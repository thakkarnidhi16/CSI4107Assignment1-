   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said late
Friday it was pledging $4 billion for NCNB Corp. of Charlotte,
N.C., to take over First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas in
potentially the largest federal bank rescue ever.
   The FDIC, which in March pumped $1 billion into banks owned by
the ailing holding company, said it will infuse an additional $2
billion to wipe out the company's negative net worth and expects
eventually to have to pay out another $1 billion to cover bad loans.
   NCNB has agreed to pay between $210 million and $240 million to
acquire a 20 percent stake in what will be called NCNB Texas
National Bank. For five years, it will have an exclusive option to
purchase the 80 percent of the bank which will be owned by the FDIC.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said Texas billionaire H. Ross
Perot had promised to act as a standby to ensure that NCNB's share
of the investment is paid in time, but said he doubted that Perot's
help would be needed.
   The First RepublicBank deal rivals the 1984 rescue of
Continental Illinois Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago, the largest bank
bailout to date. In that case, the FDIC's initial outlay was $4.5
billion, although it expects to recover all but $1.7 billion.
   Seidman said the ultimate cost of the First RepublicBank
transaction ``is expected to be significantly lower'' than the
initial outlay, but said ``it is certainly possible'' the ultimate
cost could be greater than the expected $1.7 billion cost of the
Continental Illinois deal.
   He said all of First RepublicBank's 41 subsidiary banks would
remain open under their normal schedule, including those with
Saturday hours. The banks will open under their new name on Monday.
   ``No First RepublicBank depositor will lose a single cent,''
said Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke.
   Seidman said the transaction so far was an agreement in
principle, and he said he expected it to be made final ``somewhere
in the next three months.''
   Until then, the FDIC has taken control of the banks under a
bridge bank arrangement, a new legal device authorized by Congress
last year. It is being used for only the second time. NCNB will
manage the banks on the FDIC's behalf.
   In order for the FDIC to take over First RepublicBank under
bridge bank rules, the Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator
of nationally chartered banks, and Texas regulators had to first
declare the banks owned by the holding company insolvent.
   This leaves owners of the holding company's $1.2 billion in debt
and preferred stock with little chance of being repaid. However,
the creditors of the subsidiary banks will be protected. The
company's bonds have been trading recently at below 20 cents on the
dollar.
   Seidman said ``it wouldn't surprise me if we see some lawsuits''
from bond holders.
   He said NCNB was chosen from among five bidders because it
offered ``the least costly alternative the FDIC believes was
viable.'' The next best bid would have cost the agency nearly $1
billion more, he said.
   Seidman declined to name the unsuccessful bidders. However,
published reports have identified the four: Wells Fargo & Co. of
San Francisco, Citicorp of New York, an investment group eaded by
First RepublicBank's management and another investment group headed
by former Texas Sen. John Tower.
   The FDIC, which gets its money through an assessment on the
nation's 14,000 commercial banks and guarantees deposits up to
$100,000, is having one of its worst years ever.
   Last year, 184 banks failed, a post-Depression record, and equal
number or slightly more are expected to fail this year.
   All this is expected to cause the FDIC's insurance fund to
suffer its first loss this year. Seidman estimated the insurance
fund will decline by 10 percent from its $18.3 billion balance at
the end of 1987.
   ``Any time you have to spend $4 billion, it does give you pause.
... But I believe this will be good for Texas and I believe it is
appropriate from the stand point of the insurance fund,'' Seidman
said.
   First RepublicBank, the largest bank holding company in Texas
with $32.5 billion in assets, posted a net loss of $2.3 billion for
the first six months of 1988.
   On June 30, it reported nonperforming assets, or loans that
aren't being paid back, of $5.13 billion, more than 20 percent of
its total loans outstanding. Negative net worth in assets minus
liabilities was about $1.1 billion.
   The deal catapults NCNB, with $28.6 billion in assets, from 18th
largest bank in the nation to 10th largest, now with about $50
billion in assets. It is an ambitious institution with a reputation
as an aggressive commercial lender.
   The FDIC board, comprised of Seidman, Clarke and a third board
member, C.C. Hope, approved NCNB's offer late Friday afternoon, but
the agency did not announce the rescue until 10 p.m. EDT.
   In the intervening time, the FDIC set off the complicated chain
reaction necessary to declare First RepublicBank's subsidiaries
insolvent. It began with the FDIC's statement to the comptroller
that it would not renew its $1 billion loan to the Dallas holding
company when it became due in September and ended with the
comptroller, an official of the Treasury Department, and Texas
regulators declaring the 41 member banks insolvent and appointing
the FDIC as receiver.
   First RepublicBank, under its current charter, was created in
May 1987 when stockholders and regulators approved the merger of
InterFirst Corp. and RepublicBank Corp., creating at the time the
nation's 12th largest banking institution.
   First RepublicaBank stock, which a year ago sold at above $26
per share, dropped by 25 cents a share to 75 cents Friday in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

   A man angered when his order was
misunderstood at a fast-food restaurant drive-up window sped away
Friday, lost control of his car, and died after it hit a utility
pole and flipped, police said.
   Vance F. Martin, 25, was pronounced dead at Ball Memorial
Hospital shortly after the 2:33 a.m. accident. An autopsy showed he
died of massive head injuries, said Delaware County Coroner Jack
Stonebraker Jr.
   Martin's car struck a concrete median, became airborne for 40
feet and hit a large rock and a pole before flipping once. He was
not wearing a seat belt and was thrown from the car, police said.
   An employee at the restaurant near the accident scene told
police Martin became upset after employees could not understand his
order. When he was asked to drive to the window and place the
order, Martin left the restaurant at a high rate of speed, police
said.

   The Civil Aviation Authority today said it was
investigating a near collision between an Air U.K. passenger
airplane and an unidentified light aircraft.
   The two planes passed within 200 feet of one another over
Suffolk, the easternmost county in England, on Thursday night, the
authority said.
   The pilot of the Air U.K. plane filed a complaint after landing
at Stansted Airport, 60 miles southeast of London, on a flight from
Paris. The plane carried 17 people.
   The authority said it was the 28th reported near collision over

   The Federal Aviation Administration has
ordered a special inspection of landing gear brakes on long-range
McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aircraft.
   The agency also directed that the brakes be replaced if they
exceed prescribed wear limits.
   Friday's order came in response to a May 21 accident involving
an American Airlines DC-10 last May in which eight of the plane's
10 brakes failed when the pilot aborted his takeoff.
   In that incident the plane skidded 1,000 feet beyond the runway
at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, the three cockpit crewmembers and
five of the 240 passengers were injured and the plane was heavily
damaged.
   The inspection order becomes effective Aug. 20, although
inspections may begin before that, said agency spokesman Dick
Stafford.
   The FAA directive applies only to McDonnell Douglas DC-10 Series
30 and Series 40 planes, the somewhat heavier long-range version of
the aircraft, said Stafford.

   The Treasury Department has announced it is
imposing the first civil penalty fines in its efforts to halt money
laundering along the border with Mexico.
   The department said Friday it is levied a $3.01 million fined on
Oscar's Money Exchange of Hidalgo, Texas, and its owner, Oscar
Ortiz Alvarez, and another man, Antonio Franco.
   Franco's organization was accused of violating the Bank Secrecy
Act by alledgedly laundering $5.56 million through Oscar's Money
Exchange. Federal agents in June 1987 seized $2.55 million. The
remaining $3.01 million was transported to Mexico by Alvarez and
others without filing the necessary forms with the U.S. Customs
Service, the department said.
   The Bank Secrecy Act requires anyone transporting cash of
$10,000 or more outside the country to notify the Customs Service.
   Alvarez, arrested in McAllen, Texas, on Thursday, was charged in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas with
money laundering.
   The department said Franco is serving 35 years in a federal
prison after being convicted of participating in a drug smuggling
and distribution ring.

   The General Services Administration says it
will wait until the end of the year to award bids for an all-new
federal telephone system known as FTS 2000.
   In a brief statement, the GSA said Friday the award of the
contracts, scheduled for Sept. 30, was delayed ``to make available
additional time for evaluating the large amount of technical and
financial bid data.''
   The contracts, worth as much as $25 billion over 10 years, were
originally scheduled to have been awarded by the end of 1987.
However, that date slipped when the GSA, under pressure from
Congress, decided to split the contract, with 60 percent going to
one vendor and 40 percent to another.
   US Sprint Communications Co., a team headed by American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. and another headed by Martin Marietta
Corp. with MCI Communications Corp. have placed bids for the
contract, one of the biggest ever let by the government.
   AT&T spokesman Herb Linnen said the company was ``very

   A bomb ripped through a busy
shopping plaza today, injuring 57 people, seven of them critically,
police said.
   Elsewhere, a mine exploded at a bus stop, an explosive device
was defused at a theater and seven people were killed in scattered
violence.
   The incidents occurred one day after the government banned the
anti-apartheid film ``Cry Freedom'' after it was shown in theaters
nationwide.
   The bomb at the shopping plaza exploded just after noon in a
fast-food restaurant in Benoni, a white suburb 12 miles east of
Johannesburg, said police spokesman G.J. Everson.
   Police initially said one person was killed, but another
spokesman, Lt. Willem Meyer, said later that no deaths had been
confirmed. He said the seven people in critical condition had been
taken to Johannesburg Hospital.
   The Wimpy's hamburger restaurant and adjacent shops were badly
damaged, with windows shattered throughout the two-story plaza,
Meyer said. The plaza was packed with shoppers, most of them white,
witnesses said. However, some of those injured were black, the
witnesses added.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast.
   Police have blamed virtualy all of more than 90 bombings in
South Africa during a 25-month state-of-emergency on the outlawed
African National Congress, the main black guerrilla group fighting
the white-led government. The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, seldom
confirms or denies involvement in the attacks.
   In a separate incident, a suspected limpet mine exploded today
at a bus stop in Germiston, 10 miles southeast of Johannesburg. It
slightly injured one person, police said. No one claimed
responsibility.
   Such mines can be attached to another surface.
   In Pretoria, the South African capital, police today discovered
an explosive device at a Metro theater complex, where ``Cry
Freedom'' was shown Friday. Police cordoned off the area and bomb
experts defused the device.
   It was discovered one day after police confiscated copies of the
film seven hours after it opened in more than 30 theaters
nationwide.
   The film, about black activist Steve Biko, had been approved by
censors but police said two explosions at theaters, bomb threats
and violent scenes in the movie proved it was a threat to public
safety.
   Elsewhere, seven blacks were killed in five separate attacks
over the past 24 hours in the Natal province and the Soweto
township outside Johannesburg, police said in their daily unrest
report.
   One black man was fatally stabbed and three seriously injured
when they were attacked by black students in Soweto, a police
statement said.
   In Natal, the site of ongoing factional fighting, three men were
stabbed to death when a group of blacks attacked a private home,
police said.
   In two other incidents, a group of blacks stabbed a woman to
death and a private vehicle was set on fire, killing the only
occupant, the report said.
   One additional man was stabbed to death in Natal in an attack on
a private home, the report said.
   The sketchy police unrest statement covers incidents reported
during the previous 24 hours, but gives few details.

   Michael Dukakis today ridiculed
Republican rival George Bush's pledge to be an ``education
president,'' telling a Kentucky rally the nation needs a president
who will focus on education ``not just during election years.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, was wrapping up a seven-state
campaign swing today with appearances in Louisville and Raleigh,
N.C. He has stressed his message of economic opportunity throughout
the trip, and today focused on education as a vital part of his
``good jobs at good wages'' formula.
   ``We need a president who will be out nation's No. 1 advocate
for educational excellence, not just for some of our children, but
for all of our children,'' the Massachusetts governor told an
outdoor breakfast rally along the banks of the Ohio River.
   ``Not just during election years, but every year,'' he said.
   Dukakis repeated his pledge to sponsor loan-forgiveness and
other programs to encourage college students to become teachers and
his pledge to provide student loans to any high school graduate who
is accepted by a college or university.
   ``No youngster who completes high school and is qualified to do
college work should ever be denied that opportunity because of
financial need,'' Dukakis told the rally.
   Dukakis brought his campaign to Kentucky after criticizing
Bush's day care plan and the Reagan administration's handling of
the Pentagon scandal and slumping regional economies.
   Bush, in turn, challenged the Democratic nominee's contention in
his acceptance speech last week that the race is about competence
rather than ideology. The vice president and certain Republican
nominee called such talk a ruse that ``just masks over his far-left
philosophy.''
   Bush also planned to hit hard on the issues where Republicans
consider Dukakis the weakest _ foreign policy and defense _ when he
goes on the road next week, his campaign said.
   Dukakis was to take part of his time today to meet with
candidates for state director posts in several Southern states and
also with supporters of vanquished rivals Jesse Jackson and
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
   Another former rival, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, stood by
Dukakis' side Friday as the nominee addressed a rally in the
Illinois capital of Springfield.
   ``You need a partner in the White House, a federal partner who
will work with you, who will not accept second best or second
rate,'' said Dukakis, accusing Reagan of ignoring regions of the
country whose economies are struggling.
   Dukakis joked about finishing behind Simon and Jackson in the
Illinois primary and urged those at the rally to vote Democratic in
November.
   ``We've got to join together around some very fundamental values
that unite all Democrats, unite all Americans.''
   As he had earlier in the day in Flint, Mich., and Sturtevant,
Wis., Dukakis said laissez-faire management by the Reagan Defense
Department had contributed to the Pentagon procurement scandal.
   ``My friends, in a Dukakis administration we're not going to
surrender our national security to greed and corruption,'' Dukakis
told the Springfield rally. ``We're not going to use our defense
dollars to line the pockets of Washington consultants. We're going
to pay for the tanks and equipment and training the men and women
of our armed forces need and deserve.''
   Earlier, at a Wisconsin news conference, Dukakis said Bush's
plan to give a $1,000 tax credit to families who need day care was
inferior to a Democratic-sponsored plan before the Congress.
   ``I don't know anyone who is serious about child care who thinks
that makes sense,'' Dukakis said of the Bush plan.
   But he refused to endorse the $2.5 billion price tag the
congressional bill carries.
   Bush, appearing Friday at a day care center in a Washington
suburb, touted his program, saying the problem is too diverse and
complicated for a centralized agency to handle. ``You have to have
choice, parental choice, family choice, and you have to have
diversity,'' he said.
   Bush also told reporters the issues in the presidential campaign
are still ``all blurred out there right now.''
   ``The Democrats had a good convention, but offered no
specifics,'' Bush said. ``My opponent's suggestion that ideology
doesn't matter just masks over his far-left philosophy.''
   Bush planned to go on the offensive next week with speeches in
Chicago on Tuesday and Corpus Christi, Texas, on Thursday.
   ``He will keep discussing issues. And when the issues come in
focus, the polls will start closing,'' Campaign manager Lee Atwater
said, referring to the 18-point lead Dukakis has had over Bush in
polling since the Democratic National Convention.
   At the White House, meanwhile, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater accused Dukakis of being ``for a weaker defense,'' a
contention that the Dukakis campaign quickly challenged.
   Also on Friday, President Reagan approved a 30-day extension of
Secret Service protection for Jackson, at a cost Reagan estimated
at $600,000. Fitzwater said the extension addressed Jackson's
concerns about threats against his life but would not last through
the fall campaign.

   An upcoming report by a U.N. team
investigating chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war is largely a
devastating account of Iraqi atrocities, diplomatic sources said.
   A U.N. team of military experts planned weekend talks in
Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, to work out details for a cease-fire in
the eight-year Persian Gulf war. The team conducted talks in
Tehran, the Iranian capital, this week.
   A second team investigating the situation of prisoners of war
was to leave Tehran for Baghdad over the weekend.
   On Friday, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he
still was unable to bridge differences between Iran and Iraq over
the issue of face-to-face peace talks.
   Iraq demands direct talks with Iran before accepting a
cease-fire. Iran wants a cease-fire first.
   The secretary-general said he expects more meetings with both
sides today.
   ``Both sides still are interested in a solution of the
problem,'' he told reporters after meeting separately with envoys
from the two countries at U.N. headquarters in New York. ``They
have a divergence, which is only normal.''
   Saudi Arabia, a major supporter of Iraq and financier of its war
with Iran, has joined the ranks of nations trying to pressure
Baghdad to compromise and agree to an immediate cease-fire,
diplomatic sources said today.
   Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz, Saudia Arabia's U.S.
ambassador, met privately with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
and Perez de Cuellar on Friday. Diplomatic sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the prince, a member of the Saudi
royal family, was trying to persuade Iraq to drop its insistence on
face-to-face talks with Iran before a cease-fire is declared.
   The chemical weapons report, detailing Iraq's extensive use of
the outlawed weapons, is to be released Monday, diplomatic sources
said on condition of anonymity. They said the report would
undermine Iraq's position and mobilize international opinion
against Baghdad.
   Iraq has acknowleged the use of chemical weapons, which are
banned under the 1925 Geneva Convention. But Iraq contends Iran
introduced chemical weapons to the war.
   In one of the latest claims of chemical warfare use, Iran's
Islamic Republic News Agency today said Iraqi forces chemically
bombed a village just inside the border near the town of Marivan in
northwestern Iran. It said 10 civilians were injured.
   After meeting Friday with Perez de Cuellar, Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati of Iran said his country could consider direct talks
with Iraq after a cease-fire, troop withdrawal and prisoner
exchange. He ruled out direct talks at this time.
   Tariq Aziz later met the U.N. chief for about 45 minutes and
left without making a statement. But Middle East diplomats,
speaking on condition they not be identified, said Iraq had not
softened its demand for direct talks.
   Perez de Cuellar arranged the talks after Iran announced last
week, after a year's delay, that it would accept a Security Council
resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire and setting out a
peace plan.
   Details of the secretary-general's proposals to Iran and Iraq
have not been disclosed.
   Velayati said Iran considered the proposal in general to be
positive, would study it further and respond officially today.
   Perez de Cuellar also said Friday he was ``very hopeful'' that
U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins would be released soon by
his captors in Lebanon.
   The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution Friday condemning
the February kidnapping of Higgins and demanding his immediate
release.
   Higgins, head of a U.N. military observer group, was kidnapped
by pro-Iranian extremists, but the Security Council resolution did
not mention his abductors or their sympathies.
   Perez de Cuellar already has raised the Higgins case with
Velayati and asked Iran to use its influence with the kidnappers of
Higgins and other American and foreign hostages.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war in the Persian Gulf since
September 1980, with the loss of about a million lives.

<HEAD>Arrest Warrant Issued For Hosea Williams</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arrest warrant has been issued for City
Councilman and veteran civil rights activist Hosea Williams, who is
accused of trying to board an airplane with a handgun.
   Williams was indicted Thursday on a single count of possession
of a firearm by a convicted felon. The incident allegedly occurred
in March at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.
   ``We have been in contact with Mr. Williams and he has indicated
he will turn himself in,'' said Stanley Tuggle, chief of
administrative operations for the Clayton County Sheriff's
Department. Calls to Williams went unanswered Saturday.
   Police said they found a .38-caliber handgun and five bullets
inside Williams' briefcase when he was stopped March 6 at an
airport security checkpoint.
   Williams, 62, told police he had put the gun in his briefcase
while cleaning out his car and was allowed to board the plane after
the gun and ammunition were confiscated.
   At first he was charged only with misdemeanors, but the charges
were upgraded to a felony count after a review of Williams' record,
Tuggle said.
   In addition to arrests during the civil rights era, Williams has

   Some employees wore black arm bands
and others propped up a makeshift cardboard tombstone reading
R.I.P. as the last box of Tide detergent was packed and shipped
from the Procter & Gamble factory here.
   The lid on the last box of Tide was sealed Thursday, and the
doors to the factory itself are to be sealed Oct. 2, as the product
maker prepares to shut the plant forever.
   For 57 years the once-bustling plant manufactured a variety of
products that have become household names: Tide, Crisco cooking
oil, Safeguard bar soap and other synthetic detergent lines.
Procter & Gamble will continue to make the products, but not in
Long Beach.
   The property, about 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, has
been purchased by the Port of Long Beach for the construction of a
containerized freight terminal.
   A marching band from a nearby high school played during the
bittersweet closing ceremonies. Employees celebrated with a cake
emblazoned with the words ``In Commemoration of 57 Years of
Production.''
   A few employees will go to new jobs at other Procter & Gamble
plants. Most will retire or be looking for other work.

   A series of slashings and
beatings of horses, carried out on full moons in this seaside
community, has left one horse dead and seven others injured, police
say.
   The nighttime attacks date back to October and some owners have
speculated they may be cult-related. However, no arrests have been
made.
   The latest attack occurred Wednesday when a chestnut quarter
horse worth $3,000 was stabbed in the stomach while in its stall at
Green Stables, said Cathy Clarke, the stable's manager.
   The horse, which was wounded so badly it had to be destroyed,
was found by its owner, who arrived at the stable early Thursday to
feed the animal, Ms. Clarke said.
   All eight attacks have occurred at a pair of stables in
Huntington Beach, about 35 miles southwest of Los Angeles.
   Other animals have been slashed and beaten, and one pony's tail
was cut off and tied to a stall's railing, Ms. Clarke said.

   The former chief fund-raiser for a charity
dedicated to fighting eye disease has been arrested for
investigation of forgery in the disappearance of $50,000, police
said.
   Daniel J. Sonners of Malibu surrendered Friday to officers
investigating the disappearance of checks and money belonging to
Retinitis Pigmentosa International, said police detective Anthony
DiRuscio. He was released on $1,000 bail.
   Police recovered 12 charity checks totaling about $41,000 that
had been forged and cashed at banks in the San Fernando Valley,
where Retinitis Pigmentosa International is based, DiRuscio said.
   Helen Harris, founder of the 15-year-old charity, said checks
totaling $50,553 were apparently forged and the charity's bank
accounts looted while she was on vacation earlier this month.
   The loss has crippled the charity, leaving it with only $2,600,
Ms. Harris said.
   However, she said word of the loss has sparked a new round of
donations, including 150 tickets to two Los Angeles Pops concerts
that the charity group was given to sell.

   Two Czechoslovak activists were detained
in separate incidents for anti-government activities, including
supporting Soviet-style reforms and blaming the government for the
death of another activist, emigre sources said Saturday.
   The two could each face prison sentences of up to three years,
according to the Czechoslovak sources in Vienna, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   According to the sources, police detained Miroslav Polak on May
5 after he blamed police and the courts for the death in prison of
human rights activist Pavel Wonka. Wonka died in April.
   The sources, quoting a statement by the Committee in Defense of
the Unjustly Persecuted, said Polak made the remarks to a friend
while riding a streetcar.
   The sources said police forced the activist and his friend, who
was not identified, into a police car immediately after their
conversation.
   Polak, a member of the Charter 77 human rights group, was
released the next day. He was charged with swearing at and
physically attacking police while under the influence of alcohol,
the statement said.
   In a separate incident, Jaroslav Popelka, an activist from the
city of Brno, about 130 miles southeast of Prague, was arrested
April 14 after distributing leaflets calling on the Czechoslovak
government to implement Soviet-style reforms, the sources said,
quoting the statement.
   They said Popelka, 32, demanded the resignation of some
Czechoslovak leaders and called on citizens to demonstrate
peacefully for change.
   Police confiscated manuscripts and a typewriter during searches
of the apartments of Popelka and his brother, according to the
sources.
   They said Popelka was released from custody May 13 but was
detained again June 17, allegedly because he refused to cease his
activities. He was charged with disturbing the peace, the sources
said.

   The new Burmese government of hardliner
Sein Lwin arrested a major opposition figure, at least 10 other
critics and an Associated Press reporter, Western diplomats said
today.
   Aung Gyi, who once was considered a likely presidential
successor, was among those seized during a roundup of dissidents
late Friday and early today, said diplomats contacted in Rangoon,
the Burmese capital.
   The reported sweep took place one week after Burmese leader Ne
Win resigned as chairman of the ruling party and set in motion
changes which appear to have brought even more hard-line leaders
into power.
   Aung Gyi, 70, had written a series of letters sharply critical
of economic and political conditions in Burma, the site of recent
student unrest. Aung Gyi targeted Sein Lwin, new chairman of the
Burma Socialist Program Party, for criticism in connection with the
bloody suppression of the student protests.
   There has been no official announcement of the arrests, the
first known crackdown on dissidents since Sein Lwin assumed the
chairmanship on Tuesday.
   In Washington, Nancy Beck, a State Department spokeswoman, said
U.S. officials in Burma ``understand that perhaps as many as 25
people have been arrested,'' including Aung Gyi and Associated
Press correspondent Sein Win.
   She said U.S. officials have no other details on the arrests.
``We are making inquiries but are limited in what we can do by the
fact that Sein Win is a Burmese, not a U.S. citizen,'' she said.
   The Western diplomats, reached by telephone from Bangkok, said
Sein Win was taken from his home in the northern suburbs of Rangoon
by authorities at around midnight Friday. The diplomats spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In a brief telex to the Associated Press bureau in Bangkok, Sein
Win's family said, ``Daddy has been taken away. He won't be be
available to answer your queries.'' The message was received
shortly after his arrest.
   The 66-year-old newsman, former publisher of the
English-language daily, The Guardian, was jailed for three years in
the 1960s in connection with his journalistic activities. In 1963
he was awarded the Golden Pen of Freedom by the Paris-based
International Federation of Journalists for his work in fostering a
free press in Burma.
   Aung Gyi, a onetime comrade-in-arms of Ne Win, sided with the
general when he staged a 1962 coup against the civilian government.
Aung Gyi served as vice chairman of the Revolutionary Council and
Minister for Trade Development and Industries.
   Regarded then as his probable successor, the pragmatic,
relatively liberal Aung Gyi fell out with Ne Win over plans to
nationalize the economy and resigned from his positions in 1963. He
was subsequently jailed.
   Recently he re-emerged in the public eye through a series of
critical letters unprecedented in the rigidly controlled country.
Although addressed to Ne Win and other Burmese leaders, the letters
were widely circulated in Rangoon and _ according to one Burmese
source _ ``sold like hotcakes.''
   Aung Gyi refrained from attacking Ne Win personally but sharply
criticized men around him and the general state of the country.
   ``That the country has gone from bad to worse (26) years after
the seizure of power is evident to anyone not living in a fool's
paradise...,'' he wrote in a May 12 letter. ``The country has
plunged to the bottom politically, economically and socially. The
moral decay is the most deplorable.''
   Letters dated June 8 and July 19 attacked Sein Lwin by reference
to his party position, for ``turning a blind eye'' to ``all kinds
of human rights violations.''
   Army troops reportedly called in by Sein Lwin _ and riot troops
he is widely said to have commanded _ brutally supressed student
demonstrations in the capital earlier this year. Aung Gyi, giving
gruesome detail of rapes and beatings, claimed that 283 persons
died in the riots.
   Aung Gyi was in turn sharply criticized by Ne Win and delegates
to the recent party congress at which Ne Win offered his resignation
   Sein Win, who joined the Associated Press shortly after being
released from prison in 1968, earlier served on the executive board
of the International Press Institute. When publishing The Guardian,
Sein Win also founded the first national news agency in Burma.
   His first jail term of one year came in the waning days of the
civilian government of Prime Minister U Nu. Along with thousands of
other political prisoners, he was incarcerated for two years by the
Ne Win regime.
   On Friday, meanwhile, anti-government posters were affixed to
Burma's holiest shrine, the Shwedagon Pagoda, in the first known
public protest since Sein Lwin took over power.
   Pilgrims returning from worship at the soaring, gold-laden
shrine said a small number of young students mounted water tanks at
the Shwedagon on Thursday evening, giving anti-government speeches
and shouting slogans.
   The students returned before noon Friday but there were no
reports of violence or confrontation with authorities.

<TEXT>
   Here are the main goals of the peace plan for Central America,
signed Aug. 7 by the presidents of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras,
El Salvador and Nicaragua:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Negotiated cease-fires in Nicaragua and El Salvador, which are
both engaged in civil wars, and in Guatemala and Honduras, which
are trying to suppress leftist insurgencies.
   The conflicts in the four countries have claimed a total of
nearly 200,000 lives in the past decade.
   _Amnesties for political offenders in all four countries.
Nicaragua and El Salvador have declared limited, conditional
amnesties for their political prisoners.
   The plan does not clearly define to whom amnesty should be
granted _ political prisoners, armed opponents or both. Therefore,
application of amnesty differs in the five countries.
   _Democratization, defined by the plan as meaning full freedom of
the press and other media and the right of dissident political
groups to assemble and promote their views.
   Direct or indirect political repression continues in all the
countries except Costa Rica, which has had peace and democracy
since 1948.
   _Lifting of emergency or martial law. At the time the plan was
signed, only Nicaragua had such a law. But Amnesty International
and other human rights organizations say restrictions on freedom
were also enforced in the other countries through fear of execution
by right-wing death squads or leftist terrorists.
   _An end to all outside aid to the region's insurgents. Until
February, the United States provided military and humanitarian aid
to the Contras battling the Nicaraguan government, which in turn
receives military aid from Soviet bloc countries. El Salvador's
president Jose Napoleon Duarte claims Nicaragua is also channeling
aid to leftists trying to overthrow his government.
   _An end to the use of any country's territory by groups or
individuals seeking the overthrow of a neighboring government. This
is aimed primarily at Honduras, where the Nicaraguan rebels have
maintained camps.

   Millions of substandard bolts and nuts have
been used in everything from military equipment and weapons to the
space shuttle and commercial trucks, a congressional committee said
Saturday.
   ``The millions and perhaps billions of substandard fasteners
used by our military and sensitive industries make it a wonder that
we haven't had a major catastrophe,'' said Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and
its investigations subcommittee.
   A two-year-long investigation by the subcommittee uncovered
millions of substandard bolts, nuts, and screws _ many of them
imported from Japan _ and Dingell said the problem could have
wide-ranging effects.
   For example, 1,200 M-60 tanks were removed from Army front lines
for at least two months while defective bolts in the gun mounts
were replaced, and substandard fasteners were sold to the Navy for
use on both submarines and aircraft carrier jet catapult systems,
the panel said.
   The fasteners contained more boron and less carbon than
specified in industry standards, making them more likely to break
or shear, the panel said.
   As the report was being prepared, Dingell and 50 other House
members introduced legislation to try to correct the problem.
   The bill would require laboratory testing and greater
documentation of fasteners to make it more difficult to substitute
cheaper and less effective parts.
   ``We must take steps to ensure that the fasteners sold to
industry and government in this country meet the standards
necessary to hold our products together,'' said Rep. Thomas J.
Bliley of Virginia, ranking Republican on the subcommittee.
   The report said about 7 billion bolts and large screws are used
annually by U.S. industry, including about 1.5 billion of the
high-strength 8.0-grade fasteners.
   The Pentagon has purchased millions of the bad bolts and is
still trying to track them all down, the panel said.
   Tests of fasteners purchased by the Defense Industrial Supply
Center from a variety of lots showed a defective rate of more than
30 percent, the panel noted, which would mean 30 million bad bolts
in the 100 million 8.0-grade fasteners purchased every two years.
   The investigation by the Army into the M-60 tank problem found
that screws in the gun mounts of 1,200 tanks were substandard.
   ``The screws proved to be defective and failed when the main gun
was fired, disabling the gun and threatening the lives of the
crew,'' the report said.
   The Army has also found substandard bolts on its M-109
self-propelled howitzers, mortar carriers, personnel carriers, TOW
missile carriers, and a variety of trucks and other utility
vehicles, the panel said.
   Army officials told the panel last year they were working to
correct the problem.
   The Navy has also run into problems, the panel said. At the
request of the service, shipyards last summer tested their stocks
of bolts and found 58 percent were defective.
   In one instance, the defective bolts were scheduled to be
installed in the aircraft catapults aboard the Enterprise and the
Carl Vinson, two aircraft carriers.
   Problems have also turned up at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, the panel found. NASA has discovered broken
and deformed bolts in the attach rings that hold the solid rocket
boosters on the external fuel tank of the space shuttle.
   In addition, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has ``been aware
of serious fastener problems in nuclear power plants for a number
of years,'' the report said.
   The NRC doesn't think there is a radiation safety problem
because of the defective fasteners, the report added.
   A number of criminal investigations of bolt suppliers are
underway, the panel noted. For example, the Defense Criminal
Investigative Service and the Customs Service are conducting 26
investigations.
   The Customs probes focused on importers who purchased
substandard fasteners from Japan, the panel noted. In addition,
other criminal investigations focused on fasteners built in Japan,
Korea, Taiwan and Poland and shipped into the United States through
Canada.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has demanded urgent action
from top Communist Party officials to solve the day-to-day problems
of Soviet citizens, including lack of good food and hours wasted
standing in line.
   ``In our work, we have become involved with many economic
affairs, while sometimes overlooking issues directly bearing on
people's lives,'' the Soviet leader acknowledged Friday at a
meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee.
   His remarks were reported Saturday by the Communist Party daily
Pravda.
   Gorbachev was quoted as telling the plenary session of his
party's policy-making body that the government must act swiftly to
better the lot of citizens.
   ``The resolution of the highly important issues determining the
living standards of the people is long overdue, and the lag in that
field has become chronic,'' he said.
   Gorbachev has acknowledged that until ordinary citizens' own
lives improve, many will remain unconvinced that his program for
``perestroika,'' or economic and social restructuring, is working.
   At a national party conference that ended July 1, many delegates
complained that Gorbachev's ambitious economic and social reforms
failed to put meat on store shelves or to improve the quality of
goods.
   In his speech Friday, Gorbachev said the 13-member ruling
Politburo had mapped out a proposed plan of action to improve
``food, trade, consumer goods and services, that is, everything
that directly concerns people, that is related to their daily needs
and concerns.''
   He said even Soviet defense industry plants should be made to
produce consumer goods now in short supply.
   To improve the chronically limited supply of food, Gorbachev
called for ``urgent and cardinal measures, both immediate and
long-term.''
   Bread and some other food products are abundant and cheaply
priced in state-run Soviet food stores, but the selection of fruits
and vegetables is far more limited than in the West, and in some
areas, products like sugar and meat are still rationed.
   Gorbachev said it was possible to increase wholesale purchases
of cattle and poultry by 2.5 million tons, and milk by 4.3 million
tons, in 1990, the final year of a current five-year economic plan.
   By that year, he said, the country could be producing enough to
meet recommended dietary norms for its citizens in bread, macaroni,
vegetables, candy, cereals, potatoes, butter, whole-milk products,
eggs and poultry.
   `We won't be able to do so as regards meat and fruits in this
period,'' Gorbachev noted. ``But there too, the situation could be
mended seriously.''
   Gorbachev directed some of his most poignant remarks at a
problem that has longed seemed synonymous with Soviet life _ long
lines.
   ``There are lines everywhere _ in trade, in the service sector,
in transport, in public health institutions, and in organizations
and offices which have to act on various requests of working
people,'' he declared.
   When he visited a Moscow shoe factory, Gorbachev said, a mother
of two who works there complained to him: ``Mikhail Sergeyevich,
every day I have to spend two and sometimes even three hours
queuing in stores. This is exhausting. I don't get as tired on the
job as I do in the lines.''
   Gorbachev said it was ``a shame that many high-placed officials
calmly look at lines and do not deem it necessary to do anything to
eliminate them ... This is nothing but a disrespectful and callous
attitude to people.''
   Reports carried by Pravda and other state-run media on the
Central Committee meeting did not specify what action the body's
more than 300 members took on Gorbachev's proposals.
   In his speech, Gorbachev also called for:
   _Creation of a powerful consumer goods industry that would
enlist the country's military-industrial complex and heavy industry
to produce $38 billion more in consumer goods than originally
planned for 1989-90.
   _Leasing of farmland to individuals for as long as 50 years, so
that peasants and not bureaucrats can take direct control of
tilling the soil.
   _Reduction of office space now occupied by government and party
workers.

   As an outgrowth of the new era in
Soviet-American relations, the United States has been casting a far
more benign eye toward Moscow's allies in Eastern Europe, engaging
in contacts that would have seemed impossible just two years ago.
   For years, Washington tended to look on the East Europeans as
submissive step children of Moscow, with little room for maneuver
either in their internal or external policies.
   But since the advent of the Gorbachev era in 1985, the Reagan
administration has been quietly expanding its contacts among East
bloc countries, especially Poland and Hungary.
   These efforts bore fruit this past week with the first visit
ever to Washington by a Hungarian Communist Party leader and the
first in nine years by a Polish foreign minister.
   Contacts elsewhere have been accelerating as well. Deputy
Secretary of State John Whitehead, who has been given special
responsibility for Eastern Europe, has visited each of the bloc
countries at least twice.
   The assistant secretary of state for European affairs, Rozanne
Ridgway, has had a particular interest in Eastern Europe since her
days as ambassador to East Germany and has worked hard on
developing closer ties with bloc countries.
   There has been a more active dialogue with Bulgaria lately. But
Romania, which once received special treatment because of its
willingness to disagree with Moscow, has fallen from favor after
renouncing a beneficial trade arrangement it had with the United
States.
   U.S. relations with Poland hit bottom in 1981 when the
administration slapped on a series of sanctions after Polish
authorities imposed martial law. The administration responded to
gradual political liberalization by lifting sanctions one by one
until the last of the measures was lifted in 1987.
   ``We have normalized our relations,'' Foreign Minister Tadeusz
Olechowski said Thursday after a meeting with Secretary of State
George P. Shultz. He invited Shultz to reciprocate his visit.
   More noteworthy was the visit the previous day of Hungarian
Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz with President Reagan. Grosz,
who was named to that post in May after serving as premier for the
past year, has done much to alter Hungary's image as the hapless
victim of Soviet heavy-handedness, reflected in the Soviet Army's
crushing of an anti-Soviet revolt in 1956.
   Like Mikhail Gorbachev, Grosz is an advocate of economic and
political reform to remedy Hungary's economic problems, winning
plaudits from U.S. officials for his daring departures.
   ``We have been impressed with your openness to new ideas,''
Reagan told Grosz on Wednesday.
   As Grosz carried out his U.S. travels, it was sometimes easy to
overlook his Marxist underpinnings. He spent 11 days on his U.S.
tour, moving easily among business people and others while visiting
California, New York and Illinois, where he witnessed the signing
of a $115 million joint venture between a U.S. glass firm and a
Hungarian enterprise.
   Both Poland and Hungary are plagued by huge foreign debts and
are eager for greater access to U.S. markets. But as Warsaw Pact
allies of the Soviet Union, their purchases of American products
will have to be limited to non-strategic items.
   And, although both Poland and Hungary give their citizens more
freedom than other bloc countries, both remain committed to
continuing one-party rule.
   Their military alliances with Moscow appear to be very much
intact at this point as well. The Soviets have 65,000 troops in
Hungary and 40,000 in Poland.
   Still, American officials are pleased with the evolution in both
countries. Grosz in particular has a popular following for his
willingness to expand the capitalist sector and to encourage more
foreign private investment.
   Grosz said Tuesday he is trying ``to establish something new,
something more modern, something more efficient in the interest of
developing the Hungarian nation.''
   That same evening, another Moscow ally, Cuban President Fidel
Castro, made it plain that Grosz-style economic liberalization is
not for him.
   ``We have to guard the ideological purity of our revolution,''
Castro said in a speech. ``We can't use any method that smells of
capitalism ... Cuba will never adopt any method, style, philosophy
or idiosyncrasy of capitalism.''

   A shooting rampage that left a bus driver
dead may have been an act of random revenge for the death of a
woman who was killed by another bus, according to police who have
arrested two of the woman's sons.
   Dave Palmer, 29, and Don Palmer, 25, both of Oakland, have been
arrested and accused of boarding a public bus Friday morning and
opening fire with a semi-automatic assault rifle, said Officer Doug
Crain.
   Driver Billy ``B.J.'' Givens, 43, was killed and four passengers
were wounded, two seriously, in the 1:30 a.m. attack.
   The brothers were arrested Friday afternoon after investigators
focused on rumors that the shooting was revenge for the death of
Ellen Palmer, 52, the men's mother. Palmer's compact car was
broadsided Thursday by an AC Transit bus after she ran a red light,
police said.
   Palmer, a mother of 12 who was an elementary school aide, died
from injuries sustained when the bus carried her car about 50 feet.
The collision took place about five blocks from where the shooting
attack occurred.
   According to police, four youths boarded Givens' bus and sprayed
the inside of the vehicle with gunfire. Crain could not say whether
other suspects were still being sought after the Palmer arrests.
   Givens, who lived in Oakland with his wife and two teen-age
daughters, was not involved in the fatal accident, district
authorities said.
   The Palmer brothers will be arraigned Monday in Alameda County
Municipal Court, Crain said.
   Driver Lester Dixon said two young men entered an AC Transit
building Thursday night and asked the dispatcher ``for the name of
the driver who killed the young woman in the bus accident earlier
in the day,'' but she refused to divulge the name.

<HEAD>King Dissolves Jordan's Lower House of Parliament</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with king planning speech Sunday on

   King Hussein today signed a decree
dissolving the lower house of Parliament, the official news agency
Petra said.
   Petra also said the king ``will deliver an important speech'' on
Sunday. He is expected to outline Jordan's new policy toward the
Palestinians.
   Dissolving the Chamber of Deputies appeared to be another
attempt to distance Jordan from Palestinian affairs in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. On Thursday, King
Hussein canceled a $1.3 billion development plan for Palestinians
in the occupied territories.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt during the 1967 Middle East war. Half the 60 members of
Jordan's Chamber of Deputies were from the West Bank.
   Information Minister Hani Khasawneh said a ``consultative
council might replace the lower house of Parliament within the next
few days.''
   Another Jordanian official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said dissolving the lower house will give the Palestine Liberation
Organization greater responsiblity over West Bank and Gaza Strip
affairs.
   ``This move is similar to the king's decision of a funding cut
and we expecting other similar moves in the next few days,'' the
official said.
   Khasawneh said Jordan intended to close all joint institutions
with the Palestinians, including a joint Jordanian-Palestinian
committee which finances educational and other services in the
occupied lands.
   He said Jordan's changing relationship with Palestinians was
aimed at ``avoiding friction'' between this country and the PLO.
   Since December, the occupied lands have been wracked by
Palestinian protests against Israeli rule. Since the uprising began
Dec. 8, more than 230 Palestinians and four Israelis have been
killed. Leaders of the uprising are tied to the PLO, which helps
finance the protests.
   The lower house of Jordan's Parliament was first elected in
April 1967, two months before the Middle East war. It was suspended
in 1974, following the Rabat summit resolution which recognized the
PLO as the only legitimate representative world's 5 million
Palestinians.
   In 1978, a National Consultative Council composed of 80 members
replaced the Chamber of Deputies. In January 1984, a royal decree
reinstated the lower house and it remained in session until today.
   When Jordan canceled the development plant, government officials
said the move was designed to hand over more responsibility for the
1.5 million Arabs in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to the
PLO.
   Meron Benvenisti, an Israeli expert on the West Bank, said he
thought the move was the first step toward a decision by King
Hussein eventually to cut ties with the occupied lands altogether.
   ``He wants to see how people react. But ultimately he has no
choice but to cut ties,'' Benvenisti, head of the West Bank Data
Bank, a U.S.-funded research project, said earlier this week.
   ``If he doesn't, he gives money to people who in the long run
are his enemies,'' said Benvenisti, referring to a growing
anti-Jordanian slant among West Bank Palestinians.
   Palestinian leaders in the West Bank were divided on the impact
of the cancellation of the development plan. Some said it would
seriously hurt residents already struggling financially because of
the uprising.
   Israeli officials said the cancellation of the development plan
would have no practical effect because it existed primarily on
paper.
   According to Article 34 in the Jordanian Constitution, the king
has the power to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies. A Parliament
with members from both side of the River Jordan was originally
conceived in 1950 when the late King Abdullah, King Hussein's
grandfather, united the two banks.

<HEAD>Hope Diamond Displayed After Four Days Locked In Vault</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 44.4 carat Hope Diamond went back on
display at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History today after
its vault door had failed to open for four days, museum officials
said.
   Since Tuesday, thousands of visitors who throng daily into the
museum's Hall of Gems had been confronted with a sign reading, ``We
regret that the Hope Diamond cannot be displayed today.''
   Something apparently went wrong with the vault's time lock or it
was misset, said museum spokesman Tom Harney.
   ``The men that maintain the safe are checking it out. We should
be able to tell next week what went wrong,'' he said.
   Harney said museum officials were always confident the diamond
was safe inside the vault but feared they may have to drill through
the door if it hadn't opened on its own Saturday morning.
   The blue diamond from India has been owned by the museum since
1958.

<HEAD>Charities Fear U.S. Drought May Cut Food to Hungry Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRA J. DREYFUSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON (AP) = International relief groups fear their feeding
programs abroad may be reduced because the drought in the United
States has driven up the cost of commodities they buy with federal
aid.
   While the severity of the cutbacks will become clearer after
current supplies are used up, possibly as early as December,
officials of the private voluntary organizations are concerned for
the people they feed.
   ``If prices continue to rise, there will be some cutbacks,''
says Janice Westcott, senior program officer for the Africa region
at Save the Children, Westport, Conn. Save the Children distributed
$16.8 million in food obtained under the federal grant program to
people in Ethiopia, Sudan and Lebanon in the fiscal year ending
June 30, says Andy Erish, information officer.
   Enough food is being shipped, or is on hand overseas, to
forestall trouble for Save the Children's programs until February,
she says.
   But Rudy von Bernuth, director of programs for CARE, in New York
City, says his agency may face ``very sharp reductions'' in the
number of people fed or the quantity of rations as early as
December.
   Individual rations might be reduced by up to 30 percent, says
George Wirt, director of public relations.
   CARE shipped more than 300,000 metric tons of grain to 11
countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa and reaching more than
20 million people, says Wirt.
   It is sadly ironic, von Bernuth says, that those who suffered in
the drought in Ethiopia and Sudan may have to suffer now because a
drought in the United States has pushed up prices of relief
commodities.
   The problem is more one of money supply than of food supply, the
officials say. Charities buy commodities with federal grants
administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development under
Title II of the Food for Peace Act.
   As the drought pushed prices up, the tonnage of commodities that
could be purchased by the various agencies has fallen.
   AID says, in a statement, that it is ``very concerned'' that
overall commodities prices may be up to 10 percent higher than
anticipated. The agency is waiting for estimates from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, expected in mid-August.
   A rule of thumb in measuring the possible impact of higher
prices is that every 10 percent increase could cause a 100,000
metric ton reduction in aid, says Owen Cylke, AID assisstant
administrator for food and voluntary assistance.
   However, he says, the law requires AID to make available 1.9
million metric tons of food in grant aid under Title II, and AID
will do so, even if it has to ask Congress for more money. Federal
funding for Title II in fiscal 1988, which ends Sept. 30, is $684
million. Proposed funding for fiscal 1989 is $595 million.
   ``It would be wonderful if Congress would consider additional
appropriations, but it seems unlikely,'' says von Bernuth.
   A member of the House Select Committee on Hunger, Rep. Byron L.
Dorgan, D.-S.D., disagrees.
   ``With 5 million people facing starvation in Ethiopia, Sudan and
other areas, it has to be a priority,'' he says.
   The outlook for food aid depends on whether recent rains in the
American farm belt fell in time to save growing crops.
   Kenneth Rozeboom, a commodities trader with Lackawanna Products
Corp., Clarence, N.Y., says soybean prices rose sharply during the
drought, but have fallen with the rain, and might even sink to
pre-drought levels.
   However, Rozeboom predicts ``corn prices will be higher by 20 to
25 percent than had the crop been as good as it could have been.''

<HEAD>Incidents, Articles Address Anti-Semitism Among Chicago Blacks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 25th graf, `Eugene Kennedy ...' to change editorial to
essay.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This city, long branded one of the nation's most
segregated, is also being labeled anti-Semitic as black leaders
come under fire for failing to challenge the strident and widely
publicized airing of simmering grievances against Jews.
   At the center of the controversy is former mayoral aide Steve
Cokely, who once claimed among other things that ``the AIDS
epidemic is a result of doctors, especially Jewish ones, who inject
AIDS into blacks.''
   Cokely's statements, made during lectures before he held his
City Hall post, did not gain widespread attention until the city's
newspapers published them in April.
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer dismissed Cokely five days later. The delay
dismayed Chicago's Jewish community, but some black leaders rallied
to Cokely's defense, saying his firing was outrageous and
symptomatic of the power Jews exert over blacks.
   Louis Farrakhan, who heads the Chicago-based Nation of Islam,
said Cokely's remarks offended Jewish leaders ``because the truth
hurts.'' Farrakhan, whose group claims 10,000 members, gained
attention with his own anti-Semitic stance in 1984, when he
supported Jesse Jackson's first presidential bid.
   Only a handful of prominent blacks have come forward to denounce
Farrakhan or Cokely.
   From others has come a silence that has aggravated tensions
between blacks and Jews and brought the city under scrutiny
recently in The New York Times and the New Republic and Chicago
magazines.
   ``What the Cokely incident really reveals is the unfortunate
divisions that have occurred in Chicago's black community since the
death of (Mayor) Harold Washington,'' said Clarence Page, a black
columnist and an editor of the Chicago Tribune.
   Washington, who had many Jewish allies, was the city's first
black mayor and fought a long battle against white aldermen for
control of the city's government.
   Sawyer, also black, was elected largely by anti-Washington
whites on the City Council after Washington died last year; he
hired Cokely as part of his struggle to gain black support.
   ``Anytime a community feels itself under siege and divided, its
leaders embrace their own, even when they are people they might
otherwise want to distance themselves from,'' Page said.
   ``This is one case where the community has behaved better than
its leaders.''
   He noted that when the Tribune polled voters after the Cokely
firing, only 8 percent of blacks said Cokely should have kept his
job.
   The traditional alliance between blacks and Jews, solidified
during the civil rights movement, has been strained by other
statements, incidents and divergent opinions in recent years.
   Among them are Jackson's ``Hymietown'' remark in referring to
New York during the 1984 campaign and Israel's continuing sale of
weapons to South Africa.
   ``Chicago is neither more anti-Semitic than any other city, nor
more anti-Semitic than in the past. In fact, the black community is
less anti-Semitic than its whites,'' Page said.
   Cokely himself has continued lecturing and did not respond to
telephone requests for an interview last week.
   On Thursday, an interracial group of ministers, rabbis and
civil-rights leaders that has been meeting informally since the
Cokely incident called for more dialogue and stronger leadership.
   ``Civic and political leaders must move quickly and forcefully
to denounce all expressions of anti-Semitism, racism and other
forms of bigotry to prevent them from gaining legitimacy,'' the
group's statement said.
   To promote understanding, the group announced a program of
speakers to appear in churches and synagogues and stress the
``historic ties'' between blacks and Jews.
   Chicago's Jewish community supported Washington in far greater
numbers than other white ethnics, and Washington reciprocated _
many of his top officials were Jewish. But Jews clearly have been
upset by the Cokely incident.
   Its impact likely was increased by other events. A Holocaust
memorial in suburban Skokie was defaced, and windows were smashed
at Jewish shops and synagogues here on the 49th anniversary of
``Crystal Night,'' when the Nazis carried out similar attacks in
Germany.
   ``Past cooperation is evidently no guarantee of present
understanding or future compassion,'' said Rabbi Robert Marx, a
member of the group.
   ``Do we speak for all Jews and all blacks? Of course not,'' he
said. ``There is much work to be done in both of our communities to
build bridges and remove fences.''
   Eugene Kennedy, a Loyola University psychology professor, argued
in an essay in Tuesday's New York Times that the Cokely affair has
brought about ``the ugliest experience that the city has suffered
in a long time.''
   He said some black politicians have shown a willingness to
exploit the Cokely incident ``to tap into what they identify as a
current of anti-Jewish feeling in their community.''
   ``There's no question about the fact that in the black community
here there are strong negative feelings towards many Jewish
people,'' said Lu Palmer, an influential local radio commentator
and self-described black nationalist.
   ``But whether Chicago is worse than anywhere else, I honestly
don't know. My suspicion is you wouldn't find much difference
wherever you went.''

   Pacific beachgoers have had to contend with
crud, tar balls, sharks and wildlife-killing plastic debris, but
they have not had to face the rats and syringes that have been
washing up on beaches in the East.
   ``We haven't had any trace of medical waste dumping. We have had
none of that, zero, since I have been chief the past 12 years,''
said Ralph Lopez, deputy of environmental health and health
facilities for the Los Angeles County Department of Health.
   ``The only beach pollution trouble we have is if we have a
breakdown in a power system or storm damage,'' he said.
   In densely populated California, millions of gallons of
untreated effluent have spilled into the sea in the past two years
because of equipment failures or rain-caused overflows at treatment
plants.
   Such accidents add to the hot debate over waste disposal, but
actual beach closures have been rare.
   A section of Laguna Beach in Orange County was closed for most
of last week when a pump broke, dumping 36,000 gallons of untreated
liquid waste. It was the latest in a series of spills, including
some last year from a sewage plant in Mexico that forced the
shutdown of miles of San Diego beaches.
   Further north, Santa Barbara County contends with tar and oil
from offshore wells and natural seepage. But recent years have seen
nothing like the spills of the 1960s that killed hundreds of fish
and birds.
   ``You can see the oil slick come in, a big long line of black
oil and tar,'' said Mark Bray, a lifeguard supervisor for the state.
   Hundreds of miles to the north, heavy rains cause untreated
sewage to spill at Ocean Beach in San Francisco about a dozen times
a year, and signs are posted warning against gathering shellfish,
which may have ingested bacteria.
   Meanwhile, the shark population is rising because of increasing
populations of protected sea lions and seals. Several fins have
been spotted recently, although no attacks were reported.
   A more persistent problem in the north is debris washing up _
including several barrels of toxic chemicals several years ago _
and litter left by visitors.
   Scenic Hawaii gets garbage dumped from large fishing boats, but
the islands' isolation and strong sea currents help protect its
beaches, according to Paul Aki, director of the state Health
Department's pollution control branch.
   ``Plus we are responsible for our own trash. We don't have a
neighboring state that can dump garbage that will wash ashore
here,'' Aki said.
   In the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, abandoned fishing nets have
trapped dozens of animals, and other garbage kills fur seals and
sea birds, said Brian Boyle, Washington commissioner of public
lands.
   ``Sea turtles will eat plastic bags thinking they're
jellyfish,'' he said.
   Oregon has problems with discarded plastics and aluminum cans,
but has avoided much East Coast-style pollution because garbage is
not dumped offshore and the state's population centers are mostly
inland, said Carolyn Young, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Department
of Environmental Quality.
   ``We do have driftwood washing up from logging operations
occasionally,'' she said.

   Movie stars may hit the trendy, high-priced
stores on Rodeo Drive when they're in Beverly Hills, but when
they're making a movie on location they shop at Wal-Mart like
everyone else.
   Bruce Willis and Emily Lloyd star in ``In Country,'' being
filmed in western Kentucky. Ms. Lloyd plays Samantha, a 17-year-old
who lives with her Uncle Emmett, played by Willis.
   Other shoppers didn't bother Willis and his wife, actress Demi
Moore, when they were in Wal-Mart, said Assistant Manager Cliff
Brumley.
   ``I think it is to the credit of the people of Paducah that they
didn't harass them or bother them in any way,'' Brumley said.
   Willis and Ms. Moore also have become patrons of Cardinal Lanes,
showing up about every other day with friends and bodyguards, and
have bought bowling balls and shoes, said manager Byrl Gast.
   They had nicknames inscribed on the balls, ``Duke'' for Willis
and ``Bunny'' for Ms. Moore, she said.

   ``If you don't love people, don't go into
politics,'' Barry Goldwater says in his forthcoming autobiography,
but he also bares his teeth in biting comment.
   Although he counts President Reagan a friend who has fought for
the conservative cause, he also raps Reagan over the Iranian arms
sale.
   He says he believes Reagan knew of the diversion of Iranian
funds to the Contras. ``He had to know,'' Goldwater wrote. ``The
White House explanation makes him out to be either a liar or an
incompetent.''
   Excerpts from his book, written with former newspaper political
columnist Jack Casserly, appear in the September issue of Playboy
magazine. The book is to be released next month.
   He characterizes President Lyndon Johnson as ``a master of
manipulation'' who ``solved tough public issues through private
plotting.''
   Goldwater also recalls a dinner with President Nixon at the
height of the Watergate scandal. Nixon was rambling, erratic and
incoherent, he writes.
   Goldwater says he called one of the guests, Bryce Harlow, the
next day and asked about Nixon's behavior. Harlow ``said that Nixon
was drunk before and during dinner,'' Goldwater writes.

Appellate Court to dismiss a delicatessen owner's lawsuit against
him.
   A new trial in the case is set for November on Westport Deli
owner Julius Gold's suit claiming Newman and others reneged on a
promise to grant him an 8 percent share in Newman's Own Inc., which
has marketed salad dressing, popcorn, spaghetti sauce and lemonade
and donates revenues to charity.
   Newman's lawyers argue in the appeal filed Friday that
insufficient evidence was produced during the first trial, which

   Eddie Murphy has taken out a three-page
advertisement in a Brooklyn newspaper to respond to criticism that
his new movie makes fun of black life, the weekly says.
   The City Sun published a column by Armond White in its July 6
issue that said ``Coming to America,'' about an African prince who
comes to New York seeking a wife, was full of ``ethnic
self-loathing and humiliation.''
   ``The film is simply making fun of black life,'' White wrote.
   The tabloid, which has a largely black readership, released
excerpts Friday of Murphy's response, which will appear in the
paper's Aug. 3 issue.
   Among other things, Murphy, citing the movie's box-office
success, said ``the reason large numbers of blacks have accepted
the movie is that it urges them to bring the hidden and forgotten
African part of us in touch with our American experience.''

   Actress Jane Fonda has taken another
step in her fence-mending with Vietnam veterans, posing for
snapshots at a fund-raiser for children who suffered birth defects
believed linked to Agent Orange.
   Some veterans groups protested loudly when they learned earlier
this year that Fonda, who visited North Vietnam during the Vietnam
War, planned to film part of a movie in Waterbury and in Holyoke,
Mass.
   Last month, she apologized in a nationally televised interview
for anything that may have hurt Vietnam veterans, but in her
appearance Friday she just talked about the effects veterans say
Agent Orange has caused.
   ``This event is a little bit like a dream come true,'' she said.
   Robert DeNiro, who co-stars in the movie ``Stanley and Iris,''
also attended. ``A lot of people came back from Vietnam and are
suffering. That was bad enough, but when the children suffer what
could be worse?'' he said.

<HEAD>Muscovites to Get Theme Park on Banks of Moscow River, Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There may not be a Russian-speaking Mickey Mouse
on hand for the grand opening, but a newspaper reported Saturday
that Moscow should have its own Disneyland-style theme park, called
Wonderland, by 1997.
   Moskovsky Komsomolets, the capital's youth daily, said a plan
has been tentatively approved to build the park on 890 acres on the
banks of the Moscow River.
   The paper said the park, which it dubbed a ``Muscovite
Disneyland,'' would help solve what it called one of Moscow's
biggest problems _ the lack of things to do.
   ``There's simply no place for people to go,'' Moskovsky
Komsomolets said. ``Children's parks that were created in the 1930s
just don't satisfy Muscovites anymore with their poor-quality
attractions.''
   According to the report, the park's center would be called the
Magic City, and it would combine a fairy-tale Russian city, a
medieval castle and an Oriental city.
   The Soviet filmmakers' union has already volunteered to build
the Magic City, which it wants to be able to use as a movie set,
Moskovsky Komsomolets said.
   Under the Magic City, visitors will enter a subterranean
``kingdom of the shadows,'' inhabited by spirits, vampires, devils
and other supernatural beings, the paper said.
   Other proposed attractions include an Underwater City, a City of
the Future, a City of Sport, and a zoo where the animals would roam
free and the people would be kept behind bars.
   A monorail able to whisk passengers along at 173 mph is proposed
to link the park to other locations in western Moscow, the paper
said.
   Contruction is planned to begin next summer, with the park
opening in 1997, it said. The paper said some of the country's best
scientists and artists would be asked to help design Wonderland and
its attractions.

   Jorge Diaz Serrano, former head of the
government oil monopoly, was freed from prison today after serving
five years of a 10-year sentence for fraud.
   Diaz Serrano, an ex-senator, left the Southern Penitentiary
accompanied by his wife and two sons and maintaining his innocence,
as he has throughout the highly publicized case. ``I am returning
to freedom, but not because there has been justice,'' he told
reporters.
   A circuit court in March reduced his sentence to five years,
saying Diaz Serrano was not dangerous. The Supreme Court upheld the
reduction on July 18.
   The cases of Diaz Serrano and former Mexico City police chief
Arturo Durazo Moreno were centerpieces of President Miguel de la
Madrid's ``moral renovation'' campaign in the early 1980s.
   Diaz Serrano was convicted in 1983 of defrauding the state oil
company Pemex of $34 million through the purchase of two natural
gas tankers. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined the
equivalent of $58 million.
   Diaz Serrano headed Pemex from 1976 to 1981, the oil boom years
of former President Jose Lopez Portillo. After leaving Pemex, Diaz
Serrano was elected senator from the northern state of Sonora.
Under the de la Madrid administration, Congress stripped him from
his immunity from prosecution.
   His lawyer, Enrique Mendoza Morales, said Diaz Serrano doesn't
have the money to pay the $58 million fine, but under Mexican law,
cannot be held in prison because of his inability to pay.
   Mendoza Morales said the government has confiscated about a $1
million in assets from Diaz Serrano, including property in the
resort cities of Cuernavaca and Acapulco and an art collection.
   The case of Durazo Moreno, accused of extortion and illegal arms
possession, is still pending.

   The summer of '88 is already over in the minds
of countless Northeastern beach lovers revolted by a tide of dead
rats, syringes and sewage that has left miles of shoreline deserted
and seaside businesses shuttered even on the hottest days.
   ``They finally did it _ they ruined the beach,'' said Joe
Lovecchi of Brooklyn. He will limit his ocean dips to ``ankles only
for the rest of the season.''
   Others are not so brave. Attendance has plummeted at Atlantic
beaches since the scare began July 6, when needles and vials of
blood, some of which tested positive for the AIDS virus, began
washing up along Long Island's 120-mile southern shore.
   Since then, on beaches from New Jersey to Massachusetts,
lifeguards and rangers with rakes and rubber gloves have harvested
gruesome garbage after nearly every high tide.
   ``Whoever did this is the Typhoid Mary of garbage carters,''
said New York City Parks Commissioner Henry Stern. ``This has
ruined the summer for millions of people.''
   Although health officials say chances of contracting AIDS from
ocean-borne waste are almost nil, in New York officials are playing
it safe. When needles are found, the beach is closed for at least
two relatively ``clean'' high tides.
   Rhode Island beaches remained open after syringes, catheter and
colostomy bags and intravenous tubing washed up last week;
scientists doing computer studies of ocean currents said the waste
was probably dumped near New York in June.
   Medical waste is not the only reason beaches have closed.
Beaches around Asbury Park, N.J., were closed because of
contamination from human waste, which is a more potent threat to
public health than hospital waste.
   As in past summers, high levels of fecal coliform bacteria also
have forced beaches to close on Long Island and around Boston
harbor.
   John Rafferty, a New York City lifeguard, said he will enter the
water only when his job requires it.
   ``I'm not afraid of AIDS. It's just dirty water. The water's
been dirty for years. I don't enjoy swimming in it,'' he said.
``You come out and you don't feel refreshed.''
   Lovecchi has taken the same position. ``Why take a chance? It's
not just AIDS, but hepatitis, a host of things,'' he said. ``If
they opened up a stand selling Clorox, they could sell out to
people who want to wash their feet.''
   Bleach might sell, but hot dogs and beers are not in demand at
deserted beaches.
   ``It's real bad,'' said Wayne Horner, who operates the food
concession at Jacob Riis Park in Queens, where attendance is down
from a million last July to 457,000 this month. Horner said sales
are down by two-thirds. ``Nobody's coming out and there's nothing
we can do.''
   Fear and confusion did not prevent Loli Reyna of Queens from
taking her two young children to the beach last week.
   ``If they get scared of the ocean now, they're never going to go
in again,'' she said. ``Nobody gets AIDS at the beach. You use
drugs and needles, you get AIDS.''
   Problems with sewage plants also have contributed to the beach
crisis. An old sewage plant in Asbury Park overflowed and dumped
waste into the ocean; the nearby town of Bradley Beach is now
threatening to sue Asbury Park for lost business.
   Heavy rains are being blamed for drowning dozens of sewer rats
that washed ashore in New York. While they have determined that the
rats didn't come from a lab, officials haven't pinpointed the
source of the medical garbage.
   ``It's real possible all the material came from the same
source,'' said New York City Sanitation Commissioner Brendan
Sexton. ``There are particular outlets and people we are watching.''
   Among lifeguards, who frequently outnumbered sunbathers last
week, there was an almost fatalistic consensus: Tidal debris is not
new and garbage of all kinds will continue to wash ashore as long
as offshore dumping continues.
   ``Things have been washing up for a long time, but AIDS is
scaring people so much they are blowing it out of proportion,''
said lifeguard George Triffon.

   The Chicago & North Western Transportation Co.
and its brakemen say it may take an act of Congress to avert a
strike that would idle Farm Belt boxcars and strand thousands of
commuters.
   Lawmakers are considering legislation to keep the trains rolling.
   The United Transportation Union said it will strike Thursday if
C&NW adopts new work rules eliminating jobs for 1,156 UTU brakemen.
   However, neither side can act until a cooling-off period ordered
by President Reagan ends at 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 4.
   In his order, which also blocked an April walkout and created an
emergency board to intervene, Reagan said a strike against C&NW
could deprive several Midwestern states of essential rail service _
and disrupt business in the Chicago area, where 40,000 commuters
use its trains daily.
   Negotiators for the company and Cleveland-based union met last
Monday and Tuesday at National Mediation Board headquarters in
Washington but made no progress. As of Friday, no further talks
were scheduled.
   ``For almost two years, we've been planning how we would operate
in the event of a strike,'' said James Foote, vice president of
communications for CNW Corp. in Chicago, the railroad's parent
company. ``We're ready.''
   ``They didn't get what they wanted, so they don't intend to talk
and intend to promulgate all the things they wanted on Aug. 4,''
UTU President Fred Hardin said. ``If they take that position, that
leaves us no alternative but to peacefully withdraw from service.''
   On July 1, the presidential emergency board proposed a
compromise: that C&NW eliminate one brakeman per train and the
other if approved by an arbitrator on a train-by-train basis. Both
sides rejected the plan.
   The railroad operates on 6,400 miles of track with 8,000
employees in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
   It ranks eighth among U.S. railroads in revenue, generating
$893.5 million last year by moving 1.7 million carloads of freight.
   ``We've cut our work force, cut expenses and improved our
productivity dramatically,'' Foote said. ``But because of
competition and lower rates, our revenue per car has declined 26
percent since 1982.''
   C&NW wants to save $51 million a year by cutting most of its
train crews from four to two people, eliminating what it considers
unnecessary brakemen's jobs and leaving an engineer and conductor
on board.
   ``We've made agreements in good faith with all the other
carriers since the 1970s to cut down to one conductor and one
brakeman on each crew and negotiate for the other brakeman,'' said
Hardin, whose union represents both brakemen and conductors. ``If
C&NW were to win _ we have a strike and they're victorious _ then
they'd have an unfair advantage over the other railroads.''
   Foote said it might take an act of Congress to bring a
settlement, a sentiment echoed by Hardin, but neither the company
nor union want a solution being proposed on Capitol Hill. They have
spent the last few days lobbying against it.
   A bill introduced by Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., would make the
presidential board's recommendations binding unless the parties
reach agreement without a strike.
   The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's
transportation subcommittee, Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, said the
measure would get prompt attention if there is no settlement by
Thursday.
   ``This would be a crippling strike for commuters and many
agricultural interests, especially in these drought-stricken
times,'' Luken said. ``It's premature for us to consider any action
unless and until there would be a strike, but we intend to be in a
position to move very quickly.''
   Hardin said he was not sure yet if the UTU would extend a strike
to other carriers, and he did not know if C&NW employees from 15
other unions would walk off the job in sympathy.
   ``If it's a legal strike, our people would,'' said Jim Shell,
vice president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in
Cleveland. ``That's a matter of personal choice, whether a member
crosses their picket lines or not, but this organization
traditionally has honored legal strikes.''

<HEAD>Northwest Lumber Strike Could Last Into Fall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A strike by 9,000 Northwest lumber workers
has silenced dozens of logging operations and sawmills in five
states and could last into the fall, union and company officials
say.
   Monday marks the eighth week of the strike, with no settlement
in sight and the continuing threat that thousands more may join the
walkout.
   Workers are demanding restoration of wages and benefits cut two
years ago, when the companies were struggling to get out of an
industry-wide recession. The unions reluctantly accepted cuts after
losing a series of strikes.
   Union leaders say their members deserve to share in record
profits many of the companies have posted in the past two years.
Company officials say they cannot restore wages and still compete
with smaller, non-union mills.
   ``We went from an industry dominated by national companies with
branches in Oregon, to plant closures and mills bought and
re-opened by small independents,'' said Cathy Baldwin, Willamette
Industries Inc., a Portland-based manufacturer of paper and wood
products.
   ``These people opened these facilities with non-union labor
paying substantially lower wages than we do. We're in a position
now of competing with these smaller independents that have a
substantial advantage over us in labor costs.''
   Eight wood-products companies, including some of the region's
largest, have been struck in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and
Northern California since contracts expired May 31.
   The large companies, which used to bargain as a group, have
decided to bargain separately, and union officials say each company
wants to stonewall until they see what their competitors do.
   ``There will always be strikes in this industry until they can
get their act together,'' said Bill Hubbell, president of the
International Woodworkers of America-U.S., one of the striking
unions.
   Company officials say that while profits have been up, most of
those earnings have come from paper products, not wood products.
Baldwin said Willamette's plywood prices have dropped 17 percent
since 1986, while the cost of logs has nearly doubled.
   Several companies have offered bonuses tied to productivity
increases. They argue that bonuses give them more flexibility in a
cyclical industry.
   The unions say their members are asking just to make what they
earned in 1985. The industry's average starting wage in 1985 was
$10.75 an hour. Today it's $9.18, said Brad Witt, a spokesman for
the other striking union, the Western Council of Industrial Workers.
   As the strike has dragged on, however, the unions have offered
to consider a combination of bonuses and wage increases.
   The unions have targeted six large companies: Willamette, Boise
Cascade Corp., Champion International Corp., Simpson Timber Co.,
DAW Forest Products Inc., and WI Forest Products Inc. The Western
Council also has struck two smaller companies, Lakeview Lumber Co.
and a door plant operated by Morgan Products Ltd.
   The unions have threatened to strike Weyerhaeuser Co., the
region's largest wood-products company with 6,000 union workers in
Oregon and Washington, but aren't ready to move yet.
   ``Keeping Weyerhaeuser running has an effect of the same
strategy of the automobile unions when they strike only one company
at a time,'' Hubbell said. ``They take Ford out and the others
work, and pretty soon Ford gets upset with their customers buying
Chrysler or General Motors products.''
   The strike has reduced production by 7.5 percent, but there have
been no shortages, said Malcolm Epley, vice president of the
Western Wood Products Association, a Portland-based industry group.
   ``We're not really feeling any problems because demand has been
off, the market's been soft,'' Epley said. The situation might
change if more workers go out, he said.

   Drug questions dominate a bitter contest for an
Atlanta congressonal seat, with the incumbent admitting he
considered using laundered drug money to finance his home and a
challenger saying he might consider legalizing drugs.
   Rep. Pat Swindall, a two-term Republican whose philosophy is
largely in tune with that of the religious right, is unopposed in
his party's Aug. 9 primary.
   The front-runner in a three-way Democratic contest for the seat
in the affluent 4th District is widely considered to be Ben Jones,
who played mechanic Cooter on the ``Dukes of Hazzard.'' He took 47
percent of the vote against Swindall in a 1986 challenge.
   Jones has acknowledged telling a Young Democrats meeting at the
University of Georgia in May that he might consider legalizing
drugs. But he added that he told the group that would be an option
``only after a massive effort to truly eradicate drugs.''
   Jones has complained that his views have been distorted, and his
campaign ads stress his opposition to drugs.
   One of his opponents, lawyer Nick Moraitakis, who has been
campaigning for more than a year, said the remark was ``irrational,
irresponsible and ridiculous.''
   John Stembler, a theater operator and last-minute entry in the
Democratic race, said he intended to hit the drug question hard in
TV ads before the primary.
   Jones said he doesn't think the charge that he is soft on drugs
will hurt his chances. ``The truth always comes out and I think
this tactic backfires,'' he said.
   Swindall, 37, an Atlanta lawyer and businessman, won the
congressional seat in 1984 by defeating Democratic Rep. Elliott
Levitas. The election turned, in part, on Swindall's charge that
the incumbent talked a conservative game at home but voted with the
liberals in Washington.
   In office, Swindall has stressed his ties with his church and
frequently sided with the religious right on issues such as
abortion.
   But a 12,500-square-foot, $1 million house he built has cast
dark clouds over his political career.
   First, there was bad publicity about liens filed against the
property for unpaid bills. Swindall said the money should have been
paid by the contractor.
   Then, an Atlanta businessman with whom he discussed a mortgage
loan was indicted by a federal grand jury on money-laundering
charges.
   Swindall was called to testify before the grand jury in February
and told reporters at the time he returned a $150,000 check from
the businessman, Charles LeChasney, because he was concerned that
LeChasney and another man _ later identified as an undercover
Internal Revenue Service agent _ were trying to use him to launder
money.
   However, a government videotape, the contents of which were
obtained by reporters, showed Swindall continued pursuing an
$850,000 loan, even after being told it might be financed with drug
money, until he was informed by the undercover agent that a
go-between could not be used and that Swindall would have to accept
the proceeds in person and sign a receipt.
   The congressman told supporters he was ``embarrassed and
ashamed'' of dealing with the men, but that he did not violate the
law because he ultimately did not take the money.
   ``I entertained things that were illegal and I entertained
things that were wrong,'' he said in June. ``But I thank God I
rejected (the loan).''
   Jones, 47, said he isn't focusing on Swindall's problems.
   ``I'm just going to keep on doing what I've been doing _ talking
about the issues, the differences between he and I and trying to
take the highest road possible. ... His other problems are simply
there and I don't intend to talk about them,'' Jones said.
   Swindall's campaign consultant, Robb Austin, said the loan
consideration will be a factor in the election but added, ``This is
a conservative district and Pat, without question, has represented
the views in the district.''

   Burmese authorities have arrested up to
25 people, including a prominent critic of the authoritarian
government and an Associated Press correspondent, U.S. officials
and other diplomats said Saturday.
   The arrests came less than a week after Sein Lwin, a former army
general known for ruthless suppression of dissidents, replaced Ne
Win as president and chairman of Burma's sole political party.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said U.S.
officials in Burma ``understand that perhaps as many as 25 people
have been arrested within the last 24 hours.''
   She said those arrested included retired brigadier general Aung
Gyi, a long-time critic of Ne Win's authoritarian regime.
   Ms. Beck and Western diplomats in Burma said AP correspondent
Sein Win was also among the arrested.
   In a brief message telexed to the Associated Press bureau in
Bangkok, the journalist's family said: ``Daddy has been taken away.
He won't be available to answer your queries.'' The message was
received at 12:58 a.m.
   The 70-year-old Aung Gyi, once regarded as a probable successor
to Ne Win, had written a series of letters attacking economic and
political conditions in Burma. He had targeted Sein Lwin,
criticizing his role in the bloody suppression of student protests.
   Analysts in Burma had predicted Aung Gyi would be silenced in a
society where public dissent has been stamped out swiftly in the
past.
   The 66-year-old correspondent, formerly publisher of the
English-language daily The Guardian, was jailed for three years in
Burma in the 1960s in connection with his journalistic activities.
He joined The Associated Press shortly after his release in 1968.
   In 1963, he was awarded the Golden Pen of Freedom by the
Paris-based International Federation of Journalists for his work in
fostering a free press in Burma. He also served on the executive
board of the International Press Institute and founded Burma's
first national news agency.
   Aung Gyi, a former military colleague of Ne Win, sided with the
former leader during the 1962 military coup that overthrew the
civilian government. He then served as vice chairman of Burma's
Revolutionary Council and Minister for Trade Development and
Industries.
   But the pragmatic, liberal Aung Gyi quarreled with Ne Win's more
radically socialist supporters over plans to nationalize the
economy. He resigned from his positions in 1963 and was
subsequently jailed.
   An owner of several tea and pastry shops in Rangoon, the Burmese
capital, Aung Gyi recently reemerged in the public eye through his
letters. Although addressed to Ne Win and other Burmese leaders,
the letters were widely circulated in Rangoon and _ according to
one Burmese source _ ``sold like hotcakes.''
   Addressing Ne Win as ``bogyoke,'' or general, Aung Gyi refrained
from attacking his former superior personally. But he sharply
criticized those around Ne Win as well as the general state of the
country.
   ``That the country has gone from bad to worse (26) years after
the seizure of power is evident to anyone not living in a fool's
paradise,'' Aung Gyi wrote in a letter May 12. ``The country has
plunged to the bottom politically, economically and socially. The
moral decay is the most deplorable.''
   Letters dated June 8 and July 19 attacked Sein Lwin for
``turning a blind eye'' to ``all kinds of human rights violations.''
   The new leader is widely believed to have commanded forces that
brutally supressed student demonstrations in the capital in March.
   Aung Gyi, giving gruesome detail of rapes and beatings, claimed
that 283 people died. The government has acknowledged 43 deaths,
including 41 who suffocated in a crowded police van after their
arrests.
   Aung Gyi was sharply criticized at a party congress last week
where Ne Win offered his resignation after 26 years in power. Ne
Win cited the unrest as one reason for steppig down.
   About a third of his speech was devoted to detailed allegations
that Aung Gyi blew up the Student Union Building at Rangoon
University during a 1962 protest.
   Western sources have said Ne Win himself ordered the building
destroyed during the protest, in which troops commanded by Sein
Lwin gunned down 22 protesters.
   Following unrest in the capital in June that spread to other
Burmese cities and towns, the government closed virtually all
universities and other academic institutions. They are scheduled to
reopen next month.

   A private human rights organization stepped up
criticism of the Reagan administration on Saturday, saying it has
failed to raise with Chinese authorities questions of torture,
political arrests and other human rights abuses in Tibet.
   President Reagan's ``decision not to speak up on the subject of
Tibet when he met with China's foreign minister in March, just
after the renewed violence in Lhasa (Tibet) is indefensible,'' Asia
Watch said in its second report on the issue in half a year.
   Washington's silence ``has enabled the government of China to
maintain policies in Tibetan areas ... that go against the grain of
prevailing American sentiment on internationally-recognized human
rights and against the provisions of U.S. laws that embody those
sentiments,'' the report said.
   ``U.S. government inaction, combined with China's decision to
bar, with a few scattered exceptions, the international media and
concerned observers from Tibet, has contributed to the creation of
a climate in which the abuse of rights can proceed with little
regard for international opinion, international norms or ...
international obligations which China has accepted.''
   The State Department said it had not seen the Asia Watch report
and would not comment.
   The United States recognizes Tibet, in a remote Himalayan border
region, as part of China. Asia Watch said it takes no stand on the
issue of independence for Tibet.
   When Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian visited Washington last
March, ``the only real problem that the administration seems to
have perceived in Sino-American relations ... was China's position
in the Persian Gulf War, including its sales of Silkworm missiles
to Iran,'' Asia Watch said.
   An apparent decision not to take up the Tibetan issue with Wu
was ``particularly unfortunate,'' it said, because Wu visited
shortly after March riots in Tibet that were ``far more serious
than the fall disturbances in the Tibetan capital, which had at
least managed to elicit some concerned comment from the
administration ...
   ``The evidence strongly indicates that human rights conditions
in Tibet have deteriorated since last fall; government brutality in
the March violence seems to have exceeded the level of violence
during the fall; the number of arrests seems to be higher; the
torture in prison continues.''
   The report noted that when Chinese Vice Premier Tian Jiyun
visited the White House and State Department last May, again there
was ``no indication that the administration made any attempt to
broach the Tibetan issue.''
   Asia Watch quoted reports from various sources that as many as
50 people died after daylong rioting involving up to 10,000
Tibetans in street battles with security forces on March 5, the
last day of a Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., co-chairman of the Congressional
Human Rights Caucus, said the report confirmed information the
caucus has been receiving since the unrest began last year in Tibet.
   Improved U.S.-Chinese relations, while in the interest of both
countries, cannot occur ``in the face of continued Chinese
violations of Tibetan human rights,'' Lantos said.
   ``The Chinese authorities must understand that just as the
American people have insisted on the observance of human rights by
the Soviet Union as a condition of improved U.S.-Soviet relations,
so Chinese observance of Tibetan human rights is a precondition for
further improvement in U.S.-China relations.''

   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address, delivered from Camp David, Md.:
   My fellow Americans, what a moment of hope it was one year ago
when Central American leaders concluded their meeting in Guatemala.
   A Sandinista government of Nicaragua, a communist regime,
fighting a civil war against 15,000 Nicaraguan freedom fighters
opposed to their oppression, agreed to a series of sweeping
democratic reforms. If carried out, those reforms would have ended
the killing and brought peace to Nicaragua and Central America. It
would also have meant that Nicaragua would have last joined the
family of free democratic nations.
   At first, there were a few hopeful signs to much media fanfare:
the opposition newspaper in Nicaragua, La Prensa, was reopened;
independent radio stations were allowed to broadcast again; a few
political prisoners were released, and political groups were
allowed more latitude. Most important, Sandinistas finally agreed
to the freedom fighters' request for direct negotiations for a
peaceful democratic settlement.
   Now, the main reason the Sandinistas agreed to those steps a
year ago was the steady progress of the freedom fighters including
important battlefield victories like the one at Los Minos. But
tragically, t the very moment when continued strength and
determination by the United States might have meant the continued
success of the peace plan, the United States House of
Representatives decided, and by only a very narrow margin, to
refuse my request for further effective aid to the freedom fighters.
   This, of course, removed the principal prod _ the military
victories and popular success of the freedom fighters to Sandinista
participation in the peace plan _ and sent an immediate signal of
American weakness to the communists.
   This failure to support the freedom fighters has had costly and
sad consequences _ just how costly and sad we've seen during the
past few weeks. Communist Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega has been
visiting Castro in Cuba and voicing solidarity with the tyrant who
has brought so much sadness and misery to that country. While in
Nicaragua, a renewed attack on political descent is being led by
the head of the secret police, Tomas Borge, a dedicated communist
and grim, hardened repressor of human rights whose office,
according to our Commission on Organized Crime, has also been
actively engaged in the international drug trade.
   Acting under the orders of the communist leaders and Borge's
supervision, Sandinista police and goon squads have brutally broken
up a peaceful demonstration by 3,000 Nicaraguans. Opposition
leaders were jailed or beaten and now sentenced to prison.
Political religious liberties have again been curtailed. The
communists ordered the Catholic archbishop to shut down the
Catholic radio station. And for almost two weeks, the independent
newspaper, La Prensa, was refused permission to publish and the
American Ambassador was expelled. And yet, while the cutoff of aid
to the freedom fighters was a dreadful mistake, getting the cause
of peace and freedom back on track, not recrimination, must now be
our goal.
   There is a chance for a real bipartisan consensus in support of
renewed Contra aid. Indeed, one of its strong supporters has
recently been named to be the vice presidential candidate of the
Democratic party.
   Senator Bob Dole intends soon to offer legislation to renew
effective assistance to the freedom fighters. The final details are
being worked out, and I urge the members of the Senate to support
the aid package and I also asked the House of Representatives to
move speedily and favorably on the Senate legislation.
   Meanwhile, we continue to pursue aggressively our diplomatic
efforts with the Central American democracies. So much is at stake.
   A few years ago, there were those who said the cause of freedom
and democracy was lost in El Salvador. Well, perhaps some of you
remember that incredible scene when the people of that country
defied communist threats and bullets to march to the polls and vote
for democracy. The American aid package that helped make democracy
victorious in El Salvador passed by only two votes in the House,
but pass it did and democracy did come.
   A few weeks ago, both Vice President Bush and I visited the
bedside of one of the heroes of that struggle _ President Duarte of
El Salvador. President Duarte's had no easy life. He has been
continually threatened by extremists of both left and right. His
daughter was kidnapped by communist guerrillas.
   And now, while in a desperate struggle with cancer, he continues
to lead his nation on the high road to democracy. And I cannot tell
you how deeply moved Vice President Bush and I were by our visit to
this brave and remarkable man. And how determined we both were that
his dream for his people and all the peoples of Central America
should be made a reality _ the dream of peace and freedom for every
man, woman, and child.
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

   Technicians stopped a hydrogen leak
and fixed a balky oxygen pump Saturday and NASA said it would
resume a countdown on Sunday leading to the test-firing of space
shuttle Discovery's main engines.
   A countdown leading to the critical test was halted early Friday
when the problems developed, and the firing was postponed three
days, from Monday until Thursday.
   Officials believe the engine test delays, combined with an
unresolved leak in Discovery's steering thruster system, will slip
Discovery's launch date from mid-September into October.
   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone reported Saturday that technicians
traced the hydrogen leak to a nut on a pressure monitor hose,
repaired it and detected no further leakage. She said the pump
problem was caused by two corroded control switches that were
replaced.
   She said tests would continue to verify the changes and that the
launch team planned on Sunday to resume a countdown demonstration
test in which Discovery's huge external fuel tank will be loaded
with half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.
   That count is to continue until 7 a.m. Monday when a mock
liftoff will be scrubbed with 10 seconds to go because of a
simulated problem. The launch team then will empty the tank,
restart the count and refill the tank, leading to the 20-second
ignition of the three main engines Thursday.
   The filling of the tank had barely begun when the troubles with
the hydrogen and oxygen systems cropped up Friday. Both are in
ground support equipment and not on the shuttle itself.
   The postponement was the fourth for the test-firing in 10 days.
   The firing is to check several modifications made to the shuttle
engines and is considered essential for certifying Discovery for
the first shuttle launch since the loss of Challenger and its
seven-member crew in an explosion on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Engineers have come up with a scheme for getting access to the
steering system leak on the launch pad by cutting a hole through
the aft bulkhead of the shuttle's cargo bay. That would delay the
launch an additional two weeks.
   Another option, to be made after the test-firing, is to take
Discovery off the pad and back to a hangar for repair, a move that
could put off the launch until November.

<HEAD>Racist Remarks Again Touch Off Debate in Japan</HEAD>

   A senior politician's insulting remarks about
American blacks have once again touched off debate over racist
sentiments in this country.
   Michio Watanabe, policy chief of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, suggested that American blacks frequently use
credit cards but care little about paying their bills.
   ``Among those guys over there (America) are a lot of blacks and
so on who would think without concern, `We're bankrupt. Now we
don't have to pay anything back,'' Watanabe said July 23 to party
members.
   The senior politician is widely believed to aspire to the
premiership.
   Watanabe made the comments at a time when Japanese advertising
for consumer goods often portrays blacks only as sexy dancers and
good athletes, suggesting a widespread patronizing attitude.
   The U.S. Embassy said it ``deplored any disparaging comment
that, consciously or unconsciously, uses demeaning stereotypes of
any American to make a point.''
   Watanabe apologized, saying two days later that he regretted his
``misleading and inadvertent'' comments.
   The Sogo Department Store in Tokyo also drew fire recently for
displaying men's clothing on two black mannequins in dance poses
with crossed eyes and huge red lips.
   ``There was absolutely no intention of creating any racist
display,'' said the store's deputy manager, Hideo Kinoshita. ``To
us, they were lively and energetic. We just put suits on them in
what we thought was a tasteful display.''
   The store dismantled the mannequins after two weeks, as planned,
and does not intend to put up other such displays in the near
future, Kinoshita said.
   Sanrio, a major gift manufacturer, had sold since 1985 a pair of
black dolls named Sambo and Hanna. The company also markets
Bibinba, a wide-eyed black doll with a red-lipped grin.
   ``There were no racist sentiments behind them,'' said Sanrio
spokesman Kazuo Tomatsu. ``Our corporate policy is to promote love
and friendship, but some people found these products offensive, so
we have canceled their production.''
   The move will cost Sanrio about $11.5 million, Tomatsu said.
Sanrio's annual sales are $615 million.
   Takara, Japan's No. 2 toymaker, also makes Dakko-chan, an
inflatable black doll with big eyes and red lips. It was Japan's
top-selling toy when introduced in 1960, so Takara made it its
corporate logo. Japanese still buy 100,000 of them a year.
   ``We didn't consider it a black person, it was just a cute
doll,'' says Takara spokesman Shusuke Kubota. ``Black was popular
then, and at that time Harry Belafonte's `Banana Boat Song' was a
big hit.'' He said the firm had received no complaints.
   The Japanese Embassy in Washington reported receiving several
phone calls of protest after photos of the mannequins and reports
of Watanabe's comments were published in the United States.
   Watanabe's apology was the second he made to a foreign country.
In February, he told China he was sorry for saying that people in
remote Shanxi province ``have dug themselves into pits and are
still living there.''
   Watanabe's gaffe recalls former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's remark in 1986 that the U.S. intellectual level was low
because of the large numbers of blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans.
   Many Japanese were shocked at the negative international
response to Nakasone's remarks.
   A typical response was, ``It's true, what's the problem with
saying it?'' But Nakasone subsequently issued an apology to the
American people.
   Earlier this year, Seisuke Okuno was fired from his Cabinet post
as director general of the National Land Agency for saying Japan
was not an aggressor in World War II, but ``fought to protect
itself at a time when the white race had turned Asia into a
colony.''
   Kuniko Inoguchi, professor of international relations at Tokyo's
Sophia University, says the Japanese may have felt ``submissive''
at the time, since most of the American troops occupying Japan
after World War II were white.
   ``But in terms of fashion, blacks are `in' and stylish in
Japan,'' Miss Inoguchi said. ``It's similar to how Japanese were
once stereotyped by Americans _ buck-toothed, with glasses and
slanted eyes. Most Japanese simply lack awareness of black
identity.''
   The Japanese fashion of blacks as stereotypes was reinforced
last year after the popularity of a book by Eimi Yamada, ``For Soul
Music Lovers Only,'' which won a prestigious literary prize.
   Japanese companies have regularly used black athletes _
including Ben Johnson, Carl Lewis and Mike Tyson _ to endorse
products, and several professional baseball teams have signed up
black players.
   But Japan has only reluctantly admitted outsiders.
   To the Japanese, anyone who is not Japanese is a ``gaijin,'' or
foreigner. The word means more than just outsider _ it means ``not
Japanese,'' a taunt Japanese schoolchildren can throw at anyone who
does not belong.
   Many Japanese politicians, including Nakasone, claim that Japan
is a homogenous race, undiluted by mixing with outsiders, and pride
themselves on that fact without realizing its racist implications.
   The newspaper Asahi Shimbun called this a misguided belief.
   ``Almost all countries of the world have some sort of minority
problem, and are trying to resolve them through trial and error. In
sharp contrast, Japan is embarrassingly warped in its attitude to
this issue,'' the paper said in an editorial.

<HEAD>West Germany Topped U.S. Exports Again in 1987</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany outdistanced the United States as
the world's biggest exporter for the second year in a row,
according to the International Monetary Fund.
   West German exports amounted to $294 billion, compared with $250
billion for the United States and $231 billion for Japan in 1987,
the IMF said.
   West German exports, which first jumped ahead of U.S. exports in
1986, also ran ahead of U.S. exports for the first two months of
1988: $46.7 billion for West Germany compared with $45.9 billion
for the United States.
   U.S. imports in 1987 were $424 billion, compared with $228
billion for West Germany, $158 billion for France, $154 billion for
Britain and $151 billion for Japan.
   The IMF figures, in an IMF publication released Friday, show
total trade increased 10 percent in 1986 and 18 percent in 1987.
   The fund reported that trade among the biggest countries
remained far out of balance in 1986 and 1987. The United States
imported much more than it exported, while the reverse was true for
Japan and West Germany.
   The IMF said U.S. sales grew by 15.2 percent and purchases by
9.6 percent in 1987 over the year earlier, while Japan's exports
rose up 9.3 percent and imports were up 18.2 percent and Germany's
imports and exports each grew by about 20 percent.
   Both Japan and West Germany have been undr international
pressure, especially from the United States, to increase their
imports and curb their exports.
   Last year's total trade marked a return to the annual average of
the 1970s, the publication noted.
   The IMF said trade within the European Economic Community
increased ``at substantially higher rates in 1986 and 1987 than
overall trade within industrial countries.''
   ``The trade of developing countries also grew substantially,
reversing the stagnation of the previous three years,'' it added.
   The fund includes among ``developing countries'' its other 131
members, many of them poorer lands where incomes have declined,
like much of Africa and Latin America, as well as more prosperous
countries where conditions are improving, such as South Korea and
Singapore.

<HEAD>Police Say Hit Man, Age 17, May Have Been Involved In 10 Murders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities say the shooting death of a
boyish-looking 17-year-old ends the criminal career of a drug
dealer and hit man who may have been involved in 10 murders, but
his mother says police have it all wrong.
   Rakie Cloyd, gunned down Thursday night at a housing project
with four shots to his back and the back of his head, was best
known to police as a killer for a Richmond drug dealer, said
homicide detective C.T. Woody.
   ``Seven homicides that he probably was the shooter in _ 10
homicides that he was involved in,'' Woody told the Richmond
Times-Dispatch. ``Sometimes he'd stand and tell somebody else to
kill them.''
   ``He was small and quiet. Just sitting in the courtroom, you
would think he was a little kid,'' said Assistant Commonwealth's
Attorney Learned Barry. ``I'm afraid he's kind of the wave of the
future. Our killers are getting younger and younger all of the
time.''
   Woody said Cloyd's age and appearance belied his criminal
character.
   ``He would definitely hurt you,'' Woody said. ``He would do what
his superiors told him to do and not care. They told him to kill.
And he never really seemed to mind.''
   But Cloyd's mother, Barbara Taylor, said her son was a high
school student who excelled in football and basketball.
   ``He wasn't with no bad crowd of people,'' Ms. Taylor said in an
interview at her apartment Friday. ``I wouldn't be living here if
my son were a dope dealer.''
   ``They're trying to make my son look like a monster or an
animal,'' she said. ``I don't care ... I know the kind of person my
son was ... a loving person.''
   Police Maj. V. Stuart Cook said that in February 1987, Cloyd
killed Herbert L. Cunningham, 20, with 17 shots from an Uzi
submachine gun. Cloyd was charged as an adult with murder, but the
charge was dismissed after a key witness failed to appear in court.
   Cook said he is considering asking prosecutors whether to
consider some of the 10 slayings cleared, meaning authorities
believe they know who is responsible for the crime and the suspect
is either dead or in prison.
   Woody said he and his partner had told Ms. Taylor that they
thought her son had killed several people and that he might be
killed himself.
   ``She said we were wrong,'' Woody said. ``She said we had the
wrong person. He got a lot of support at home. The family got angry
with us.''
   Barry said police were not the only people who expressed concern
about Cloyd's activities.
   Barry said that on May 20, when he had to request that the
Cunningham slaying charge against Cloyd be dropped, Circuit Judge
James B. Wilkinson lectured the defendant.
   ``This is the first case I can remember, ever, where the judge
took the time to tell him `Either clean up your act or you're going
to get killed,''' Barry said.
   Because of Cloyd's age, his juvenile court records are sealed by
law, but one of the prosecutors for Richmond Juvenile and Domestic
Relations Court expressed familiarity with Cloyd's past when told
of his death.
   ``We were expecting it last year,'' said Assistant
Commonwealth's Attorney Pat Bell. ``I'm surprised he lasted as long
as he did. I'm really sorry it happened, but I'm not surprised.''
   Police said they have no suspects in Cloyd's death.

   A vault containing the Hope Diamond popped
open Saturday after being stuck shut for four days, hiding one of
the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History's most popular
attractions.
   Crowds gathering around the 44.4 carat blue diamond acquired by
the museum in 1958 were confronted with a printed sign saying the
diamond could not be displayed.
   Museum officials said they believe the timer on the vault
holding the diamond may have malfunctioned.
   ``Mechanics are looking at it, and the men that maintain the
safe are checking it out,'' museum spokesman Tom Harney said. ``We
should be able to tell next week what went wrong.''
   The vault opened shortly before the museum's 10 a.m. scheduled
opening Saturday, Harney said. The diamond is kept behind a thick
layer of bulletproof glass covered by a heavy, non-transparent door
that a timer opens so the gem can be displayed.
   The museum had trouble with the safe once before, in 1967. But
that problem was resolved when museum officials discovered that a
substitute guard had simply forgotten how to make it open.
   Despite the possibility the vault could jam shut again, museum
officials said they were locking up the priceless gem at the close
of business Saturday.

<TEXT>
   Mindful of Geraldine Ferraro's ill-fated vice
presidential quest in 1984, Michael Dukakis had aides accompany
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen on his first campaign solo flight.
   The 67-year-old Bentsen is no stranger to campaign work, and the
silver-haired senator took several of his own aides with him on the
campaign foray to California, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas last
week.
   Officials in both the Dukakis and Bentsen camps remember how
Ferraro, Walter F. Mondale's running mate four years ago, hit the
campaign trail unprepared, and want to closely coordinate campaign
activities.
   Mrs. Ferraro badly mishandled the controversy surrounding her
husband's finances, and the issue quickly destroyed any momentum
the Democrats had following their nominating convention in San
Francisco. The ticket went on to lose 49 of the 50 states to Ronald
Reagan.
   ``They put her out, basically without any senior help from the
Mondale campaign,'' said Francis O'Brien, who had been called in to
help rescue the Ferraro campaign, and was on the Bentsen plane last
week.
   Four years ago, ``there was a lack of communication between the
two campaigns,'' he said. ``People who went through that experience
learned from that experience.''
   O'Brien led a cadre of Dukakis people on the Bentsen plane,
including Tad Devine, the Dukakis chief delegate-counter before the
convention, who will coordinate and direct the senator's campaign
from the Dukakis headquarters in Boston. Devine also worked for
Mondale four years ago.
   But Bentsen also will keep a group of his long-time advisers
with him to handle day-to-day issues.
   ``We've done a very good job of integrating the Dukakis staff,''
said Joseph O'Neill, a former Bentsen aide on Capitol Hill, who
will become his top traveling campaign staffer.
   A formal announcement of the campaign staff is planned later
this week, said Jack DeVore, Bentsen's spokesman.
   Bentsen's campaigning was kept at a deliberate pace last week
with careful staging of each event.
   His speeches were cautious, citing his Senate record on issues
of interest to each audience and working in some digs at the Reagan
administration _ but avoiding harsh attacks.
   Care was also taken to emphasize areas where he and Dukakis
agree.
   While the Bentsen choice is certainly a lot less daring than
Mondale's Ferraro decision, Bentsen and Dukakis probably have more
disagreements on policy. Bentsen is much more conservative on some
issues, including his opposition to gun control, support for aid to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and school prayer.
   The political message for the trip was found mostly in the
locations, which were designed to highlight the Dukakis campaign
theme of aggressively going after electoral votes that the
Republicans have controlled for years. The Democrats last won Texas
in 1976, and haven't won New Mexico, Nevada or California since
1964.
   Bentsen, a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment, found a
friendly audience with a businesswomen's group in Albuquerque. He
played a ``come home to the Democratic Party'' theme to a union
audience in San Francisco, in Nevada and at his Texas stop in
Amarillo _ a Republican area that's home to his opponent in this
year's Senate race, Rep. Beau Boulter.
   As permitted by Texas law, Bentsen is running for the vice
presidency and the Senate at the same time.
   The trip hit two areas a day, instead of the three-a-day planned
for later in the campaign.
   As a state-wide campaigner in Texas, the national campaign isn't
as big a step up for Bentsen as it was for Ferraro, a member of the
House from Queens, N.Y. Bentsen also has the experience of his
unsuccessful 1976 campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   The senator said that from his viewpoint ``it's gone very
well,'' and he was surprised he didn't face a sea of Bush signs at
his rally in Amarillo.
   ``I think we could have done a few more things,'' he said. ``But
we wanted some time in there in case things weren't working out.''
   The trip was cut short by a day when the campaign canceled a
planned visit to Mississippi because of a conflict with Dukakis'
schedule.
   Bentsen returned to Washington, where he plans to immerse
himself in a heavy Senate schedule including action on the trade
and plant-closing notification bills.
   Dukakis aides said Bentsen's congressional schedule was a plus
even though it will cut into his campaign time. One aide said it
provides ``meat and potatoes'' for the Democratic effort.
   Bentsen says he expects to campaign in Texas, the South and
Southwest. But aides say it's still to be decided how the
candidate's time will be apportioned.
   ``That's going to be a part of the discussion'' as the campaign
begins to nail down staffing and strategy in the next few days,
O'Neill said Friday.
   On the road, Bentsen said he was encouraged by the large number
of local officials who want to appear on the dais with him and
Dukakis when they hit town.
   Aides said that kind of reaction is a good indication of the
level of local support.

<HEAD>Rebel Leader Says Attacks Slowing Soviet Withdrawal; Rockets Kill
Five</HEAD>

   An Afghan resistance leader said
Saturday that guerrilla attacks in Afghanistan are delaying the Red
Army's withdrawal, and he urged the rebels to hold off on the raids
and let the Soviets leave.
   Radio Kabul reported that rocket attacks killed at least five
people in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad. It blamed the
attacks on Moslem guerrillas.
   The Saturday report, monitored in Pakistan, said 34 rockets
blasted the city about 75 miles east of Kabul, Afghanistan's
capital. It said 11 people were injured.
   ``If the Soviets are really withdrawing and not bringing
problems and harm to the areas they are withdrawing from ... They
should let them go,'' resistance leader Burhanuddin Rabbani told
The Associated Press. ``I believe the Soviets should go sooner and
we should not stop them.''
   Under terms of a U.N.-mediated accord signed April 14, the
Soviets began withdrawing their troops from Afghanistan in May and
are to have them all out by February. The Red Army entered
Afghanistan in 1979 to support the government in its war with
anti-Marxist guerrillas.
   Rabbani said the Soviets ``hesitate'' to withdraw from a post
when guerrillas begin to apply pressure because they don't believe
the Afghan army can survive alone. ``So they are making their
withdrawal movement slower than before,'' he said.
   Rocket attacks on the Afghan capital have prompted foreign
embassies to reduce staff and encourage dependents to leave the
country. In a single week in mid-July, as many as 200 rockets
blasted the capital, said Western diplomats.
   Britain plans to evacuate 10 of its citizens from Afghanistan
this week because of fears of increased guerrilla attacks on Kabul,
the Foreign Office said Saturday.
   It has advised 98 others to leave the war-torn country. That
includes 45 Britons and 53 citizens of other countries which
Britain represents in Afghanistan, including Australia, New Zealand
and Finland.

   A nine-day national festival spotlighting black
artists opened Saturday featuring a play by Pulitizer Prize winner
Charles Fuller that examined the sometimes bitter experience of
freedom for former slaves.
   The world premiere of Fuller's latest effort, ``Sally,'' took
place Friday night at the Alliance Theater in an unofficial
kick-off to the first National Black Arts Festival.
   The festival formally began Saturday with a parade through
downtown Atlanta, an artist's market, a folk arts festival, an
African puppet show, the second performance of ``Sally'' and a
production of ``Sisters'' by Atlanta playwright Marsha Jackson.
   Hundreds of thousands are expected to attend more than 100
events showcasing black artists in eight disciplines _ theater,
folk arts, dance, film and video, music, visual arts, literature
and performance art.
   ``Sally,'' produced by the Negro Ensemble Company, is the first
of a five-part series that Fuller is planning on the slaves'
introduction to freedom. Fuller has worked with the company before;
their most noted collaboration was ``A Soldier's Play,'' which won
the Pulitzer Prize in 1982.
   ``Sally'' centers on a black regiment of the Union Army
stationed in Beaufort, S.C., during the Civil War. The soldiers,
runaway slaves, initially are attracted to the Yankees by the
promise of freedom, but they soon learn that freedom will not bring
equality.
   A recurring theme of the play is the soldiers' pay. It is $10 a
month for white soliders, but Congress cuts the blacks' to $7.
   The inequity causes them to ask if a black man's life is worth
less than that of a white, and leads the play's male lead, Sgt.
Prince Logan, to make an agonizing choice between whether to stick
with his angry men or with a general who wants to impress
Washington with a show of unity.
   But the unity has long been broken by the pay issue. One black
soldier, Vendross, played by O.L. Duke, screams at his comrades,
``The only difference between slave and free is pay, niggers!''
   Douglas Turner Ward, a co-founder of the Negro Ensemble Company
who directed ``Sally'' and also plays the role of Prince, said his
focus lately has been solely on the play, despite his involvement
in organizing the festival.
   Ward said he expects ``Sally'' and one of the next installments
in the series to debut in New York later this year. He expects to
be off stage by then.
   ``I really consider myself pinch-hitting as an actor. I don't
consider my performance as a pinch-hitting performance, but my
intention (is), as we add the second play, I'm going to try someone
else as Prince,'' he said.
   Ward said one of the main attractions of ``Sally,'' to him, was
its portrayal of the different ways that people approached their
freedom.
   ``The interesting thing about the play (is) for the slaves, it's
their first taste of freedom,'' Ward said. ``They know what slavery
is, but they don't know what freedom is, except theoretically, and
that's what this play captures _ the complexity of responses.''
   ``Sally'' was warmly received by about 600 people who attended
the opening night performance at the 800-seat theater.

   Britain plans to evacuate 10 embassy workers and
their dependents from Afghanistan this week because of fears of
increased guerrilla attacks on the capital of Kabul, the Foreign
Office said Saturday.
   It has advised 98 other people to leave the country. That
includes 45 Britons and 53 citizens of other countries which
Britain represents in Afghanistan, including Australia, New Zealand
and Finland.
   ``We have advised dependents and non-essential personnel among
the British community to leave in view of the deteriorating
security situation in Kabul,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman,
speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   ``We are withdrawing dependents and non-essential staff from our
embassy. Essential staff will remain, the embassy will continue to
function,'' he said.
   The spokesman said Britain is responsible for about 110 people
in Afghanistan, most of them Britons. The government does not have
a firm figure because some Britons are not registered with the
embassy, he said.
   The evacuation follows seven days of rocket strikes on Kabul by
Moslem guerrillas trying to topple the Marxist government.
   Soviet troops entered the country in December 1979 to help the
government in the civil war. The Red Army began withdrawing in May
under terms of a U.N.-mediated accord.

   Demolition experts on Saturday defused a
500-pound World War II bomb that forced evacuation of about 3,000
people from a Naples suburb.
   The bomb was discovered Friday afternoon during excavation for a
water line in the suburb of Boscotrecase.
   Demolition experts had trouble defusing the bomb because the
fuse had been damaged when the device was struck by the machine
digging the trench.
   Boscotrecase Mayor Pasquale de Falco, who ordered the
evacuation, said earlier that demolition experts had said they
might need three days to defuse the bomb.
   Authorities used loudspeakers, and military police went door to
door to warn residents to evacuate the area.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address, given by Sen. Carl Levin
of Michigan:
   I'm pleased that the Senate and the House have passed drought
relief legislation. This is an important first step in addressing a
situation that threatens America's farmers and affects every one of
us.
   But today I want to talk abut two other bills passed by
Contgress _ ono. I want to tell you why.
   The first of these is the defense bill. President reagan
requested about $300 billion in spending for the nation's defense
in 1989. the Senate and the House approved the total amount the
president asked for, but we differed with the president on just how
we should spend that money to make the nation more secure.
   As in the past, President Reagan overemphasized nuclear weapons
and Star Wars at the expense of our conventional forces. He also
proposed actions which would make effective arms control harder to
achieve and maintain.
   Let me give you an example. President Reagan requested almost $5
billion for St ar Wars, a 24 percent increase over last year's
level. At the same time, he proposed cutting the Army's ammunition
purchases by over 10 percent. Those are the wrong priorities. They
waste money on redundant nuclear weapons and exotic space weapons
research while shortchanging needed conventional capabilities that
would make nuclear war less likely.
   That is why Congress rearranged the spending priorities in the
bill. We held Star Wars spending at last year's level and used the
savings to increase spending on needed Army ammunition and initiate
a program to develop new weapons that can stop modern Soviet tanks.
   We also placed limits on how star Wars funds can be spent to
ensure that the United States does not violate the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty we signed with the Soviets. The last thing we need
is a new arms race in space, especially while we are trying to
conclude a treaty that would cut both sides' existing nuclear
arsenals by 50 percent.
   Unfortunately, a few of his advisers urged President Reagan to
veto the bill Congress passed and to go back to his original
defense priorities. that was bad advise. After all, even his own
secretary of defense and national security adviser supported the
bill.
   Another important bill which deserves the president's support is
the legislation which requires companies employing 100 or more
workers to give 60 days notice prior to a plant closing or a major
layoff.
   President Reagan concedes the notifying of workers who are about
to lose their jobs is ``the humane thing to do.''
   But President Reagan says that he thinks that providing notice
to workers should be voluntary. But, of course, it already is.
   This bill isn't aimed at companies that are going to do the
decent thing anyway. It is aimed at companies, like one I know in
Michigan, that told its workers on a Friday afternoon that they
were being laid off for two weeks.
   But then, over the weekend, workers living near the plant saw it
being dismantled, its machinery carted off on flatbed trucks.
   That is how 130 workers discovered they were losing their jobs.
Of that number, 45 had been with the company between 30 and 40
years.
   Worst of all, the plant's owners knew that they were going to
shut it down for the previous six months. They intentionally kept
their employees in the dark, intentionally kept them from making
the plans necessary for cushioning the blow and starting anew.
   The advance notification bill would prevent human tragedies like
that. It would also give workers and the states and towns in which
they live one final chance ot try to save the plant from closing
down. And these are reasons the president should support it.
   One more point. Governor Dukakis supports this bill and pushed
through a similar law in Massachusetts. But we haven't heard from
Vice President Bush on this bill. Where is George?
   Most Americans favor this advance notification bill. But does
Vice President Bush?
   These two bills, the 1989 defense bill and the plant closing
notification, are very different. But taken together they advance a
goal we all share: security and dignity for all Americans and for
our country.
   Thank you.

<HEAD>Iranian Envoy Says Iran Would Accept Talks with Iraq</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-UN-Peace Talks, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian envoy said
Saturday that Iran is willing to hold direct talks with Iraq if
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar deems it necessary
to achieving peace.
   ``I ... officially declare that there is no obstacle or problem
hindering direct talks with Iraq,'' Iran's deputy foreign minister,
Ali Mohammed Besharati told a press conference.
   Besharati arrived in Abu Dhabi earlier Saturday on a tour of
Persian Gulf states. It is the first such visit by an Iranian
official since Iran's July 18 acceptance of U.N. Resolution 598,
calling for a cease-fire in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   Iraq has insisted on direct talks with Iran before a cease-fire.
Iran has rejected this but indicated it would be willing to hold
face-to-face talks after a cease-fire.
   When asked whether Iran was prepared to conduct direct talks
with Iraq before the cease-fire, Besharati replied, ``We thought of
cease-fire and peace. In order to reach this, we cooperated with
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, and if de Cuellar
sees it as necessary to reach this end, we will accept it.''
   Besharati spoke in Farsi, and an interpreter gave the English
translation.
   When asked to clearly state whether Iran accepts direct talks,
he said ``I am hereby the deputy foreign minister of Iran
officially declaring that there is no obstacle or problem hindering
direct talks with Iraq.''
   There was no immediate comment from Iranian officials at the
United Nations, where Perez de Cuellar is holding separate meetings
with the warring sides. Calls to the Iranian Mission went
unanswered Saturday.
   Perez de Cuellar met earlier Saturday with Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati before adjourning talks for the
weekend. Velayati refused comment on the meeting.
   Perez de Cuellar told reporters he is ``maintaining pressure on
all sides in order to obtain a quick way out of the present
situation'' _ referring to the deadlock on face-to-face talks.
   Diplomatic sources at the United Nations said that Saudi Arabia,
a major supporter of Iraq, has joined other nations trying to
pressure Baghdad to compromise and agree to a cease-fire before
direct talks.
   Perez de Cuellar called reports of Saudi pressure
``imaginative.'' He said he met Friday with Prince Bandar bin
Sultan bin Badul Aziz, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Washington.
   ``He expressed the support of his country for my efforts. They
are playing a role,'' he told reporters. Prince Bandar also met
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz on Friday.
   Iraq's former U.N. ambassador, Riyadh al-Qaysi, denied reports
of pressure.
   ``I tell you categorically there is no such pressure on Iraq. No
such pressure is there on Iraq from any quarter,'' he told
reporters outside U.N. Headquarters.

   Think you recognize that shopper? Don't say hello
yet _ it might be Uncle Charlie.
   The 16th Street Mall is going to be seeded with plastic
sculptures made from life, and you too can get in on the action.
   The sculptures are ``life casts,'' in which artists take a mold
from the body of a living person, cast it in plastic, then dress it
and paint it to look real down to the fingerprints.
   ``My boss is a bit of a crazy man, and he had heard of this,''
said Margaret Sillstrop, researcher and coordinator for the project.
   The project is developer David French's attempt to inject some
fun into downtown, Sillstrop said.
   She said she's recruited people on the mall who look as if they
would make interesting sculptures. French's company also plans a
lottery, with the winner immortalized in fiberglass.
   The 20-pound sculptures will be sold at cost, $3,500, to
businesses on the mall. Sillstrop hopes to have eight or nine up by
Sept. 1 and 15-20 by December. The sculptures will be bolted down
and will be removed at night and during snow or rain.
   Sillstrop's 69-year-old uncle, Charlie Shugarts, was the first
model for sculptors Porter Arnill and Greg Lamb. The sculptors and
painters Quang Ho and Jay Moore can turn out a finished product in
80 hours.
   On Thursday, Shugarts' likeness was put on a bench as Shugarts
watched.
   ``My brother-in-law turned to me and said, `I hope you look that
good in your casket,''' Shugarts said.

   The 1,000 nudists gathering for a
convention here this weekend hope their contribution to the economy
isn't as invisible as their clothing.
   Or as visible as their skins.
   Planners of the 35th annual Midwest Sunbathing Association
Convention bought $3,000 in $2 bills and are selling them at cost
to campers, who will spend them when they get dressed and go to
town.
   The MSA convention at Sunny Haven Park is similar to any other
large convention, except that participants conduct most of their
business in the nude.
   Like other American Sunbathing Association clubs, Sunny Haven
stresses nudism and family. It has been located here for 41 years.
   ``Most clubs limit the numbers of singles they admit,'' said Sue
Ward, president of MSA. ``Our main focus is on couples and family.
(The ideal member) comes to us with lots of little kids.''
   For most campers, the convention is a chance to relax and get
reacquainted.
   ``These are people that we only see once a year,'' said Pirie
Cleveland, a 21-year ASA member. ``They're like family, the best
friends in the world.''
   The group has traditions that are carried on each. For instance,
anyone can have their club's logo drawn on their posterior.
   ``It's fun and makes you immediately identifiable,'' said Diane,
Sunny Haven treasurer. She declined to reveal her last name.
   Nudists typically don't use last names at gatherings, she said,
adding, ``It's a constriction society has forced on us.''

<HEAD>Bank Rescues May Hurt Efforts to Curb Federal Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quip attributed to the late Sen. Everett
Dirksen _ ``A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you're
talking about real money'' _ is coming painfully true for federal
bank regulators.
   The $4 billion rescue of First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas and
the closing and rescue of other banks this year will cause the
government insurance fund that backs deposits in commercial banks
to suffer the first loss in its 54-year history.
   Add in billions of dollars being spent to assist the even more
troubled savings and loan industry and it means ``real money'' _
enough to hamper the government's fight to curb the massive federal
budget deficit.
   Money spent by the federal deposit insurance agencies _ the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for the nation's 13,500 commercial
banks and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. for 3,100
savings institutions _ does not come from taxpayers, at least not
yet. Both the FDIC and the FSLIC derive their money from an
assessment on member institutions.
   However, revenue to the funds counts as a government receipt for
federal budget purposes. When spending exceeds receipts, it
inflates the budget deficit, projected by the administration to hit
$152.3 billion for fiscal 1988.
   So far this year, FSLIC has had two multi-billion-dollar
transactions. It spent $2 billion to help Southwest Savings
Association of Dallas take over four smaller institutions in May
and $1.3 billion a month later to close two severely insolvent S&Ls
in Costa Mesa, Calif.
   FSLIC is looking at spending $1.3 billion to $2 billion more
early this fall on Irvine, Calif.,-based Financial Corp. of
America, the nation's second-largest thrift holding company.
   It's unknown if the FDIC faces any other big expenditures, but
analysts have been watching the efforts of MCorp, another large
Dallas bank, to pull itself out of its hole by attracting
additional investors.
   According to a congressional aide, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, budget watchers earlier this year were worried that
federal spending on sick financial institutions could trigger
automatic, across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit reduction.
   Stronger than expected tax collections in May and June have
eased the concern, for now.
   Still, the White House Office of Management and Budget, in a
mid-year budget review released Thursday, boosted its estimate of
FDIC spending this year by $1.7 billion and by $1.2 billion in
1989. The estimate for FSLIC was increased by $2.9 billion for 1988
and $1.7 billion for next year.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, in announcing the First
RepublicBank rescue late Friday night, told reporters he expected
the FDIC to suffer its first loss since its founding in 1934.
   Until now, revenue from banks and interest on investments has
always outweighed whatever it spent to protect depositors in
failures and forced mergers.
   Even in 1984, when the FDIC bailed out Continental Illinois
Corp. of Chicago with $4.5 billion in the largest rescue ever, the
agency made money. But all bank failures only totaled 79 in 1984.
This year, they are expected to equal or surpass the
post-Depression record of 184 set in 1987.
   Seidman said the fund, which stood at $18.3 billion at the end
of 1987, would likely lose close to $2 billion this year. But, he
cautioned, that's a ``best guess'' and the loss could go higher.
   ``When you forecast ... you often get into trouble and your
crystal ball ends up looking like ground glass,'' he said.
   The effect of the wave of financial institution failures on the
budget several years down the road could be even more pronounced.
FSLIC, which is technically insolvent, is in even worse shape than
the FDIC and faces more severe problems.
   And, unlike the FDIC, FSLIC in its assistance packages is using
notes rather than cash, obligating it to pay billions of dollars as
much as 10 years in the future.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, FSLIC's parent agency, says it
expects to have just enough money over the next 10 years to pay the
$30.9 billion cost of closing or merging insolvent S&Ls.
   However, private analysts put the price tag as high as $75
billion and the House and Senate banking committees are already
debating about the prospects for a taxpayer bailout in order to
fulfill the government's obligations to depositors.

   After nearly eight years of conflict on
the battlefield, Iran and Iraq seemed locked in dispute at the
United Nations last week over Iraq's demand for face-to-face talks
before a cease-fire.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who brought the
foreign ministers of the two countries to New York last week,
insisted the obstacles to an accord were merely procedural. He said
he hopes to announce a cease-fire date sometime this week.
   But despite the secretary-general's optimism, progress has
appeared slow and halting.
   Movement toward the current talks began July 18, when Iran
reversed a year-long stance and said it would accept a U.N.
resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire.
   The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's spiritual leader, said
opting for peace without victory and overthrow of the Iraqi regime
was like ``swallowing poison.''
   The bitter broth was sweet news to the international community.
But it fueled Iraqi suspicions that Iran was insincere and only
sought a temporary truce to rebuild its forces.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz insisted there could be no
cease-fire or further negotiations without first holding
face-to-face talks, which he says would offer proof of Iran's
sincerity.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati rejected the demand.
He said Friday there would be no direct talks before a cease-fire
and rejected what he called Iraq's efforts to delay a peace
settlement.
   The issue was further complicated Saturday with remarks by
Iran's deputy foreign minister, Ali Mohammed Besharati, who told a
news conference in Abu Dhabi that Iran would participate in direct
talks if Perez de Cuellar asked it to.
   Here is where the U.N. talks stand now:
   _Points of Agreement:
   Both sides unconditionally accept Resolution 598, a 10-point
plan including an immediate cease-fire and troop withdrawal, a
prisoner exchange, formal peace talks and a commission to determine
which side was the aggressor in the war.
   Both agreed to hold immediate, separate talks with the
secretary-general on implementing the resolution. They agree the
secretary-general will set dates for the different phases of the
plan.
   A team of U.N. military experts has visited both capitals to
work out details of a cease-fire, and another is investigating
prisoner-of-war issues in both countries.
   _Points of Disagreement:
   Iraq insists on direct talks in New York before a cease-fire,
while Iran rejects direct talks at this time.
   Iraq also demands that before a cease-fire goes into effect,
Iran promise not to attack Iraqi and neutral shipping in the
Persian Gulf. It also calls for the United Nations to dredge the
disputed Shatt Al-Arab waterway, the southern boundary between the
two nations.
   Iran will make no commitments on these issues.
   _Participants:
   Perez de Cuellar: A 67-year-old Peruvian diplomat, Perez de
Cuellar is known for diligence and determination rather than
dynamism. He is the first Latin American to hold the post of
secretary-general, now in his second five-year term. He is
considered a patient, skillful negotiator.
   Iraq's Tariq Aziz: Appointed in 1981 as foreign minister, the
51-year-old Aziz is a long-time colleague of President Sadam
Hussein in Iraq's Baath Party. He sometimes is referred to as
Hussein's right-hand man.
   Aziz, a Christian, is considered one of the most eloquent
spokesmen of the Iraqi government.
   Iran's Ali Akbar Velayati: A 43-year-old pediatrician, Velayati
trained at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. In Iran he has
been active in establishing relief centers and clinics.
   In 1977, Velayati denounced the Shah and was arrested for
anti-government activities. He was active in welcoming Khomeini to
Iran and later was named by Khomeini as his representative for
national reconstruction.
   Since Tuesday, Perez de Cuellar has met five times with Velayati
and three times with Aziz. Talks are scheduled to begin again
Monday.

   The Communist Party committee in the Volga River
region of Kuybyshev on Saturday removed its leader after
demonstrations by thousands of residents demanding his resignation.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said the Kuybyshev
committee, at a plenary meeting, relieved Yevgeny F. Muravyev of
his duties as party first secretary ``in connection with his
retirement.'' The brief dispatch did not elaborate on the reason
for Muravyev's removal and did not mention the residents' protest
campaign.
   In an indication of high-level Kremlin concern for the
situation, Tass reported that a member of the country's ruling
Politburo, Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, spoke at the Kuybyshev party
meeting.
   Moscow-based members of the informal political group Democratic
Union reported that an estimated 40,000 Kuybyshev residents rallied
July 21 to demand replacement of Muravyev. The residents also
threatened a strike in the important industrial region, where
aircraft, locomotives, tractors, chemicals and textiles are
produced, the Democratic Union reported.
   A protest in Kuybyshev on June 22 involved 10,000 people, the
political group said.
   The demonstrators complained that the 59-year-old Muravyev was
responsible for food shortages, dirty streets, poor transportation
and unfair distribution of housing in Kuybyshev, a city of 1.2
million people 530 miles southeast of Moscow.
   Muravyev, an engineer, was appointed Kuybyshev first secretary
in 1979. He is also a member of the nationwide party Central
Committee and legislature, the Supreme Soviet.
   Tass said the party committee replaced Muravyev with V.G.
Afonin, the head of the Central Committee's chemical industry
department.

``aggression'' against Nicaragua.
   Nicaragua was not invited to attend the meeting, at which Shultz
is expected to endorse a ``statement of principles'' on what is
needed to get a Central American peace plan moving again.
   The plan, drawn up by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, is
aimed at negotiating an end to the war in Nicaragua and leftist
guerrilla wars in El Salvador and Honduras.
   The Sandinistas claim Nicaragua has made the most progress in
complying with the plan, even though they say the United States
violated the spirit of the accord this year when it approved
non-lethal aid to the Contra rebels fighting the Nicaraguan
government.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco and other leaders say
Honduras still tolerates the presence of Contra camps in its
territory, and both El Salvador and Guatemala have failed to get
truce negotiations under way with their guerrilla foes.
   ``No one is fulfilling the plan but Nicaragua,'' Tinoco said in
a recent interview. ``It has turned into everyone picking on what
Nicaragua does. We insist all actors and factors accept their quota
of responsibility.''
   The Sandinistas concede that, of the five Central American
countries, Nicaragua made the greatest effort to reach agreement
with its insurgents because it had the most to gain _ influencing
Congress to end U.S. aid to the Contras.
   But Tinoco pointed out the peace plan was signed by five
countries and is binding on all.
   ``This was a promise by five countries, not just Nicaragua,''
Tinoco said, adding that the Sandinistas have made great efforts to
negotiate with Contra leaders _ something they had vowed they would
never do.
   The Sandinistas signed a cease-fire agreement with the Contras
March 23 which has often been violated. Talks for a permanent truce
broke down June 9.
   The government also lifted a national emergency law suspending
individual freedoms, in force since the U.S. began supplying aid to
the rebels in 1981. It loosened restrictions on the opposition
press and released about 1,000 of an estimated 4,000 political
prisoners.

   Conservative lawmakers on Saturday denounced New
York Mayor Edward Koch for retracting his remarks that Britain was
playing a ``positive role'' in Northern Ireland.
   ``Any man who makes a strong statement and because of political
pressure changes his mind is not worth the office he holds,'' said
Terry Dicks, a Conservative member of Parliament. ``He (Koch) is a
weak-kneed politician who has to look over his shoulder to see
where his votes lie.''
   Koch apologized to New Yorkers of Irish descent Friday for the
``unfortunate use of language'' in his statement regarding the
British role in Northern Ireland. He said he was wrong to suggest
that the British are not an occupying army in Northern Ireland, and
he urged a timetable for British withdrawal from the province.
   ``What I meant to convey was that there has been a modest change
in the British role in Northern Ireland, a change which ought to be
encouraged,'' the mayor said.
   Koch said through a spokesman Saturday, ``Having been called to
task by those who are more familiar with the facts because they
have a greater understanding of these 800 years of oppression, I
chose to do what any honorable gentleman should do: admit my error,
correct the record and say what I believe to be the truth.''
   His original remarks, made Wednesday after a visit to the
province, were praised by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   ``If more people came with an open mind and looked at what is
happening ... we would have many others making similar remarks,''
she told the House of Commons on Thursday.
   Members of her governing Conservative Party objected to Koch's
apology.
   Conservative lawmaker Robert Adley said, ``I regret the naivity
of any British politicians allowing themselves to be taken in by
visiting Americans who are remotely likely to understand the
situation or to be able to comment positively in the unlikely event
that they do understand it.
   ``What Mayor Koch and his creepy-crawly colleagues in New York
should realize is that most of the Protestants have been in
Northern Ireland far longer than they have been in America,'' he
said.
   Adley added, ``If there are to be any occupying armies
withdrawn, it is the whites who should get out of the United States
and hand the country back to the red Indians.''
   Lawmaker Barry Porter said, ``One must believe that what Mayor
Koch said when he got back from Northern Ireland was what he really
felt about the situation.
   ``He is now trying to do a political Houdini, and I do not think
he will succeed. I regret what he has now done.''
   Koch was in Ireland on a six-day peace pilgrimage led by New
York's Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor. On Wednesday, after
he returned to New York, Koch said he accepted the British army as
a peacekeeping force rather than an occupying army in Northern
Ireland.
   The almost exclusively Catholic Irish Republican Army is
fighting to push the British out of the Protestant-dominated
province, join it with the Republic of Ireland and set up an
all-Ireland socialist state.

   Dozens of friends, relatives and former
colleagues flocked to Menachem Begin's small home Saturday to mark
the 75th birthday of the former prime minister, who became a
recluse after his sudden resignation five years ago.
   The steady stream of visitors bearing flowers, a bronze plaque
and dozens of cakes created a small traffic jam on narrow Tzemach
Street near the Jerusalem Forest.
   Security agents screened the guests, who included Benyamin
Netanyahu, the former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and
a rising star of the Likud bloc that Begin once led. Popular
Israeli singer Yoram Gaon also attended.
   ``He looks great, but of course he should gain weight,'' said
visitor Matti Droblas, an official of the quasi-governmental Jewish
Agency and a friend of Begin's.
   The former prime minister was in good spirits and rose to greet
each visitor by name, Droblas said.
   Begin resigned abruptly in 1983, at the height of Israel's
military involvement in Lebanon. He never told even close friends
why he made the dramatic move, telling the Cabinet only: ``I can't
go on any longer.''
   Aides have said Begin was deeply depressed over Israel's soaring
casualties in Lebanon and by the death of his wife, Aliza, in 1982.
   As visitors streamed into Begin's home, a mother who lost her
25-year-old son in Lebanon held a silent vigil outside. Raya
Harnik, of Jerusalem, whose son Guni was killed on the first day of
the war, said she was shocked that people paid homage to Begin.
   ``It's shameless,'' she said. ``This man caused dozens of young
men not to reach even their twentieth birthdays _ he shouldn't let
the visitors come.
   ``In the middle of the war he just said he couldn't go on any
longer,'' Ms. Harnik said. ``The bereaved parents never had such a
privilege.''
   Begin led Israel's invasion into Lebanon in 1982, begining a
three-year occupation. More than 600 Israeli soldiers were killed
in the war.
   Despite his seclusion, Begin remains a prominent behind-the
scenes political figure. He is deluged daily with mail from
well-wishers and people urging him to write his memoirs, according
to long-time aide Yehiel Kadishai.
   On Friday, Begin gave a rare interview on Israel radio and
invited listeners to share in his birthday ceremonies.
   ``Those who remember and want to come _ come,'' he said.
   The retired leader spends most of his days reading or watching
television with his daughter Leah, a flight attendant who lives
with him.
   Kadishai said Begin ``reads everything in print,'' including
novels and non-fiction in Hebrew and English. His favorite author
is the late Primo Levi, who wrote about the Nazi Holocaust.
   Begin was born in Poland. His parents and a brother were among
the 6 million Jews who were killed by the Nazis during World War II.
   Benjamin Begin, 45, the former prime minister's son, is running
for parliament with the Herut party that his father founded. Herut
is the major partner in the Likud bloc.

   Nine Kurdish guerrillas and a police
officer were killed Saturday in a clash in the southeastern
province of Diyarbakir, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
   The guerrillas were believed to be members of the outlawed
Kurdish Labor Party, which wants to set up a Marxist state in parts
of eastern and southeastern Turkey, Anatolia reported.
   It did not elaborate on the clash.
   More than 900 civilians and security personnel and about the
same number of insurgents have been killed since the rebels started
hit-and-run attacks in 1984, official reports say.
   Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of Turkey's population of
52 million.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will
try to mend a year-old Central American peace plan now in tatters
when he meets here this week with four of the region's foreign
ministers.
   Shultz's initiative appears aimed at increasing diplomatic
pressure on Nicaragua's Sandinista regime and encouraging four
other countries to pursue a negotiated settlement to the area's
conflicts.
   On Monday, the foreign ministers of Guatemala, Honduras, Costa
Rica and El Salvador _ but not Nicaragua _ will present Shultz with
a ``statement of principles'' the Central American leaders agree
are needed to achieve peace. Nicaragua was not invited to the
meeting.
   The secretary of state is expected to endorse the principles,
which have not been released publicly, before continuing on a
nine-day trip to Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Bolivia to discuss
South American problems with the leaders of those countries. Shultz
is then to return to meet with the presidents of Costa Rica, El
Salvador and Honduras.
   The peace plan, signed Aug. 7, 1987, by Guatemala, Costa Rica,
El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, came apart when the leaders in
January failed to extend its deadlines and abolished an
international commission named to verify progress.
   Instead, they vowed to keep working together toward peace.
   But another meeting of the five presidents to review the plan's
progress, tentatively scheduled for Aug. 7, has been shelved
indefinitely.
   El Salvador still is in the midst of a bloody guerrilla war. A
fragile cease-fire in Nicaragua is broken almost daily, and leftist
insurgencies still smolder in Honduras and Guatemala. Only Costa
Rica is at peace.
   ``There are signs that the United States is finally seeking a
more active diplomatic role in the regional process, and that could
revive the peace process,'' said Deane R. Hinton, the U.S.
ambassador in Costa Rica, in a recent interview.
   He added that the United States is seeking a new policy toward
Nicaragua, which has not been fully defined.
   ``Congress has said we can't pursue our interests the way the
president wanted to pursue them,'' Hinton said, referring to
congressional rejection of President Reagan's last request for aid
to the rebels.
   ``If he (Reagan) cannot provide the Contras the weapons that
they ask for to win their cause, then we'll have to try to find
political ways to bring peace and democracy to the area,'' Hinton
added.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, apparently anticipating
that Shultz will urge the foreign ministers to condemn the
Sandinista government for its failure to live up to the peace plan,
recently called for reactivation of the international commission to
verify progress of the plan.
   Ortega said his fellow Central American presidents were
unqualified to judge the plan's progress because they themselves
had failed to live up to it.
   The plan was conceived and promoted by President Oscar Arias of
Costa Rica, who in December won the Nobel Peace Prize for the idea.
   The Arias plan sets deadlines for compliance with negotiated
cease-fires, amnesties, democratization, an end to outside aid to
insurgents and the use of one country's territory by rebels from
neighboring nations. All were to be defined and achieved by Nov. 7,
1987 _ a date that came and went with only minimal compliance.
   Arias, who once said he would be the first to condemn those who
did not adhere to the deadlines, said in January that the peace
process should not be measured by a calendar.
   In the months after it was signed, the plan did bring some hopes
of peace in the region. But the hopes were quickly stilled by
events.
   The governments of El Salvador and Guatemala conducted talks
with leaders of their leftist guerrilla movements, but no progress
resulted.
   The Honduran government claimed Contra camps did not exist
inside its territory and that it had no armed opposition _ an
attitude sharply challenged by recent terrorist attacks on U.S.
servicemen stationed in that country.
   Nicaragua allowed the reopening of the opposition newspaper La
Prensa and a Roman Catholic radio station, freed some of its
political prisoners, lifted the national state of emergency and
began talks with the Contras _ something the Sandinistas said they
would never do.
   But the talks, which broke down in early June, produced only a
temporary, frequently broken cease-fire that has been extended
through August. The two sides remain at an impasse on the question
of a permanent peace in their 7-year-old civil war.
   The Sandinistas say they cannot support greater democracy until
the Contras lay down their arms and rejoin Nicaraguan society. But
the rebels insist democracy must be instituted in Nicaragua before
they will give up fighting.
   In the meantime, both sides have hardened their positions.
   The Contras elected a new, more conservative leadership to guide
them. The Sandinistas closed the Catholic radio station
indefinitely and shut down La Prensa for 15 days. They also jailed
dozens of Contra leaders, while expelling U.S. Ambassador Richard
Melton and seven other American diplomats.

<TEXT>
   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk said Saturday that chances for peace in his country are
``very slim,'' but Vietnam's foreign minister said peace talks last
week broke an impasse in the conflict.
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach's optimistic comments on the
talks in Indonesia were reported by the official Vietnam News
Agency.
   Sihanouk, who spoke to reporters after arriving in Beijing from
Bangkok, blamed both Vietnam _ which backs the Cambodian government
_ and the Khmer Rouge _ the largest group in the three-party
resistance coalition _ for blocking peace efforts.
   Sihanouk said the Khmer Rouge was the ``biggest obstacle'' to a
settlement of the 9-year-old Cambodian conflict. But he said the
Khmer Rouge would have to be included in a future Cambodian
government.
   ``You cannot reject them.... Nobody is capable of wiping out the
Khmer Rouge, so we have to try to make them less and less dangerous
by including them in a quadrapartite government,'' he said.
   Thach, who attended the meeting of Cambodia's warring factions
in Bogor, Indonesia, said the talks ended amid bitter clashes but
also some convergence of views.
   In an interview with the Vietnam News Agency, Thach said that
for the first time, all parties in the conflict agreed that the two
pivotal issues in resolving the conflict were the withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and eliminating danger from the
Khmer Rouge.
   The talks included Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and
representatives of the resistance, as well as Vietnam, Laos and
representatives of the six-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations.
   Sihanouk also met last week with representatives of the warring
factions in Jakarta, Indonesia. The prince, who last month resigned
as president of the three-party resistance coalition, did not
attend the peace talks in Bogor.
   He said before departing from Indonesia on Friday that the talks
had been a success.
   But when asked about the prospects for peace after Indonesia, he
said they were ``very slim. That's the reason why I am going to
meet again with Hun Sen'' in Paris in October.
   He said that if the four warring factions, including Hun Sen,
agreed that Vietnam should end its military occupation of Cambodia,
``Vietnam would have no pretext to stay in Cambodia.''
   Vietnam has pledged to withdraw its estimated 120,000 troops by
1990, but has demanded that the Khmer Rouge be disarmed and not
play a role in a future Cambodian government.
   The prince said in his meetings with government official in
Beijing that he would not make any demands on the Chinese, who
supply the Khmer Rouge with military and financial support.
   At the talks in Indonesia, all parties agreed for the need to
put into place a political solution to end a conflict which began
in 1979 following the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. Since then,
the three-party resistance, including the Khmer Rouge, has been
fighting Hanoi's forces and the government in Phnom Penh.
   But Thach has opposed proposals for an international armed force
that would disarm the warring factions, including the Khmer Rouge,
who some fear will return to power once Hanoi's forces are
withdrawn.
   ``Only the Cambodian people, victims of the genocidal (Khmer
Rouge) clique, can disarm (them),'' he said in the interview. ``No
foreign force whatever can disarm the Pol Pot force.''
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to end the Khmer Rouge's
three years in power, during which they killed hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians.

Guilt</HEAD>

   The Foreign Ministry said Saturday
that the decision to pay damages to the family of a leftist student
who disappeared while in police custody is not an admission of
guilt.
   It issued a statement saying the payment would be made out of
respect for the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.
   The court on Friday, after eight months of hearings and
deliberations, ruled that Honduras was responsible for the death of
student leader Angel Manfredo Velasquez, 35, and must pay damages
to his family.
   Presidential spokesman Lisando Quesada refused to say how much
the government would pay.
   Two witnesses in the case were shot to death in January and
human human rights groups blamed the killings on rightist death
squads.
   Velasquez was a student at the National University's college of
economics when police arrested him Sept. 8, 1981, during the
military government of Gen. Policapo Paz Garcia.
   He was never seen again.
   Student and labor organizations protested his disappearance.
Several armed groups briefly invaded radio stations, newspapers and
news agencies to demand an investigation.
   The ruling was the first by the court, an Organization of
American States agency. Its seven international jurists are hearing
other cases of Central Americans who disappeared while in police
custody or allegedly suffered human rights abuses.
   The Foriegn Ministery statement said the government did not feel
the evidence produced in the Velasquez trial proved Honduras was
guilty in the disappearance. It said it ``hopes its dignified
example will be an incentive to other nations to adhere to human
rights accords and accept the jurisdiction of the court.''
   Honduras' independent Human Rights Commission says 150 people
have disappeared in Honduras after being picked up by security
forces over the past eight years and about 800 people have been
slain in political killings.
   Amnesty International, the London-based rights organization,
reported in February that death squads linked to the Honduran
military are waging a new campaign of torture and terror against
government opponents.
   Amnesty said arbitrary arrests and torture of prisoners are
widespread.
   Honduras returned to civilian rule in 1982 after a decade of
military governments. But President Jose Azcona Hoyo's civilian
administration remains dependent on the support of the armed forces.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis blamed the
Reagan administration Saturday for the Pentagon contracting uproar,
quoting an old Greek saying that ``the fish rots from the head
first.''
   ``It starts from the top,'' the Democratic presidential nominee
said.
   Dukakis stepped up his assault on President Reagan and Vice
President George Bush, his certain Republican opponent in the fall,
at a stop in Louisville, Ky., where he spoke to about 5,000 people
at a large outdoor rally in a downtown plaza.
   Dukakis was concluding a seven-state tour with stops in two
tobacco states, Kentucky and North Carolina, before returning home
to Boston Saturday night.
   Bush, who is pondering the selection of a running mate and
awaiting nomination at the Republican National Convention in New
Orleans in two weeks, did not campaign Saturday.
   In Chicago, Jesse Jackson said his unsuccessful presidential bid
was a victory for America's disenfranchised, opening the political
process and blazing a trail that would lead one day to a black
occupying the White House.
   In his first public appearance since the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta, Jackson told an overflow gathering at
Operation PUSH, the civil-rights organization he helped found,
Jackson also called Dukakis
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   a
``viable alternative'' to Bush.
   Jackson drew a hearty ovation when he said, ``Dukakis pledged to
not bring shame to the White House. Bush does not recognize shame
at the White House.''
   Dukakis attacked sharply on the Pentagon procurement problem
when questioned about this at a news conference following his
Louisville rally with Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and Sen,
Wendell Ford.
   Dukakis said the alleged bribery and other abuses in connection
with the awarding of defense contracts seemed to be
``fundamentally'' a problem of people rather than process. The
Reagan administration's approach to public service was to blame, he
said.
   ``If you're going to have an administration that takes integrity
and honesty and effective management seriously, that begins at the
top,'' he said. ``If an administration comes to Washington with a
contempt for public service, we shouldn't be surprised that the
people it attracts in government share that contempt, who look at
government service as something that you do for a year and a half
or two before you go out and make a half a million dollars.''
   Asked if he blamed Reagan and Bush personally for alleged
misdeeds by Pentagon contractors, consultants and administrators,
Dukakis responded:
   ``There's an old Greek saying, and I suspect the Italians have
the same one: `You know, the fish rots from the head first.' It
starts from the top.''
   The son of Greek immigrants, Dukakis frequently uses Greek
phrases and speaks in Greek before audiences with similar
backgrounds.
   Under investigation are allegations that defense contractors and
consultants, many of them former military men, bribed Pentagon
officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning
contracts worth billions of dollars.
   Dukakis had attacked the Republicans on the Pentagon problem in
speeches through the Midwest a day earlier, saying he would not
``surrender our national security to greed and corruption.''
   At the news conference, he said he did not expect the president
to know everyting going on in his administration. But he said if
the president picks good people and moves quickly to dismiss any
who violate ethical standards, ``this kind of problem is less
likely to fester and grow and become almost an epidemic in your
administration, which is what's happened.''
   Dukakis also jabbed at Bush in his speech, saying if elected he
would be ``our nation's No. 1 advocate'' for education, ``not just
in an election year but every year.''
   That was a reference to Bush's claim to want to be ``the
education president.''
   While in Kentucky, a state dependent on both coal and tobacco,
Dukakis expressed support for greater use of coal for producing
electricity. He also voiced support for the federal tobacco price
support program in its current form, which is designed to support
itself from fees charged to farmers, and said he supported using
general tax dollars to compensate tobacco growers hit by drought.
   When asked about tobacco, however, Dukakis first replied by
saying he would try to get his wife Kitty ``to rid herself of the
habit'' of smoking. He quickly added, ``I'm just kidding.''
   Dukakis also repeated his vow to make no concessions to
terrorists to gain release of hostages, such as those being held in
Lebanon. ``The consequences will be incalculable,'' he said.
   ``You use diplomacy but you never ever make concessions,'' he
said.
   Later in Raleigh, N.C., Dukakis spoke to about 4,000 people
inside a sweltering State Fairgrounds arena and repeated the themes
he stressed throughout his seven-state, three-day campaign swing:
investing public and private money to create new jobs, improved
education, and affordable child care for working parents.
   He called for more aid for college students and said ``that
support should include our historically black colleges and
universities as well,'' noting that Jesse Jackson attended North
Carolina A&T State University, one of the state's predominantly
black institutions.
   Dukakis met privately with former North Carolina leaders of the
Jackson and Albert Gore Jr. campaigns in the state. In a gesture of
unity, Dukakis joined upraised hands with prominent state leaders
of those campaigns, former U.S. Attorney H.M. Michaux and former
Gov. Jim Hunt, as well as with the candidate for governor, Lt. Gov.
Bob Jordan.
   During the meeting, Dukakis said, ``I can honestly say to you
that I don't recall when there has been more genuine unity in the
Democratic Party than we have right now.'' A short time later, he
said that ``we want to involve every single one of you in this
effort.''
   Dukakis was met in Louisville and Raleigh with small groups of
protesters, most carrying anti-abortion or Bush signs, just as he
has at nearly every stop since leaving the convention in Atlanta.
Dukakis said he was unbothered. ``It's democracy,'' he said.

Leonardo da Vinci Airport, is expected to seek U.S. asylum.
   But he said through a translator that the Soviet Union had no
right ``to deprive me of Armenian citizenship,'' and he would ``try
to return'' to his native land to fight for the rights of Armenians.
   Ayrikyan, 39, arrived by plane from Ethiopia, which had accepted
him after Soviet authorities banished him July 21.
   The Armenian nationalist served 17 years in a Soviet prison
until his release last year after the Kremlin reviewed political
sentencings. But he was jailed again March 25 after he told Western
journalists about the unrest in the Soviet republic of Armenia.
   Soviet authorities banished him after charging him with slander.
   Ayrikyan, wearing a gray suit, was met in Rome by his cousin,
Sylva Ayrikyan, now living in France, and by a representative of
the U.S. Embassy.
   The dissident received a seven-day Italian visa, but ``nothing
is determined'' about his immediate plans, according to a French
lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity and said he represented
members of Ayrikyan's family living in France.
   While in Ethiopia, Ayrikyan said his immediate wishes were to
visit his family in France, then head to the United States and
settle in the Los Angeles area.
   Ayrikyan said in Rome that he and other dissidents were fighting
for human rights in the Soviet Union and that he had not violated
any laws.
   The dissident said thousands of Armenians had written letters to
the Soviet government demanding his return.
   Ayrikyan provoked Soviet officials when he provided news to
Western reporters in Moscow about the campaign in the republic of
Armenia to annex the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is
part of the neighboring Azerbaijan republic.
   More than three-quarters of the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh
are Armenian.
   Following a harsh speech by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
against ethnic nationalism, the Kremlin said July 18 that the
disputed region will remain in Azerbaijan.

   Jesse Jackson said Saturday his unsuccessful
presidential bid was a victory for America's disenfranchised,
opening the political process and blazing a trail that would lead
one day to a black occupying the White House.
   In his first public appearance since the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta, Jackson told an overflow gathering at
Operation PUSH, the civil-rights organization he helped found,
``Victory is expanding the party and the process. ... Losing is
being locked out.''
   ``What did it mean when my children stood there'' on the DNC
platform? ``It meant that your children stood there too. It means
that in 1992 or 1996, I may or may not get there, but our children
will get there in our lifetime.''
   Jackson called Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis a ``viable
alternative'' to Republican Vice President George Bush, drawing a
hearty ovation when he said, ``Dukakis pledged to not bring shame
to the White House. Bush does not recognize shame at the White
House.''
   He repeated many of the same themes he sounded in his rousing
DNC speech, saying the breadth of his influence could be measured
by the inclusion in the party platform of planks calling for
greater investment in the nation's cities and schools, affordable
housing, and a declaration that South Africa is a ``terrorist
state.''
   ``We are changing both parties. Bush now follows our lead with
his attack on drugs. He has moved away from Mrs. Reagan and the
astrologers and just saying `no.' Now Bush follows our lead with a
budget commitment to day care,'' said Jackson.
   ``Now Bush, with the `sleaze factor' of the Reagan
administration, calls for an ethics committee.''
   Still sounding at times like a candidate, Jackson reminded his
supporters that the momentum built during his campaign, the funds
and issues that were raised and the voters registered, must not be
wasted.
   ``Dukakis or Bush will be our president in 1988. Those choices
will change or expand in our lifetime. We're just an attitude away
from winning the nomination. We have the votes, we're gaining the
experience,'' he said.
   ``The issue will not be who chooses us for the ticket, but it
will be who we choose,'' Jackson added. ``Through hard work, we
will win.''
   ``Politics is not a one-round fight. It is not an even fight.
Sometimes, referees, judges and even the rules are stacked against
you,'' said Jackson. ``You cannot surrender, have a thin skin or a
glass jaw. You have to hang in there.''

   Iran said Saturday that its troops drove
Iraqi soldiers occupying four towns back to the border and blunted
a new Iraqi offensive elsewhere. Iraq said it withdrew from
occupied areas.
   The Iraqis seized the western Iranian areas in a week of
fighting that followed Iran's announcement July 18 that it would
accept a cease-fire in the eight-year war.
   In reports monitored in Nicosia, Iran said Iraqi forces
chemically bombed a village just inside the border near the town of
Marivan in northwestern Iran. It reported Iraqi shelling of
villages near Sardasht in the same region.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said 10 civilians
were wounded when chemical bombs were dropped on the village of
Bilo.
   The agency said Iraqi conventional shells wounded 40 civilians
and damaged several houses in 10 villages around Sardasht in the
mountainous northwest.
   Iraq denied shelling Sardasht and made no comment on the
chemical bomb report.
   In its daily military communique in Baghdad, Iraq on Saturday
reported massive air strikes against Iranian positions all along
the warfront.
   The communique said Iraqi jetfighters carried out 125 combat
missions and its helicopter gunships flew 89 sorties, inflicting
``considerable losses on the enemy in men, equipment and weapons.''
   Iran said its forces liberated the towns of Karand, Amirabad,
Qasr-e Shirin and Sar-e Pol-e Zahab in the central front, pushing
Iraqi troops back to the border.
   But a military spokesman, quoted by the official Iraqi News
Agency, said Iraqi forces had pulled out of the towns it occupied
in the central front. The spokesman said Iraqi forces had pulled
out of Qasr-e Shirin, Sumar and Amirabad.
   Tehran radio, also monitored in Cyprus, said Iraqi forces
launched an attack a little farther south, around the town of
Mehran on the south-central war front. It said they were pushed
back.
   ``A heavy battle is raging in the area and our Moslem combatants
have forced the Iraqis to retreat,'' the radio said.
   On Friday, Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's acting commander in chief,
said Iraqi forces and Iranian rebels advanced 65 miles into Iran
before Iran pushed them back toward the border.
   Speaking at a prayer service broadcast Friday on Tehran radio,
Rafsanjani said Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels had entered a hospital
in the western town of Eslamabad and ``rained bullets on some 30
patients,'' killing all of them.
   Iran said it drove the rebel fighters out of Eslamabad and
Karand, 60 miles inside Iran, killing or wounding 4,500 invaders in
a ``heavy battle'' against ``forces of the Baghdad regime and their
hypocritical mercenaries.''
   Iranian news reports, monitored in Nicosia, said more than 1,000
Iraqi tanks and personnel carriers were either destroyed or seized
in the fighting. ``The operation destroyed the Islamic republic's
cancer, which ... could have caused problems for Iranians,''
Rafsanjani told the prayer congregation in Tehran in an apparent
reference to the rebels.
   The rebel group, in a communique released in Baghdad, said its
fighters returned to their bases Friday after killing or wounding
40,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards in three days of fighting.
   No independent observers were allowed near the fighting and
claims from both sides could not be verified.

   Thunderstorms developed Saturday around the lower Great Lakes
and over parts of the South, sections of Missouri got heavy rain,
and record heat returned to the Northeast.
   By early afternoon, thunderstorms extended around the lakes from
southeastern Wisconsin and southern Lower Michigan across western
New York state and the Ohio Valley.
   Wind gusted to about 60 mph over Lake Erie and to 70 mph near
Dansville, N.Y. Wind and hail damaged trees in parts of Ohio and
western New York, the National Weather Service said.
   Thunderstorms also developed over the Tennessee Valley, Georgia,
Alabama, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico coast.
   Wind gusts during storms damaged power lines and telephone lines
near Swansea, S.C., the weather service said.
   In Missouri, thunderstorms from Friday evening into Saturday
morning left 3.20 inches of rain at Kearney, 2.68 inches at
Richmond and 2.65 inches at Lexington.
   Showers also were scattered over north-central New Mexico,
southwestern Arizona and southeastern California.
   Temperatures climbed higher than normal across the Northeast and
Baltimore hit a record 102 downtown. Other records were 92 at
Bridgeport, Conn.; 98 at Hartford, Conn.; and Philadelphia tied its
record of 98.
   Elsewhere, Lander, Wyo., hit a record high of 96.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 61
degrees at Port Angeles, Wash., and San Simeon, Calif., to 103 at
Rapid City, S.D. The low Saturday morning was 42 degrees at
Jackson, Wyo.
   For Sunday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from New
England across the Appalachians, over Florida, along the Texas Gulf
Coast, and from the southern Rockies across Arizona.
   Highs near 80 or in the 80s were predicted in northern New
England and much of the Great Lakes, scattered over the southern
Rockies into northern Arizona, and along the Pacific Coast; around
100 from central Texas across central Kansas, as well as over the
Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah; near 110 across the desert
Southwest; and in the 90s or near 90 in the remainder of the nation.

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Hussein on Saturday dissolved the
lower house of Parliament, half of whose 60 members come from the
Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River, in a move linked to
the Palestinian uprising.
   The monarch's action had been expected after the announcement
Thursday that Jordan planned to step aside to give the Palestine
Liberation Organization a greater voice in the affairs of the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Jordanian officials said all Jordanian-Palestinian institutions
in the West Bank were under review. The PLO wants a greater role in
the occupied territories where Palestinians have been rioting
against Israeli control since December.
   Also Thursday, Hussein canceled a five-year, $1.3-billion
development plan for educational and economic projects in the West
Bank and Gaza strip.
   The king signed a decree dissolving the Chamber of Deputies, the
lower house of Parliament, and announced he will address the
country Sunday night to outline his new policies.
   In Jerusalem, a Foreign Ministry official called the dissolution
of the Chamber of Deputies a ``peripheral'' move that leaves most
Jordanian-West Bank ties intact. He said it would have no immediate
impact on Israeli policy.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``There
are other things that really bind Hussein to the territories, and
if he doesn't take these steps he isn't really cutting himself
off.'' He said other links included Jordan's funding of West Bank
teachers.
   But Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini, a PLO supporter who
directs the Arab Studies Institute in east Jerusalem, said Hussein
was sending a clear message to the Israelis and Americans.
   ``These steps ... mean that everything must be transferred to
the PLO and the PLO must be responsible for everything here,'' he
said. ``Hussein is sending a message that there is no Jordanian
option, there is no way but the Palestinian option through the
PLO.''
   Israel has said it will not negotiate with the PLO, which it
considers a terrorist organization, but it would discuss peace with
a joint delegation of Jordanians and non-PLO Palestinians. The
United States generally has supported the Israeli stand.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Few members of Jordan's Parliament wanted to comment on the
decree until they heard Hussein's speech.
   But one member of the lower house expressed distress over the
apparent decision to break away from the local affairs of
Palestinians in the West Bank.
   ``I feel sorry that such a step was carried out at this moment
in the history of the Palestinian uprising,'' said Carlos Dihmis,
the representative from the West Bank city of Bethlehem.
   Information Minister Hani Khasawneh said ``a consultative
council might replace the lower house within the next few days.''
   Under the constitution the monarch has the power to dissolve the
Chamber of Deputies. All 30 members of the Senate are appointed by
royal decree and support the king's policies.
   The West Bank was given 30 representatives in the Chamber of
Deputies despite the division after the 1967 war.
   In 1974, the lower house was abolished following the Rabat
summit recognized the PLO as the only legitimate representative of
the world's 5 million Palestinians.
   A national consultative council with 80 members was established
in 1978 and served until January 1984 when a royal decree restored
the Chamber of Deputies. All Jordanian citizens vote for the 30
members of Parliament from Jordan and those legislators then elect
the 30 members from the West Bank. Most Palestinians in Jordan and
the West Bank have Jordanian citizenship.

   A bomb exploded at a crowded
shopping center in a white suburb of Johannesburg on Saturday,
killing a woman and injuring 56 people, eight of them seriously,
police said.
   Authorities said most of the victims were white. The blast
occurred one day after ``Cry Freedom,'' the film about black
activist Steven Biko, was banned by the government just seven hours
after theaters began showing it.
   The noon explosion at the main shopping center in Benoni, 12
miles east of Johannesburg, was the fifth in two days in South
Africa.
   Police spokesman Lt. Willem Meyer said nine people were
critically or seriously injured in the Benoni blast, which was
caused by a limpet mine. He said one of them, a white woman, died
later at a hospital.
   There was no immediate claim of resonsibility, but Adriaan Vlok,
the Minister of Law and Order, blamed the African National
Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting the white-led
government.
   The bombing ``is convincing proof that the ANC viewed all the
inhabitants of South Africa as its enemies, and based its hope on
violence only,'' Vlok said in a statement.
   The explosion occurred inside a fast-food restaurant, which was
extensively damaged, Meyer said. Other shops suffered lesser
damage, and windows were shattered throughout the two-story plaza
of small shops and cafes, Meyer said.
   The plaza was packed with shoppers, most of them white,
witnesses and police said.
   Authorities have blamed the ANC for virtually all of the more
than 90 bombings in South Africa during a state of emergency
imposed 25 months ago to quell unrest. The ANC, based in Lusaka,
Zambia, seldom confirms or denies any involvement in the attacks.
   It is fighting to end the government's policy of apartheid,
under which the black majority has no voice in national affairs.
   Saturday's blast came less than 24 hours after the government
banned ``Cry Freedom'' on grounds it contributed to the
``revolutionary climate'' in South Africa. The movie tells the
story of Biko, who died in police detention in 1977, and Donald
Woods, a white journalist who befriended him.
   Government censors approved the movie Friday morning and it
immediately began playing at 30 theaters nationwide. However,
police on Friday evening seized the film from the cinemas.
   During the seven hours the movie was screened, there were
explosions, but no injuries, at theaters in Durban, the Alexandra
township outside Johannesburg, and the southern city of Port
Elizabeth. Police also defused a bomb in the restroom of a cinema
in Roodepoort, just west of Johannesburg.
   ```Cry Freedom' endangers the safety of the public, the
maintenance of public order and will delay the termination of the
state of emergency,'' said Gen. Hendrik de Witt, commissioner of
police.
   Police in Pretoria discovered an explosive device Saturday at
the Metro theater complex, where ``Cry Freedom'' was shown Friday.
Police cordoned off the area and bomb experts defused the device,
police said.
   Also, police said one person was slightly injured Saturday
morning when a limpet mine exploded at a bus stop in Germiston, a
town nine miles southeast of Johannesburg.
   Elsewhere, prison authorities said one black inmate was killed
and three white prison guards injured during a hostage-taking
episode that lasted several hours at the Goedemoed Prison near
Aliwal North, more than 300 miles south of Johannesburg.
   About 10 prisoners overpowered guards at breakfast Saturday,
stabbing three of them and taking one hostage, said W.H. Willemse,
commissioner of prisons.
   The inmates demanded to see high-ranking government officials
and journalists, Willemse said. However, guards stormed the
prisoners after several hours, rescuing the hostage and killing one
inmate, Willemse added.
   About 1,800 black and mixed-race prisoners are held at Goedemoed
Prison, officials said.
   In other developments, seven blacks were killed in five separate
attacks in Natal province and the Soweto township outside
Johannesburg, police said in their daily unrest report.
   The sketchy unrest statement covers incidents reported during
the previous 24 hours, but gives few details.
   One man was fatally stabbed and three seriously injured when
they were attacked by black students in Soweto, the statement said.
   In Natal, the site of ongoing black factional fighting, three
men were stabbed to death when a group of blacks attacked a home,
police said.
   In two other incidents in Natal, a group of blacks stabbed a
woman to death and a man was fatally stabbed in an attack on a
private home, police said. Also in Natal, a private vehicle was set
afire, killing the only occupant, police said.

   Two men and four teen-agers were
arraigned Saturday on charges they kidnapped and beat a man, then
terrorized him with a game of Russian roulette before releasing him.
   The 20-year-old victim allegedly owed one of the attackers
$1,500.
   The suspects, who range in age from 15 to 25, pleaded innocent
to assault charges in the July 23 attack, said Detective Sgt. Jim
Powers of the Suffolk County Police Department. They were arrested
Friday night.
   Additional charges of kidnapping and reckless endangerment were
being reviewed by the Suffolk County district attorney's office,
said Thomas Blomberg, chief of detectives.
   The victim's name was withheld and he was placed in protective
custody because one of the suspects was on parole for attempted
murder of a New York City police officer, said Powers.
   The victim was abducted at gunpoint while walking down a street
in Huntington Station on Long Island. He was driven to the back
yard of an abandoned house, where he was forced to disrobe and
kneel on the ground.
   The attackers pistol-whipped, kicked and beat the man, breaking
his nose and jaw, then ``held a gun to his head and forced him to
endure a game of Russian roulette,'' said Powers.
   No weapon was recovered and police were unsure whether the gun
used in the alleged roulette game was loaded, Officer Thomas
Sorriano said.

   The Town Council on Saturday lifted an
emergency curfew imposed after the young people rioted and marched
on the police station to protest underage drinking arrests, the
mayor said.
   Mayor Charles Moll ordered a dusk-to-dawn curfew for groups on
the streets after about 50 young people smashed windows and marched
on the police station Thursday night. He also asked the
Pennsylvania National Guard to be ready if police were unable to
control the crowd.
   ``We hope that everything is going back to normal,'' Moll said.
``We felt the emergency was over. We'll have to see what happens.''
   Thursday's disturbance in this north-central Pennsylvania town
of 1,300 was seen by some as the culmination of months of tension
between police and young people who gather on the town's main
thoroughfare.
   ``All they want to do is loaf on the main street,'' Moll said
after the riot. ``There's drugs, there's drink, there's sex.''
   Tensions flared late Thursday when officers attempted to arrest
a 17-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man for drinking and they
resisted arrest, police said.
   Six people were charged with participating in a riot.

   The Communist Party set deadlines for overhauling
the party, government and judiciary to speed Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reform program, according to resolutions announced Saturday by Tass.
   The resolutions involve key issues the 57-year-old Soviet leader
outlined in a speech Friday at a one-day meeting of the 300-plus
member party Central Committee.
   Tass, the official news agency, reported the Central Committee
resolutions, passed after Gorbachev's speech, commit the party and
government to the timetable Gorbachev had sought.
   The first deadline is October when a draft law on amendments to
the constitution and on multi-candidate elections of legislators is
to be finished. The Supreme Soviet, or parliament, will then review
the proposals.
   By year's end, the 20-million-member party is to have
reorganized, pruning itself to include only ``politically mature,
well-prepared Communists possessing high moral qualities and
capable of organizing work in a new way.''
   Gorbachev, the party's general secretary, told the Central
Committee Friday, ``I want to repeat again and again, comrades,
that the time of vigorous action has come and we must not tarry.''
   He said the reorganized party ``should be totally relieved of
administrative-managerial functions and concentrate its work on the
key directions of home and foreign policy and shift the center of
gravity to political methods of guidance.''
   Tass reported these other timetables:
   Elections are to be held in March for 2,250 representatives to a
new body, the Congress of Peoples' Deputies, that will meet the
following month. The first business of the Congress will be to vote
for a new parliament of at least 400 members and for a Soviet
president.
   The new parliament is to draft laws promised long ago on the
rights of youths and trade unions and the role of the press,
according to the resolutions as reported by Tass.
   In the party, the ruling Politburo is to complete by early 1989
proposals on an explosive issue in Soviet society _ relations among
the country's more than 100 nationalities. The proposals will then
go before the policy-making Central Committee for a session on
ethnic relations.
   By the middle of l989, a revamping of the roles of judges,
prosecutors, lawyers and investigators is to be completed.
Gorbachev, a law school graduate, has said the legal system must be
improved to prevent a repeat of the repression suffered under
former Soviet leader Josef Stalin and the corruption that existed
under the leadership of Leonid I. Brezhnev.

<HEAD>Contract Talks Collapse, Strikers Plan To Picket `Roger Rabbit'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contract talks between scriptwriters and
movie and television producers collapsed Saturday, erasing earlier
optimism that weekend talks might end the 21-week-old,
industry-crippling strike.
   Striking scriptwriters immediately pledged to picket theaters
showing the hit film ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' a move to target
Walt Disney Studios.
   Representatives from the Writers Guild of America and the
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers left the
bargaining table in the early morning hours Saturday without a
settlement in the strike, which has halted most Hollywood
production.
   Federal mediator Floyd Wood declared the meetings adjourned,
calling negotiations deadlocked.
   Guild writers scheduled informational picketing Sunday at two of
the largest theaters in Los Angeles, said union spokeswoman Cheryl
Rhoden.
   ``We'll take our message to the public,'' Ms. Rhoden said. ``And
we're targeting `Roger Rabbit' because it's a Disney venture and
Disney has maintained a continuous hard-line position.''
   The producers planned a Sunday news conference, spokesman Herb
Steinberg said.
   Guild officials said they hoped the mediator can get both sides
back to the bargaining table soon, but Steinberg said the
mediator's efforts failed and producers will go ahead with
preparations for a fall television season with whatever writers are
available.
   ``There are no new plans for any further meetings or
discussions, formal, informal, or otherwise,'' Steinberg said.
``Things aren't looking good for a settlement any time soon.''
   Negotiators deadlocked on several issues, with domestic and
foreign television rerun payments topping the list, Ms. Rhoden
said. Steinberg said contention over rerun money from foreign
broadcasts plagued the talks.
   The strike began when more than 9,000 guild members walked off
the job March 7. Despite some internal dissension, the union
rank-and-file has overwhelmingly rejected each contract proposal
offered by producers.
   With the fall TV network schedules in a shambles, producers say
they will reshoot old scripts from canceled shows, using new actors.
   The latest week-long round of talks was held at alliance offices
in Sherman Oaks, about 10 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Thatcher Hopes for Better Relations with Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the brother
of captive church envoy Terry Waite, in a letter released Saturday,
that she wants Britain to build on recent hopeful signs in its
relations with Iran.
   However, the Conservative leader also said Britain should make
no concessions for release of hostages.
   She made the comments in a letter to David Waite, dated July 27.
It was released by Lambeth Palace in London, the headquarters of
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie.
   The Church of England leader sent Terry Waite to Lebanon to seek
release of American hostages held there, but the Anglican envoy
disappeared Jan. 20, 1987. He is believed held by pro-Iranian
Shiite extremists.
   In her letter, the prime minister welcomed Iran's July 18
decision to accept a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   She added: ``I hope that we can now work together to remove the
obstacles to a better relationship.''
   Britain has limited diplomatic relations with Tehran, with no
British diplomats stationed in the Iranian capital.
   ``Hostage-taking is a crime and anyone with influence over
hostage-takers should use this to help secure their release,'' she
said. ``If the Iranian government is in a position to exert
influence towards this humanitarian objective, we look to it to do
so.''
   The prime minister added: ``I know you agree that the government
should not make concessions to secure the release of hostages, and
I respect your view all the more against the background of distress
which you and your family continue to suffer.''
   David Waite said he welcomed the letter. He said Saturday on
behalf of the Waite family: ``Of course there are problems to be
solved between Britain and Iran. But Mrs. Thatcher's assurance that
good will will be reciprocated is very good news.''
   Kidnappers are believed to hold 18 Westerners, including 9
Americans, hostage in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Saturday in Manama, Bahrain, Mrs. Thatcher said Britain was
prepared to call for a meeting of the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council to help bring peace to the Persian Gulf.
   The prime minister was on a 12-day trip that will include stops
in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Australia.

<TEXT>
   Ireland's population has dropped for the
first time in 27 years because of mass emigration by young people
seeking work abroad, the government's Central Statistics Office
reported Saturday.
   Ireland's population is estimated to be 3,538,000, or 5,000
fewer people than in April 1987, the office said.
   ``The reason for the net decline in population is emigration,''
it said in a statement.
   Ireland, beset by high taxes and 17 percent unemployment, has
experienced its biggest wave of emigration since the 1920s. An
estimated 25,000 to 30,000 people leave each year.
   The government estimates about 40,000 to 50,000 young Irish have
gone to the United States in the past seven years in search of
better conditions, many as illegal aliens.

   The government oil company chief who became a
symbol of the corruption of the high-rolling oil boom years was
freed from prison Saturday after serving five years for fraud.
   Mariachi music and scores of supporters, many in tears, greeted
Jorge Diaz Serrano when he walked out the gates of the Southern
Penitentiary arm-in-arm with his wife and flanked by his children
and lawyers.
   A circuit court in March reduced his 10-year sentence to five,
saying the 67-year-old former Pemex chief was smart, capable and
posed no danger to society. The Supreme Court upheld the reduced
sentence July 18.
   Diaz Serrano, an ex-senator, proclaimed his innocence Saturday,
as he has from the outset. He told reporters he planned to devote
himself to business and politics.
   ``I am returning to freedom, but not because there has been
justice,'' he said.
   President Miguel de la Madrid made the cases of Diaz Serrano and
former Mexico City police chief Arturo Durazo Moreno centerpieces
of his ``moral renovation'' campaign in the early 1980s.
   With the de la Madrid administration winding to a close, the
extortion case against the former police chief is still pending.
   Diaz Serrano was convicted in 1983 of embezzling $34 million
from Pemex through a gas tanker deal.
   In the 1980 deal, a Liberian-based firm, Navigas International,
bought two natural gas tankers from the Belgian shipbuilder
Boelwerf for $124 million. It then immediately sold them to Pemex
for $158 million.
   Diaz Serrano was convicted of pocketing the difference.
   He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined the equivalent
of $58 million.
   Diaz Serrano headed the government oil company from 1976 to
1981, the oil boom years of former President Jose Lopez Portillo.
   After leaving Pemex, Diaz Serrano was elected senator from the
northern state of Sonora. Congress later stripped him of
legislative immunity from prosecution.
   Defense lawyer Enrique Mendoza Morales said Diaz Serrano cannot
pay the $58 million fine but cannot be held in prison under Mexican
law for that reason.
   Mendoza Morales said the government has confiscated about a $1
million in assets from Diaz Serrano, including property in the
resort cities of Cuernavaca and Acapulco and an art collection.
   A minor charge of criminal association is still pending against
Diaz Serrano, who paid $4,350 bail to get out of prison, his lawyer
said.

<TEXT>
   A 74-year-old Alabama man who left home on
an hourlong drive to the dentist was found lost and confused 17
hours later _ about 600 miles from home.
   Frank Collier, of Centreville, Ala., was stopped by police
Friday night on Indiana 332 west of this central Indiana city. He
told police he left home at 5 a.m. Friday for a dentist's
appointment north of Birmingham.
   ``It has been one of the strangest things I've ever been
involved with,'' said Delaware County police officer Dan Hahn.
``I've been a policeman for 10 years and never had anything like
this. It's a miracle he ever made it up here.''
   Hahn and his partner, Dave McDonald, were patrolling on Indiana
332 about 10:15 p.m. Friday when they spotted a car heading west in
the eastbound lane. They stopped the car by blocking the road.
   ``I went up to the car and asked the gentleman if he knew where
he was going,'' said Hahn, who still was shaking his head a couple
of hours later while relating the details.
   ``He very politely replied, `I sure do, sir, I'm going to
Centreville ... Centreville, Alabama.'''
   Centreville is in central Alabama, about 25 miles southwest of
Birmingham and about 600 miles from Muncie.
   Collier told Hahn and McDonald he had an appointment to get a
partial dental plate fitted, but couldn't find his dentist's office
so he turned around to head home.
   Instead, police believe, Collier wound up on Interstate 65, a
major north-south route that runs from Chicago to Mobile, Ala.
Collier stopped to buy gasoline in Indianapolis, about 60 miles
southwest of Muncie, Hahn said.
   ``When he stopped in Indianapolis, he apparently asked for
directions,'' Hahn said. ``There was a gas receipt where someone
had written some directions to get out of Indianapolis. He made it
out of Indianapolis, but he wound up here instead of heading
south.''
   From Indianapolis, I-65 continues northwest toward Lafayette and
Chicago. Muncie does not lie along the interstate.
   ``We don't know how in the world he got up here,'' Hahn said.
``And he doesn't either. He thought he was in Alabama and was just
trying to find his way back home.''
   Collier had not been drinking and appeared to be clear-headed,
Hahn said.
   Collier had not eaten since breakfast Friday morning, so jail
officials gave him a meal and arranged for lodging at a motel.
   ``He has been one of the nicest men you'd ever want to meet,''
said Rhonda Williamson, a Ball State University criminal justice
student doing a summer internship, who assisted Hahn and McDonald.
``He was very polite and very sweet. He just got lost.''
   Members of Collier's church, Shiloh Baptist Church in
Centreville, planned to go to Muncie to help Collier get home.

<TEXT>
   Just five days after they were returned to the
National Aquarium after a year elsewhere, three beluga whales got
into some bloody bickering that left two of them with bites and
scrapes.
   Aquarium officials say fighting isn't out of the ordinary for
the species, but these three whales had never fought before
Friday's tiff.
   The three whales had been living together harmoniously for
nearly a year at the New York Aquarium while the Baltimore
aquarium's 260,000-gallon tank underwent a $1 million renovation.
   ``I don't think the move had anything to do with it,'' said Bob
Jenkins, director of operations and husbandry at the aquarium.
   Kia, the youngest whale, was found to have been bitten on the
tail.
   Possibly Kia had been following the other two, Anore and
Illamar, around the tank and one of them turned around and bit her,
Jenkins suggested.
   ``Or maybe they just got up on the wrong side of the tank,'' he
said.
   Then 6-year-old Anore suffered scrapes, probably while keepers
were trying to herd the marine mammals into a shallow area of the
tank.
   Jenkins compared the severity of the wounds with ``your
5-year-old kid with a knee scrape.''
   Aquarium staffers treated the whales' wounds with gauze and
disinfectant.
   ``There will be a little bit of concern of what to do if the
fighting continues,'' he said.
   Anore and Illamar were captured in Hudson Bay in 1985.

   More than 130 singers, dancers,
musicians and actors from a dozen countries are participating in
celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of the end of slavery in
this former British colony.
   Billed as the biggest cultural event since the Caribbean Arts
Festival was staged in Guyana in 1972, artists began three weeks of
performances Friday night.
   After the visiting artists take part in a daylong folk festival
Monday in Georgetown, they will fan out to the rest of this South
American nation of 825,000.
   Twenty-five scholars from Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean
and United States are also holding a three-day conference, entitled
``Genesis of a Nation,'' which ends Sunday. Among the topics
discussed were the impact of African culture on Guyana and the
effect of slavery on the country's black population.
   About 40 percent of Guyanese are black. Most other Guyanese are
of East Indian stock, descendents of indentured servants brought to
this former sugar producing colony after the abolition of slavery
in 1833.
   Friday night's festivities were marked by a power blackout
during the opening show in Georgetown's National Park. President
Desmond Hoyte was among those in the audience when the lights went
out.
   The government set aside a $400,000 budget for the celebrations,
which feature delegations from Nigeria, Venezuela, Suriname,
Jamaica, United States, Britain and several Caribbean island-states.
   Among the participants are South Africa's U.S.-based singer
Miriam Makeba and two calypso singers _ the Mighty Sparrow and the
Mighty Gabby _ of Barbados.

   Texas' largest bank opened Saturday under new
ownership, a North Carolina corporation whose chairman saluted
Dallas billionaire H. Ross Perot for helping seal the deal to take
over the crippled bank.
   NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., acquired First RepublicBank on
Friday in what may evolve into a $4 billion federal rescue, the
largest in banking history. The new bank opened Saturday as NCNB
Texas National Bank.
   ``We believe Mr. Perot's willingness to step forward as an
investor was very important,'' NCNB Chairman Hugh L. McColl Jr.
said Saturday.
   Perot emerged as a key player in the deal when he told the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. that, if needed, he would back
NCNB's venture, tabbed at between $210 million and $240 million.
   ``I agreed to underwrite it, which was an insignificant public
service to the people of Texas because NCNB, without even breaking
a bead of perspiration, can raise well over $200 million,'' said
Perot, who attended a news conference Saturday with NCNB officers.
   The FDIC approved the takeover by NCNB of the Dallas-based First
RepublicBank, which has been struggling since a downturn in the
state's economy. It had posted a loss of nearly $2.3 billion in the
first six months of 1988.
   Timothy P. Hartman, NCNB's chief financial officer, said the
bank probably would finance the deal through the sale of
securities. Under the agreement, NCNB takes control of 20 percent
of the equity of the new bank and 100 percent of the voting common
stock.
   The bank will be split into two divisions to separate operating
bank assets, valued at an estimated $20 billion, and a special
asset pool of troubled assets of about $5 billion, Hartman said.
   The FDIC will absorb costs in resolving the bad assets, he said.
   NCNB officers expressed confidence in the Texas economy despite
depressions in oil, real estate and financial services sectors.
   McColl said the move will give NCNB investors a presence in a
major market with a manageable risk, saying that the economy has
bottomed out in Texas and most signposts in the economy point
toward a steady recovery.
   ``This is a new bank and it's up and running,'' said Francis B.
``Buddy'' Kemp, NCNB president and chairman of NCNB Texas National.
   Kemp said he foresaw no layoffs or management upheavals in the
takeover. The bank has 12,200 employees and 134 banking locations
in the state.

<HEAD>Police Say Three Palestinians Sought Links With Peruvian
Guerrillas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian allegedly connected with the
1985 terrorist attacks in the Rome and Vienna airports and two
comrades have been arrested while trying to form links with
Peruvian guerrillas, police said Saturday.
   The three suspects were presented Saturday to reporters, and
police said they were members of the Abu Nidal Palestinian
terrorist organization.
   Police identified them as Hocine Bouzidi, 36, a Palestinian who
they said had Algerian identity documents; Ahmad Assaad Mohamed,
19, of Lebanon, and Mohamed Abdelrahman Abed, 19, from Egypt.
   ``We are students, not terrorists,'' Abed told the reporters.
   Police Col. Javier Palacios said Interpol has said Bouzidi
helped plan the simultaneous raids in December 1985 at the Rome and
Vienna airports in which 14 people were killed and 120 wounded. He
reported the international police organization also said Bouzidi
was involved in planning the November 1985 hijacking of an Egyptian
jetliner. Egyptian commandos stormed the craft after it landed in
Malta and 59 people died.
   Palacio said Interpol reports named Bouzidi as a Central
Committee member of the Abu Nidal oragnization, a radical group
that split off from the Palestine Liberation Organization and has
been blamed for scores of terrorist attacks in the Middle East and
Europe.
   The PLO issued a statment in Lima Saturday calling the three
suspects ``enemies of the Palestinian revolution.''
   Palacios said the three were arrested July 16 in Lima but it was
not made public until late Friday because of the investigation.
   He said police suspected, but had ``no conclusive proof,'' that
the three men sought connections with Peru's Maoist Shining Path
movement to gain recruits for Abu Nidal and plan joint attacks
against against U.S., Peruvian and Jewish targets in Peru.
   An Interior Ministry communique said joint attacks were planned
against the U.S. Consulate, the Israeli Embassy, the Synagogue of
Israel and the Israeli travel agency Shalom.
   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the three probably would be deported. But he did not say to what
country they might be sent and made no mention of extradition
requests.
   Palacios said police recovered documents showing Bouzidi had
been in Peru 45 days and the two others for seven months.
   Government officials say more than 15,000 people have been
killed in violence related to the Shining Path insurgengy since the
guerrillas began their campaign eight years ago.

<TEXT>
   An Oklahoma boys soccer team en route to a
Brazilian tournament has been stranded in Miami since Thursday, and
Saturday the youngsters set up camp at the airport until they can
board a flight.
   ``This is a nightmare _ a horror movie that travels with
children,'' said Robert L. Daniels, a parent escorting the players,
ages 11 through 15.
   A Pan American World Airways spokesman said Saturday the group
should be on a flight to Brazil no later than Sunday, giving them a
chance to play in five games. The youngsters said they already have
missed several practices and at least one game that was to be
nationally televised in Brazil.
   ``Miami is exciting, sort of,'' said bleary-eyed Rusty Green,
11, of Edmond, Okla. ``But I wish I was in Brazil now. I'm a pretty
good soccer player.''
   The soccer group of about 100 adults and children left Oklahoma
on Thursday, but Pan Am was unable to seat 15 adults and 36
children on the final leg of their trip to Brazil, a flight from
Miami to Sao Paulo.
   Alan Loflin, a Pan Am spokesman in Miami, blamed a high volume
of travelers for the delay. ``This is peak season crunch time,'' he
said. The parents said the group had confirmed tickets, but Loflin
could not verify that.
   Loflin said an extra Boeing 747 non-stop flight to Sao Paulo was
added for Sunday to accommodate the soccer group and other delayed
passengers.
   ``I'm confident we can get them out Sunday at the latest,'' he
said.
   After the soccer entourage was bumped from its flight Thursday,
the group checked into a nearby hotel where rooms are $77 per
night. Daniels said Pan Am would not pay the bill. The group
couldn't get on a flight Friday, either.
   So, rather than watch the boys' spending money ``disappear like
water through a faucet'' on hotel bills and meals, the chaperones
decided Saturday afternoon to check out and set up housekeeping at
the airport.
   ``In the halls, I guess,'' Daniels said as he herded the team
onto an airport shuttle bus.
   Daniels said the boys' disappointment grows each night they
don't leave.
   ``They're bawling and crying and we have kids calling their
parents at 1 a.m. upset,'' Daniels said.
   ``This trip is a big deal to these kids,'' said Kay Green, a
parent from Clinton, Okla. She said the soccer players ``drove
combines and washed cars and did anything'' to raise $1,500 each
for the trip.

<TEXT>
   A government newspaper reported
Saturday that the number of refugees from civil war in Eritrea has
grown over the past six weeks from 6,000 to 80,000.
   The increase comes as government troops are stepping up their
campaign against separatist guerrillas in Eritrea and Tigre,
Ethiopia's northernmost regions. The government banned foreign
relief workers from the area in April, complaining that insurgents
were intercepting their shipments.
   Refugees in Eritrea are living in tents and makeshift shelters
mainly near the towns of Asmara, Keren, Eleberid, Ghinda and
Massawa, according to the weekly Yezarietu Ethiopia.
   The fighting in neighboring Tigre has created another 7,300
refugees, the report said.
   The newspaper said the displaced people in Tigre are living in
makeshift shelters near Mekelle. They have trekked from surrounding
areas in search of food and other help, the newspaper said.
   It said emergency assistance was being provided to 2.6 million
people in both regions.
   More than 12,000 tons of grain and supplementary food was
provided to slightly more than one million Eritreans in June
through 30 distribution centers, the government's Relief and
Rehabilitation Commission was quoted as saying.
   The newspaper said that from March to June about 127,000 tons of
grain and supplementary food and blankets were distributed to 1.5
million people in Tigre.
   The government has been battling insurgents in Eritrea for 27
years and in Tigre for 14 years. It officially acknowledged the
civil wars for the first time in March.
   Millions of Ethiopians driven by drought and civil war have also
fled into neighboring Somalia and Sudan. The government in Sudan,
meanwhile, is fighting its own war, and thousands of Sudanese
refugees have fled into Ethiopia.

<HEAD>Thatcher: Christian Doctrine Not `At Odds' with Anglican Women
Priests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has said she
believes Christian doctrine does not oppose ordaining women as
Anglican priests, a controversial policy for the church of 70
million members.
   Her remarks were criticized by Anglican church officials
attending a church conference debating whether to accept women
bishops. Many Episcopalians object to the minority of priests who
are women.
   ``I personally think there will be women in the priesthood and I
do not myself find it at odds with the Christian doctrine, although
I accept that some people do,'' Mrs. Thatcher told Australian
reporters Friday just before she embarked on a 12-day tour of Asia
and Australia.
   She said however, ``I am not going to get involved in what the
Lambeth Conference decides,'' referring to the three-week
conference which begins its last week Monday with a debate on women
bishops.
   Rev. William Oddie, an Oxford University theologian and leading
opponent against the ordination of women, was quoted in the Sunday
Telegraph newspaper as saying, ``it would have been better if (Mrs.
Thatcher) had stayed out'' of the controversy.
   ``It is a theological question and not a secular one,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``It is a technical question which is outside her
competence.''
   The Bishop of Leicester, the Right Rev. Richard Rutt, told the
Telegraph, ``It is all very well for Mrs. Thatcher to say that the
ordination of women is not against Christian doctrine, but I do not
recall that she has studied theology.''
   The conference in Canterbury has brought together 525 bishops
representing 164 countries, who are meeting for the first time in
10 years.
   Some 1,200 women have been admitted to the priesthood by a
minority of the Anglican churches, most of them in the United
States, Canada and New Zealand. The Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie has warned that although all Anglican churches will probably
accept women priests, a woman bishop _ now under consideration by
Episcopal churches in the United States and New Zealand _ is likely
to split the worldwide Anglican Communion.
   Although the 27 Anglican churches worldwide are self-governing,
they look to the Church of England for guidance and Runcie is the
world Anglican leader.

   Thick fog blanketed sections of the
main highway linking Sao Paulo with Rio de Janeiro and police said
it caused three pileup accidents early Saturday in which 13 people
were killed and 45 injured.
   The accidents involved dozes of cars, trucks and buses and were
near the town of Jacarei, 48 miles north of Sao Paulo, according to
highway patrolman Joao Goncalves.
   He gave this account:
   Six people were killed, including four from one family, in an
accident involving at least 25 vehicles.
   Two miles away a truck driver was killed in a five-vehicle
pileup.
   Six people perished when four cars were engulfed in flames in an
accident involving two trucks and five cars.
   Goncalves said fog covered most of the Paraiba valley early
Saturday and turned several miles of the busy Dutra highway
connecting two of Brazil's main cities into ``a deadly trap.''
   ``You could't see more than a few yards away, '' he said.

<HEAD>Central America Expert Says It's Time to Cut a Deal with Nicaragua</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS quote in 15th graf from ``willingness'' to
``unwillingness.''

   The head of Latin American studies at the U.S.
Army War College says Nicaragua's Sandinista army is too strong to
be defeated by U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas and that it is time to
cut a deal.
   ``Half a loaf is better than no loaf at all,'' said Col. Alden
M. Cunningham, who was Army attache at the U.S. Embassy in
Nicaragua from May 1985 until December 1986 and since then has been
Director of Americas Studies at the war college in Carlisle, Pa.
   ``I don't say that we should stop supporting the Contras,
because without that the Sandinistas are not going to have any
reason to talk. The reason they are willing to talk now is because
of the successes of the Contras,'' Cunningham said in a telephone
interview Friday.
   Talks between the warring parties broke down in early June,
although a fragile truce remains in place while Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias tries to arrange another session.
   The United States continues to send humanitarian aid to the
Contras. And this week the Senate may vote to send them as much as
$20 million in military aid, to be released by a subsequent
congressional vote. Military aid was suspended last winter.
   Even if the United States sends military aid to the Contras, it
should not expect to win, said Cunningham, because over the past
three years the Soviet-backed government in Nicaragua has doubled
the strength of its counterinsurgency forces.
   Cunningham's views first came to light in an article published
in the March edition of the war college's quarterly ``Parameters''
magazine. He has spent the last 12 years dealing with Central
America, as assistant Army attache in Mexico, an earlier stint at
the war college, and in a policy job at the Pentagon.
   The Sandinistas, bolstered by record levels of aid from the
Soviet Union and up to 3,000 Cuban military advisers, have beefed
up their counterinsurgency forces to 45,000 soldiers, forming more
than 13 irregular warfare battalions, more than 12 light hunter
battalions and a frontier guard corps of 5,000.
   ``Army firepower and mobility have also made progress over the
last two years,'' Cunningham wrote. ``With the approximate doubling
of the helicopter force from six (Soviet-made) HIND helicopters and
15 (Soviet-made) HIP helicopters to 10-12 HINDS and 35 HIPS and the
addition of between 1,000 and 2,000 trucks in 1986-87 alone, the
Sandinista forces have gained increased mobility in the
counterinsurgency war.''
   The Contras, which Cunningham estimates to be about 18,000, have
``created a major strain in Sandinista attention and resources,''
but they have failed to gain a military or political foothold along
the heavily populated Pacific coast.
   Cunningham said he had come to three main conclusions: ``The
Sandinistas are not going to become democrats; we are not going to
invade; and the Contras are not going to win a military victory.''
   And the United States has three main options: arm the Contras to
conduct a long war, hoping to wear down the Sandinistas; prepare
the Contras for a major push, which would give them enough of a
political foothold to rationalize a U.S. invasion; or negotiate.
   A deal is the only real option, he concludes.
   The U.S. aim in the negotiations, he said, should be to ``assure
that our security concerns were taken care of and open up as much
political space as we could'' for the opposition forces. Senior
administration officials have expressed similar goals.
   ``What we must keep in mind,'' he wrote, ``is that we do not
have any real present alternative in view of the strong likelihood
that the guerrillas cannot defeat the Sandinistas and in view of
our own unwillingness to engage U.S. forces.''
   The Contras are unlikely to win a protracted war against an
entrenched Sandinista government, backed by the Kremlin.
   And a sharply escalating civil war, followed by a U.S. invasion
of Nicaragua, is not a realistic option, because the American
people ``simply cannot conceive of a country with only 3 million
people as a threat to U.S. interests,'' he said.
   ``The U.S. military leadership also has no desire to get
involved with Nicaragua with U.S. combat forces, in large part
precisely because the lack of public support for American troop
involvement in the Third World,'' he wrote.
   Cunningham said that it took him several months to clear his
article through the Army and the magazine, but since it was
published he has had ``zero'' criticism from the administration.
   ``I haven't heard of much reaction at all, either negative or
positive. No one has called me up to complain,'' he said. ``But
before it was published, it was a real battle to get it approved.''

   Two freight trains collided head on
Saturday, killing two crew members, and about 1,000 residents were
evacuated because of fears that two overturned tank cars could
explode, authorities said.
   Two men saved themselves by leaping from their locomotive before
the crash.
   A hazardous-chemical emergency team rushed to the site in a corn
field outside this suburb northeast of Des Moines after the noon
crash of two Iowa Interstate trains. Authorities said they feared a
fire would touch off tank cars containing denatured alcohol.
   A state official said a small fire was burning on top of one of
the tank cars, but officials intended to let it burn itself out.
   ``You can see flames every now and then coming out of the top
port,'' said Jerry Ostendorf, operations manager of the state
division of disaster services.
   A railroad official said authorities were evacuating an area
within 1.5 miles of the wreck site, which includes at least 1,000
people. But at an amusement park two miles away, an estimated 9,000
people were allowed to continue riding attractions.
   ``It's just a safety precaution,'' said Anthony Bacino,
hazardous materials officer for Iowa Interstate. ``It's a
possibility that the liquid could expand and cause the cars to
explode.
   ``They would take off like a rocket _ they could go a mile.''
   The evacuation could last up to 24 hours, Bacino said.
   He said safety valves on the cars so far appeared to be
functioning to prevent an explosive buildup of pressure inside the
cars.
   The two trains had a total of 86 cars. Ten were derailed and
four overturned, Bacino said.
   Polk County Sheriff's Lt. David Long said both of the dead
trainmen were aboard a westbound freight train and that the crew of
the other train managed a last-minute escape and were only slightly
injured.
   ``The two on the eastbound train jumped off before the
collision,'' he said. ``Those on the westbound train did not
(jump). We still have not been able to recover the bodies.''
   Long said it was too early to know for sure why the trains were
on the same track.
   Diesel fuel spilling from the locomotives caused minor grass
fires, which were soon brought under control.
   Long said the fumes from denatured alcohol are toxic and
explosive.
   The Iowa Interstate took over some of the tracks formerly
operated by the Rock Island Railroad several years ago.
   At nearby Adventureland Park, president Jack Krantz said he had
been assured by the Polk County sheriff's department that it was
safe to continue normal operations. He estimated the crowd Saturday
at about 9,000.
   Michelle Bliss, an emergency medical technician who lives a
quarter mile from the crash, went to the scene after hearing the
crash.
   ``We could see the flames shooting in the air,'' she said. ``The
engines were a mangled mess.''
   Gov. Terry Branstad went to the scene late Saturday and told
reporters that Altoona residents were lucky the crash was outside
city limits.

   Lucille S. Hurley Thompson, a
nutrition scholar whose research linked some dietary deficiencies
of expectant mothers with birth defects, has died at age 66.
   The University of California, Davis, professor died Thursday
morning in a Sacramento hospital after open-heart surgery.
   Beginning in the 1950s, she studied the effects of the trace
metals manganese, zinc, magnesium, iron and copper on fetal
development.
   During her career, she received two Guggenheim Fellowships, five
visiting scholar appointments abroad and numerous nutrition
research awards. She served on several committees of the National
Institutes of Health and the National Academy of Sciences national
research council.
   She was named editor of the Journal of Nutrition in 1984 and had
served as president of three national scientific organizations.
   Known professionally as Dr. Hurley, she was born in Riga,
Latvia, now part of the Soviet Union, and immigrated to the United
States with her family at age 3.
   She is survived by her husband, Kenneth Thompson of Sacramento;
a daughter, Barbara Jungerman of San Francisco; a son, Michael
Hurley of Shingle Springs; a stepdaughter, Tamara Wright of
Seattle; stepsons, Nicolas Thompson of West Sacramento and Marcus
Thompson of San Jose; a brother, Dr. Milton Shapson of Milwaukee; a
sister, Phyllis Shapson of Los Angeles; and two grandsons.

   Thick fog blanketed sections of the

<HEAD>China to Restore Military Ranks Aug. 1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China announced Saturday it was restoring a
military rank system abolished by Mao Tse-tung 23 years ago as part
of his attempt to turn China into a classless society.
   The official Xihnua News Agency said more than 100,000 military
officers will wear their uniforms on Monday, which is Army Day, and
join a new civilian staff of scientists, teachers and other
specialists.
   Also Saturday, a ceremony was held reviving the bestowing of
medals to the military. Communist Party General Secretary Zhao
Ziyang, President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng attended the
ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, in which more than 80,000
military veterans received medals.
   The military reforms are the work of Deng Xiaoping, Mao's
successor as China's top leader and head of the Central Military
Commission. Deng was not present at Saturday's ceremony.
   Deng, 84, has abandoned Mao's concept of a massive peasant army
and sought to turn the People's Liberation Army into a streamlined,
well-equipped and modern fighting force.
   In the past few years he has reduced the world's largest army
from 4 million to 3 million, concentrated on developing modern
weapons systems and pushed for the reinstatement of ranks.
   The restoration of ranks and the awarding of medals, banned by
Mao in 1965, is an effort to boost army morale when the military
has been overshadowed in China's push for economic modernization.
   Under the reforms, military officers in the army are to be
divided into three grades with 11 ranks. There will be four ranks
of generals, four ranks of field officer _ senior colonel, colonel,
lieutenant colonel and major _ and three ranks of company officer _
captain, lieutenant and second lieutenant.

   A crop-duster aircraft clipped the tail
section of another crop-duster, causing the planes to crash into a
soybean field and killing the two pilots, officials said Saturday.
   The single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft crashed Friday
night into a farm adjacent to the Almyra Municipal Airport, about
60 miles southeast of Little Rock. The veteran pilots were
finishing up spraying insecticide on soybean fields when the
accident occurred.
   The pilots were identified as James R. Perry, 35, and George W.
Tiefenback Jr., 63, both of Almyra.
   Debbie Dowdy, a radio operator with the Arkansas State Police,
said Perry had just turned off his sprayer when his plane clipped
the tail section of Tiefenback's aircraft.
   State Police Trooper Barry Roy said the planes had been going
back and forth between the airport and the field. He speculated
that the pilots got out of sequence and were unaware they were both
over the field.
   A Federal Aviation Administration investigator was at the crash
scene Saturday and could not be reached for comment.

   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev expressed concern
Saturday to West Germany's foreign minister about Western European
plans for greater military and economic integration, Tass reported.
   The official news agency said Gorbachev told Hans-Dietrich
Genscher at a meeting in the Kremlin that the plans could set back
progress for disarmament and security in Europe.
   It reported Gorbachev said West European politicians must bear
responsibility for any damage to ``positive beginnings'' toward
improving security.
   Genscher told Gorbachev that the creation of a single market by
1992 within the 12-member European Economic Community would not
endanger the continent and ``increases possibilities for
cooperation and openness,'' according to the Tass report.
   Genscher arrived in Moscow Friday and is to prepare for the
October visit to the Soviet capital by West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl. Gorbachev is to visit West Germany during the first
half of 1989.
   Tass said that Gorbachev, referring to international
negotiations in Vienna on reducing conventional arms in Europe,
told Genscher ``no one should count on our unilateral
disarmament.'' The North Atlantic Treaty Organization contends that
the Soviet Union has larger conventional forces there and should
make bigger cuts.
   Genscher told reporters after the meeting that he and Gorbachev
discussed ways to speed efforts to agree on reducing conventional
weapons in Europe.

   The last of the 2,000 people driven from their homes by a South
Dakota forest fire returned Saturday after firefighters contained
the blaze that destroyed 15 houses, and the worst fires in
Yellowstone National Park since the 1600s calmed down.
   ``It was close,'' fire information officer Michele Case said
Saturday of the six-day fire that blackened 3,840 acres on the
western edge of Rapid City, S.D. ``People in this community were
real nervous for a couple of days.''
   A second smaller fire broke out Saturday in the Black Hills
National Forest near Rapid City, about four miles from the larger
fire. Officials said the fire of undetermined origin had burned 30
acres by early evening and a few people in the area left their
homes.
   Forest fires also raged Saturday in Washington, Idaho and
Montana, but crews contained a 200-acre blaze in Wisconsin and a
5,400-acre grass fire in a rugged area of western North Dakota.
   The blazes in Yellowstone had burned 107,000 acres in the 2.2
million-acre park.
   Officials hoped to have the Rapid City fire controlled by Sunday
evening. The first 100 firefighters to be released left Saturday.
More than 1,000 firefighters remained on duty to extinguish hot
spots.
   The arson fire, which broke out Tuesday, destroyed 42
outbuildings and more than 40 vehicles. Damage was estimated at
$1.3 million.
   Firefighters, many of them from small volunteer fire
departments, saved an estimated 100 homes and other property worth
$4.2 million by pouring water on them while flames passed,
officials said.
   The fire burned to within a few feet of Gene Ickler's home but
did not damage it.
   ``You feel like doing a cartwheel to see your home standing,''
said Ickler, who was among the evacuees. But the trees that were
once part of his view ``look like black toothpicks,'' he said.
   State and local law enforcement agencies appointed a task force
to find the arsonist. Rewards for information leading to an arrest
grew to at least $17,000.
   The southern entrance to Yellowstone, closed for a week because
of fires, will reopen Sunday, said park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   By Saturday, the Grant Village and Old Faithful complexes of
stores, visitors' centers and campgrounds in the park in
northwestern Wyoming were considered well protected, fire officials
said.
   ``There's no fire anywhere near any park buildings,'' said Costa
Dillon, a National Park Service spokesman. ``It would be
extraordinary if Old Faithful was threatened again by this fire.''
   Firefighters using hand tools and torches to cut fire breaks and
fire hoses to put out flying embers saved Grant Village. Later in
the week, they burned out 650 acres of heavy, dry material such as
branches and leaves on the forest floor to rob the fire of fuel.
   The only building damage came to a scorched privy at Grant
Village, Dillon said.
   Under park policy, the fires were being controlled and directed
by firebreaks where possible, rather than aggressively battled, and
probably will burn until the snow falls, although periodic rain
will shrink them in size, foresters said.
   ``The last time the park burned like this was in the 1600s,''
said ranger Don Buss. ``All this fuel has been building up ever
since, and we've added to it by putting out all fires for about 100
years. The park needs this, within limits, and it will be the best
thing to help expand the age diversity of our forest.''
   Buss said scientists learned the last period a similar major
fire had occurred by determining the age of the growth in the area,
which has lodgepole pine stands that are about 300 years old.
   In Idaho about 35 miles north of Boise, 10 families evacuated
because of a Gulch fire in the Boise National Forest were back in
their remote mountain homes Saturday.
   Erratic wind, compounded by dense smoke, high temperatures and
low humidity sent embers a half mile ahead of the fire. Nearly
1,000 people fought the 5,000-acre blaze and fire bosses had no
estimate of when it might be contained.
   In Washington state, cooler weather and lighter wind aided
firefighters battling a 3,600-acre forest fire along the crest of
the Cascade Mountains.
   About half of the 30 miles of trail needed to bring the fire
under control had been completed by Saturday morning, said Jack
Zaccardo of the state Department of Natural Resources. Four
minimum-security inmates fighting the blaze escaped, officials said.

   About 2,000 people marched
through the capital Saturday to mourn a leftist leader whose death
has been blamed by associates on government security forces.
   Hundreds of helmeted riot police with clubs and assault rifles
kept watch, but there were no reports of violence.
   Marchers in Saturday's procession carried the coffin of
Rigoberto Orellana, whose battered body was found at a downtown
street on Thursday.
   Orellana was one of the founders of a 6-week-old movement known
as Bread, Labor, Work and Liberty, a leftist alliance of unionists,
peasants and students.
   Alliance leaders said Friday that a car driven by a member of
the government security forces had hit him intentionally.
   However, speakers at Saturday's march said he had been beaten to
death. They said Orellana's body was dumped at the curb to make his
death look like a hit-and-run accident.
   The Associated Press was unable to locate anyone who would
comment on the murder accusation in repeated telephone calls to the
armed forces press office Friday and Saturday.
   Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Vides Casanova has called the new
leftist group a front for the leftist guerrillas who have fought
the U.S.-backed government for eight years.
   On Friday, about 600 marchers demonstrated in memorial to at
least 14 students who were shot by security forces trying to
disperse a protest on July 30, 1975.

   Two men wanted in connection with a drug
syndicate that allegedly attempted to smuggle heroin to the United
States in the bodies of dead fish were jailed Saturday pending a
U.S. extradition request, police said.
   Police spokesman Robert Yiu identified the two suspects as Wong
Tsz-keung, a 34-year-old Chinese-American, and Leung Tak-lun, a
37-year-old Hong Kong factory owner.
   The two were arrested Friday at their homes in the British
colony. Yiu said they appeared in court Saturday and were remanded
in jail custody for 45 days pending the arrival of extradition
documents from the United States.
   Police said the two men were members of a syndicate broken March
9 when police in the Chinese city of Shanghai found a large number
of dead fish among 25 boxes of fish scheduled to be shipped to San
Francisco aboard a Chinese airliner.
   Authorities found sutures in the sides of the dead fish and 7.8
pounds of heroin packets planted inside.
   Eleven people _ six in China, three in the United States and two
in Hong Kong _ were arrested following the seizure.

<HEAD>British Government Gives Sanctuary to Woman In Angola</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Embassy in Angola has given refuge to
a woman who reportedly was detained for two years by the African
National Congress, the Foreign Office said Saturday.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, who was not named in keeping with
British custom, said the British government was trying to obtain an
exit visa for Olivia Forsyth. She has dual South African-British
nationality, the domestic agency Press Association reported.
   ``She has sought refuge there (in the embassy in the Angolan
capital of Luanda), having been detained against her will by the
ANC for 22 months,'' said the spokesman.
   ``She has asked to be allowed to come back to Britain and we are
asking the Angolans to give her an exit visa.''
   The Mail on Sunday newspaper reported that Miss Forsyth, 27, was
closely involved with black opposition groups in South Africa,
including the ANC, which is outlawed in South Africa.
   The newspaper reported that it was believed that she was held at
an ANC prison near Lubango, southern Angola, because she was
accused of spying for the South African secret service.
   It reported that she had been staying at the British Embassy in
Luanda for nearly 10 weeks.
   The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, made no immediate comment.
   The ANC says its goals, which it now believes can only be
achieved by the overthrow of South Africa's white-led government,
are for a one-man, one-vote state.
   Under South Africa's system of apartheid, the 26 million black
majority has no vote in national affairs, and the 5 million whites
control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and

<HEAD>Government Posts Reward to Help Solve Solidarity Adviser's Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has offered an $11,000
reward in an effort to solve the killing of an adviser to the
banned Solidarity labor movement, the state-run news agency said
Saturday.
   The announcement of the Interior Ministry reward came two weeks
after more than 1,000 mourners, including Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa, attended Jan Strzelecki's funeral in a Warsaw cemetery. The
inquiry into the slaying has become a major area of concern for
Polish intellectuals and senior Solidarity advisers.
   Police found the body of Strzelecki, an opposition sociologist,
near the Vistula River on June 30, the state-run news agency PAP
reported in early July. The sociologist had been dragged from his
car, beaten and thrown down an embankment, according to police.
   Strzelecki remained in a coma until he died from his head
injuries on July 11, a fellow sociologist said at the time.
   PAP said Saturday the Interior Ministry was offering the reward
for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the
fatal attack.
   A group of Warsaw sociologists on July 6 offered a $2,200 reward
in the case. Polish television Tuesday broadcast a re-enactment of
the crime and broadcast police appeals for help in solving it.
   Solidarity leaders, who say they are puzzled by the case, have
made no public statement about it.

   President Reagan renewed his plea for
congressional support of rebels in Nicaragua Saturday and linked a
top official of the country's leftist government with the illicit
drug trade.
   ``While the cutoff of aid to the Freedom Fighters was a dreadful
mistake, getting the cause of peace and freedom back on track, not
recrimination, must now be our goal,'' Reagan said in his weekly
radio address.
   ``There is a chance for a real bipartisan consensus in support
of Contra aid,'' the president said from the presidential retreat
at Camp David.
   He noted that ``one of its strong supporters'' _ Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas, who has voted for aid for the rebels in the past
_ has been named as the Democratic candidate for vice president.
   Reagan appealed for support of legislation being proposed by
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., that calls for $27 million
in humanitarian assistance, with an additional $20 million in
military aid to be triggered later if it is found to be needed.
   ``Final details are being worked out,'' Reagan said. ``I urge
members of the Senate to support the aid package, and I also ask
the House of Representatives to move speedily and favorably on the
Senate legislation.''
   Reagan said the House decision in February to cut off Contra aid
``removed the principal prod, the military victories and popular
success of the Freedom Fighters, to Sandinista participation in the
peace plan.''
   He said it ``sent an immediate signal of American weakness to
the Communists'' and has had ``costly and sad consequences.''
   ``In Nicaragua, a renewed attack on political dissent is being
led by the head of the secret police, Tomas Borge, a dedicated
Communist and grim, hardened represser of human rights, whose
office, according to our Commission on Organized Crime, has also
been actively engaged in the international drug trade,'' he said.
   ``Acting under the orders of the Communist leaders and Borges'
supervision, Sandinista police and goon squads have brutally broken
up a peaceful demonstration by 3,000 Nicaraguans'' and otherwise
acted against political and religious freedoms, Reagan said.
   In the Democratic response, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., praised
the congressionally approved drought legislation as ``an important
first step in addressing a situation that threatens America's
farmers.''
   He then said bills approved by Congress concerning defense
spending and plant closings ``deserved the president's support and
which Congress should pass over any presidential veto.''
   On the defense bill, Levin said Congress had given the president
the funding he had requested.
   ``As in the past, President Reagan overemphasized nuclear
weapons and Star Wars at the expense of our conventional weapons,''
the senator said. ``He also proposed actions which would make
effective arms control harder to achieve and maintain.''
   Levin also urged the president to support the plant closing
legislation which requires employers to give workers a 60-day
notice prior to layoffs.
   ``This bill isn't aimed at companies that are going to do the
decent thing anyway,''he said countering the president's argument
against the bill. ``It is aimed at companies, like the one I know
in Michigan, that told its workers on a Friday afternoon that they
were being laid off for two weeks.''

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Connecticut Democrats nominated state
Attorney General Joseph I. Lieberman for the U.S. Senate Saturday
to challenge three-term Republican Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
   Lieberman did not attend the Democratic State Convention because
it fell on the Jewish Sabbath, and he is an Orthodox Jew. In an
acceptance speech videotaped last week and shown to the 1,305
delegates he said, ``This is not an easy day for me to miss.''
   Lieberman said he was an unworried underdog.
   ``As attorney general, I've fought the big guys against the
odds, time and time again and we've won there,'' he said. ``So long
as I believe in myself and I know that you are with me, together we
can make a difference.''
   Although well behind Weicker in polls, Lieberman has raised $1.3
million to Weicker's $1.8 million, according to the most recent
campaign finance filings.
   Lieberman, the attorney general for six years, was nominated by
acclamation, touching off an eight-minute demonstration led by
gospel singers and Gov. William A. O'Neill doing a lively two-step
on the stage to the delight of onlookers.
   O'Neill and Lieberman have had occasional political skirmishes
over the years. For many years, Lieberman said he would one day
like to be governor. But Lieberman has more recently said he would
not run against O'Neill. The governor has strongly indicated he
will run for a third full term in 1990.
   Referring to Lieberman's ``people's lawyer'' reputation, O'Neill
said: ``You can see the results of his work everywhere you look _
in lower utility rates, in lower grocery prices, in clean rivers
and in pure drinking water.''
   Lieberman, a former state senator from New Haven, criticized
Weicker for his maverick ways, quoting a voter who told him that
Weicker ``has made a lot of noise but he hasn't made a lot of
difference.''
   Lieberman has said during the campaign that his beliefs would
not preclude him from attending Senate sessions on Saturdays should
he be elected, because he would then be performing a service for
others, something permitted in his religion.

   An inmate armed with a rifle and a handgun
escaped late Saturday in a prison ambulance after briefly taking a
guard hostage, touching off a manhunt in three central Ohio
counties, authorities said.
   Michael Cardine, 36, of Marysville, escaped from the
medium-security London Correctional Institute about 15 miles
southwest of Columbus at 6:45 p.m., said John McNulty, a dispatcher
for the State Highway Patrol in Columbus.
   Cardine was armed with a 9mm rifle with 15 rounds of ammunition
and a .38-caliber handgun with six rounds of ammunition, McNulty
said. How Cardine obtained the weapons and fled in the prison
ambulance were not immediately known.
   Cardine was serving a 22-to-70-year sentence on kidnapping,
armed robbery and drug possession charges, authorities said.
   Prison Warden Arnold Jago said Cardine apparently made his way
to the front of the facility by tricking guards at several gates
inside the prison.
   ``A couple of employees weren't doing their jobs,'' Jago said.
He declined to elaborate, saying the investigation was continuing
and that interviews were still under way with witnesses.
   Jago said the officer Cardine took hostage to make his escape
was able to get free. Jago would not give further details.
   Officers concentrated their search near the Champaign County
village of Mechanicsburg after receiving a report that the white
van bearing state license tags and prison insignia was spotted
there.
   The search also involved the counties of Madison, where the
prison is located, and Union, where Marysville is located, McNulty
said.

<TEXT>
   Grammy Award-winning musician and record
producer Pete Drake, who introduced the ``talking'' steel guitar
style, has died from complications of lung disease. He was 55.
   Drake, who died Friday at his home in suburban Brentwood,
received the Master Award from the Nashville Entertainment
Association and was inducted into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame in
St. Louis in 1987.
   He also was honored in the Walkway of Stars at the Country Music
Hall of Fame in 1970.
   Drake's distinctive steel guitar style was introduced on such
hits as the 1964 instrumental, ``Forever.''
   As a record producer, Drake worked with Ringo Starr, B.J.
Thomas, Slim Whitman, Boxcar Willie, Melba Montgomery and Ernest
Tubb.
   Drake brought Starr to Nashville to record ``Beaucoups of
Blues'' in 1970, creating a sensation because Starr then became the
first Beatle to record in the United States.
   His instrumental talents were employed by such superstars as Bob
Dylan, George Harrison, Roger Miller, Elvis Presley, Andy Williams,
Kenny Rogers, George Jones, Joan Baez, Tammy Wynette and The Oak
Ridge Boys.
   He started as a road musician and sideman on the Grand Ole Opry,
and later operated several record labels, including Stop Records in
the 1960s and First Generation Records in the 1970s.
   Drake is survived by his wife, Rose Trimble Drake; mother, Nora
Blevins of Nashville; a son and seven daughters; and 13
grandchildren. His funeral is scheduled for Monday afternoon in
Nashville.

   Pop music star Boy George peddled clothing and
singer Eartha Kitt ran a hair dryer as about 200 celebrities tended
shop Saturday to raise money for AIDS charities.
   Stars from the music world, theater, television and films
volunteered their services to 251 businesses in Covent Garden, a
central London plaza and shopping complex. The businesses agreed to
donate at least 5 percent of Saturday's till to the charities
fighting the deadly disease.
   Colored balloons decked the roofs, pop musicians performed
non-stop on a courtyard stage, and thousands of shoppers and
star-gazers wandered the streets of the shopping district that once
was London's wholesale flower market.
   Shouting fans besieged Boy George when he turned up at a store
to sell clothes.
   ``I was a window dresser, and I used to have my own shop, so I'm
used to selling things,'' he said.
   Ms. Kitt became a hairdresser for a day and set right to work.
   ``You never know when I'm going to be doing this for a living,''
she joked, waving a hair dryer.
   Other stars contributing to the effort included pop singer Rick
Astley, actresses Greta Scacchi and Geraldine James, and actors
Charles Dance and Colin Firth.

   Mighty Mouse, the cartoon character accused
by a fundamentalist preacher of snorting cocaine, will spoof
religious zealots in an upcoming episode, animator Ralph Bakshi
said.
   The Rev. Donald Wildmon, of Tupelo, Miss., and his American
Family Association, a conservative media watchdog group, claimed
the cartoon hero inhaled narcotics during an episode.
   Bakshi insisted Mighty Mouse was sniffing flower petals.
   ``I despise drugs,'' Bakshi said Thursday. ``I would be out of
my mind to show a character snorting cocaine in a cartoon.''
   To end the uproar, Bakshi clipped 3{ seconds from the cartoon.
   But this season, the first episode of ``Mighty Mouse: The New
Adventures'' will feature a story line that pokes fun at groups
like the one run by Wildmon, he said.
   And if that isn't enough, Mighty Mouse himself might take
matters into his own hands, the animator said.
   ``He's going to fly to Tupelo, Mississippi, and I hope he does
right by me,'' Bakshi said.

   Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias made a

talks with Albanian Foreign Minister Reiz Malile.
   The discussions focused on bilateral relations, said government
spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos.
   Papoulias, who made the trip at the invitation of Malile, also
flew to Albania last November for a three-day visit.
   Malile returned the visit in March, becoming the first Albanian
foreign minister to travel to Greece.
   Greece and Albania established relations in 1971. They were
improved in Septemeer 1987 when Premier Andreas Papandreou ended a
47-year-old technical state of war between the neighboring

   Greece is among several Western countries being courted by
Albania as it cautiously opens to the outside world after more than

<HEAD>13 Western Creditors Approve Rescheduling Of Part Of Brazil's Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Paris Club of Western creditor nations agreed
Saturday to reschedule part of Brazil's huge foreign debt.
   An announcement said the agreement would be applied to payments
involving nearly $5 billion in debts with the payments having been
scheduled between January 1, 1987, and March 31, 1990. The $5
billion is a third of Brazil's public debt of $15 billion.
   Overall, Brazil is the most indebted nation in the developing
world, owing $121.5 billion to foreign creditors.
   The Paris Club statement said the agreement on the $5 billion
portion rescheduled the payment over 10 years, including a
five-year grace period.
   ``Brazil will pay neither a cent of interest nor principal until
March 31, 1990'' on the rescheduled debt,'' said Sergio Amaral,
secretary for international affairs at Brazil's Ministry of Finance.
   The arrangement was reached after a two-day meeting between
representatives of Brazil and its 13 public creditors.
   Observers noted it is unusual for rescheduling arrangements by
the Paris Club to include interest as well as principal.
   The Paris Club statement said the creditor countries ``welcomed
the efforts at economic recovery'' undertaken by Brazil and wanted
to ``make a positive contribution to the improvement of this
country's external payments prospects in order to facilitate the
recovery of its economy.''
   The 13 creditor countries involved in the agreement are Austria,
Belgium, Canada, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain and the United
States.

<TEXT>
   A trapper attacked by a 10-foot,
500-pound alligator suffered a mangled arm and a bullet wound in
the leg when officers accidentally shot him as they killed the
animal.
   Lee County sheriff's detective Bill Cameron called the mauling
of Joseph Hays the most terrifying thing he has ever seen.
   ``He screamed, `Help me, help me, oh God, please help me,'''
Cameron said. ``It was screaming like I've never heard before. It
sent chills down my spine.''
   Cameron and three other officers opened fire with handguns,
pumping about 10 bullets into the giant reptile. The gator remained
alive but released its grip on Hays, 22.
   The officers pulled Hays clear of the alligator, then shot eight
more times before the beast was dead.
   ``We weren't taking any chances,'' Cameron said.
   Authorities later learned the alligator had been struck by an
automobile only minutes before it attacked Hays.
   The alligator trapper from Port Charlotte was hospitalized in
serious but stable condition at Lee County Memorial Hospital with
the injured arm and a bullet wound in the right calf.
   He is the most recent victim in a series of violent encounters
between humans and alligators in Southwest Florida _ including the
June death of a 4-year-old girl.
   Friday's deadly drama began shortly after 10 p.m. in a darkened
field in North Fort Myers about a mile from the Caloosahatchee
River.
   Cameron was driving in the area when he saw the alligator lying
beside the road. Fearing that joggers might run up on the gator in
the darkness, Cameron radioed the sheriff's department and waited
for help.
   Deputies contacted the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission, who in turn notified a trapper licensed to handle
nuisance alligators.
   Randy Pearson, licensed alligator trapper for the game
commission, and Hays, his assistant, arrived to capture the animal.
The animal attacked when Pearson was sitting astride it, holding
its jaws closed while Hays prepared to tape them shut.
   Game commission Sgt. Ray Hager said injuries probably made the
alligator more aggressive than it normally would have been.

   Ten anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested
Saturday at an Atlanta women's clinic and went to jail refusing to
identify themselves, as more than 100 others have done in the past
two weeks.
   Meanwhile, more than 180 supporters of the Atlanta protest were
arrested in Pittsburgh, but police said most were quickly released.
   In Chicago, two caskets containing what an anti-abortion group
said were 2,000 fetuses were lowered in graves Saturday during a
ceremony officiated at by Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Bernardin.
   The Pro-Life Action League, which arranged the burial, said the
fetuses were obtained from clinics and hospitals in five states,
along with the names of the mothers and the physicians who
performed the abortions.
   The Atlanta demonstrators were arrested Saturday morning at the
Atlanta Women's Medical Center after they blocked entrances. Other
protesters urged women not to go in for their abortion appointments.
   The arrested demonstrators, all charged with criminal
trespassing, refused to identify themselves and were held, jail
officials said.
   The demonstration was the latest by ``Operation Rescue,'' which
has staged several protests here since the Democratic National
Convention two weeks ago.
   Many of those arrested have refused to give their names, calling
themselves ``Baby Jane Doe'' or ``Baby John Doe,'' in solidarity,
they say, with aborted fetuses.
   Some demonstrators have been released on their own recognizance,
but officials say they cannot release people who will not give
their names and addresses because they could not be found again for
trial. Most have pleaded innocent to criminal trespass charges.
   Operation Rescue spokesman Lowell Patterson said about 75
percent of the demonstrators have vowed to remain in jail until
their appearances in State Court, if that date is within the next
month or so. Others probably will give their names before that
because of business or personal concerns, he said.
   In Pittsburgh about 180 anti-abortion protesters were arrested
and cited for obstructing traffic during a Saturday morning sit-in
sponsored by Operation Rescue at a building housing two abortion
clinics.
   Most had been released by mid-day, Sgt. Michael Lucia said.
Their citations require them to appear before a judge at a later
date, he said. Police said all gave their names.
   Protesters sang, prayed and listened to speeches, group
spokeswoman Barbara Page said. ``Everyone remained peaceful and
nonviolent,'' but Page said some members complained of hair pulling
and shoving during the arrest.

<TEXT>
   Folk singer Pete Seeger, New York City
activist Al Sharpton and 10 others were released Saturday night
after spending one day in jail for disorderly conduct in a racially
charged protest over an alleged rape.
   Attorney Alton Maddox Jr., representing Sharpton and 10 others,
refused to call the release a victory.
   ``In a case that did not measure up to a criminal conviction,''
Maddox said he was surprised at Albany Police Court Judge Thomas
Keegan's decision ``to put everybody away immediately.''
   ``It caused some hardships,'' Maddox said. ``There was no gap
between conviction and sentence.''
   Seeger's lawyer, William A. Brenner, showed up at the Albany
jail with Seeger's banjo.
   ``Pete Seeger doesn't understand all this legal mumbo-jumbo,''
Brenner said. ``When he sees a banjo, he knows he's out.''
   ``I wanted to express my unity with people I considered my
brothers and sisters,'' Seeger said outside the jail. ``I am very
happy to have done so.''
   As the group left the jail about 10:35 p.m, Sharpton called out
to guards, ``I'll be back but I might be late for basketball
tomorrow.''
   Sharpton, appearing to be in high spirits, said he attended
church services Saturday morning and played basketball with some of
the inmates. The rotund minister said he spent the day fasting and
had lost about 2 pounds.
   The six men and six women were ordered released, pending an
appeal, by New York State Supreme Court Judge Paul Cheeseman, who
met at his home for three hours with Maddox, Brenner, Albany County
District Attorney Sol Greenberg and attorney C. Vernon Mason.
   Mason, Maddox and Sharpton have been acting as advisers for
Tawana Brawley, a black Wappingers Falls teen-ager who claims she
was abducted and sexually assaulted by six white men last November.
   Sharpton, Seeger and 10 others were found guilty Friday of
blocking traffic in downtown Albany during an April 4 demonstration
on behalf of Ms. Brawley. Brawley family members have refused to
cooperate with investigators and have claimed they cannot get
justice because of official racism.
   The protesters were sentenced to 15 days in jail. Two other
defendants were acquitted after a three-day, non-jury trial heard
by Keegan.

<TEXT>
   Still energetic after 100 years, this town
helped a farmer relocate his barn by picking it up and moving it
about 110 feet.
   At Bruno's centennial celebration Saturday, 328 volunteers
grabbed steel poles that Herman Ostry and his sons had placed
underneath their barn. As several hundred spectators cheered, the
volunteers lifted the 60-year-old structure, moved it several feet
and set it down. And they repeated the feat for 20 minutes until
the barn was 10 feet to the east and 100 feet to the north.
   Ostry estimated that the barn weighs nearly nine tons, so each
volunteer had to lift more than 50 pounds, he said.
   After moving the barn to its new home, the volunteers turned the
structure clockwise until the side that was facing west faced the
south.
   Ostrey said he wanted to move the barn to higher, drier ground
and ``to do something different for the centennial, and to make
history.''

<HEAD>China says U.S. Senate action harms relations</HEAD>

   A U.S. Senate measure calling on China to halt
missile sales to the Middle East ``brings harm to Sino-U.S.
relations,'' the Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
   The official Xinhua news agency carried the ministry statement.
   It was in response to an amendment, proposed by Sen. Robert
Dole, R-Kan., and added to a State Department appropriations bill
that was approved Wednesday by a vote of 97-0. The amendment
declares that China should halt its sale of ballistic missiles and
other offensive weapons to nations in the Persian Gulf area and
Middle East immediately.
   It also suggests the United States reassess its relations with
China if the arms sales are not stopped.
   The Foreign Ministry statement said: ``China has always taken a
prudent and responsible attitude toward arms sales. This amendment,
which makes a big fuss about the so-called question of `arms
sales,' brings harm to Sino-U.S. Relations. The Chinese government
is firmly opposed to it.''
   U.S. officials have expressed concern about the sale of Chinese
missiles to Saudi Arabia and reported negotiations with Syria to
sell short-range missiles now being developed. China has denied
plans to sell missiles to Syria.
   Last year, U.S.-Chinese relations were strained by U.S.
allegations that China had sold Silkworm anti-ship missiles to
Iran. China denied the claim.
   The United States last fall temporarily froze a further
relaxation of regulations on high technology sales to China to
protest the alleged arms sales to Iran.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Opens New Detention Center for Boat People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government opened another detention center
for Vietnamese boat people Saturday under a new policy designed to
stem the flow of refugees to this British colony.
   Despite the new policy's aim, more than 6,700 boat people have
sailed into Hong Kong since it went into effect June 15.
   About 1,200 refugees were moved Saturday from ferries moored in
the colony's harbor to Erskine Camp, the third temporary detention
center for the boat people.
   The new policy provides that the Vietnamese be kept in those
centers until Vietnam agrees to take them back.
   Boat people who arrived before the new policy took effect are
still eligible for resettlement. They are kept in refugee centers
separate from the detention centers for recent arrivals.
   All boat people arriving after June 15 are considered illegal
immigrants subject to repatriation unless they can prove they fled
persecution in communist Vietnam. The Hong Kong government
previously considered all boat people refugees eligible for
resettlement.
   More than 16,000 Vietnamese refugees are in Hong Kong.
   Also Saturday, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ghafar Baba said
he will go to Hanoi next month to discuss the refugee issue with
Vietnamese leaders. Ghafar did not say when his delegation would
leave for Vietnam, according to Malaysia's Bernama news agency.
   It quoted him as saying about 13,000 Vietnamese refugees are in
Malaysia awaiting resettlement in other countries.

   Millions of substandard bolts and nuts have
been used in everything from military equipment and weapons to the
space shuttle and commercial trucks, a congressional committee said
Saturday.
   ``The millions and perhaps billions of substandard fasteners
used by our military and sensitive industries make it a wonder that
we haven't had a major catastrophe,'' said Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and
its investigations subcommittee.
   A two-year-long investigation by the subcommittee uncovered
millions of substandard bolts, nuts, and screws _ many of them
imported from Japan _ and Dingell said the problem could have
wide-ranging effects.

   Burmese authorities have arrested up to
25 people, including a prominent critic of the authoritarian
government and an Associated Press correspondent, U.S. officials
and other diplomats said Saturday.
   The arrests came less than a week after Sein Lwin, a former army
general known for ruthless suppression of dissidents, replaced Ne
Win as president and chairman of Burma's sole political party.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said U.S.
officials in Burma ``understand that perhaps as many as 25 people
have been arrested within the last 24 hours.''

   A quip attributed to the late Sen. Everett
Dirksen _ ``A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you're
talking about real money'' _ is coming painfully true for federal
bank regulators.
   The $4 billion rescue of First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas and
the closing and rescue of other banks this year will cause the
government insurance fund that backs deposits in commercial banks
to suffer the first loss in its 54-year history.
   Add in billions of dollars being spent to assist the even more
troubled savings and loan industry and it means ``real money'' _
enough to hamper the government's fight to curb the massive federal
budget deficit.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said the fund, which stood at
$18.3 billion at the end of 1987, would likely lose close to $2
billion this year. But, he cautioned, that's a ``best guess'' and
the loss could go higher.

   Technicians stopped a hydrogen leak
and fixed a balky oxygen pump Saturday and NASA said it would
resume a countdown on Sunday leading to the test-firing of space
shuttle Discovery's main engines.
   A countdown leading to the critical test was halted early Friday
when the problems developed, and the firing was postponed three
days, from Monday until Thursday.
   Officials believe the engine test delays, combined with an
unresolved leak in Discovery's steering thruster system, will slip
Discovery's launch date from mid-September into October.

   The summer of '88 is already over in the minds
of countless Northeastern beach lovers revolted by a tide of dead
rats, syringes and sewage that has left miles of shoreline deserted
and seaside businesses shuttered even on the hottest days.
   ``They finally did it _ they ruined the beach,'' said Joe
Lovecchi of Brooklyn. He will limit his ocean dips to ``ankles only
for the rest of the season.''
   Others are not so brave. Attendance has plummeted at Atlantic
beaches since the scare began July 6, when needles and vials of
blood, some of which tested positive for the AIDS virus, began
washing up along Long Island's 120-mile southern shore.

   Mindful of Geraldine Ferraro's ill-fated vice
presidential quest in 1984, Michael Dukakis had aides accompany
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen on his first campaign solo flight.
   The 67-year-old Bentsen is no stranger to campaign work, and the
silver-haired senator took several of his own aides with him on the
campaign foray to California, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas last
week.
   Officials in both the Dukakis and Bentsen camps remember how
Ferraro, Walter F. Mondale's running mate four years ago, hit the
campaign trail unprepared, and want to closely coordinate campaign
activities.

   Michael Dukakis was in Cleveland preparing for
several interviews when he picked up a microphone and announced:
``Good Evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Boston's
historic Faneuil Hall for tonight's segment of `The Advocates.' Our
topic tonight: the horrors of the Vietnam War.''
   The Democratic presidential nominee was simply making a
microphone check, but he also was providing a glimpse back to his
days as a television star, of sorts.
   Ronald Reagan had his ``Death Valley Days'' when he was a
candidate. Dukakis has ``The Advocates.''
   The program Dukakis hosted from 1971 to 1973 and from 1978 to
1980 pitted two teams, usually divided along liberal and
conservative lines, against one another to debate topical issues.
   The 60-minute program, broadcast on public television from
WGBH-TV studios in Boston, kept Dukakis up to date on major issues.
Also, it helped him develop skills on television that he would
later use successfully as a candidate and a governor.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has demanded urgent action
from top Communist Party officials to solve the day-to-day problems
of Soviet citizens, including lack of good food and hours wasted
standing in line.
   ``In our work, we have become involved with many economic
affairs, while sometimes overlooking issues directly bearing on
people's lives,'' the Soviet leader acknowledged Friday at a
meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee.
   His remarks were reported Saturday by the Communist Party daily
Pravda.
   Gorbachev has acknowledged that until ordinary citizens' own
lives improve, many will remain unconvinced that his program for
``perestroika,'' or economic and social restructuring, is working.

   As an outgrowth of the new era in
Soviet-American relations, the United States has been casting a far
more benign eye toward Moscow's allies in Eastern Europe, engaging
in contacts that would have seemed impossible just two years ago.
   For years, Washington tended to look on the East Europeans as
submissive step children of Moscow, with little room for maneuver
either in their internal or external policies.
   But since the advent of the Gorbachev era in 1985, the Reagan
administration has been quietly expanding its contacts among East
bloc countries, especially Poland and Hungary.
   These efforts bore fruit this past week with the first visit
ever to Washington by a Hungarian Communist Party leader and the
first in nine years by a Polish foreign minister.

   The head of Latin American studies at the U.S.
Army War College says Nicaragua's Sandinista army is too strong to
be defeated by U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas and that it is time to
cut a deal.
   ``Half a loaf is better than no loaf at all,'' said Col. Alden
M. Cunningham, who was Army attache at the U.S. Embassy in
Nicaragua from May 1985 until December 1986 and since then has been
Director of Americas Studies at the war college in Carlisle, Pa.
   ``I don't say that we should stop supporting the Contras,
because without that the Sandinistas are not going to have any
reason to talk. The reason they are willing to talk now is because
of the successes of the Contras,'' Cunningham said in a telephone
interview Friday.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will
try to mend a year-old Central American peace plan now in tatters
when he meets here this week with four of the region's foreign
ministers.
   Shultz's initiative appears aimed at increasing diplomatic
pressure on Nicaragua's Sandinista regime and encouraging four
other countries to pursue a negotiated settlement to the area's
conflicts.
   On Monday, the foreign ministers of Guatemala, Honduras, Costa
Rica and El Salvador _ but not Nicaragua _ will present Shultz with
a ``statement of principles'' the Central American leaders agree
are needed to achieve peace. Nicaragua was not invited to the
meeting.
