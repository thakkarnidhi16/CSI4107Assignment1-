<HEAD>Government to Publish Guidelines For Drug Testimng Of Federal
Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will publish stringent
technical guidelines Monday for the random drug testing of federal
employees in sensitive jobs, according to a published report.
   The Washington Post reported in Saturday's editions that the
guidelines will guard against employee cheating by requiring that
toilet water be dyed blue to prevent dilution of urine. Temperature
readings will be taken from the samples to detect substitution.
   Quoting an unidentified government source, the newspaper said
next week's printing in the Federal Register will be followed by a
certification by Health and Human Services that all federal
agencies have a drug-testing program that meets the guidelines.
   Although all agencies have submitted plans outlining who will be
tested and for what drugs, the final certification date was
unclear. Agencies will be required to test for cocaine and
marijuana, but may test for PCP, opiates and amphetamines.
   Finally, the Office of Management and Budget must estimate the
cost of implementation to Congress before the regulations become
effective. The working estimate is thought to be ``about $7
million,'' the paper said.
   The new guidelines draw heavily on the experience of the testing
which has been conducted in the military for the last seven years.
Currently, the Department of Transportation is the only
non-military agency testing employees in sensitive jobs.
   The American Federation of Government Employees, which has filed
suit in federal district court in New Orleans against earlier
informal standards, contends the random drug testing violates
workers' constitutional rights.

<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church said
Thursday it was suspending its effort to mediate Panama's political
crisis as the first major split appeared in the opposition to Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Marcos G. McGrath, the Catholic archbishop of Panama, said in a
statement he was withdrawing his mediation offer for three reasons:
   _Opposition groups refused to talk to the government until it
showed it was willing to discuss the departure of Noriega.
   _The archbishop had not received Noriega's ``explicit and
personal backing of the initiative'' in writing.
   _There were no assurances that the four international leaders
who proposed the talks could be present.
   The breakdown came a day after Noriega ordered the arrests of
several leading opponents. The general has defied U.S. efforts to
force his resignation.
   In another development, banking and diplomatic sources said
Panama's banks would not reopen Friday, and possibly not next week.
The government said last week it hoped to have banks functioning
again Friday.
   Police detained 15 people Thursday night after using tear gas
and rubber hoses to break up a march of between 500 and 1,000
anti-government demonstrators in the western city of David.
Civilian sources contacted by telephone said National Civic Crusade
members were beaten, but there were no immediate reports of serious
injuries.
   A major rift appeared Thursday in the anti-Noriega opposition,
as two parties split from the opposition alliance to form their own
anti-government movement.
   Their leaders argued that U.S. economic sanctions are hurting
Panama's people more than they are damaging Noriega and the
civilian government he controls.
   Roberto Arosemena and Mauro Zuniga, leaders of the Popular
Action Party, announced formation of the Popular Civic Movement in
a break with the National Civic Crusade, an alliance of about 200
organizations that has led the 10-month-old effort to oust Noriega.
   They told a news conference their movement also is backed by the
Authentic Panamanian Party, the largest opposition political party.
   Washington has supported the Civic Crusade in its effort to
remove Noriega as chief of the 15,000-member Defense Forces, which
include the military and police. Noriega is under indictment in the
United States on drug trafficking charges, which he denies.
   Zuniga said the new movement rejects any U.S. influence.
   ``For us, no recipe that comes from Washington has been
favorable to the Panamanians,'' he said. ``The people of the world
know that the recipes formulated in the imperial capitals, the
United States and the Soviet Union, never are favorable to the
interests of the people.''
   He added: ``It is absolutely necessary for Gen. Noriega to
abandon his post. For us, this is fundamental.''
   Leaders of the two parties have joined demonstrations, strikes
and other protests of the Civic Crusade, while differing with some
of its policies and generally favoring a harder line.
   Popular Action, for example, refused to join the Crusade,
Authentic Panamanians and three other parties in agreeing to the
proposal for dialogue with the government mediated by the Catholic
church.
   The dialogue was proposed by Presidents Oscar Arias of Costa
Rica, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain and ex-presidents
Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela and Daniel Oduber of Costa Rica.
   Political parties linked most closely with the Civic Crusade are
the Democratic Christians and the Liberal Republican Nationalist
Movement, known as Molirena.
   Those two parties, the Crusade and the United States all
recognize deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle as the
constitutional head of state. Popular Action and the Authentic
Panamanian Party do not.
   Noriega orchestrated the ouster of Delvalle on Feb. 26, the day
after Delvalle tried to fire the general.
   Zuniga, brother of a former Popular Action presidential
candidate, said the movement ``will center its fight on the
original principles of the Civic Crusade.''
   ``The United States should not continue economic and military
action against Panama,'' Arosemena said. ``The Panamanian people
are capable of solving their own problems.''
   Banking and diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said bank would not open Friday even on a limited basis.
They said bankers feared the government would use their deposits if
they reopened.
   The government, whose deposits in U.S. banks have been frozen,
has not met public payrolls since the crisis began.
   The last of 1,300 additional U.S. soldiers arrived Thursday at
Howard Air Force Base outside Panama City, completing a buildup
meant to provide greater security for the Panama Canal, American
installations and U.S. citizens.
   Late Wednesday, the government said it had issued arrest
warrants for three leading opponents, including Delvalle, who has
been in hiding in Panama.
   It also asked Interpol, the international police organization,
to arrest Gabriel Lewis Galindo, a former ambassador to the United
States, and Juan B. Sosa, who was Delvalle's envoy in Washington
and remains there.
   In Washington, the State Department said Thursday the United
States ``would regard any efforts by the Noriega regime to attempt
arrests or prosecutions of President Delvalle and the others for
their activities in urging and supporting U.S. sanctions as the
unlawful acts of an illegitimate regime.''

   A woman whose son disappeared in Nevada says
police found his car abandoned on a highway four months ago but
never checked inside the trunk, where a body was discovered by a
towing company this week.
   The coroner in Las Vegas said he was completing an autopsy
Thursday to determine whether the decomposed body found in the
trunk of the red Buick is that of 25-year-old Timothy J. Dumaine.
   Las Vegas police Detective Michael Geary said the body has been
tentatively identified as Dumaine and the case is being
investigated as a homicide.
   Regina Murphy, the man's mother, said Nevada police repeatedly
assured her that no foul play was involved in the disappearance of
Dumaine, who apparently won $5,200 in a casino en route home for
Christmas but was never heard from again.
   Mrs. Murphy said she last spoke with her son on Nov. 27, when he
called from Bullhead City, Ariz., a small town on the Nevada border
about 100 miles from Las Vegas, to say he was stopping in Las Vegas
on his way East.
   Dumaine's car was found in December, police said, and sat on the
lot of Quality Towing in Las Vegas about four months before workers
noticed a strong odor and checked the trunk.
   ``They opened the trunk and found my son,'' Mrs. Murphy, 45,
said. ``I couldn't believe it. I wanted them to open that trunk for
so long and four months later they decided to open it.''
   Dumaine, who grew up in Westfield, Mass., had traveled around
the western United States, was training to become a chef and had
worked on boats, his mother said.

   Hamilton became editor of the London Sunday Times, weekly
companion of the Times of London, when Canadian Lord Thomson bought
the newspapers in 1959, as well as editorial director of the group.
He was also editor-in-chief of Times Newspapers Ltd.
   Hamilton served as chairman of Reuters from 1979 to 1985 during
the British-based agency's expansion of its financial news
services. He was also the first president from 1978 until 1983 of
the International Press Institute, an organization of more than 200
editors and publishers.
   Hamilton introduced the color magazine supplement, now a feature

   The race for best supporting actor of 1987
provides Academy voters a choice among a perspiring TV reporter, a
steely Chicago cop, a philandering Brooklyn husband, a wily New
York City pimp and a South African martyr.
   The nominees are a diverse lot, ranging from the first James
Bond to a stand-up comedian. None has ever won an Oscar.
   Sean Connery is generally considered the quintessential 007, a
role that seemed impossible for him to escape. But after 30 years
in films, he has finally been recognized for his performance as
another enforcer, the Irish beat cop Jimmy Malone in ``The
Untouchables.''
   ``I thought it was a very clever concept to take the old cop and
use him as a kind of old dog who teaches a new dog tricks,'' says
Connery of his role as mentor to the young federal agent, Kevin
Costner.
   Yet Connery is maintaining a classic Bond cool over the
possibility of winning his first Oscar. ``To be honest, I've never
really spent much time thinking about it before,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``I just go on with my work.''
   Neither is he bitter that it has taken the Academy some 40 films
to even nominate him. ``It's all a matter of timing and how your
films and image are presented,'' Connery told the Hollywood
Reporter. ``There are a lot of my films which I'm very proud of,
which I think were artistic successes, but weren't huge box office
successes like the Bond pictures.''
   There's no chance, though, that Connery will snub the Academy if
he wins. ``It'd be important to me, and I'd definitely turn up to
collect it. I'm not one of those actors who'd send along the
cleaning lady instead.''
   Morgan Freeman accomplished the near-impossible: winning a
nomination in a film released early in the year to scant notice.
His role as vicious ``Fast Black'' in ``Street Smart'' was dynamic
enough to remain in Academy voters' minds.
   Born in Memphis and raised in Greenwood, Miss., before moving to
Chicago, Freeman built up an impressive number of stage credits
before appearing in such films as ``Brubaker,'' ``Teachers'' and
``Marie.'' His performance in ``Street Smart'' prompted this
outburst from the New Yorker's Pauline Kael: ``Is Morgan Freeman
the greatest actor in America today?''
   Freeman admits to a rough life while growing up in Chicago's
South Side: ``I stole, I conned, I passed the tests. But I was
scared. I'm not the violent type.'' This contrasts the brutal role
he plays in ``Street Smart.''
   Instead of sliding into delinquency, the young Freeman found
himself attracted to acting, and sold bottles so he would have
money to go to the movies.
   Vincent Gardenia, Cher's excitable father in ``Moonstruck,'' has
been in the New York theater since 1954 and films since 1958. He
also was a member of the ``All in the Family'' cast on television.
   Gardenia was ideal casting as the Italian plumber; his family
emigrated from Naples, and he began acting in New York's Italian
theater. He was delighted with the ``Moonstruck'' script: ``It was
the first about an Italian family in a long time that you don't see
shooting, killings, bombings. It's about love, about family.''
   Denzel Washington was cast in ``Cry Freedom'' after a worldwide
search for an actor to play the vital role of Steven Biko, the
black leader who was beaten to death by South African police while
in their custody.
   Washington admits that his nomination was ``both a letdown and a
great honor.'' The letdown came because Universal Pictures had been
promoting him for best actor, and he had been nominated for a
Golden Globe in that category. He adds that his reaction wasn't the
result of an actor's ego.
   ``It has more to do with my own feelings about Steven Biko,'' he
says. ``I would like to see him in (a starring) light, and I think
most people do. He was not a supporting player.''
   Washington faced an imposing challenge: portraying a
much-admired, even revered figure while making him a believable
human being.
   ``I don't know how to play a saint,'' he says. ``I couldn't get
any advice from anyone on how to play a saint. So that was no
problem.'' Under Richard Attenborough's direction, he created a
portrait of the martyr that was both human and convincing.
   Washington said the effect of ``Cry Freedom'' on the apartheid
issue will be on a personal level.
   ``Most of the comments I've gotten from people were that they
didn't know what goes on in South Africa,'' he said. ``That's where
it will have its most important effect. I don't think it's going to
make a change in the government's attitude or the attitude of the
black people there. It's just a movie, commenting on something from
the outside.''
   Albert Brooks, the astute reporter and failed anchorman of
``Broadcast News,'' is noted for directing himself in films: ``Real
Life,'' ``Modern Romance,'' ``Lost in America.''
   Brooks, a stand-up comedian before making films, says that the
role of Aaron Altman was different from his own life: ``I don't
work in the news business. I don't have a 9 to 5 or even a 9 to 9
job. I don't wear suits. I don't have friends. ... Over a period of
four months I hung out with a dozen reporters. I think what happens
is you sort of compile little things from everybody.''

<TEXT>
   In dusty fields and stadiums across
Panama, civilians turn out by the hundreds for military training to
repel what the government says is an imminent U.S. invasion.
   ``We get political speeches, and sometimes we see patriotic
films,'' said Javier Ortega, a government housing ministry
employee. ``We do physical training and we have some weapons
instruction.''
   The volunteer units, called ``Dignity Battalions,'' formed, and
have grown, since the United States started announcing increases in
troop strength in the former Panama Canal Zone in mid-March.
   There is close-order drill, replete with slogans vowing death on
behalf of the homeland and questioning the ancestry of all Yankees.
   About 300 volunteers showed up on one field near the capital
Wednesday night, and some said it is one of the smallest battalions
in the country. The battalion in the western city of Davis is said
to have more than 1,000 participants.
   There is no reliable estimate on participation nationwide.
   In one corner of the field an instructor explained the basics of
an M-16 rifle and passed several among his charges.
   Some, but not all, handled it uncomfortably.
   ``The Americans have them with a grenade launcher attatched. Do
we have those too?'' asked one youth.
   ``Yes, we do,'' the instructor answered patiently. ``Hey, don't
point that thing at another comrade.''
   The government press is predicting loudly that the United States
will resort to invasion troops to oust Panamanian strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega. As head of the 15,000-member Panamanian
Defense forces, Noreiga is the power behind the civilian government.
   The United States normally keeps 10,000 troops in Panama to
guard the Panama Canal. In mid-March 500 military police were
added, and 1,300 more troops arrived this week.
   The stated purpose of their open-ended assignment is to provide
security for the troops, American installations and American
citizens.
   The United States said 800 Marines will start arriving Friday
for three weeks of routine jungle training. Evening papers
Wednesday ballyhooed the planned arrival but neglected to mention
the short planned stay.
   ``In Ships of Terror and Death, Contingents of War Veterans of
Vietnam and Grenada Arrive in Open Plan of Aggression and
Intimidation,'' read a headline in the government-owned Matutino
newspaper.
   ``Gringo Invaders Begin to Arrive,'' read a headline in
Wednesday's Critica, also government-owned.
   A cartoon shows Uncle Sam fleeing from gunfire from the
``popular forces,'' as the battalions also are known.
   The government closed all opposition media more than a month
ago. All that Panamanians watch, read or hear comes from newspapers
and broadcast stations owned at least partially by the government.
   Foreign newspapers brought in by travelers are confiscated at
the airport.
   The volunteer battalions are instructed by Defense Forces
troops, who appear patient and have their work cut out for them.
   Most participants appear in their late teens or early to
mid-20s. A few are easily 50. Many are women and all say they are
not paid or required to attend the two-hour evening sessions held
seven days a week.
   There is no roll call and no apparent other check of who shows
up.
   ``We fight for our homeland and our dignity. The Yankees only
fight for money,'' Ortega said.
   The instruction and the rhetoric were more reminiscent of
Nicaragua in recent years than a country where Americans have been
well-tolerated, if not always cherished, for most of this century.
   The feeling is growing, it appears, but is far from universal.
   In a shabbier sector of downtown Panama City a woman held up two
shotgun shells fired by police during a minor demonstration.
   ``This is what they shoot at the people, like they are beasts,''
she said as the tear gas lifted. ``We've had it up to here.
   ``Panamanians are tired of this. We want the gringos to attack _
not tomorrow, today.''
   ``Tonight,'' suggested a young man in a crowd that was gathering
near two journalists.
   But those on the drill field felt otherwise.
   ``We believe an American invasion is close, very close,'' said
Frank Quintero.
   Quintero, an office holder in the nearby municipality of San
Miguelito, speaks sincerely of American bodies going back to their
home towns and said he is not worried about weapons availability.
   ``In revolutions in Mexico, Cuba, Nicaragua and El Salvador they
didn't worry about weapons,'' he said. ``They took them from their
dead enemies.''

<TEXT>
   A curious new program is going out over
Poland's state radio every Monday morning.
   It's called ``The West Speaks,'' and it is composed entirely of
excerpts of Polish-language broadcasts by Radio Free Europe, the
Voice of America, the British Broadcasting Corp. and other Western
radio stations.
   The segments are broadcast without comment or counterpoint, but
since the program went on the air the Polish media and officials
have criticized the Western broadcasts with greater frequency.
   The Western stations always have been characterized here as
hostile propaganda tools, but the Communist government says ``The
West Speaks'' is one way to counter the influence of the broadcasts
that deliver a mixture of uncensored news, features and commentary.
   Poland stopped the electronic jamming of Western broadcasts Jan.
1 and Poles now can freely tune in to them.
   But government authorities have been raising the question of
their fairness with Western officials, including the director of
the U.S. Information Agency, Charles Z. Wick, who was here on a
visit in March.
   The authorities say that in the struggle for the hearts and
minds of the Polish people, they cannot afford to overlook the
influence of the Western stations.
   ``It doesn't matter how many people listen to it when it is
something very dangerous,'' government spokesman Jerzy Urban said
in an interview. ``Even if it's only 100 people, that is enough,
because the report will spread.''
   At one time, particularly during the Cold War years in the
1950s, it was a crime to listen to the Western stations.
   Today, however, the strains of ``Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' the
sign-on tune of the Voice of America, can be heard coming from
apartments in housing blocks.
   Urban said Polish authorities believed that countering the
broadcasts with ``polemics and arguments'' was better than
continuing the jamming.
   A public opinion poll quoted by the official news agency PAP
said 80 percent of respondents approved the decision to end the
jamming, but it said the number of listeners has not risen
significantly.
   How many people actually listen remains a matter of dispute.
   According to a survey quoted by Urban, the percentage of Poles
who listen to Radio Free Europe either regularly or occasionally is
16 percent, up 2 percentage points since jamming ended. Only 3
percent, or 1.2 million out of the population of 37.5 million,
listen as often as once a week, he said.
   But the Board for International Broadcasting, the body that
oversees Radio Free Europe in Munich, West Germany, says 59 percent
of Poles listen to its broadcasts occasionally and nearly 14
percent at least once a week.
   An informal survey of half a dozen Warsaw residents indicated
that most preferred the Voice of America or the BBC to Radio Free
Europe, known as RFE, on grounds that their information was more
reliable.
   Recent RFE broadcasts were heavy with reports of demonstrations
and protests in Poland, speeches and statements by leaders of the
outlawed Solidarity trade union and accounts of opposition
activities in other countries of the Soviet bloc.
   ``The West Speaks'' was conceived ``to show what sort of
argumentation is used by these stations,'' said Witold Stankowski,
an executive of Polish Radio One.
   He said the show, which premiered in October, was given a time
slot when ``we have a pretty good audience,'' but said he could not
judge its popularity or say how long it would be continued.
   In recent months a drumbeat of commentaries have shown up on the
PAP service and in state-run newspapers disputing specific news
items on the Western stations. Urban has made denunciations of the
broadcasts almost a fixture at his weekly news conferences.
   In the interview, Urban noted that listenership tends to rise in
times of public anxiety, such as during the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
accident in the Soviet Union.
   He claimed RFE's ``disgraceful methods'' frightened people in
its reports on Chernobyl and in its coverage of Poland's
announcement in late January of price increases totaling 42 percent
in 1988.
   ``Radio Free Europe presents the opinion that prices in fact
will go up twice as much,'' he said. ``They want to cause, and
really do cause, an increase in wage demands.''
   U.S. Ambassador John Davis defends the broadcasts.
   ``The great bulk of what goes out seems to me to be a repetition
of what already has been published in the West,'' he said. ``It is
broadcast in, sometimes with comment, and comment is fair game.''
   Wick, the USIA director who arrived in Poland on March 23 for a
series of talks with Polish officials, said the Polish side raised
objections about Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America and the
complaints were discussed ``very forthrightly.''
   Wick said the Voice of America, which is part of USIA, and Radio
Free Europe, which is privately opeated but largely funded by the
U.S. government, have charters that mandate that they be
``objective and accurate.''
   ``I invited the authorities to give me specific instances when
they were not,'' he said.
   He added that editorials on Radio Free Europe and the Voice of
America are not intended to be objective, but to ``reflect the
editorial viewpoint of the United States government.''
   As such, he said, they might not be pleasing to Poland.

   The ladies of the club _ Women Always Stung
for Presents Society _ are throwing a bash today, and as usual the
guests of honor are themselves.
   The dozen or so retired school secretaries plan to treat
themselves to a fancy lunch, toast their single status and present
themselves with an extra special gift.
   That's for the years and years of giving presents to their
married friends, but never getting anything back.
   ``This is really to treat ourselves because no one else really
has,'' explained Betty Kieffer, 63, who's serving as the queen, or
organizer, of today's gathering of the society, otherwise known as
WASPS.
   ``Oh, Lordy, every time you turn around you're giving gifts.
Wedding gifts and baby gifts and shower gifts. You couldn't begin
to count them. You're giving all the time, but you're not getting
anything in return,'' said Alma Eck Mullen, 81, a founding member
of the 38-year-old society.
   Miss Kieffer is giving herself a new white coat. Mrs. Mullen, a
widow who married late in life, is celebrating with a watch on a
necklace.
   Gifts can be whatever the women need or want. Over the years,
presents have included diamond rings, new cars, houses, European
vacations, even a custom-made girdle.
   ``She was quite a heavy girl and she could never get a girdle to
fit her. So she had one made,'' Mrs. Mullen said Thursday.
   Each woman writes a poem, to herself naturally, and gives
herself a card that reads, ``I love me.'' They also sing this peppy
tune:
   ``That's where our money's spent, on all the gals who went. We
bought them everything to keep them supplied. We think the time is
due to get a gift or two. So WASPS let's see what you brought you.''
   The conversation covers just about everything except for
children, grandchildren and, of course, men.
   ``That's why it's so nice. I don't have to listen to stories
about everybody's wonderful grandchildren,'' Miss Kieffer said,
laughing.
   The members, ranging in age from their mid-50s to late 80s, have
been gathering every April since 1950, when Mrs. Mullen and 23
other never-wed secretaries for the Pittsburgh Public Schools
decided enough was enough.
   They formed the society after learning about a similar group in
Des Moines, Iowa. To be eligible, women had to be single and
employed as a secretary for the Pittsburgh Public Schools for at
least 10 years.
   ``If you were married, somebody would have had some plush party
for you. So that was it. We'd be the contributors,'' Mrs. Mullen
said. ``But you could be married after that because once a WASP,
always a WASP.''
   Howard Carroll, a spokesman for the National Education
Association, says the society likely has its roots in the days when
female teachers in some parts of the country were barred from
saying ``I do.''
   ``They just extended themselves through their kids'' in school,
he said.
   The Women Always Stung for Presents Society grew to more than 60
members around 1970, but has since dwindled to 14, seven of them
founding members. Two women are now married. Mrs. Mullen is the
only widow.
   ``A lot of them (members) have died,'' Mrs. Mullen said.
   Secretaries nowadays simply aren't interested.
   ``They don't want to have that brand,'' Jane Viehman, 69, said.
``To say they've been working for 10 years and they aren't married,
I guess it's terrible. It doesn't bother me, but it does some
people.''
   The society meets once a year on April Fools' Day. The date was
pushed back this year since Good Friday fell on April 1.
   The restaurant get-togethers are mandatory and planned months in
advance. Members who can drive pick up those who can't. Just about
everybody comes freshly coiffed and sporting a new outfit.
   ``We enjoy seeing each other because who knows who will be there
next year,'' Miss Kieffer said.
   ``Our girls are all getting older,'' Mrs. Mullen agreed. ``But
we always say if there's one left, that one will go. We'll keep it
up.''

<HEAD>Jury Convicts Former Mecham Aide Of Extortion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jury on Thursday convicted former U.S.
Rep. Sam Steiger of theft by extortion for threatening a parole
board member to get his vote on a personnel matter while serving in
the Evan Mecham administration.
   ``Any time you go to court you can expect a guilty verdict, but
it's difficult to believe,'' Steiger said in the courtroom moments
after the jury returned its verdict.
   Steiger, who was a top aide to the now-ousted Republican
governor, was accused of threatening Ron Johnson, a member of the
state Board of Pardons and Paroles.
   Steiger allegedly threatened to withhold permission for Johnson
to work as a part-time Tempe justice of the peace and to remove him
from the board unless he voted to retain as executive director
Patricia Costello, a Mecham appointee.
   Judge Ronald Reinstein of Maricopa County Superior Court
scheduled a May 6 sentencing for the 59-year-old Steiger, who faces
up to five years in prison.
   Asked whether the verdict would be appealed, defense attorney
Thomas Karas said, ``We'll take it one step at a time.'' Steiger
said, ``That's up to counsel.''
   Jury foreman Greg Jones, a fire captain in suburban Mesa, said
the deciding factor behind the verdict was ``the tapes of the phone
call between Steiger and Johnson.'' Johnson called Steiger at home
from the office of the state attorney general, who taped the call.
   During testimony Monday, Steiger denied that he threatened
Johnson or told him how he should vote.
   But the state alleged that Steiger followed up on the alleged
threat in a letter and a telephone conversation after Johnson voted
with the board majority to seek Ms. Costello's resignation.
   The board voted 4-3 that Ms. Costello should step down because
of low staff morale.
   Steiger, a former five-term congressman, testified that he did
suggest that Johnson should back Ms. Costello but denied that he
tried to ``steal'' Johnson's vote by threatening his job.
   Karas had asked Reinstein to declare a mistrial, contending the
conviction of Mecham at his state Senate impeachment trial Monday
might prejudice jurors against Steiger. However, Reinstein ruled
that great care had been taken to select unbiased jurors.
   Steiger gave up his 3rd Congressional District seat in 1976 to
run unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate as a Republican.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Defendants Argue Both Directions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh is being
attacked in opposite directions by the Iran-Contra defendants, with
one claiming he improperly ignored congressional testimony and the
other three saying he illegally used it.
   Attorneys representing former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and arms dealer Albert Hakim
moved Thursday to dismiss the indictment against them, claiming
Walsh illegally relied on testimony the three gave last year to the
Iran-Contra congressional committees after being granted limited
immunity. Because of the immunity grants, Walsh was required to
collect all of his evidence independently.
   North, Piondexter and Hakim claim that, given the massive
publicity surrounding the hearings, Walsh's case was inevitably
tainted by exposure to their immunized _ regardless of efforts to
insulate investigators and grand jurors from that evidence.
   But lawyers for retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord,
the fourth defendant, claim that Walsh unfairly ignored the
congressional testimony of North and Poindexter. They say that
testimony would have led the grand jury to decline to name their
client in the 23-count indictment.
   Secord, who brokered the arms sales with Hakim, was the lead
witness at last year's televised hearings of the House and Senate
Iran-Contra committees and testified without any immunity.
   All four defendants are accused of conspiring to divert profits
illegally from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The so-called ``use immunity'' grants conferred by Congress on
North, Poindexter and Hakim prohibit Walsh from using evidence
obtained directly or indirectly from their congressional testimony.
   Walsh imposed special precautions to prevent his staff and the
grand jury from being exposed to the extensive publicity
surrounding the hearings. Prosecutors and grand jurors alike were
told to ignore news reports or conversations with friends about the
hearings.
   Evidence was filed under seal in U.S. District Court to prove
that it was obtained independently of the immunized testimony.
   But in pleadings filed with U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell, lawyers for North, Poindexter and Hakim said those
precautions were not enough.
   ``Never in the history of this nation has the immunized
testimony of putative defendants been broadcast live, on all major
networks, to tens of millions of viewers and listeners,'' the
defense said.
   ``Given the widespread dissemination of immunized testimony
throughout our society, the broad use of immunized testimony has
been inevitable, undeniable, and so pervasive that the indictment
must be dismissed as a matter of law,'' the defense argued.
   As an alternative to dismissing the charges, the defense asked
Gesell to conduct a hearing to determine if immunized congressional
testimony influenced Walsh's investigation.
   The defense says it wants to question grand jurors to determine
if they learned about the congressional hearings from friends,
relatives or news broadcasts or from grand jury witnesses.
   Secord's lawyers are taking a different course. They contend
that Walsh unfairly refused to consider the congressional testimony
of North and Poindexter, which they contend would vindicate their
client of any wrongdoing.
   The grand jury should have had an opportunity to consider this
testimony before returning an indictment against Secord, his
lawyers said.
   ``The independent counsel's decision to exalt prosecutorial
convenience above General Secord's Fifth Amendment right to a fair
and informed grand jury taints the proceedings against him and
requires, as a matter of fundamental fairness, that the indictment
be dismissed,'' Secord's lawyers said.
   Gesell has scheduled a hearing next Tuesday to discuss the
immunity issue, which could take months to resolve.

<HEAD>Longtime Washington Star Editor Dead At 67</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crosby S. Noyes, a longtime reporter and
editor for The Washington Star, died Thursday after a heart attack.
He was 67.
   Noyes, who began his career as a reporter for the Star in 1947
and went on to become chief European correspondent and then foreign
editor, died at Sibley Memorial Hospital.
   When Noyes joined the newspaper's staff, his family had been
associated with it for almost 100 years. He specialized in foreign
affairs from the start, making various reporting trips to Europe
and opening the paper's Paris bureau in 1954.
   He was in the United States from 1956-1958, then returned to
Paris and reported from Europe until 1964, when he became foreign
editor.
   Noyes was ``especially good at putting complicated foreign
issues in understandable terms,'' said Charles Seib, a former
managing editor of the Star.
   Noyes won the National Headliner Club award in 1958 for foreign
reporting for a series on the rise of Gen. Charles de Gaulle to
president of France.
   Noyes retired in 1974, when the Noyes and Kauffmann families,
which had controlled the newspaper since 1867, sold it to Joe L.
Albritton. Albritton later sold the paper to Time Inc., which
closed it in 1981.
   Noyes, who lived in Bethesda, Md., was born in Washington and
graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H., and Yale
University.
   He served in the Army Air Forces during World War II, and after
becoming a flier was assigned to instruct Free French pilots in the
United States. He later flew combat in Europe and was awarded the
Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal.
   Noyes is survived by his wife, the former Letitia Hughson, and
four children, two brothers and a half-sister.

<HEAD>Biology May Explain Why Some Children Are Bashful, Say Researchers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Extremely shy children and those who are very
outgoing may be responding to a biological rhythm set at birth and
continued throughout life, researchers say in a study published
today.
   A scientist from Yale and two from Harvard said in a study
published in the journal Science that extremely inhibited children
experience a more rapid heart beat, a dilation of the pupils and
increased muscular tension when they encounter novel experiences or
social stresses.
   ``It appears that a small percentage of children are born with a
biological disposition that would tend to make them shy, and this
is independent of what the parent has or has not done,'' said
Steven Reznick, a Yale University psychologist.
   Although the study postulated a ``biological constitution'' for
shyness, Reznick emphasized that this finding ``in no way indicates
that (the shy) child will not be successful.''
   ``They learn to compensate,'' Reznick said. ``They may learn
strategies that would make them appear not to be shy.''
   Reznick and Harvard University researchers Jerome Kagan and
Nancy Snidman drew these conclusions from a series of tests that
followed a group of children from the age 20 months to 7{ years.
   Ms. Snidman said in an interview that the scientists determined
which children were extremely shy and which were outgoing by
observing their response to novel situations in a playroom.
   ``Does the child immediately go to the center of the room and
start playing, or does the child stay close to the mother? If a
stranger walks in, does the child retreat to his mother, or go over
and approach the stranger?'' said Ms. Snidman.
   The researchers also observed how the children reacted to new
toys, to youngsters unknown to them, and how often the children
spoke.
   ``If you took a random sample of children, you would find about
10 percent at either end of the scale,'' Ms. Snidman said. ``The
rest of the children will do a little of both _ that's most
children.''
   After identifying the shy and the outgoing children, the
researchers tested them for physiological reactions. They found
that the shy youngsters tended to have faster heart rates that
accelerated more rapidly in the presence of novel situations. Heart
rates for the uninhibited children were among the lowest.
   Shy children also experienced marked dilation of the pupils, a
rise in a body chemical that is produced during stress, and a
change in the voice quality caused by muscle tenseness.
   This fundamental pattern remained consistent through all the
years of the study, said Ms. Snidman, although ``as these children
grow older, you see the behavior responses in different ways.''
   When the children were 7{, the scientists conducted a party for
three shy youngsters, another three who were uninhibited and four
who were in between.
   ``We find that the children whom we classified as inhibited at
20 months were the children in this party situation who tended to
stay a little distant from the other children and not talk as much
in the free play situation,'' said Ms. Snidman.
   Although it has yet to be demonstrated by study, Reznick said
``it would seem reasonable to believe that the biological
differences would continue through life.''
   But such a person, said Ms. Snidman, ``can learn to cope very
well.''
   ``Some children who are very inhibited have parents who are very
understanding and deal with it very well,'' she said. ``Those
children look less inhibited as they get older.''
   The shy child may be very successful in school, said Ms.
Snidman. ``They are quiet and attentive. Teachers love them.''

   A mock newspaper scribbled in a notebook by John
Lennon at the age of 18 sold for nearly $22,500 at an auction of
rock and pop music memorabilia, Sotheby's auctioneers said.
   A flame-shaped bass guitar used by John Entwistle of ``The Who''
surprised bidders by selling for 15,000 pounds ($28,005) at
Thursday's sale, which yielded a total of 188,694 pounds ($352,291).
   Three manuscripts for songs by Lennon, who was shot to death in
New York City in 1980 at the age of 40, also drew high prices.
   In the four-page mock newspaper written in a school notebook,
Lennon wrote nonsense and comic text and poetry and drew cartoons
in crayon. It was called the Daily Howl and priced at 1 penny or
``a halfpenny to the vicar.''
   Sotheby's called it an important stylistic landmark to be
compared with Lennon's later written works.
   The Entwistle guitar _ one of 140 in his collection and five up
for auction _ was sold to an unidentified buyer. The guitarist, who
attended the auction, said he decided to put the instruments up for
sale because they were taking up too much space in his house.
   Lennon's manuscript lyrics for the 1964 song ``If I Fell'' were
purchased by a California client for 7,800 pounds, and his
manuscript for the 1964 tune ``Any Time at All'' was purchased by
an anonymous person for 6,000 pounds.
   A Japanese Beatles Fan Club linked to the auction by satellite
purchased 19 of the 250 items on sale for 8,000 pounds.
   Japanese coordinator Mariko Fujiwara said ``the Beatles are very
popular in Japan,'' partly because Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono, is
Japanese.

<TEXT>
   As if Britain's yuppies didn't have enough to
worry about in the fallout from the stock market crash, they're now
faced with anarchists plotting a ``National Anti-Yuppie Day.''
   Adding to the misery of yuppie job losses, pay cuts and
dwindling stock portfolios is Class War, an anarchists' group,
which announced a 22-city rock concert tour in Britain for August
dubbed ``Rock against the Rich.''
   It said in a statement made available Thursday to The Associated
Press that it hopes the tour will culminate in an anti-yuppie
extravaganza on Sept. 10.
   Just who Class War is has never been clear. ``It's not a club
you join,'' said a sympathizer, who gave his name only as Sean.
   Nor has the size of its membership been divulged.
   Group members sometimes surface in anti-capitalist stunts like a
1984 campaign in which bank windows were smashed, a smoke bomb
exploded near the Bank of England and about 470 people were
arrested.
   But why pick on yuppies? Class War explained: ``All over
Britain, a plague of yuppies are descending on working-class
communities like locusts. The time to resist is now _ let's Rock
Against the Rich.''
   In a telephone interview, Sean said it was ``because people have
been pushed out from areas where they have always lived because of
greed on the part of speculators, because it isn't possible to
afford to buy somewhere to live in London unless you have a hell of
a lot of money.''
   The story of the anti-yuppie campaign was broken, appropriately
enough, in the Independent newspaper, London's newest daily and a
favorite among yuppies. Its good-natured report Thursday on Class
War's manifesto said: ``With this defiant, if ungrammatical,
declaration, a new musical movement has been launched.''
   But the newspaper wrote: ``Rock Against the Rich seems very
unlikely to raise anything like the level of support given by
musicians and audiences to the anti-fascist Rock Against Racism in
the 1970s or pro-Labor (Party) Red Wedge rock tours before the last
general election.''
   The concerts are to be held in cities, like Edinburgh, Scotland,
and Exeter, England, whose run-down inner areas are being
``gentrified'' by wealthy young newcomers, Sean said.
   An exception is Guildford, the heart of the stockbroker belt
south of London, where the concert has been dubbed, ``Rock Against
Stockbrokers.''
   The planned anti-yuppie day's main attraction is an outdoor rock
concert in the Docklands, in London's East End, where gentrifiers
have been clashing with the local residents, the group said.
   Docklands developers say they have rescued the area from
irreversible decline and provided affordable housing for local
residents.
   Joe Strummer, previously guitarist with The Clash, a 1970s rock
group, has agreed to join the tour, as well as other, less
well-known musicians, Class War said.
   The group is targeting yuppies because ``they come off flaunting
wealth when there's none there to start with,'' Sean said.
   London's yuppie class grew visibly during Big Bang, the huge
deregulation of Britain's financial markets in 1986. Expanding
investment firms paid top money to attract brokers and bankers, and
many yuppie-haters reacted with glee to the stock market crash last
October.
   Britain still suffers from class antagonisms and the tug-of-war
between capitalism and socialism continues unabated.
   Some see Class War as just another manifestation of British
eccentricity. Others see a more sinister side in the group's
reported support for ``taxing'' yuppies by mugging and burglarizing
them.
   Class War is ``tapping real feeling in the East End,'' Nick
Cohen, who wrote about the group for the Independent, said in a
telephone interview.
   But ``it's hard to know what their real influence is. Opinions
vary on the left about whether they are publicity-seeking idiots or
whether they are doing anything, even on the far left.''
   ``Their rhetoric is quite nasty,'' Cohen added. ``Nobody else
(political groups) will have anything to do with them.''

<TEXT>
   A hearing on a commuter airline crash
that killed 18 people focused Thursday on why the Federal Aviation
Administration reduced a staff member's recommendation of a
$250,000 fine to $16,500.
   The FAA official had recommended the fine against Ryan Air
Service for more about 250 safety and records violations. The
airline has been cited or fined several times for paperwork and
safety violations in recent years.
   A tail-heavy, overloaded Ryan Air Beech 1900 crashed Nov. 23 at
the Homer Airport in the country's worst commuter airline crash in
19 years. Eighteen people died and only three survived.
   National Transporation Safety Board members and their aides
spent Thursday questioning FAA employees about the crash, the 10th
Ryan Air accident in eight years. Four involved fatalities.
   Ryan Air, now seeking protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of federal bankruptcy laws, was grounded in January as part of a
consent agreement with the FAA. Before the agreement, Ryan Air was
Alaska's largest commuter airline, serving more than 80 cities and
communities.
   The investigators tried to piece together why three of the
company's pilots who volunteered to provide records concerning
overloaded flights in exchange for immunity were rebuffed by the
FAA. One of the pilots, Robert Deliman, was killed in the Homer
crash.
   Lou Gossen, an FAA operations inspector, said he conducted a
week-long inspection in February 1987 and found scores of
discrepancies in record keeping, pilot competency checks and
training records. He recommended a $250,000 civil penalty _ $1,000
per violation.
   ``That's the largest civil penalty I've ever recommended,'' he
testified. ``I felt like a high civil penalty would have more or as
much impact as a (flight certificate) suspension.''
   His former boss, Richard Gordon, testified he supported the
recommendation.
   The suggested fine was passed up the line, but was bounced back
with instructions to gather more evidence. Gossen said he again
submitted the recommendation. It was rejected by former FAA
regional counsel Donald Boberick.
   Gossen said he tried again, reducing the suggested penalty to
$25,000. Boberick reduced the fine to $16,500.
   Thomas Westall, the FAA's director of flight standards in
Anchorage told the board the proposed fine was reduced because of
``purely legal defects.''
   Courts in the past have not supported the notion of a $1,000
fine per violation, he said.
   Westall said he first supported the proposed $250,000 fine, but
then changed his mind after talking with Boberick. ``In this case,
he convinced me,'' Westall said.
   The $16,500 fine will not be assessed unless the airline again
gets airborne, FAA spokesman Paul Steucke said.
   Despite his airline's history of problems, Wilfred Ryan Jr., who
was forced from his position as president of Ryan Air by the
January consent order, testified Wednesday his company had been the
target of FAA harassment.
   ``Ryan Air was our largest carrier, so they got a larger part of
our inspections,'' Gordon said Thursday. ``I don't think Ryan Air
was over inspected because of the size and complexity of their
operation.''
   After the November crash, the airline was cited by the FAA for
flying Beech 1900s that were tail-heavy at least four times in the
month before the fatal accident.

   The Reagan administration must answer tough
questions about whether its support for the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels led it to wink at multimillion-dollar drug deals, Sen. John
F. Kerry says.
   The Foreign Relations subcommittee headed by Kerry, D-Mass., has
heard a week of testimony about the daring night-time flights and
huge profits made by cocaine and marijuana traffickers, along with
allegations that U.S. officials knew about some of the trafficking
but did nothing to halt it.
   Two convicted drug smugglers testified Thursday that weapons
were illegally flown to Costa Rica for the Contras and hundreds of
pounds of cocaine were brought back on the return flights. The
Contras have denied that they were involved in illegal drug
trafficking.
   ``I think it is important to look at the link between the
Contras and drugs,'' Kerry said Thursday, ``but this is not meant
to be focused on the Contra effort. The issue is whether a specific
foreign policy goal (aiding the Contras) assumed a larger-than-life
importance so that some things were permitted that should not have
been.''
   Kerry chairs the Foreign Relations subcommittee on narcotics and
terrorism, which is investigating the relationship between Latin
American governments and the drug trade.
   ``I think what we've shown is that there is an enormous amount
more that needs to be done to improve enforcement of the drug
laws,'' said Kerry. ``You can't ever stop it, but you can slow it
down with more effective enforcement.''
   Gary Betzner, who is serving a 27-year prison sentence for drug
trafficking, testified Thursday that he had twice flown planeloads
of weapons from Florida to Costa Rica in July 1984. The weapons
were replaced with hundreds of pounds of cocaine, he said.
   As Betzner described his career flying illegal drugs from South
America, he described a series of high-risk trips in which he flew
at wave-top level to avoid radar.
   He said that on one occasion, he entered Miami by flying between
high-rise condominium buildings along the city's coastline. On
another occasion, he said, mechanical and navigational troubles
forced him to fly over Cuba, where he was chased by MiG-19 jets
until he dived down to tree-top level.
   The profits were huge, according to Betzner, who said he was
paid to $200,000 per planeload for delivering drugs to the United
States.
   Betzner's story was echoed by George Morales, a Colombian native
who says he began dealing drugs in 1979. Within several years, he
had made enough money to build an empire that included a fleet of
10 to 15 planes, helicopters, and speedy boats.
   Betzner is serving a 27-year prison term for cocaine
trafficking, while Morales is doing a 16-year term for his
conviction on the same charge.
   Morales said he gave the Contras ``several million dollars''
from his drug profits. On one occasion, he estimated the amount at
between $3 million and $4 million, but he later said the figure was
$5 million to $6 million.
   Morales also said he arranged six times between 1984 and 1986 to
ship weapons from the United States to the Contras because he said
Contra officials who claimed to be CIA operatives promised to try
to get drug charges dropped against him.
   Both Morales and Betzner said the weapons were delivered to an
airstrip near a northern Costa Rican ranch owned by John Hull, an
American who has been linked to both the Contras and the CIA.
   Hull met the plane each time and watched as the small arms,
including M-16 rifles, mines and C-4 explosives, were unloaded,
Betzner said. The plane was then loaded with cocaine, Betzner said,
and he flew back to Florida. He estimated that he carried about 500
kilograms (1,100 pounds) of cocaine on each return flight.
   ABC News on Thursday described a network that it said shipped
Eastern European arms to the Contras and Latin American drugs to
the United States.
   Citing unidentified U.S., Panamanian and Israeli sources, the
network said that from 1983 to 1986 Israeli agents, with U.S.
financial support, purchased arms in Poland and Czechoslovakia,
shipped them from Yugoslavia to Bolivia and on to Panama.
   From there, the network said, the arms were flown to Contra
supply drops in El Salvador and Costa Rica. ABC said the same
planes and pilots then flew illegal drugs from Panama and Colombia
to the United States.
   The network said the operation was launched with $20 million in
Israeli government money, which was later reimbursed from U.S.
covert funds.
   ABC said Michael Harreri, an Israeli liaison who also served as
an aide to Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, was the
middleman. It said former CIA agent Felix Rodriguez was the
American connection.
   ABC said the Israeli government denied Thursday that it supplied
arms to the Contras and Rodriguez has denied he was involved in
such a supply network.

<HEAD>Kirk Seeks To Minimize Clashes Over Platform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Democratic Chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr.
says he wants to minimize the clash of interest groups so his party
can draft a 1988 platform that Democrats ``can run with and not shy
away from.''
   But Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard, chairman of the platform
committee, says at least one interest group will be courted this
year: the business community.
   ``They think socially they have to be Republicans, for whatever
reason. But the majority are really independent people,'' Blanchard
said. ``I would like to see special efforts with the business
community.''
   Kirk and Blanchard said Thursday there will be state and
regional platform hearings around the country over the next two
months.
   Some interest groups said they welcomed this news, since Kirk
earlier suggested there might be only two _ in Washington and
Atlanta.
   But they scoffed at what they called an effort to keep
controversial planks out of the platform.
   ``We are concerned about statements that they did not wish to
cater to special interests, they want to open up the process and to
bring in new groups,'' said Molly Yard, president of the National
Association for Women.
   ``It seems to us that business is also a special interest, and
we don't understand quite how women, who are over half the
population, can be categorized as a special interest.''
   Kirk and Blanchard pledged to draft a lean document and avoid
the kind of divisive battles that have marked previous efforts at
writing party platforms.
   ``I'd like to think that someone will read it other than
opponents,'' Blanchard said. ``The platform is more than just what
Michael Dukakis or Jesse Jackson thinks. It has to be one all
Democrats are comfortable with.''
   Even so, Kirk said that Jackson would have ``significant
representation'' on the platform committee, regardless of who
becomes the party nominee. He called Jackson's campaign ``an
important constructive force within the Democratic party.''
   At the same time, Kirk seemed to soften suggestions he made last
December that platform writers would avoid emotionally charged
issues on which there was not common agreement.
   He vowed Thursday the party would not ``sound a retreat'' from
issues it had championed in the past, including the Equal Rights
Amendment and abortion rights.
   Asked specifically about abortion, Kirk said: ``I think our
party has always embraced the rights of privacy, the rights of
individual choice.''
   However, he tempered his comments by saying that such issues
``can be addressed in a way without being divisive or
controversial.''
   ``I think we can put together a platform that a national
audience can respond to and that all elected Democratic officials
can run with and not shy away from,'' Kirk said.
   ``I would have been much happier if he said, `we will of course
keep equal rights and abortion planks,'' said Eleanor Smeal,
president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority.
   Turning to the Democratic campaign, Kirk joined New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo in urging Sen. Albert Gore Jr. to tone down his
negative campaigning. He called Cuomo's admonition to the Tennessee
senator to stop criticizing Jackson and Dukakis ``helpful and on
course.''
   Kirk also reiterated his view that Cuomo would not become a
presidential candidate, even in a brokered convention. ``There is a
game going on on the field,'' he said. ``That's where the nominee's
going to be be chosen from.''

   A mentally ill man killed by police was merely
pretending to hold his teen-age girlfriend captive and used toy
guns during a three-hour standoff, authorities said Thursday.
   The guns 19-year-old Israel Ramos held to the girl's head and
brandished at police from the window of his second-floor apartment
were plastic water pistols and the ``hostage situation was a
charade,'' York County District Attorney H. Stanley Rebert said at
a news conference.
   The 15-year-old girl, a York County runaway whose name was not
released, was a willing participant, he said. Officials did not
discuss the motive behind the charade.
   A police marksman shot Ramos once in the abdomen and he died
several hours later at York Hospital.
   Police originally said the marksman fired when Ramos threatened
to kill the girl. But film taken by WGAL-TV in Lancaster showed
Ramos was shot seconds after yelling, ``I'm coming out'' and
placing both hands on a window frame. No gun was in sight.
   Rebert and other officials refused to identify the officer who
fired the fatal shot. They said he was on administrative leave
without pay, pending the outcome of an investigation that is
expected to last up to four weeks.
   The officials refused to say if any charges would be filed
against the teen-ager.

   Spring is in the air and so is courting _
especially among the Democratic presidential hopefuls as they woo
the party's unpledged delegates to the national convention.
   Faced with the possibility that the primary process will not
produce a clear-cut delegate leader, the candidates are focusing on
the 645 ``super delegates'' who could tip the balance in Atlanta
July 18-21.
   Campaign brochures, news clippings and position papers fill the
mailboxes of the super delegates _ 25 governors, 362 Democratic
National Committee members, 253 members of Congress and five elder
statesmen _ who could push a candidate closer to the 2,082 total
needed to nominate.
   Some campaigns rely on phone calls, such as those made to
Patricia Russell, a Democratic national committeewoman from Keene,
N.H., who remains uncommitted.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis phoned twice and his wife,
Kitty, called too. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s staff called as
well. Mrs. Russell says she has heard from all the candidates
except Jesse Jackson.
   Since last fall, the Dukakis campaign has been laying the
foundation with the super delegates through phone calls, mailings
and personal contact, said delegate counter Tad Devine. In recent
weeks, aides have stepped up the pressure.
   ``It's much more focused, an intense effort,'' Devine said.
``When it looks like he's pulling away ... at that time we'll seek
a more formal pledge of support.''
   The Gore campaign has relied on congressional communication on
Capitol Hill as well as phone calls and mailings to the delegates,
said Richard Hutcheson, delegate counter for the senator.
   ``There's great potential among the super delegates,'' said
Hutcheson, who describes the field as ``fertile territory'' for his
candidate. ``The super delegates are most interested in a ticket
that can win.''
   The Jackson forces, however, are just getting started in their
campaign for super delegates.
   ``I looked into what kind of a strategy he had to deal with them
and who he had doing it,'' said John White, former chairman of the
Democratic National Committee who is advising Jackson. ``It turns
out they apparently had very little. There's some mail being passed
back and forth.''
   ``It's something they have to do and they're probably very late
in doing it,'' he said.
   Rep. Mickey Leland of Texas, a member of the congressional Black
Caucus, said last week he will lead the Jackson effort to court the
super delegates.
   ``The front line is the congressional Black Caucus ... to talk
to our colleagues in our states, to lobby people who are super
delegates,'' Leland said.
   Jackson contends that if he leads in pledged delegates after the
last primaries on June 7, he deserves the support of the super
delegates and should get the nomination.
   ``We know that the super votes give rise to super delegates,''
Jackson said last week after meeting with a select group of
Democratic leaders. ``The delegates must respect and respond to the
will of the people.
   ``If we do not believe that, why have a primary? Have a
super-delegate convention and let the super delegates choose
someone of their own,'' he said.
   Willie Brown, California Assembly speaker and Jackson's national
campaign chairman, said the campaign would use primary results to
convince the super delegates.
   ``We will take the popular vote in their state or their district
and say this is a factor you should consider,'' Brown said.
   The constant communication _ by telephone and by mail _ is all
too familiar to some super delegates.
   ``They don't call on a per day basis,'' said Richard Gerber, an
uncommitted super delegate from Norristown, Pa. ``They called
before and after Michigan, before and after Connecticut. They tell
us how well the candidates are doing.''
   Elizabeth Smith of Washington, D.C., said the campaigns phone to
find out ``if there's anything I want to know about the candidate,
if I'm getting the mailings. They're very diplomatic.''
   Dora Olivo, an uncommitted super delegate from Rosenberg, Texas,
has received ``a lot of calls from Dukakis,'' and expects it to get
``hot and heavy'' as the convention nears.
   Other delegates say the courting hasn't even begun in earnest.
   Charles Gifford of Des Moines, Iowa, a former supporter of
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, said he hadn't heard from any
campaign since his candidate dropped out of the race two weeks ago.
   And Bella Abzug, a former congresswoman from New York City, said
she's heard from all the campaigns, but ``I don't think they're
vigorously working on it.''

<HEAD>Top Justice Nominee Under Fire for All-White, All-Male Clubs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese's choice to
become the No. 2 official in the Justice Department is under fire
for his membership in an all-male athletic club and an all-white
country club.
   ``It makes it hard to imagine he'll be able to administer
justice in government in a way that's non-discriminatory when in
his own personal life he doesn't live up to that,'' Patricia
Ireland, executive vice president of the National Organization for
Women, said of John C. Shepherd.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on whether to confirm
Shepherd as deputy attorney general, if President Reagan goes ahead
and nominates him. Committee members said Thursday that it is too
soon to comment on Shepherd's membership in the Missouri Athletic
Club, which has no female members, and the Bellerive Country Club,
which has no blacks. Both are in the St. Louis area.
   Shepherd, 62, a St. Louis attorney, could not be reached for
comment Thursday. He was not in his office, and his home phone
number is unlisted. But on Wednesday he told the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch he had not yet decided whether he should resign from
the clubs.
   ``I haven't made up my mind on whether that would be
necessary,'' he told the newspaper. ``I am going to Washington for
nine months to help the attorney general as his deputy.''
   Shepherd said he told Meese and other Justice Department
officials about his club memberships in conversations in Washington
earlier this week. He added that the FBI ``is aware of this.''
   In the same interview, Shepherd also said he was confident he
would be cleared by the FBI of allegations that he had an affair
with a former bookkeeper at his firm and that he had authorized her
to write $147,000 in checks to herself.
   He added that the allegations by Denise Sinner, 29, of St.
Peters, Mo., ``are absolutely untrue and unfounded.''
   Sinner was convicted last month in St. Louis Circuit Court on
charges of making false statements and stealing more than $100,000
from Shepherd's law firm, Shepherd, Sandberg & Phoenix.
   Sinner's attorney, Darrill S. Beebe, said Thursday he was
surprised when he heard that Meese had chosen Shepherd for a top
Justice Department post. However, he said he and Sinner would
testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Shepherd ``only
if we're subpoenaed. We're not volunteering.''
   Shepherd, a former president of the American Bar Association,
was tapped by Meese on Tuesday to fill the deputy attorney
general's job following the March 29 protest resignation of Arnold
Burns.
   Burns quit along with Assistant Attorney General William Weld
because of concerns that the 11-month criminal investigation of
Meese was dragging down the Justice Department, department sources
have said.
   Meese left Wednesday on a trip to Latin America to discuss
anti-drug efforts.
   Shepherd's memberships in the Missouri Athletic Club and the
Bellerive Country Club were first reported by NBC News. Jim Baer, a
spokesman for the athletic club in downtown St. Louis, confirmed
Thursday that Shepherd is a member and said the club, founded in
1904, does not accept women.
   Arthur Wright, president of the country club in suburban St.
Louis, said Shepherd has been a member there since 1970. ``There
are no black members,'' Wright said, ``but our bylaws specify that
the club is open to everybody.''
   Wright said, however, that membership in the country club is
through invitation only and ``to the best of my knowledge, no black
has ever been proposed for membership.''
   A spokeswoman for the American Bar Association, Gail Alexander,
said the group's code of conduct prohibits members who are judges
from belonging to private clubs that practice ``invidious
discrimination.''
   Ms. Alexander said the ABA also has a policy that prohibits
meetings from being held in such private clubs.
   The issue of membership in exclusionary clubs has arisen before,
with mixed results. President Carter's nominee for attorney
general, Griffin Bell, told the Judiciary Committee during his
confirmation hearings he would resign from such clubs. President
Reagan's first attorney general, William French Smith, refused to
follow that example and was confirmed anyway.
   More recently, U.S. Circuit Judge Anthony Kennedy resigned from
membership in two exclusionary clubs when his name was first
mentioned as a possible nominee for the Supreme Court. He was
subsequently confirmed as a justice.

<HEAD>Space Shuttle to be Equipped With Crew Escape Pole</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   NASA says the first space shuttle to fly since
the Challenger accident will be equipped with the equivalent of a
fireman's pole so astronauts can slide to safety if the craft has
to ditch in the ocean.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration chose the pole
escape method Thursday over an alternative that would have used
rockets to propel the crew away from the shuttle Discovery in an
emergency.
   By sliding down the pole, the astronauts would clear the
shuttle's tail before parachuting into the sea, NASA says.
   For all the strength that allows the shuttle to withstand the
buffeting that accompanies a climb or descent through the
atmosphere, the vehicle probably could not survive a crash landing
on the ocean.
   ``The telescoping pole was selected as it has shown to be safer,
simpler to operate, lighter weight and easier to support than the
tractor rocket system,'' said Arnold D. Aldrich, a top shuttle
program official.
   Barbara Selby, a NASA spokeswoman, said the 10{-foot pole
already is being installed in Discovery and will be ready for the
first flight, scheduled for Aug. 4.
   The aluminum and steel pole weighs 241 pounds, 70 pounds lighter
than the rocket system.
   Moreover, top NASA officials have said all along they were
uncomfortable with storing explosive rockets in the crew cabin.
   The Rogers Commission, which investigated the 1986 Challenger
accident, found that no escape method would have saved the seven
astronauts who died in that explosion. But, it said, ``The crew
should have a means of escaping the orbiter in controlled, gliding
flight.''
   The pole is intended for just such a purpose. If the shuttle had
to ditch _ either on an aborted launching or on return from space _
the pole would be extended out the side hatch and the crew would
attach themselves to it with rings on their parachutes and slide
down, one at a time.
   During launch and landing, the unextended pole will be pointed
toward the hatch. It will be stowed while the shuttle is in orbit.
   The Challenger astronauts died during ascent while the solid
rocket boosters were still firing and attached to the shuttle.
Engineers say the new escape system cannot be used while the
shuttle is connected to the rockets.
   ``This decision completes the crew escape system package,'' a
NASA statement said. ``The agency already has replaced the
spacecraft's hatch so it can be jettisoned with explosive bolts and
it is installing a partial pressure suit, oxygen equipment, a
parachute, a life raft and survival equipment for each crew
member.''
   Under the rocket system, the astronauts would have to jettison
the hatch, and, one-by-one, lie on a metal ramp that slanted out
the door. Each one would have to attach a line to a small rocket
housed in an adjacent rack and be pulled out.
   The pole system was tested in February and March, using a fixed
pole that extended through a hatch-like opening in a C-141 cargo
plane. Navy parachutists completed 66 jumps, using cords attached
to their parachute harnesses to slide down the pole and descend to
a safe landing.
   NASA said the side hatch jettison system can also be helpful if
an emergency should require a quick crew exit once the ship is on
the ground. The new hatch contains an escape slide similar to those
on commercial airliners.

<HEAD>Teamsters Trim Wage Increase To Improve Pension Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teamster truck drivers and warehouse workers
are giving up some of the wage increase their union has just
negotiated for them in exchange for more pension and other fringe
benefits.
   The new proposed National Master Freight Agreement unveiled
Thursday differs from the tentative pact signed last week by the
union and Trucking Management Inc., the industry's bargaining arm.
   Duke Zeller, a Teamster spokesman, acknowledged Thursday that
some key provisions in the proposed contract were re-negotiated
this week in response to pockets of opposition to them within the
union.
   ``There were always some i's to be dotted and t's to be
crossed,'' Zeller said. ``Obviously pension matters were of primary
concern and the negotiators responded to the dictates of what the
membership felt was important.''
   Zeller said the union plans to begin mailing out ballots next
week for a rank-and-file ratification vote, with ballot counting
and announcement of the results to occur in mid-May.
   Under the Teamsters' constitution, rejection of a negotiated
contract requires a two-thirds membership vote against it. About
200,000 workers are covered by the contract.
   When signed a week ago, the proposed three-year accord included
an immediate 50-cent hourly wage increase followed by 35-cent
raises in April 1989 and again in 1990.
   The 15-cent difference the first year is being switched to
contributions by employers to the union's pension and health and
welfare funds. The union's pension fund now provides retirees with
a monthly pension check of up to $1,500.
   Instead of a 20-cents-per-hour increase in contributions to the
two funds in each of the three years, trucking companies would now
kick in 35 cents more an hour this year.
   If ratified, the contract would raise the base wage rate for
truck drivers from the current $14.71 to $15.06 hour, retroactive
to April 1. Wages would rise to $15.41 an hour in April 1989 and to
$15.76 in 1990.
   So-called ``casual'' part-time workers now paid about $3 an hour
less than the top scale also will get the same hourly wage and
benefit increases under the renegotiated pact, Zeller said.
   Richard Belous, a labor market analyst for The Conference Board,
a business research house, said the renegotiated contract belies a
myth that, with lower tax rates, workers would opt for more pay
than benefits.
   ``Given the choice between cash and security, workers are
telling their negotiators to go back and get more security.''
Belous said. ``Once they reach a certain pay level, they want more
protection against the vagaries of ill health and old age.''
   The contract also recoups for Teamsters some of the concessions
the union yielded to the industry in 1985.
   A two-tier wage system in which new hires started out at 70
percent of the base scale and rose by 10 percent a year to 100
percent at the end of three years is diminished by half.
   Under the new accord, new hires will start at 85 percent of the
top scale, rising by 5 percentage points every six months until
they reach 100 percent after a year and one-half.
   Many within the union had complained the two-tier scales were
allowing the largest trucking companies who are adding new hires to
their payrolls to undercut freight rates of small companies with
older work forces.

   The nation's budget director and the
postmaster general disagree over whether the U.S. mail ought to be
turned over to private companies, and postal workers are siding
with their boss.
   Budget director James Miller said in a seminar Thursday that the
Postal Service should not have a monopoly on letter deliveries.
Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank indicated to the same group he
doesn't like the idea of so-called ``privatization.''
   As the two attended meetings sponsored by the conservative think
tank Cato Institute, union leader Moe Biller led 100 picketers
outside in a cold drizzle.
   ``Miller, Miller, he's a jerk; privatization just won't work,''
the group chanted.
   Biller, president of the American Postal Workers Union, called
Miller's proposal ``cockeyed'' and said it would cause chaos with
the mail and increase costs to the public. The APWU is the largest
of four mail unions, representing about 365,000 of the nation's
800,000 postal workers.
   Biller said that accusations that the postal monopoly is causing
increased costs are ``unmitigated lies.'' The CATO Institute, in a
report issued as postal rates went up Sunday, said mail service is
getting slower, more expensive and less reliable because of the
lack of competition.
   Wearing a sign accusing Miller of betraying postal reform,
Biller stood at the doorway of the seminar room for a few minutes
before the budget director arrived. As the doors were closed, he
told seminar organizers, ``You're afraid of a free society.''
   Biller later followed Miller into the hotel and shook his hand,
saying he wanted to debate him on the idea of turning over the
Postal Service to private business.
   Miller said in a speech: ``There is no good reason why it (the
Postal Service) should remain part of the U.S. government, and no
good reason why it should enjoy a monopoly over the delivery of
letter mail.''
   He accused the service of wanting to be a government-protected
monopoly when it comes to letter mail and a federal agency when it
comes to federal subsidies and other benefits.
   Miller denied allegations from the postal unions and others that
his Office of Management and Budget has tried to intrude into
management of the Postal Service, which is an independent
government agency.
   Frank, who took over the Postal Service March 1, suggested
privatization could be a code word for union-busting. He said he is
against eliminating the letter-mail monopoly the service has and
does not believe private companies should be allowed to skim off
profitable segments of the postal service.
   He said, however, he would support a genuine effort to promote
efficiency by sharing work with private mailers and contracting
more non-critical postal services.
   Frank said the Postal Service should be ``the most efficient,
reliable, convenient public service in the country.'' He noted that
private package services deliver only a tiny fraction of the 500
million items a day handled by the Postal Service.
   He said even advocates of privatization realize changes must be
gradual, adding, ``I sense a desire to go slowly, a recognition
that the mail system, like Humpty Dumpty, once broken, couldn't be
put back together again.''

<HEAD>Antarctic Icebergs Increasing With Warming Trend</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Earth's slowly rising temperature may be
to blame for the recent increase in icebergs breaking off from
Antarctica, government ice specialists say.
   They can't be sure yet, but officials of the Navy-NOAA Joint Ice
Center note that as the global temperature has increased, so have
the size and number of icebergs.
   ``An abnormally high amount of ice shelf calving is occurring in
Antarctica,'' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
meteorologist Glenn Rutledge said Thursday.
   Increases in the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the
atmosphere over the last century or so have been associated with
rising temperatures around the world.
   Some scientists believe that the temperature increase, amounting
to one or two degrees Fahrenheit in the last century, could lead to
major climate changes including melting the ice in the polar
regions.
   This could cause a rise in the ocean level around the world and
cause major changes in weather patterns, climatologists have warned.
   ``The poles are sensitive indicators of change'' in the Earth's
climate, Rutledge said.
   But while the increase in icebergs may be a result of the rising
temperature, there isn't yet enough information to be certain, said
Russell Koffler, who heads the satellite services at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``We have only 12 years of data,'' added Rutledge. ``That is
nothing in the geological bucket.''
   But he noted that both abnormally large icebergs and an
increasing number of bergs have been breaking loose in the last
year or two.
   Whether this will be a continuing trend he declined to forecast,
saying ``the Earth, as a system, is difficult to predict.''
   Rutledge said the iceberg increase was notable in the Antarctic
area. It's harder to determine if more bergs are arising in the
arctic, where they tend to be smaller and larger in number anyway,
he said.
   But in Antarctica two exceptional iceberge have broken loose in
the last two years.
   Last year a berg called B-9 broke off the Ross ice shelf.
Measuring 86 miles by 23 miles, B-9 covered 1,978 square miles,
nearly as big as Delaware.
   At 800 feet thick, it contains enough water to supply Los
Angeles for 700 years, said Rutledge. And loose in the ocean it
could be a serious hazard to shipping.
   B-9 has run aground on an underwater mountain, he said, but is
likely to break free eventually, and could take from two to seven
years to melt, he said.
   An even larger iceberg broke free from the other side of
Antarctica in 1986, Rutledge added, but that has since split into
pieces, leaving B-9 as the largest floating mass of ice.
   Other smaller bergs have broken free also, though numbers were
not available. Indeed, many bergs are too small to register on the
satellites used to watch them, which track items about a half-mile
across and larger.
   Navy Commander Donald Hinson, director of the Joint Ice Center,
said that within a few years improved satellites will be in place
to allow smaller bergs to be followed.
   The Center is responsible for monitoring ice conditions in the
Great Lakes and most of the oceans of the world. The lone exception
is the North Atlantic, where bergs are tracked by the International
Ice Patrol, a Coast Guard operation set up in 1912 following the
Titanic disaster. The two groups share data.

   It seems that elephants can get by with
whispering where most of us would have to shout.
   Katherine B. Payne, an elephant researcher in Etosha Park,
Namibia, says that elephants can be heard for as far away as three
miles when they ``talk.''
   But most of the time only other elephants can hear. Two-thirds
of the sounds they make are too low for humans, just as a dog
whistle makes sounds too high for the limited human ear, she says.
   ``If you get close enough to the elephant, though, you can feel
them,'' the Cornell University researcher said Thursday at a news
conference hosted by her sponsor, the World Wildlife Fund. ``It's
like thunder, sometimes, or being in church close to the lowest
pipe on the organ.''
   Pigeons and guinea fowl can hear such ``infra-sounds,'' an Asian
grouse called the capercaillie is known to make some, and fin
whales make quite a lot, but elephants seem to be the first land
animals found to have the talent.
   ``The existence of these calls may help explain how elephants
coordinate their society over long distances,'' Ms. Payne wrote in
a summary of her work.
   She knows about a dozen different sounds that elephants make,
such as the kind of greeting chorused by a group of females when a
male has found them.
   ``The males can tell one another things like `That's Caroline
and her group over there' or `There's big aggressive bull out that
way','' she said.
   ``It's a repertoire, not a language.''
   Other identifiable sounds include those between baby elephants
and mothers. She said there is some evidence that a mother and calf
can distinguish one another by sounds they make.
   Between the elephant's eyes, where there might be a nose if
there were no trunk, lies a thick fold of skin that she says can be
seen vibrating when the sound is made.
   In one experiment, the researchers played the pre-recorded call
of a female elephant in heat to a pair of males. The call was not
too easy to record because a given female elephant may be in heat
for only one day in four years.
   ``It goes like this,'' said Ms. Payne, peering earnestly through
her gold-rimmed glasses. ``Only of course I'm 10 octaves too high.''
   She made a soft, undulating sound _ ``whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo.''
There are usually a series of such sounds, each about seven seconds
long, she said.
   She showed a film of the episode, shot from a specially built
tower last August by a water hole in northern Namibia.
   Near the tower other members of the team manned concealed a
loudspeaker. Clocks were coordinated, down to fractions of a second.
   When two young male elephants appeared, the filming began. At a
moment that was not signalled to the photographer, the loudspeaker
began playing the female elephant sounds, inaudible to the humans
concerned.
   A moment afterwards the two males stopped their play. The film
shows them standing altogether still, something elephants rarely
do. Their huge ears fan out. They both turn and start moving
quickly in the direction of the loudspeaker.
   ``The boys at the loudspeaker were praying,'' said Ms. Payne.
``The males came close, but they went right by and kept on going in
the same direction. We don't know how far.''
   The two males would probably have fought if there actually had
been a female at the other end of the call, she said.

   The longneck beer may be the beverage of
choice for more Texans, but five wineries from the Lone Star State
are hoping to make a big splash at Italy's largest wine festival.
   The wineries hope exposure at the Vin Italy show in Verona will
increase their credibility with financial institutions that have
been slow to lend them money for expansion in a state better known
for its chili than its Chenin Blanc.
   ``I think it will enhance the prestige of Texas wines to have
competed at the premier wine festival in Europe,'' Rep. Kika de la
Garza, D-Texas, said before leaving for the show, which opened
today.
   ``Secondly, the marketing part of it will allow the wine brokers
and merchants to know we have good quality wines in Texas,'' de la
Garza said. As head of the House Agriculture Committee, de la Garza
helped arranged U.S. participation in the show.
   The Texas participants are hoping international exposure will
lay the groundwork for exports once financing through. Obtaining
such financing has been hard, industry and government officials
say, for a young industry in a state riddled with a record number
of bank failures.
   ``Wines from a new producing region are greeted with skepticism
and I think our wines are beyond that in terms of quality, and I
think that will be recognized in Italy,'' says John Lowey,
president of the participating Llano Estacado in Lubbock.
   ``We're making a statement about the quality of the wines we
produce here,'' said Jennifer Cox, a co-owner of the participating
Pheasant Ridge winery, also in Lubbock.
   Also sending wines are Messina-Hof Wine Cellars in Bryan, Fall
Creek winery in the Hill Country town of Tow, and the Bluebonnet
Hill Winery in Ballinger in West Texas.
   Texas had one winery in 1975 _ today it has 22. Five of those
wineries will join 30 others across the country from five other
states _ California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New Mexico and
Washington _ in the first official exhibition of American wines at
Vin Italy.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agriculture Service
is sponsoring the U.S. exhibit. It will be among 1,700 at the trade
show, where more than 80,000 people are expected _ including wine
critics, importers and distributors from 50 countries, according to
de la Garza's office.
   ``We are planting the seeds of a long-term harvest,'' de la
Garza said.
   ``My interest is that the wine show is looking down the road
several years,'' Lowey said Wednesday from Lubbock. ``We're
currently selling all of the wine we produce here in Texas _ 45,000
cases this year. We're very well supported here at home. So we
don't have a lot of wine to go to Europe with. I'd like to lay the
groundwork for developing a European market, and this is a good
vehicle to do that with.''
   Interest in American wines is growing and they are now a hot
export item, says Joe Dugan, a spokesman for the House Agriculture
Committee.
   Wine exports rose 64 percent in volume and 75 percent in value
in 1987 over 1986, Dugan said Wednesday, for a total value of $60.8
million last year.
   That's still a fraction of the U.S. wine market, which had sales
of $7.2 billion last year of imports and domestic wines. Industry
figures indicate wine imports totaled $1 billion in 1987, Dugan
said.
   But the depreciating dollar makes American wines a better buy in
Europe and Pacific Basin countries like Japan and Taiwan, where an
upscale segment of the population has plenty of disposable income
to afford fine wines and enjoys experimenting with new products, he
said.
   American exporters hope to appeal to that part of the market and
aren't attempting to compete with the less expensive Italian wines,
Dugan said.
   ``Texas wines, and those from New Mexico, New York and other
states have an opportunity to find a market niche. ... There's a
certain cache in having an unusual American wine,'' Dugan said.

   In a simpler time, when the United States was
better able to throw its weight around, it took little more than a
snap of a finger in Washington to bring down a Central American
strongman who ran afoul of American interests.
   But those days are long gone, as the Reagan administration is
finding in its efforts to depose Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega.
The general's resilience in the face of relentless American
pressure has caused surprise and anguish and even a degree of
grudging admiration here.
   As yet, there is still no happy ending to the crisis in sight _
and as a result, the Reagan administration has been getting it from
all sides.
   Some criticize it for cooperating with Noriega for so long
despite suspicions of his involvement in drug trafficking.
   Others say it has not gone far enough since breaking with him to
force his ouster, while still others maintain that administration
policies are misguided because they have harmed the Panamanian
people more than Noriega.
   Among other measures, the administration has blocked Panamanian
access to $50 million in official Panamanian funds on deposit in
American banks and suspended payments for canal-related services.
   This has contributed to a financial collapse in Panama that, in
turn, has led to widespread deprivation. Noriega has sought to
portray the crisis as the product of American interventionism while
the United States insists that Noriega himself is responsible
through actions that have led to deep alienation among Panamanians.
   The administration's latest tactic is to try to create
dissension in the Panamanian Defense Forces, which Noriega heads.
The administration believes that the more the defense forces think
the United States may resort to military intervention, the more
likely they will be to turn against Noriega and force him into
exile.
   This explains why the administration has refused to foreclose,
publicly at least, the option of military intervention. It also was
probably a contributing factor to the administration's decision to
send 2,100 military forces to Panama over the past week.
   The administration insists that the troops are being sent to
protect American citizens and interests in Panama and for routine
training exercises. The troop deployment has nothing to do with
Noriega, the Pentagon insists.
   Still, U.S. officials would not be unhappy if the arrival of all
these American soldiers generates nervousness within the Panamanian
military.
   ``There are only a few thousand members of the PDF who are
supposedly battle-trained,'' said one official, insisting on
anonymity. ``They are not eager to take on the American military.
They might conclude that their best hope of avoiding that
possibility is to get rid of Noriega.''
   Noriega's staying power contrasts with the way things used to be
in the Caribbean. In 1903, when Panama was a part of Colombia, the
combination of a few hired hands sent to stir up trouble in Panama
City and the deployment of American naval forces offshore led to
Panama's secession from Colombia. Almost without effort, a new
nation was created.
   The United States promptly recognized the fledgling state and,
within two weeks, Panama signed a treaty giving the United States
the perpetual right to a canal zone and the authority to build a
transoceanic waterway.
   It was easier to get things done in those days but the United
States is now paying for the heavy-handedness of that era. As
evidence, no Latin American country has voiced support for current
administration policy toward Panama because each is worried it may
some day be a U.S. target if it does something to displease
Washington.
   Six weeks after the crisis erupted, no quick solution is
apparent. The Reagan administration could increase the pressure on
Noriega by imposing a total trade embargo against Panama but many
officials fear that, as before, the primary victims of such a
strategy would be Panamanians and not Noriega.
   Beyond that, trade embargoes seldom achieve the desired
objective. A 3-year-old trade ban against Nicaragua has not
loosened the Sandinista grip on power there.
   And it was 28 years ago that the United States imposed a trade
embargo against Cuban President Fidel Castro, who next January will
celebrate his 30th anniversary in power.

Candidate</HEAD>

   When the presidential campaigns of Paul Simon,
Pat Robertson and Richard Gephardt faltered, the Secret Service got
a break _ to the tune of $45,000 a day.
   That's how much it cost to provide the three candidates with
Secret Service protection, according to administration officials
and government documents.
   At one point in the 1988 presidential campaign, five candidates
were under Secret Service protection, not counting Vice President
George Bush who gets it anyway by virtue of his office. The cost:
$15,000 a day, $105,000 a week for each candidate; $75,000 a day,
$525,000 a week for all five.
   Now there are only two _ Democrats Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore
Jr. Michael Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, passed up
Secret Service protection because, according to his wife Kitty,
``it would be just one additional layer from the people.''
   However, as expensive as $75,000 a day might sound, it pales
against the $4.9 million it cost to guard Pope John Paul II during
his 11-day visit to the United States last year.
   Secret Service Director John R. Simpson and Francis A. Keating,
assistant Treasury secretary for enforcement, told Congress
recently that the pope's visit to the United States was ``the
single most dal 1989.
   Candidate protection is determined by a five-member panel
consisting of a Supreme Court justice, the Senate majority and
minority leaders and the House speaker and minority leader, who
meet and make recommendations to the Treasury secretary. Among the
things taken into consideration: the number of delegates a
candidate receives and whether any death threats have been made
against the candidate.
   If the secretary accepts the panel's recommendations, the
candidate is notified. To decline protection, a candidate must
inform the secretary in writing.
   Simon gave up his Secret Service protection Wednesday, the day
before he announced he was suspending all campaign activities.
Gephardt quit the race March 28, surrendering his protection a day
earlier.
   Robertson's protection ended Wednesday. He has all but abandoned
campaign activity.
   Keating said the advisory panel did not recommend protection for
erstwhile candidates Bruce Babbitt, Alexander M. Haig Jr. or former
Gov. Pete DuPont of Delaware.
   Along with Dukakis, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas also declined
protection during his unsuccessful run for the presidency.
   Walt Riker, Dole's press secretary, said Dole believes that
Secret Service protection is too expensive and ``limits where you
can go and what you can do. He likes to go out, meet the people and
shake their hands.''
   The converse applies, too.
   On his first day without Secret Service agents nearby, Simon was
quick to exercise his new freedom.
   He jumped into his Chevy Caprice, drove to a mall and bought two
new sport shirts for a week-long family vacation in Puerto Rico.

   As top cop for the Academy Awards, Jerry
Moon's job is to conjure up nightmarish scenarios and make sure he
can respond to any calamity that might disrupt Hollywood's biggest
night.
   ``Woe be unto anyone who tries to disrupt the show,'' Moon said.
   Intruders simply won't get past Moon's security phalanx at
Monday night's 60th annual Oscar ceremony, which has moved to the
refurbished Shrine Auditorium five miles south of downtown.
   Moon, 60 _ a former professional wrestler, ex-policeman and
retired security chief for Disney Studios _ has been Oscar's
bodyguard for 17 years, and he's ready for just about anything.
   ``By Monday, you just sit back and wring your hands and hope you
thought of everything,'' he said.
   In addition 6,000 of the well-heeled and glamorous, the Academy
Awards attracts a worldwide audience of millions, a curbside throng
of squealing fans and sometimes a seamy contingent of malcontents,
derelicts and fanatics.
   In the past, there have been bomb threats, political
demonstrations, imposters, publicity-seekers and star-struck fans
with elaborate schemes to get inside. There has never been a
serious offense, however.
   ``We talk to young people and find out what the latest fad is,''
Moon said, when asked about anticipating untoward acts. ``There was
the pie in the face fad, the streaker fad, you name it and there is
usually a new fad.''
   But discussions with students this year haven't given him any
clues.
   ``Apparently the younger people are more intent on their
studies,'' he said. ``We can't find any one thing that is really in
the mind of the kids. We have to think of everything as being a
possibility and use our imaginations.''
   Many have tired to pass illicitly through entrances in the past,
but only a few have succeeded. There was Robert Opel, the infamous
on-camera streaker of 1974.
   Opel, since deceased, was able to obtain credentials that
permitted him backstage. Moon said that security hole has been
plugged. ``I have yet to convince myself there wasn't some
collusion there,'' he said.
   There was once an imposter in a California Highway Patrol
uniform who looked like actor Erik Estrada. And a camper was once
flushed out of a Music Center men's room stall the day before the
awards show.
   Demonstrators come almost yearly to the Academy Awards, drawn by
the presence of the world's news media or irked by the nomination
of a certain movie or star, such as Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave
and Charlie Chaplin.
   Demonstrators clashed with police in 1979 when ``The Deer
Hunter'' won best picture and angry Vietnam veterans surged across
the street fronting the Music Center.
   Moon began planning Oscar security in January. He set up shop at
the Shrine two weeks before showtime, a week earlier that usual
because of the move from the Music Center. His job finishes when
the last guest slips away from the post-Oscar Board of Governor's
Ball.
   More than 300 officers, under the direction of Moon, will be on
hand Monday night, and he is guaranteeing the safety of Academy
guests into and out of the area near the University of Southern
California campus.
   Once they arrive, they won't have to leave, for the renovated
Shrine, with new bathrooms, paint, red carpets and air
conditioning, will be the site the Governor's Ball, instead of the
Beverly Hilton Hotel crosstown.
   ``It will be a wonderful night,'' Moon said.

   Here is the text of the ``A Piece of My Mind''
column entitled ``It's Over, Debbie'' from the Jan. 8, 1988 edition
of the Journal of the American Medical Association:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The call came in the middle of the night. As a gynecology
resident rotating through a large, private hospital, I had come to
detest telephone calls, because invariably I would be up for
several hours and would not feel good the next day. However, duty
called, so I answered the phone. A nurse informed me that a patient
was having difficulty getting rest, could I please see her. She was
on 3 North. That was the gynecologic oncology unit, not my usual
duty station. As I trudged along, bumping sleepily against walls
and corners and not believing I was up again, I tried to imagine
what I might find at the end of my walk. Maybe an elderly woman
with an anxiety reaction, or perhaps something particularly
horrible.
   I grabbed the chart from the nurses station on my way to the
patient's room, and the nurse gave me some hurried details: a
20-year-old girl named Debbie was dying of ovarian cancer. She was
having unrelenting vomiting apparently as the result of an alcohol
drip administered for sedation. Hmmm, I thought. Very sad. As I
approached the room I could hear loud, labored breathing. I entered
and saw an emaciated, dark-haired woman who appeared much older
than 20. She was receiving nasal oxygen, had an IV, and was sitting
in bed suffering from what was obviously severe air hunger. The
chart noted her weight at 80 pounds. A second woman, also
dark-haired but of middle age, stood at her right, holding her
hand. Both looked up as I entered. The room seemed filled with the
patient's desperate effort to survive. Her eyes were hollow, and
she had suprasternal and intercostal retractions with her rapid
inspirations. She had not eaten or slept in two days. She had not
responded to chemotherapy and was being given supportive care only.
It was a gallows scene, a cruel mockery of her youth and
unfulfilled potential. Her only words to me were, ``Let's get this
over with.''
   I retreated with my thoughts to the nurses station. The patient
was tired and needed rest. I could not give her health, but I could
give her rest. I asked the nurse to draw 20 mg of morphine sulfate
into a syringe. Enough, I thought, to do the job. I took the
syringe into the room and told the two women I was going to give
Debbie something that would let her rest and to say good-bye.
Debbie looked at the syringe, then laid her head on the pillow with
her eyes open, watching what was left of the world. I injected the
morphine intravenously and watched to see if my calculations on its
effects would be correct. Within seconds her breathing slowed to a
normal rate, her eyes closed, and her features softened as she
seemed restful at last. The older woman stroked the hair of the
now-sleeping patient. I waited for the inevitable next effect of
depressing the respiratory drive. With clocklike certainty, within
four minutes the breathing rate slowed even more, then became
irregular, then ceased. The dark-haired woman stood erect and
seemed relieved.
   It's over, Debbie.
   
   Name Withheld by Request.

<HEAD>FDA Effectively Bars Home AIDS Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has told
prospective developers of home AIDS test kits they must limit
market research to hospitals, clinics and other traditional health
care settings.
   That and other restrictions contained in a March 30 policy
statement effectively bar home test kits by heading off
accumulation of the very kind of data that would be needed to
convince the FDA to approve them.
   Despite the clear signal that the FDA is not disposed to look
kindly on such mass distribution of an AIDS test, the policy letter
said the agency will seek public comment that could lead it to
revise the guidelines.
   FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said Thursday the FDA will publish
its guidelines for considering approval of home AIDS test kits in
the Federal Register, along with its intention to convene public
workshops on the issues surrounding such premarket research.
   The policy letter went to 17 people or companies who had
expressed interest in marketing an AIDS test kit. Those parties,
none identified by the agency, had been told earlier that FDA
permission would have to be granted before they could be sold.
   FDA officials have long expressed skepticism about any home AIDS
test kit winning approval, because the disease is fatal and U.S.
Public Health Service guidelines say any testing should be
accompanied by appropriate counseling.
   The FDA is a part of the Public Health Service.
   An official who insisted on anonymity for fear of being accused
of prejudging applications before they are filed said the existence
of home tests for pregnancy is no argument for the home AIDS tests.
The official said the emotional impact of learning one has a
life-threatening disease is far different.
   The policy letter, signed by Paul D. Parkman, director of the
FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, tells companies
not to even bother filing applications for premarket approval
unless:
   _Their kits are labeled and marketed for professional use only
``within a comprehensive health care environment (e.g. hospitals,
medical clinics, doctor's offices, STD clinics, alternative test
sites and mental health clinics.)''
   _Blood is drawn only by a person ``recognized by a state or
local authority to perform such procedures'' _ in other words a
licensed technician.
   _The testing sequence includes a currently licensed screening
test.
   _All results are reported directly to professional health care
providers for reporting and interpretation of results ``as well as
for counseling of the individual.''

   It remains to be seen if struggling author Alan
Rosenberg ever will get his books published, but he's already
auctioned off his manuscripts and other memorabilia.
   He raised $965, much less than the $15,000 he spent staging to
stage it Thursday in the penthouse of the New York Hilton, a huge
publicity stunt that surpassed even his own expectations.
   ``I'm thrilled people even thought this was worth something,''
he said. ``We did good.''
   Rosenberg watched as an old Boston Herald baseball cap sold for
$50, a dogeared dictionary for $40 and a manuscript of an
unpublished book he wrote about the second Claus von Bulow trial
fetched for $270.
   The money was of little importance. It was television news
crews, magazine writers, newspaper reporters and other journalists
that he hoped to snare.
   And snared they were as they came to his show, which included
door prizes and an auctioneer who has sold memorabilia of Ernest
Hemingway, Richard Nixon and Babe Ruth.
   Rosenberg failed to find a publisher for his first two books so
he planned the publicity stunt after finishing his latest novel,
``Run Red Riding Hood Run,'' a book that he said mixes murder,
suspense and comedy.
   As was the case with his books on the second Claus von Bulow
trial and his experiences at the Boston Herald, there's no
publisher.
   As part of the hoopla, Rosenberg started the day by marrying
Cathy Lee Counts at City Hall.
   He also attempted to lure several better-known (make that known)
authors such as Stephen King and John Irving. Both said no, but
sent messages, Irving's in the form of a ``rejection post card.
   Armed with the published evidence of his hype, the 34-year-old
Maine author plans to go to a booksellers convention in Anaheim,
Calif., to peddle his product.
   ``This book has never been rejected,'' he said of his latest
work after selling his collection of 30 rejection notices from
publishers for his other books at the auction for $65.
   About 50 people attended the auction, mostly family, friends,
reporters and the 10 models Rosenberg hired to read his work to the
group.
   Several serious bidders also showed up, including Herb
Goldsmith, president of Members Only, the clothing manufacturer.
   ``This is as contemporary as art can get,'' he said, explaining
his interest in the works of a writer whose books have never been
published.
   He bought a first draft of Rosenberg's new book for $45 at the
auction, which, like most items, began with a bid of $2.75.
``Anything that starts at $2.75, I'll bid,'' he said. ``This is
unique.''
   Joyce Burger of Manhattan said she bought a 431-page manuscript
of Rosenberg's new unpublished novel for $270 for a friend who
became interested after reading about the auction in an
advertisement.
   She said her friend was betting on Rosenberg's future and hoped
the manuscript would grow in value.
   ``I think it's the bargain of the century because I am going to
be famous,'' Rosenberg said.

   A Libyan defector who says he worked as a
decoder for Libya's foreign ministry accuses Col. Moammar Gadhafi
of trying to assassinate the presidents of France and Egypt.
   Libyan authorities say the defector is a low-level diplomat
wanted on morals charges who was recruited by the CIA to discredit
Gadhafi.
   At a news conference Thursday organized by Gadhafi's main
opposition movement, The National Front for the Salvation of Libya,
Salem A. Saity said he defected from his post at the Libyan mission
to the United Nations after being recalled ``for consultations.''
   Saity, 29, said he realized then that his cover as an activist
in the opposition movement had been blown, especially when he
noticed he was being followed and his phone was tapped.
   He declined to say whether he would seek political asylum here,
adding that the movement would take the necessary precautions
against possible threats from Libyan agents.
   Mahmoud Azzabi, the spokesman for Libya's nine-member U.N.
mission in New York, said Saity disappeared at the end of January
after being given an airline ticket and told to return home to face
morals charges. He said he did not know what the specific charges
were against Saity.
   ``Two things were on his mind all the time _ booze and women,''
Azzabi said. ``That was all he talked about.''
   ``This is an all-out effort of the U.S. administration to
discredit'' the political liberalization Gadhafi introduced last
month, Azzabi added.
   ``He wasn't very important and he was not wanted for political
reasons, so we didn't pay attention or send letters to the United
Nations'' when he disappeared, he added. Azzabi denied that Saity
worked with classified material.
   Saity, who spoke in Arabic through an interpreter, said he had
been on the staff of the foreign minister in Libya, working as a
decoder in the classified section of the ministry as well as at the
U.N. mission. In the course of his work, Saity said, he saw
communications from Tripoli to Libyan missions abroad.
   One such communication relayed through the ministry in 1984 was
from Abdallah Sinousi, the head of military intelligence, ordering
the Libyan embassy in Tanzania to kill visiting Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Saity said.
   Sinousi also sent an order to the embassy in Burundi to
assassinate Mubarak and French President Francois Mitterand at a
francophone countries summit in 1985, Saity said.
   Gadhafi sent a man by the name of Mohammed Zabeida to the U.N.
mission to carry out attacks against his opponents living in the
United States, Saity said. He said U.S. authorities had gotten wise
to Zabeida and he had fled back to Libya in 1986.
   The Libyan mission spokesman said he had never heard of the
incident.
   ``His rule is synonymous with endless hostile interventions
around the globe,'' Saity said of Gadhafi. ``He has ransacked
Libya's wealth ... to fulfill his evil schemes.''
   Saity denied being recruited by U.S. authorities, but did not
rule out contacting them in the future. ``It's too soon to tell''
about his plans, he said.
   The State Department said it had no knowledge of Saity or his
activities.
   Saity said he was certain his parents in Libya would be
persecuted because of his defection but he felt compelled to
denounce Gadhafi, who ``has reduced Libya to a refuge of crime,
bankruptcy and corruption.''

<HEAD>Report Says Housing Agencies Do Little About Radon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While federal environmental officials say
radon gas causes up to 20,000 cancer deaths a year, federal housing
agencies see little responsibility to respond, the General
Accounting Office says in a new report.
   The report to Congress, made public Thursday, concludes that
agencies in the housing business _ hamstrung in part by a lack of
congressional guidance _ do little or nothing about the threat from
deadly radon.
   The report scrutinizes the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, the Veterans Administration, the Farmers Home Mortgage
Administration and the National Park Service.
   Radon is a naturally occurring, odorless and colorless gas. The
Environmental Protection Agency says radon may cause from 5,000 to
20,000 lung-cancer deaths annually.

   A government study of the nation's public
housing found that repair and renovation of existing units among
the 1.3 million dwellings nationwide would cost between $7.5
billion and $9.2 billion.
   The report, released today by the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, was based on inspection of 2,196 units and 3,120
buildings at public housing projects across the country at the end
of 1985. It took more than two years and $5 million to compile and
review the final report which was ordered by Congress, HUD
officials said.
   So far, said HUD deputy assistant secretary C. Duncan MacRae,
$3.9 billion has been spent.
   ``HUD is committed to restoring the public housing stock to
decent, safe and sanitary conditions in every instance where that
housing is viable,'' said HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce.

   The National Committee for Prevention of Child

from child abuse gave the wrong number of such deaths for Missouri.
   The report said there were seven child abuse fatalities in
Missouri in 1986 and 20 in 1987, but actually there were 19 in each

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Marcos McGrath called off
his attempt to mediate between Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and the
opposition, which has refused to negotiate unless the general first
agrees to leave the country.
   Also Thursday, there was a split in the main anti-Noriega
coalition. And police using tear gas and rubber hoses dispersed
hundreds of anti-government demonstrators in the western city of
David.
   A Roman Catholic church communique said mediation efforts were
suspended because the opposition had insisted Noriega _ the
nation's de facto ruler _ agree to depart and the general had
failed to agree in writing to mediation.
   ``The church in no way surrenders the difficult task of
mediation. It still considers it urgent and every day more so,''
said the communique, which asked all parties to remove obstacles so
that talks might begin.
   The opposition National Civic Crusade, which has led the
Panamanian fight to oust Noriega, said in a statement issued after
the church announcement that it stood by its negotiating conditions.
   A sign from Noriega that he was willing to step down remained an
``indispensable and essential condition'' for opening talks, it
said.
   In a communique that was not signed by Noriega, the government
had agreed to church mediation without preconditions.
   Earlier Thursday, two leaders of the opposition Popular Action
Party announced they were breaking with the 10-month-old Civic
Crusade to form the Popular Civic Movement. It was the first major
split in the opposition.
   Roberto Arosemena and Mauro Zuniga told a news conference the
new group had the support of the Authentic Panamanian Party, the
country's largest opposition party. Zuniga said the splinter group
also wants Noriega out, but thinks it is a job for Panamanians, not
Americans.
   The Civic Crusade's campaign to oust Noriega, chief of Panama's
15,000-strong Defense Forces, has been backed by Washington.
   The new opposition group opposes church mediation and does not
recognize Eric Arturo Delvalle, deposed by pro-Noriega lawmakers on
Feb. 26, as Panama's president. Government prosecutor Alvaro
Visuetti disclosed Wednesday that an arrest warrant had been issued
for Delvalle, who is in hiding in Panama.
   Delvalle, in a videotape released to Cable News Network
Thursday, said he would continue to fight to oust Noriega, who he
tried to fire the day before he himself was removed.
   ``Fellow countrymen, we cannot allow a gang of inhuman drug
traffickers to be the owners of our public institutions and of the
country itself,'' he said.
   The tape was reported made Thursday.
   In February, Noriega was indicted in Florida on federal drug
trafficking charges. The United States has frozen Panamanian
deposits in American banks, and Panama's banks closed during the
first week of March.
   Civilian sources contacted by telephone in David said Civic
Crusade members were beaten and arrested when police broke up a
protest march Thursday evening.
   Carlos Secchi, a Crusade member, said police used tear gas and
rubber hoses to break up the march by more than 500 demonstrators.
He said about 15 marchers were arrested. There were no immediate
reports of injuries.
   With the arrival this week of 1,300 extra U.S. troops this week,
there now are about 11,800 American soldiers in Panama to protect
the Panama Canal and guard American installations.
   Another 800 U.S. Marines were to arrive today for jungle
training that had been scheduled months ago. The Marines are slated
to stay for three weeks.
   Banking officials put an end Thursday to government speculation
the country's banks might open today or next week. Sources speaking
on condition of anonymity said they feared the government would
attempt to bleed deposits for its own use if the banks were to open.
   Lacking hard cash, the government has failed to meet its payroll
for a month. People paid by check cannot cash them. Panamanians
with dollars are using them sparingly, and many now depend on
charity for food.

<HEAD>Shultz Ends Middle East Tour, But Plans Another Peace Trip To
Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With PM-Shultz

<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz wound
up a five-day quest for Middle East peace talks today,
acknowledging progress could be measured only in inches.
   But Shultz said he expects to return to the region _ he did not
say when _ to ``to struggle against the odds.''
   He said his goal remains a comprehensive settlement between
Israel and its Arab neighbors and self-rule but not statehood for
the Palestinians.
   ``I think the stakes are very high and the opportunities very
great, even if the probabilities are against you,'' the secretary
told a news conference.
   He praised King Hussein of Jordan for ``having engaged seriously
with us for peace in the region.'' Earlier in the week, he called
the king ``a partner for peace.''
   Shultz did not offer an assessment of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir of Israel, whose position toward a Middle East peace
conference was an obstacle Shultz could not overcome.
   The secretary had hoped to convene a peace conference by
mid-April to launch talks between Israel and a mixed delegation of
Jordanians and Palestinians.
   ``I don't think we are going to make it and that's obvious,''
Shultz said.
   But he bristled when one of the reporters at a news conference
suggested his mission was doomed to failure.
   ``You have to be willing to do it,'' Shultz said. ``What am I
saving myself for anyway? I have a few more months to go here and I
want to try to leave something constructive for the region and for
my successors, and so I'm going to put my back into it. Why not?''
   The Reagan administration has a little more than nine months
left. The current trip is the third by Shultz to the Middle East
since October to try to break a 40-year impasse between Israel and
its Arab neighbors.
   Since early December, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip have been rioting against their Israeli occupiers. At least
141 Arabs and an Israeli soldier have been killed in the wave of
violence.
   Shamir objects to the U.S. proposal for a peace conference
because he finds in it opportunities for the Soviet Union to side
with the Arabs, as it usually does, and try to impose an
unfavorable settlement on Israel. Shultz gave assurances the United
States would stand by Israel and not let that happen, but Shamir
held to his position.
   Shultz said he expected to return ``at some point in the
future'' because it takes a special U.S. effort to bring the two
sides together.
   ``You measure headway in inches, not miles,'' he said.
   The secretary said he was leaving special U.S. envoy Wat
Cluverius in the region to continue talks.

<HEAD>Banks Criticize Lender Governments On Third World Debt</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 9, 11, 14 to CORRECT spelling of Schulmann.</NOTE>

   A spokesman for the international banking
community said today that creditor governments, not banks, have
done too little to help Third World countries with their debts.
   The Third World governments want either grants, more new loans
or relief from the burden of paying many billions on old ones every
year, said Horst Schulmann, a West German who heads the
Washington-based Institute of International Finance.
   ``Creditor governments have not done enough in bilateral
relations to provide more official financing, to open their
economies, or to improve the regulatory and tax regimes for private
lenders and investors,'' said Schulmann.
   Schulmann's comments were in a letter to leaders of the
International Monetary Fund and the Development Committee, a joint
group of the fund and its sister organization, the World Bank.
   The fund and bank are owned by 151 countries. Many of those
governments' top economic officials, including Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III, are expected to attend the two institutions'
joint semiannual meetings here next week.
   Baker and other government leaders have criticized commercial
banks for their slowdown of lending in recent years and have
recently been encouraging a ``menu'' of possible actions by the
banks. Many of these actions would require the banks to get rid of
loans at less than their face value.
   Barber Conable, president of the World Bank, has quietly
suggested that banks might also waive some of the billions of
dollars of interest they collect every year.
   ``We have repeatedly noted the dramatic decline in commercial
bank lending to developing countries and stressed the necessity for
signficantly increased flows from the private banks as an essential
ingredient of the debt strategy,'' he said in a report to be
delivered to the Development Committee April 15.
   Schulmann said many debtor governments have refused to seek the
fund's help because it insists on such ``adjustment'' conditions as
cutting government subsidies and devaluing currencies that lower
their people's living standards.
   Fund officials argue that Third World countries will be worse
off if their govnernments do not ask its help.
   Schulmann said the World Bank had been only partly successful in
getting debtor countries to make similar changes in their policies
and that its lending has grown less than expected.
   ``There is a need for the World Bank to be more innovative in
its approach to the debt problem,'' he said.
   He suggested that it should do more in the way of ``credit
enhancements'' _ the kind of financing that lessens risk for banks.
   Schulmann came out for an issue of ``special drawing rights,''
the fund's own kind of money, to member governments. This measure
has long been urged by Third World governments but opposed by the
United States on grounds that it would encourage inflation.
   Third-World debt is expected to reach $1.245 trillion at the end
of this year.

<HEAD>Attempted Anti-Noriega Coup Failed Ignominiously, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attempted coup attempt last month against
Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega failed ignominiously
when an officer loyal to Noriega locked the plotters inside an
arsenal, a newspaper reported today.
   Citing unidentified senior administration officials, the Chicago
Tribune reported in today's editions that the failure of the
allegedly U.S.-backed coup has left the Reagan administration's
anti-Noriega plans in chaos.
   The newspaper said several anti-Noriega members of the
15,000-member Panama Defense Forces went to the Central American
nation's main arsenal in Panama City last month to obtain guns for
the attempt, pretending to be on official military business.
   The guard commander at the arsenal, however, locked the plotters
inside and reported to his superiors that he thought a coup was in
progress, the newspaper reported.
   Swift action by Noriega's supporters put down the conspiracy and
resulted in the purge or arrest of nearly three dozen anti-Noriega
officers during the last several weeks, the Tribune reported.
   The newspaper quoted a source identified only as a well-placed
military expert as saying the abortive coup demonstrates ``the
depth to which the administration planners have underestimated
Noriega and misunderstood the situation there.''

<HEAD>Economist Supports Dukakis, Likes Jackson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economist John Kenneth Galbraith says he
admires Jesse Jackson but supports Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis for the Democratic nomination for president.
   ``I think Jesse Jackson has certainly been a good force in our
time. He has given voice to people who previously did not have
voice and is bringing a whole new group of people into the
political process. I think we're going to look back on Jesse
Jackson's campaign with great approval,'' Galbraith said at a news
conference at Miami University on Thursday.
   Asked if he thought Jackson could be elected president,
Galbraith said, ``My dear fellow, Ronald Reagan is president.''
   Galbraith said that if Reagan can be president, ``surely Jackson
can be president.''
   Galbraith attacked the economic policies of Reagan and his
predecessors because of the large deficits and high interest rates
resulting from those practices.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Detroit Mayor Coleman Young, who backed Michael
Dukakis in the Michigan Democratic presidential caucuses, is
offering to contribute money to the campaign of Jesse Jackson.
   Young wouldn't specify Thursday how much he would give, but Joel
Ferguson, who headed Jackson's efforts in Michigan, said the mayor
offered between $10,000 and $20,000 to Jackson's campaign.
   ``He called it a modest contribution. I called it substantial.
It's a statement that Jesse appreciates,'' Ferguson said after a
two-hour meeting with Young.
   Young said he was willing to contribute because Jackson's
campaign has unified black and white voters and raised such issues
as economic and racial justice.
   Young has assigned staff members to work for Jackson and Dukakis.
   Jackson beat Dukakis 2-1 in the Michigan caucuses March 26.

   The state Democratic Party is continuing to tally
results from Colorado's Monday night caucuses, with the share of
uncommitted delegates selected to county conventions on the
increase.
   With 95 percent of the state's 2,784 precincts reporting as of
Thursday, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, declared the winner
on Tuesday, was ahead of Jesse Jackson 43.1 percent to 35.1
percent, the state party figures showed. Uncommitted delegates
comprised 18.7 percent of the total number, a figure that has grown
steadily as reports from rural precincts trickle in.
   According to the Democrats, Dukakis has garnered the support of
5,189 delegates to Jackson's 4,228.5.
   A total of 2,255.5 county convention delegates are uncommitted;
313.5, or 2.6 percent are committed to Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore;
34.5, or 0.3 percent, are backers of Illinois Sen. Paul Simon; and
13.5, or 0.1 percent, are committed to other candidates, the state
Democratic Party figures showed.
   Vice President George Bush received 76 percent of the votes cast
in straw polls taken at Republican precinct caucuses. The straw
polls were not binding.

   Lawmakers punched and pushed each other
today in a wild melee in Parliament during a debate over whether to
return the government's budget proposal to the Cabinet for more
work.
   The fighting in the legislature, or Yuan, began when Chu
Kao-cheng of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party jumped on
the podium and grabbed the microphone from the Yuan's vice
president to stop him from calling for a vote on the budget.
   Jaw Shau-kong of the ruling Nationalist Party then grabbed Chu
by the hand and pulled him from the podium. The two rolled down a
stairway leading from the podium to the main floor as they scuffled.
   Chu later told reporters that about 10 Nationalist Party
legislators kicked and punched him after he fell to the floor.
Chu's face was bruised and his glasses were broken.
   After the three-minute melee, the vice president called for a
vote and the lawmakers overwhelming moved to debate the budget
proposal at a later session.
   Chu said earlier in the session that the Cabinet, which
submitted the proposal last month, should propose a new budget for
the fiscal year beginning July 1 by drastically cutting defense and
other expenditures.
   About a third of the proposed budget of 568 billion Taiwan
dollars ($19.8 billion) would go to defense, the government says.
But Chu and several other opposition legislators claim money
earmarked for scientific, education and other purposes also would
be used for defense.

   Stock prices eased slightly but stayed above their
record level in Tokyo Friday, while the U.S. dollar also fell.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 258.05-point winner Thursday, shed a modest
20.33 points, or 0.07 percent, closing the week at 26,748.89.
   The Nikkei average had closed Thursday at 26,769.22, topping its
previous record close of 26,646.43, which it reached on Oct. 14,
just before the world-wide stock market crash.
   The dollar finished the week at 125.18 yen, down 0.52 yen from
Thursday's finish of 125.70. It opened the day at 125.52 yen and
ranged between 125.05 and 125.78 yen.
   Currency trading was quiet and in a narrow range ahead of next
week's meeting in Washington of monetary authorities from seven
major industrialized nations, said Taeko Koyabashi of the Bank of
Tokyo.
   She added that speculation over U.S. trade figures due to be
released Thursday in Washington had yet to influence the Tokyo
market.

   The national legislature today elected China's
most powerful general, Yang Shangkun, president in one-candidate
balloting that was open for the first time to foreign reporters.
   Yang's election puts a close ally of senior leader Deng Xiaoping
and staunch supporter of Deng's economic reforms in the largely
ceremonial but highly visible post.
   The 84-year-old Deng remains chairman of the Central Military
Commission, his only government post. Like Yang, Deng was the only
choice for the post in voting among 2,883 delegates of the National
People's Congress.
   The legislature also elected Wan Li, who had been vice premier,
to head the congress' standing commitee, which is responsible for
legislative matters in between the full congress' once-a-year
sessions.
   The National People's Congress, which has been meeting since
March 25, is scheduled to elect the premier on Saturday and vice
premiers on Tuesday.
   Li Peng has been acting premier since November and is expected
to be confirmed in that post.
   Foreign reporters watched from a balcony in the Great Hall of
the People as the congress delegates, minus 87 who were said to
``have other business,'' marked large orange, red and yellow
ballots and dropped them in boxes.
   It was the first time foreign reporters were allowed to watch
the selection of Communist China's leaders.
   In a touch of democracy, 144 candidates were listed for the 135
ordinary seats on the congress' standing committee. Delegates also
were told they could write in other names if they did not like the
144 choices.
   Also for the first time, legislators could mark their ballots in
secret in enclosed areas in the rear of the hall. Most delegates,
however, remained in their seats.
   Deng and Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang were among the
delegates who voted.
   The official Xinhua News Agency announced the results but did
not give vote counts.
   Yang and Wan are both strong supporters of Deng's decade-long
program of introducing market-style economic reforms and shaking up
the stagnant government bureaucracy.
   The officials they replace _ 78-year-old Li Xiannian in the
presidency and 86-year-old Peng Zhen as congress chairman _ were
regarded as more conservative.
   As president, Yang will play a highly visible role in meeting
visiting foreign heads of state and presenting China's policy to
them. His close ties to Deng give him an influence beyond the
presidency.
   Wan's new job as head of the National People's Congress was a
powerless one for many years, but under Peng the legislature became
more active in debating bills and even pressing for amendments.
   Deng's decision to stay on as head of the Central Military
Commission had been anticipated. The military has been his power
base since he became top leader in 1978.
   In other posts, Wang Zhen, 80, a Long March veteran and Central
Military Commission member, was elected vice president.
   Nineteen vice-chairmen of the congress standing committee were
elected, including 11 who had served as vice chairman of the
previous congress' standing committee.
   Among the eight elected for the first time were Fei Xiaotong,
77, a sociologist and head of the China Democratic League, one of
China's eight officially approved non-Communist parties.

<HEAD>Grade A Eggs Linked To Salmonella Outbreaks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raw or undercooked eggs _ even from perfect and
sanitized shells _ may be spreading the salmonella bacteria in the
Northeast, says a federal researcher who fears the problem may be
spreading.
   Even sound Grade A eggs, which are screened for defects and
cleansed outside with chemical disinfectant, appear to be
implicated in the sickening of hundreds of people in recent years,
the researcher said Thursday.
   Previous egg-related salmonella food poisoning has been limited
to eggs that were cracked, dirty or in some other way defective or
mishandled, said Dr. Michael E. St. Louis of the national Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   St. Louis said in a telephone interview, though, that his
findings now implicate Grade A eggs _ the most widely sold egg in
whole shell form. He said, however, that fully cooked eggs appear
to present no danger.
   ``In all of the outbreaks we investigated, people ate the eggs
raw or undercooked,'' St. Louis said. ``Consumers don't need to
stop eating eggs, but if they wish to avoid salmonella infections,
they need to cook the eggs.''
   Cathy McCharen, a spokeswoman for the egg industry-funded Egg
Nutrition Center in Washington, D.C., said ``We're doing everything
possible to correct and identify any problems.''
   St. Louis and his colleagues began their investigation after
learning of a sixfold increase in the number of infections caused
by the bacteria salmonella enteritidis in Northeastern states from
1976 to 1986.
   The researchers found that in the nine affected states from
January 1985 to May 1987, 65 food-borne outbreaks of salmonella
enteritidis occurred and were associated with 2,119 food-poisoning
cases and 11 deaths.
   In 35 outbreaks, the food bearing the infection could be
identified, the researchers said. Twenty-seven of those 35
outbreaks ``were caused by Grade A shell eggs or food that
contained such eggs,'' the researchers added.
   A separate survey of records concerning all U.S. salmonella
outbreaks from 1973 to 1984 revealed that ``egg-containing foods
were disproportionately associated with salmonella enteritidis
infections both in the Northeast and in the rest of the United
States,'' the researchers said.
   They reported their findings in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   Dr. Robert C. Baker, a food science professor at Cornell
University in Ithaca, N.Y., said, however, that he believes the
danger may be over and that the rash of outbreaks may have run its
course.
   Baker, a long-time researcher into egg safety, said in a
telephone interview Wednesday that lab tests at 53 New York State
farms last year failed to turn up any trace of salmonella
enteritidis contamination.
   ``We don't think the problem is going away,'' St. Louis
countered. ``Outbreaks continue to occur. ... It's continuing to
rise in the Northeast, and it's actually spreading out of the
Northeast.''
   Ms. McCharen added in a telephone interview Wednesday that CDC
researchers established a statistical link between some _ not all _
Northeastern salmonella outbreaks and eggs, and ``what they don't
know is why.''
   St. Louis agreed, saying one possible explanation is that
salmonella infection may contaminate the ovaries of chickens and
infect yolks before shells are formed.
   But he emphasized, ``We think the frequency of eggs being
contaminated with salmonella is very low.''
   He said about one-third of all chicken and turkey sold in stores
is salmonella-contaminated, and slightly less than a third of the
ground beef, but those infections are destroyed by cooking.
   In contrast, eggs often are eaten raw _ in hollandaise sauces,
Caesar salad dressings, homemade egg nog and ice cream, the
researchers said.
   Where eggs are concerned, sufficient cooking is difficult to
determine, but a previous study has suggested boiling for at least
seven minutes, poaching for five minutes and frying on each side
for at least three minutes, the study said.
   The Northeastern states included in the study were Connecticut,
Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.

<HEAD>JAMA Editor: Euthanasia Debate Must Go Forward To Develop Ethical
Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``It's Over, Debbie,'' a doctor's essay on the
mercy killing of a patient, has focused debate on euthanasia much
like the Karen Ann Quinlan case did in the 1970s, says a prominent
medical journal's editor.
   The newly galvanized debate over euthanasia will be fruitless,
however, unless it results in guidelines enabling doctors to deal
with ethical dilemmas, Dr. George Lundberg wrote for today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``Such discussions should not be confined to whispers in
doctors' dressing rooms and hallways,'' says the editorial in JAMA,
which started the debate by publishing the unsigned essay Jan. 8.
   In addition to the editorial, today's issue of JAMA included two
commentaries on the essay and excerpts from 18 of the more than 150
letters the journal received.
   The essay's author described injecting a potentially lethal dose
of morphine into a 20-year-old hospital patient dying of ovarian
cancer.
   The physician, a gynecology resident awakened in the middle of
the night to attend the woman, indicated the patient was a
stranger, but that her pain and her plea, ``Let's get this over
with,'' were moving.
   ``I believe the stark nature of the essay and the ambiguities
within it, when coupled with a profession and public ready to talk
about dying in greater detail, produced this massive national
response,'' said Lundberg.
   ```Debbie' crystallized attention (on euthanasia) for this
decade much as the Karen Quinlan case in the previous decade,'' he
added.
   The parents of Miss Quinlan, who lapsed into a coma in 1975,
obtained court permission in 1976 to withdraw life-support systems.
Miss Quinlan never regained consciousness, and died nine years
later.
   In his editorial, Lundberg sought to guide the course of the
euthanasia debate by identifying six types of euthanasia, ranging
from withholding resuscitation of terminal patients to killing a
patient through such means as drug injection.
   He warned that, without action, laws may eventually result
without sufficient input from the public and the medical profession.
   The essay has already caused legal action by a local prosecutor.
   Cook County State's Attorney Richard Daley served JAMA with a
subpoena shortly after the essay's publication, seeking the name of
the author in an effort to determine whether a crime occurred.
   Journal editors refused, saying the essay was offered on
condition of anonymity. A judge quashed the subpoena on March 18,
citing Illinois' free-press law.
   Questions also have been raised about whether the event
described actually happened. Lundberg said he believes the case is
real.
   Lundberg noted that active euthanasia already is performed in
the Netherlands and a public referendum on the practice may be on
the California ballot this year.
   ``The issues raised by this particularly abhorrent case and the
consequent discussion about the ethics of euthaniasia are profound,
eternal questions of humnan existence for which there are no
necessarily `correct' and certainly no clear answers,'' he said in
the editorial.
   In an interview Wednesday, Lundberg said most of the early
letters were from doctors. They ran 4-to-1 against the action
described in the essay and 3-to-1 against JAMA's decision to
publish it, he said.
   Dr. William Fiorini of Somerset, Ohio, wrote, ``I ponder the
prospect that in my final struggle, a similar white-coated figure
will cast a shadow over my deathbed, poised to quickly administer
the knockout blow and go back to bed, when I simply rang for a
companion to ease my pains.''
   The public response was more favorable, Lundberg said, but he
provided no figures. Those letters suggested support for euthanasia
in some situations, he said.
   ``Look at the courts and you will see a very small percentage of
convictions for mercy killings and assisted suicides,'' wrote
Eileen Moran of Everett, Wash. ``Juries are filled with people of
conscience who wish the same deliverance from a life whose quality
has passed.
   ``To all those physicians who would deny me a lethal injection,
on request, as I lie dying, I say, `Whose life is it, anyway?'''

   Iranians voted for a new parliament today,
hours after Iraqi missiles crashed into several cities, in an
election that will help determine the course of the Islamic
revolution.
   The nation's 87-year-old revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, voted at an open-air election station near his
home in the northern Tehran suburb of Jamaran.
   State-run television showed the black-turbaned leader dropping
his ballot into the box, followed by his son Ahmad. The elections
are the third to the 270-member Majlis, or parliament, since the
1979 revolution toppled the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
   The vote is seen as a test of strength between fundamentalists
who support an Islamic-style capitalism and radicals who favor a
socialist-style economy. The future course of the Islamic
revolution is uncertain, and Khomeini is reported in ill health.
   Iranian leaders had expressed fear the Iraqis would blitz Tehran
and other major cities to disrupt the polling, but nevertheless
urged the country's more than 20 million voters to cast ballots in
defiance.
   A loud explosion rocked the area near a Tehran railroad station
just hours before Iran's 30,000 polling stations opened. Officials
had no immediate details of the blast.
   But Tehran radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.,
reported that Iraqi missiles crashed into the capital and the
central city of Isfahan. It also said Iraqi warplanes raided the
western cities of Bakhtaran and Hamadan, killing an unspecified
number of civilians.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus,
did not give any turnout figures but reported the Iranian people's
``massive presence'' at the polling stations.
   Khomeini declared last week: ``The people will attend the
election with God's help, even if they are under missile attack. I
will vote under any circumstances.''
   He warned: ``The people must beware and choose candidates among
... those loyal to Islam. They must choose their deputies from
among those who have suffered from poverty and are real Moslems,
not those who obey America's Islam.''
   Tehran was decked out in election posters, including
bedsheet-size cloth banners bearing the names of the candidates.
   The 7{-year-old war with Iraq, the country's most pressing
problem, has not figured in the campaigning. Khomeini has decreed
that the war will not end until his adversary, Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein, has been toppled.
   About 1,400 candidates ran for the four-year terms as
parliamentary deputies. They were approved by provincial and city
governors controlled by Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
   That's about 400 more than campaigned in the last election in
1984. This year, for the first time, about 30 women ran.
   The results may not be known for 10 days, and the new parliament
may not sit until June while a new cabinet is screened and nominees
scrutinized by the deputies.

   Psychologist, author and teacher B.F.
Skinner, who suffered a fall in his kitchen just before Christmas,
said he is doing fine following an operation for a head injury
suffered in the accident.
   ``It's not a news story at all,'' Skinner, 84, who was injured
Dec. 20, said Thursday. ``I just slipped and fell and had a slight
concussion.''
   Skinner, a pioneer in behavioral psychology at Harvard
University, said he underwent an operation four weeks ago to
relieve pressure from the head injury and was released from the
hospital two weeks later.
   ``I'm in fine shape and I'm back home,'' said the author of
``Behavior of Organisms'' in 1938 and the utopian novel ``Walden
Two'' in 1948.
   Skinner, who retired in 1974, said he plans to close his office
at the university in September. Skinner came to Harvard as a
graduate student in 1928, and has taught at the University of
Minnesota and Indiana University.

<HEAD>High Winds Abate in West but Snow Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong winds that wracked much of the West, blowing over five
semitrailer trucks in Utah and damaging roofs in Nevada, began to
ease today while other western areas dug out from snow.
   A strong low pressure system over Wyoming combined with a strong
high pressure system off the central Pacific coast to produce the
intense winds Thursday night across parts of the western United
States.
   The stiff winds, gusting up to 63 mph, knocked over the five
semitrailer trucks and blew out windows in four other vehicles near
Wendover, Utah.
   In Nevada, winds were clocked at 60 mph in Elko County and there
were reports of roof damage to homes in the Wells and Spring Creek
areas. A hanger door at the Battle Mountain airport was damaged by
a gust clocked at 82 mph.
   High wind warnings over northwest Utah and much of eastern
Nevada were canceled, but wind advisories remained in effect today
over southern Nevada and northern deserts of southern California
where winds of 25 to 40 were expected.
   Also in the West, snow was scattered over the northern Rockies.
Snow advisories were in effect for portions of central and southern
Montana and for the northern mountains of Wyoming. Some roads in
Yellowstone Park, Wyo., were closed because of the heavy snow.
   In the East, rain continued to fall across much of the upper
Ohio Valley and the middle Atlantic coast states. Rain also was
scattered over North Carolina. Cloudy skies and scattered light
drizzle extended across New England.
   Today's forecast called for rain from New England across eastern
and central New York, the middle Atlantic coast states and North
Carolina; rain and mountain snow from southern Montana through
Utah; showers scattered over eastern Wyoming, the western Dakotas
and across southwest Texas; gusty winds over California and
southern Nevada.
   High temperatures were expected in the 60s or 70s over much of
the nation; in the 40s and 50s from the northern half of the
Pacific coast through Utah, Wyoming and Montana and from the Great
Lakes across the upper Ohio Valley and the northern and middle
Atlantic coast states; in the 80s and low 90s over the desert
southwest; in the 80s across the southern and central Plains,
southern Iowa, Missouri, the lower Mississippi Valley and south
Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 21
degrees at Burns, Ore., to 78 degrees at Glendale, Ariz.

<HEAD>Famous Gorilla `Willie B.' Will Soon Move Outside</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `For Willie ...' to insert dropped word

<TEXT>
   Willie B., one of America's most famous gorillas,
has a new human roommate who's trying to coax the pudgy primate
into taking his first step outside in 25 years.
   Later this month, his keepers at Zoo Atlanta plan to introduce
Willie and his fellow apes to a new outdoor habitat, which replaces
the tile walls and steel bars of their old quarters.
   ``Gorillas tend to be very reticent, and after 25 years in the
same place, he's just gotten used to his old home,'' zoo Director
Terry Maple said. ``This change, although it's a very positive
change, is going to be viewed with some suspicion. We're going to
have to induce him to enjoy his new habitat.
   ``Once he gets over this period, we think he's going to really
enjoy it.''
   For Willie, who arrived in Atlanta 25 years ago at age 3, it
might be the first time in his memory that he will have grass
beneath his feet and the open sky above his head.
   And zoo officials have other surprises for Willie. They hope
that within a year they can introduce him to another gorilla,
probably a female.
   ``We're going to have to do it very carefully, so they don't
fight too much,'' Maple said Thursday. Eventually, he said, it's
hoped Willie will breed.
   On Wednesday, Zoo Atlanta officials gave Willie his first
complete physical, then showed him the new indoor quarters he will
use for sleep and shelter. They hope he'll get used to that within
two weeks, and then, they will open the door.
   To coax him outside, keepers will place Willie's food near the
exit of his night quarters. He already can see that something is
going on; zoo staffers are keeping a round-the-clock watch in the
night quarters, including his keeper of 14 years, Charles Horton,
who is sleeping in the next chamber.
   ``He's literally Willie's best friend,'' Maple said. ``Charles
is a very important part of our strategy of making him
comfortable.''
   In Wednesday's physical, Willie B. _ named for long-time former
Atlanta Mayor William B. Hartsfield _ weighed in at nearly 460
pounds, with a 40-inch neck and a 64-inch chest.
   That's about 60 pounds overweight, but for a gorilla who's lived
in a cage for 25 years, it's not too bad, Maple said.
   ``The preliminary results are that he's in very good health,''
Maple said. ``We're surprised at his muscle tone and the quality of
his condition.''
   Willie's first steps outdoors will be important for him, and
equally important for Zoo Atlanta, Maple said.
   The U.S. Humane Society named the 99-year-old zoo one of the
nation's worst just four years ago, before Maple, a specialist in
primate psychology, was hired and launched a plan to convert the
old facility into a modern outdoor animal habitat.
   ``This is the dawning of a new era at Zoo Atlanta; I have no
doubt about that,'' he said. ``You can call it one small step for a
gorilla, one giant step for gorilla kind _ and certainly for the
zoo.''

<HEAD>Researchers Discover New Dinosaur In Old Skull</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE NANO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A misidentified dinosaur skull found in the
Cleveland Museum of Natural History's basement came from a
previously unknown meat-eating reptile that was a pygmy cousin of
Tyrannosaurus rex, scientists say.
   The skull was found on a southeast Montana farm 46 years ago by
a museum expedition, but was misidentified as a gorgosaur, a
relatively primitive, common carnivore, scientists said at a news
conference Thursday.
   The new genus has been named Nanotyrannus, or ``pygmy tyrant,''
by the three scientists who discovered it.
   ``This animal is so different from any other meat-eater that it
merits its own branch of the tyrannosaur family tree,'' said Robert
T. Bakker, adjunct curator of paleontology at the University of
Colorado in Boulder.
   Bakker said he found the skull, believed to be the only
Nanotyrannus specimen, while rummaging around the museum's basement
last spring.
   ``The best place in North America to find new (kinds) of
dinosaurs ...is to look in basements, he said. ``There are never
enough scientists to study specimens as soon as they come out of
the crate. This came out of the crate in 1942. But no one did a
detailed study.''
   Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the Earth some 60 million years ago.
Nanotyrannus resembled the bigger dinosaur, but was only about
one-third as large and one-tenth as heavy. It probably weighed less
than 1,000 pounds, stood about 10 feet tall, walked on its hind
legs and measured about 17 feet from nose to tail, Bakker said.
   The skull, about 22 inches long and 10 inches high, is about the
size of a brown bear's head, Bakker said.
   Nanotyrannus had the same advanced anatomical features as
Tyrannosaurus rex, including eye sockets that faced forward instead
of sideways and a neck joint that bent downwards.
   The expedition that found the skull yielded other dinosaur
skeletons in the musuem's collection, but no other Nanotyrannus
parts.
   ``It's very rare to find a perfect head and no backbone or no
hind leg or tail or ribs,'' Bakker said. ``It's not impossible that
the body is still out there entombed in very hard sandstone.''
   There are no plans to excavate the site again, said Michael
Williams, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the musuem. The
third scientist involved in the discovery was Philip Currie,
assistant director of the Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in
Alberta, Canada.
   Williams said the skull had been on display, but not for at
least the last 10 years.
   Bakker said Tyrannosaurus rex is the most popular dinosaur among
children he gives talks to.
   ``I think Tyrannosaurus rex wil continue to be the favorite
dinosaur, but I bet you the pygmy tyrant becomes the second most
popular,'' he said.

   Students stormed two U.S. Embassy
annex buildings and set them ablaze before they were dispersed with
bullets, beatings and tear gas. At least five demonstrators were
killed and 10 wounded.
   An Embassy spokesman reported extensive damage from Thursday
night's attack, but said no U.S. citizens were injured.
   Police said the crowd of more than 1,000 university students
also set fire to about 25 automobiles belonging to embassy
personnel that were parked near the annex complex.
   The students were protesting the forced extradition this week of
an alleged drug trafficker suspected of involvement in the killing
of a U.S. drug agent. They also voiced anger at President Reagan's
dispatch of additional American troops to Honduras last month.
   Private Honduran guards posted at the embassy fired shots and
lobbed tear gas grenades at the demonstrators from inside the main
embassy building across the street from the annex buildings, said
police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But Michael O'Brien, the Embassy spokesman, said neither U.S.
Marine guards nor Honduran guards stationed at the embassy complex
took violent action against the protesters. He said Honduran riot
police had fired on the crowd.
   Police identified the dead as Betty Molina, Alberto Pineda,
Almencar Aguero, Rolando Herrazo and Henry Mencitta.
   They said the four men were university students and Molina was a
child who had accompanied her mother to the protest. Ages were not
immediately available for the dead.
   The riot police did not arrive at the embassy complex until
nearly two hours after the demonstration began. No explanation was
given for the delay.
   Several of the demonstrators were seen carrying pistols and
students told reporters they had disarmed about 10 of the private
embassy guards. Police said none of the guards were injured.
   All the contents of two floors of a four-story annex building
housing U.S. Information Agency offices were destroyed by the blaze
and the windows of both annex buildings were shattered by the
students.
   O'Brien, in a telephone interview, said demonstrators had surged
into an annex complex: ``There was a lot of damage. They burned a
number of goods.''
   He would not say what goods or documents were stored in the
annex, and also said no U.S. citizens were hurt.
   Red Cross officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that in addition to those killed, 10 demonstrators were
hospitalized with injuries from bullets, beatings and tear gas.
   The three-hour demonstration began at the National Autonomous
University, located on the outskirts of Tegucigalpa.
   Shouting anti-U.S. slogans, the students marched seven miles to
the embassy, located in an eastern district of the city.
   When they arrived, the demonstrators broke into two embassy
annex structures, spreading gasoline inside and setting them ablaze.
   The demonstrators dispersed when police and army troops arrived,
but regrouped and said they planned to march to President Jose
Azcona Hoyo's residence, located about 300 yards south of the
embassy.
   But about 200 heavily-armed troops quickly surrounded Azcona's
residence, stopping the demonstrators from approaching.
   Lisandro Quesada, government press secretary, said in a national
radio broadcast Thursday night that Azcona regretted the incident.
Quesada appealed to university students for calm.
   The military command posted army troops throughout Tegucigalpa
overnight to protect government buildings. Streets were calm early
today.
   On Tuesday, Honduran officials took Juan Ramon Matta Ballasteros
from his Tegucigalpa home in a pre-dawn raid and hustled him onto a
plane to the Dominican Republic without a passport.
   Dominican Republic officials put Matta on a New York-bound
flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by U.S. marshals,
according to U.S. law enforcement officials.
   Matta, held at the maximum-security federal prison in Marion,
Ill., was wanted by U.S. officials for questioning in the 1985
slaying in Mexico of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Adminstration agent,
Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   Honduran legislators angrily called the incident a
``kidnapping'' and the Foreign Ministry launched an investigation
of the procedures used.
   The protesters who stormed the Embassy annex Thursday also were
demonstrating against the presence of 3,200 U.S. troops in Honduras
last month.
   Reagan dispatched the troops at Azcona's request after a
reported incursion into Honduras by Nicaraguan troops pursuing
Contra rebels. The U.S. troops later returned home.

<HEAD>Officer Who Waited for Key to Apartment at Scene of Rape Is
Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALUMET CITY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city has fired a police officer
who waited outside an apartment building for a key for nearly 30
minutes while officials say a 12-year-old girl was being raped
inside.
   James Horka, 39, was dismissed Thursday night after a divided
city commission found him guilty of violating five departmental
rules. Horka, an officer for 14 years, said he would appeal his
dismissal.
   ``If I could have changed it in any way, if I would have known
what was going on, believe me, it would not have happened that
way,'' Horka said. ``I still think I did the right thing. No one
got killed.''
   Horka was accused of breaking 10 department rules. The Police
and Fire Commission dismissed the most serious allegation, failing
to request assistance at the scene.
   City attorney Howard Rosenfeld said he was shocked by dismissal
of that count but pleased that Horka had been dismissed.
   ``Officers who have a right to carry a gun and a badge have a
tremendous obligation to the public,'' Rosenfeld said. ``They must
meet that obligation if they wish to remain police officers. In our
opinion, Officer Horka did not meet those obligations.''
   Horka was found in violation of conduct unbecoming an officer,
unsatisfactory performance in the line of duty, improper filing of
a report, abuse of command at the scene, and violation of rules.
The last means that since Horka was found in violation of any
department rule, he was found in violation of that regulation as
well.
   The disciplinary hearings began shortly after Horka and two
other officers answered a report of a home invasion on Dec. 21.
   Horka maintained he did not break into the apartment upon
arriving because he feared the assailant might harm the girl and
her 10-year-old brother inside.
   They waited outside almost 30 minutes with the girl's frantic
mother for the landlord to bring a key, rather than breaking in to
rescue the girl.
   Four officers later entered the apartment through a back door,
which had been unlocked, and arrested Benjamin Valentine, 19, of
Chicago. Valentine was charged with rape, burglary, home invasion
and aggravated kidnapping; he is awaiting trial.
   The two officers who accompanied Horka also are scheduled for
disciplinary hearings.

<HEAD>Women Investigated In Lesbianism Probe At Marine Base</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARRIS ISLAND, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marine Corps has carried out
``witch hunts'' for lesbians while tolerating homosexual men, says
a Marine who says she is a target in a lesbianism investigation at
the service's East Coast boot camp.
   The Corps denies the accusation, although statistics show a
disproportionate number of women have been dismissed for
homosexuality.
   The Naval Investigative Service's investigation at the Marine
Corps Recruit Depot centers on 10 women and is likely to expand,
said the woman Marine, who denies being homosexual and has not been
charged.
   Five Marine women have been charged with various counts,
including committing indecent acts. Two other women who were due to
go before administrative hearing boards are seeking discharges.
   ``Every base I've been on has had one of these so-called witch
hunts,'' said the woman, a member of the Marines for six years who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``This is the only time I've know
of that anyone has gone to the press.''
   She said she did so ``to show there's an injustice being done.''
   ``If they're going to conduct these investigations, they need to
do it on the male side of the house as well,'' she said.
   ``It would be such an embarrassment for the men to do this,''
she said. ``They would have to admit that among the few and the
proud they also have some gays in there.''
   Each year, 20,000 recruits, men and women, pass through Parris
Island, the Corps' only basic training base for woman Marines.
There are 10,060 women in the Marines.
   According to Defense Department figures, 90 women and 219 men
have been dismissed for homosexuality in the past three federal
fiscal years, although women comprise less than 5 percent of the
Corps.
   During the same period, 662 Marine homosexuality cases were
investigated, the figures show. About a third of those
investigations centered on women.
   However, Corps spokeswoman Joanne Schilling in Washington said
lesbians do not get special attention while homosexual men are
tolerated. She said there is no clear reason for the disparity and
that the matter has never been studied.
   She said that it would be a commanding officer's responsibility
to check out any reported violations of a military law.
   The Parris Island investigation is not routine, but ``it's not
an unprecedented thing,'' said Maj. Robert McLean, a base
spokesman. The base doesn't announce such hearings, but will answer
media inquiries about them, McLean said.
   He said that while records of such cases are usually kept only
about two years, he understands there were similar proceedings
three or four years ago. The current proceedings are Article 32
hearings, which are similar to civilian grand jury hearings.
   They amount to an open investigation into the allegations in
which the defendants have certain rights and witnesses for both
sides can be called. Following the hearing, the investigating
officer makes a non-binding recommendation to the Marine's
commanding officer.
   The recommendation may be that the charges go to a
court-martial, that the Marine go before an administrative
discharge board or that the charges be dismissed.
   An administrative discharge board would determine whether the
defendant has the potential for further service. A court-martial
could lead to a prison sentence.
   In addition to committing indencent acts, the defendants face
various charges, including dereliction of duty, sodomy, conspiracy
to obstruct justice and assault.
   McLean noted that not all the charges are related to
homosexuality and ``in a larger sense, we are talking about
breaches of good order and discipline.''
   The Corps doesn't tolerate homosexuality because it is
``contrary to good order and discipline, not because there is a
statement being made about lifestyles,'' he said.
   He added that recruit training ``must be conducted with the
highest standards of order and discipline.''

   Four Israeli troops were wounded today when the
army jeep they were in hit a roadside mine in southern Lebanon, an
army spokesman said.
   The spokesman said the troops were patrolling near the village
of Merkaba in the center of Israel's self-declared ``security
zone'' when they drove by the mine.
   At the same time, attackers fired at the troops from a distance,
the spokesman said. The troops fired back and gave chase to the
attackers, who managed to flee the security zone.
   Two soldiers suffered light wounds and two suffered moderate
wounds, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity in line with
regulations. The four were evacuated to a hospital.
   Israel established its security zone, a six-to-10-mile wide
strip of land north of the Israeli-Lebanese border, when it
withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in 1985 following a
three-year occupation.
   The zone is patrolled by Israeli troops and Israeli-allied
Lebanese militiamen.

   The date of the signature ceremony has not yet been fixed but
will not be later than next Thursday, Cordovez told reporters after
nearly six weeks of painful negotiations in the latest round of
indirect talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   Setting the time of signature ``involves a number of logistical
questions,'' Cordovez said, adding he hoped to be able to announce
a firm date later today.
   Apart from the two negotiating parties, the accord as foreseen
calls for the United States and the Soviet Union to sign as
guarantors.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his Afghan ally Najib said jointly
Thursday that ``the last obstacles to concluding the agreements
have now been removed'' and that Soviet troops can start leaving on
May 15 if the agreement is signed quickly.
   The United States is the main weapons supplier to the
guerrillas, who have been fighting the Soviet-backed Kabul
government for a decade. Soviet troops intervened in December 1979
and 115,000 have been fighting there since.

<HEAD>Children Reunited With Mother After Two Years in Woods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SNELLVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three children who spent two years in a
tent in the Maine wilderness after allegedly being kidnapped by
their father are back in Georgia with their mother.
   They were reunited Thursday with Amelia Doellefeld in a Bangor,
Maine, courthouse. By evening, they were home in this town about 20
miles northeast of Atlanta.
   ``I just remember my legs were shaking _ I was shaking all
over,'' Mrs. Doellefeld said, referring to the tearful reunion.
   FBI agents arrested the father, 52-year-old Tex Donald
Doellefeld, as a fugitive from justice in the tiny central Maine
town of Greenville late Wednesday. He was released from the
Penobscot County Jail after posting $20,000 bond, a jail spokesman
said.
   Gwinnett County authorities began extradition proceedings after
Gwinnett District Attorney Tom Lawler said he opposed Doellefeld's
release.
   The children _ Jason, 13; Beth, 11; and Max, 9 _ were dirty but
in good condition.
   ``I was talking to Beth and she said it was like being on
vacation,'' said Lyn Mealor, the children's aunt.
   ``I thought many times they were dead and just not knowing was
the worst,'' Mrs. Doellefeld said. ``Are they hurt? Are they safe?
Are their needs being met? At one point, it was so black.
   ``One night I said to myself, I've got to do something or else I
am going to die,'' she said.
   Officials in Maine said Doellefeld was discovered after school
officials recognized photographs of the children printed on an FBI
flier. They said Doellefeld was teaching his children through a
state-approved home tutoring program and was visited by school
officials once a month.
   Paul Fourier, a spokesman for Maine's Inland Fisheries and
Wildlife Department, said Doellefeld had been living with the
children for about two years in a heavily wooded area accessible
this time of year only by snowmobile or seaplanes that could land
on a nearby lake.
   Doellefeld, a homebuilder, lived in an elaborate, well-insulated
tent set up on a wooden platform, Fourier said.
   After Doellefeld allegedly kidnapped the children from their
home in August 1986, a Gwinnett County grand jury indicted him on
three counts of interference with child custody, a felony. A
Gwinnett judge issued a warrant charging him with being a fugitive
from justice in March 1987.

<TEXT>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said
it is defying an Ethiopian government order to leave that country's
war-torn northern Tigre and Eritrea provinces, where there is
drought and famine.
   The Red Cross asked authorities to let relief agencies continue
their work in the provinces.
   ``Intensified fighting has made the needs of the civilian
population living in conflict zones particularly urgent,'' the
committee said in a statement Thursday night. ``There is now an
even greater need to continue and even increase the protection and
assistance activities.''
   The agency has stopped virtually all relief work in the two
provinces. But it's roughly 25 delegates are staying in the area in
hopes the Marxist government will revise its stand, committee
official Catherine Peduzzi said.
   The agency said it is committed to uphold its mandate as a
neutral intermediary in conflict areas, citing a ``humanitarian
responsibility for the fate of some 5 million people'' in the two
provinces.
   Children are showing very high levels of malnutrition, the
statement said.
   The Ethiopian government told international relief agencies
Wednesday to recall all foreign workers from Tigre and Eritrea for
security reasons. President Mengistu Haile Mariam said last week
that government troops are mobilizing to crush a long-standing
rebellion in region.
   The Red Cross said it immediately asked the government to
reconsider the expulsion order.
   Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years against the
central government in Ethiopia in Africa's longest civil war.
   In neighboring Tigre, another separatist group, the Tigre
People's Liberation Front, has been fighting for 14 years.
   The hostilities have disrupted relief efforts in both regions,
where crop failures threaten 3.5 million people with starvation.
Overall, nearly 7 million Ethiopians face famine without outside
aid.

<HEAD>Mozambique Blames South Africa For Car Bomb Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government-controlled media blamed
South Africa today for a car bombing that seriously injured a white
member of the African National Congress.
   South Africa denied responsibility.
   Albie Sachs, a South African lawyer, remained in a Maputo
hospital after the Thursday morning explosion that occurred as he
entered his car outside his apartment in downtown Maputo.
   Sachs was jailed by South African authorities for more than
three months without charge in 1963. He also defended members of
the congress.
   The congress, banned in 1960, is the major guerrilla group
fighting South Africa's white-led government.
   He has lived in Mozambique for 10 years and works at the
country's Ministry of Justice.
   ``The long and criminal arm of the Pretoria regime has again
reached into Maputo to carrry out another savage and odious
crime,'' said Noticias, a Maputo daily.
   ``Sachs committed what is, in the eyes of Pretoria, the greatest
of all crimes: he frontally opposed apartheid, he openly challenged
the racist regime,'' the front-page editorial added.
   Reports on Mozambican radio and television also blamed South
Africa, the national news agency AIM reported.
   South Africa's government-run television quoted Foreign Minister
Roelof Botha as saying that South Africa ``could not be held
responsible for the conflict in Mozambique and certainly not for
violence which emanated from faction fighting in the ANC.''
   None of the Mozambican reports cited any evidence linking South
Africa to the blast, but they noted a recent series of attacks
carried out against ANC members.
   At least six congress members have been killed in countries
outside South Africa this year. South Africa has denied
responsibility for the deaths, although it repeatedly warns it will
cross its borders in pursuit of members.
   Tom Lodge, a political scientist at Johannesburg's University of
the Witwatersrand and an expert on the congress, said Sachs was a
member, but that he was not actively working for the group in
Mozambique and was not an officer in the organization, which is
composed mainly of blacks.
   The U.S. Embassy in Maputo condemned the attack and said, ``We
note that the incident takes place after several recent attacks
against purported members of the ANC.''
   South Africa and Mozambique signed a mutual non-aggression pact
in 1984, but both sidely regularly accuse the other of violations.
   Sachs, born in 1935, was the son of a prominent trade unionist.
Sachs was one of the few whites who participated in the African
National Congress' defiance campaign that led to the organization's
banning in 1960. The campaign urged people to ignore apartheid
laws, resulting in thousands of arrests.
   After being released from detention in 1963, Sachs wrote a book
about his experiences, ``The Prison Diary of Albie Sachs,'' which
was turned into a stage play in Britain.
   He worked in Britain before going to Mozambique. As an employee
of the Justice Ministry, he had just begun drafting a new family
law for Mozambique, AIM said.
   The explosion shattered windows in the nearby Portuguese Embassy
and hurled pieces of the car as much as 50 yards away, AIM reported.
   By law and custom in South Africa, apartheid establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Police patrolling gang-infested neighborhoods
awash in drugs, bullets and blood are preparing to saturate the
streets of the nation's second-largest city in a declared war on
violence.
   ``We're putting together a task force to suppress gang activity
in the city wherever it's at,'' officer Bill Frio, a department
spokesman, said Thursday. ``We are not going to broadcast how and
when we're going to do it.''
   ``We're out there to let these gang-bangers know that we're
here, we're not going to go away, and this city belongs to the good
people,'' said Detective Tony Celli, using the street slang for
gang member.
   In recent weeks police have arrested hundreds of gang members,
most plying a burgeoning drug trade and enforcing the perimeters of
their ``turf'' with drive-by shootings.
   Gangs were blamed for 387 killings in Los Angeles County in
1987, and as many as 85 so far this year. Violence has continued
despite recent enforcement sweeps, with five people wounded
Wednesday in three drive-by shootings, a common style of attack in
gang wars.
   The anticipated roundup, involving as many to 1,000 police
officers, would be the biggest in a series of mass patrols in
gang-ridden areas south of downtown.
   Gov. George Deukmejian said Thursday that he would send the
California Highway Patrol and possibly even the National Guard to
help local authorities control gang violence if asked to do so by
local officials.
   County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn wrote Deukmejian asking that the
Guard be sent to ride with police officers as a show of force.
   Police Chief Daryl Gates, who has compared the violence to
Lebanon, has won the unprecedented support of politicians fed up
with gang activity.
   Earlier this week, the city finance committee vote 3-0 to
approve a police request for $2.5 million to cover overtime for the
gang sweeps. Approval by the full City Council appears certain on
Tuesday.
   The council also has approved a request for $16 million to hire
400 police officers, largely because of complaints from residents
of poor neighborhoods that they weren't getting enough police
protection.
   And a private group, Mothers Against Gangs in Communities, has
been formed to fight gangs. It plans to push for anti-gang
legislation, to help pay for the funerals of innocent victims of
gang wars and to keep the issue before the public in the style of
Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
   Police provided few details on plans for a sweep that could be
launched this weekend, refusing to elaborate on Gates' promise to
flood the low-income and working-class neighborhoods south of
downtown with blue uniforms.
   Incensed by the Good Friday gang shooting that killed one person
and injured 12 _ none believed to be gang members _ Gates said he'd
deploy 1,000 officers drawn from across the city and working on
overtime.
   In previous sweeps, officers have cruised the streets,
concentrating on street-corner drug markets and stopping people
wearing gang colors. On Wednesday and Thursday, police arrested 210
people for misdemeanors, felonies and outstanding warrants, and 128
of those arrested were alleged gang members.
   Gangs, including the violent Crips and the Bloods which have
spread their activities to cities nationwide, have long been active
in the inner city, and police statistics show no dramatic increase
in the level of violence.
   But authorities say traditional turf battles are giving way to
drug-dealing wars here and throughout the West as Los Angeles gangs
try to control distribution of ``crack,'' the smokeable form of
cocaine.
   Warring gangs, said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, are creating
``homicide that's worse than Beirut.''

   A 9-year-old runaway driving a van on
Interstate 95 fled police at speeds up to 100 mph before crashing
into a guardrail while his teen-age companions slept in the back,
state police said.
   The boy was in critical condition at Johns Hopkins Hospital
today with head and chest injuries, while his 14-year-old brother
and their 12-year-old friend were in satisfactory condition, police
said.
   The boys' names were not released because of their ages, and
investigators were to meet with the youngsters' parents this
morning, Maryland State Police Sgt. James Black said today.
   The three boys, from suburban Trenton, N.J., apparently were en
route to Florida on Thursday in the van owned by the 12-year-old's
parents, police said. The older boys were asleep in the back of the
van during the chase, Black said, and are not cooperating with
investigators.
   State police said they were told that a van was being driven
erratically on the Delaware Turnpike, just across the Maryland line.
   The chase began when a Maryland trooper signaled the van to stop
and it accelerated to speeds of up to 100 mph.
   The driver lost control, and the van veered across the median
strip, slamming into a guardrail and overturning on the northbound
lanes about 10 miles north of downtown Baltimore, police said.

<HEAD>Contras Agree to Resume Peace Talks on April 15</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODOLFO GARCIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-supported rebels have agreed to
resume high-level talks with Nicaragua's government to end a nearly
7-year-old civil war, but said several conditions must be fulfilled
first.
   The directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance said Thursday in a
letter that it had agreed to come to Managua April 15 for the
talks, the first since leaders of the two sides agreed to a
cease-fire plan on March 23.
   The second meeting had been scheduled for April 6, but the
Contras said they were postponing it because the Sandinistas had
failed to fully comply with provisions of the cease-fire agreement
signed in the southern border town of Sapoa.
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, head of the government
delegation and the brother of President Daniel Ortega, had offered
to hold the negotiations either April 9 or April 15.
   Spokesmen for the rebels, known as Contras, charged the
government withheld newsprint from the opposition newspaper La
Prensa, violating the accord's provision for full press freedom in
Nicaragua.
   The government also failed to include all the prisoners the
Contras had asked for when it released 100 political prisoners on
April 1, as called for under the agreement, the Contras said.
   In Thursday's letter to Humberto Ortega, rebel leaders accepted
as an ``involuntary error'' the failure to release all of the
requested political prisoners. It said the government lacked enough
time to arrange for all of the requested names to be released.
   Sandinista and Contra military delegations were to continue
talks today on technical details of providing humanitarian aid to
the rebels and controlling zones where the insurgents are to gather
during a 60-day cease-fire that began on April 1.
   On Thursday, the delegations finished defining exact locations
of the seven rebel zones and began considering a 34-point rebel
plan governing conduct in those zones, said Maj. Gen. Jaoquin
Cuadra, head of the Sandinista military delegation.
   ``We already have discharged an important part of the agenda,
which was the point on localization'' of the zones, Cuadra said
after Thursday's session in Sapoa.
   Cuadra said the government had not formally responded to the
34-point plan presented by the Contras outlining rebel conduct
inside the zones. But he said the plan ``has several positive
points, that perfectly can be considered by the government.''
   The March 23 accord does not specify if and under what
conditions the Contras are to lay down their arms. Contra leaders
have vowed not to.
   Roberto Urroz, a member of the rebel military delegation, called
for complete Contra autonomy in the zones.
   ``What we want is that in the zones we have real control,''
Urroz said, adding the rebels were seeking ``security, integrity
and communications without interference'' from the government.
   Still unresolved were pledges of security for the Contras, how
they would receive food and other supplies, who would control the
areas and how compliance would be verified.
   Meanwhile, President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica announced his
government was prepared to administer a portion of a $48 million
humanitarian aid package for Nicaragua approved by the U.S.
Congress last month to treat Nicaraguan children injured in the
civil war.
   Nicaraguan President Ortega rejected as ``illegal'' plans to
have the U.S. Agency for International Development administer the
aid, including assistance for the Contras.
   The Sapoa accord calls for a neutral party to administer any
outside humanitarian aid for the Contras.
   ``We can never neglect our aid to the children victims of the
war. It is a matter of a humanitarian gesture and I will try to do
it,'' Arias said.
   Arias received the Nobel Peace Prize in December for authoring
the regional peace plan signed by Central America's five presidents
on Aug. 7.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz met
today with President Amil Gemayel of Lebanon in an effort to seal a
Syrian-arranged deal for a new Lebanese constitution to end
Lebanon's 12-year-old civil war.
   Shultz, who is headed home from a futile effort in the Middle
East to try to set up Arab-Israeli peace talks, met with Gemayel at
Larnaca Airport for 90 minutes. The Cyprus stop wasn't announced in
advance.
   After the meeting, Shultz announced that April Glasbie, head of
the Lebanon desk in the U.S. State Department, will go to Beirut to
continue the American mediation. Ms. Glasbie is now in Damascus
holding talks with Syrian leaders.
   Shultz said his talk with Gemayel was ``productive,'' but he
gave no details. After the meeting, Gemayel returned to Lebanon in
the army helicopter which brought him on the 100-mile flight to
Cyprus. He made no statement.
   Shultz told reporters before leaving Amman, Jordan, that
stability in Lebanon would be ``a great advantage in our efforts
against terrorism'' in seeking the release of nine Americans held
hostage in Lebanon.
   He said a new division of power among the competing factions
would help all countries in the area, including Israel, and Syria
itself.
   ``We want to see an election go off successfully'' in Lebanon,
Shultz said, referring to presidential balloting which must be held
by September, when Gemayel's term expires.
   Gemayel, a Maronite Christian, has sought for nearly six years
to gain control of his country. But Syria, Lebanon's more powerful
neighbor to the east, plays a dominant role in Lebanese politics.
   A new distribution of political power in Lebanon could reduce
Syria's military presence there, which is becoming an economic
drain on Damascus.
   Whether it would help American and other hostages is not clear,
although a senior U.S. official said Thursday that Shultz also
talked to Syrian President Hafez Assad about their plight.
   Many of the 22 foreign hostages are believed held by an
Iranian-influenced group, possibly beyond the reach of Syrian
power, although Syria has close ties with Iran. The longest-held
hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   An administration source said Thursday in Santa Barbara, Calif.,
where President Reagan is vacationing, that Reagan sent a letter to
Gemayel expressing concern about the continuing conflict in Lebanon.
   The official said he had not seen the letter, but ``I would
characterize it as underscoring the mutual interests that the
United States and Lebanon have in building peace in the region.''
   In Washington, a State Department official said the United
States was ``serving as a postman between Assad and Gemayel,'' who
have not spoken to each other in over a year.
   The two U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The aim of a new Lebanese constitution would be to modify the
``national pact'' devised in 1943 that allocated the top positions
in the government to specific religious groups.
   The president is a Christian, the premier is a Sunni Moslem and
the speaker of Parliament is a Shiite Moslem. In the ensuing 45
years, Moslems overtook Christians as a majority and demanded a
larger role.
   If the diplomatic effort succeeds, it will mark a turnabout in
Shultz's fortunes in Lebanon.
   Five years ago, he thought he had worked out an agreement
between Lebanon and Israel for the two to cooperate economically,
politically and diplomatically. Syria undercut the accord and it
fell apart.
   In the meantime, Syria increased its power in Lebanon.
   In southern Lebanon, near the Israeli border, the situation is
especially unstable. Palestinians fought with the Shiite Amal
movement while Hezbollah, an Iranian-linked group, was suspected of
kidnappings and hijackings.
   Israel, which drove to Beirut in a 1982 invasion, is arming the
Christian-led South Lebanese Army militia and occupies a strip of
land north of its border.
   Reagan accused Syria in 1986 of promoting terrorism. He ordered
U.S. Ambassador William Eagleton to withdraw, barred high-level
meetings with Syrian officials, stopped sales of high technology
and imposed other sanctions.
   Last September, Eagleton was sent back to Damascus and most of
the sanctions quietly disappeared. Shultz stopped in Damascus twice
last month and returned again Tuesday.
   Assad is an outspoken supporter of the PLO's having a separate
seat at proposed Middle East peace talks. Shultz's plan would
exclude the Palestine Liberation Organization and seat Palestinians
as part of a Jordanian delegation.
   Assad also demands Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a
security belt Syria lost in the 1967 Six-Day War that now serves as
a buffer to protect northern Israeli villages from a resumption of
bombardment from across the border.

   Parliamentary campaigning officially
began today, and the government set National Assembly elections for
April 26.
   The Central Election Management Committee called for fair and
orderly elections and warned against any illegal campaigning.
   The elections will be the first time in 17 years that just one
lawmaker is being elected from each district.
   President Roh Tae-woo of the governing Democratic Justice Party,
elected Dec. 16, is seeking a majority in the one-house
legislature. Division among opposition parties may give the
governing party the edge.
   Candidates immediately began to register with the committee.
About 1,300 candidates were expected to register by the Wednesday
deadline.
   Some campaigning already has begun, with posters going up in
many places and politicians taking advantage of various gatherings
to attack the opposing side.
   Under a new constitution that took effect Feb. 25 aimed at
democratic reform, 224 lawmakers will be elected to four-year terms
from single-member districts.
   An additional 75 seats will be decided under a bonus system
based on the parties' nationwide polling strength.
   In recent elections, two lawmakers were elected from each
district, but that system has been scrapped in response to public
criticism that voters' wishes were not truly represented when the
first runners-up were elected too.
   The governing party is hoping for a total of 163 seats in the
direct voting, giving it 55 percent of the 299 assembly seats.
   In the presidential elections on Dec. 16, Roh won with just 36.6
percent of the vote. Main opposition leaders Kim Young-sam and Kim
Dae-jung received 55 percent of the vote, but split it between them.
   The main opposition Reunification Democratic Party, controlled
by Kim Young-sam, aims at 80 seats in the direct voting. Other
opposition groups, like Kim Dae-jung' Party for Peace and
Democracy, also have urged voters to give the opposition enough
assembly seats to allow it to effectively check the Roh
administration.
   The two Kims and other opposition politicians charge that the
Roh administration is an extension of the preceding government of
Chun Doo-hwan, who left office Feb. 25 after a seven-year term.
   Chun's younger brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, was arrested last week
on charges of embezzling more than $10 million, influence peddling
and tax evasion while heading Saemaul Undong (New Community
Movement), a semi-official rural and urban development program. The
arrest was seen as a move by Roh to distance himself from Chun.
   Kim Dae-jung has accused former President Chun of amassing a
fortune while in office and illegally taking huge sums of money out
of the country to invest in foreign stock, land and other real
estate in the United States and Australia.
   The former president, now traveling in the United States, has
yet to respond to the charges.

<HEAD>Smog-Covered Soviet City Site of Mass Anti-Pollution Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 10,000 residents of an industrial city
in the Ural Mountains staged a street demonstration to protest smog
that has burned skin and caused lung and heart problems, a
newspaper reported.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda, the daily of the youth organization
Komsomol, said the protesters in the city of Nizhny Tagil demanded
that two 45-year-old coke-burning furnaces at a steel plant be
closed.
   ``Who will answer for the 54 stillborn children in 1987?'' a
crying woman said at the demonstration.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda did not say when the protest occurred in
the city of 405,000 people 900 miles east of Moscow, but it
appeared to have been in February or March.
   There have been several reports of environmental protests in the
Soviet Union since Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail S.
Gorbachev came to power three years ago and encouraged freer
expression.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda, in an article published Wednesday, said
the government lists Nizhny Tagil among the 50 Soviet cities whose
pollution level exceeds sanitary standards.
   Smog is common in the city, and in the morning, the faces of
children on the way to kindergarten burn, the newspaper said.
   One doctor said the number of children hospitalized for serious
lung and heart ailments caused by pollution had risen by 33
percent. He didn't say over what period.
   A commission of the Presidium of the Russian republic's Council
of Ministers, the republic's highest governmental body, ordered the
two coke-burning furnaces at the Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Complex
closed last September because of excessive pollution, the newspaper
said.
   But the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy decided to keep the
furnaces open until new, cleaner furnaces were completed.
   The complex, which includes plants that build railroad cars and
boilers, and a cement factory, spews out 629,000 tons of harmful
substances a year, according to Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   The health problems led to what Komsomolskaya Pravda called ``an
explosion in public consciousness.''
   Children sent the top party official of the metallurgical
complex drawings of ``smokestacks, smog enveloping living areas and
the handwritten words: `I don't want to die!'''
   After the demonstration, the minister of ferrous metallurgy
ordered one of the two coke furnaces stopped, but the other
``continues to pollute the city,'' the newspaper said. A petition
signed by 8,500 Nizhny Tagil residents demanding further action has
been sent to the national Council of Ministers, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   A former top aide to impeached Gov. Evan
Mecham has been convicted of theft by extortion for threatening a
parole board member to get him to support a Mecham appointee.
   Sam Steiger, 59, a former five-term congressman, was found
guilty Thursday by a Maricopa County Superior Court jury that
deliberated for 3{ hours.
   Neither Steiger nor his attorney, Tom Karas, would say whether
they planned an appeal. ``We'll take it one step at a time,'' Karas
said.
   ``It's safe to say I'm not real pleased,'' Steiger told
reporters.
   Steiger was found guilty of threatening to withhold permission
for Ron Johnson, a member of the state Board of Pardons and
Paroles, to work as a part-time Tempe justice of the peace, and
threatening to remove him from the board unless he voted to retain
executive director Patricia Costello, a Mecham appointee.
   Judge Ronald Reinstein scheduled a May 6 sentencing for Steiger,
who faces up to five years in prison. Steiger is free on his own
recognizance.
   ``We don't take joy in a conviction, but we feel it was a fair
trial,'' said prosecutor Michael Cudahy, an assistant attorney
general. ``We felt it was a just verdict.''
   Jury foreman Greg Jones said the deciding factor behind the
verdict was ``the tapes of the phone call between Steiger and
Johnson.'' Johnson called Steiger at home from the office of the
state attorney general, who recorded the call.
   Jones said the jurors had no difficulty reaching a verdict. ``We
listened to all the tapes and examined all the evidence again, but
it was unanimous,'' he said.
   Steiger, asked what he'd do differently, said: ``I'd have
probably hung up on Ron Johnson when he called me at home.''
   Reached shortly after the verdict was announced, Mecham said,
``I'm sad to hear it. Sam meant no harm to anybody, and I'm sorry
to hear it.''
   Mecham was removed from office Monday when the state Senate
convicted him of two impeachment charges.
   Steiger denied on the stand Monday that he threatened Johnson or
told him how he should vote.
   But the state alleged that Steiger followed up on the alleged
threat in a letter and a telephone conversation after Johnson voted
with the board majority to seek Ms. Costello's resignation on
grounds of low staff morale.
   Steiger testified that he did suggest that Johnson should back
Ms. Costello but denied that he tried to ``steal'' Johnson's vote
by threatening his job.
   He acknowledged lying to an attorney general's investigator when
he originally denied making the threat.
   Steiger gave up his 3rd Congressional District seat in 1976 to
run unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate.

   Democratic presidential contender Michael
Dukakis held a widening lead over Jesse Jackson two weeks before
New York's primary, a poll indicated today.
   The Marist College Institute for Public Opinion said 47 percent
of likely New York voters picked Dukakis; 31 percent backed Jackson
and 6 percent chose Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
   An additional 8 percent said they would vote for an
``uncommitted'' slate of delegates that hopes to draft New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo for the nomination at the national convention. The
primary is April 19.
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who put his campaign into mothballs on
Thursday, was supported by 2 percent of the Democrats surveyed and
6 percent said they were undecided.
   The margin of error for the poll, conducted Tuesday and
Wednesday, was 5 percentage points.
   In a similar poll conducted in mid-March by the Marist
pollsters, Dukakis was the choice of 37 percent of the Democrats;
Jackson had 28 percent; Gore had 5 percent; uncommitted was at 10
percent; Simon was at 4 percent; and 13 percent said they were
undecided.
   Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute, said Dukakis
appeared to be doing best in the suburban counties surrounding New
York City and in upstate New York. He said Dukakis was running
about even with Jackson in New York City.
   Jackson's support among white voters remained at about 14
percent in the latest Marist poll, the same as in the mid-March
poll.
   Among Jewish voters, who make up about 25 percent of the New
York Democratic primary voters, Dukakis was the choice of 68
percent of those surveyed; Gore was at 10 percent; and Jackson at 9
percent. In the mid-March poll, Dukakis was the choice of 60
percent of the likely Jewish voters; Gore was at 9 percent; and
Jackson was at 4 percent.
   The race appeared to be a bit tighter when only Democrats who
said they were ``very likely'' to vote in the primary were
questioned, said Miringoff, Among that group _ which could be
important if there is a low voter turnout _ Dukakis was at 42
percent; Jackson at 34 percent; Gore at 8 percent; uncommitted at 8
percent; Simon at 2 percent; and 6 percent said they were undecided.
   Regarding Cuomo, 46 percent of those Democrats surveyed said the
governor should run for president, down from 59 percent in
mid-March, while 16 percent said they expected him to eventually
run, down from 24 percent.
   With Cuomo declining to endorse any of the candidates, the
Marist pollsters also asked Democrats if Cuomo should endorse
someone before the New York primary.
   Almost 31 percent said the governor should endorse, 25 percent
said he shouldn't and 43 percent said it didn't make any difference
to them what Cuomo did.
   Cuomo has said he doesn't want to be a candidate, but has
refused to rule out accepting a draft if there is a deadlocked
national convention.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attempted coup attempt last month against
Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega failed ignominiously
when an officer loyal to Noriega locked the plotters inside an
arsenal, a newspaper reported today.
   Citing unidentified senior administration officials, the Chicago
Tribune reported in today's editions that the failure of the
allegedly U.S.-backed coup has left the Reagan administration's
anti-Noriega plans in chaos.
   The newspaper said several anti-Noriega members of the
15,000-member Panama Defense Forces went to the Central American
nation's main arsenal in Panama City last month to obtain guns for
the attempt, pretending to be on official military business.
   The guard commander at the arsenal, however, locked the plotters
inside and reported to his superiors that he thought a coup was in
progress, the newspaper reported.
   Swift action by Noriega's supporters put down the conspiracy and
resulted in the purge or arrest of nearly three dozen anti-Noriega
officers during the last several weeks, the Tribune reported.
   The newspaper quoted a source identified only as a well-placed
military expert as saying the abortive coup demonstrates ``the
depth to which the administration planners have underestimated
Noriega and misunderstood the situation there.''

   Iraq said it fired four missiles into
Iranian cities today hours before Iranians cast ballots in
important parliamentary elections.
   Tehran retaliated by shooting two missiles into Baghdad, another
two into the northern city of Mosul and one into al-Amarah farther
south, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
   The Iraqi News Agency confirmed one of the strikes on Baghdad
and said civilians were killed. It also said Iraqi civilians were
killed when Iranian long-range artillery shelled Iraqi border
cities.
   An Associated Press reporter in Tehran said there was a loud
explosion before dawn near the city's railway station.
   The Iraqi agency said the missiles were fired into Tehran, the
holy city of Qom, the central city of Isfahan and the northwestern
city of Tabriz. Both news agencies were monitored in Nicosia.
   It also said Iraqi warplanes Thursday night raided a ``large
maritime target,'' which usually means an oil tanker. There was no
immediate confirmation from Persian Gulf shipping sources.
   IRNA said missiles landed in residential areas of Tehran and
Isfahan. It gave no casualty toll. It also said Iraqi warplanes
raided several Iranian cities, but gave no further details.
   The Iranian agency said Iranian planes bombed military targets
in northern Iraq, but the Iraqi agency said the planes bombed
residential neighborhoods in the northern city of Amadiya, killing
civilians.
   Iranians went to the polls to elect 270 members of the Majlis,
or parliament, balloting that was expected to increase the power of
radicals who want economic changes such as land reforms, a minimum
wage and policies that favor the poor.
   On Thursday, Iran said its warplanes sneaked through Iraqi radar
into Baghdad and bombed a military base and oil refinery, killing
or wounding dozens of Iraqi soldiers.
   It was the first reported bombing of the Iraqi capital in three
years. Iraq denied the city was hit Thursday, but the ferocity of
Iraqi attacks later gave some credence to the Iranian claims.
   Both sides bombarded each other's cities and towns Thursday with
missiles and reported scores of civilian casualties.
   Also Thursday, a U.N. team arrived in Baghdad to investigate
Iraqi allegations Iran used chemical weapons in a March 30-31
battle in northeastern Iraq. Iran accused Iraq of using chemical
weapons in the same battle.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the end, the four-year corporate war that
forced oil giant Texaco into bankruptcy and the largest civil award
in U.S. history came down to a silent, 10-minute electronic payment
of $3 billion to Pennzoil.
   The transfer settling Pennzoil's takeover lawsuit against Texaco
took place Thursday in a high-security room at Texas Commerce
Bank-Houston _ and, coincidentally, halfway between Pennzoil
headquarters and the Texaco Building.
   As a half-dozen tight-lipped bank and Pennzoil executives
watched, a green computer screen signaled the arrival of four
Texaco payments, starting at 10:03 a.m. and ending at 10:13 a.m.
About a dozen reporters and photographers watched.
   The transfer had to be broken down into four payments, since the
Federal Reserve System can transfer amounts only as high as one
cent short of $1 billion.
   When the transfer was complete, a few people applauded.
   ``We're all very glad it's all over,'' said David Alderson,
Pennzoil assistant treasurer.
   ``Quite frankly, we've been in a holding pattern for over four
years,'' Pennzoil Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke said later Thursday.
   ``We think we're now in a position to invest these funds and to
make up for lost time,'' Liedtke said.
   The settlement of the suit, which stemmed from Texaco's 1984
acquisition of Getty Oil Co., allowed the White Plains, N.Y.-based
company to emerge from bankruptcy protection.
   It was part of Texaco's bankruptcy reorganization plan, which a
federal judge approved March 23. Texaco also will begin paying $2.6
billion to other creditors.
   Pennzoil, looking for long-term ways to invest the windfall,
actually borrowed $3 billion a couple of weeks ago so it could
begin investing it in an orderly manner, spokesman Bob Harper said.
   The war began with Texaco's acquisition of Getty. Pennzoil sued
Texaco, claiming interference with a planned merger between
Pennzoil and Getty.
   In November 1985, a Houston jury shocked Texaco by agreeing with
Pennzoil and awarding the Houston company $10.53 billion in
damages, the largest civil award in U.S. history.
   A state appeals court upheld the verdict, but reduced the $3
billion in punitive damages to $1 billion.
   Nearly a year ago, Texaco filed for bankruptcy protection,
saying it had to do so to avoid posting a potentially ruinous
appeal bond.
   In November, the Texas Supreme Court refused to hear Texaco's
appeal and let the verdict stand. Texaco then said it was going to
the U.S. Supreme Court, but a committee of shareholders proposed
the settlement.
   The premise of Pennzoil's case was that a handshake and a
person's word was as good as a written contract, and that Texaco
violated that rule by plucking Getty from Pennzoil's grasp.
   Texaco contended Getty had invited it to bid and that there was
no valid contract between Pennzoil and Getty because all the papers
had not been signed by the appropriate parties.
   Texaco also put Texas' court system under scrutiny, challenging
the trial judge's credentials and complaining that Texas Supreme
Court judges were influenced by large campaign contributions from
Houston lawyer Joe Jamail, who led the Pennzoil case.
   Although he was delighted to settle the case, Liedtke said the
outcome probably was not as good for Pennzoil as gaining Getty
would have been.
   ``I don't think that ($3 billion) in any way replaces totally
the loss the company has suffered. But it remains to be seen how
astutely these funds are reinvested and perhaps we can make up for
lost ground,'' he said.
   Attorney's fees, including Jamail's, come to about $400 million,
according to Pennzoil. Jamail declined to reveal his share.
   ``I'll spend (the money) on the important things like whiskey
and women,'' he said, smiling.
   Texaco officials had no comment on the payment.
   Pennzoil also announced Thursday that its board adopted a new
anti-takeover defense, a preferred stock purchase rights plan, to
replace a similar ``poison pill'' put in place after the jury made
its award.
   The old plan was designed to block a corporate raider from
appropriating the benefits of the Texaco case before it had been
resolved, Harper said.
   The new plan also was designed to protect Pennzoil from ``unfair
or coercive actions by opportunistic parties'' and give Pennzoil
time to make acquisitions using the Texaco money, Liedtke said.

<HEAD>Key Step In Activation Of AIDS Virus Discovered By Scientists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AIDS virus must make a precise
change in its protein coat before it can infect cells, and drugs
that can block that change might be able to prevent AIDS
infections, researchers say in a study published today.
   The researchers, from the Stanford University School of
Medicine, said they don't know whether such drugs could be
developed in a form that could make tham safe and effective for use
in humans.
   The scientists discovered that the AIDS virus, a piece of
genetic material housed in a complex envelope of fats and proteins,
can infect cells only if its outer envelope protein is clipped into
two pieces.
   If this cleavage doesn't occur, the virus particles assemble and
appear normal but are disarmed and unable to infect new cells, said
the leader of the study, Dr. Mike McCune, who works in the lab of
Dr. Irving Weissman, professor of pathology at Stanford's School of
Medicine. The results appear today in the journal Cell.
   The scientists demonstrated their findings by constructing a
mutant strain of the AIDS virus that could not complete the
critical step. They found it was unable to enter and infect human
cells in tissue culture.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome has struck 58,270 people
since June 1981, the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
reported this week. The disease has killed 32,545.
   The researchers believe the cleavage step is critical to the
virus' infectivity because it makes the virus' envelope protein
``sticky,'' which allows it to fuse to the membrane of a cell it
seeks to infect.
   After the virus has fused to the cell's membrane, it can enter
the cell and remain hidden from the body's immune system, reproduce
and eventually begin to spread infection throughout the body.
   The scientists believe that if they can prevent the AIDS virus
from sticking to cells, they might be able to suppress infection.
   The study was sponsored by grants from the National Cancer
Institute and the National Institutes of Health.

<HEAD>Death Penalty, Wiretap Bills Advance In Political Shenanigans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state Assembly has approved a bill
to allow the death penalty for people who kill children and set the
stage for a vote next week on a wiretap measure aimed at drug
dealers.
   Both votes were considered defeats for Speaker Willie Brown and
were led by minority Republicans and the so-called Gang of Five,
dissident Democrats opposed to Brown.
   The votes came during a five-hour floor session Thursday marked
by closed-door party caucuses, numerous small floor huddles and a
constant undercurrent of rumors that Brown might soon be ousted by
the 36 Republicans teaming with the Gang of Five. It takes 41 votes
to elect or remove a speaker in the 80-member Assembly.
   The two anti-crime bills had been stalled in the Public Safety
Committee.
   The death penalty bill was killed by that committee on March 21.
On Monday, Republicans and the Gang of Five combined to withdraw it
from committee, on a 41-30 vote, the first such successful
withdrawal motion in 28 years. Such motions are considered a
challenge to the authority of the speaker, who appoints committee
members.
   The bill would make child murder a special circumstance
qualifying a murderer for the death sentence, along with such other
specified crimes as murder of a police office or elected official,
or murder committed during a felony.
   The bill was approved 62-7 after a long and emotional debate and
sent to the Senate.
   The original wiretap bill was approved by the Senate last June
and has been in the Public Safety Committee since then.
   Supporters could not try to withdraw that bill because it hadn't
been rejected by the committee, so instead they took an unrelated
bill introduced by the same lawmaker, Sen. Robert Presley, that was
already on the floor and with his permission voted 48-13 to amend
it by adding the wiretap measure.
   The amended bill is scheduled for a floor vote next Thursday.
   The bill would allow police with approval of the attorney
general or a district attorney to petition a Superior Court for a
wiretap authorization. The police would have to show that it was
likely that a drug possession or sale offense had been or would be
committed.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police raided and seized a house where
crack was sold and operated it themselves for seven hours in a
sting operation in which 32 people were arrested, officers say.
   The arrests were a new strategy aimed at sowing fear among crack
users, said Capt. B. Ray Armand, head of the city police narcotic
squad.
   ``You always go after the top people selling the drugs, but now
we're attacking the demand factor,'' Armand said. ``We're probably
going to do this again. It was very successful.''
   During the operation Wednesday night and early Thursday,
officers were leading people they had arrested out the front door
of the house while new customers were coming in the back, he said.
   At times, officers said, people were lined up at the back door
and as many as six customer cars lined the curb while police
hurriedly packaged the crack form of cocaine in plastic bags.
   Several female customers left children, including one less than
a year old, in their cars while they went inside to purchase crack,
officers said.
   Officers said customers continued to enter the house even after
a woman reported on a citizens band radio that police had taken
over the house.
   ``We turned away twice as many (suspects) as we arrested,''
Armand said. ``They will go to any lengths to get drugs.''
   People were arrested on investigative charges of possession of a
controlled substance.

   An autopsy of an Israeli girl killed in a clash
with Palestinians found that she was struck in the head by a bullet
and a large object and cast doubts on army reports that Arabs
stoned her to death.
   Details provided by Israel television and radio raised the
possibility that 15-year-old Tirza Porat was shot accidentally by
one of the guards accompanying teen-age Jewish settlers on a
holiday hike in the West Bank.
   Two Arabs were killed and two were wounded in the incident
Wednesday in the village of Beita.
   Today, two Palestinians were shot and wounded in separate
clashes with troops in anti-occupation unrest in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials said.
   On Jerusalem's Temple Mount, several dozen Palestinians shouted
nationalist slogans after noon prayers on the Moslem Sabbath.
Demonstrators dispersed quickly after about 10 border policemen
approached.
   It remained unclear how Tirza was killed. The army first said
she and the two Arabs were shot to death. It later said Tirza was
stoned to death by villagers.
   An army official, citing autopsy results, then said Tirza was
struck in the head by both a bullet and a large object, possibly a
stone. The official said the cause of death was not yet known and
that investigators did not know from which weapon the bullet was
fired.
   Israel Television, quoting a military source, said the bullet
was fired from one of the two guards' M-16 rifles but that it
wasn't known who pulled the trigger. The source also was quoted as
saying that when Arabs wrested the guns away from the Israeli
guards, they probably were already empty.
   Israel radio quoted an army report as saying that Tirza also was
struck in the head by a rock hurled by the mother and sister of one
of the Arabs killed. The two women were arrested, the report said.
   The next day, the army blew up five homes of Beita Arabs
allegedly involved in the clash and rounded up hundreds of Arabs
for questioning. Soldiers fatally shot an Arab youth who the army
said ignored orders to stop.
   Tirza, the first Israeli civilian killed in four months of
unrest in the occupied territories, was buried near her home in the
West Bank settlement Elon Moreh. According to U.N. figures, 141
Arabs and one Israeli soldier have died.
   The girl's death increased tension between the 1.5 million
Palestinians and the 65,000 Jewish settlers living the territories
occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war.
   On Thursday, armed Israeli civilians beat residents, broke
windows and fired shots into the air in two villages near Beita.
   Israel radio, citing army investigators, said Wednesday's
violence began after a group of 16 teen-agers from Elon Moreh,
accompanied by two armed guards, were stoned by Arab youths as they
hiked near Beita.
   The two guards disagreed over what to do next, the radio report
said. One of the guards, Romam Al Dubi, 26, wanted to open fire,
but the second guard, Menachem Ilan, 55, asked him not to,
according to the report.
   Al Dubi then told the children to gather around him to serve as
a barrier, and started shooting, the radio report said. The Arab
youths eventually disarmed him and took the Israelis to Beita,
where they were attacked by villagers, the report said.
   Thirteen Israelis were wounded in the clash.
   Israeli media reports have identified Al Dubi as an extreme
religious nationalist and a follower of the anti-Arab Kach movement
of U.S. born Rabbi Meir Kahane.
   Last year, the army barred Al Dubi from entering the West Bank
city of Nablus for three months after he repeatedly sought
confrontations with Arabs over prayer rights at a site in the city,
which is holy to both Arabs and Jews.
   The army's West Bank commander, Maj. Gen. Armram Mitzna, told
Israel Television that ``hundreds'' of Beita villagers played a
role in Wednesday's clash.
   However, army officials also have said many villagers helped the
teen-agers, hiding some in their homes and calling ambulances.
   Beita remained under curfew as soldiers searched for residents,
many of whom had fled to nearby ravines and neighboring villages.
   Israel Television said the army distributed leaflets in the area
calling on Beita residents to surrender.

<HEAD>Second Magazine Calls Reporting Prize Unmerited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An executive of a second magazine has echoed a
complaint that this year's Pulitzer Prize to a Philadelphia
Inquirer reporter should be reconsidered because the winning entry
did not break new ground.
   Harper's magazine publisher John R. MacArthur said Thursday he
agreed with the contention of a Washington weekly, the National
Journal, that the series on secret Pentagon spending by Tim Weiner
leaned heavily on information another reporter published in the two
magazines.
   The formal complaint of the Journal will be discussed by the
executive committee of the Pulitzer board and some kind of judgment
should be made by next week, the board's secretary, Robert
Christopher, said.
   Christopher added that ``breaking new ground'' is not a
requirement for winning the national reporting prize.
   Richard Frank, editor of the National Journal, said in a letter
to the board that Weiner's series was built on an earlier story in
the Journal by David C. Morrison and ``plows no new journalistic
ground.''
   MacArthur said Weiner's stories were accompanied by an annotated
document similar to a feature Morrison did for the January 1987
issue of Harper's.
   ``It doesn't seem quite right that the Inquirer gets a Pulitzer
Prize unless originality has nothing to do with prize giving these
days,'' MacArthur said in a telephone call to The Associated Press.
He said he did not plan to write the Pulitzer board.
   Christopher said only he and the board chairman, David
Laventhol, had seen the complaint, but copies were being circulated
to the half dozen members of the executive committee.
   Laventhol, president of Times Mirror Co., which owns the
National Journal, said the magazine checked with him before
protesting.
   Laventhol said he told the Journal to go ahead if it felt
strongly about the issue. He said his acquiescence did not
necessarily mean he agreed with its position.
   Another board member, Eugene L. Roberts Jr., the Inquirer's
executive editor, said his only role in the review would be to
respond to the Journal's complaint and answer questions of other
board members.

   A gin and passion fruit concoction called the
Regal Flyer was the winning entry in a national contest to create a
cocktail in honor of the Duchess of York, the royal family's lively
new amateur pilot.
   Patricia Jones, a hotel bartender in the southern port city of
Southampton, created the cocktail, selected from hundreds of
entries from members of the United Kingdom Bartenders' Guild.
   The four judges selected the drink they believed best
represented ``all the vitality, humor and character'' of the
red-haired duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson.
   A statement by the guild said that 60 years ago a similar
contest was held to create a cocktail for the Duchess of York who
later became queen and now is Queen Mother Elizabeth.
   The current duchess, wife of Queen Elizabeth II's second son,
vowed before she married Prince Andrew in 1986 to win her pilot's
license ``to be a part of his life.'' Andrew is a helicopter pilot
with the Royal Navy.
   She now has licenses to fly helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.
   The Regal Flyer cocktail consists of one-tenth gin, one-tenth
grenadine, three-tenths passion fruit nectar, one-tenth egg white,
and four-tenths mineral water, topped with a lemon slice and
strawberry.

   Charles Merrill Mount is a man of contradictions.
Born and raised in Brooklyn, he has the accent and manners of a
British gentleman. A published biographer and Guggenheim Foundation
fellow, he wears natty suits from the Salvation Army.
   Perhaps the biggest contradiction, however, is whether he is a
scholarly collector of rare documents or a thief.
   Today a jury will be asked to decide if he is a scholarly
collector of rare documents or a thief. Closing arguments were
expected to be completed by midday, with jury deliberation to
follow.
   Mount is charged with interstate transportation of stolen goods,
letters and documents he allegedly stole from the Library of
Congress and the National Archives. The charge carries a possible
sentence of 10 years in prison and $500,000.
   Mount's friends say the charges are unbelievable. His lawyer
says they are unprovable.
   ``I don't think he could have done it psychologically,'' said
Gloucester artist John Manship, who testified for Mount during his
three-week trial. ``He has too much respect for history and
scholarship to steal from archives.''
   An engaging man with a sharp wit and piercing blue eyes, Mount
contends he has been reduced to poverty since the government seized
his savings. He was evicted from his Washington boarding house and
has stayed at a YMCA during the trial. The court rejected his pleas
for money to bring witnesses over from Ireland who he claims can
prove his ownership of the documents.
   ``I'm not allowed witnesses,'' he said. ``It's not a trial.''
   Mount is charged with selling a Boston bookshop letters written
by artist James McNeill Whistler, Winston Churchill and author
Henry James that belonged to the Library of Congress. He was
arrested while allegedly trying to sell letters and documents
signed by Abraham Lincoln and various Civil War generals that had
been taken from the National Archives.
   Mount has not been charged with theft, but Assistant U.S.
Attorney Martin Murphy said in the trial's opening arguments that
it is the government's contention that Mount took the papers.
   The prosecution presented testimony establishing that Mount had
access to the documents in May and July 1987.
   Mount testified he bought the Whistler papers at Paris shops in
the 50s and 60s and received the Civil War papers from an Irish
parish priest in 1961 who gave him the documents in a biscuit tin.
The priest has since died.
   The defense also has noted that Mount has over the years donated
many of his papers to the Library of Congress.
   ``Why would I steal from my own heirs?'' Mount asked.
   Charles McGinty, Mount's public defender, has attacked the
government's case as a ``shoddy arrest not justified by any kind of
investigative effort.''
   ``They never had definitive word from the institutions that the
letters were missing from their files,'' he said.
   The defense's case has largely rested on Mount's testimony and
the prosecution has raised questions about his background. At the
time of his arrest in August, the government revealed Mount was
born Sherman Suchow 59 years ago in Brooklyn and once was charged
with making false statements in a passport application.
   Mount freely admits he is ``a product of Brooklyn,'' and
attributes his accent to his Irish neighbors. His conviction on the
passport charge was reversed on appeal.
   Mount has been recognized for his work as an artist and writer.
He has written well-received biographies of painters John Singer
Sargent, Gilbert Stuart and Claude Monet. He received a Guggenheim
fellowship in 1956.
   But Mount frets his reputation has been destroyed by the case no
matter what the verdict.
   ``To be charged with something of a sleazy nature at this time
in my life, it's a disgrace,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A day after lawyers for Teamsters President
Jackie Presser challenged federal prosecutors to ``put up or shut
up,'' a potentially key witness for Presser's labor racketeering
and embezzlement trial entered a guilty plea.
   John A. ``Jack'' Nardi Jr., 46, appeared before U.S. District
Judge George W. White and pleaded guilty Thursday to being a
``ghost employee'' of Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland from 1972 to
1978. He was paid about $109,000 without doing any work for the
local, of which Presser was secretary-treasurer.
   The guilty pleas put in effect an agreement that requires Nardi
to testify as a government witness. The judge deferred sentencing
and said that Nardi's cooperation with government prosecutors would
be considered when sentencing eventually occurs.
   Nardi's plea came as Presser's lawyers were seeking to have
White dismiss all charges _ labor racketeering, embezzlement and
falsifying documents _ against the Teamsters boss.
   In documents filed with the court Wednesday, defense lawyers
alleged that an internal memo to former FBI Director William
Webster showed that Webster knew that Presser was authorized to
hire Nardi and others who did no work.
   Presser's role as an FBI informant has been confirmed repeatedly
in various legal proceedings.
   Presser's defense team stated: ``If authorization existed, then
no crime was committed ... but now when the proceedings have
reached the appropriate juncture for (prosecutors) to come forward
with its evidence and, in effect, `put up or shut up,' it fails to
`put up' anything.''
   Presser's trial is scheduled to begin July 12.

   An officer found guilty of racketeering and drug
charges in a cocaine-corruption scandal that rocked the Miami
police department has been sentenced to 35 years in prison and
fined $250,000.
   U.S. District Judge Kennth L. Ryskamp said Thursday that Osvaldo
Coello, 28, will have to serve at least 11 years before being
eligible for parole.
   Prosecutors said Coello belonged to a band of 15 corrupt
officers who stole drugs from smugglers and resold them.
   Coello was convicted Feb. 9 of racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy and two counts each of cocaine conspiracy and possession
with intent to distribute cocaine.
   He was acquitted of violating the civil rights of three men who
drowned in the Miami River during a raid on a drug boat.
   Coello was recaptured Oct. 5 in the Bahamas after he jumped bond
following a mistrial last year.

   Two West German relief workers held
captive by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants were freed when
rival Syrian-backed Shiite militiamen overran the militants' south
Lebanon stronghold, police said today.
   The pair, a man and a woman who worked for a West German
humanitarian organization identified as Asme Humanitas, disappeared
after leaving the Palestinian refugee camp of Mieh Mieh in Sidon
Wednesday morning, police said.
   They were released Thursday night, police said.
   They were identified as Heinrich Strubig, 47, the director of
the organization in Mieh Mieh, and his assistant, Petra Schnitzler,
24, of Hamburg.
   Police said they had been held in the basement of a mosque by
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the coastal town of
Ghaziyeh.
   Fighters of Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Amal militia released
them when they stormed Ghaziyeh after a four-day battle between the
rival factions for control of predomininantly Shiite south Lebanon.
   The Germans were taken from Ghaziyeh to the Hammoud Hospital in
Sidon, the provincial capital, this morning, police said.
   Doctors pronounced Trobig physically fit and quickly discharged
him, police said.
   But Ms. Schnitzler, who is diabetic and had several scratches on
her hands, was kept in the hospital for treatment, police added.
Doctors said she suffered bullet shrapnel cuts on one hand and
burns from another bullet that grazed her left wrist.
   Ms. Schnitzler, interviewed by a Sidon reporter, refused to say
whether she had been tortured in captivity.
   The abduction of the two West Germans had not been reported
before they were found.
   Ms. Schnitzler told The Associated Press that she and Strubig
were in an ambulance to distribute food and medicines when they
were stopped by armed men in at least two cars.
   The men fired several shots, forced the pair into a car and
drove them to the mosque.
   Strubig said the organization, based in Stadtoldendorf, began
providing social and medical assistance to Palestinian refugees and
poor Lebanese villagers in the Sidon region last November.
   Twenty-two foreigners, including nine Americans, are being held
captive in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East corresponsdent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Two men have been found guilty of
murdering a man who died four years after he was attacked and
robbed.
   Reginald Harding Jr., 24, and Christopher Bush, 30, were
convicted in separate trials by Oakland County Circuit Court juries.
   The victim of the 1983 attack, Jeffrey Dudley, 24, died last
summer. Assistant Prosecutor John Slevin argued Dudley's health
deteriorated steadily after the attack in which he was beaten, shot
in the heart and dumped in a sewer.
   Because of the attack, Dudley wore a pacemaker and underwent
surgery eight times. Doctors testified the attack caused permanent
heart damage.
   Dudley collapsed last June 28 after trying to stop a shoving
match between two players at a basketball game in Detroit. Bush's
lawyer, Otis Underwood, argued that a fall might have killed Dudley.
   Harding was convicted Thursday of felony murder. Bush was
convicted Wednesday of first-degree murder. They are both already
serving prison sentences for the robbery and assault.

<HEAD>Four Separate Flu Variations Floating Around U.S.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dominant type of flu this season has evolved
into four separate variations, complicating the task of developing
the proper vaccine for next winter, federal health officials say.
   Deaths from influenza and pneumonia have exceeded the Centers
for Disease Control's statistical ``epidemic threshold'' for the
past seven weeks. That figure is one indicator that the flu season
remains under way _ although the agency does not attempt to
tabulate the specific numbers of Americans dying from flu. Data is
collected from 121 cities but the CDC does not attempt to project a
national figure.
   Although the 1987-1988 flu season is winding down, some activity
continues, the CDC said. New York, Connecticut and New Hampshire
reported ``widespread'' flu outbreaks last week _ covering areas
including more than half the population.
   Eight other states _ Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Mexico,
North Dakota, Oregon, Vermont and Washington _ reported less severe
``regional'' outbreaks.
   The type A-H3N2 flu prevalent this season has long been
associated with ``excess mortality,'' the CDC said.
   Late last year, when the influenza season got under way, the CDC
saw evidence of an apparent ``drift'' in the type A-H3N2, one of
three major types of flu.
   The A-H3N2 virus, the CDC said at the time, was ``drifting''
away from the Leningrad flu, the A-H3N2 strain the 1987-1988 flu
vaccine was designed to stop, and toward a somewhat different form.
   The CDC said Thursday in its weekly report it has now identified
four different variants of A-H3N2 flu virus circulating in the
United States in recent months; they are known as the Sichuan flu,
the Victoria flu, the Sydney flu and the Shanghai flu.
   The 1987-88 vaccine did not protect patients against the various
A-H3N2 viruses ``as well as it could have against (the) Leningrad
(flu),'' said Suzanne Gaventa, a researcher with the influenza
branch.
   The four different viruses present a problem for immunization
experts, Ms. Gaventa said.
   The Atlanta-based CDC's Immunization Practices Advisory
Committee each year recommends which flu types the next winter's
vaccine should protect against, and which specific strains of those
types should be targeted. The reports of the four different A-H3N2
strains circulating this past winter ``will be used in deciding
which H3N2 antigen to use'' in next winter's vaccine, Ms. Gaventa
said.
   A flu vaccine can't protect optimally against four different flu
viruses belonging to the same type, she said. Instead, vaccine
experts will try to determine which virus to target, and how much
protection that vaccine might offer against closely related viruses.
   CDC recommends flu vaccine particularly for older people and
those who might be prone to severe complications from the flu.

   Poor indoor air quality caused by
energy-efficient heating, cooling and ventilation systems is a
serious health problem that may be aggravated by ignorance among
contractors, says an industry spokesman commenting on a study
released today.
   The study found that U.S. Army trainees housed in modern
barracks were about 50 percent more likely to contract a
respiratory infection during basic training than those who stayed
in older, better ventilated buildings.
   The study examined the incidence of influenza and other
respiratory illnesses among about 400,000 trainees at four U.S.
Army training centers from October 1982 to September 1986.
   The study says the findings may apply to office buildings and
other structures designed for maximum energy efficiency.
   ``In tight buildings with closed ventilation systems,
airborne-transmitted pathogens are not only recirculated and
concentrated but also efficiently dispersed through indoor living
spaces,'' the researchers wrote in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   By contrast, in `leaky'' older buildings, ``airborne-transmitted
agents are diluted by fresh, outdoor air and (are) relatively
quickly exhausted from indoor spaces,'' said the researchers from
the Walter Reed Army Insitute of Research in Washington.
   ``It is a serious problem, and there's a lot of talk about it
... but it doesn't seem like too many people are doing too many
things to correct it. Maybe it's because they don't know what to do
to correct it,'' said David Bevirt, director of research for the
Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors National Association
in Vienna, Va.
   ``As soon as you take in additional ventilation, you're losing
more energy ... and so it's a trade-off'' between energy efficiency
and air quality, he said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   Although there are modern ventilation systems that offer energy
efficiency as well as improved air quality, they tend to be more
expensive and many contractors may not know about them, Bevirt said.
   His association is putting together a manual for its members
worldwide that includes information on how to test air quality and
what can be done to maximize it while offering energy efficiency as
well, he said.
   Most office buildings and other structures built during the
energy-conscious 1970s feature tight insulation and ventilation
systems designed to keep outside air outside, Bevirt said.
   In such buildings, ``Up to 95 percent of the air in the building
is recirculated,'' exposing occupants to used air that may be
filled with viruses and other contaminants, said Paul Klein, a
spokesman for the Army institute.
   The Walter Reed study was not the first to examine the so-called
``sick building syndrome,'' but it covered a larger population over
a longer time period, Klein said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   The researchers, led by Dr. John F. Brundage, noted that
respiratory tract infections are the most common infectious
illnesses in adults. They said recent studies indicate that such
infections annually account for 75 million U.S. physician visits,
1.25 million hospitalizations, $15 billion in direct medical costs
and about 150 million lost work days.
   Klein said the Army is reviewing the study's results to see how
much the building-related illnesses cost and whether any changes
are needed in the design and construction of its buildings.

<HEAD>Landlord Moves To Evict Robert Chambers' Mother</HEAD>

   A landlord is seeking to evict the mother of the
young man who pleaded guilty in a Central Park sex killing from her
luxury apartment for non-payment of rent, according to court papers.
   The papers, filed Tuesday in Manhattan Civil Court, show that
the landlord, 11 East 99th Associates, claimed Mary P. Chambers had
not paid rent from August through February and owed $16,733.40,
which includes $100 in legal fees.
   Mrs. Chambers' son, Robert, 21, pleaded guilty on March 25 to
first-degree manslaughter in the strangulation death of 18-year-old
Jennifer Levin. His agreement to plead came while the jury was
deliberating over a verdict.
   The court papers showed Mrs. Chambers, 55, pays $2,376.20 a
month for her fifth-floor apartment on the upper East Side. There
was no indication of the size of the apartment.
   According to the court papers, Mrs. Chambers, a night nurse who
makes about $70,000 a year caring for an elderly wealthy patient,
was served with legal papers warning her that eviction proceedings
were under way.
   Meanwhile, she filed a $40,000 counterclaim Thursday, charging
that the apartment has not been properly maintained.
   The phone of her lawyer, David Rosenholc, went unanswered
Thursday. But in court papers responding to the landlord's
petition, he alleged his client had not been properly served with
the papers and that the rent had not been properly calculated.
   The landlord's attorney, Niles Welikson, could not be reached
for comment. His telephone was answered by a man who said Welikson
could not be reached.

<TEXT>
   The emerging agreement in Afghanistan would
send the Red Army home but may not stop the bloodshed in that
war-torn country.
   Under the United Nations-brokered deal, the Soviet Union could
continue arming the Kremlin-backed regime that seized power a
decade ago and the United States could continue arming the Moslem
guerrillas.
   Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his Afghan ally Najib
said jointly Thursday that ``the last obstacles to concluding the
agreements have now been removed'' and that Soviet troops can start
leaving on May 15 if the agreement is signed quickly.
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez later told reporters the agreement
is ``now finalized and open for signature.'' He said the signing
ceremony is expected to take place within a week.
   President Reagan was ``cautiously optimistic'' but ``wants to
see the fine print,'' said Howard Baker, White House chief of staff.
   Secretary George P. Shultz said today on CBS's ``This Morning''
that judging from public statements, ``perhaps ... what we
suggested will be agreeable to them, but we still want to see the
answer.''
   Privately, administration officials interpreted the
Soviet-Afghan statement as acceptance of U.S. conditions on aid.
   With the apparent resolution of the aid issue, Cordovez is
expected to turn his attention to a Pakistani demand for the
formation of an interim government during the Soviet withdrawal,
according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The composition of such a government would be settled outside
the United Nations talks by the Afghans themselves, according to
Cordovez, American officials and a dispatch by the official Soviet
news agency Tass.
   With no interim government, say the Pakistanis, civil war will
rage, preventing the return to Afghanistan of an estimated 3
million Afghan refugees driven into Pakistan and another 2 million
in Iran.
   Guerrilla leaders, and many U.S. government analysts, believe
the pro-Kremlin regime will collapse as the Red Army leaves. But
Najib and his Soviet allies believe the regime will survive.
   And the warring Afghan parties remain far apart over how to
govern their nation.
   The Soviet-Afghan communique urged formation of ``a coalition
government with the participation of all forces representing Afghan
society, including those who are currently opposed to one
another.'' And it urged a ``multi-party system,'' rather than
one-party rule patterned after the Soviet Union.
   The resistance has rejected Najib's calls for ``national
reconciliation.'' On Thursday, it announced the formation of a
government to rule over guerrilla-controlled territory and the head
of the resistance alliance, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, said the
guerrillas ``will try to intensify'' the war.
   ``No doubt, when the Russians leave Afghanistan, Najib's regime
will collapse,'' he said. ``To avoid anarchy and possible armed
clashes to seize power, it's necessary that all parties agree to a
temporary government'' in those parts of Afghanistan under
guerrilla control.
   Not all the leaders of the seven-party resistance agreed that
formation of a guerrilla government was a good idea. Ahmad Gailani
of the moderate National Islamic Front of Afghanistan said it could
cut the nation in half.
   ``If there are two governments in Afghanistan, there is the
danger of partition into north and south or east and west, as with
North and South Korea, or East and West Germany,'' he said,
advocating a transitional government in exile until the pro-Kremlin
regime is overthrown.
   One congressional source who closely follows events in
Afghanistan reached a similar conclusion, based on the formation of
a new province in northern Afghanistan, where the Soviets have
taken steps to fortify natural gas fields.
   The guerrillas also are split over whether Afghanistan should
have an Islamic or secular government.
   Yunis Khalis of the hardline Hezb-i-Islami faction said that
``colonialist countries, the superpowers _ East or West, American
or Russian _ have joined hands to prevent the creation of a total
Islamic government in Afghanistan.''
   Soviet analysts believe the pro-Kremlin government has a good
chance of surviving. The U.S. embassy in Kabul sent a cable to
Washington last September advising the Soviets that Najib's 110,000
troops in the army, police and secret police might be strong enough
to resist the guerrillas.
   A leading Soviet expert on Afghanistan, Yuri Gankovsky, said in
a lecture in Washington on Wednesday that ``the regime of the
People's Democratic Party may survive.''
   ``It is impossible to predict the future of Najib'' and his
colleagues, Gankovsky said. ``Their life is in the hands of the
almighty.''
   And Vladimir Semyonov, in a commentary distributed by the
semi-official Soviet news agency Novosti, said that Gorbachev and
Najib concluded that ``the policy of reconciliation has found a
broad response in the opposition, including the armed opposition.''
   U.S. government analysts scoff at the notion that a pro-Soviet
government will survive the Red Army withdrawal.
   The Soviets have been handing out passes to government officials
for safe exit from the country, according to a New York-based
organization called Freedom House which has ties to the resistance.
Western intelligence in Kabul has also reported that lists are
being drawn up for possible evacuation.
   And one administration observer of Afghan events, asked why
Gorbachev found it necessary to hold a surprise meeting with Najib
in the Soviet Central Asian city of Tashkent, said ``Najib must
have been demanding a bigger dacha than he had been allotted on the
Black Sea.''

   An attractive, inexperienced undercover
police officer entrapped John Zaccaro Jr. into selling her cocaine,
Zaccaro's lawyer told jurors today.
   Zaccaro, the son of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro, is on trial in Vermont District Court on allegations he
illegally sold a quarter-gram of cocaine to the officer two years
ago. Zaccaro was a senior at Middlebury College at the time.
   Charles Tetzlaff, Zaccaro's lawyer, told jurors in his opening
statement this morning that the defense doesn't dispute the sale,
but does challenge the police actions.
   ``The defense will not dispute the allegation that he sold a
regulated drug,'' Tetzlaff said. ``This is a case of improper and
overzealous police conduct.''
   Tetzlaff said ``an attractive female police officer'' who had
never before acted on an undercover assignment entrapped Zaccaro
into making the sale.
   John Quinn, the prosecutor, conceded in his opening arguments
that the undercover agent was inexperienced, but he asked jurors to
keep in mind that the Middlebury Police Department is a low-budget,
small-town operation.
   Quinn also urged jurors not to be swayed by Tetzlaff's attacks
on the police. ``I'd ask you to focus on what the charge is,'' he
said. ``Don't let anybody put anybody else on trial other than the
defendant.''
   Opening arguments came after four days of jury selection, a task
slowed by the wide publicity given the case and the celebrity
status of Ferraro.
   The jurors are being sequestered to help ensure they avoid press
accounts of the trial.
   The trial could last into Tuesday, said Quinn, adding that the
four days of jury selection was unusual for Vermont.
   ``Until this week, the longest I ever took to draw a jury was an
hour and a half,'' he said Thursday. ``It's unusual for a case to
get this kind of publicity.''
   Lawyers for both sides have questioned jurors on their feelings
about drugs, undercover police work and the prominence of Ferraro.
   Police said they began their investigation of Zaccaro, now 24,
after hearing he was dealing drugs. He is charged with selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to the undercover police officer in his
off-campus apartment.
   Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro Sr., have sat together
behind their son during the proceedings.
   Ferraro, a lawyer, took an active role during the questioning of
jurors. She has held in her lap the jurors' questionnaires and has
repeatedly written suggestions on index cards, which she tossed in
front of Tetzlaff during the questioning.

<DATELINE>NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal
militia held control of south Lebanon today after a four-day battle
with Iranian-backed rivals, police said.
   The fighting killed 62 people and wounded 150, police reported.
   Two West German relief workers who were being held by Hezbollah
members in the basement of a mosque in the coastal town of Ghaziyeh
were freed when Amal militiamen overran the town.
   They had been abducted Thursday, but their disappearance had not
been reported. They were identified as Heinrich Strubig, 47, and
Petra Schnitzler, 24, of the Asme Humanitas organization.
   The mainstream Amal, led by Justice Minister Nabih Berri, held
all major towns and villages in the south and their supply routes,
police said. Amal is Syria's closest ally in Lebanon.
   Diehard fighters of the Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah,
or Party of God, were holed up in three hamlets west of the market
town of Nabatiyeh with Shiite mediators negotiating terms for their
surrender and safe conduct, police said.
   Amal's triumph reflected Syria's determination to crush a
growing challenge by Iran to its role as the main power broker in
Lebanon.
   Syria is Iran's main Arab ally in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulf
war against Iraq.
   But it has been alarmed at Hezbollah's widening influence and
its efforts to seize control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the
country's largest sect.
   Police said that one of the hamlets where Hezbollah was still
holding out was Jibsheet, its main stronghold in the south.
Jibsheet is 15 miles southwest of the provincial capital of Sidon.
   Amal fighters surrounded it, along with neighboring Sharkieh and
Houmin al-Fouka, police said. Berri's fighters were expected to
occupy the villages once Hezbollah evacuated them.
   Friction between the secular leftist Amal and the fundamentalist
Hezbollah, which seeks to create an Iranian-style Islamic republic
in Lebanon, has sharpened since the kidnapping of U.S. Marine Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins.
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was kidnapped near the ancient
port of Tyre Feb. 17 while serving with a U.N. observer group in
south Lebanon.
   An underground Shiite extremist group calling itself the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed responsibility.
   Amal accused Hezbollah of being behind the abduction and rounded
up several Hezbollah members it said were involved in the
kidnapping. But a major dragnet failed to locate Higgins or his
captors.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for several Shiite
factions holding many of the other 21 foreigners missing in
Lebanon. Nine of the hostages are American.

   Jesse Jackson said today he has ``sent a message
no one can miss'' to Jewish voters troubled by his past actions
while a New York Democratic official said he sees ``a clear sense
of some movement'' by the state's party hierarchy toward Michael
Dukakis.
   Jackson, Dukakis and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. canvassed New York
City in search of votes in the April 19 primary, which will decide
the breakdown of 255 delegates.
   In Manhattan, Jackson would not say whether he has agreed to
meet with Jewish leaders to talk over his 1984 reference to New
York City as ``Hymietown'' or his call for a Palestinian homeland,
but he said, ``We continue to build relationships, we continue to
heal relationships.''
   He said that he has reached out to all ethnic groups, including
Jews. ``Our own commitment is to end any vestiges of racism, of
anti-Semitism, or sexism. ... We've sent a message no one can
miss,'' he said.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and state party chairman Laurence
Kirwan sent a signal to other Democratic officials to line up
behind one of the three Democrats in the race, and not await an
endorsement from the governor. Gore and Jackson picked up some
support, but party executive director John Marino said he thought
the Massachusetts governor was the beneficiary.
   ``After yesterday, I got a clear sense of some movement to
Dukakis,'' Marino said today.
   A poll released today said Dukakis was the choice of 47 percent
of likely Democratic voters, while 31 percent backed Jackson. Gore
was the choice of 6 percent.
   The Marist College Institute for Public Opinion questioned 404
Democrats Tuesday and Wednesday for the survey which had a margin
of error of 5 percentage points. A similar survey conducted by the
institute in mid-March had Dukakis the choice of 37 percent of
Democrats and Jackson the pick of 28 percent.
   A fourth Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Paul Simon of
Illinois, put his campaign in cold storage on Thursday _ and drew
sharp criticism from Jackson for technically remaining in the race
to keep control of the block of 47 at-large delegates he will get
as a result of his Illinois primary victory.
   If Simon dropped out, those delegates would go to Jackson, who
finished second in Illinois.
   ``I would hope that in time Mr. Simon ... now that he has made
the decision to leave the race will leave so honorably, and hide
behind no technicalities to block those as my delegates which in
fact belong to me,'' said Jackson.
   Vice President George Bush, considered a sure bet for the
Republican presidential nomination even by his only remaining
rival, Pat Robertson, was heading for Texas to wind up the
fund-raising phase of his campaign.
   Robertson, who has said he will not campaign in New York,
dropped his Secret Service protection on Thursday but an aide said
the former television evangelist would remain an active candidate
up to the GOP convention in New Orleans in August.
   Barbara Gattullo said Robertson hoped to bring ``a strong
conservative message'' to the convention.
   The Democratic candidates crossed paths often in New York,
appearing at forums sponsored by the state party and The Democracy
Project, a liberal-oriented group.
   They often found it difficult to escape the shadows of Gov.
Mario Cuomo and New York City Mayor Ed Koch.
   ``Who cares what ... Mario Cuomo says?'' responded Cuomo when
pressed about whether he would endorse one of the contenders.
   Cuomo also has advised Gore to tone down criticism of his rivals
_ a request seconded by party chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr.
   ``I spoke a year ago about the importance of resolving to keep
the debate and the dialogue positive and not involved in any
negative campaigning,'' Kirk said.
   ``For the most part, we've been quite successful in that regard.
The admonitions that have been addressed to Sen. Gore by Gov. Cuomo
just help to make sure we can continue to talk about the issues in
a positive way.''
   No sooner had Kirk and Cuomo spoken than Gore let loose with a
fresh attack. He accused the Dukakis campaign of trying to fuel a
``stop Jackson'' movement by spreading the word that ``a vote for
Gore is a vote for Jackson.''
   The Dukakis campaign denied that, and Jackson's campaign
manager, Gerald Austin, said Gore has used that strategy himself.
   Asked if he would persist in his attacks, Gore said, ``I think
there is a legitimate role for drawing a contrast between one's
approach to the issues, one's experience, one's philosophy of
government and those of one's opponents.''
   Koch also was unwilling to heed the admonitions of the governor
and party chairman and said Jews would have to be ``crazy'' to vote
for Jackson because of his views on Israel.
   Jackson brushed aside the remark, saying ``Let us keep this
campaign above any form of racial or religious bigotry.''
   Jackson came under strong criticism in 1984 for his relationship
with Louis Farrakhan, leader of the National of Islam, a Black
Muslim group. Fahrakahn once described Judaism as a ``gutter
religion.''
   Asked what his relationship now is with Farrakhan, Jackson said,
``We do not have one. It is precisely that.''

   The mayor, two state legislators and 13
other Mingo County political figures indicted by a grand jury used
bribes and illegal contributions to ``subvert the free election
system,'' a prosecutor said.
   The state indictments Thursday followed federal indictments
charging a police chief, a former fire chief and their families
with openly running a drug ring protected by a web of bribes in the
mountain coal-mining county.
   One state indictment charged state Sen. Truman Chafin with
accepting a bribe in 1982 when he was a county commissioner to
assist in the sale of the sheriff's job for $100,000.
   Another indictment accused 15 others of violating state election
laws and conspiracy. They are accused of conspiring with Johnie M.
Owens, the former sheriff and former county Democratic Party
chairman, and others to influence elections in 1984 and 1986 and
county law enforcement.
   ``The indictment charges this group of people with attempting
basically to subvert the free election system in Mingo County in
numerous different acts and actions,'' Special Prosecutor James
Colburn said.
   ``They conspired ... by illegal campaign contributions, by
illegal campaign expenditures, by bribery, by false accounting, and
by conspiring to do all these things,'' he said.
   Colburn emphasized that the indictments were a warning to other
politicians who might use political slates to further their
positions. ``I believe that if one reviews the statutes, one can
see a lot of slate activity violates West Virginia law,'' Colburn
said.
   Among those named in a 10-count indictment were state Sen. John
Pat Fanning, county Prosecutor W. Thomas Ward, Williamson Mayor Sam
Kapourales, and County Commissioners Steve Adkins and Ronald Rumora.
   The indictment alleges they ``associated together with Johnie M.
Owens and others to improperly affect and influence the free
election system and the law enforcement system of Mingo County.''
   The indictment lists five felonies and five misdemeanors, but
some counts do not apply to all defendants.
   Also named as defendants were Mingo County county school board
members Paul Sizemore and Robert Simpkins, former state Delegates
James B. Simpkins, Irvine K.O. Damron, and R. Doyle Van Meter II,
former county Magistrate Joey Kohari, Magistrate Bill Webb, former
Circuit Clerk Robert J. ``Jack'' Webb, former County Clerk Hugh
Wellman, and Larry Hamrick, a former school board member.
   Also indicted was Goodwill Motors Inc., a used car dealership at
Delbarton owned by former county commissioner and former county
Democratic Chairman Stewart Justice. Justice was not named as a
defendant.
   The defendants are scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in county
Circuit Court.
   Some defendants said they were surprised by the indictment,
which was the result of several investigations spanning more than
two years. ``I've tried all my life to live a decent life, and
something like this is quite a shock,'' Robert Simpkins said.
   Chafin denied any wrongdoing.
   ``As I have said time and time again, I had nothing to do with
any sale of the Mingo County sheriff's office,'' he said. ``I
received no money or benefit as a result of this transaction. ...
This matter will be finally resolved in a court of law. Until then
I have no further comment.''
   Ward was not at his office and could not be reached for comment,
and Kapourales refused to comment when contacted by telephone
Thursday. Fanning was at neither his home nor his office today.
   Hamrick, who is awaiting sentencing after admitting to felonies
involving the misuse of county funds, eferred all questions to his
lawyers.
   ``I can't make any comment,'' Hamrick said. ``I'm in federal
custody.''
   Kohari said he had not seen a copy of the indictment, but added,
``I have nothing to be ashamed of.''
   The federal grand jury indicted several current and former
officials in the alleged sale of the sheriff's office to current
Sheriff Charles ``Eddie'' Hilbert in 1982.
   The joint federal-state probe began two years ago when
investigators discovered drugs being sold so freely in Kermit, a
Mingo County town of 700, that undercover officers were able to
photograph a ``No Drugs Today'' sign posted outside a trailer.
   So far, the investigation has netted more than 50 convictions or
guilty pleas, with no acquittals.
   Hilbert was indicted in January on 13 felony counts, including
charges that he helped protect a drug ring operated by then-Kermit
Fire Chief Wilburn ``Wig'' Preece and Preece's family.
   Among those serving sentences of up to 16 years for operating
the ring are Preece; his wife, Virginia; their son-in-law, former
Police Chief David Ramey; and their four sons and two of their
daughters. A third daughter was placed on probation.
   Owens and former Commissioner Rastie Runyon have pleaded guilty
and will be sentenced April 18, the same day Hilbert is scheduled
to enter a plea as part of an agreement with prosecutors. Adkins is
awaiting trial.

   Attorneys for John Demjanjuk filed court papers
today to have the retired autoworker's U.S. citizenship restored,
more than a week before a panel of Israeli judges is to announce
its verdict in Demjanjuk's yearlong war crimes trial.
   The papers also claim that the U.S. Justice Department
suppressed information from witnesses that would have helped
Demjanjuk substantiate his claim of mistaken identify.
   Demjanjuk was stripped of his citizenship in 1981, when a U.S.
District Court judge ruled that he lied on his immigration papers
to cover up his past. Demjanjuk, 68, was extradited to Israel more
than two years ago to stand trial. A three-judge panel heard
evidence about whether he was the death camp guard called Ivan the
Terrible, who ran the Treblinka gas chambers in Nazi-occupied
Poland in 1942 and 1943. An estimated 850,000 Jews were murdered at
Treblinka during the period.
   Demjanjuk, who lived in a Cleveland suburb, claims he is the
victim of mistaken identity. The Israeli judges are expected to
render a verdict April 18.
   In the documents, Demjanjuk's attorneys ask that the order
stripping him of his U.S. citizenship be overturned. Demjanjuk, a
Ukrainian, became a U.S. citizen in 1952.
   Demjanjuk has said he was drafted into the Soviet Army, captured
by the Germans and was a prisoner of war for the remainder of the
war.
   Ed Nishnic, Demjanjuk's son-in-law, said his family has
anonymously received documents belonging to the Justice
Department's Office of Special Investigations, which prosecuted
Demjanjuk's denaturalization trial.
   ``We've acquired documents through unknown sources that really
lay out, plain and clear, what OSI's intentions were from the
beginning. That they did not believe Mr. Demjanjuk was in fact Ivan
the Terrible and they went ahead and prosecuted him and suppressed
the evidence that would help him prove his case,'' Nishnic said
today outside the courthouse.
   The OSI materials were received in 1986 and 1987, according to
the court documents. The family claims there were many more
witnesses than represented by the United States and that those
witnesses likely to know Ivan the Terrible's identify could not
make an identification of Demjanjuk.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev today confirmed
that Soviet troops will begin leaving Afghanistan on May 15 but
said it was not a present to President Reagan, Radio Moscow
reported.
   The broadcast said Gorbachev made the declaration during an
address to Communist Party officials in the Soviet city of
Tashkent, where he met Thursday with Afghan leader Najib.
   ``At the same time, the Soviet leader said the withdrawal of the
troops should not be regarded as a sort of present to President
Reagan on the eve of his visit to the USSR,'' Radio Moscow said.
   Reagan plans to visit Moscow from May 29 to June 2 for his
fourth summit with Gorbachev.
   Radio Moscow also broadcast the news that an agreement to end
the Afghan war had been completed in Geneva and was ready to be
signed.
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez said in Geneva that a signing
ceremony is expected to take place Thursday.
   Gorbachev and Najib announced after their Taskkent meeting that
all obstacles to a peace agreement had been removed. Gorbachev said
then that the Soviet Union's troops could start leaving on May 15
if the Geneva accords were signed soon.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979. An estimated
115,000 are helping the Marxist government fight Moslem insurgents.
Pakistan has been representing the guerrillas at the Geneva talks.
   The official Tass news agency issued an urgent report shortly
after Cordovez' announcement that the Afghan and Pakistani
representatives had said they were prepared to sign the accord.
   Tass quoted Cordovez as saying the composition of the Afghan
leadership in Kabul was a matter to be determined by the Afghans
themselves.
   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan have objected repeatedly to
Pakistan's insistence that arrangements for a transitional
government in Afghanistan be worked out before a Geneva accord is
signed.
   An earlier Tass dispatch quoted Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul
Wakil and his Pakistani counterpart, Zain Noorani, as saying in
Geneva the accords were ready for signature.
   The major Soviet newspapers today carried pictures of Gorbachev
and Najib meeting in the Central Asian city of Tashkent, along with
a text of their joint statement.

   Raman Raghav, a psychopathic murderer who
confessed to killing 42 people with an iron bar in a 1962-68 spree,
has died of a kidney ailment after nearly 20 years in prison,
police said Friday.
   Raghav, 63, died Thursday in a hospital in Poona, 77 miles
southeast of Bombay.
   He had been in Yervada Jail in Poona since 1968 when he was
found mentally deranged and unfit to stand trial. He spent 16 years
in solitary confinement.
   Police Inspector Keshav Sahasrabuddhe, who helped track down
Raghav before his arrest in August 1968, said Raghav killed most of
his victims while they slept, hitting them with a bent iron bar.
   ``He used to hit his victims with the weapon in the temple near
the ear, causing instantaneous death,'' the inspector said, adding
that three of the victims were women and one was a 6-month-old baby.
   The United News of India said Raghav confessed to 42 murders
before a magistrate in Bombay. The slayings in Bombay and its
suburbs set off widespread fear and panic.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
headed for home Friday without a breakthrough on Mideast peace
talks, but he vowed to find the time to try again ``and struggle
against the odds.''
   En route, Shultz made a surprise stop in Cyprus to make some
headway on a new power-sharing arrangement in battered Lebanon.
   A U.S. Army helicopter flew Lebanese President Amin Gemayal from
Beirut to meet with Shultz. A senior U.S. official said Gemayal was
willing to consider Syrian demands to dilute the powers of his
office, which traditionally is reserved for a Maronite Christian.
   Shultz worked out the terms with Syrian President Hafez Assad in
Damascus on Tuesday. The Syrian leader did not offer to withdraw
his army from Lebanon, but the United States is hoping that could
occur if the country, torn by civil war for 12 years, is stabilized.
   Shultz cautioned reporters in an airborne news conference not to
assume the surge of Lebanon diplomacy ``means some big new
development in Lebanon or on the hostages.''
   Nine Americans are being held hostage in Lebanon by groups that
U.S. terrorism experts believe are controlled by Iran.
   In acknowledging only ``inches'' of progress over six days in
the Middle East, Shultz did not assign blame to Israel or Jordan,
the key parties who did not accept his proposals. And he said he
was not discouraged.
   ``Whether you are discouraged or not has to do with your
expectations of what might happen,'' he said. ``If you have the
expectation everything all of a sudden is going to fall into place
you'd be discouraged, but I am not that naive to think the
difficult problems fall away.''
   In fact, Shultz said, ``I think we've probably gotten a little
further than I expected we might. So we'll keep at it. And I will
find time, as time goes along, to come back and work at it myself.''
   After several days of praising King Hussein of Jordan for taking
a ``constructive' approach to a U.S. plan for negotiations and
implying Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir had not, Shultz
said: ``The Israelis are as interested in peace and stability as
Jordan and the Palestinians, perhaps even more so.''
   He said both Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres had urged
him to keep at it, although Shamir still has ``reservations'' about
a Middle East peace conference.
   Shultz had hoped such a meeting could be called in mid-April,
but he acknowledged that obviously was now impossible. He said he
had not altered the ``time line'' of his proposal, however. It
calls for a conference attended by the United States, the Soviet
Union, China, Britain and France to launch negotiations shortly
afterward on Palestinian self-rule.
   The talks would be held between Israel and a mixed delegation of
Jordan and Palestinians, approved by the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The self-rule would give Palestinians on the Israeli-held West
Bank and Gaza control over their daily lives, but not over security
or foreign affairs for three years. Meantime, wider negotiations on
an overall settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute would begin seven
months after the opening of the first stage of the talks.
   ``There's a big need, and a very explosive kind of area,''
Shultz said of his determination to hold negotiations before the
Reagan administration leaves office next January. ``So it's worth
swimming upstream under the circumstances.''
   Earlier, at a news conference in Amman, Jordan, his last shuttle
stop, Shultz dismissed a reporter's suggestion his mission was
doomed to failure.
   ``Who's afraid to struggle against odds?,'' he said. ``You have
to be willing to do it. What am I saving myself for anyway?
   ``I've a few more months to go here and I want to try to leave
something constructive for the region and for my successors, so I
am going to put my back into it. Why not?''

   The acquittal of 13 white supremacists
on sedition charges means that ``religious freedom is still alive
in this country,'' says one of the defendants in the seven-week
federal trial.
   An all-white jury Thursday acquitted the men of charges
including conspiring to kill a federal judge and FBI agent and
plotting to overthrow the federal government and establish an
all-white nation in the Pacific Northwest.
   Afterward, one juror said jury members didn't believe the
government's witnesses. Two spokesmen for national human rights
organizations said the acquittals marked a setback for those
fighting bigotry and racism.
   Defendant Robert E. Miles, 63, a white supremacist leader from
Cohoctah, Mich., praised the verdicts. But when asked how the trial
had affected the supremacist movement, he said, ``Who knows? What
movement? What's left of it after this?''
   ``This proves that the common law is still alive,'' said
defendant Richard G. Butler of Hayden Lake, Idaho. ``This means we
still enjoy the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of
association and freedom of religion.''
   The government presented 113 witnesses during the trial, which
began Feb. 16. Prosecutors sought to prove that supremacists robbed
banks and armored trucks of $4.1 million to finance their
activities, including about $1 million still missing. The jury
deliberated four days.
   The defense, which called 79 witnesses, contended the conspiracy
theory was made up by a key government witness, James Ellison, 47,
who led a supremacist group in Arkansas and is serving 20 years for
racketeering.
   To discredit Ellison, the defense disclosed he had two wives,
thought he received messages from God and had himself crowned King
James of the Ozarks.
   One juror, who asked not to be identified summed up the case by
saying, ``We just didn't believe the government's witnesses.''
   Asked if the jury put much stock in Ellison's testimony, the
juror asked, ``Would you?'' The juror said Ellison and other
witnesses who backed him ``stood to gain with reduced sentences by
testifying for the government.''
   Defendants said the government was trying to suppress their call
for white separatism and other aspects of their political and
religious views.
   ``Religious freedom is still alive in this country,'' said Miles.
   But U.S. Attorney J. Michael Fitzhugh denied that the charges
were politically motivated.
   ``We weren't after them because of what they believed or what
they said,'' he said. ``We were after them because of what they
did.''
   Fitzhugh said today on CBS' ``This Morning'':``I don't think
that there's anything that we would have done any differently,
either with the charges that we did or the way that we presented
the case. We thought we had a good, prosecutable, winnable case and
it just didn't turn out that way.''
   Defendant Louis Ray Beam Jr., 41, of Houston, celebrated his
acquittal by standing in the shadow of a Confederate memorial
opposite the court building and claiming victory against what he
calls the Zionist Occupation Government.
   ``I think ZOG has suffered a terrible defeat here today,'' Beam
said. ``I think everyone saw through the charade and saw that I was
simply being punished for being a vociferous and outspoken opponent
of ZOG.''
   Burton Levinson, national chairman of the Anti-Defamation
League, called the verdicts ``a real setback in the war against
organized hate.''
   ``Although many of the defendants are already serving prison
terms growing out of their extremist activities, the others,
including the most important leaders, will now be free to once
again promote their anti-democratic and bigoted aims,'' Levinson
said in a statement from New York. ``The outcome means that we must
and will remain vigilant.''
   The acquittal of the white supremacists was cited by Urban
League National President John Jacobs as another example of the
resurgence of racism in the United States.
   ``Every time something like this happens, it sets back the whole
movement for fairness, equality and justice,'' Jacobs said Thursday
night in Grand Rapids, Mich. ``You can be a racist and get away
with it, and that is a very disturbing message.''
   Besides Miles, Butler and Beam, the other defendants were:
   _Richard Joseph Scutari, 40, of New York, already serving 60
years for racketeering.
   _Bruce Carroll Pierce, 32, of Metalline Falls, Wash., serving
100 years for racketeering and 150 years for violating the civil
rights of Denver radio personality Alan Berg by killing him.
   _Andrew Virgil Barnhill, 31, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., serving
40 years for racketeering.
   _Ardie McBrearty, 60, of Gentry, Ark., serving 40 years for
racketeering.
   _David Eden Lane, 48, of Denver, serving 40 years for
racketeering and 150 years for Berg's death.
   _Richard Wayne Snell, 57, of Muse, Okla., sentenced to die for
the murder of a pawn shop operator in 1983 and life in prison
without parole for the 1984 slaying of an Arkansas state trooper.
   _Lambert Miller, 47, of Springfield, Mo.
   _David Michael McGuire, 25, of Greenville, Ill.
   _Ivan Ray Wade, 35, of Smithville, Ark.
   _William Wade, 68, of Smithville, father of Ivan Ray Wade.
   Miles, Butler, Beam, Scutari, Pierce, Barnhill, McBrearty, Lane
and Snell were acquitted of charges of seditious conspiracy;
Scutari and Barnhill were acquitted of transporting stolen money,
and Snell, Miller, McGuire and the Wades were acquitted of
conspiracy to commit murder.
   A fourteenth defendant, Robert Neil Smalley, 32, of Fort Smith,
was acquitted earlier in the trial.

   The courtship between an American teacher and
her Soviet fiance, who has been in this country two weeks, has
spanned most of her adult life, but she's still hesitant about
marriage.
   Victor Novikov, 56, met Elizabeth Condon, 45, 21 years ago when
she was a tour guide for the U.S. Information Agency in Moscow.
   They planned to marry in 1979, until Soviet authorities stood in
the way, and Novikov has considered himself married ever since.
   But Ms. Condon hesitates when asked if the two will marry before
Novikov's visa expires.
   ``We're very pleased with the way things are going,'' Ms. Condon
said. ``I just want us to get re-acquainted a little bit, at least
have two months to think about it.''
   ``America has exceeded my expectations,'' Novikov, speaking
through an interpreter, said last week while sitting on the steps
of Ms. Condon's home, where she has lived with her mother since she
was 10.
   ``I want to say sincerely that I am in ecstasy,'' he said.
   Novikov arrived for his visit March 26, and Ms. Condon met him
at New York's Kennedy Airport.
   ``I recognized him right away, but he was wearing this horrible
hat, this soft men's type hat,'' she said. ``The first thing I did
was take the hat off.''
   Novikov said he never married after meeting Ms. Condon because
he always felt committed to her.
   ``He always insisted that everyone call me his wife,'' she said.
``For him, coming here is more like a technicality, like filling
out a form. He already feels he's married.''
   Novikov is planning to take English lessons and hopes to resume
work as a research chemist in the United States.
   But if they do not marry within three months, he must return to
the Soviet Union.
   ``I have confidence, but it depends on Elizabeth,'' he said.
``As they say in Russian, every week has seven Fridays.''
   He meant, said Ms. Condon, ``that I'm a lot more up and down
about this than he is.''
   But ups and downs have been a hallmark of their relationship.
   After they met in Moscow, they kept in touch by mail.
   During a 10-week visit in the summer of 1970, when Ms. Condon
was studying at Moscow University, Novikov proposed marriage but
she refused.
   On another 10-week Moscow visit in 1979, they decided to get
married that October.
   Their wedding was canceled when Soviet officials said they had
received an anonymous letter claiming Novikov was already married.
That claim was false, Ms. Condon said, but other bureaucratic
obstacles prevented the marriage.
   Novikov lost his job as a chemist in 1982 after announcing he
wanted to emigrate to the United States, and has since supported
himself with menial jobs.
   ``There were many difficult days and much was lost,'' said
Novikov. ``Time itself was lost.''

<HEAD>Stamp Sales Swamp Some Post Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shortages of 3-cent stamps are being reported
at some post offices, but depleted inventories are being rapidly
refilled, the U.S. Postal Service reported Friday.
   ``The stamps are out there, but some offices have a lot more
than others,'' spokeswoman Tanya Perkins said.
   More than 1 billion 3-cent stamps were sent to local post
offices in preparation for the rate change, from 22 cents to 25
cents, last Sunday, Perkins said.
   And another 600 million of the 3-cent stamps are in warehouses,
being used to replenish stocks where needed, she said.
   ``We had asked local offices to predict how many they would
need, and some had a lot more demand than expected. We've been
filling orders all week,'' Perkins said.
   Sales of coils of 100 of the stamps have been especially heavy,
she said, rather than people buying just a few stamps to tide them
over.
   On the other hand, Perkins said plenty of the undenominated
``E'' stamps remain available. Some 6 billion E-stamps, which
represent the new 25-cent rate, have been shipped to post offices.
   Apparently, Perkins said, people are choosing to buy 3-cent
stamps in order to use up the 22-cent stamps they had on hand,
before buying the new higher rate stamps.
   Perkins said that the stamp shortages are scattered across the
country, rather than being confined to any particular area.
   Most offices also have 1-cent and 2-cent stanps available, she
added, and stamps can also be purchased by mail and telephone.

   Three people who spent more than $5,000 in 10
minutes at Neiman-Marcus were arrested in a $500,000 heist of an
armored car, police said.
   The two men and a woman, all in their 30s, were arrested
Thursday shortly after the Neiman-Marcus manager noticed them
buying gold jewelry, clothing and shoes with cash.
   The manager notified police because the three were dressed in
jeans, old shirts and tennis shoes, police said. Authorities
recovered all but about $10,000 of the estimated $500,000 taken
Wednesday from an armored car by two men wearing ski masks and
armed with a shotgun and a pistol.
   Police arrested the three suspects on a downtown street and
found the money in bags next to the Neiman-Marcus merchandise in
the trunk of their car.
   No charges have yet been filed, police said Friday.

   Co-workers dug frantically with their
hands, helmets and shovels to save a man buried when underground
walls suddenly gave way, covering him with two tons of dirt,
officials said.
   Pete Schillaci, 33, was in fair condition Friday at Oregon
Health Sciences University Hospital.
   He had been hooking up an underground sewer line when the
accident occurred Thursday. He was underground for less than 20
minutes.
   ``Everything was looking good, and then with absolutely no
warning two tons ... came down on us,'' said Jerry Kuhn, himself
mired to the waist.
   Kuhn pulled himself from the hole and, together with backhoe
operator Paul Thompson, began scooping at the earth.
   After about four minutes, Kuhn said, they uncovered Schillaci's
face.
   The men followed procedures they had learned in a
cardiopulmonary resuscitation class at work. When emergency crews
arrived, Schillaci was turning blue from lack of oxygen and blood
was trickling from his mouth, said firefighter Brice Brinkhead.

   No punitive action was planned and no
charges were filed against a hospital where a man died after he was
injected with the wrong drug while undergoing kidney dialysis,
officials said.
   Angelo Carillo, 68, died Wednesday at Our Lady Of Lourdes
Medical Center in Camden. He and two other elderly patients went
into cardiac arrest after a technician accidentally injected them
Wednesday with the wrong drug, authorities said.
   Investigations by the state Department of Health and Camden
County Prosecutor Samuel Asbell show that a technician accidently
gave the patients an injection of the painkiller lidocaine instead
of mannitol, which regulates blood pressure.
   The other two patients, a man and a woman, were revived and were
in stable condition, hospital officials said.
   ``There's no criminality. It's a mistake. It's considered
accidental,'' George Kerns, a spokesman for Asbell's office, said
Thursday.
   State Department of Health spokeswoman Marilyn Riley said no
punitive action by the department was planned.
   She said an initial report by a team of nurses from the health
department said three certified kidney technicians working under a
supervising nurse were involved.
   She said a bottle of lidocaine was incorrectly placed on a shelf
where mannitol is stored. The technicians removed the lidocaine
from the shelf without looking at the label and injected the
patients, Ms. Riley said.
   Lidocaine is used in kidney dialysis as an anesthestic to numb
the area where a large needle is inserted, while mannitol is used
to stimulate kidney functions, Ms. Riley said.
   She said the kidney center staff has removed all lidocaine from
the dialysis area and will use a topical anesthetic in its place.
   Kidney dialysis machines purify a patient's blood if the kidneys
don't function. The center has given 300,000 treatments since
opening in 1969, officials said.

<HEAD>Baker Hints At New Sanctions Against Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House chief of staff Howard
Baker today hinted the United States is preparing to announce new
economic sanctions against Panama to force the ouster of military
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Administration sources, requesting anonymity, said the most
likely prospect was that the administration would invoke an
emergency law to forbid American companies, subsidiaries and
individuals from paying taxes, fees or other payments to Panama.
   The United States has been trying to get American firms to
withhold the payments voluntarily.
   The law, known as the International Emergency Economic Powers
Authority, has been used before against other countries, including
Iran and Libya.
   Baker, briefing reporters at a seaside hotel during Reagan's
10-day vacation, said sanctions already imposed by the United
States have had a ``remarkable success'' as the United States tries
to convince Noriega that he should leave.
   ``What happens next is a matter that the president will address
and will address promptly, perhaps even today, on what other steps
are to be taken,'' Baker said.

   A woman was sentenced to 12 to 46 months
in jail for the deaths of her two children, who were locked in a
hot car for five hours last August.
   Washington County Judge John Bell on Thursday sentenced Lisa
Shields, 20, of Indiana. She pleaded guilty March 1 to two counts
of endangering the welfare of children.
   Her husband, John Shields, 23, has yet to be sentenced. He
pleaded guilty to two counts of involuntary manslaughter.
   The parents' separate trials were moved out of Indiana County
because of widespread publicity about the case.
   Calvin Shields, 1, and his sister, Kristle, 3, died of heat
exposure, authorities said. They were locked in the car from
morning until early afternoon on a hot, partly sunny day while the
parents slept in a house after a party the night before.

   Police say they captured a suspect in a
convenience store robbery after he returned the cash minutes after
he took it.
   David J. Rupp, 28, of Verona allegedly demanded money from early
Thursday and punched a customer, police said.
   The man left with cash from the register but soon returned. He
asked if the clerk had called police and placed the cash on the
counter when the clerk said he had not.
   ``You're not going to remember my face, are you?'' the man said
and fled.
   Another customer saw the license on the man's van and called
police, who arrested Rupp.
   Penn Hills Magistrate Rinaldo Secola arraigned Rupp on robbery
and assault charges and sent him to the Allegheny County Jail in
lieu of bond.

   A settlement to end the war in Afghanistan and
clear the way for the removal of Soviet troops is completed and
ready to be signed, a U.N. mediator said today.
   Radio Moscow reported that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
confirmed that Red Army troops will begin leaving Afghanistan on
May 15.
   In Pakistan, the Afghan guerrilla alliance said it won't be
bound by the agreement and vowed to continue the war until
Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government is overthrown.
   ``We have discussed, we have negotiated. That's over,'' mediator
Diego Cordovez told reporters in Geneva. ``I want to inform you
that the documents are now finalized and open for signature.''
   He said Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States, and the Soviet
Union were prepared to sign a five-point peace package worked out
during almost six years of on-and-off negotiations between
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   Pakistan represented Moslem guerrillas who have been fighting
the Afghan government since April 30, 1978, after a communist coup
set up a government friendly to the Soviet Union.
   Soviet troops entered the war on Dec. 1979 and an estimated
115,000 are in Afghanistan now.
   Radio Moscow reported that Gorbachev confirmed the May 15 troop
withdrawal during a speech to Communist Party officials in the
Soviet city of Tashkent, where he met Thursday with Afghan leader
Najib.
   Both leaders said Thursday that obstacles to an agreement had
been cleared and that the accord was ready to be signed.
   The Soviet Union's official Tass news agency filed an urgent
report out of Geneva this afternoon saying the agreement was
completed.
   Cordovez said the agreement was expected to be signed by
Thursday.
   ``It is not a perfect agreement because it was worked out by
human beings,'' but it ``reflects the reality of the situation,''
Cordovez said.
   ``The test of this agreement will come in its implementation,
and therefore I hope that people will give it a chance,'' he told
reporters. Cordovez added that he was convinced all parties ``will
exercise restraint in taking any actions'' that might violate the
agreement.
   But a statement from guerrilla alliance headquarters in
Peshawar, Pakistan said the agreement was made ``to be violated.''
   ``As far as the Mujahedeen are concerned, they will not be bound
by the outcome of the Geneva agreements and they will continue the
war as long as the Russians and their puppets are present in
Afghanistan,'' the statement said.
   When asked what language the United States and Soviet Union were
prepared to sign to guarantee the settlement, Cordovez said, ``All
that is pending.'' He would not elaborate.
   The mutual U.S.-Soviet guarantor role had been in doubt because
of a dispute over U.S. demands for ``symmetry'' in the amount of
superpower aid to the warring sides.
   The United States is the guerrillas' main weapons supplier. The
Soviet Union had argued that U.S. aid to insurgents couldn't be
compared to Soviet aid to the government.
   An official source at the Geneva talks, speaking on condition of
anonymity, indicated that a separate deal, outside the U.N. pact,
calls for a mutual aid cutoff as soon as the Soviet troops start
withdrawing.
   Cordovez refused to discuss the issue and said it was not part
of the peace package, but U.S. government sources in Washington
have said the agreement appears to meet U.S. conditions for ending
aid to the warring parties.
   The accord was reached after nearly six weeks of negotiations in
the latest round of indirect talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   Setting the time of signature ``involves a number of logistical
questions,'' said Cordovez, who mediated the talks by shuttling
back and forth between the delegations. Pakistan refused to meet in
person with the Afghan delegation because it does not recognize
Afghanistan's government.
   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan had objected to Pakistan's
insistence that arrangements for a transitional government in
Afghanistan be worked out before the signing of an accord.
   Cordovez said parties to the talks agreed that the settlement's
goals ``can best be ensured by a broad-based Afghan government. The
hope was therefore expressed that all elements of the Afghan
nation, living inside and outside Afghanistan, would respond to
this historic opportunity.''
   Cordovez said a fifth document has been added to the original
four-point accord _ a memorandum of understanding on U.N.
monitoring arrangements for the accord.
   The other documents include Afghan-Pakistani agreements on
principles of mutual relations and the safe and voluntary return of
Afghan refugees, a declaration of international guarantees, and a
fourth part tying the others together. The texts have not been made
public.
   Cordovez's announcement came less than an hour after
Afghanistan's envoy to the talks, Abdul Wakil, said his country was
ready to sign the accord.
   Minutes later, Pakistani chief envoy Zain Noorani reiterated
that his country was ready to sign. ``I would not be signing if I
was not satisfied,'' he told reporters.

   The number of AIDS cases reported by European
countries to the World Health Organization more than doubled during
last year, the U.N. agency said Friday.
   The WHO weekly newsletter said 28 countries had reported 10,181
cases as of Dec. 31, 1987, representing a 124 percent increase from
the 4,549 cases reported a year earlier.
   The highest European per capita rate was registered in France,
with 55.3 cases per million population, followed by Switzerland
with 53.8 per million and Denmark with 44.7 per million. This
compares with a rate in the United States of 216 per million
population, WHO said.
   The Netherlands reported a rate of 28.8 cases per million
population, Belgium 28, and West Germany 27.4.
   Among the East bloc countries, Czechoslovakia and Hungary
reported the highest number of cases, eight each, for rates of 0.5
and 0.8 cases per million population, respectively, WHO said.
   East Germany reported six cases, and the Soviet Union and Poland
reported three cases each, it said.

   The 2,100 uniformed military personnel being
temporarily sent to Panama will be added to the 10,000 U.S.
military personnel already stationed in the Central American nation.
   The 10,000 persons include:
   _7,000 Army soldiers, including the 193rd light infantry brigade
and a Special Forces battalion of about 200 men, all of whom are
attached to the Pentagon's Southern Command, based in Panama.
   _2,400 Air Force personnel, who maintain a variety of close-air
support aircraft, including C-130 gunships; A-7D Corsair jets; A-37
Dragonfly jets; and UH-1N Huey helicopters. All are stationed at
Howard Air Force Base.
   _600 Navy and Marine personnel. Most are Navy sailors, who
maintain a fleet of nine harbor patrol boats to help canal
navigation.
   The new personnel include about 500 Army military police; about
350 Army aviation troops; a reinforced Marine rifle company of 300
men; and 150 assorted Air Force personnel.
   Eight hundred Marines going to Panama from Camp Pendleton,
Calif., will be attending the three-week course at the Jungle
Operations Training Center, a jungle warfare school. The Pentagon
says the Marines' trip has nothing to do with the unrest in Panama.

<TEXT>
   About half the students at the University
of Mississippi law school want a faculty committee to reconsider
its recommendation the school dismiss its 1988 ``teacher of the
year'' co-winner.
   Students boycotted classes Thursday and have signed petitions in
support of Associate Professor Steve Thel.
   Thel ``is an outstanding professor,'' said Jack Williams, editor
of the Mississippi Law Journal on the Oxford campus.
   A committee of tenured law school faculty voted last month to
recommend administrators terminate Thel's contract, although he
will be allowed to finish the school year.
   The matter is pending before Dean Thomas Edmonds, who will make
his recommendation before forwarding the matter to Chancellor
Gerald Turner.
   The faculty committee's review of Thel's teaching, research and
productivity ``resulted in a vote not to continue his employment at
the unversity,'' Turner confirmed Wednesday.
   Thel, 34, a three-year university employee, declined to comment.
   At least 167 students _ about half the law school student body _
had signed a petition demanding Thel's contract be renewed, said
Williams, a third-year student from Amarillo, Texas.
   The petition claims tenured faculty members are playing politics
in their recommendation to terminate Thel's contract.
   ``We do not understand the logic behind ostracizing a professor
who has expressed a genuine concern for the academic development
and general welfare of the students,'' the petition said.
   Mike Leonard of Oxford, a first-year law student, said the
school's ``old guard'' doesn't like Thel. ``He's a Northerner, and
he's liberal,'' Leonard said. Turner denied that was a factor.
   Thel and Patricia Morgan were named ``teacher of the year'' in
student balloting last month.
   Edmonds, the law school dean, was out of town and unavailable
for comment on the student demands.
   Associate Dean Larry Bush said administrators canceled classes
for three hours Thursday because of a campus awards ceremony, ``so
it's difficult to tell how many didn't come to class.''
   Instructors at the school set their own policies on absenteeism,
he said.
   Officials said Thel is ineligible for tenure _ a guarantee of
job protection _ because he hasn't been at the university the
required six years.

   A free-lance photographer being evicted from a
high-rent apartment complex fatally stabbed the apartment manager
and her assistant and a high-level Veterans Administration official
waiting in an outer office with his daughter, police say.
   Jerry Singer, 36, was arrested shortly after the rampage
Thursday and charged with three counts of first-degree murder, said
Police Cmdr. Gerald Keller. Singer had a hunting knife with a
five-inch blade, Keller said.
   Keller said the attack occurred after apartment manager Cynthia
Graeber, 28, told Singer he was being evicted from his $798-a-month
apartment for failing to pay his rent for several months.
   Both Ms. Graeber and her assistant, Alice Wendt, 37, were slain,
police said. Ms. Graeber was stabbed as many as 30 times, they said.
   Dr. Francis E. ``Frank'' Conrad, 51, of Arlington, Va., who was
helping his daughter find an apartment in the city, also was killed
in the attack, police said. Conrad was national quality assurance
director for the VA.
   Singer was due to be evicted Monday, said Police Detective David
Ryan, adding that there was no indication of exactly what provoked
the attacks.
   ``He just snapped,'' said Police Lt. Terence McCue. ``It was
totally unprovoked. He just brandished his knife and began stabbing
them.''
   Conrad was sitting with his daughter and an employee of the
recently-built Old Town complex in an outer office when the
assailant entered, went ``right by them'' to the inner office,
Keller said.
   ``Immediately, they heard screams and shouts. At that point, Dr.
Conrad's daughter and the other complex employee ran out of the
office onto the street to flag down a squad car,'' the commander
said.
   Conrad's daughter, Dr. Lisa Conrad, was seeking an apartment in
preparation for her medical residency here, Keller said.
   All three victims were dead on arrival at Northwestern Memorial
Hospital, said spokeswoman Sandra Mines.
   Conrad was a former associate professor of clinical psychiatry
and associate dean of veterans affairs at State University of New
York, Stony Brook, said VA spokeswoman Donna St. John.

   Pilots have been warned to be
extraordinarily careful over parts of central Wisconsin this
weekend and next week because 400 to 500 military aircraft will be
taking part in eight days of mock air battles.
   ``Many of these are fighter aircraft, traveling at speeds up to
700 mph and flying as low as 100 feet off the ground. Needless to
say, non-military pilots would be wise to stay out of the area
completely,'' said John Dorcey, aviation safety manager for the
state Department of Transportation.
   The exercise beginning Saturday and running through April 16
will take place in an area bounded roughly by Eau Claire, Stevens
Point, Oshkosh, Wisconsin Dells and La Crosse.
   The exercise, called Sentry Independence, involves thousands of
participants from the Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, the
active Air Force, Army National Guard, Army Reserve, Marine Corps
and the Navy Reserve.
   It's the fifth year of the exercise, but for the first time the
participants will include members of the German and Netherlands air
forces, Dorcey said.

   The Stanford University Medical Center
has performed a rare transplant operation in which a man gave his
heart to another and then received the heart and lungs of an
anonymous donor.
   The patients were doing well Thursday, said Vaughn Starnes,
chief of the center's heart-lung transplant program.
   In the ``domino'' operation April 1, John Hasenkamp received the
heart of Steve Rasmussen, who got a new heart and lungs.
   Starnes said Rasmussen, 28, of Santa Cruz, was near death from
lung disease but his heart was healthy. Hasenkamp, 48, of Redwood
City, had a damaged heart.
   The only other transplant of this kind on record was performed
last May at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, officials said.
   Both heart and lungs were transplanted into Rasmussen because
that method provides the necessary blood supply for healing, said
Starnes.

   Orbison, who made his fame decades ago with such hits as
``Pretty Woman'' and ``Only the Lonely,'' says he's found that
while working with some of today's top recording artists.
   ``With some of the people, because of who they are, I expect
that we'll be writing a rock 'n' roll tune. And it turns out that
they have more of a Roy Orbison-type ballad in mind,'' he said in a
recent interview.
   ``Lately, though, we're just writing songs, which I prefer _ not
trying to imitate anything in particular from the past. And nobody
dominates the writing sessions, it's just whichever of us has the
hot idea at the moment.''
   Earlier this week Orbison, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne worked on a
new album he expects to have out later this year.
   ``We just finished one tune and hope to finish another. I have
enough material for an album already, but I'd like to get three or
four more. That shouldn't be a problem.''
   Probably not for the man whose been a perennial favorite for
three decades with such hits as ``Crying,'' ``Running Scared,''

   Police today dispersed about 800
demonstrators who tried to rally in front of the U.S. Embassy
calling for the dismantling of American military bases in the
country.
   Police said at least 20 police officers suffered minor injuries.
Three demonstrators were arrested, they said.
   The demonstrators were negotiating with police officials late in
the afternoon when a group of protesters dashed across the street
towards the embassy.
   The police gave chase, using riot clubs, while another group
succeeded in going to the side of the embassy. Other demonstrators
hurled stones at the riot police.
   A fire truck opened their water cannons against the
demonstrators who scurried into sidestreets fronting the U.S.
embassy.
   Earlier, the demonstrators were chanting ``dismantle the U.S.
bases'' and ``down with imperialists'' as they arrived near the
embassy from a downtown plaza.
   Police Col. Conrado Francisco said at least 20 policemen
suffered stoning and clubbing injuries.
   A rally official who spoke on condition of anonymity said they
had no figures on how many demonstrators were injured but said two
leaders were apprehended by police.
   Police could not immediately confirm the arrest of the two
officials but said they arrested three other demonstrators.
   The United States and the Philippines began talks last Tuesday
on the status of American military bases here. The outcome of the
talks, expected to last three months, will determine whether the
government allows the bases to remain after their lease expires in
1991.
   The six U.S. bases are the largest American installations left
in Southeast Asia.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt, head of the American negotiating
panel, says the installations are essential to protect the region
from Soviet expansion.

Retaliation</HEAD>

   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
threatened retaliation Friday after Japan blocked a U.S. request
for creation of an international panel to resolve a dispute over
beef and citrus imports.
   Yeutter also urged Japanese industrialists to use their
political clout to block the protectionist measures for which
Japan's farmers are lobbying.
   ``I regret the Japanese today blocked our request for the
formation of an independent ... panel to review Japan's beef and
citrus quotas and other restrictive practices,'' Yeutter said in a
statement.
   Hours earlier, Yeutter told National Public Radio, ``If the
intransigent attitude that prevails in Japan at the moment on beef
and citrus continues, we are clearly heading toward retaliation by
the United States, and somebody will pay the price.''
   ``It may or may not be the Japanese agricultural producers, but
someone will have to pay the price of retaliation,'' he said.
   The Japanese move came Friday in Geneva at a session of GATT,
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The United States asked GATT to form a panel of independent
experts to determine whether the Japanese citrus and beef import
quotas were consistent with international trading laws.
   But the Japanese ambassador, Yoshio Hatano, rejected the panel,
saying the dispute should be resolved in bilateral discussions.
Since GATT council decisions are made by consensus, the U.S.
request was effectively rejected.
   Yeutter said the United States would continue to consult with
Japan, but if a solution is not found in the coming weeks it will
renew its request for an independent panel at the next GATT meeting
on May 4.
   ``Continued resistance to the establishment of a panel at that
time would undoubtedly lead to further escalation of this
dispute,'' he said.
   Yeutter told NPR he had information that Japanese industry is
already reacting to the possibility that the United States might
curb its imports of Japanse goods as a retaliatory measure.
   ``I just saw a cable today that indicates that a number of
Japanese industrialists are now beginning to speak up on the issue
because they are fearful that if it is not resolved
satisfactorily'' they will suffer retaliation, he said.
   ``They should be pounding the desk of Japanese government
officials, saying `don't let the agriculture folks have the
controlling voice in this issue,'' Yeutter added.
   The U.S.-Japanese agreement on citrus and beef imports expired
last month and no new accord has been reached. Under the 1984
agreement, Japan agreed to admit 141,000 tons of American beef in
1984, rising to 177,000 tons this year. The agreement called for a
1,100-ton a year increase over the 1984 quota on U.S. organge
imports of 82,000 tons.
   The quotas are being demanded by the politically powerful
Japanese beef and citrus farmers.
   U.S. officials argue that the Japanese would benefit greatly by
imports, saying that beefsteak in Japan now costs four times the
U.S. price and citrus costs at least double the American market
price.

watching his every move and those by people around him.
   The constant protection has a price in personal freedom, as well
as in dollars.
   The Secret Service has protected five 1988 presidential
candidates, not including Vice President George Bush, for the past
few months at a cost of $15,000 a day for each man.
   Until the number of candidates began to dwindle _ the federal
agency only protects two now _ the cost to the taxpayers was
$75,000 a day or $525,000 a week.
   As expensive as that might sound, it pales at what was spent to
guard Pope John Paul II during his 11-day visit to the United
States last year _ $4.9 million or some $445,455 per day.
   Secret Service Director John R. Simpson and Francis A. Keating,
assistant Treasury Secretary for enforcement, in recent testimony
and documentation submitted to a Senate appropriations
subcommittee, called the Pope's visit to the United States ``the
single most demanding protective event in our history.''
   The Secret Service received a supplemental appropriation of $5.6
million to cover the costs of the pontiff's visit, in addition to
its regular budget of $367 million for the fiscal year that ends
Sept. 30.
   Keating, who has since been nominated to be the Justice
Department's No. 3 man, and Simpson said the Secret Service has
protected four Democrats and one Republican presidential candidates
over the past four or five months. Vice President Bush gets
coverage by virtue of his office, and Democrats Albert Gore Jr. and
Jesse Jackson also receive the protection.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Kansas Sen. Bob Dole
declined protection. Kitty Dukakis, the governor's wife, said
Dukakis believes that ``it would be just one additional layer from
the people.'' Walt Riker, Dole's press secretary, said Dole has a
similar belief.
   Candidate dropouts Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Gary
Hart of Colorado also received Secret Service escorts. So did
Republican Pat Robertson, who has all but abandoned his race.
   Keating said the Secret Service never guarded Bruce Babbitt,
Alexander Haig and Pete du Pont because a five-member advisory
committee did not recommend them to the Treasury secretary who
makes the final decision.
   Candidate protection is determined by a panel consisting of a
Supreme Court justice, the Senate majority leader and minority
leaders and the House speaker and minority leader, who meet to make
recommendations to the Treasury secretary. Among the things taken
into consideration: the number of delegates a candidate receives
and whether any death threats have been made against the candidate.
   If the secretary accepts the panel's recommendations, the
candidate is notified. To decline protection, a candidate must
inform the secretary in writing.
   The Secret Service received an appropriation of $29.9 million
for fiscal 1988 to provide the protection during the campaign. The
agency is seeking another $7.1 million to cover the campaign period
from Oct. 1 until the Nov. 8 election, and then for coverage of the
president-elect, the vice president-elect and their families and
spouses through the inauguration.

   Lyn Nofziger, President Reagan's former
political director, was sentenced to 90 days in prison today and
fined $30,000 for illegally lobbying administration officials after
he left the White House.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Flannery said Nofziger could remain
free pending an appeal of his three felony convictions of
contacting former colleagues on behalf of private clients within a
year of leaving President Reagan's staff.
   Nofziger could have been sentenced to two years on each of the
three counts. The $30,000 was the maximum cumulative fine the judge
could have assessed.
   Flannery imposed a complicated sentence of two to eight months'
incarceration for each of the counts but then suspended all but 30
days of each of the sentences so that Nofziger will have to serve
only 90 days if his appeal is denied.
   The judge rejected the defense plea that Nofziger be sentenced
only to a short period of unsupervised probation.
   Outside the courthouse, Nofziger told reporters, ``I thought
things were going to go better than they went.''
   Asked about the prospects of an appeal, Nofziger said, ``In my
heart of hearts, I don't believe I'm going to serve time because I
don't believe a prison sentence is justified even if I were guilty.
And I repeat that I am not guilty.''
   Before he was sentenced, Nofziger stood before the judge and
said he wanted to reiterate ``my belief that despite my conviction
I have done nothing ethically, morally or legally wrong.''
   ``I am an honorable man,'' Nofziger told the judge.
   ``Like other honorable people, I have gone through life making
mistakes, doing stupid things. I doubt that there is a person in
this room who hasn't. But I am not a criminal and I think the
record of my life will bear out that statement.''
   President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, issued a statement from
their vacation home in California that said in full:
   Lyn Nofziger is s dear friend of many years and our prayers are
with him.''
   Flannery ordered Nofziger to pay the $30,000 fine within 30
days. Like the prison term, however, the imposition of the fine was
stayed pending appeal.
   The judge also ordered that after his imprisonment Nofziger be
placed on two years' probation. The judge agreed to a defense
request that Nofziger be sent to a minimum-security federal prison.
   Before he was sentenced, Nofziger told the judge, ``I know there
are those in this ourtroom who believe that I should be sent to
prison unless I come here today and plead guilt, express remorse
and ask forgiveness.''
   But, he added, ``I cannot do that if I am to be true to myself
and to those hundreds of fine people all over the country who have
supported me in recent months because they believe I am an
honorable man.''
   Still, Nofziger said, ``I do have remorse. I am distressed
beyond measure. I trusted in others rather than relying on myself.
I am distressed if I have embarrassed my family and my friends and
my president.''
   After the hearing, independent counsel James C. McKay said,
``We're very satisfied with what Judge Flannery has done today.''
   McKay had declined in court to make an additional statement on
the sentence he had sought. The prosecutor, who said in a court
filing that Nofziger had shown ``a total lack of contrition and
remorse,'' had urged imprisonment to signal the seriousness of
Nofziger's offense.
   Nofziger, asked by reporters how he felt about the sentence,
called the question ``stupid'' and added:
   ``How do you think I feel? What do you want me to do, say I feel
great?''
   Nofziger charged that McKay ``set out to get me. He set out
because I would not knuckle under, because I would not cop a plea,
and because I would not say that I was remorseful, and I think he
succeeded.''
   Nofziger said he thought McKay ``makes mountains out of
molehills. He has exaggerated. He has misstated. And I think he has
lied.''
   ``I don't think he is an honorable man,'' he said.
   When the sentenced was pronounced, Nofziger shook hands with
several people in the courtroom, then kissed his wife and other
family members. One man said he was sorry; Nofziger shrugged.
   For the defense, lawyer Robert Plotkin told reporters, ``We're
disappointed, but I think the judge did a good job of trying to
balance the symbol Mr. Nofziger has become (for the ethics law)
against the man Mr. Nofziger is.''
   Nofziger, 63, was sentenced for illegally lobbying former Reagan
administration colleagues on behalf of Wedtech Corp., the
scandal-wracked defense contractor, and a marine engineers union.
   He had been found guilty Feb. 11 of violating the Ethics in
Government Act, which restricts lobbying by former government
officials. Nofziger likened his offense to ``running a stop sign.''
   A number of current and former government officials, including
Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, Energy Secretary John Herrington
and Secret Service director John R. Simpson, had signed letters
vouching for Nofziger's integrity and character.
   Herrington urged the judge to ``show compassion and
understanding'' and Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., asked Flannery to
balance ``the requirements of justice with the quality of mercy.''
   Nofziger was convicted of urging then-presidential counselor
Edwin Meese III to intercede to help Wedtech get a $32 million
no-bid Army contract to build small engines. Wedtech got the
contract.
   Nofziger was also convicted of illegally contacting Meese's
deputy, James E. Jenkins for the Marine Engineers Beneficial
Association, which was seeking to expand civilian manning of Navy
support ships.
   The third conviction dealt with a contact Nofziger had with two
National Security Council aides for Fairchild Republic Corp., which
made the A-10 anti-tank plane.
   In his sentencing memo, McKay also urged a large fine, arguing
that Nofziger had unjustly enriched himself through violations of
the law. McKay noted that Nofziger and his business partner, Mark
A. Bragg, received stock in Wedtech Corp. as a result of the
successful effort to lobby Meese, now attorney general.
   Nofziger and Bragg sold their stock for more than $600,000,
according to congressional testimony. McKay said Nofziger's net
worth is more than $2.8 million.

   The following is a partial text of
exchanges between Beirut control tower and the hijacked Kuwait
Airways jetliner as the plane tried to land at Beirut on Friday, as
obtained and translated by The Associated Press:
   The pilot asked the Beirut tower for permission to land, saying
the hijackers are threatening to land ``by force.''
   Tower: If you try to land by force, the plane will be fired on.
   Pilot: A gun is pointed at my head. I request landing permission
to load to refuel.
   Tower: We have been for 14 years under gunfire.
   (Hijackers then ask tower to pass along message to Interior
Minister Abdullah Rassi asking only for permission to refuel. Rassi
broadcast a refusal.)
   Hijacker: I shall punish control tower officials if they don't
allow us to land. The passengers are all in panic now and many of
them are vomiting. Among the passengers is a member of the Kuwaiti
royal family with a heart condition.
   Tower: With all due respect to all families, permit me to say
that all the Lebanese suffer heart ailments. Do not try to talk to
me sentimentally.
   Passenger: I plead with you to allow us to land in Beirut. The
hijackers insist on landing in Beirut and emphatically refuse to go
to any other airport. There is no fuel left to take us to another
airport.
   Pilot: Please inform the ministers of justice, interior and
public works that we are compelled to land at Beirut Airport. There
is no other option for us.
   Tower: There is no chance of landing. You will have to shoulder
the responsibility of your action.
   Pilot: If you fail to clear the runways within a few minutes, we
will land in the sea.
   Tower: Do whatever you want. Crash on the tarmac or in the sea
... We shall not let you land here.

<HEAD>Pope Denounces Abuses, Seeks Settlement with Rebel Bishop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Friday condemned
doctrinal and liturgical abuses in the Roman Catholic church and
said he still hopes for a settlement with rebel French Archbishop
Marcel Lefebvre.
   ``The need to distinguish from what authentically builds up the
church from what destroys her is becoming in the present period a
particular demand of our service to the whole community of
believers,'' the pope wrote Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the
Vatican's powerful guardian of church orthodoxy.
   Ratzinger's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has
worked toward reaching a settlement with Lefebvre, who heads the
traditionalist Pius X Fraternity, based in Switzerland.
   Lefebvre was suspended from his priestly functions by Pope Paul
VI in 1976, meaning he is not allowed by the Vatican to say Mass or
give the sacraments.
   He continues to celebrate the forbidden 16th century Latin
Tridentine Mass and claims to have millions of followers worldwide.
   In October, the pope charged Cardinal Edouard Gagnon with the
task of trying to resolve the Lefebvre case.
   Lefebvre has ordained illegally more than 200 priests in the
past 15 years. In February, he was quoted in an interview with the
French newspaper Le Figaro as saying he planned to consecrate three
bishops this June, a move that would lead to his automatic
excommunication.
   ``Your Eminence knows very well how many efforts have been made
by the Apostolic See since the beginning of the existence of the
`fraternity,' in order to ensure ecclesial unity in relation to its
activity,'' the pope wrote Ratzinger in a letter released by the
Vatican.
   ``I would assure your eminence once more of my desire that these
efforts should continue. We do not cease to hope that ... they will
bear fruit,'' the pope wrote.
   Also referring to Lefebvre, the pope wrote: ``All the bishops of
the Catholic Church ... are bound to collaborate with the Apostolic
See for the welfare of the whole mystical body, which is also the
body of the churches.''
   In his letter, the pope said the church was striving to ensure
that the doctrine of the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council was being
followed.
   ``However, side by side with this effort there have appeared
tendencies which create a certain difficulty in putting the council
into practice,'' the letter said. ``One of these tendencies is
characterized by a desire for changes which are not always in
harmony with the teaching and spirit of Vatican Council II.''
   ``These changes claim to express progress,'' the letter
continued, ``and so this tendency is given the name
`progressivism.' In this case, progress consists in an aspiration
towards the future which breaks with the past, without taking into
account the function of tradition, which is fundamental to the
church's mission.''
   The pope also denounced what he described as the opposite
tendency of ``conservatism'' or ``integrism.'' This tendency
``stops at the past itself, without taking into account the correct
aspiration towards the future,'' he wrote.

   President Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, had an adjusted gross income of $345,359 in 1987 with a
federal tax liability of $86,638, according to tax returns released
today.
   That income was $8,990 above what the Reagans reported for 1986,
while their tax bill rose $5,822. Taxes as a percentage of the
Reagans' gross income rose from 25.1 percent to 27.5 percent.
   The couple had $67,392 withheld for federal income taxes last
year and paid an additional $30,000 in quarterly payments, for a
total of $97,392.
   That means they paid $10,754 above what they owed the
government. Rather than getting a refund, the couple elected to
apply that amount to their 1988 taxes.
   Included in the gross income was the president's $200,000
salary, $54,179 in interest income, $46,208 in capital gains and
$29,711 in income from his pension for serving as governor of
California from 1967-75.
   The income also included $1,526 in appearance fees paid to the
president and Mrs. Reagan. This included $1,312 paid to Reagan for
his appearance on NBC-TV's ``Tonight'' show and $214 paid to Mrs.
Reagan in residual talent fees for re-runs of two programs in which
she had appeared in 1986.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the $1,312 fee paid
to the president was ``required to be paid ... under union
agreements'' in the television industry, and said that the $1,312
was donated along with other money to his alma matter, Eureka
College in Illionois.
   Charitable deductions totaled $25,407.
   After deductions, the Reagans' total taxable income was $263,767.
   The tax returns were released a day after White House chief of
staff Howard Baker said that Reagan and his wife had made sure
``all of the i's were dotted and the t's were crossed'' before
leasing a $2.5 million Los Angeles home purchased by friends.
   But questions about the arrangements the Reagans made with the
consortium that purchased the home persist. These involve the
secrecy surrounding the identities of the 18 to 20 Reagan friends
who purchased the home, and the question of why the Reagans decided
to lease, rather than buy, the house.
   The Reagans consider the home-leasing arrangement a private
matter, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater has said. And on
Thursday, Baker said the pair ``may not like'' all the press
scrutiny surrounding the deal.
   In Washington, Donald Campbell, the deputy director of the
Office of Government Ethics, confirmed that lawyers representing
the consortium approached the agency in July 1986, and ``we did
make an analysis'' of the proposition at the time.
   Campbell said the office produced an informal opinion on the
ethical ramifications of the deal.
   The White House, which has made only a limited disclosure of the
terms of the three-year lease the Reagans signed effective March 1,
said that before buying the three-bedroom, six-bath house, the
prospective owners, most of them friends of the Reagans, sought an
opinion on the propriety of the deal.
   It said the opinion concluded that the Reagans would comply with
standards of conduct regulations and conflict of interest statutes
if they paid a fair-market rental or purchase price.
   It said the lease terms were negotiated by representatives of
the owners and the Reagans, based on fair-market value rental
estimates from two independent appraisers.
   The home, on a 1\-acre property in the poshest section of Bel
Air, is near the Kirkeby estate where the television series
``Beverly Hillbillies'' was filmed. It has a heated swimming pool
and a three-car garage.
   Real estate sources estimate the monthly rent at $12,000 to
$15,000, based on fair-market value.
   The Reagans are known to feel strongly about their privacy, and
the first lady during the early years of the administration made it
clear she wanted information about the president's health handled
carefully by the White House press office. And the first couple has
chafed over past reporting of difficulties involving Reagan
children and relatives.
   On Thursday, Baker was asked if the president and his wife were
upset by the spate of media reports on the home-leasing deal.
   ``Oh, I don't think so,'' said Baker, standing outside a seaside
resort hotel cottage not far from Reagan's mountaintop ranch. ``I
think after eight years, they've come to understand that that
occurs, and while they understand it, they may not like it, but
they are not angry about it.
   ``The White House, the president and the first lady went to
great lengths to make sure that this was an arms-length
transaction, that there was a full appraisal of the rental property
and that all of the i's were dotted and the t's were crossed,'' he
said.
   Baker said that Reagan and his wife have handled the leasing of
the home ``in precisely the right way and really beyond legitimate
criticism.''
   The property was purchased in August 1986 by the consortium,
which has incorporated itself as Wall Management Services, Inc.
   Realtor Jeff Hyland of the Los Angeles firm of Alvarez, Hyland &
Young, said that with rising prices since the purchase, the land
alone is worth $3 million.
   ``They got a great buy,'' he said. ``They bought it for land
value. As far as I am concerned, they got the house for free.''
   Realtor John Aaroe of the Jon Douglas Co. said the house, built
in 1954, still has the original kitchen and needs a great deal of
renovation.

   Newsweek magazine has decided to end its special
editions, Newsweek on Campus and Newsweek on Health, both of which
have been losing money.
   The decision was disclosed to the magazines' staffs on Thursday,
said Diana Pearson, Newsweek's communications director. No
editorial staff members will lose their jobs but six space sellers
for the publications will be let go, she said.
   The publications' revenue came solely from advertising.
   Newsweek on Health, a quarterly that prints 500,000 copies and
mails them to 250,000 doctors' and dentists' offices, will bow out
after the spring issue.
   Newsweek on Campus will have two more editions, in May and
September. Its 1.3 million copies are inserted into school
newspapers at more than 200 colleges and universities and also are
mailed to students who subscribe to Newsweek.
   To cope with a 20 percent rise in print and postage costs,
Newsweek also will raise its basic subscription rate by about 10
percent. The weekly's circulation is 94 percent by subscription and
6 percent at the $2 cover price at newsstands.
   Newsweek's current circulation base is 3,198,000, Pearson said.
The magazine is owned by the Washington Post Co.

<HEAD>New Code on Plastic Bottles Intended to Promote Recycling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plastic bottles soon will carry a single-digit
number inside a triangle on the bottom to help guide recyclers and
promote the practice, a plastics industry group said Friday.
   The numbers, a half-inch high or larger, will designate the kind
of plastic used, according to Council on Plastics and Packaging in
the Environment.
   ``There is a perception that plastics are not recyclable,'' but
it is untrue, said Dennis Sabourin of Wellman Industries, a major
buyer of used polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, soft drink
bottles.
   Sabourin said his company buys 100 million pounds of used
bottles a year, about two-thirds of the 20 percent of all PET
bottles that are recycled. It could use twice as many bottles and
in a few years could need three times the current amount, he said.
   ``The industry feels it's better to self-regulate than to be
regulated,'' said Gifford Stack, recycling manager for the National
Soft Drink Association.
   The council called a news conference to present its view that
trash disposal should make room for recycling, incineration,
landfilling and composting. Plastics, it said, are 7.2 percent of
the national garbage stream of 133 million tons a year.
   The council knows of at least 256 bills in 35 state
legislatures, ``probably more than on any other issue around,''
dealing with garbage, said Jeff Lane of Procter & Gamble Co.
   There have been several bills that would simply outlaw certain
plastic containers, although none has passed above the local level,
Lane said. Several other bills would require some form of recycling
code.
   The voluntary identification system devised by the Society of
the Plastics Industry calls for number codes on all plastic bottles
of 16 ounces or larger, and other containers of 8 ounces or more.
Almost all recycling markets are designed to handle one kind of
plastic at a time, though various efforts are under way to develop
techniques to separate mixed plastics.
   The triangle surrounding the number will have an arrowhead
incorporated in each side, the arrows pointing clockwise.
Underneath will be letter abbreviations or acronyms representing
the plastic.
   Codes should start appearing within six months and appear on all
containers within three years, Lane said.
   Currently, soft drink bottles are almost made of PET, and milk
bottles are high-density polyethylene, and recyclers can recognize
these easily. These materials and other plastics are used in other
containers that could be recycled if they could be quickly
identified also, the council said.
   Here are number and abbreviation codes:
   1. Polyethylene terephthalate, PET.
   2. High-density polyethylene, HDPE.
   3. Vinyl, V.
   4. Low-density polyethylene, LDPE.
   5. Polypropylene, PP.
   6. Polystyrene, PS
   7. Other plastics, including bottles of more than one kind,
OTHER.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Friday that Soviet
troops will begin coming home from Afghanistan on May 15, but he
added the move shouldn't be seen as ``a present to President
Reagan'' for their upcoming summit meeting.
   Soviets interviewed on the streets of Moscow welcomed the news,
saying ``Many people have suffered.''
   Radio Moscow carried a brief report on Gorbachev's speech to
party activists in Tashkent following the announcement in Geneva
that negotiators had agreed on a plan for settling the 10-year-old
war in Afghanistan.
   Gorbachev and Afghan leader Najib met in Tashkent, in Central
Asia, on Thursday and declared in a joint communique that all
obstacles to a war settlement and withdrawal of the Soviet forces
had been removed.
   The official Tass news agency did not immediately report the
57-year-old Soviet leader's speech, and the nightly TV news program
``Vremya'' said only that Gorbachev had met with Uzbek party
leaders before returning to Moscow. But Radio Moscow led its
evening newscasts with a few details of the address.
   It said Gorbachev confirmed Soviet soldiers would begin pulling
out of the conflict they entered more than eight years ago, and
that documents outlining terms of the peace accord were ready for
signing on Thursday.
   ``At the same time, the Soviet leader said the withdrawal of the
troops should not be regarded as a sort of present to President
Reagan on the eve of his visit to the U.S.S.R.,'' the official
broadcast said. ``We, he said, are carrying out the plans outlined
in our statement in February.''
   It was in a Feb. 8 speech by Gorbachev that the May 15 date was
first proposed, but at the time it was made contingent on a Geneva
agreement being signed by March 15. That speech also offered to
``front-load'' the withdrawal, or have at least half of the
estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers leave within the first three
months, and to complete the withdrawal within 10 months.
   Soviet officials have observed privately, however, that they
would like to have all of their troops home by the end of the year.
Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan on Dec. 27, 1979.
   A senior U.S. diplomat said Friday that back-channel U.S.-Soviet
diplomacy was involved in clearing the final obstacle to a Geneva
agreement: the question of continued aid to the warring sides.
   U.S. observers at the Geneva talks had been pressing for
``symmetry'' in foreign aid to the combatants, arguing that if U.S.
assistance to the rebels was prohibited, the Kremlin should
likewise cut off military aid to Najib's government.
   ``The Soviets know very well and in great detail our position
and have indicated that it is acceptable to them,'' said the
diplomat, who briefed reporters on condition he not be identified.
   He said the Reagan administration prefers a moratorium on arms
shipments to continued deliveries to both sides, but that no
agreement had been worked out yet.
   The senior envoy also suggested that the Soviets' steadfast
efforts to stick to the May 15 start date for withdrawal was likely
connected with a general attempt to clear away superpower
disagreements in advance of the May 29-June 2 summit meeting in
Moscow.
   ``I think they are cognizant of the value in having their troops
begin to leave Afghanistan before the president comes,'' he said.
``It would probably create a better atmosphere at the summit if
they have started.''
   News of the agreement in Geneva, which is to be signed Thursday,
traveled slowly to Soviet citizens, who get most of their news on
international affairs from ``Vremya.'' Evening newspapers went to
press before U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez announced in Geneva that
a package of documents outlining the settlement was ready for
signing.
   Soviets told about the breakthrough in Geneva said they were
delighted with the news.
   ``It's time to get out already,'' said Sergei Butyugin of Moscow
at a news stand near Taganka Square. ``Many people have suffered.''
   Butyugin, 32, said the decision to enter the war was correct
because their Afghan allies asked for help, but that ``now it has
dragged on and on.''
   A 27-year-old woman who did not want to give her name said she
welcomed the news that a settlement had been reached and said the
war had hurt the Soviet people.
   ``All's well that ends well,'' declared Larisa Ivanova, 41.
``The main thing is that there will be peace.''
   She said the war had taken a heavy toll on Soviets, although she
said she didn't know how many of her countrymen had been killed in
Afghanistan. Casualty figures have never been reported by the
Soviets.
   Six soldiers approached by an Associated Press reporter outside
the Dzerzhinsky Military Academy along the Moscow River refused to
discuss the war or its influence on the Soviet Union.
   ``I don't have a personal opinion, we only have a government
opinion,'' one said.

   The far right exulted Friday in a
victory in a seditious conspiracy trial, but others said the very
freedoms of the country they attacked allowed the white
supremacists to exist.
   ``The jury's verdict speaks for a growing patriotic sentiment to
`just say no' to black power in America,'' said Richard Barrett,
42, of Jackson, Miss., a lawyer for the Forsyth County Defense
League in Georgia.
   ``The jury's verdict announces that pro-majority Americans are
not a cult, but are a rising voice of the silent majority,'' he
added.
   Barrett briefly attended the federal court trial, which began
Feb. 16 and ended Thursday with an all-white jury's acquittal on
all charges of the 13 white defendants. Nine of them were accused
of plotting to overthrow the government by violence and set up an
all-white nation in the Pacific Northwest.
   ``What I find interesting is that the system they hate so much
has set them free,'' said Norman Gissel, a lawyer from Coeur
d'Alene, Idaho. He is chairman of the Kootenai County Task Force on
Human Relations, which was formed to resist movements advocating
racial violence after the Aryan Nations was based at nearby Hayden
Lake.
   Eva Sears, spokeswoman for the Center for Democratic Renewal in
Atlanta, said the verdict makes it ``clear that it's not possible
to rely on legal solutions.'' What is needed, she said, is ``more
community involvement to counteract'' the white-power movement with
``all non-violent appropriate responses.''
   ``It is ironic'' that the the freedoms of American citizenship _
the right to speak out, the right to trial by jury _ protected
those who spoke against the government, Ms. Sears said.
   The voices of the far right ``are going to view that acquittal
as a green light,'' she said. ``They are going to step up their
activity. So it is very, very important that those of us who love
democracy become more vigilant.''
   Prosecutors sought to prove the supremacists robbed banks and
armored trucks of $4.1 million to finance their activities,
including about $1 million still missing. The jury deliberated four
days.
   The defense contended the conspiracy theory was made up by a key
government witness, James Ellison, 47, who led a supremacist group
in Arkansas and is serving 20 years for racketeering.
   To discredit Ellison, the defense disclosed he had two wives,
thought he received messages from God and had himself crowned King
James of the Ozarks.
   In Grand Rapids, Mich., Urban League national President John
Jacobs said the verdict was another example of the resurgence of
racism in the United States.
   ``We are seeing a climate that is permissive of racist
behavior,'' he said. ``People have become comfortable in engaging
in this climate. Every time something like this happens, it sets
back the whole movement for fairness, equality and justice. You can
be a racist and get away with it, and that is a very disturbing
message.''
   On the CBS ``This Morning'' program Friday, the U.S. attorney
who prosecuted the case, J. Michael Fitzhugh, said: ``We thought we
had a good prosecutable case. ... But the jury chose otherwise and
that's the great thing about this country is our jury system.''
   Peter Lake, a television producer who was the government's first
witness, said on the same program that earlier convictions of some
of the defendants may have caused the jury to think they were being
prosecuted a second time for the same things.
   Lake, who testified about what he saw and heard when he went
undercover into the Aryan Nations compound at Hayden Lake, Idaho,
was optimistic about the acquittal.
   ``I think that the radical right will be forever changed by this
decision here,'' he said. ``They have a dilemma. They were
protesting about the federal government and now they've been
treated fairly by the federal government. That's going to have a
telling effect.''
   He said some older leaders ``told me that they were going to get
out of the business, in essence. They're going to go home and write
books, pass their churches on to someone else.''

   Foreign relief workers on Friday
began complying with a government order to return from the
drought-stricken north where civil war has stymied efforts to feed
millions of people threatened with starvation.
   About 24 expatriates returned to Addis Ababa, the capital,
aboard a U.N.-chartered Hercules C-130 transport plane. Two of the
aircraft had been used to carry food into the most severely
drought-affected regions of Tigre and Eritrea.
   The returning workers included employees of the Geneva-based
International Committee for the Red Cross, the Belguim group
Medicin Sans Frontieres (Doctor Without Borders) and Action
Internationale Contra La Faim. They had been operating out of the
Eritrean town of Asmara and are among about 60 expatriates sent to
the north, where crop failure threatens more than 3 million people
with starvation.
   It was unclear when the rest of the foreign relief personnel in
other northern towns would be pulled out.
   The government Relief and Rehabilitation Commission on Wednesday
ordered all relief agencies to bring its foreign workers from the
north ``to avoid personnel security risks'' from rebels operating
in the area. The commission said it would assume responsibility for
the massive relief operation, which already had been crippled by
the civil wars in Eritrea and Tigre.
   The order came a week after President Mengistu Haile Mariam
admitted for the first time that his government was in a ``grim
struggle'' with northern rebels. He called for a national
mobilization of troops.
   Since then, government vehicles used in the relief operation and
planes flying domestic and international routes for state-owned
Ethiopian Airlines have been requisitioned to move troops and
equipment, relief officials said.
   Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years against the
central government. It is Africa's longest civil war. In
neighboring Tigre, rebels have been fighting for 14 years.
   None of the foreign relief workers in the north wanted to leave
or expressed any fears for their safety, said agency officials. The
officials said the doubted the commission could handle the food
distribution operation alone.
   ``We're facing a very catastrophic situation right now,'' said
one senior relief official. ``It will take months to resolve the
war. In the meantime, you've got three million souls up there and
the government is not going to let any food out at all.''
   Government officials plan to feed only those people in the few
government-held areas, primarily urban centers which are home to
only a fraction of the drought-affected population.
   ``Three million people have somehow got to get food,'' the
relief official said.
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front and the Eritrea Liberation
Front have said the order removing foreign relief workers from the
north was an attempt to choke off their rebellions.

<TEXT>
   An award-winning play about a student's suicide
has been deleted from a San Jacinto College literary magazine
because the school chancellor believes the play's language is too
offensive.
   ``It's an excellent play. Good work. But I had a real problem
with the harsh language. I'm the publisher and it's sold to
students and the community we serve,'' Chancellor Tom Sewell said.
   As a result Robert Earl Milstid's play ``Just A Phase,'' about a
17-year-old student whose social and domestic woes drive him to a
beer-soaked suicide, has been dumped from next week's issue of The
Prism.
   ``I'm not a member of the Moral Majority or anything, but it's
not appropriate for the public we send it to,'' Sewell said.
   The one-act play drew big crowds last year during three
performances, received good reviews in the campus newspaper and in
December earned the author an Excellence in Play Writing honor for
originality at the American College Theater Festival in Denton.
   Sewell said he would have considered barring the campus
production had he known about its content beforehand.
   Milstid, 24, said he used cursing in his play for realism, not
for shock.
   ``It's sad that one person in a high position has a right to
dictate his opinions to college students about what we can and
can't read,'' Milstid said. ``But I understand where he's coming
from. I'm used to dealing with overly conservative viewpoints.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Milos Jakes
on Friday launched a stern attack on the Western media, accusing
them of creating unrest in Czechoslovakia.
   Addressing a two-day meeting of the party's Central Committee,
Jakes also announced plans to speed up some of the modest economic
reforms the conservative Prague leadership has adopted to try to
stimulate the economy.
   He also said there would be a limit of two five-year terms for
the party leader and three successive terms for regional party
officials.
   In addition, Jakes said, party officials should not accumulate
too many functions and should be elected by secret ballot.
   He stressed, however, that the Communist Party must retain its
powerful role as the leading force of Czechoslovak society, saying
that the party must strengthen its ``influence on what is happening
in society.''
   ``In no case can party work be narrowed to mere educational
activity,'' he stressed.
   In his 57-page speech, published by the state news agency CTK,
Jakes accused unidentified ``hostile propaganda'' abroad of
preparing ``a slanderous campaign'' connected to the 20th
anniversary of the failed Prague Spring reforms of former Communist
party leader Alexander Dubcek.
   He also accused unidentified Western media of fomenting unrest,
particularly among religious believers, who have recently staged
two unusual demonstrations calling for religious freedom.
   Almost 500,000 Roman Catholics have signed an unprecedented
petition for more freedom to practice religion.
   ``Recently, we have been witnessing how anti-Communist forces
try, with the assistance of some Western media, directly to
organize the creation of opposition groups, incite them toward
actions which are to create unrest and tension in our society and
even hide this behind religious motivation,'' Jakes said.
   ``We have to reject these efforts resolutely,'' he added. ``In
our state, all believers can enjoy religious freedoms ... and take
part in religious life and rites.''
   ``Do not let us overrate or underrate the endeavors of the
enemies,'' Jakes went on. ``We have considered this in the
(Politburo) ... we shall not permit anybody to parasite on the
process of restructuring and democratization.
   ``The laws of the state are valid for all and those who violate
them must count on legal consequences.''
   Jakes' words signaled that opposition groups will not be
included in any immediate dialogue with the Communist authorities,
as has been hinted at in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union.
   Turning to the economy, Jakes noted that performance had
improved in the first quarter of this year, but that almost one in
five state-run enterprises is performing below target.
   He said a new law on enterprises which decentralizes their
management will come into force July 1 this year, and not next
January as originally announced, and also spoke vaguely of plans to
trim the central bureaucracy.
   Later this month, according to informed sources, parliament will
approve the merger of four technical ministries into a ``super
ministry'' of engineering, headed by 51-year-old technocrat
Ladislav Gerle.
   Social welfare and health ministries, transport and
communications ministries and the ministries running agriculture,
water and forestry are also likely to be merged.
   It is estimated that 30,000 to 50,000 bureaucrats will lose
their jobs.

<HEAD>Personal Debt Grows Strongly for Third Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans took out $5.3 billion more in
installment debt than they paid off in February for the third
consecutive strong monthly gain, the government said Friday in a
report that provided further evidence that consumers have not
stopped spending.
   The Federal Reserve said consumer debt increased at an annual
rate of 10.3 percent in February, down slightly from the 12.2
percent rate of growth in January. In that month, installment debt
had risen by $6.24 billion following a December increase of $4.3
billion.
   Analysts credited the big increases to strong auto sales.
Domestic automakers reported earlier this week that they had their
best January-March sales period since 1985, gains that were helped
by incentive programs.
   This strong consumer demand has eased fears that the October
collapse of the stock market would frighten Americans into slowing
spending so much that the country could be faced with a recession
this year.
   ``We are seeing a stronger first quarter than we had initially
expected. One of the favorable developments is the final round of
tax cuts consumers are getting because of the 1986 tax law,'' said
Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Wasington-based Futures Group.
   Consumer spending is crucial to the country's economic health
because it accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity.
Consumer spending grew 1.9 percent last year, after adjusting for
inflation, and Ms. Shaber said she is looking for similar moderate
growth this year.
   She said this forecast could be jeopardized if interest rates
start rising significantly, boosting the costs of credit purchases.
   Rates have been rising in recent weeks as the Federal Reserve
has apparently tightened up slightly on credit to keep the economy
from overheating. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said
fixed-rate mortgages rose in the current week to 10.19 percent from
10.05 percent last week.
   In February, the credit report said, auto loans rose by $3.31
billion, a 14.7 percent annual rate of increase, after rising by
$2.7 billion in January.
   The category that includes credit card debt rose by $1.49
billion in Febuary, down from a January increase of $2.76 billion.
   The debt category that includes loans from banks and credit
unions not secured by real estate edged up $564 million in February
after a small gain of $807 million in January.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at $619.2 billion
at the end of February, an increase of 8.9 percent from a year
earlier.

<HEAD>Residents of Leningrad Helped Dry Books After Disastrous Fire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of Leningrad helped dry books in
their homes after a fire at the Leningrad library founded by Peter
the Great, according to an expert helping the Soviets cope with the
disaster.
   ``This was the biggest disaster in modern history to a
library,'' Sally Buchanan said Friday. ``This material was valuable
to not only Soviet scholars, but scholars from all over the world.''
   The Feb. 14 fire damaged or destroyed an estimated 4 million
books at the U.S.S.R. National Academy of Sciences, founded in
1714, said Ms. Buchanan, one of three U.S. experts who helped the
Soviets begin restoration.
   Many books suffered water damage, and the library called on
residents for help, handing out wet books with instructions for
drying them, Ms. Buchanan said. Not one was stolen, she said.
   ``Many of these books were rare books and they all came back
beautifully dried,'' she said. ``They ended up drying something
like half a million books.''
   The Soviet Union's state cultural fund chairman, Dmitri
Likhachev, has accused Communist Party officials of trying to
conceal the extent of the damage and of using bulldozers to clear
away piles of damaged books.
   Library officials in Leningrad have said those charges are
false, and Ms. Buchanan said she ``saw no indication that the
library had tried to cover up the fire. The library was very candid
about what the losses were.''
   Ms. Buchanan, assistant director of preservation at the
University of Pittsburgh's Hillman Library, said flames destroyed
an estimated 400,000 books and damaged 3.6 million more, including
17th-century scientific collections, Ms. Buchanan said.
   Soviet librarians are still assessing the damage and exact
losses won't be known for at least another month, Ms. Buchanan
said, but some of the burned books, particularly those concerning
science history, were probably the only ones in existence.
   The library, in a 1920s building, contained more than 12 million
books, manuscripts and periodicals.
   ``The only way this library is going to recover from this is
with help from the international library community to replace the
materials that have been lost,'' she said.
   Ms. Buchanan has led restoration efforts in several library
disasters, including a fire at a Los Angeles library two years ago.
She and the other two U.S. experts have been invited to return to
Leningrad within the next year.

   Key lime pie may well join the porpoise
and the largemouth bass on the somewhat lengthy list of what the
Legislature considers official.
   At the suggestion of a constituent, state Rep. Norman Ostrau is
planning to sponsor a bill for an official state pie.
   ``It encompasses everything that's Florida,'' said Bob Roth, who
proposed the bill to Ostrau. Roth's wife, Terry, makes the tart pie
as part of the family's citrus business in Davie.
   Key limes, small and yellowish, are indigenous to south Florida,
but the pies also are made with the more familiar dark green
varities.
   Previous legislatures have designated the porpoise the state
mammal and the manatee as its marine mammal. The largemouth bass is
the state freshwater fish and the sailfish its saltwater fish.
Agatized coral is the state stone, and ``The Cross and Sword,''
which tells the story of the Spanish colonization of St. Augustine,
is the official state play.
   To date, orange juice _ the official state beverage _ is the
only food item on the list.

   A pheasant egg hunt for Chinese children is being
planned by biologists from Michigan's Department of Natural
Resources.
   They hope to retrieve eggs from China's Szechwan province to
bolster and perhaps supplant the state's ringneck pheasant
population, which has declined drastically the past two decades.
   Biologists think the Szechwan pheasants are better adapted to
survival on the brushy, rural terrain of southern Michigan.
   ``The children are looking for them anyway, because they eat
them, or feed them to their dogs or sometimes just smash the eggs
and nests, because they don't like pheasants because they eat their
crops,'' said DNR biologist Peter Squibb, head of the program to
rebuild the pheasant flock.
   The children will be paid about 25 cents for each egg. DNR
officials hope to return with 2,000 eggs, half of which are
expected to hatch successfully and lead to a population of 2
million to 3 million birds in the 1990s.

   At the urging of a kidnap victim, a
judge has sentenced the two men who pleaded guilty to the abduction
to prisons where they can get help with their crack cocaine
addictions.
   Annie V. Brown, 53, was kidnapped March 3 by two men who bound
her with electrical cord and gagged her with a sock, then forced
her into the trunk of her car while they drove around for three
hours.
   After she was let out, she grabbed a gun that had been concealed
in the car and held one of them until police arrived.
   ``The thing that amazed me about her was that she still had
compassion for these people. You'd think that somebody tied up in
the trunk for three hours would have wanted them sentenced to as
long as she could,'' Assistant State Attorney Refik Eler said.
``She seemed to feel it was more important that they be helped. A
lot of victims that I see will just say `Fry 'em.'''
   He noted that her compassion is even more remarkable since her
daughter was murdered in 1980, leaving her to raise her
grandchildren.
   ``I feel compassion for them because they're young men,'' Mrs.
Brown said Thursday after sentencing.
   Samuel Alexander, 21, and Donald G. Alexander, 24, not related,
admitted Thursday that they kidnapped Mrs. Brown.
   Mrs. Brown asked Circuit Judge Hudson R. Olliff to give them a
second chance and urged that they be sent to a prison where they
could rehabilitate themselves.
   Each could have received up to nine years, but Olliff imposed
less-than-maximum terms.
   In addition to the kidnapping, Samuel Alexander also pleaded
guilty to a charge of grand theft for stealing Mrs. Brown's car. He
was given six years in prison. Donald Alexander pleaded guilty to
an additional charge of armed robbery and was sentenced to 5{ years.
   Olliff said he will ask that Samuel Alexander be placed in a
youthful offender facility where he can learn a trade. Officials
will be asked to place Donald Alexander, a former University of
Florida student and Army veteran, in a prison where he can get drug
counseling.
   The two men visited Mrs. Brown on March 3 and Donald Alexander,
a friend of two of Mrs. Brown's children, asked her to write a
letter of reference for him to get a job.
   When she turned to go into her house, she was grabbed by Donald
Alexander, who demanded all her money. At the same time, Samuel
Alexander tied her hands.
   ``At this time, I was sure they were going to kill me,'' said
Mrs. Brown, who told the men where she had $20 hidden. They got the
money, then took her out to her car and put her in the trunk.
   The men finally stopped, and Donald Alexander opened the trunk
and said he would free her if she would write him a check.
   ``I said `You have to give me the keys so I can get a pen out of
the glove compartment,''' Mrs. Brown said. While she opened the
glove compartment, she grabbed a .22-caliber pistol she kept hidden
under the front seat.
   She held Donald Alexander at gunpoint until police arrived.
Samuel Alexander fled but turned himself in the next day.

   Former first lady Betty Ford, still
recovering from heart bypass surgery last year, was celebrating her
70th birthday Friday with a small party, her secretary said.
   ``Her husband is giving a party for her this evening with a few
friends and family,'' Ann Cullen said.
   Mrs. Ford underwent bypass surgery in November, but returned to
the hospital in December because of bleeding complications. She was
released from Eisenhower Medical Center on Jan. 3.
   ``She is feeling very well, taking things a little slowly but
pretty much back to normal,'' Ms. Cullen said.
   Ms. Cullen said Mrs. Ford planned to spend Friday ``sitting at
her desk, working on the day-to-day operation of the Betty Ford
Center,'' a drug and alcohol dependency clinic she founded in 1982.
   She did not know what former President Gerald Ford planned to
give his wife for her birthday.

   A hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet carrying 55
people landed in Larnaca, Cyprus, today after the Beirut and
Damascus airports refused to let it land and the captain said he
was running out of fuel.
   ``I'll never forget this, thank you,'' the captain shouted into
the radio after Larnaca Airport air traffic controllers told him he
was cleared to land.
   The blue and white Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 touched down at at
9:10 p.m. (2:10 p.m. EDT) after Damascus Airport in Syria refused
to let it land and Beirut airport officials said it would be fired
on if it landed in Beirut.
   Larnaca Airport authorities said a ``state of emergency'' was
declared as the plane made its final approach to land at the
facility after nighfall.
   The jetliner left Mashhad airport in northeastern Iran at 2:28
p.m. (6:58 a.m. EDT) after the Arab hijackers threatened to blow it
up. It was hijacked Tuesday on a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait and
forced to land at Mashhad.
   The aircraft parked at the end of Larnaca airport's single
runway. A few minutes later the captain, in a calm voice, requested
fuel, but did not say if the hijackers wanted to take off again.
   The hijackers were demanding the release of 17 pro-Iranian
terrorists jailed in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French
embassies there in 1983.
   Earlier, the pilot pleaded with the Beirut International Airport
control tower to be allowed to land.
   ``A gun is pointed to my head. I request landing permission to
land to refuel,'' the captain was overheard shouting through the
jet's radio at 5:25 p.m. (11:25 a.m. EDT).
   ``We have been for 14 years under gunfire,'' an airport official
replied, referring to Lebanon's civil war. ``If you try to land by
force, the plane will be fired on.''
   According to sources monitoring radio traffic, a man speaking in
Arabic with an east Lebanon accent came to the radio and asked that
controllers put him in touch with Lebanese officials.
   But Interior Minister Abdulla Rassi, in a statement broadcast by
the official media, again refused to allow the plane to land.
   A hijacker then said: ``I shall punish control tower officials
if they don't allow us to land. The passengers are all in panic now
and many of them are vomiting. Among the passengers is a member of
the Kuwaiti ruling family who has a heart condition.''
   A control tower official in Beirut radioed back saying: ``With
all due respect to all families, permit me to say that all the
Lebanese suffer heart ailments (from the war). Do not try to talk
to me sentimentally.''
   Three members of Kuwait's Al-Sabah royal family were aboard the
plane.
   One of them, a woman identified as Anware Khaled Al-Sabah, told
the control tower in a choking voice: ``I beg you. Allow us to
land. We have no fuel left.''
   Later, sources said, the pilot radioed back and said, ``If you
fail to clear the runways within a few minutes, we will land in the
sea.'' The sources monitoring the conversation spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   ``Do whatever you want,'' the controller said. ``Crash on the
tarmac or in the sea. ... We shall not let you land here.''
   The pilot had reported at 10:30 a.m. EDT that he had enough fuel
for three hours.
   A Beirut control tower official told The Associated Press that
fire engines and passenger buses of Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's
flag carrier, were parked on the airport's two runways to block the
plane from landing.
   Syrian troops, who control the airport, blocked all roads to the
airport on Beirut's southern edge.
   The gunmen _ believed to number about six _ released 57
passengers since Tuesday.
   All the remaining hostages aboard the plane were believed to be
Arabs, including more than 30 Kuwaitis. One passenger was believed
to hold both U.S. and Egyptian passports.
   Before Iranian workers removed obstacles to takeoff in Mashhad,
the hijackers brought a man to the top of the stairway and fired
three warning shots, then tossed a grenade out the door, IRNA said.
It did not say whether it exploded.
   The captain was quoted as saying a passenger was forced into the
cockpit and beaten, IRNA reported.
   It said the captain gave that report after being queried about a
wail of pain heard over control-tower radio. It was not clear
whether the man shown in the stairway was the beaten passenger.
   After the hijackers released some of the hostages on Thursday,
the jet was refueled, but only after the hijackers fired five shots
at security men, IRNA reported.
   The 57 released hostages arrived in Kuwait aboard a Kuwait
Airways plane that picked them up in Mashhad.
   They appeared tired and dazed. They were taken to another area
in the airport and did not speak to reporters there.
   One, Irishman Kieran O'Kelly, was quoted in the Times of London
as saying, ``The hijackers are very determined young men who are
quite willing to die. I am concerned for the safety of the hostages
left on board.''

<HEAD>Official Presidential Election Campaign Opens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The presidential campaign opened Friday, a race
with few new faces and fewer new ideas that has evolved into a
battle of personalities among the three major candidates.
   President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist seeking a second
seven-year term, continues to hold a wide lead in public opinion
polls over conservative Premier Jacques Chirac, 55, and former
center-right Premier Raymond Barre, 63.
   The other six candidates in the race stand little chance of
accomplishing more than using the election to expound their ideas,
ranging from radical left to extreme right.
   Mitterrand, 71, will have no trouble winning the most votes in
the April 24 first round, though he is likely to fall considerably
short of an absolute majority. The real contest is between Chirac
and Barre for the No. 2 spot and the right to face the incumbent in
the May 8 runoff.
   Chirac is the favorite in the battle for second place and has
been increasing his lead over Barre.
   The polls show Mitterrand defeating either Chirac or Barre by as
much as 55 percent. The conservatives are pinning their hopes on
the large number of people who are undecided.
   In contrast to the 1981 presidential election, which featured a
clear ideological choice between Socialism and free-market
liberalism, the traditional cleavage has disappeared.
   Mitterrand, who founded the modern Socialist Party and led it
for a decade, did not once mention the words Socialist or Socialism
in his 25-page ``letter to the French'' this week, setting out his
platform.
   Chirac, the standard-bearer of the Gaullist tradition, also has
``rounded off his corners.'' In a TV interview Thursday night, he
said he wanted to enlarge the composition of his Cabinet beyond his
own political camp and admitted agreement with Mitterrand on some
subjects, such as defense and foreign policy.
   The platforms of the three major candidates all focus on the
same themes, differences being largely a matter of nuance.
   All three say they are for the development of a unified Europe
and that France must be prepared for 1992 when the last trade
barriers come down in the European Economic Community. All stress
reforms in education as a key to reducing France's 10.4 percent
unemployment. And all recognize the need to spur technological
research to improve economic competitivity.
   Both Socialists and conservatives admit there is no quick
solution to unemployment, the overriding issue of 1981. The
programs of all three focus more on general orientations and less
on specific measures.
   The differences between Chirac and Barre are even narrower, a
difficult subject for the uninitiated.
   The presidential campaign effectively began in March 1986, when
Chirac's conservatives ousted the Socialists from control of the
National Assembly. That created what the French call
``cohabitation'' between a leftist president and a rightist
government _ a unique situation in the history of the Fifth
Republic.
   The official campaign that began Friday means the final list of
nine candidates has been published. It also means that from now
until the elections, radio and television time is strictly
rationed, with each candidate receiving the same amount of time.
   Also, law prohibits the publication of any opinion polls in the
week immediately preceding the election.
   Lacking clear-cut ideological differences and innovative ideas,
the race has evolved into a beauty contest among the major
candidates.
   On one side is Mitterrand, once the most unpopular president of
the Fifth Republic with poll ratings now soaring to be seen as the
sage, lovable ``uncle.''
   On the other is Chirac, the hard-driving bulldozer, workaholic,
avid campaigner and flesh-presser in his second tour as premier. He
contrasts with Barre, the heavyset economics professor of
intellectual brilliance but distant, somewhat cold personality.
   Chirac accused Mitterrand of having a vague program and said he
was asking the French to elect him now and see what he does later.
   ``One doesn't win a battle by idly dreaming at the fireside, one
doesn't engage the future in warming his slippers,'' Chirac said.
   Barre says Mitterrand's program has three characteristics,
``obvious immobilism, masked Socialism and constant imprecision,''
and his goal ``is to remain in place, and from that moment
everything will be fine in the best of Frances.''
   Mitterrand says the right lacks heart and accuses it of
unconcern for social justice.
   Rounding out the field of candidates are Jean-Marie Le Pen, 59,
leader of the extreme right National Front; Andre Lajoinie, 58, the
official Communist Party candidate; Pierre Juquin, 58, head of a
splinter Communist group; Antoine Waechter, 39, ecologist; Arlette
Laguiller, 48, a Trotskyist; and Pierre Boussel, 67, another
extreme left Trotskyist.

<BYLINE>Khomeini Leads Iranians To Polls Despite Missiles
^By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranians chanting ``War, war until
victory!'' defied threats of Iraqi missile attacks Friday and voted
for a new parliament after being urged to go to the polls by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Iran's state-run television showed Khomeini, 87 and reported in
poor health, voting in the morning chill at an open-air polling
station near his home in the northern Tehran suburb of Jamaran.
   Khomeini was one of the first to cast ballots when the country's
30,000 polling stations opened for 12 hours. Later, the government
extended polling hours until 10 p.m. because many people were still
voting.
   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, surrounded by Iranians chanting
``We're not tired of the war!'' voted early.
   The official media said the turnout among Iran's 20-25 million
voters was ``massive,'' but it gave no figures. Khomeini had called
on his followers to turn out in force to defy the Iraqis.
   The results may take up to 10 days to be announced.
   Polling stations in Tehran were crowded, although as many as
half the capital's 6 million people have fled the city to escape
Iraqi missile attacks.
   Tehran Radio reported that one missile crashed into the capital
before dawn and that the cities of Isfahan, Qom and Tabriz were
also hit. No details were given.
   Iranian leaders had feared the Iraqis would launch a massive
bombardment to disupt the election.
   Musavi told Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency that
the turnout was ``wonderful, a sign of the people's fierce
resistance.''
   It was the third parliamentary election since Khomeini's 1979
Islamic revolution toppled the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. The
last was in 1984. The new parliament will be vital in determining
the future of the revolution and in choosing a new leader when
Khomeni dies.
   At stake were all 270 seats in Iran's Majlis, or parliament.
There were more than 1,400 candidates, including women for the
first time. Parliament members are elected to four-year terms.
   One voter said he came to Tehran from Amol, about 120 miles to
the north, to show that he was ``not scared.''
   ``I decided to vote here after they said Tehran would be the
target for many missiles,'' he said. He declined to give his name.
   Anyone over 16 years old was entitled to vote, provided they
produced photo identity cards.
   Analysts predicted the new parliament would be dominated by
radicals who would give the government a broader mandate for
reforms that have been blocked by the conservatives.
   The radicals favor a planned, socialist-style economy with price
controls and stringent enforcement of tax laws.
   Conservative-leaning clerics made up only 20 percent of the
candidates.
   People filled out their ballots openly. Voters did not seem to
care if others saw whom they voted for.
   One man had his form filled out by a neighbor.
   The 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war, the country's most pressing
problem, has not figured in the campaigning. Khomeini, Iran's
undisputed patriarch, has decreed that the war will not end until
his adversary, Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, has been toppled.
   The campaign dealt mainly with economic issues.
   In his pre-election message, Khomeini underscored his recent
tilt to the left by urging voters not to back candidates ``who
advocated a brand of Islam supported by the capitalists'' but those
pledged to ``help the downtrodden.''
   House Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, one of Khomeini's closest
aides and considered a pragmatist on most issues, was expected to
be reelected along with most of the leading figures in the hierachy.
   But the hardliners, such Musavi, were expected to make some
gains, a development that could have far-reaching effects on the
shape of the revolution in the post-Khomeini era.

<HEAD>Battle for 150-Year-old Pecan Tree Over; Big Ike to Be Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORINTH, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battle to save Big Ike has failed, but
the memory of the 150-year-old pecan tree is going to be preserved
in furniture and mementos and by a party.
   The tree, said to be the fifth- or sixth-largest of its kind in
the world, isn't likely to survive a move from the path of a
highway expansion, so it's going to be cut down.
   Dewayne Davis, of Richmond, Va., who has been working to save
the tree, says he will begin negotiations with the Mississippi
Highway Department to have the tree removed in late fall.
   Big Ike stands three miles south of Corinth on a farm Davis
inherited from his grandfather.
   The decision to cut down the tree was made this week after
forestry and horticulture experts from Mississippi State University
completed tests that indicate the tree could not survive being
uprooted and moved.
   So the tree will be used to make a piece of furniture for the
governor's mansion and to make small wooden crosses that will be
given to the 100 children who have become members of the Big Ike
Bunch, Davis said.
   The horticulture experts also will try to make grafts of the
pecan tree, which Davis plans to plant near where Big Ike now
stands.
   And Davis is planning a party _ with hot dogs and lemonade _ in
late November.
   ``We have much to celebrate,'' he said. ``It was a unified
effort that brought the Big Ike Bunch together.''

   Fawn Hall, who made her television debut
testifying about former boss Oliver North before a Senate
committee, will be co-host of a network special its producers hope
is an upscale version of ``The Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.''
   Miss Hall was chosen ``because she is very spontaneous and has a
presence that is indicative she can handle this kind of assignment
with zest and energy,'' Gary Pudney, an ABC television vice
president for specials, said Friday.
   ``M-W Men and Women,'' based upon M and W magazines, will air
the first week in June. Pudney said it is to combine
``Entertainment Tonight,'' ``60 Minutes'' and an upscale version of
the show that displays the opulent lifestyles of the wealthy.
   The other co-hosts are Ron Reagan, the president's son; actress
Jane Seymour; and Danny Sullivan, the cab-driving Indianapolis 500
winner.
   Miss Seymour will be dressed by the newest fashion darling,
French designer Christian Lacroix, as she interviews him. Reagan
will introduce what's in and out, and Sullivan will flash by with
stars and their cars.
   Miss Hall already has taped her segment for the hourlong show _
an interview with a British heiress who gave it all up to live with
her husband, a Masai warrior, outside of Nairobi, Kenya, in East
Africa.
   ``My understanding is it looks just terrific and we're
encouraged by what we hear about Miss Hall's abilities and
encouraged there might be additional opporturnties for her,''
Pudney said.
   ``I think she was picked because of her natural ability to do
this assignment'' although ``I wouldn't have known about her'' if
Miss Hall had not appeared before a Senate committee investigating
the Iran-Contra affair and North's role in it.

<TEXT>
   A 98-year-old woman who moved to the
United States in 1927 on Friday became the first person to gain
citizenship under the amnesty program allowing aliens to legalize
their status.
   ``It seems like it is not true,'' Clara Escobedo de Martinez
said in Spanish after the ceremony. ``It is so big, it seems like a
fairy tale.''
   The widow and great-grandmother sat in a chair, raised her hand
and took the oath of allegiance to the United States in Spanish
from U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela.
   ``What you're doing today, Dona Clarita, very much is a heroic
event,'' said Vela.
   A case of overnight nerves sapped some of her strength, Mrs.
Escobedo said. But after it was over she felt strong enough to wave
a flag provided by the local chapter of the Daughters of the
American Revolution.
   A cake inscribed ``Congratulations Citizen Clara'' and a special
luncheon held by the Immigration and Naturalization Service awaited
her at the Fort Brown Motor Hotel about a quarter-mile from the
Mexican border.
   INS district director Jerry Sewell said the reception was his
agency's way of thanking Mrs. Escobedo for being a public relations
agent for the one-year amnesty program ending May 4.
   Mrs. Escobedo appeared on parade floats and television
commercials and helped motivate other aliens to apply under the
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 offering legal residency
and ultimately citizenship to those able to prove they have lived
here illegally since before 1982.
   ``She is the first person in the United States who applied for
amnesty to become a citizen,'' Sewell said.
   She is not the oldest person to apply for amnesty under the
program; that distinction apparently goes to Carlos Romero-Gaitan
of Los Angeles, a 101-year-old Mexican who was smuggled into the
country in the back seat of his son's car 14 years ago.
   Joining Mrs. Escobedo in becoming citizens Friday were a
74-year-old daughter, Consuelo Martinez Zarate, and two
granddaughters, 47-year-old Rakel Zarate and 44-year-old Genoveva
Zarate de Sanchez.
   ``It has given me new dimensions of my love for this country,''
said Rakel Zarate.
   Mrs. Escobedo, who said her husband was killed by Pancho Villa's
men during the Mexican revolution, lived in the United States
legally from 1927 until 1962.
   But in a bureaucratic mix-up, immigration officials took away
her ``green'' card _ which is now blue and shows legal residency
status _ because they thought she had been living in Matamoros,
Mexico, in violation of the card's terms.
   She has lived as an undocumented alien with relatives in
Brownsville since 1979.
   Officials gave her a new green card in February and were able to
waive the normal five-year wait for citizenship because she
satisfied that requirement 56 years ago, in 1932, said Sewell.
   Otherwise she would have had to wait until 1994, when she would
have been 104.
   Mrs. Escobedo said she had always planned to become a citizen
during her first 35 years in this country, but kept putting it off.
   She never learned to speak English, but the requirement does not
apply to applicants over age 50 with more than 20 years of U.S.
residency.
   She learned how to say at least one English word on Friday.
   ``Citifen? Citipen?'' Mrs. Escobedo said haltingly under her
daughter's coaching.
   ``I am American citizen,'' she finally said, with a broad smile.

   Negotiations on an Afghanistan settlement were
completed Friday, allowing the Soviet Union to pull out of a war
with Moslem guerrillas to which it had committed a force of 115,000
soldiers.
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez said he expects the five-point
peace plan to be signed by next Thursday. The signing will end
nearly six years of indirect talks in which he was the go-between
for Afghanistan and its eastern neighbor, Pakistan.
   A U.N. spokeswoman, Therese Gastaut, said the date of the
signing ceremony will be announced Monday.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev confirmed that Soviet troops
will begin leaving on May 15, but added the withdrawal is not ``a
present to President Reagan.'' The two begin their fourth summit
May 29 in Moscow.
   Although Cordovez has a mandate from all sides to promote
dialogue within Communist-ruled Afghanistan, there is no guarantee
the 10-year-old war will stop.
   The U.S.-supported insurgent alliance was not included in the
negotiations and issued a statement Friday saying its fighters
``will not be bound by the outcome of the Geneva agreements and
they will continue the war as long as the Russians and their
puppets are present in Afghanistan.''
   In a statement approved by all sides, Cordovez stressed that
``any questions relating to the government in Afghanistan'' are an
internal matter.
   ``We have discussed, we have negotiated. That's over,'' he told
reporters. ``The documents are now finalized and open for
signature.''
   He called the settlement a ``historic opportunity'' for
Afghanistan.
   Agreement became possible after what diplomatic sources said was
a secret understanding that Washington will phase out aid to the
guerrillas while Moscuw cuts off military support to Kabul.
   Cordovez said all parties are ready to sign, including the
Soviet Union and United States as guarantors, after a final round
of negotiations that lasted more than five weeks.
   The agreement covers Afghan and Pakistani assurances of
non-interference in each other's affairs, safe and voluntary return
of Afghan refugees, and superpower guarantees. A fourth part ties
the others together and Cordovez said a memorandum of understanding
was added on the U.N. role in supervising the agreement.
   Texts are to be published later.
   Moslem insurgents began fighting after a Communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in December
1979.
   Pakistan represented the guerrillas in Geneva and delivers
supplies to them, including highly effective U.S. Stinger
anti-aircraft missiles. About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live in
Pakistan, most in border cities and camps that serve as bases and
supply points for the insurgents.
   The United States had said it would not sign the U.N. accord
until the Soviets agreed to ``symmetry'' _ a simultaneous end to
military aid on both sides.
   Diplomatic sources called the informal agreement on ending
outside aid a face-saving solution for both sides. Cordovez said it
was not part of the U.N. settlement.
   A senior U.S. diplomat in Moscow said the deal was made through
behind-the-scenes diplomacy.
   In a clear allusion to the question of outside military aid,
Cordovez said he was convinced all parties ``will exercise
restraint in taking any actions'' that might violate the letter and
spirit of the accord.
   ``The agreement is designed to bring peace to Afghanistan and
the conditions for such a peace would not be obtained if actions
are taken which would fuel hostilities,'' he said.
   Intense Soviet diplomatic activity this week preceded the
agreement.
   Gorbachev met Najib, the Afghan leader, in the Soviet Central
Asian city of Tashkent earlier this week and they issued a joint
statement Thursday saying all issues had been resolved.
   Yuli Vorontsov, deputy Soviet foreign minister, flew to Geneva
to meet the Afghan foreign minister, Abdul Wakil, apparently
because Afghanistan had been holding out over a border dispute with
Pakistan.
   The dispute, dating to 1893, had provoked arguments over the
U.N. settlement's reference to boundaries. A source close to the
talks said it was resolved on Friday.
   Early last month, Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed on completion
of the Soviet troop pullout in nine months, with half leaving in
the first three months. The timetable had been a major sticking
point.

<HEAD>$121 Grocery Trip Turns Into $80 Million Error</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No matter how many steaks Carol Armstrong
placed in her shopping cart, her husband knew the grocery trip did
not cost what their bank said she spent _ $80 million.
   ``I was a little surprised. I knew it was a mistake,'' Richard
Armstrong, 41, said Friday.
   An shopping trip March 23 to a supermarket cost $121.78, which
Mrs. Armstrong paid with an automated teller card from Wells Fargo
Bank. But a bank error added $80 million more.
   Armstrong, an electronics technician, said he realized something
was wrong several days later when he couldn't withdraw money from
their account. He tried unsuccessfully several times, then called
up his balance on the machine.
   ``This huge number with a minus sign comes spilling out,''
Armstrong said.
   Since the automated teller only goes up to $1 million, the
machine showed his account overdrawn for that amount.
   Despite this shock, Armstrong wanted to buy some flags and went
to a flag store. ``I said, `I think I'm a million dollars short, so
can I write a check?'''
   Since the owner knew him, Armstrong was allowed to write a check.
   He then called his bank, which, he said, insisted the Armstrongs
had mistakenly written a check for $80 million. He noted, however,
that $80,000,121.78 had been deducted from their account and
finally deduced that the mistake stemmed from the check for
groceries.
   Still, Armstrong was left without money over Easter weekend.
   ``I had to rob my kid's piggy banks,'' he said.
   Wells Fargo corrected the Armstrongs' balance Tuesday. A bank
spokeswoman said it was a clerical error.

<HEAD>Dukakis: ``I'd Wage A Real War, Not A Phony War, On Drugs''</HEAD>

   A tough stand on drugs was the main
theme Friday as Michael Dukakis, his presidential hopes buoyed by a
new poll, campaigned in the Long Island suburbs of New York City.
   Asked at a senior citizens forum what he would do to protect the
elderly from criminals, the Massachusetts governor quickly turned
his answer to drugs. ``I'd wage a real war, not a phony war, on
drugs,'' he said, drawing loud applause. ``We've got to get tough
on the flow of drugs into this country.''
   An earlier speech at St. John's University, billed as a major
foreign policy address, also emphasized the need to deal with drug
trafficking.
   ``In Latin America, the gravest threat to our security comes not
from the Sandinistas, but from drugs,'' he said.
   In the three-way Democratic race for the 255 delegates at stake
in the New York primary on April 19, Dukakis held a growing lead in
a new poll by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion.
   The survey of 404 likely Democratic voters found 47 percent
naming Dukakis as their presidential choice, while 31 percent
picked Jesse Jackson and 6 percent Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee.
   The interviews were conducted Tuesday and Wednesday and the poll
had a margin of error of 5 percent, meaning the figures could be
off by 5 points up or down.
   A Marist poll taken less than a month ago reported Dukakis was
the choice of 37 percent of likely Democratic primary voters while
Jackson had 28 percent.
   At the senior citizens forum held at Adelphi University, Dukakis
said he was opposed to means testing for Social Security and said
that two-thirds of the people receiving the federal retirement
benefits had no other income.
   At St. John's, Dukakis advocated using a portion of foreign aid
for drug enforcement programs in producing countries.
   He also criticized the Reagan administration's ties to Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama.
   ``The American people deserve a full explanation of what and why
we were doing business with Noriega,'' he said.
   On the Persian Gulf, Dukakis said the United States should
``challenge China and the Soviet Union to join the agreement
recently signed by Japan and the Western powers to stop the sale of
long-range missiles to all countries in the Middle East.''
   He said the United States also ``must enlist every nation we can
in the effort to ban poison gas, something that is being used right
now, right now, and to impose tough sanctions against any country
dumb enough and savage enough to use these weapons against their
fellow human beings.''

   Clutching sack lunches
along with their rifles and machine guns, 290 Marines boarded giant
cargo jets and flew to Panama on Friday for jungle training
exercises.
   The Marines joked among themselves, listened to a Dixieland jazz
band and waved to Mom as they passed in front of television cameras
before boarding two C-141 jets that took off before noon.
   ``I'm just going down to get a suntan,'' said Cpl. Mark
Stelluto, 21, a radio operator from Fullerton. ``We have been told
to be on our best demeanor.''
   The Marines, dressed in camouflage and carrying M-16 rifles,
M-60 machine guns and other weapons, are members of the 2nd
Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment, and the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine
Regiment, based at Camp Pendleton, 60 miles north of San Diego.
   The exercise is unrelated to a U.S. military buildup prompted by
Panama's current political turmoil, said Lt. Gene Browne, a Camp
Pendleton spokesman. Five hundred more Marines leave next week for
the training, he said.
   The last of 1,300 other U.S. troops arrived Thursday at Howard
Air Force Base outside Panama City, completing a buildup meant to
provide greater security for the Panama Canal, American
installations and U.S. citizens.
   ``This whole thing for us is purely coincidental,'' said Browne.
``This particular training evolution has been scheduled since
December.''
   ``We don't have jungles in Southern California and they do down
there at the Army school so we go there to train,'' he said.
   The government-controlled press in Panama contends the Marines'
arrival is a step toward a U.S. invasion aimed at ousting Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega, head of the 15,000-member Panamanian Defense forces,
refused to step down when fired by the country's civilian
president, who then went into hiding. Noriega has been indicted in
the United States on drug charges, and the Reagan administration
has been trying to oust him with economic pressure.
   The arrival of the 800 Marines will bring to more than 12,000
the number of U.S. military personnel in the Central American
country.
   The Marines leaving Friday range in age from 18 to 45, and while
few have combat experience, executive officer Brad Stephan said
they were prepared to fight if necessary.
   Said Lance Cpl. Rodolfo Gonzalez, 21: ``I'm looking forward to
it. I've never been down there.'' He said his biggest worry was
getting sick from the food.
   Nicaraugan-born Juan Chamorro dropped one of his weapons as he
boarded the plane. His penalty, several push-ups, was imposed
immediately; he did the exercises with his feet on the boarding
ramp and his hands on the ground.
   When asked if he was nervous, Stelluto said: ``No. It will be
hard enough just to deal with the insects and frogs and the things
in the jungle like that as it is.''

<HEAD>Bush: Democrats Will Get Act Together Before Fall Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush looked ahead
to the fall presidential campaign on Friday and said he didn't
expect the Democrats ``to hemorrhage to death'' despite their
hard-fought campaign.
   Bush, on his first political trip since Bob Dole quit the race
and Pat Robertson scaled back his effort, was asked by reporters if
he minded not having the discipline of a primary race.
   ``I'm delighted it's worked out the way it has. You offset
staying in the news through combat by the luxury that comes with
having the time to deal with issues. I wouldn't trade, let's put it
that way,'' he said.
   ``I wish I thought the Democrats would have a unity problem but
I don't think they will. I'm not counting on the blood on the floor
that exists on this moment to carry over and cause the Democrats to
hemorrhage to death,'' he said.
   Bush toured an aircraft assembly plant and climbed into the
cockpit of a General Dynamics F-16 fighter jet and planned to
attend several fund-raisers during his two-day swing through Texas
and Florida.
   Bush said he had no intention of making an early selection of a
running mate. ``I'm not in the mode of picking or even going
through the elementary selection process,'' Bush said.
   He said there had been ``a lot of plain manila envelopes ... a
lot of speculation'' on a possible vice presidential choice. ``None
of it is authorized by me,'' Bush added.
   Bush reiterated that he would not publicly make a recommendation
to Attorney General Edwin Meese over whether Meese should resign
because of his current legal difficulties. However, Bush said that
he would ``adhere to and advocate the highest possible ethical
standards'' if elected president.
   ``I'm not going to get into the Meese matter. I want to keep
talking about high standards,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>South Korea's ``Peace Dam'' Nears Completion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>Hwachun, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first phase of a huge dam
designed to prevent North Korea from flooding out the Olympic Games
in Seoul neared completion Friday on the line separating North and
South.
   The first phase of the South Korean ``peace dam'' is scheduled
to be finished next month. The Olympic Games open in Seoul on Sept.
17.
   The rockfill dam sits in a valley close to the Demilitarized
Zone separating the two Koreas. It will cut off the flow of the Han
River, which originates in North Korea and runs past Seoul before
flowing into the Yellow Sea.
   Construction began in late 1986, shortly after North Korea began
building a hydroelectric dam on an upper stream of the river.
   Despite North Korea's repeated claim that its dam was designed
only to generate power, Seoul officials suspect that it also is
intended to unleash a ``water offensive'' against South Korea.
   If the North Korean dam collapsed, about 26 billion tons of
water could submerge most of Seoul and surrounding areas with a
``nuclear force,'' South Korean officials say.
   ``We have done something which was considered difficult to be
done in time,'' Chung In-ho of the government's Industrial Site and
Water Resources Development Corp. told reporters visiting the dam
site near Hwachun, a border town 55 miles northeast of the capital.
   South Korea is building the dam on a phased program designed to
match the progress of the North Korean dam under construction about
22 over the DMZ.
   South Korea hurried the first phase of the project in fear that
North Korea would try to flood some major sports facilities in
Seoul along the Han River before the Olympics.
   ``If North Korea attempts to flood us, the damage would be far
beyond our imagination,'' Lee Hee-sung, chief designer of the
state-run Industrial Site, said.
   Lee said South Korea poured $250 million into the first phase of
construction. The dam would eventually cost more than $600 million
U.S. dollars, he said.
   The dam will be at least 215 feet high, but it could be made
higher to match the North Korean dam, he said.
   He said satellite and other military intelligence reports show
that North Korea is also accelerating work on its dam, digging
diversion tunnels that made the river bed dry so that ground work
for the dam could start.
   The South Korean engineer said he believes that the Soviet Union
is helping North Korea with the construction.
   Lee questioned the economic feasibility of the North Korean
project, saying that when it is finished in four or five years, the
dam could probably utilize only 10 percent of water it takes in.

<HEAD>Freedom Asked For Woman Who Refuses To Disclose Daughter's
Whereabouts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for plastic surgeon Elizabeth Morgan
asked a federal judge Friday to free her from jail, where she has
spent seven months for refusing to allow visits between her
daughter and the girl's father.
   Attorney Stephen Sachs said the incarceration, the latest event
in a bitter custody battle, has become irrational and
unconstitutional because ``Dr. Morgan will never relent.''
   The plastic surgeon has been at D.C. Jail since last Aug. 28,
when she refused a D.C. Superior Court judge's order to allow her
5-year-old daughter to visit her ex-husband, who she charged had
abused the child.
   She has refused to disclose her daughter's whereabouts since
then.
   Sachs said that since Judge Herbert Dixon ordered the woman
jailed to coerce her to reveal the girl's whereabouts, ``Dr.
Morgan's incarceration has become punitive.''
   ``She will never comply with the order of the Superior Court,''
Sachs told U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson. ``It is not
likely any woman, any parent, could relent when she has seen what
has happened to her daughter.''
   The woman has charged through a long-running battle over the
girl's custody that Eric Foretich, also a prominent doctor in the
Washington area, abused the child. Foretich has denied the charges.
   Johnson said the issue of whether the length of incarceration
was unconstitutional had not been dealt with by the lower court or
by the local appeals court and so a federal court may not be the
proper forum for the case.
   The judge said she expected to rule next week on whether to
release the woman.

<HEAD>Congressman Says Operation Alliance Not Stopping War On Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turf wars, mismanagement and lack of
leadership plague a government task force created to stop the flow
of drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border, a congressman who
investigated the operation said Friday.
   ``Once again, a lack of leadership is undermining the war on
drugs,'' said Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., chairman of the House
Government Operations justice subcommittee, which spent a year
scrutinizing Operation Alliance and issued a critical report this
week. ``No one is in charge, no one is responsible.''
   Operation Alliance, set up in August 1986 to coordinate
drug-fighting efforts in the Southwest by a variety of federal
agencies, is headed by Frank Keating, assistant Treasury secretary
for enforcement.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese's chose Keating this week to fill
the No. 3 spot in the Justice Department, that of associate
attorney general.
   The Treasury Department said it had no comment Friday on the
report and a spokesman for the Justice Department, which has
several agencies involved in the alliance, referred questions to
Treasury.
   English, D-Okla., said he doesn't fault Keating for Operation
Alliance's failure to quell drug smuggling but blames the
administration for not giving someone the authority to marshal
staff and resources from the various agencies.
   ``Operation Alliance is a good idea that isn't working because
of turf battles and a lack of strong leadership from the top. The
agencies, including the Customs Service, Drug Enforcement
Administration and the Border Patrol, have been mired in the same
interagency feuding which has frustrated nearly all of our federal
anti-drug abuse programs,'' English said.
   ``In good conscience, I can't say Operation Alliance has made
much of a contribution,'' English said from Oklahoma.
   English blamed part of the problem on Mexico's ``refusal to
participate'' and also on Customs for not lending its air wing in
the fight on drugs along the 2,000-mile border.
   ``Operation Alliance is limited to ground action, but 60 percent
of cocaine comes in by air,'' English said.
   The report said that although administration officials had
promised to put an additional 300 Border Patrol agents along the
U.S.-Mexican border, where one-third of marijuana, cocaine and
heroin are believed to be smuggled into the country, there has been
a net loss of agents.
   Participating agencies failed to coordinate efforts and did not
use the El Paso Intelligence Center, or EPIC, where U.S. narcotics
information is stored and disseminated, the report said.
   The subcommittee compared the number and size of seizures in the
year before Operation Alliance with the first year after it went to
work, and found the size of the seizures had increased dramatically.
   But it said it was concerned the number of seizures has ``not
increased as dramatically as the administration has implied.''
   According to the report, EPIC figures indicate there were 246
cocaine seizures along the Southwest border totaling 2,256
kilograms between July 1985 and June 1986. But during the following
year, there were 120 cocaine seizures totaling 7,685 kilograms.

<HEAD>Accord Removes a Thorn, But Won't Speed Up a Treaty, Baker Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet decision to withdraw from
Afghanistan will remove one contentious issue from next month's
Moscow summit agenda but probably won't speed negotiations on a
superpower arms accord, the White House chief of staff said Friday.
   ``I think it will have a salutary effect on attitudes, but I do
not think it is likely to have a major impact on the other issues
on the agenda,'' Howard Baker told reporters covering President
Reagan, who was vacationing in California.
   Meanwhile, the State Department awaited notification that the
Kremlin had accepted an American proposal under which each side
would continue aiding its allies in the Afghan war as the estimated
120,000 Red Army troops leave Afghanistan.
   The Kremlin had rejected an earlier U.S. proposal that both
sides stop arming the warring parties during the nine months over
which the Soviets agreed to withdraw their troops, plus three
months thereafter, said State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   The United Nations mediator, Diego Garcia, told reporters in
Geneva that an agreement could be signed by the end of the week,
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the Red Army could
start leaving May 15.
   ``We have discussed, we have negotiated. That's over,'' mediator
Cordovez said. ``I want to inform you that the documents are now
finalized and open for signature.''
   Even though the Afghanistan accord is likely to improve the
atmosphere, at the May 29-June 2 summit, Reagan and other
administration officials say they do not expect to reach agreement
before the summit on the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
The treaty would cut U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear arsenals by
30 to 50 percent.
   Soviet officials say publicly that a START treaty could be
signed at the summit, but privately acknowledge it is unlikely they
can reach agreement.
   Baker denied published reports, attributed to anonymous United
Nations officials, that the superpowers had agreed to stop aiding
the warring Afghan parties. And he stressed that the administration
was withholding formal endorsement of the U.N. agreement until
reading the final terms.
   ``We have made it known that we will continue to aid the
mujahadeen if the Soviets continue their aid to the Kabul
government,'' he said. ``The mujahadeen are not being abandoned.
They're not being put at a disadvantage. They will be supplied as
long as there is a need for that and as the Soviets continue to
supply the Kabul government.''
   ``After we've had a chance to examine the text of the agreement
and heard formally from the Soviet Union, we will decide if all of
the conditions have been met for us to continue and to participate
as a guarantor of this agreement,'' Baker said.
   Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union nor the Afghan
guerrillas are direct parties to the U.N. talks, which involve the
government of Pakistan and the Kremlin-backed regime in Kabul.
   U.S. officials say agreement on aiding the Afghan parties hinges
on a clause in the U.N. accord guaranteeing that foreign powers
will not intervene or interfere in Afghan affairs.
   Pakistan, which has been channeling an estimated $600 million a
year in covert U.S. aid to the guerrillas, has agreed to continue
that program as long as Moscow aids Kabul, said administration
officials who spoke on condition they not be further identified.

<HEAD>Police Say Hostage Situation Was a Charade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who was killed by police after pretending
to hold a teen-age girl hostage for three hours had a history of
erratic behavior and family problems, said a woman who had been one
of his many foster mothers.
   Israel Ramos, 19, died Wednesday at York Hospital from a single
gunshot wound to the stomach to end a three-hour standoff in which
he held police at bay from his apartment with what turned out to be
plastic water pistols.
   Police originally thought Ramos had taken a 15-year-old girl
hostage, but after the shooting she told authorities the drama was
a charade and she was a willing participant.
   Debbie Ocasio, who took in Ramos when he was 15 and had a
history of family problems, said: ``I knew he was erratic, so I
wanted to help him. I knew that if I could just talk with him, that
would help.''
   Ramos was born in Puerto Rico and spent most of his life on the
streets in New York City, said Mrs. Ocasio. He came to Pennsylvania
with his mother about four years ago.
   Ramos' mother suffered from mental disorders and frequently
spent long periods in state hospitals, forcing her son to live with
foster families, Mrs. Ocasio said. His father remained in Puerto
Rico.
   While living with the Ocasios, Ramos attended high school,
maintained a B average and saw a counselor, she said. But his life
always took a turn for the worse whenever he saw his mother.
   ``Something about her just set him off,'' Mrs. Ocasio said.
   Hoping to stabilize him, Mrs. Ocasio said she arranged for Ramos
to live with a foster family in Philadelphia. He stayed there for
some time before moving back to York to live with his mother, but
she was admitted to Harrisburg State Mental Hospital about a year
later, and Ramos ``went downhill from there,'' Mrs. Ocasio said.
   District Attorney H. Stanley Rebert said Friday the
investigation of the incident is continuing. He would not identify
the girl involved nor say if she was being held for questioning.
   Police originally said the marksman, whom they have refused to
identify, fired when Ramos threatened to kill the girl. But
videotape recorded by WGAL-TV in Lancaster showed Ramos was shot
seconds after yelling, ``I'm coming out,'' and placing both hands
on a window frame. No gun was in sight.
   Carl Robertson, director of the York Spanish-American Center;
the mayor; and Police Chief William Hose did not return phone calls
for comment Friday afternoon.
   The officer who fired the fatal shot has been placed on
administrative leave without pay, pending an investigation that
could last four weeks, Rebert said.
   The district attorney said Ramos had a ``long-standing history
of mental health problems involving bizarre and unpredictable
behavior.''
   Police records indicate Ramos sometimes went into public
buildings impersonating health and police officials. He once went
into City Hall carrying a briefcase and asked to see Mayor William
Althaus. Police said Ramos was apprehended after threatening the
mayor and a pellet gun was confiscated.
   John Gentzler, Ramos' boss at York Snacks, said he worried about
Ramos, but not that he might hurt someone.
   ``He tells me he had no friends,'' Gentzler said. ``I knew he
needed some help, so I reached out to him as a father figure.''
   Gentzler said Ramos, who worked the overnight shift, got along
well with employees. He did have ``a little verbal battle with a
few workers'' early Wednesday, but Gentzler said he didn't think it
was anything to worry about.

   A man who was almost hit by a
Continental Airlines jet when he sneaked onto a busy airport runway
told deputies he wanted to hijack a plane home to Jamaica,
authorities said.
   Keble Arnold, 28, was charged with criminal trespass and jailed
without bail.
   Arnold was wearing five pairs of pants, possibly to protect
himself from the cold if he decided to stow away aboard an airplane
at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, sheriff's
spokesman Al Gordon said.
   ``He said he wanted to hijack a plane, but from the pants he was
wearing it looks like he was ready to stow away if he had to,''
Gordon said.
   Deputies said the jet, Flight 1734 from Denver, was traveling
140 mph when it almost hit Arnold while landing Wednesday night.
   Ron Gardner of the Broward County aviation department said
stowing away in an airliner's wheel wells was risky.
   ``It's cold up there and there's no air,'' he said. ``There have
been stowaways who have frozen to death, and then dropped out of
the plane when the landing gear came down.''

   Iraq fired four long-range missiles into
Tehran and other Iranian cities Friday before Iranians began voting
in parliamentary elections. Iran said it fired rockets into Baghdad
and other cities in retaliation.
   Each side said the other's missiles hit residential areas,
killing civilians.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, also
reported that Iraqi warplanes hit a ``large maritime target,''
which usually means a tanker, off Iran's Persian Gulf coast before
dawn.
   There was no immediate independent confirmation.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Cyprus, said Iranian artillery shelled the strategic Dukan
hyrdoelectric dam in northeast Iraq, where Revolutionary Guards
have captured a large chunk of mountainous Kurdistan in the last
three weeks.
   It was not known whether the dam, 60 miles north of Iraq's
Kirkuk oil fields, was damaged.
   The Iranians occupy heights overlooking another important dam
and power station on Lake Darbandikhan, south of Dukan. Crippling
or capturing the two facilities could leave the strategic region
around Kirkuk without power.
   Both Iran and Iraq have fired nearly 300 long-range missiles
into each other's population centers in the latest chapter of the
so-called ``war of the cities.'' Hundreds of civilians have been
killed on both sides since the battle broke out Feb. 29.
   The Iran news agency said that Iraqi missiles were fired Friday
into residential neighborhoods in Tehran, the holy city of Qom, the
central city of Isfahan and Tabriz in the northwest.
   It said Iraqi warplanes raided several Iranian cities, but gave
no details.
   The Iraqi missiles smashed into Iran hours before polling
stations opened, killing or wounding civilians, the agency said. It
gave no figures.
   However, the attacks appeared to fall far short of the missile
blitz Iranian leaders had been expecting during the elections for
the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament.
   The agency said the Iranians retaliated by firing two missiles
into Baghdad, two into the northern city of Mosul, two in the
border town of Khanaqin and one into al-Amarah, an Iraqi military
area in the south, causing ``considerable damage and casualties.''
   The Iraqi News Agency confirmed one of the strikes on Baghdad
and said civilians were killed, without citing a number. It
reported other fatalities from long-range Iranian artillery fire on
Iraqi border cities.
   Iran said its warplanes bombed military targets in northern
Iraq, but the Iraqi News Agency said the jets hit residential
neighborhoods in the northern city of Amadiya and in border towns,
killing civilians.

<HEAD>Independent Counsel Answers Motions of Iran-Contra Defendants</HEAD>

   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh denied
Friday that the he illegally relied on the congressional testimony
of defendants in the Iran-Contra case who received limited immunity
from Congress.
   A brief filed by Walsh's office said the ``overwhelming
majority'' of his case against former national security adviser
John M. Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and businessman Albert
Hakim is based on evidence collected before the three defendants
gave congressional testimony last year.
   ``Defendants involvement in the activities underlying the
indictment had been fully identified prior to any of their
immunized testimony,'' said the prosecution brief filed in U.S.
District Court.
   ``The government, in short, had no need for any imunized
testimony to focus or aid its investigation,'' said the pleading
filed by Herbert J. Stern, a former federal judge who was hired to
represent the independent counsel on the immunity issue.
   The prosecution opposed the motion by the three defendants to
dismiss the indictment on the the ground that the criminal charges
violated their Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination.
   The three, along with retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord, are accused of conspiring to illegally divert profits from
the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Secord, the lead witness at last year's congressional hearings,
gave his testimony on Capitol Hill without limited immunity.
   Under the so-called ``use immunity'' granted by Congress, Walsh
is prohibited from using the congressional testimony of North,
Poindexter and Hakim as evidence against them.
   But Stern argued that the immunity restriction does not apply to
statements any of the defendants made voluntarily to the House and
Senate Iran-Contra committees. Such statements are distinguished
from compelled testimony given in response to questions, Stern said.
   But the prosecution offered to forgo introduction of such
statements by the three defendants as evidence if U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell agrees not to hold an extensive pre-trial
hearing on the immunity issue.
   Stern called the defense request for a ``massive, multi-month''
hearing an attempt ``to use pre-trial proceedings to delay their
trial by jury and obtain unparalleled discovery in a criminal
case.''
   The prosecution proposed to submit for Gesell's review
``sufficient evidence _ documents and witness interviews all
collected or requested before the immunized testimony _ to
demonstate that it is not unfair to place the defendants on trial.''
   Before Walsh began his investigation early last year, he
received information from the presidential commission that
investigated the U.S.-Iran arms sales, the House and Senate
intelligence committees and the Justice Department, which had
conducted a preliminary inquiry that led to his appointment as
independent counsel, Stern said.
   Attached as an exhibit was a December, 1986 memo to Swiss
authorities by then-Assistant Attorney General William Weld seeking
Switzerland's cooperation in obtaining records of the arms deals
from bank accounts kept by Hakim and Secord.
   The memo states that the Justice Department had already
determined that an undetermined amount of the proceeds from the
arms sales were not accounted for.
   Weld also identifed conspiracy to defraud the government and
wire fraud as possible offenses committed by Hakim, North and
Secord. The indictment accuses all four defendants with committing
those offenses.
   Gesell is scheduled to hold a hearing next Tuesday on the
immunity issue. He indicated in a brief opinion earlier this week
that he was prepared to discuss a ``realistic trial date.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven regional centers have been awarded $5.2
million to train health professionals in AIDS prevention and
treatment, federal officials announced Friday.
   Dr. Robert E. Windom, assistant Health and Human Services
secretary for health, said the new centers will join four
established last year in providing service to 47 states, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
   He said other centers will be added later this year.
   The centers are expected to collaborate with medical and nursing
schools, hospitals, health departments and other organizations to
train primary care providers for local communities and to train
selected health professionals to serve as instructors in their
communities.
   Each center also is expected to provide hotline, clearinghouse
and referral services to health professionals within its region.
   Grants supporting the first year of the three-year projects were
awarded to:
   _University of Southern California, Los Angeles, $791,883, to
serve five counties in Southern California.
   _University of Colorado, Denver, $900,000, to serve Colorado,
Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and
Wyoming.
   _Emory University, Atlanta, $949,760, to serve Alabama, Florida,
Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
   _University of Illinois, Chicago, $808,835, which will serve
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin.
   _Louisiana State University, New Orleans, $549,661, to serve
Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi.
   _University of Maryland, Baltimore, $480,000, to serve Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
   _University of Massachusetts, Worcester, $717,625, which will
serve Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.
   The first four training centers were established last September
with HHS grants to New York University, Ohio State University, the
University of Washington and the University of California-Davis.

<HEAD>Brush Fire Threat Continues Across Florida; Thousands of Acres
Destroyed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters worked Friday to contain brush fires
across the state that were fueled by dry wind and burned thousands
of acres of grassland, trees, bushes and shrubs.
   Two firefighters suffered minor injuries fighting the blaze
Thursday. No damage to buildings was reported.
   The largest fire destroyed 1,500 to 2,000 acres at the edge of
the Osceola National Forest, said Larry Amison, spokesman for the
state Division of Forestry.
   He said firefighters were trying to hold fire lines, Amison
said. ``But there's a large unburned area inside the line, and
they're not confident they'll be able to hold it if the winds pick
up.''
   A fire that authorities tried to contain near Port St. Lucie was
the biggest concern, said Seb Farina, Division of Forestry
spokesman. The fire had burned nearly 1,300 acres and endangered a
residential subdivision.
   ``It's out of the (fire) lines,'' Farina said. ``There are some
structures that could be threatened. It's not a hysterical sort of
thing, but it's the fire with the greatest potential.''
   Because Florida remained dry Friday, with wind gusting up to 20
mph, officials expected the fire problem to continue.

   A man whose shooting of a pregnant woman
resulted in the death of her baby was sentenced Friday to 15 to 30
years in prison.
   Leonard Hall, 21, of New York, claimed he accidentally shot
Brigitte Garrett, 29, while firing into a crowd at a bully who had
beaten him up.
   Ms. Garrett, who underwent seven hours of surgery and was
hospitalized 11 days after she was shot, wept quietly in her
second-row seat as state Supreme Court Justice William Davis
pronounced sentence. ``I thank the Lord and I thank (Assistant
District Attorney) Joel Seidemann,'' she said.
   Hall was convicted March 9 of second-degree manslaughter,
second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and first-degree
assault. The jury cleared him of murder, after finding he had not
intended to harm Ms. Garrett.
   Ms. Garrett, who now lives in Los Angeles, gave birth to a
2-pound-5-ounce baby, who had a heartbeat but no other vital
functions. Named Atallah, she died of respiratory failure 36 hours
later.
   Hospital officials said the baby had hyaline membrane disease,
common to premature babies, and never breathed without life support
equipent.
   The homicide case centered on whether the baby was born alive
since she never breathed independently. Citing a 1949 New York
decision known as the ``born alive'' ruling, defense lawyers argued
unsuccessfully that since the baby never survived without
mechanical life support, she could not be considered a person and
Hall could not be charged with her death.
   The ``born alive'' ruling defines a ``person'' as one who has
been fully expelled from the mother's body and had independent
circulation.

   Stephen Stillman may have won $2 million
in the New York Lottery, but the thrill of victory didn't stop him
from feeling the agony of ... a dog bite?
   He showed off the poodle-inflicted bite at a news conference
Friday.
   When the winning numbers were broadcast April 6, Stillman, 34,
flew up the stairs, hugged his wife and, in the uproar, got bitten
by his dog, he said.
   Stillman and his wife, Cathy, of suburban Greece, have played
the same six numbers for four years. Those numbers _ 17, 24, 27,
31, 39 and 43 _ represent the jersey numbers of their favorite
sports figures, including baseball Hall of Famer Willie Mays and
Dave Winfield of the New York Yankees.
   The couple will receive an after-tax check of $76,190 annually
for 21 years, with the first pay-off coming in about two weeks.
They said they plan to take a vacation, pay some bills and send
their 16-year-old son to college.
   Stillman is a restaurant manager. His wife works at the
restaurant and attends the University of Buffalo. They said they do
not plan to quit their jobs.

<HEAD>Justice Department Challenges Independent Counsel Law in High
Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a conflict of interest, responsibility
for investigating and prosecuting alleged offenses by high
administration officials must remain with the president, the
Justice Department said Friday.
   Solicitor General Charles Fried presented that argument in a
Supreme Court brief which challenges the constitutionality of the
law under which independent counsels are appointed by a federal
court to investigate wrongdoing by top executive branch officers.
   The system of court-appointed independent counsels grew out of
the Watergate scandal and the counsels are insulated from removal
except for misconduct or incapacity.
   ``The possibility of personal and political conflicts of
interest does not justify this sort of patchwork improvement on the
Constitution,'' Fried said.
   His brief details objections first made last year by Justice
Department officials to the independent counsel provisions of the
1978 Ethics in Government Act.
   ``The Constitution does not contemplate that the president may
be `disqualified' because of an impermissible `conflict' between
his chief political interest and his responsibility as chief
executive,'' Fried said.
   ``Any such `conflict' is intrinsic to the vesting of all
executive power in an elected president,'' the 50-page brief added.
   It concluded that the tools supplied by the Constitution to deal
with the conflict problem _ criminal prosecution by regular or
special prosecutors within the executive branch, congressional
investigation and impeachment _ ``have been used with success
throughout our history.''
   The solicitor general's brief says that the independent counsel
statute unconstitutionally takes executive power from the president
and violates the appointments clause of the Constitution.
   The limitations on removing independent counsels are
inconsistent with Supreme Court decisions and there is no precedent
for vesting purely executive power in court-appointed officers,
Fried concluded.
   The solicitor general's brief was filed in a case involving
independent counsel Alexia Morrison, whose constitutional authority
is being challenged by the target of her criminal investigation,
former Justice Department official Theodore Olson.
   Olson won a favorable ruling at the federal appeals court level.
Morrison is appealing. The government's brief was filed in support
of Olson.
   Now a Washington lawyer, Olson is under investigation for
allegedly lying to Congress in the 1983 Environmental Protection
Agency controversy in which the executive branch of government
initially withheld documents from congressional investigating
committees.
   If the Supreme Court rules against independent counsels, it
would be unlikely to affect criminal investigations of the
Iran-Contra scandal and of Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
Independent counsels in both those probes have accepted parallel
appointments within the Justice Department as a safeguard against
constitutional challenges to their authority.

   About 300 Kurds, some wearing gas masks,
demonstrated Friday at the Iraqi Embassy to denounce President
Saddam Hussein for his use of chemical warfare against civilians.
   Chanting ``Saddam Butcher of the Kurds,'' the demonstrators also
held up photographs of scarred bodies they said were victims of a
March 16 chemical attack on the northern Iraqi town of Halabja.
   About 5,000 Iraqi Kurds were reported killed in the Iraqi
bombing raid on the town, which had been captured by Iran. Several
dozen wounded were flown by Iran to Europe and the United States
for treatment of mustard gas exposure.
   The Kurdistan Democratic Party, which organized the rally, said
survivors have testified that thousands of people are still buried
under the ruins in Halabja and that the town has turned into an
open grave for more than 4,000 dead. Seven thousand were wounded,
the party said.
   The protesters called on the United Nations and international
humanitarian organizations to send emergency relief and medical
supplies to the town, and to condemn Hussein.

   A battered 3-year-old being used as a
panhandling prop died just after a concerned passerby sent her to a
hospital, the second death in two weeks of a toddler who lived at
the city's largest welfare hotel, police said Friday.
   The girl's mother's boyfriend was charged with murder.
   Maya Figueroa had ``bruises and contusions on her face, back and
neck. Some of these bruises appeared to be recent,'' police Capt.
Michael Gardner said at a news conference.
   Police questioned the girl's mother, Elise Vasquez, 32, who was
in Bellevue Hospital after giving birth Wednesday to her fifth
child.
   The girl was pronounced dead Thursday evening, 20 minutes after
she arrived at New York University Medical Center, said Aaron
Rosenthal, assistant chief of Manhattan detectives.
   An autopsy Friday indicated the toddler died of blunt force
injuries of head and abdomen with internal injuries and bleeding,
said Ellen Borakove of the city medical examiner's office. The case
was officially ruled child abuse and a homicide, she said.
   The girl had been sent to the hospital by a man who saw her on a
street corner with Benito Sanches, 29, who had been panhandling,
police said. Maya was in a stroller and her 18-month-old brother
was in Sanches' arms, Rosenthal said.
   ``Maya appeared to be in serious condition with trauma at least
around the face,'' Rosenthal said.
   He said Sanches had a habit of using the children to panhandle.
   ``He'll take two of the children of his girlfriend, put them in
a stroller and go out and solicit funds in their presence,''
Rosenthal said.
   The passerby, who had not been identified, stopped a cab, gave
the driver $5 and told him to take Sanches and the children to a
hospital. The cab driver told police what had happened.
   Gardner said police were seeking the passerby.
   ``We appeal to him to come forward. We would like to speak to
him about what was going on,'' said Gardner.
   Sanches is a drug abuser with a past record who came to the
United States in May 1980 with the Cuban boat lift, Gardner said.
He was charged with second-degree murder, said police Officer Jim
Coleman.
   Maya lived with her mother, her brother and Sanches at the
Prince George Hotel on Manhattan's East Side, where the city houses
463 homeless families, or about 2,600 people.
   The city provides housing for about 28,000 homeless people,
12,000 of them in welfare hotels and the remainder in shelters,
said spokeswoman Suzanne Trazoff of the Human Resources
Administration.
   Two weeks ago, 3-year-old Quintin McKenzie was scalded to death
in a bathtub at the hotel. His mother, Merian McKenzie, was charged
with second-degree murder and her husband, Calvin C. McKenzie, was
charged with assault for allegedly beating the toddler.
   ``These are terrible stories,'' said Ms. Trazoff.
   ``The Prince George has a large number of social services,'' she
said. A social service office, open during daytime hours, is
located in the hotel and a variety of programs are available,
including preschool and day care programs, she said.
   When asked why no one apparently noticed that the child had been
beaten, Ms. Trazoff speculated that the child's family may not have
requested any social services.
   The spokeswoman said HRA was checking its records to see if the
family had ever asked for help from the agency.
   The 18-month-old boy, whose name was not released, was admitted
to the hospital for observation although he had no visible signs of
abuse.
   Sanches and Ms. Vasquez had lived together for 16 months,
Rosenthal said. Ms. Vasquez's two other children live with
relatives. The baby she had just had at Bellevue was the first the
couple had together.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. donned an olive-green field
jacket for his opening salvo in the New York presidential primary's
battle of the airwaves.
   ``I'm a Vietnam veteran _ one of the lucky ones,'' Gore says in
a new ad for television. Because of his experience, he says, he has
worked ``for arms control, for peace, for a strong bargaining
position with the Russians.''
   Gore's experience is the focus of two new ads that began airing
in New York this week. A third, unveiled Friday, touts a commitment
to education and suggests using the military against drug smugglers.
   On the stump Friday, Gore underscored the drug theme by telling
a Long Island audience, ``This administration declared a war
against drugs and drugs won. They've got to say yes to funding for
drug programs.''
   Gore's new ads, with one mild exception, do not take direct aim
at his opponents as did earlier commercials. ``We just do issues,''
said a senior adviser, Bill Haddad. ``That's what we've been doing.
That's going to continue.''
   Gore, who has not won a contest since Super Tuesday, hopes to
revive his struggling candidacy in New York, and television ads are
a key segment of his strategy. Those out this week are the first of
six that are planned.
   But the effort may be hamstrung by the sky-high price of
advertising in New York. Gore media manager David Garth has
indicated discontent with the size of the campaign's TV buy.
   Garth said ideally he would want to spend $2 million on TV time,
but would settle for $1 million. Gore aides said they had committed
$500,000 and hoped for more. The Gore campaign is $1.5 million in
debt.
   The first two Gore ads are biographical spots aimed at
introducing him to voters. The field jacket ad shows him standing
in front of Manhattan's Vietnam War memorial as he recounts his
experience and his efforts for peace; in his only reference to his
opponents, he says, ``I believe no other Democrat running for
president has the experience to make that fight.''
   The second advertisement presents a sequence of still photos and
footage _ Gore at Harvard, in the Army, in the Senate, and talking
to voters. An announcer says: ``Vote for Al Gore. He's got a solid
record. He can win.''
   In the third, Gore, his tie loosened, declares: ``We're losing
too many kids to drugs and an inadequate education.'' Education is
important to the nation's security, he says, ``and if that means
using the military to help stop drugs at our borders, then let's do
it.''
   Gore has been more aggressive in campaign appearances, directly
criticizing his opponents, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts
and Jesse Jackson.
   Dukakis has been on the air this week with biographical ads.
Jackson, who has bought very little ad time over the course of the
campaign, was filmed campaigning in Brooklyn on Tuesday for
possible advertising footage, but aides said his ad strategy for
the primary was uncertain.
   ``It's not until April 19,'' said Jackson ad man Dan Mowbray.
``And in the Jackson campaign that's a world away.''

<TEXT>
   A special grand jury that charged 15
Mingo County politicians with buying slots on election ballots
struck a blow against the corrupt practices that dominated
elections in southern West Virginia for years, a prosecutor says.
   The practice of ``slating'' candidates and encouraging citizens
to vote straight tickets has contributed to the conditions alleged
in an indictment that was handed up Thursday, said special
prosecutor James Colburn.
   ``I don't see how after this anyone could run as part of a
slate,'' Colburn said.
   Those indicted included a state senator, the county prosecutor,
the mayor of Williamson, two county commissioners, two county
school board members, three former delegates to the state assembly,
one magistrate and one former magistrate, a former court clerk, a
former county clerk and a former school board member who was also
director of the county anti-poverty agency.
   The state grand jury charged the 15 with paying to be listed on
Democratic slates controlled by former Sheriff Johnie Owens and
with using bribes and illegal campaign contributions to ``subvert
the free election system.'' The indictment focused primarily on the
1984 election.
   A 16th defendant, state Sen. Truman Chafin, was indicted on a
felony bribery charge. He is accused of accepting a bribe when he
was a county commissioner to help current Mingo County Sheriff
Charles ``Eddie'' Hilbert ``buy'' the office from Owens for
$100,000.
   ``I've tried all my life to live a decent life, and something
like this is quite a shock,'' said one indicted man, Robert
Simpkins, a member of the county school board.
   ``I can't remember if I gave them any money, but it couldn't
have been any more than $500,'' said another of the accused, former
County Clerk Hugh Wellman. ``I didn't think there was anything
illegal about it. You go through life, and you forget these things.
That's been four years ago,''
   Colburn said the indictment should be a warning to other
politicians who might use slates to further their positions. The
grand jurors, however, blamed residents of Mingo County for the
dominance of slate politics.
   ``This Grand Jury would urge that every citizen of Mingo County
not sell or give up their franchise or right to vote, but to
exercise it without fear or purchase,'' the jury's report said.
   Former magistrate Bill Webb said the indictments ``were
blatantly political and were returned without any evidence
whatsoever.'' He said he will continue his re-election campaign.
   Also indicted Thursday was Goodwill Motors Inc., a used car
dealership at Delbarton owned by former county commissioner and
former county Democratic Chairman Stewart Justice. Justice was not
named as a defendant.
   Arraignment for all defendants is scheduled Wednesday in Mingo
County CircuitCourt.
   Owens and Hilbert were not named in Thursday's indictments.
   Owens pleaded guilty earlier this year in federal court to one
count of bribery and three counts of tax evasion and is scheduled
to be sentenced on those charges April 18. He faces sentencing on a
state income tax evasion count April 19.
   Hilbert has been indicted by a federal grand jury on 13 felony
counts of buying his office, helping protect a drug ring in return
for illegal campaign contributions and buying and selling marijuana
out of his office. He is scheduled to enter a plea to those charges
on April 18.
   Colburn said the state grand jury will meet at least once more,
on May 10, the date of the West Virginia primary, to hear evidence
of any violations in that election.

<HEAD>Knights of Malta Convene Secret Conclave To Select New Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Knights of Malta convened a secret conclave in a
hilltop villa Friday to elect a new leader of the 900-year-old
Roman Catholic charitable order.
   Thirty-six electors clad in black robes locked themselves in a
third-floor room of a palazzo on the Aventine Hill to cast ballots
for a new grand master. Two of the candidates are Americans.
   The previous grand master, Angelo de Mojana di Cologna, died
Jan. 18 at the age of 82 after 25 years as the knights' leader.
   The result of the election is not expected to be announced until
early next week after ratification by Pope John Paul II.
   A grand master, who is elected for life, carries the title of
prince and ``most eminent highness.'' Equal in rank to a cardinal,
he is considered the highest ranking layman in the Roman Catholic
church.
   The order's 78th grand master will be chosen from among 22 of
the electors who have attained the rank of ``Professed Knights of
Justice.''
   To be eligible, the new leader must have followed vows of
poverty, obedience and chastity and be able to prove 200 years of
nobility on the side of both parents.
   The group _ formally known as the Sovereign Military Order of
the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta _ was
founded during the crusades when it opened a hospice for pilgrims
in Jerusalem in the early 11th century.
   It has the status of an independent state and has diplomatic
relations with 50 nations.
   The order has about 10,000 members, led by Italy with 2,800.
About 2,500 members live in the United States.
   The knights operate about 200 hospitals and first aid centers in
90 nations, mostly in poor areas and war zones.
   The 36 electors, all members of the Council Complete of State,
assembled for a morning Mass in the villa's 18th century Santa
Maria del Priorato church.
   In his homily, the prelate of the order, Archbishop Mario Brini,
said the new grand master should be ``a man of great faith, imbued
with charisma of the order which Pope John Paul II has not
hesitated to count among the treasures of the church, a heritage
which must be defended and strengthened to make it always more
adaptable to the changing needs of the times.''
   Following the service, the group walked in a slow procession
around the church courtyard and through a passageway flanked by
orange trees. The 22 Knights of Justice wore the order's
eight-pointed white cross on their sleeves, while the others wore
the emblem over their chests.
   The officials then entered the villa and went to the Hall of the
Council Complete of State, where they sat at a long table covered
by a red cloth. The room, which is reserved for elections of grand
masters, is lined with portraits of previous leaders and has a
splendid view of the capital.
   The 22 candidates include de Mojana's interim replacement,
Giancarlo Pallavicini, a Hungarian-born American biochemist, and
Cyrille Toumanoff, who was born in the Soviet Union and lives in
the United States. Their American hometowns were not immediately
available.
   The others are nine Italians, four Austrians, two Englishmen,
two Czechoslovaks, and one each from West Germany, Hungary and
Spain.
   The rest of the council is made up of presidents of the order's
associations around the world, including New York financier J.
Peter Grace.

<HEAD>East Coast Gets Rain; Rockies Get Snow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain soaked the East Coast from Virginia to southern New England
on Friday, while light snow fell in the northern Rockies and high
winds buffeted the Southwest.
   Showers were heaviest in Maryland and Virginia. Salisbury, Md.,
got 2.72 inches of rain in a 24-hour period ending at 8 a.m. EDT.
Langley Air Force Base and Norfolk Naval Air Station, both in
Virginia, got nearly an inch of rain apiece in six hours.
   In Montana, Billings got 3 inches of snow, West Yellowstone 2
inches and Butte and Bozeman 1 inch.
   Snow advisories were issued for the central third of Montana and
the north-central mountains of Wyoming due to high winds that were
blowing snow and causing hazardous driving conditions.
   Elsewhere, temperatures were chilly in the Northwest, where four
towns in western Oregon tied or set record lows for the date:
Klamath Falls' 17 degrees bettered the 22 degrees set in 1982;
Medford's 25 beat the 27 degrees set in 1919; Astoria's 30 bettered
the mark of 31 set in 1975, and Portland tied its 32-degree mark
set in 1952.
   Wind advisories were issued for southern Nevada and the northern
mountains and deserts of southern California. Winds of 35-40 mph
were recorded in Sandberg and Daggett, in California's northern
deserts. Northern and central California coastal waters also were
under a gale warning.
   Florida, the Gulf Coast and the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio
valleys all enjoyed sunshine and mild temperatures.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 26 degrees at Yellowstone
Park, Wyo., to 96 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif. The morning low
was 2 degrees in McCall, Idaho.
   Saturday's forecast called for widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms extending from Texas across Oklahoma to eastern
Kansas; rain from western Kansas across Nebraska and the Dakotas to
Minnesota, mixing with snow in western parts of South Dakota and
Nebraska; and rain and drizzle in eastern New England.
   High temperatures should be in the 60s to 70s for much of the
nation, dipping into the 40s to 50s from the Middle and Northern
Atlantic States to eastern Ohio, and from northern Michigan across
northern Minnesota and the Dakotas and western parts of the central
Plains to the north-central Rockies, into the 30s in the mountains
of Wyoming and Colorado, into the 80s in southern Florida, the
central Gulf Coast, from southern and eastern Texas to central
Missouri and most of California; and into the low 90s in the desert
Southwest.

<HEAD>State Department Issues Travel Advisory For Honduras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department warned Friday against
travel to Honduras by U.S. citizens because of anti-American riots
that erupted in that Central American nation.
   Honduran President Jose Azona Hoyo declared a state of emergency
in the country's two major cities, Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula,
after students smashed shop windows and overturned cars in the
violence, sparked by the forced deportation to the United States of
a Honduran suspected of drug trafficking.
   ``Until the situation is clarified, the Department of State
recommends that U.S. citizens defer travel to any area of Honduras.
Expiration for this travel advisory is indefinite,'' said Sondra
McCarty, a department spokeswoman.
   On Thursday, five people were killed in an attack on the U.S.
Embassy. About 2,000 university students attacked two U.S. Embassy
annex buildings and set both ablaze. At least 10 people were
wounded, none of them Americans.
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Friday
the Reagan administration was puzzled by amount of time it took
police to arrive on the scene Thursday evening.
   ``We do not understand the slow response. We are highly
concerned over the threat this posed to American and Honduran lives
and the destruction of American property,'' she said, and the
matter had been taken up with Honduran authorities.

<HEAD>Koch Says He Was Speaking To Jews, Not For Them, On Jackson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said Friday he was speaking
to Jews, not for them, when he said they would be ``crazy'' to vote
for presidential candidate Jesse Jackson.
   Koch stressed that when he recently criticized Jackson, he had
said Jews and ``supporters of Israel'' would be crazy to vote for
Jackson. The reason, he said, was that Jackson had expressed
positions that would weaken U.S. support for Israel militarily,
economically and morally.
   He also said Jackson would bankrupt America through a $300
billion spending program for ``pie in the sky'' social programs and
would disarm the United States.
   ``Supporters of Jesse Jackson are saying Koch can't say these
things. They they will cloud it by saying it's divisive,'' Koch
complained. ``What do you think a political campaign is? A
political campaign is divisive. Somebody's got to win and
somebody's got to lose.''
   He added, ``You gotta earn your right to be the president. That
person is the most important person in the whole world politically.
Shouldn't we know what he stands for?''

   Mayor Coleman Young, who two weeks ago backed the
presidential bid of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in Michigan,
surprised some Jesse Jackson supporters by reportedly offering to
donate $10,000 to $20,000 to Jackson's campaign.
   Young met Thursday with Joel Ferguson, an East Lansing developer
who headed Jackson's efforts in Michigan. Though the mayor wouldn't
specify how much he would give, Ferguson said Young offered between
$10,000 and $20,000 to Jackson's campaign.
   ``He called it a modest contribution. I called it substantial.
It's a statement that Jesse appreciates,'' Ferguson said.
   Young said he was willing to contribute because Jackson's
campaign has united black and white voters as well as raising
issues of economic and racial justice.
   Jackson crushed Dukakis in Michigan's Democratic caucuses on
March 26.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects LaRouche Attempt To Get On Ballot In Indiana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge rejected an attempt Friday
to put political extremist Lyndon LaRouche on the ballot for
Indiana's May 3 Democratic primary for president.
   U.S. District Judge S. Hugh Dillin ruled against a LaRouche
argument that the candidate's rights were violated by a requirement
that his campaign submit 500 signatures from each of the state's 10
congressional districts on his ballot petitions.
   Because LaRouche's campaign turned in fewer than the required
500 signatures for the 10th District, the Indiana secretary of
state's office refused to certify him for the ballot.
   Dillin also told lawyers from the state attorney general's
office that they could ask LaRouche to pay the state's costs
because his attorneys had failed to do proper research and had
brought what amounted to a frivolous action.

<HEAD>Slow Caucus Count Prompts Talk About Having A Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colorado's slow reporting of Democratic caucus
results has prompted talk about switching to a primary system for
presidential races.
   Democratic caucuses were held in Colorado Monday but the state
party was continuing to report results later in the week;
meanwhile, Wisconsin's presidential primary was Tuesday. ``Colorado
never even had its hour in the sun,'' said former Gov. Richard
Lamm, adding: ``By the time we got our results in, Wisconsin was
the news.''
   Lamm, a Democrat, had raised the matter of a primary with other
Western governors a few years ago when the 1988 Super Tuesday round
of primaries and caucuses, through much of the South, was taking
shape.
   ``I think our strength is in unity,'' Lamm said Wednesday in an
interview with the Rocky Mountain News. ``Colorado is never going
to be a major player by itself.''
   State Democratic Chairman Buie Seawell has said he favors the
concept but state Republican Chairman Bruce Benson is cool to it.
``I suppose I could be talked into it, but I'm not wild about it,''
said Benson.

<HEAD>Commerce Secretary Expects No Breakthroughs in Soviet Trade Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity said
Friday that he expected no breakthroughs in trade talks next week
with Soviet officials in Moscow.
   But Verity, who is leading a delegation of American officials
for the tenth session of the Joint Commercial Commission, said he
was hopeful the negotiations could lay the groundwork for expanded
trade.
   The joint commission was formed in 1973 to bring trade agencies
of the two governments together. The meetings will take place at
the same time a trade delegation of 400 American businessmen will
be in Moscow for talks on trade opportunities.
   Verity, who will be meeting with Soviet officials including
Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said the United States would
seek expanded opportunities for American companies to sell their
products in the Soviet Union.
   Last year, trade between the United States and the Soviet Union
totaled $1.5 billion, two-thirds of that in grain sales. This
represented just 0.5 percent of American export sales and was a
decline from $4.5 billion in U.S.-Soviet trade in 1979, before
President Carter imposed the trade embargo after Soviet troops
invaded Afghanistan.
   ``We are not going to Moscow for any breakthroughs,'' Verity
said. ``We do not expect any dramatic increase in trade to result.
What we hope to do is to create a new climate and a foundation for
future trade.''
   Verity said he would stress that expanded trade can only take
place if the Soviets make ``further improvements elsewhere in our
bilateral relationship, particularly on human rights and
immigration.''
   Asked whether the Thursday announcement that Soviet troops would
begin pulling out of Afghanistan on May 15 would help the trade
talks, Verity said he believed that President Reagan was ``very
happy'' with the development.
   ``There isn't any question in my mind that if the Soviets would
continue to indicate that they would like to lessen tensions, that
would certainly have an effect on the American people and the
American Congress,'' Verity said.
   Verity, who will leave for Moscow on Sunday, won Cabinet
approval earlier this week for a plan to set up high-level working
groups with the Soviets to spur exchanges in five areas: food
processing, energy, construction equipment, medical products and
the services sector, including insurance.
   Verity said it was hoped that these working groups will provide
channels to develop specific markets for U.S. products.
   The meetings next week are expected to produce some agreements
on the establishment of joint ventures between American companies
and the Soviet Union.
   The trade meetings will come six weeks before Reagan travels to
Moscow for his fourth summit conference with Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Purported Baby-Selling Agency Stirs Controversy in West Germany</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials are trying to shut
down an advertising agency that has found a legal loophole allowing
it sell babies to adoptive parents.
   ``For You Too: A Child from the Third World for 12,000 marks
($7,270),'' reads an advertising flier from the Frankfurt-based
Hamel and Keller agency. Strict laws bar private adoption agencies.
   ``We are completely legal,'' Uwe Hamel, 32, told The Associated
Press. ``All we are doing is breaking through the monopoly of
state-run offices that put couples wanting to adopt through the
torture of long waits and tests before they get a child.''
   To circumvent the adoption law, Hamel says, a prospective
adoptive father declares himself the father of an illegitimate
child and signs a contract with the baby's mother, who is paid to
verify his claim.
   The adoptive father then applies to a West German court for the
child to be declared his legitimate offspring, Hamel said.
   Hamel said he makes about $3,000 as the go-between, with the
rest of the fee going to the mother.
   ``There is nothing in our law that forbids this,'' he said.
   The agency sends its advertising fliers to prospective adoptive
parents and gynecologists.
   ``I can arrange immediately for a child. The prices: 30,000
marks ($18,000) for a child from the Middle East; 15,000 marks
($9,000) for a child from the Far East; 45,000 marks ($27,000) for
a German child,'' one flier said.
   Frankfurt city officials are working to shut down Hamel's office
``because it is morally and ethically wrong to profit by selling
human beings,'' city spokesman Stefan Lauer told the AP.
   Last year, Frankfurt won a court order to shut down United
Families International, an information office for the Infertility
Center of Michigan, Inc.
   The Michigan office is operated by American lawyer Noel P.
Keane, who gained fame in the ``Baby M'' surrogate motherhood case.
   ``We closed down the Keane office last year, and in this case we
also think it is morally and ethically wrong to make a profit by
trading in children,'' Lauer said.
   The case has been getting heavy publicity.
   The Frankfurter Rundschau published an article about Hamel's
operation under the headline, ``Businessman Deals in Babies from
the Third World.''
   The Frankfurt Abendpost newspaper wrote: ``Frankfurt Office
Takes Advantage of Law's Loopholes for Scandalous Baby Trade.''
   Different prices does not mean the agency considers one baby
more valuable than another because of race, Hamel said.
   ``In West Germany a mother is entitled to as much as 2,000 marks
($1,480) per month to support herself and a child.
   ``A Third World mother can often support herself and a baby for
about 200 marks ($120) per month, depending on which country she's
from,'' he added.
   Hamel said he has so far arranged the adoption of nine babies.
His office has been operating for two months.

   The Reagan administration has rejected a
Soviet proposal to conduct tests to determine whether cruise
missiles aboard ships are armed with nuclear or conventional
warheads, a U.S. official said Friday.
   Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev raised the issue at the
Washington summit last December, saying the Soviets had a new
scientific technique. And the Soviets want to include limits on
sea-launched cruise missiles in a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
now under negotiation.
   U.S. officials argue that it is impossible to verify whether
ship-board cruise missiles are armed with nuclear or conventional
warheads, and therefore reject making them part of the START pact.
   The Soviets responded by proposing a joint experiment to be
conducted in the Mediterranean Sea to test the new technology
Gorbachev mentioned last December.
   Soviet officials have not released details of the new method,
but a senior administration official said March 17 that ``it seemed
to be just a Geiger counter hanging from a helicopter.'' Such a
device would be easy to fool, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   However, said the official, the administration ``was considering
going along with the experiment, just to see what they have.''
   On Friday, a State Department official said that the proposed
experiment had been rejected.
   ``The United States stands by the commitment it made at the
Washington summit to find a mutually acceptable solution to the
questions of limiting the deployment of long-range nuclear armed
cruise missiles and to seek mutually acceptable and effective
methods of verification of such limitations,'' said the official,
reading a State Department policy statement.
   ``Designing a regime to verify the effective limitation of
sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM) deployment is an extremely tough
problem. The Soviet proposals forwarded thus far for verifying as
SLCM limit simply won't work,'' the official said.
   ``That means we rejected the idea'' of a joint experiment, said
the official.
   The administration maintains that the Soviet demand to include
the sea-launched cruise missiles stands in the way of a START
treaty.
   Soviet officials have said that a START pact could be ready for
the Moscow summit at the end of May, but President Reagan has said
that the treaty is too complicated to conclude by then.
   A Soviet diplomat in Washington said that question of monitoring
sea-launched cruise missiles was discussed during the visit to
Washington last month of Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
but that ``these negotiations were supposed to be confidential.''
   ``Through diplomatic channels, the U.S. side was supposed to let
us know,'' said the Soviet official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. He declined to give an official reaction to the State
Department statement.

   The wreckage of a private airplane with
seven bodies inside was found Friday in the rugged mountains around
Cumberland Gap, officials said.
   The Cherokee Six Saratoga left Boca Raton, Fla., on Easter
Sunday and was lost to radar contact in the mountainous Cumberland
Gap area late that evening, said Adele Sparks of the Civil Air
Patrol in Knoxville.
   The plane was reported missing Tuesday by the sister of the
pilot, James Cox, 44, of Ridgefield, Ind., Ms. Sparks said.
   The passengers had not yet been identified by name, but were
Cox's wife, his parents, a 13-year-old daughter, a friend of the
daughter's and a 9-month-old child, she said.
   Efforts to find the plane had been confined to the ground by bad
weather until Friday afternoon, when the weather broke enough to
allow airborne search, Ms. Sparks said.
   The wreck was about four miles east of the Cumberland Gap, where
Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia abut, Ms. Sparks said.
   The plane hit the top of a ridge on the Kentucky-Virginia state
line, she said. The wreck was about four miles east of the
Cumberland Gap, where Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia abut, she
said.
   The initial impact sheared off one wing, and the plane continued
for about a half-mile before hitting a ridge on the Kentucky side
of the line, Ms. Sparks said.
   The plane was registered to Cox Engineering Co. of Ridgefield.

   A lawyer for John Zaccaro Jr. admitted
Friday that his client sold cocaine, but said the son of former
vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro was tricked into
making the sale by an attractive female officer.
   Zaccaro is on trial in Vermont District Court on allegations he
illegally sold a quarter-gram of cocaine to the undercover officer
two years ago. The charge carries a maximum penalty of five years
in prison and a $5,000 fine.
   ``The defense will not dispute the allegation that he sold a
regulated drug,'' said Charles Tetzlaff in his opening statement
Friday. ``This is a case of improper and overzealous police
conduct.''
   Tetzlaff said ``an attractive female police officer'' who had
never before acted on an undercover assignment entrapped Zaccaro
into making the sale. He said it was the woman, not Zaccaro, who
brought up the subject of buying drugs.
   When she took the stand Friday, the officer, Laura Manning, was
asked what she said to Zaccaro when she came to his off-campus
apartment in February 1986. ``I said, `A couple of people told me
that you could sell me some coke.'''
   ``And what did he say?'' asked Addison County Prosecutor John
Quinn.
   ``Sure,'' Manning quoted Zaccaro as responding. She added, ``He
pulled a tray from under the couch.''
   Manning testified that the tray had on it about 15 packets of
cocaine in a plastic bag, with the packets marked by weight.
   When questioned by Tetzlaff on her apparel that day, Manning
said she was told to dress like a college student, and was wearing
an open jean jacket, a yellow V-neck sweater and jeans.
   She said she was hesitant to take the assignment because she had
never done an undercover job. She said she was given instructions
on what to wear and what to say.
   ``Did they tell you to ask for cocaine?'' Tetzlaff asked her.
   ``Yes,'' replied Manning.
   After Manning's testimony, the trial was adjourned until
Saturday.
   Quinn conceded in his opening argument that Manning was
inexperienced, but asked jurors to keep in mind that the Middlebury
Police Department is a low-budget, small-town operation.
   ``We don't have huge resources in the state,'' he said, adding
it was even difficult for police to come up with $30 for the
purchase.
   The prosecutor painted a picture of Zaccaro as a well-organized
drug dealer.
   He said that when Manning asked to buy cocaine, Zaccaro pulled a
tray from under his couch with 15 packets of the drug. ``When he
takes a packet off the tray, he opens it up, being the good
merchant that he is ... looks at it, wraps it up'' and gives it to
Manning, Quinn said.
   Quinn also said a detective began investigating Zaccaro after a
note was left on his desk with Zaccaro's name, address, car
registration and the words ``The Pharmacist.''
   Prosecutors and police have said Zaccaro was known at Middlebury
College as ``the pharmacist'' because of his reputation as a drug
dealer.
   The detective, David Wemette, was the first witness. He
testified he had first heard rumors of Zaccaro's drug dealing in
1984, but that he did not pursue them because Zaccaro left to help
his mother's campaign.
   Manning's drug buy came Feb. 20, 1986, at Zaccaro's off-campus
apartment. Zaccaro was arrested a few days later after police
searched his car and apartment.
   Opening arguments followed four days of jury selection, a task
slowed by wide publicity. Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro
Sr., have been sitting side by side behind their son in court.
   The jury is being sequestered to help ensure they avoid press
accounts of the trial.

   Federal employees can donate annual
leave time to superiors who need prolonged, unpaid absences from
work for medical or family emergencies, under a bill signed by
President Reagan.
   There is a statutory ban on gifts from federal workers to their
superiors, which could prevent some officials from benefiting from
leave-transfer programs. The new law allows such transfers.
   It was also announced Friday that Reagan signed into law an
18-month extension of the deadline for filing civil actions
alleging age discrimination for certain claims filed with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
   The bill was passed in response to the failure of the EEOC to
act in a timely manner on about 1,200 complaints that were properly
filed.

<HEAD>Report Says Expedition Finds Classical Greek Texts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An expedition leader said Friday that
archaeologists in Egypt have dug up what may prove to be the
earliest complete versions of three classical Greek texts, at least
one of them by Aristotle.
   Professor Anthony J. Mills said his Canadian team found two
books dating from the late third century A.D., one literary and one
containing farm accounts, while excavating the remains of the
post-Hellenic town of Isment in the Dakhla Oasis in central Egypt.
   The literary manuscript contains a treatise on politics,
apparently by the philosopher Aristotle; an essay on kingship by
Isocrates, his 4th-century B.C. contemporary; and an unidentified
text that could be one of Aristotle's lost works, Mills said.
   The earliest complete texts of writings by Aristotle and
Isocrates that survive in museums today date from the 10th century,
a British expert said.
   The original works of classical Greek scholars have vanished.
What survives are usually separated from the authors' lifetimes by
hundreds of years of copying and re-copying by scribes.
   The new discoveries could bring scholars more than six centuries
closer to the lost originals and eliminate what the Times of London
described Friday as ``generations of slips of the pen.''
   The books, measuring 4-by-10 inches, each has eight or nine
wooden pages one-eighth of an inch thick, said Mills, 51, an
Egyptologist affiliated with the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.
   Mills, leader of a 25-member museum expedition that travels to
the Dakhla Oasis every winter, said the books were found in
mid-January.
   They are written in ancient Greek with a split-reed pen, bound
on one side and held together with the original strings, he said in
a telephone interview from his home in Bodmin, southwest England.
   ``The books are in excellent condition, the wood is good and
hard and the writing is very clear,'' he said.
   ``The one with literary text is written in a very clear, very
small and very precise hand. I would guess there would be 60 lines
on each page, and writing on both sides of the page.''
   The farm manuscript lists local tenant farmers and their
commodities over a four-year period, he said.
   The expedition of zoologists, botanists, ceramics experts and
others examining the links between human activity and the
environment in Isment were short of a classicist at the time of the
discovery. He said they sent for Guy Wagner, a French specialist in
ancient Greek texts who was working in an expedition at the nearby
Kharga Oasis.
   Wagner and a Danish colleague who accompanied him said the
writing seemed like Aristotle's but could not be sure if it was a
manuscript that was already known, Mills said. He said research was
being conducted.
   ``They were very excited,'' he said. ``It's a marvelous find, a
very rare find. There's so much that's new and incontrovertible in
this work. The information is so clearly stated.''
   The books were found about six feet below the surface and three
feet above the floor of a house and may have been accidentally
dropped, Mills said.
   ``We wondered that perhaps they fell out of somebody's
saddlebags as they were going by'' in the 4th or 5th century, Mills
said. The town had been abandoned and was eventually buried by sand
dunes around the sixth century, he said.
   The unidentified text could be one of Aristotle's lost works,
Mills said. Of abvout 150 named works that Aristotle left, fewer
than 30 survive in more than fragmentary form.
   Thomas Pattie, a papyrologist at the British Library, said few
texts by Aristotle have been found in Egypt and most are written on
papyrus, a water plant used by the ancient Greeks, Egyptians and
Romans to make writing materials.
   ``This is written on wood _ not so many have been found _ and
was possibly for school use,'' Pattie said in an interview.
   The earliest surviving fragmentary manuscript containing an
Aristotle work, ``The Constitution of Athens,'' dates from the
first century A.D. and is written on papyrus.
   ``There are several fragments from the second century and this
is apparently from the third century but it may be more
substantial,'' he said.
   ``It might turn out to be very important indeed. These complete
texts could be about 600 years older that the next oldest full
texts.''

   Riot police used clubs and jets of
water to stop a protest outside the U.S. Embassy compound Friday by
about 3,000 people demanding an end to American military bases in
the Philippines.
   Officers attacked when some demonstrators broke away from the
main group and dashed for the heavily guarded embassy. Some people
in the crowd threw stones at police.
   Leaders of the Campaign for a Sovereign Philippines, which
organized the protest, were negotiating with police when the young
men ran toward the embassy.
   Police Capt. Harrison Tolosa said the protesters had no permit
to demonstrate in front of the embassy but were allowed to hold a
rally nearby.
   During the march to the embassy, members of the crowd chanted
``Dismantle the U.S. bases!'' and ``Down with imperialism!''
   The United States and Philippines began negotiations Tuesday on
the status of American military bases, which include the huge Clark
Air Base and Subic Bay naval base. The leases expire in 1991.
   Before Friday's march, the Campaign for a Sovereign Philippines
sponsored a ``Parallel People's Bases Review.''
   It issued a statement Friday urging the government to end the
agreement in 1991 and demand that the United States comply
immediately with a law banning nuclear weapons from its Philippine
territory.
   The group recommended salary and compensation hikes for the
nearly 70,000 Filipino base employees and creation of a study group
to determine alternate future uses for the installations. The six
U.S. bases make up the largest American installation left in
Southeast Asia.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt, head of the American negotiating
panel, says they are essential to protect the region.
   Philippine authorities are expected to demand substantial
increases in the amount of money Washington pays to use the bases.
Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, chief Filipino negotiator, said
last month an annual fee of $1.2 billion was reasonable.

   Eighteen British hostages freed from a hijacked
Kuwaiti airliner got an emotional greeting from their families and
an official government welcome when they landed at Heathrow Airport
on Friday.
   They were brought home by a British Airways jet diverted from
Dubai to Kuwait to pick them up.
   Lynda Chalker, a Foreign Office minister, met them at the
aircraft door and led them to a VIP lounge where about 40 relatives
waited.
   ``Everyone was charging around the lounge trying to find their
family,'' said Mark Appleby, 23. He was returning from a vacation
in Thailand with his sister Nicola and family friend Sue Silcock,
21, when the plane was hijacked early Tuesday and landed in Iran.
   ``There was a lot of hugging,'' he said. ``There was laughing
and crying. It was a great welcome back.''
   Miss Silcock said she would celebrate her return with champagne
and a cheddar cheese sandwich, the thought of which had ``kept me
going throughout the last few days.''
   Simon Pollock, 26, hugged his mother and said: ``It's fantastic
to be back. The only thing I thought about when I was there was my
family, and now that I am with them again it is wonderful.''
   Mrs. Chalker said: ``We learned the lesson that firmness does
pay. We have to resist further hijacks.''
   Some passengers, looking pale and drawn, left the airport
quickly after the reunion, escorted by police, government officials
and airport security to their cars. Some leaned on the arms of
relatives.
   Fred Grant was in such a hurry to leave the airport that he
nearly missed his waiting family and friends.
   Passengers said the hijacking was a frightening experience, but
the gunmen were considerate of the passengers, giving them
blankets, pillows, food and water.
   Scott Stillwell, a 23-year-old photographer, said: ``We weren't
harmed. They seemed very well trained. I don't think they are
afraid to die.''
   David Carew-Jones, 32, said, ``They didn't actually physically
maltreat anybody. On the contrary, they were very attentive. But
you always had to remember that they had a hand grenade in one hand
and a gun in another and they were wearing hoods. ... I mean, there
was always menace.
   ``It could get quite relaxed and they would allow you to talk,
go to the toilet, converse with people _ then suddenly, about once
every two or three hours, they would put the lights out, saying `No
talking,' and they would stand at the front and scan you with
torches (flashlights).
   ``You kept thinking that every time the torch fell on your face
it was somehow significant. That I found frightening.''
   The hijackers, who demand that Kuwait release 17 Shiite Moslems
convicted and imprisoned for bombing the U.S. and French embassies
there in 1983, have released 33 men and 24 women. A total of 55
people, including the hijackers, remained on the plane Friday.

<TEXT>
   A federal jury spent hours poring over hundreds of
documents Friday as it began deliberating the fate of a scholar
accused of trying to sell historic letters and papers taken from
the National Archives and the Library of Congress.
   The jurors quit for the weekend after they spent four hours
considering the case of Charles Merrill Mount, charged with
interstate transportation of stolen documents, including some
signed by President Abraham Lincoln and British prime minister
Winston Churchill.
   Mount, who was born Sherman Suchow in Brooklyn but speaks with
the accent of a British gentleman, faces a maximum penalty of up to
10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   In closing arguments Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Martin
Murphy said Mount stole the papers and removed their identifying
marks. Mount, a respected biographer and Guggenheim Foundation
fellow, claims the documents were his.
   Mount's public defender, Charles McGinty, said the government
tried to paint Mount as a thief because the transportation charge
was hard to support.
   McGinty also said bookkeeping at the National Archives and
Library of Congress was too spotty to prove those institutions ever
owned the documents.
   He said it was only after Mount was arrested that the government
began to gather a case against him. Although Mount has not been
charged with theft, the government contends that Mount took the
papers.
   ``What problem do they have alleging theft?'' McGinty asked the
jurors in U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel's court. ``Plenty.''
   Mount, who is 59 and favors a gray bowler hat, a British accent
he attributes to Irish neighbors in Brooklyn and dapper suits from
the Salvation Army, says he was impoverished after the government
seized his savings.
   During the trial he lodged at a YMCA until Thursday, when the
judge found him in contempt of court. She sent him to jail for the
rest of the trial after he twice asked the prosecutor ``have you no
shame?'' The finding was lifted Friday afternoon and Mount returned
to the Y, McGinty said.
   Mount is accused of selling a Boston bookshop letters written by
artist James McNeill Whistler, Churchill and author Henry James
that belonged to the Library of Congress.
   He was arrested while allegedly trying to sell letters and
papers taken from the National Archives and signed by Lincoln and
Civil War generals.
   Mount maintained that he bought the Whistler papers at Paris
shops in the 1950s and 1960s and that a priest in Ireland gave him
the Civil War papers in a cookie tin in 1961.
   The defense noted that Mount over the years donated many of his
papers to the Library of Congress. He has written biographies of
painters John Singer Sargent, Gilbert Stuart and Claude Monet, and
held a Guggenheim fellowship in 1956.

   A former officer convicted in a cocaine-conspiracy
case that damaged the Miami police department's reputation was
sentenced Friday to 15 years in federal prison.
   Mario Carballo, 32, was found guilty Feb. 9 on two counts of
racketeering conspiracy and three drug counts. Assistant U.S.
Attorney Michael P. Sullivan asked U.S. District Judge Kenneth L.
Ryskamp to sentence Carballo to 20 years in prison plus a fine, but
Ryskamp levied no fine.
   Defense attorney Laurie Beloff asked for a comparatively light
sentence. She told the court Carballo had a distinguished career
and was not accused, as were other defendants, of taking part in
murder plots.
   On Thursday, Ryskamp sentenced another former officer, Osvaldo
Coello, to 35 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. That was the
severest sentence for any of the defendants convicted in the
cocaine-corruption scandal that became known as the Miami River
Cops cases.
   Coello was acquitted of violating the civil rights of three men
who drowned in the Miami River during a raid on a drug boat.
Carballo was not implicated in that incident.
   Of 22 defendants, 16 have pleaded guilty to one or more counts
and some of them have testified for the government. Three, Coello,
Carballo and Ricardo Aleman, requested jury trials and were found
guilty. Three other people named in the indictments are fugitives.

   Here is the text of a statement read
Friday by television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who was defrocked
by the Assemblies of God:
   I wish to express to all the state and national officials of the
Assemblies of God my sincere appreciation for the kindness and
consideration they have shown me in the midst of a very trying
situation.
   They have conducted themselves as Christian gentlemen. We
appreciate that. I would like to believe that I understand the
difficulties and problems the Assemblies of God officials face,
respecting the guidelines for rehabilitation. I have tried to put
myself in their shoes and I can find no fault with the decision.
Admittedly I had hoped the decision would have gone in another
direction, but I do understand their reasoning.
   We are seeking God almost continuously and, of course, our
immediate concern is to salvage the ministry. We believe that to
stay out of the pulpit for a year would totally destroy the
television ministry and greatly adversely impact the college.
Because of the nature of this situation, we are forced to take a
position that does not answer all the questions nor solve all the
problems, but we feel we have no alternative or choice. Therefore,
I must regretfully withdraw from the Assemblies of God,
understanding that they will have no choice except to dismiss me
from the fellowship since I am presently not in good standing with
the fellowship. Even though it is a moot point at this time, I
continue to abide by the original directives of the Louisiana
District.
   This in no way is meant to imply rebellion against the decision
of the General Presbytery. I greatly appreciate the kindness and
consideration shown to me by the brethern of the Louisiana
district. I ask that the supporters of this ministry and the
ministers of the Assembly of God remember us in prayer. Our
position will not be easy and it will take a miracle of God for the
situation to improve.
   I want all concerned to know that I in no way mean to place
myself in a position of defying the Assemblies of God or its
officers. That is not my intention in any way. I will never say a
derogatory thing about the Assemblies of God. We would never want
to do anything that would prove harmful to this great fellowship. I
love this Assemblies of God fellowship that I have been associated
with for so long. I still feel it is among the greatest fellowships
on the face of the earth. It is our every intention to be of
service as much as possible. I would pray that my ministry can
continue to channel many of the souls God would help us to win into
Assemblies of God churches. They could have no better home. I will
always be Assemblies of God in spirit and in doctrine and even
though what help we can give will be from a distance we will
continue to do what we can.
   I sincerely apologize to the officials of the Assemblies of God
and all its ministers of the Gospel for any and all concerns and
burdens that have come about because of my personal failure. Mere
words do not help much and I wish it were possible to erase the
ledger and start over again but of course it is not.
   Perhaps in God's gracious wisdom and his loving kindness he will
help us to solve problems regarding the continuation of the
ministry God has given us. These problems are unsolvable without
God's help.

   Soldiers wounded nine Arabs in street battles
after weekly Moslem prayers Friday, and a firebomb was hurled at
the home of a U.S. consulate official in Arab east Jerusalem, but
no one was injured.
   Most protests dispersed quickly on what proved one of the
quieter Moslem sabbaths in four months of Palestinian unrest.
   Consulate spokesman David Good said the firebomb was tossed at
7:30 p.m. while his 5-year-old daughter and two maids were in the
house. He said it damaged the porch but caused no injuries.
   A guard protecting the house was in the back of the building at
the time of the attack, Good said. He said consulate officials
decided to provide him with a guard several days ago because of
growing tensions in the area.
   Arab youths chanted anti-Israeli slogans, raised black mourning
flags and threw rocks at soldiers after services at mosques in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which have been swept by
violence since Dec. 8.
   A prayer leader at the sacred Al Aqsa mosque condemned the peace
plan of Secretary of State George P. Shultz. ``It is known that the
United States does not give people their true rights,'' said
Muhammed Siam.
   A military official said the army continued investigating the
death of a 15-year-old Jewish girl in a clash with Arabs on
Wednesday.
   It was first reported that the girl, Tirza Porat, died from a
stone thrown by Arabs. But Israel television, citing an army
investigation, said Friday she apparently was shot to death.
Results of the army probe leaked to Israel TV and radio indicated
she may have been shot inadvertently by an Israeli.
   Arab hospital officials reported nine Palestinians wounded by
soldiers Friday in four separate clashes in the West Bank and Gaza,
which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   The largest toll was at the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza, where
worshipers emerged from a mosque and marched to an Israeli military
base. Palestinian reports said they hurled rocks at soldiers, who
responded with tear gas and gunfire, wounding five.
   On Jerusalem's Temple Mount, the sacred hill Arabs call Haram al
Sharif, dozens of Palestinians chanted nationalist slogans after
noon prayers at Al Aqsa and paraded with a black flag to mourn
Arabs killed in the violence.
   At least 141 Palestinians have died since Dec. 8, according to
U.N. figures. An Israeli soldier was stabbed to death and Miss
Porat was the first Israeli civilian killed.
   ``With our blood and spirit, we will redeem you, Palestine!''
the demonstrators at Al Aqsa chanted. Youngsters threw rocks at
border police perched on rooftops with sniper rifles, but were
dispersed without incident.
   Inside the mosque, prayer leader Siam urged worshipers to reject
the U.S. peace initiative.
   ``Give yourselves to Allah, but not to Shultz,'' Siam said. ``He
is not the person to decide what is good and what is bad for us.''
   In the West Bank village Beit Ummar near Hebron, an army
bulldozer plowed into shops after a demonstration, said Mustafa
Natshe, the former mayor of Hebron. Army officials said they had no
report of the incident.
   Shultz headed home Friday after an unsuccessful five-day effort
to arrange negotiations between Israeli and Arab leaders.
Palestinians accused him of trying to crush the rebellion with his
peace effort.
   A senior military official said Friday the army still had not
determined what killed Tirza Porat, who was on a Passover holiday
hike with other teen-age children of Jewish settlers in the
occupied West Bank. Two Arabs also were killed, and two Arabs and
13 Israelis injured.
   ``We know she was struck by a bullet and a stone,'' the official
told The Associated Press. ``The exact cause of death is not
known.''
   According to an army report leaked to Israeli radio and
television, the clash began when 16 teen-agers and their two guards
were stoned by youths from Beita, an Arab town.
   The radio quoted the report as saying the guards disagreed over
what to do. It said Romam Al Dubi, 26, wanted to shoot but the
other guard asked him not to.
   Al Dubi told the children to gather around him and started
shooting, the radio said, then the Arab youths disarmed him and
took the Israelis to Beita.
   A large crowd attacked the Israelis in the town, reports have
said, but the army stressed that many villagers helped the
teen-agers.
   Israeli media reports have identified Al Dubi as a follower of
the anti-Arab Kach movement of U.S.-born Rabbi Meir Kahane.
   Israel television, quoting a ranking military source it did not
identify, said the bullet in Miss Porat's head was fired from the
gun of one of the Israeli guards but it was not known who pulled
the trigger.
   The army said a Beita resident on Friday handed Al Dubi's M-16
rifle to a soldier, and TV reports said eight bullets were still in
the magazine.
   Israel radio quoted an army report as saying Ms. Porat was also
struck in the head by a rock hurled by the mother and sister of an
Arab killed in the clash. The two women are under arrest, the
report was quoted as saying.
   Beita remained under curfew Friday. The army said soldiers
demolished eight more homes of suspects, bringing the two-day total
to 13.

   Syrian-backed Amal militiamen claimed
victory in south Lebanon on Friday after four days of clashes with
rival Iranian-backed Shiite fighters which left 62 dead and 150
wounded, police said Friday.
   The Syria-backed Amal militia led by Justice Minister Nabih
Berri apparently had battled the more militant Hezbollah, or Party
of God, which is loyal to Iran.
   Amal won the key town of Ghaziyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold, in a
sweeping attack Thursday after its fighters took control of the
inland market town of Nabatiyeh.
   Police said two West German relief workers who were held captive
for 14 hours by Hezbollah were freed Thursday when Amal militiamen
took Ghaziyeh.
   The Amal commander in Nabatiyeh, Mahmoud Faqih, said the
crackdown on Hezbollah was ``inevitable.''
   ``They were harrassing the population, kidnapping innocent
people and confiscating property owned by the Christians,'' a
minority in the area, Faqih told The Associated Press at his
bullet-riddled office in Nabatiyeh.
   Hezbollah forces, loyal to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
remained entrenched in three hamlets west of Nabatiyeh with Shiite
mediators negotiating terms for their surrender.
   Trouble between Amal and Hezbollah began Feb. 17, when Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins, the U.S. Marine who commands U.N. truce
observers, was kidnapped near Tyre and Amal rounded up dozens of
Hezbollah members it accused of involvement.
   Shiite militants loyal to Iran are believed to hold most of the
22 foreign hostages in Lebanon, who include nine Americans. Held
longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The West Germans, who work for a West German humanitarian
organization identified as Asme Humanitas, disappeared after
leaving the Palestinian refugee camp of Mieh Mieh in Sidon
Wednesday morning, police said.
   They were identified as Heinrich Strubig, 47, the director of
the organization in Mieh Mieh, and his assistant, Petra Schnitzler,
24, of Hamburg.
   Ms. Schnitzler suffered bullet shrapnel cuts on one hand and
burns from another bullet that grazed her left wrist. She told The
Associated Press that she and Strubig were riding in an ambulance
to distribute food and medicine when they were stopped.
   ``We were intercepted by armed men in at least two cars, who
fired several shots over our vehicle,'' she said.
   Police said the West Germans had been held in the basement of a
mosque.

<HEAD>Meese Backs Anti-Drug Force in Ecuador Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III
called anew on Friday for a multinational force to combat global
drug trafficking.
   He addressed a news conference in Quito following his arrival in
Ecuador on Thursday night.
   The U.S. Embassy said Meese canceled a visit Friday to an
anti-drug operations site in the Ecuadorean Amazon jungle and
instead toured a police academy.
   He is scheduled to fly to Guayaquil, Ecuador, on Saturday for a
meeting with President Leon Febres Cordero before traveling on to
Peru and Bolivia.
   Meese is accompanied by John Lawn, head of the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration, on a fact-finding mission to measure
the success of Latin American nations' efforts to halt cocaine
trafficking.
   He told reporters Friday the proposal for a multinational
anti-drug force was ``favorably received'' in his meetings with
government officials in the Dominican Republic and Colombia before
coming here.
   ``This is an idea that has a lot of merit and should be explored
in the future,'' Meese said.
   DEA officials say Ecuador's role in cocaine trafficking is less
significant than that of its Andean neighbors.
   Production of coca leaf, the raw ingredient of cocaine, is on a
minor scale in Ecuador. But in recent years international drug
smugglers have begun using this small nation, wedged between
Colombia and Peru, as an important transshipment point.
   Peru is the world's largest grower of coca leaf. Most of its
production is partially refined and smuggled into Colombia, where
the drug is refined into pure cocaine for export to U.S. and
European markets. Bolivia is the second biggest grower and a major
refiner as well.
   Reagan administration officials have praised Febres Cordero for
his commitment to the battle against drugs, and Congress has
increased funding for the fight.

   The first American-made Honda cars imported to
Japan arrived Friday and were welcomed with a party on the ship
that brought them.
   Makoto Tanaka, spokesman for Honda Motor Co., said about 350
people attended a one-hour reception aboard the auto carrier Green
Bay, including U.S. Embassy personnel and Japanese government
officials.
   The ship's cargo was 540 Honda Accord coupes and 100 motorcycles
from Honda's plant in Marysville, Ohio, he said.
   Tanaka quoted Koichiro Yoshizawa, vice president of Honda, as
saying the arrival of Honda cars produced in the United States was
``the first concrete step'' by Japan's third-largest automaker to
meet ``flexibly'' an increasing worldwide demand for vehicles.
   Honda has said it plans to bring 4,000 American-made Hondas to
Japan in 1988 and hopes for annual sales of 50,000 by 1991.
   Atsushi Kawashima of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said Honda's importation plan was ``a very good action.''
   ``As a result of the yen's appreciation, it is natural that
Japan's imports be increased ... and that things like that are
happening during a major trend of imports flowing into Japan'' more
rapidly, he said.
   The yen has doubled in value against the dollar in three years,
making dollar-denominated imports cheaper.
   Last year, vehicle sales in Japan rose 9.9 percent to a record
4.5 million. Honda sold about 365,000, far behind Toyota with 1.9
million and Nissan with 1 million.
   Imported Accord coupes will be sold in Japan for about 2.6
million yen ($20,800) beginning April 22, a Honda official said.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition leader who led a huge
rally against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega last month has been
released from prison and ordered out of the country, his lawyer
said Friday.
   Carlos Ernesto Gonzalez de la Lastra, 49, was freed Thursday
night after being held for 10 days in El Modelo Prison following
his arrest March 28 when police stopped the protest march he was
leading.
   Alvin Weeden, his attorney, said Gonzalez would stay at the
Vatican Embassy until leaving Sunday with his wife, Vilma for exile
in Venezuela.
   ``There was no other remedy,'' said Weeden. He said Gonzalez
faced a long prison term on a sedition charge filed by the
government last summer if he did not accept exile.
   Noriega commands Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces and
controls the civilian government. He has been indicted on narcotics
trafficking charges in the United States, which has supported a
10-month-old opposition campaign to oust him.
   The Reagan administration invoked more economic sanctions Friday
on Panama, including a tighter freeze on Panamanian assets in the
United States. Although assets already were frozen by court order
sought by the administraton, the new action has the effect of law
and prevents Noriega from overturning the freeze by appealing the
court order.
   The new sanctions also include prohibiting payments to the
regime by all people and organizations in the United States and by
U.S. citizens and organizations in Panama.
   The previous sanctions, which included the withholding of U.S.
payments to the Panama Canal Commission, created a severe cash
shortage in Panama, which uses the U.S. dollar as its currency.
   Gonzalez was free on bond on the sedition charge when he was
arrested during the demonstration that preceded a police raid on an
opposition headquarters at Panama City hotel. In all, more than 40
people were picked up in the sweep, including eight foreign
journalists.
   The reporters were freed within hours and most of the others
were released the next day. But the government kept Gonzalez in
custody and refused to let anyone except his wife visit him. She
said he had been beaten.
   ``They never filed (new) charges against Carlos Ernesto,'' said
Weeden. ``But state security adduced (his guilt) from a photo of
Carlos Ernesto carrying a flag in the March 28 demonstration that
was published in a North American newspaper.''
   A former director of the now-closed opposition newspaper La
Prensa, Gonzalez was ordered into exile in 1976 by Gen. Omar
Torrijos, who preceded Noriega as Panama's military strongman.
Gonzalez spent two years in Venezuela before being allowed to
return.
   Gonzalez is one of 35 directors of the National Civic Crusade, a
coalition of some 200 business, labor, professional and political
groups that has been seeking Noriega's ouster since last June.
   Carrying a large Panamanian flag, he led the march last month
that police and soldiers broke up with tear gas, shotguns and
rubber truncheons. About 10,000 people took part in the protest.
   Since last month's demonstration, Noriega's regime has harassed
and briefly detained a number of other opposition leaders,
surrounding the homes of at least three of them with state security
agents for periods of up to 12 hours.
   Most leaders of the Civic Crusade have kept a low profile. News
conferences, which used to be held almost daily, have been replaced
by telephone calls and communiques slipped into the hotel message
boxes of reporters.
   NOriegas government's new, get-tough policy appeared in part to
be a defiant answer to U.S. economic sanctions and diplomatic moves
aimed at fortifying the internal opposition's efforts to remove the
general.
   The Reagan administration completed a 1,300-man military
build-up in Panama on Thursday. The new troops brought to 11,800
the number of U.S. military personnel guarding the Panama Canal,
which has operated normally throughout the crisis, and protecting
American citizens living in the country.
   About 800 Marines arrived Friday from Camp Pendleton, Calif.,
for three weeks of jungle warfare training that the White House
said had nothing to do with the build-up of the U.S. Southern
Command, which is based in Panama. The command is responsible for
all American military operations in Central and Latin America.

   Jesse Jackson, campaigning across the city
boroughs, said Friday he had ``sent a message no one can miss'' to
allay concerns that he harbors anti-Semitic feelings, and he moved
to counter criticism that he lacks the government experience to be
president.
   ``Our own commitment is to end any vestiges of racism, of
anti-Semitism, or sexism,'' he said, and in one appearance he
described the link between blacks and Jews during the civil rights
movement. Growing up in the South, Jackson said, ``it was
commonplace to see signs that said `blacks and Jews and dogs are
not welcome.'''
   Jackson will not, however, meet with a Jewish umbrella group to
address their concerns, said Gerald Austin, Jackson's campaign
manager.
   The National Jewish Community Relations Council had sought such
a meeting, but Austin said Jackson could not take the time from his
campaign for New York's April 19 primary.
   ``We've already answered all these questions. I don't see why we
have to go to a meeting to answer all the questions again,'' Austin
said outside of a fund-raiser in Wading River, on Long Island.
   ``We're talking to the people in New York City. A lot of them
happen to be Jewish. We are talking about issues that are important
to us as opposed to the issues that are important to one group of
people,'' he added.
   Concerning his lack of experience in office, Jackson told a
senior citizens forum in Garden Grove, Long Island that he would
recruit government officials to his administration and ``put
together a competent and credible management team'' and cabinet.
   ``Some office holders are not leaders and some leaders are not
office holders,'' he said. ``...I am a leader.''
   One of Jackson's two Democratic rivals, Sen. Albert Gore Jr.,
told the same forum that he does not intend to stop making
experience an issue in the campaign. He cited his own credentials
as a member of Congress and leader on various legislative matters
of concern to the seniors.
   Jackson listed various economic proposals: to freeze the
military budget, create a merger review board for corporate mergers
and invest public pension funds in housing construction projects.
   In earlier remarks, Jackson discussed black-Jewish bonds during
the civil rights struggle of the 1960s.
   In a breakfast speech to union officials at Sardi's restaurant
in Manhattan's theater district, Jackson said that during his youth
in the South, ``It was commonplace to see signs that said `blacks
and Jews and dogs are not welcome.'''
   He also spoke of people who were killed during the civil rights
years. He cited the shooting deaths of three white civil rights
workers in Mississippi in the early 1960s, pointedly noting that
two of them were Jewish.
   Many Jewish voters, a large and active voting bloc in New York's
critical April 19 primary, oppose Jackson's support for a
Palestinian homeland and were alienated by his 1984 use of the
offensive term ``Hymietown'' to describe New York City. Moreover,
they are wary of his previous association with Nation of Islam
leader Louis Farrakhan, who called Judaism a ``dirty religion.''
   Asked how he would respond to that resistance, Jackson told
reporters, ``We continue to build relationships. We continue to
heal relationships. Ours is an inclusive outreach campaign.''
   Additionally, he said Jews are among many minority and ethnic
groups he has involved in his campaign.
   At the senior citizens forum at Adelphi University in Garden
Grove, a woman asked Jackson to comment on the lack of U.S.
intervention when Hitler was killing Jewish people during World War
II.
   ``We did not act quickly,'' at that time, Jackson replied. ``We
did abandon many Jewish people to Hitler's hell. It was a tragic
mistake.''
   Jackson went on to mention two issues of key importance to
Jewish voters. He said Americans must fight for the right of Soviet
Jews to emigrate, and for the right of Israel to exist and be
assured of security.
   Jackson, whose once poor campaign has seen a dramatic boost in
fund-raising, took a veiled swipe at the fat checkbook of rival
Michael Dukakis, telling the labor breakfast, ``You can have the
greatest fund raisers going, and no message and no vision _ and
then what.''
   Jackson also spoke to an enthusiastic crowd at a high school in
Wyandanch, N.Y. About 1,000 youth, including band members in bright
green and gold, crowded in the hall to applaud his call for
excellence in academics.

   Jesse Jackson, reaching out to Jewish primary voters in New
York, said Friday he was trying to ``heal relationships'' that
frayed during his 1984 presidential campaign. Republican George
Bush, his own nomination secure, surveyed the Democratic race and
said ``I wouldn't trade'' places.
   The Democrats focused on New York and its April 19 turning-point
primary with 255 delegates, with Michael Dukakis and Albert Gore
Jr. both waging war on drugs.
   Jackson, campaigning in Manhattan, was asked by reporters about
his relationship with the Jewish community, severely strained since
he referred to New York as ``Hymietown'' during his 1984
presidential bid.
   ``Our own commitment is to end any vestiges of racism, of
anti-Semitism, or sexism...,'' Jackson said. ``We've sent a message
no one can miss.''
   A poll released Friday by the Marist College Institute for
Public Opinion showed Jackson was supported by just 9 percent of
Jewish voters. Michael Dukakis was the choice of 68 percent of Jews
surveyed, while Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee was favored by 10
percent.
   Jews make up one-fourth of the voters expected to cast ballots
in the state's contest.
   Jackson would not say whether he has agreed to meet with Jewish
groups, but he said, ``We continue to build relationships, we
continue to heal relationships.''
   However, his campaign manager said late Friday that Jackson will
not meet with a Jewish umbrella group to address their concerns.
The National Jewish Community Relations Council had sought such a
meeting, but campaign manager Gerald Austin said Jackson could not
take the time for the meeting.
   ``We've already answered all these questions. I don't see why we
have to go to a meeting to answer all the questions again,'' Austin
said.
   Jackson has alienated Jews by endorsing a homeland for
Palestinians and because of his close relationship with Louis
Farrakhan, the Black Muslim leader who has called Judaism a
``gutter religion.''
   Asked what his relationship with Farrakhan is today, Jackson
said, ``We do not have one. It is precisely that.''
   One of Jackson's antagonists, New York Mayor Edward Koch,
defended his comment that Jews would be ``crazy'' to vote for
Jackson. ``Supporters of Jesse Jackson are saying Koch can't say
these things,'' the mayor said. ``What do you think a political
campaign is? A political campaign is divisive. Somebody's got to
win and somebody's got to lose.''
   Overall, the Marist poll showed Dukakis leading Jackson among
likely Democratic voters by 47 percent to 31 percent, with Gore
receiving support from 6 percent.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, who has not endorsed any of the Democratic
hopefuls, said the poll indicated to him that it might be a tight
race because he expected both Jackson and Gore to continue to pick
up support. As for Dukakis, he said, ``I don't know how much room
there is to go.''
   Cuomo also revealed that he has already voted by absentee ballot
for one of the candidates, but refused to say which one.
   Dukakis and Gore waged war on the Reagan administration's drug
war during their campaign stops.
   ``This administation declared a war against drugs and drugs
won,'' Gore said in Brentwood. ``They've got to say yes to funding
for drug programs.''
   ``I'd wage a real war, not a phony war, on drugs,'' Dukakis told
senior citizens. ``We've got to get tough on the flow of drugs into
this country.''
   Bush was out on the road again, touring an aircraft assembly
plant in Fort Worth and attending several fund-raisers during a
two-day swing through Texas and Florida. Bush is virtually assured
his party's nomination after Bob Dole dropped out and Pat Robertson
severely scaled back his campaign.
   Bush said he didn't think the Democratic infighting would last
into the fall campaign.
   ``I wish I thought the Democrats would have a unity problem but
I don't think they will. I'm not counting on the blood on the floor
that exists on this moment to carry over and cause the Democrats to
hemorrhage to death,'' he said.
   Asked if he minded not having the discipline of a primary
contest, Bush said, ``I'm delighted it's worked out the way it has.
You offset staying in the news through combat by the luxury that
comes with having the time to deal with issues. I wouldn't trade,
let's put it that way.''
   In Albany, N.Y., the state Democratic Committee's executive
director, John Marino, said some party leaders are beginning to
throw their support to Dukakis. Cuomo and state Democratic Chairman
Laurence Kirwan had urged the 300 members of the state party
committee on Thursday to choose one of the three presidential
contenders.
   ``After yesterday, I got a clear sense of some movement to
Dukakis,'' said Marino. ``By next Monday or Tuesday, we'll have a
much better feeling for that. Maybe there'll be a bandwagon effect
(for Dukakis), but you may have a backlash reaction.''
   Later Friday, however, Cuomo at a news conference said he did
not care whether Democratic leaders endorsed candidates or not. ``I
did not offer instruction to people that they must endorse or
should endorse. Why should I? I haven't endorsed myself. I'm not
instructing or suggesting.''
   Cuomo said he was in discussions with the three candidates about
making campaign appearances with them all, time permitting. ``I'll
go anywhere with them,'' he said.
   Some Democrats in New York are backing an uncommitted slate of
delegates to the party's national convention in Atlanta in July in
hopes of generating a draft of Cuomo to be the presidential nominee.
   Cuomo has said he does not want to be the candidate. But he has
refused to endorse any of the three contending Democrats, and has
not ruled out accepting a draft for the nomination if the
convention is deadlocked.
   Another prominent Democrat who has counted himself out of the
presidential race, Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, indicated Friday that
he has had no second thoughts about his decision.
   Nunn, who announced last year that he would not be a candidate,
conceded that it would be difficult to turn down a presidential
draft at the convention.
   But at a town meeting in Thomaston, Ga., he said, ``I haven't
even thought about that. I guarantee you I haven't spent 10 seconds
thinking about somebody drafting me.''

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers from 12 nations, including the
United States and Soviet Union, announced the formation Friday of a
group that will work to outlaw nuclear weapons and offer help in
disarmament programs.
   The new organization brought American, European, East bloc and
Asian jurists' associations together under one umbrella to
coordinate activities against nuclear warfare.
   Soviet, U.S. and Swedish attorneys were elected co-chairmen of
the International Lawyers Association against Nuclear Arms, or
ILANA.
   The group mirrored the International Physicians for the
Prevention of Nuclear War, which linked Soviet and U.S. doctors in
a campaign that earned them the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize.
   The jurists, ending a two-day conference, said anyone
contributing to the nuclear arms race could be held accountable in
the same way that Nazi officers were convicted of crimes against
humanity by the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal.
   Alexander Sucharev, head of the Association of Soviet Lawyers
and a former justice minister of the Russian republic, said the
ultimate goal ``is to outlaw nuclear arms ... possibly through
changes in the constitutions of our countries.''
   Sucharev, a co-chairman, said the organization also could offer
to help monitor the verification of arms control agreements.
   Speaking through a translator, he said his participation in the
founding conference reflected ``new thinking'' in Moscow.
   U.S. co-chairman Peter Weiss said the organization may help
defend arrested anti-nuclear activists and could sponsor cases at
the World Court in The Hague.
   It also could launch multinational research projects into the
legal aspects of the U.S. space defense program called ``Star
Wars'' and the possible interpretations of arms control treaties,
he said.
   The group believes that nuclear weapons violate international
laws banning the threat of indiscriminate force and the use of
weapons against non-military targets, said Weiss, a New York
attorney who also heads the Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy.
   ``It is ironic that the two most powerful countries in the world
rely for their security on an illegal institution, namely nuclear
weapons,'' said Weiss.
   Asked if he agreed that nuclear weapons in the Soviet arsenal
also were illegal, Sucharev said, ``the reality is that nuclear
weapons exist,'' and said that they should be outlawed.
   Co-chairman Stig Gustafsson, a member of the Swedish Parliament,
said the association will be financed by donations from its member
organizations and by contributions.

<TEXT>
   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart on
Friday announced his resignation from the Assemblies of God shortly
after the church said it was defrocking him for rejecting
punishment it had ordered for ``moral failure.''
   Swaggart said at a news conference that he knew dismissal was
inevitable but insisted he had no choice but separating from the
church to save his Bible college and $140 million-a-year worldwide
ministry.
   Shortly before Swaggart made his announcement, the Executive
Presbytery of the Assemblies of God, headquartered in Springfield,
Mo., said it had dismissed him as a minister for refusing to stop
preaching for a year.
   It had ordered the punishment after Swaggart voluntarily stepped
down from his pulpit Feb. 21, after a tearful public confession of
``moral failure'' before his wife, son and congregation gathered in
his Family Worship Center.
   Church officials and Swaggart have refused to elaborate on his
misstep, but a Baton Rouge prostitute has said Swaggart paid her to
pose nude for him.
   ``We believe that to stay out of the public for a year would
totally destroy the television ministry and greatly adversely
impact the college,'' Swaggart said in a statement.
   ``Because of the nature of this situation, we are forced to take
a position that does not answer all of the questions nor solve all
of the problems. But we feel we have no alternative or choice,'' he
said.
   ``Therefore, I must regretfully withdraw from the Assemblies of
God, understanding that they will have no choice except to dismiss
me from the fellowship, since I am presently not in good standing
with the fellowship.''
   He read from a prepared statement and refused to answer
questions.
   In Springfield, the Rev. Everett Stenhouse, assistant
superintendent of the Assemblies of God, said general presbytors
had read Swaggart's statement before he made it public, so there
was nothing surprising in it.
   Stenhouse said the church and Swaggart parted on amicable terms,
but Swaggart's chances of returning to the church were slim.
   ``It would be a long trail back ... if at all,'' he said.
   Swaggart said in the statement that he hoped his college and
preaching would continue to send people into the Assemblies of God.
   He said he would stick to the punishment decided by the
Louisiana church officials, although it was moot. Under that
punishment he would not preach sermons until May 22, although he
has been ``witnessing'' at church services.
   Swaggart's lawyer, Bill Treeby, was asked if the statement meant
Swaggart would form his own church.
   ``This ministry is an independent church and always has been,''
Treeby said.
   Asked if any of the Christian television networks had contacted
them about taking Swaggart off the air, he said, ``We have people
who handle that. We're not going to deal with that. If some of them
don't use us, they won't.''
   The church's decision to dismiss Swaggart as a minister was
announced in Springfield by the Rev. G. Raymond Carlson, general
superintendent of the church, after he and other members of the
Executive Presbytery met by telephone conference call.
   Earlier Friday, the church had received what Carlson described
as a ``gracious'' letter from Swaggart in which the evangelist
refused to accept terms of a church-ordered, two-year
rehabilitation program.
   Carlson said he called Swaggart on Friday after the 13-member
Executive Presbytery, which serves as the board of directors of the
church, met and made its decision.
   ``He received it graciously,'' Carlson said. ``We had prayer
together at the conclusion of our conversation.''
   In the statement he read, Carlson referred to remarks Swaggart
made in a column in his magazine, The Evangelist, in August 1987.
In it, Carlson said, Swaggart endorsed a one-year ban from
preaching as part of the rehabilitation of any ``fallen churchman.''
   Carlson declined to release details of Swaggart's letter. He
said that when he talked to him, the evangelist did not explain why
he was refusing the rehabilitation program.
   The leaders of the country's largest Pentecostal denomination
and their most prominent minister had been locked in an impasse
since an attorney announced last week that Swaggart would defy a
church-directed one-year preaching ban and return to his televised
ministry May 22.
   Church elders in Louisiana originally recommended that Swaggart
be barred from his pulpit for three months as part of a two-year
rehabilitation plan despite protests from national leaders that
every other Assemblies minister who had confessed to moral failure
was banned from preaching for at least a year.
   The Executive Presbytery recommended the one-year ban and stood
firm through a challenge to its authority by Louisiana officials.
On March 29, the Executive Presbytery's authority to discipline
Swaggart, and the specifics of its rehabilitation plan, were
endorsed by an oversight body, and Louisiana officials later
reconciled themselves to the national plan.
   Swaggart's church, television and school complex in Baton Rouge
has been shaken by the scandal. Donations are reported down, about
100 workers were fired shortly after Swaggart's confession, and
students at the Jimmy Swaggart Bible College are said to be
clamoring to transfer to other religious institutions.
   Swaggart's ministry brought in an estimated $142 million last
year, and his sermons are broadcast in more than 100 countries. The
Assemblies of God received about $12 million a year, in monthly
increments of $1 million or so, from Swaggart for its foreign
missions program. It has not received anything since his February
confession.
   Swaggart has been known for his harsh denunciations of the sins
of others, including PTL founder Jim Bakker, who lost his
Assemblies credentials after a sex-and-money scandal last year, the
Rev. Marvin Gorman of suburban New Orleans, reportedly hired the
men who photographed Swaggart with the woman.
   Gorman, also defrocked by the Assemblies, said the action Friday
involving Swaggart ``further proves the truth of the allegations I
made'' in a $17 million lawsuit he filed against Swaggart in March
1987. In the lawsuit, Gorman blamed Swaggart for destroying
Gorman's ministry.

   President Jose Azcona Hoyo declared
a state of emergency Friday in the country's two major cities after
students smashed shop windows and overturned cars in new
anti-American riots.
   The presidential press office said the emergency gives police
and security agencies wide powers to search premises, make arrests
and hold people without trials in Tegucigalpa, the capital, and San
Pedro Sula, 120 miles to the north.
   It also bars street demonstrations and empowers police to
restrict travel.
   The violence broke out after thousands of students filled the
streets Friday, shouting slogans protesting the forced deportation
to the United States of a Honduran suspected of drug trafficking.
   So many students had left their classrooms by early afternoon
that 100 schools and both universities in Tegucigalpa shut their
doors.
   Shopowners boarded their windows in fear of more violence like
the attack on the U.S. Embassy in the capital the night before in
which five people were killed.
   But looters smashed shop windows, and angry demonstrators
flipped over cars. Police patrols, backed by military helicopters,
sped through the downtown area Friday, picking up young people.
   The government, the principal U.S. ally in Central America, said
would ``will take all necessary actions to maintain order and
tranquility.''
   Earlier, officials forced country's 140 radio stations into a
nationwide hookup Friday controlled by the presidential press
office.
   In a communique repeatedly being read over the new network, the
government urged people to ``repudiate violence'' and ``remain
calm,'' claiming the violence was being secretly instigated by drug
barons, who were not named.
   Troops and anti-riot police armed with pistols and submachine
guns stopped pedestrians throughout the capital Friday afternoon
and arrested those without their national identification cards.
   The heavy police presence prevented protesters from staging
prolonged demonstrations. About 1,000 students who planned a
protest near the president's office at about 4 p.m. (6 p.m. EDT)
scattered as a large contingent of riot police arrived. No one was
arrested.
   One government official, speaking on condition he was not
identified, said that ``numerous persons have been detained and
remain in public security jails.'' He did not give a number.
   A tense calm prevailed in the capital Friday night. Army tanks
rumbled through the deserted streets.
   About 2,000 university students attacked two U.S. Embassy annex
buildings Thursday night and set both ablaze.
   They were dispersed with bullets, beatings and tear gas. Police
said five people were killed, four men and a young girl, and at
least 10 wounded. No Americans were injured.
   About 25 automobiles belonging to embassy personnel were doused
with gasoline and set afire Thursday.
   The students were protesting the arrest and delivery to the
United States this week of a Honduran accused of drug trafficking
and involvement in the killing of U.S. narcotics agent. They also
expressed anger at President Reagan's dispatch of additional
American troops to Honduras last month.
   Beginning at dawn Friday, Azcona met almost continuously with
his Cabinet and Gen. Humberto Regalado Hernandez, the armed forces
chief.
   On Tuesday, soldiers and police took Juan Ramon Matta
Ballasteros from his luxurious Tegucigalpa home before dawn and
hustled him onto a plane to the Dominican Republic without a
passport.
   Dominican Republic officials put Matta on a New York-bound
flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by U.S. marshals,
according to U.S. law enforcement officials.
   Matta, held at the maximum-security federal prison in Marion,
Ill., was wanted by U.S. officials for questioning in the 1985
slaying in Mexico of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Adminstration agent,
Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   Honduran legislators called the incident a ``kidnapping'' and
the Foreign Ministry launched an investigation. Honduras has no
extradition treaty with the United States and the constitution
forbids the extratition of Honduran citizens.
   Student protesters also were demonstrating against the presence
of 3,200 U.S. troops in Honduras last month.
   President Reagan dispatched them at Azcona's request after a
reported incursion into Honduras by Nicaraguan troops pursuing
Contra rebels.
   Matta's capture followed the departure of the American military
contingent by less than a week.
   Honduras is a cornerstone of U.S. policy in Central America.
Thousands of American troops have held joint exercises with the
Honduran military on a regular basis for five years.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley said Friday the Reagan administration was puzzled by amount
of time it took police to arrive on the scene Thursday evening.
   ``We do not understand the slow response. We are highly
concerned over the threat this posed to American and Honduran lives
and the destruction of American property,'' she said, and the
matter had been taken up with Honduran authorities.
   About 20 Honduran guards on duty at the embassy compound opened
fire with sawed-off shotguns Thursday night, according to police,
but the students got into the parking lot. Riot squads, totaling
about 50 men, did not arrive until about two hours later.

   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ President P.W. Botha of South
Africa came to Windhoek with senior members of his Cabinet on
Thursday for talks with leaders of the territorial government, many
of whom are demanding abolition of all apartheid-style legislation.
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a prominent foe of apartheid, and other
southern African Anglican bishops also are here for a weeklong
visit that includes church services in the densely populated far
north of the territory, commonly known as Namibia.
   It is Botha's first official visit to Windhoek since June 1985,
when the unelected, multiriacial government was installed to
provide limited self-rule over the territory.
   In the ensuing three years, the so-called ``transitional
government'' failed to win international recognition, and the
United Nations continued to call for independence elections that
would include the South-West African People's Organization
guerrilla movement.
   The United Nations has designated SWAPO the ``sole and authentic
representative of the Namibian people,'' and most observers feel it
would win a U.N.-supervised election.
   During the past three years, four of the six parties in the
territorial government have grown increasingly adamant in demanding
a total break from apartheid _ South Africa's system of separate
political, social and educational structures for different racial
groups.
   Moses Katjiuonga, chairman of the eight-man transitional
Cabinet, said in an interview Thursday he and possibly other
members would quit the government if Botha rejected their proposal
for a constitution stripped of all references to race and ethnic
groups.
   He said that even if the independence question remained
unsettled for years, Namibians could promote reconciliation and
unity if they were allowed to implement the proposals for a bill of
rights and non-racial elections for regional and local governments.
   Botha must decide whether to bow at least partially to these
demands or side with those who want to retain ``group rights'' _
the phrase used in South Africa to justify racially segregated
structures.
   Group rights in Namibia are backed by the Rehoboth Basters, a
conservative mixed-race party, and by the all-white National Party
of South-West Africa, an offshoot of South Africa's governing
National Party.
   Namibian politicians say Botha is mindful of how developments
here would be viewed in South Africa, where his government is
trying to convince right-wing whites of its steadfast commitment to
group rights.
   About 88 percent of Namibia's 1.3 million people are black, 6
percent white and 6 percent mixed-race. A major source of friction
is that whites are by far the wealthiest group and are allowed to
administer their own tax system to fund all-white schools and
hospitals.
   Botha's chief representative in Namibia, Administrator-General
Louis Pienaar, said Thursday that the Pretoria government would be
willing to negotiate major changes in the tax disbursement system
and would accept for the first time the concept of regional,
non-ethnic elections. But he indicated Botha would insist on
maintaining special protections for racial minorities.
   Katjiuonga, of the transitional Cabinet, said Thursday that
SWAPO would lose some of its appeal if apartheid were eliminated
and might be induced to join negotiations on a post-independence
government.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I, defying U.N.
calls for independence. Botha says his government will not consider
the U.N. proposals as long as Cuban troops remain in neighboring
Angola aiding the Marxist government against South African-backed
rebels.

   A bomb that witnesses said may have
been placed in a parked car by a passing motorist exploded
Thursday, killing a man and scattering debris over a two-block
area, police said.
   The car was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived, said
Lt. F.D. Tacker of the Fort Worth Fire Department. The victim was
trapped inside.
   The bomb exploded shortly before 2:30 p.m., shooting flames high
into the air and scattering parts of the car over about a one-block
area.
   ``It's charred black, the roof is gone and all the doors are
blown open on it and there are no tires on it _ they've all burned
off,'' said Fire Department spokesman R.C. Knight.
   The identity of the victim was not immediately known.
   ``A couple of witnesses said another car pulled up and someone
placed some type of bomb device in the car,'' said Homicide Sgt.
Paul Kratz. ``At this point, we don't know what type of bomb it
was. Obviously it was a pretty spectacular explosion.''
   Witnesses said the victim had parked his car and walked across
the street to a barbecue stand, before returning to the vehicle.
   ``One of the medical officers told one of our people that the
guy had gotten out of his car to get a glass of iced tea and when
he got back in it exploded,'' said Fire Marshal Don Peacock.
   Investigators were trying to gather pieces of the bomb, Peacock
said.
   The car was rented on Feb. 25, Kratz said. Investigators know
the name of the person who rented the car but have not been able to
determine whether he was the victim because at least three people
had driven the car, Kratz said.

<HEAD>Meese Says Colombia Will Try To Resume Drug Extraditions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco agreed on
Thursday to try to resume extraditing Colombian drug traffickers to
the United States, said U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese.
   Extraditions were suspended last year after Colombia's supreme
court, ruling on a technicality, said a 1979 extradition treaty was
unconstitutional.
   Meese and the director of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, John Lawn, met with Barco and Colombia's minister
of justice, Enrique Mutra Low.
   Meese spoke at a news conference at the military terminal at
Bogota's El Dorado international airport Thursday before he and
Lawn left for Ecuador.
   Meese and Lawn have also visited the Dominican Republic and will
travel to Peru and Bolivia as part of a review of what Latin
American countries are doing to stop drug smuggling into the United
States.
   Extraditions are a key element of the fight against drug
smuggling, Meese said.
   The Colombian president agreed that both countries must work to
overcome the legal problems blocking further extraditions, Meese
said at the news conference.
   In response to questions, Meese rejected the idea of an
international police force to fight drugs, the suggestion that
drugs should be legalized and the possibility of U.S. troops being
sent to Colombia to fight drug traffickers.
   The United States contributes $14 million a year to Colombia for
fighting drugs.
   Colombians, often criticized in the United States for not doing
enough to fight cocaine trafficking, have pointed out that it is
Colombians who are suffering the most deaths in the war on drugs.
   Drug traffickers have killed a justice minister, an attorney
general, several judges, two newspaper editors and scores of
policemen and soldiers in the last four years.
   Drug traffickers have threatened to kill members of Colombia's
Council of State, the Bogota daily El Tiempo said Thursday.
   Last month, the Council of State decreed provisionally that
arrest orders be lifted for Pablo Escobar Gaviria, a Colombian that
U.S. narcotics agents call the world's biggest cocaine trafficker.
   The Council of State has not made its final decision on whether
or not to seek Escobar's arrest. Escobar is not charged with any
crimes in Colombia.
   The United States has asked Colombia to extradite Escobar.
   Colombia has not extradited any alleged drug traffickers to the
United States since February 1987 because the Colombian Supreme
Court last year ruled a 1979 extradition treaty invalid on a
technicality.
   Later Thursday, Meese flew to Ecuador. His plane was prevented
from landing in Quito due to heavy rain, but he detoured to
Guayaquil where he was to spend the night before traveling to
Quito, the capital, U.S. Embassy officials said.

   The skull of a prehistoric animal has been
identified as part of a previously unknown species of compact,
meat-eating dinosaur, scientists announced Thursday.
   The skull was misidentified after its discovery in 1942 in
eastern Montana by an expedition from the Cleveland Museum of
Natural History, officials said. It was in storage in the museum's
basement when it was noticed by a visiting paleontologist last year.
   The museum said the skull is from a previously unknown member of
the Tyrannosaurus rex family of dinosaurs, a ferocious meat-eating
animal that roamed the earth some 60 million years ago.
   Because of its relatively small size, the new dinosaur has been
named Nanotyrannus or ``pygmy tyrant'' by the scientists who
identified it. The Cleveland skull is believed to be the only such
specimen of the Nanotyrannus, although teeth have been found in
Montana and South Dakota.
   ``This animal is so different from any other meat-eater that it
merits its own branch of the tyrannosaur family tree,'' said Robert
T. Bakker, adjunct curator of paleontology at the University of
Colorado in Boulder.
   Bakker grew suspicious of the skull's initial identification as
a Gorgosaurus, a primitive and very common meat-eater, during a
visit to the Cleveland museum last spring. He worked with two other
scientists in determining its identity and their discovery was
disclosed in a paleontology publication this month.
   The Nanotyrannus resembled the giant Tyrannosaurus rex but was
only about one-third as large and one-tenth as heavy, the
scientists said. Bakker said the Nanotyrannus probably weighed less
than 1,000 pounds, stood about 10 feet tall, walked on its hind
legs and measured about 17 feet from nose to tail.
   Bakker compared the skull, which is about 22 inches long and 10
inches high, to the size of a brown bear's head.
   He said the Nanotyrannus had the same level of advancement in
anatomical features as the Tyrannosaurus rex, including eye sockets
that faced forward instead of sideways, a wider skull base and a
neck joint that bent downwards.
   The Nanotyrannus head was discovered during a museum field trip
to a farm in Carter County, Montana. The expedition yielded other
dinosaur skeletons in the museum's collection but no other parts of
the Nanotyrannus.
   ``It's very rare to find just the head, very rare. And I hope
the rest of it is out there,'' Bakker said after a news conference
to announce the discovery.
   Michael E. Williams, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the
museum, said there are no plans to excavate the site again.
   Bakker blamed the 40-year misidentification on a lack of
scientists.
   ``There are never enough scientists to study dinosaurs, or
crocodiles or beetles or whatever kind of critter you're talking
about,'' he said.
   The third scientist involved in the discovery with Bakker and
Williams was Philip Currie, assistant direector of the Tyrrell
Museum of Paleontology in Alberta, Canada.

   Alan Rosenberg isn't dead, and he obviously
isn't famous. But that didn't stop the Maine author from putting
his unpublished manuscripts up for sale Thursday, entering a market
that usually belongs to the prominent or the deceased.
   Rosenberg was not expecting to pull in the $605,000 that Franz
Kafka's love letters brought at auction _ in fact, bidding on his
works began at $2.75. Instead, he was hopeful of attracting a
publisher for his latest novel, ``Run Red Riding Hood Run.''
   So after 10 models in hooded sweatshirts simultaneously read
excerpts from his book to about 50 people in the penthouse of the
New York Hilton, Rosenberg watched as his literary properties,
including two other unpublished novels, were sold for a total of
$965.
   Rosenberg even auctioned off his collection of 30 rejection
notices from publishers for $65. Also on the block were his
dog-eared dictionary, which went for $40, various photos and
letters, and cassette tapes of his dictated notes.
   ``I'm thrilled,'' Rosenberg said after the sale. ``We did good.''
   ``I read PR releases before I read comic books,'' said
Rosenberg, 34, who freely admits the auction was nothing more than
a Barnumesque stunt aimed at getting him attention.
   ``Run Red Riding Hood Run'' has a little bit of everything:
``There's murder, there's suspense, there's black comedy,''
Rosenberg said. But, as was the case with his books on the second
Claus von Bulow trial and on his experiences at the Boston Herald,
there's no publisher.
   Rosenberg says his publicity efforts have cost him about $15,000
_ ``and it could get worse.''

<HEAD>Prize Winners Not Required To Break New Ground, Board Secretary
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pulitzer Prize board will look into a
complaint that an award was granted for reporting that broke no new
ground, but there is no such requirement for winners, the board
secretary said Thursday.
   A Washington magazine, the National Journal, asserted that
Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Tom Weiner's reporting on a secret
Pentagon budget was built on an earlier story in the Journal by
David C. Morrison and broke no new ground. Weiner won the Pulitzer
Prize for national reporting last week.
   The description of the prize does not require that the winner
break new ground, board secretary Robert Christopher said. The
reporter must only represent ``a distinguished example of reporting
on national affairs,'' Christopher said.
   Meanwhile, Harper's magazine publisher John R. MacArthur on
Thursday also criticized the award, noting that one of Weiner's
stories was accompanied by an annotated document similar to a
feature Morrison did for the January 1987 issue of Harper's.
   ``Certainly, David Morrison did a lot of work and a lot of very
brilliant work on this story,'' said MacArthur, who called The
Associated Press to make his complaint.
   ``It doesn't seem quite right that the Inquirer gets a Pulitzer
Prize unless originality has nothing to do with prize giving these
days,'' he said.
   He said he did not plan to write the Pulitzer board, although he
endorsed the Journal's complaint.
   Christopher said that only he and the board chairman, David
Laventhol, had seen the complaint.
   Laventhol, president of Times Mirror Co., which owns the
National Journal, a 5,000-circulation weekly, did not respond
immediately to a telephoned request for comment.
   Christopher said board members would discuss the complaint once
they had read it, probably next week.
   The Inquirer's deputy managing editor, Jim Naughton, maintained
that ``The series and Tim's work generally has broken new ground,
whatever that means.''
   ``I know it had a reaction,'' Naughton said. ``I know it caused
Congress to re-examine the situation and to ask for more
information from the Pentagon. I guess I would call that breaking
ground.''
   Weiner said he interviewed more than 100 people around the
country and was ``knee-deep in this before I saw David's work.''

<TEXT>
   Nine Soviet scientists head into the Nevada
desert this weekend to set up their first U.S.-sanctioned equipment
outside the Nevada Test Site to monitor U.S. nuclear explosions.
   The Soviet team will monitor two non-nuclear explosions that
will be detonated within 100 miles of Reno at the end of the month.
   ``While they've been to Nevada before, this is the first time
they have had virtually unrestricted visas,'' University of
Nevada-Reno seismologist Keith Priestly said on Thursday. ``It's
quite significant.''
   The Natural Resources Defense Council, an American environmental
group, and the Institute of Physics of the Earth under the Soviet
Academy of Sciences are sponsoring the exchange of Soviet and U.S.
scientists in a cooperative effort they hope will spur a nuclear
test ban treaty between the two powers.
   Verification of treaty compliance has been a sticking point
during negotiations.
   ``Scientists know verification is possible, but for politicians
and the average person, this seems quite complex,'' Nikolai F.
Yukhnin, the head of the Soviet team, said at a news conference on
Thursday less than an hour after the United States conducted its
second announced nuclear test of the year at the Nevada Test Site.
   The first explosion the Soviets will monitor will take place in
the Black Rock Desert 90 miles northeast of Reno on April 29 and
will consist of 10 tons of chemical explosive. The following day,
15 tons of explosives will be detonated at Broken Hills, about 100
miles east of Reno.
   The explosions will be monitored at seismic stations set up
around the Test Site, 110 miles north of Las Vegas, and at a
temporary one that will be established next week near Deep Springs,
Calif., about midway between Reno and Las Vegas. The equipment will
test the stations' capability of monitoring even the smallest U.S.
nuclear tests.
   While the Soviet government plays a role in the Academy of
Sciences, the Natural Resources Defense Council is a private,
non-profit effort. This is the first time the U.S. government has
approved visas for Soviet scientists working with the unofficial
council experiments.
   U.S. scientists, including Priestly, were allowed to join their
Soviet counterparts in monitoring three explosions starting in
September 1986 near the Soviet test site.

<TEXT>
   Sir John Clements, a theater director and member
of a well-known British acting duo, has died at the age of 77, his
family announced Friday.
   Clements, whose home was in Brighton, England, died Wednesday in
a nursing home, his family said. They gave no cause of death.
   Clements, the son of a lawyer, made his stage debut in 1930 and
in 1931 joined Sir Philip Ben Greet's Shakespearean company.
   He became a leading Shakespearean actor and in 1935 founded the
Intimate Theatre in Palmers Green in north London, where he
directed and appeared in nearly 200 plays.
   His career as a producer, manager and actor took him to London's
West End theater district, where he was involved in a mixture of
contemporary plays and plays from the past, including J.B.
Priestley's ``They Came to a City'' in 1942 and a revival of Noel
Coward's ``Private Lives'' in 1944.
   A first marriage ended in divorce in 1946, and later that year
he married actress Kay Hammond. They became one of Britain's best
known theatrical duos, appearing together in ``Marriage a la Mode''
in 1946 and ``The Beaux' Stratagem'' in 1949, which ran for more
than 500 performances.
   The couple also starred in the British Broadcasting Corp.'s
popular radio comedy show ``We Beg To Differ.''
   Clements also worked in movies and directed several TV plays
following the formation of Britain's commercial Independent
Television network in 1955.
   In 1966, he succeeded Sir Laurence Olivier as director of the
prestigious annual drama festival at Chichester in southern
England, where he presided over seven successful seasons.
   British films in which he appeared included Alexander Korda's
``Things to Come'' in 1936, ``Oh What a Lovely War'' in 1969 and
``Gandhi'' in 1982.
   Queen Elizabeth II made him a knight in 1968 in recognition of
his contributions to acting and directing.
   Kay Hammond died in 1980.

<HEAD>Presidents Promise `No Nuclear Race,' Move Toward Joint Economics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANA HAYWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidents Jose Sarney of Brazil and
Raul Alfonsin of Argentina signed accords on Thursday aimed at
further propelling their nations, the largest in South America,
toward becoming a joint economic force.
   They said their venture also ends speculation of a Latin
``nuclear race.''
   Alfonsin, in Brazil on a three-day visit, and Sarney signed
three agreements eliminating tariffs on cars, automotive parts and
more than 130 food products.
   The two neighbors began work in 1985 on a wide-ranging plan to
unify their economies and create a South American Common Market.
   Their project has been slowed by their struggling economies and
huge foreign debts, but progress has been evident.
   With the signing of nearly 25 agreements in all, trade between
Argentina and Brazil jumped from $900 million in 1985 to $1.5
billion in 1987.
   In addition, hundreds of students and professionals from both
countries now exchange information and work together at long-term
joint projects in aviation, transportation, scientific technology
and agriculture.
   For years, Spanish-speaking Argentina, with a population
exceeding 31 million, and Portuguese-speaking Brazil, with more
than 143 million people, were archrivals. They put aside
differences to become stronger economically.
   Sarney in 1985 became Brazil's first civilian leader after 21
years of military rule.
   Alfonsin became president of Argentina in December 1983, the
nation's first elected civilian leader following nearly eight years
of military juntas.
   Sarney said Thursday, ``We are taking new steps in the fruitful
and promising path of integration. We are widening our capability
to compete in the world. We have never had such an excellent
relationship.''
   Alfonsin arrived in the capital city of Brasilia on Wednesday.
It is the seventh time in three years the two presidents have met.
   During this trip, Uruguay was also officially incorporated in
the economic integration after a quick trip by President Julio
Maria Sanguinetti. He met with the other two presidents Wednesday.
   Uruguay has taken part in most of the talks between Brazil and
Argentina and it was expected to join the economic group,
especially since the three countries share a border.
   The nuclear issue has been a touchy subject in the integration
effort. Both Brazil and Argentina in the past two years were
reported to have developed the technology to enrich uranium, a key
step in building a bomb. But both countries say their nuclear
programs are for peaceful ends.
   On Friday, Sarney will take Alfonsin to Brazil's nuclear
experiment center of Aramar, outside of Sao Paulo in the southeast.
Last year, Sarney visited Argentina's nuclear installations.
   ``We are ending any suspicions that nuclear development in
Brazil and Argentina is not linked to peaceful purposes,'' said
Alfonsin.
   Added Sarney, ``A year ago it was hard to imagine that a
Brazilian president would visit a nuclear plant in Argentina.''
   Foreign Ministry officials said details were worked out during
this visit for a future nuclear accord.

<HEAD>Officer Who Waited for Key to Apartment at Scene of Rape Is
Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALUMET CITY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veteran police officer was dismissed
Thursday after a city board found he broke department rules by
waiting nearly 30 minutes for a key while a 12-year-old girl was
being raped inside an apartment.
   James Horka was charged with breaking 10 department rules
stemming from the Dec. 21 incident.
   The Police and Fire Commission found him in violation of five
rules, but dismissed the most serious charge, failing to request
assistance at the scene.
   Horka said he expected to be cleared of wrongdoing and
reinstated after an appeal.
   ``I still think I did the right thing,'' he said. ``No one got
killed.''
   The disciplinary hearings were begun shortly after the Dec. 20
incident, in which Horka and two other officers responded to a call
of home invasion.
   They waited outside almost 30 minutes with the girl's frantic
mother for the landlord to bring a key, rather than breaking in to
rescue the girl.
   A supervisor told him to push the apartment door in if
necessary, Horka testified, but he did not interpret that as an
order. He maintained that he did not break into the apartment upon
arriving because he feared the assailant might harm the girl and
her 10-year-old brother.
   Four officers later broke down the door and arrested the
assailant, police said.
   The two officers who accompanied Horka also have been scheduled
for disciplinary hearings.
   Horka's attorney, Thomas Tyrrell, said immediately after the
decision was announced that he would seek an administrative review
of the decision from the Cook County circuit courts.
   A two-thirds majority was required on each violation. Board
member Guy Eveland found Horka in violation of eight of the 10
rules cited; Chairman Edward Fitzgerald, five; board member Leroy
McGinnis, one.
   The five violations were conduct unbecoming to an officer,
unsatisfactory performance, improper filing of a report, abuse of
command and violating departmental rules.
   Horka, a decorated Vietnam veteran and 14-year veteran of the
force, remained on active duty during the weeks-long hearing.
Tyrrell said he would ask the courts for reinstatement to the force
and any pay lost due to any suspension or dismissal.

<TEXT>
   A van in which three boys apparently were
trying to drive to Florida crashed into a guardrail on an
interstate highway with a 9-year-old at the wheel as police gave
chase, authorities said.
   The boy was critically injured, and his 14-year-old brother and
a 13-year-old friend, all from suburban Trenton, N.J., also were
hurt in the accident about 5 a.m. just outside Baltimore.
   Earlier, Maryland State Police received a call that a van was
being driven erratically on the southbound lanes of the Delaware
Turnpike, just across the Maryland line.
   The van got past guards at a toll plaza and was seen by Maryland
State Trooper Eric Harbold speeding on I-95. Harbold tried to
signal the van to stop, but it accelerated to speeds of up to 100
mph, police said.
   The driver then lost control, and the van veered across the
median strip, slamming into a guardrail and overturning on the
northbound lanes about three miles from White Marsh, police said.
   The boys were taken by ambulance to Johns Hopkins Hospital in
Baltimore. The driver was in critical but stable condition and his
brother was lasping in and out of consciousness, police said. The
13-year-old was not seriously hurt.
   The van belonged to the parents of the 13-year-old, said police
spokesman Chuck Jackson.
   Investigators said they believed the boys were heading to
Florida without permission.
   No names were released.

   The decline of oil wealth and easy credit has
sapped the energy of the Middle East arms-buying spree of the early
1980s, contributing to a $16 billion-a-year drop in worldwide arms
imports, the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency said Friday.
   ``As late as 1984, the trend in arms imports by developing
nations was sharply up in almost all years, fueled by ambitious
force improvement programs, financed, in most cases by rising oil
prices and easy credit,'' agency's annual study of global arms
sales said.
   The oil glut and the Third World's debt problems have forced a
decline in arms buying. Besides, many of the countries who bought
all those weapons in the early 1980s don't need any more now, the

<HEAD>Italian Women Demand Right to Walk Alone in Safety at Night</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 30-year-old woman who was seized and raped by
three young men in Rome's historic center has become a rallying
point for Italian women seeking to be able to walk the streets
alone at night in safety.
   M.C., as the Italian press identifies her, has unwittingly
galvanized a campaign for tougher laws against sexual assault and
challenged the age-old taboo in Italy that women shouldn't be out
alone after dark.
   ``Rome is splendid by day, but by night for any woman who
ventures into the street, it's only dark and dangerous,'' said Tina
Lagostena Bassi, a leading attorney for women's causes who helped
represent M.C.
   In 1986, 1,149 rapes were reported to police in Italy, according
to the latest government statistics, but women's groups say many
more cases go unreported.
   None has attracted more public attention than the ordeal of
M.C., whose rape March 6 in the heart of the capital and the trial
of her three attackers has been front-page news in Italian
newspapers and subject of an editorial in the Vatican's daily
newspaper.
   On March 26, two days after her attackers were convicted and
each sentenced to prison for four years and eight months, more than
100,000 people marched through central Rome in a demonstration for
women's rights.
   M.C. appeared on the podium at the end of the rally, the biggest
women's demonstration in the capital since the pro-abortion marches
at the end of the 1970s.
   ``We want a society without violence,'' Carla Passalacqua, one
of the rally organizers, said as women of all ages from all parts
of Italy, ranging from olive pickers from Calabria to computer
programmers in Milan, marched past.
   ``We're in a very grave situation now,'' she added. ``No woman
can walk the streets alone at night without fear of being raped.
But today we are saying she should be able to.''
   According to police and court testimony, M.C. was assaulted by
three men near Piazza Navona, one of central Rome's most popular
squares, as she walked home at about 1 a.m. after dinner with
friends.
   The three, all in their early 20s, were arrested by a policeman
who happened on the scene. The policeman testified that he found
the three men lined up with their pants down in front of the woman,
who he said was half-naked on the ground, her face bloodied, in a
dark corner.
   ``Aw c'mon, you don't want to arrest us for something like
this?'' one of the men was quoted by Italian media as telling the
policeman.
   M.C. was taken to a hospital, where she was reported as telling
authorities: ``Yes, they were raping me. Two boys were holding me
by the arms and another was trying to do something with me.''
   The woman, with short dark hair and eyes covered by dark
sunglasses, testified in the trial that she could not remember
exactly what happened after the men approached her.
   The defendants, who were described by their families as good,
law-abiding ``boys,'' gave conflicting testimony. One admitted to
having sex with the woman, but all claimed that she had initiated
the encounter.
   The packed courtroom burst into chaos when a defense lawyer,
Augusto Addamiano, said in closing arguments that M.C. decided to
accuse the three of rape ``rather than admit that she was willingly
performing obscene acts in a public place.''
   The judge, Antonino Stipo, ordered police to clear the courtroom
as feminists and the defendants' relatives screamed at each other
and at the lawyers.
   Hours later, the judge announced the three were guilty of rape,
performing obscene acts in public and causing injury. Their lawyers
have appealed.
   ``This trial was emblematic,'' Mrs. Bassi, one of M.C.'s
lawyers, said in an interview. ``It's one of so many cases. But I'm
happy with the attention the trial received. In a way, it's women
re-claiming their rights to go out alone and do what they want.''
   The notion that women shouldn't be out on the street alone at
night was raised by the defendants' parents.
   ``What was that woman doing at 1:30 in the morning walking
around alone?'' Giacomo Putti, father of one of the three men, told
Italian newspapers. ``A respectable person is at home at that hour.
What was she looking for?''
   When a reporter asked why his son was out so late, the father
responded, ``They're boys. A pizza with friends, then they go
around to have fun.''
   An editorial in the L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican newspaper,
criticized the parents for expressing ``wonder that a woman should
walk around alone at that hour, rather than being upset and
expressing pain for the crime committed by their sons.''
   A decade ago the country was shocked by a television documentary
of a rape trial in Latina, near Rome. Defense lawyers suggested the
victim, who was brutally raped by four men, had ``asked for it.''
The defendants were convicted, but given sentences of less than a
year and granted conditional releases.
   The program helped spur a campaign for tougher anti-rape laws,
but rape is still considered a ``crime against morals,'' punishable
by up to 10 years in prison.
   A Senate panel recently began debate on proposed bills to make
rape a ``crime against the person,'' stiffen sentences, allow for
summary trials and permit women's groups to be plaintiffs in rape
cases.

<HEAD>India's Peacekeeping Mission in Sri Lanka Proving Difficult</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   India sent its soldiers to this small
island nation with a declaration of noble intentions: to end a
murderous ethnic war, supervise a peace accord, then get out.
   That was eight months ago.
   The killings have not stopped, the biggest Tamil rebel group
quickly reneged on the Indian-arranged peace accord and the Indian
peacekeeping force of 3,000 soldiers has swelled to more than
50,000.
   Tamil rebels, seeking autonomy or independence for their ethnic
minority on the island once known as Ceylon, are still massacring
civilians from the Sinhalese majority and recently started turning
their guns, axes and arson torches on the previously unthreatened
Moslem minority.
   In addition, as direct or indirect results of the accord, Tamils
are killing fellow Tamils, Sinhalese are killing fellow Sinhalese,
and some young Moslems are taking up arms against Tamils.
   ``There appears to be a strange paradox here: the intensity of
the violence being directly proportional to the increase in the
number of Indian troops,'' the independent newspaper The Island
said in a recent editorial.
   ``It is time that every citizen of this country told the Indians
that if they cannot do their jobs fast enough they got to get out
and leave our problems to us.''
   But defenders of the peace accord say it still offers the best,
if not the only, hope for ending ethnic mayhem on a beautiful
island that was building a booming tourist industry until 1983.
That was the year militant Tamils, chafing under economic and
political domination by the Sinhalese, exploded their cause into a
guerrilla war that has now claimed more than 8,000 lives.
   ``We couldn't have done anything different,'' said Gamini
Dissanayake, Sri Lanka's minister of land development and a key
negotiator of the accord.
   For the first time, he said, the accord specifically and
publicly provided ``a solid understanding'' that the
Sinhalese-dominated government would share power with the Tamils, a
concept that he said was ``just an abstraction in the past.''
   The accord guarantees some autonomy to the Tamils, provided the
rebels surrender their arms.
   However, the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people, fear the accord makes too many concessions to the
Tamils, who account for 18 percent of the population.
   An underground organization of ultranationalist Sinhalese has
assassinated at least 150 people who supported the accord or were
prominent members of President Junius R. Jayewardene's United
National Party.
   The largest Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, are engaged in internecine warfare with smaller Tamil
guerrilla groups that support the peace accord.
   Moslems, who comprise about 7 percent of Sri Lanka's population,
became targets of Tamil rebels trying to dominate the Eastern
Province, where the population is about equally divided among
Tamils, Sinhalese and Moslems.
   Both the Tamils and the Sinhalese are descendents of people who
migrated from India centuries ago, but most Tamils are Hindus, most
Sinhalese are Buddhists, and they speak different languages. The
Moslems trace their religion and ancestry to Arab seafarers.
   Apart from the continuing violence, there is also a feeling that
time is running out to enforce the peace accord.
   Under Sri Lanka's constitution, the 82-year-old Jayewardene has
just 10 months left in office and cannot run again, unless he
pushes through an amendment or a new interpretation of his tenure.
   ``He, President Jayewardene, is about the only man who can put
an end to the situation,'' said National Security Minister Lalith
Athulathmudali.
   Jayewardene's own Cabinet is divided over the implementation of
the accord and the Indian military presence. Although the
ministers' public remarks tend to be fairly circumspect, their
views are well-known _ and can be measured by the bodyguards around
them.
   A dozen men guard the corridor leading to the office used by
Dissanayake, point man in the efforts at reconciliation and
therefore a top target for assassination by extremists in his own
Sinhalese community. The more hawkish Athulathmudali has only a
single guard in sight at his official residence.
   J.N. Dixit, the Indian high commissioner, or ambassador, who
once moved freely around Colombo with a single bodyguard, now has
what he calls ``my rather embarrassing contingent of five gunmen.''
   Dixit, a career diplomat, maintained that India did not take on
more than it could handle in Sri Lanka.
   He said Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government in New Delhi
considered various things that might go wrong with the accord,
including the Tamil rebels' refusal to surrender arms.
   Apart from its regional role as South Asia's geographic and
military giant, India was drawn into Sri Lanka by pressure from its
own politically powerful Tamil minority of 60 million.
   By the Indian government's account, about 400 Indian soldiers
have died in Sri Lanka since the still-unfinished Oct. 10 offensive
to disarm the Tamil Tigers.

<HEAD>Max von Sydow and Ingmar Bergman Return Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After quarrels with the tax collector,
Sweden's favorite theatrical sons have come home.
   Max von Sydow is back on the Swedish stage after a 14-year
absence. Director Ingmar Bergman, who lived in self-imposed exile
for several years, also is rehearsing a new play.
   Both Bergman, whose brooding, introspective films in the 1950s
and '60s gave Swedish film an international reputation, and von
Sydow, Sweden's most durable actor, left the country because of tax
problems.
   Von Sydow, who lives in Paris but comes back every year for
summer vacation, never thought of himself as an expatriate and has
returned twice to make films.
   ``I'm still totally Swedish,'' he said. ``I still have my roots
here.''
   Swedish taxes, among the highest in the world, are driving young
artists away, he said in an interview. The average Swede pays half
his salary in taxes, and marginal tax on top incomes can run as
high as 78 percent.
   ``A lot of talent is not used in this country because of this.
If you don't get anything financially out of it, why work here?''
said von Sydow, 58.
   Among his 40 foreign film roles are the Jesuit priest in ``The
Exorcist,'' the assassin in ``Three Days of the Condor,'' and the
artist@husband in Woody Allen's ``Hannah and Her Sisters.'' He
launched his career abroad in 1965 as Jesus in ``The Greatest Story
Ever Told.''
   Von Sydow left Sweden in a huff in 1973 after paying what he
said was an unfairly large tax bill. He was assessed $20,050 for
allegedly underpaying his taxes. His lawyers took the case to the
European Human Rights Commission in 1985, claiming that the lack of
an appeal mechanism against the tax authorities was an infringement
of his rights. Last year, the Swedish government settled out of
court, repaying him $33,333 compensation and $20,000 for costs.
   Von Sydow said he is trying to put the tax affair behind him
without bitterness.
   ``I'm trying not to be poisoned by paranoia,'' he said. ``Today
I feel freer than when I left, because this problem is solved and
because I know that if I want to I could work abroad all the time.''
   His ties to his country are stronger than others have shown.
Once Hollywood made stars of Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman, they
were gone from Sweden for good.
   Von Sydow is playing at the Royal Dramatic Theater, where he
began his acting career 40 years ago and where he met Bergman, with
whom he did 11 films.
   He said one reason for returning to the stage was fascination
with the character he was offered in ``Master Olof,'' an 1871 drama
by August Strindberg, Sweden's greatest literary figure.
   He plays a roguish revolutionary during the 16th-century Swedish
Reformation. It's a supporting role, but von Sydow said he doesn't
care. ``It's the best part in the play,'' he said.
   He said he also was drawn by the double anniversary of the royal
theater's 200th year and the 80th year since it moved to its gilded
waterfront building, now a city landmark.
   Working in the Swedish language again ``is wonderful, it's
exciting,'' he said. ``It's still very difficult for me to act in
English, and it always will be. ... It takes a longer time to
really make the lines your own.''
   Last year von Sydow, who does three projects a year, finished
``Pelle the Conqueror,'' his first Swedish-language film in five
years.
   The title role of Pelle, a peasant farmhand, could have been
tailored for the tall, blond Swede with a farmer's weatherbeaten
look and huge hands. The role won him the prestigious Swedish
Golden Bug Award as best actor in 1987 and two Danish acting
prizes, one by critics and one by the film academy. The film will
be entered in the Cannes Film Festival.
   ``It's such a rich character,'' he said. ``He is so vulnerable
and so miserable; he is full of expectations, he is terribly
disappointed, he is very happy, he is furious. ... It's probably
the best part I've ever had.''
   Von Sydow also is directing his first movie, a Danish-language
film called ``Along the Roadside.''
   Bergman, 69, is directing his fifth play since returning from
West Germany, where he lived for about five years until he came
back in 1982 to film the acclaimed ``Fanny and Alexander.''
   In 1976, tax inspectors barged into a rehearsal and took the
famed director away for questioning on suspicion of tax evasion. He
was cleared of all charges, but he wrote in his 1987 autobiography
that the incident drove him into a depression that turned to rage
against his country.
   At the same time, he was uncomfortable away from Sweden.
   ``I felt like an invalid who had lost an arm and a leg,'' he
wrote in his autobiography, ``Magic Lantern.''
   ``I longed for the old language, the friends and the
companionship.''
   Bergman's staging of Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night'' reunites him with Bibi Andersson whom he discovered in a
soap advertisement in 1952 and launched as an international actress.
   Andersson, 53, left acting for several years to work in peace
causes, but came back to the stage in 1986.

<HEAD>Art Island Is Cultural Oasis in West Germany's Industry Belt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLZHEIM, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Europe's most talked about
new art museums is a pastoral island that boasts Rembrandts, Roman
ruins and a resident sculptor who fires cannon salutes to Mother
Nature.
   Hombroich Island is a quiet cultural oasis in the heart of West
Germany's most heavily industrialized area.
   ``Art and nature come together at Hombroich,'' says Karl-Heinz
Mueller, a wealthy businessman who owns the Erft River island,
about nine miles west of Duesseldorf.
   ``Hombroich is timeless. It doesn't really have a purpose
because it is not static. Nature constantly changes, as will the
collection,'' says Mueller, a 51-year-old university dropout and
admirer of Eastern philosophy.
   Hombroich is the home of Mueller's private collection of
Rembrandt etchings, Paul Cezanne watercolors, sculptures by
Constantin Brancusi and Alberto Giacometti, Lovis Corinth
portraits, African masks, ancient Cambodian idols and prehistoric
pottery.
   The island has also been the site of open-air concerts by such
world-famous classical musicians as violinist Pinchas Zukerman and
pianist Svyatoslav Richter.
   Mueller's property is also an archaelogical treasure.
   Experts say the ruins of two Roman villas lie beneath the soil,
and there is also evidence of one of the earliest Stone Age
settlements in nNorthern Europe.
   The exhibition buildings are reached by labyrinthine paths that
lead visitors past shrubs and trees transplanted from such far-away
places as Japan and Iran. Hombroich's resident waterfowl float near
a foot bridge spanning the river.
   Ruminating on the links between art and nature is a favored
preoccupation of Mueller, and has led him to adopt some
unconventional art principles.
   He rejects the conventional practice of installing
climate-control systems as a means of preserving his valuable
collection.
   ``The pictures must have a chance to have their own lives, just
like us humans,'' Mueller said in a telephone interview.
   ``What would be better for a human being _ to live in an
air-conditioned room for 1,000 years, or to live normally? Besides,
paintings can live hundreds of years without climate control.''
   Mueller also shuns the normal museum practice of hanging plaques
near artworks to identify their creator and titles. He says signs
would be a distraction.
   Like Hombroich's lush vegetation, works of art also sprout, grow
and bloom on Mueller's 42 acres of Erft River property.
   Sculptor Anatol Herzfeld works nearly every day inside a shed on
the banks of the Erft, producing wooden and metal objects that are
scattered about the island and blend with the landscape.
   He periodically fires grass and flower seeds from his
hand-built, scrap-metal cannon in what he calls a symbolic salute
to nature.
   Since the island first opened in May 1987, tens of thousands of
people have visited, including artists, musicians and intellectuals
who Mueller says are enchanted as much by the serene setting as by
the art collection.
   Visitors pay about $9 to visit the island, but Mueller says
profit is not his primary motive.
   A speculator in industrial real estate, he purchased the Erft
River property in 1982 as a home for his expanding art collection.
He chose Hombroich Island after a long search.
   ``You look for years for the right property to do something
special, and suddenly you find it. It was the law of chance,'' says
Mueller, who refuses to say how much the property cost.
   Mueller hired noted German sculptor Irwin Heerich to design
Hombroich's cubist art pavilions.
   Gotthard Graubner, a prominent West German painter whose work is
also among the Hombroich collection, advises Mueller on his art
purchases.
   Another important partner for Mueller is Bernhard Korte, a
landscape gardener who helped transform Hombroich from a jungle of
wild undergrowth.
   Mueller went into business for himself in 1958, after quitting
university because ``formal studying makes me nervous.''
   ``I started out with zero money,'' he says. ``It took 10 years
until I was able to buy my first art piece. I bought what I liked.
You buy and buy and buy, and suddenly you have a lot of paintings.''
   Mueller says his purchase of Hombroich Island means that his art
collection will be evolving in new directions which he himself
can't yet imagine.
   ``At first I had a collection. It grew. Now I have an island,
where everything has its own importance _ the collection, nature
and the buildings,'' he says.
   ``You do your work, and it changes with what you feel is right.''

<HEAD>Staging Plays In the Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN GUSTAVSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Director Mark Lamos returned from Moscow
with an intelligence report for other Americans who plan to stage
plays in the Soviet Union: Don't underestimate the audience.
   ``The audience is much maligned by many of the theater artists
because they feel the audience is uncritical, is too pleased by too
many things,'' said Lamos, artistic director of the Hartford Stage
Co.
   ``They're pleased by bad theater, by mediocre theater, by good
theater, by brilliant theater. They'll go to all of it,'' he said.
   Last month, Lamos became the first American to direct an
American play in the land of glasnost. In staging his production of
Eugene O'Neill's ``Desire Under the Elms'' at the 1,000-seat
Pushkin Theater in Moscow, he also learned other lessons about the
Soviet Union's actors, theater technicians, designers, directors
and playwrights.
   They may help three other American theater artists planning
trips to Moscow through the Theatre International Exchange Service
of New York: Nagel Jackson of the McCarter Theatre in Princeton,
N.J.; Des McAnuff of the LaJolla Playhouse in California; and
Adrian Hall of Trinity Repretory in Providence, R.I.
   ``I can't tell you what it was like to have a 24-hour difference
between watching my play in Moscow the night before I left, and
being here for the second preview of Richard Nelson's play,'' said
Lamos, who recently opened Nelson's ``Principia Scriptoriae'' at
the Hartford Stage Co.
   ``The difference was that there, you felt a sort of unified
leaning forward and hunger for this,'' Lamos said. ``Here, you look
around the comfortable theater setting. ... People are listening,
yes, but there are some empty seats at the preview, legs are
crossed, arms are folded, people are waiting to be grabbed.''
   But why, Lamos wondered, shouldn't American audiences wait to be
grabbed in what he referred to as ``the grabbiest place in the
world' _ with thousands of stimulants ``from the 32-cable channels,
to the video thing they can rent, to just life in America.''
   Those stimulants are hard to find in the Soviet Union where
audiences come ``eager to hear what's going on in the world, eager
to be moved or eager to be preached to _ frankly, politically.''
   The one play he saw in the Soviet Union that wasn't overtly
political was his production of ``Desire Under the Elms,'' Lamos
said. ``Everything on their stage is political now in a very open
and very critical way, but it still seems like it's 20 years old.''
   Lamos described himself as a ``collaborative director'' who
wants to hear the views of actors, designers, lighting directors
and sound engineers.
   ``I rely on the people I work with,'' he said.
   Lamos had good working relations with Soviet designers,
costumers and other behind the scenes people. ``They, I thought,
were real artists,'' he said.
   However, it was impossible to have the same collaborative effort
with Soviet actors, he said, because they have not yet developed a
sense of mutual trust.
   Lamos said the Pushkin company needs massive restructuring and
its artistic director, Yuri Yeremin, is working toward that goal.
   ``However, the socialist idea of tenure for the artists has
crippled the Soviet theater for the most part,'' he said. ``It is
carrying a lot of baggage ... they would like to lose.''
   Lamos said he was asked by many in Soviet theater how the
American theater is structured: ``How we structure work, how we
treat the actors, how we pay the playwrights, how we pay directors.
   ``They are intrigued by the idea that Americans can pull
together an ensemble company in five weeks of rehearsal, and not
two years of rehearsal for a company of 15 while the other 75
members of the company are stil getting a weekly salary while
you're rehearsing and they're sitting home,'' he said.
   ``I think my way of working was as much a mystery to them as
their way of working was as interesting to me.''

<HEAD>`Hiding of Anne Frank' Based on Different Side of Story</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miep Gies, the woman who helped hide the Frank
family from the Nazis, says it was a long time before she could
bring herself to read ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' even though it
was she who saved it.
   ``Mr. Frank always said to me, `Miep, read it, read it,' and I
said, `No, I can't,' because I was in fear of what I'd read,'' said
Mrs. Gies in halting English. ``But after the second edition, I
finally read it, but only when I'm alone.
   ``Then there grow up something. It was (as) if Anna come into
me. I heard her cry. She was with me. She was here, in here,'' she
said, touching her heart, her eyes welling up with tears. ``For I'm
so very, very happy.''
   Mrs. Gies is the author of her own book, ``Anne Frank
Remembered,'' written with Alison Leslie Gold. It is the basis of
the TV movie ``The Attic: The Hiding of Anne Frank,'' airing next
Sunday on CBS.
   In a tender scene in the movie, young Jan Gies suggests to Miep
that marriage will keep her from being deported to her native
Austria from German-occupied Holland.
   ``All we need do is find a handsome, intelligent, charming
gentleman of Dutch birth, sound of mind and body, financially
solvent with a fairly promising future in his chosen profession,
offering you comfort and security in your twilight years,'' says
Jan, played by Huub Stapel.
   Mrs. Gies, 79, was joined by her 82-year-old husband at a recent
news conference. They agreed that the scene, as well as the rest of
the movie, was quite accurate.
   They were joined by Mary Steenburgen, who portrays Mrs. Gies.
The movie also stars Paul Scofield in a rare television appearance
playing Otto Frank. Mrs. Gies, an employee of Frank, helped hide
his family and four other people in the attic above their offices
for more than two years, until the group was discovered by the
Nazis.
   Anne died in a concentration camp, but her father survived and
later published the diary Anne kept while in hiding. It became one
of the most powerful anti-war statements ever written. It was Mrs.
Gies who preserved Anne's diary and gave it to Otto Frank after the
war.
   Mrs. Gies said she never had any desire to write a book, because
she felt nothing could be more eloquent than the diary. But she was
convinced by Gold that a history should be written of what it was
like in Amsterdam outside the attic during that time.
   ``You must understand,'' Mrs. Gies said, ``it was very painful
for us, but after many difficult _ we gave her the information for
that reason.''
   Lisa Jacobs plays the bright, mischievous Anne, for whom
imprisonment in the attic was especially difficult. Mrs. Gies
fondly recalled Anne as a ``very charming child, lively, but very
curious.''
   ``She always ask us and ask us what happen outside. ... After a
while my husband tell me, you must not tell her all the terrible
things, because it is terrible enough to be in hiding. But she
always ask in a different way until she get the answer she want,
and I lost.''
   Mrs. Gies praised Jacobs' portrayal _ ``She did it very good.''
Steenburgen, she said, played her ``the way I looked to myself: No
panic in a difficult situation. She was right. She was me.''
   The movie is from director John Erman and screenwriter William
Hanley, who teamed on one of the best TV movies of last season,
``When the Time Comes.'' Erman also directed ``Who Will Love My
Children?'' and ``An Early Frost.'' Hanley's credits include the
screenplay ``Something About Amelia.''
   Rather than focusing on life in the attic, the movie portrays
the courage of Dutch citizens who defied the Nazis. Mrs. Gies
insisted there was nothing especially heroic about what she did.
   ``We only did our human duty _ help people who need help. But
there were heroes,'' she said, ``the eight people in hiding.
   ``I can say out of my heart I am so happy that I could give the
diary to Mr. Frank, and Mr. Frank could give the diary to the
world. That was good.''

<HEAD>Venetians Abandon City to Tourists and the Rich</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the world's most enchanting cities
was founded 15 centuries ago by frightened citizens who sought
refuge among its 118 islets in the Gulf of Venice from the
southward invasion of Lombards.
   Now their 20th-century descendents are fleeing in the other
direction, heading back north to the Italian mainland and
abandoning their lagoon city in the northern Adriatic Sea to hordes
of tourists and real estate speculators.
   Venice has become too expensive for its natives and those still
left say it is losing its soul.
   As Venetians flee, the city is trying desperately to save itself
from high tides, floods, polluted canals, erosion and decay.
   After spending hundreds of millions of dollars provided by
special national legislation, planners have come up with plans _
after 20 years of striving _ for movable dikes and sophisticated
sewers to stop the lagoon's green-black waters from doing further
damage.
   The initiative to do something took root after a disastrous
flood in 1966 and the cry of ``Save Venice'' went up. Art lovers
from around the world pitched in to rescue palaces, churches and
paintings from the annual high tides.
   But no one came up with a ``save the Venetians'' campaign and
most descendents of one of the world's most glorious republics
don't live in palaces on the Grand Canal.
   They can put up with stench from garbage and refuse in the
canals, which also serve as sewers, and the winter floods _ even
the summer floods of tourists.
   It is the lack of affordable housing that's forcing Venice's
proud, sea-loving natives to the Italian mainland.
   Alarmed by the loss of regular customers, the city's bakers
organized a conference this winter to discuss the exodus.
   A report prepared by a provincial agency informed the bakers
that in 1951 Venice had 175,000 people, the most ever in modern
times. Last year, the number was down to 83,000 and about one-fifth
of those are older than 60.
   The report predicted by the year 2015 Venice could have only
20,000 permanent residents.
   ``If we go ahead at this rate, they'll be zero,'' said Giuliano
Zanon, a Venetian who wrote the report.
   Butcher shops, grocery stores, carpenters and plumbers have been
closing along the city's narrow, zigzagging streets. Popping up
everywhere _ sometimes four, five or six to a street _ are shops
selling nothing but Carnival masks _ in gold, ceramic, wood,
face-sized and pocket-sized _ as souvenirs of the Mardi Gras
festivities that pack the city with outsiders every winter.
   The mask shops have become a symbol for Venetians who say the
loss of the city's natives is robbing Venice of something just as
precious as its classic paintings and its mosaic-studded Byzantine
basilica ceilings.
   ``Venice's soul is emptying out. It's becoming a Disneyland, a
spiritually poor one,'' said Gianluigi Casini, an architect who has
helped restore canal-side palaces dating back to the 7th-century
beginning of rule by the doges.
   ``When I was a boy, all the kids would be playing in the
piazzas. Now there are few kids,'' said Casini, who at 34 is one of
a dwindling number of young Venetians.
   ``Only old people stay, those who can't go away. There are so
many empty houses. ... (Yet) most of my friends have gone ... for
lack of houses.''
   He lives with his parents in Santa Croce, one of Venice's six
historic districts.
   Some of Casini's friends, married or pursuing professions, moved
to Mestre, on the other side of the 2.5-mile causeway going out of
Venice.
   Mestre, which had about 50,000 people when Casini was born, now
serves as a bedroom for a few thousand people who commute to Venice
to work as hotel maids, souvenir sellers and waiters. Its
population now is about 250,000, triple that of Venice's historic
center.
   Casini is thinking about moving.
   ``I'd like to stay, but it's just not possible.''
   Casini, who supplements his architect's earning by teaching art
history in a Mestre high school, explained that he can't afford
Venice's rents, which are the lire equivalent of $675 to $975 a
month for a two-room apartment.
   By law, apartments should rent for far less under the city's
rent-control program. But as elsewhere in Italy, landlords prefer
to keep apartments vacant hoping for a foreigner or an Italian rich
enough to pay illegal high rents.
   A nighttime ride down the Grand Canal turns up many darkened
apartments. Some belong to foreigners or the rich who come from
Milan, 165 miles away, for vacations or weekends.
   Many other houses are in no shape to live in. Waters lapping at
the front door and sea breezes drifting by the balcony may inspire
poetry, but flooding and salty air constantly erode foundations and
beams.
   Restoration, especially of historic buildings, is more costly in
Venice, chiefly because supplies must come by barge or by porters
who handle small loads on carts in carless Venice.

   In the last few years, however, some young Venetians have taken
advantage of government-subsidized mortgages to buy properties, and
the city has bought many buildings to rent out.
   ``But the city can't buy all the houses,'' Mayor Casellati said.
   Not all Venetians are planning to leave.
   Gianfranco Tagliapietra, who runs a camera shop, said his
teen-age daughter is looking forward to making money in the tourist
business when she's old enough.
   Because of the exodus of Venetians, skilled laborers must be
brought in from the mainland.
   ``To restore a house you have to sell a house'' is a Venetian
byword.
   At the same time, the easy spending of tourists drives up prices
for goods in stores.
   For example, natives complain that a pair of shoes that sell for
50,000 lire ($42) in Mestre are twice that in Venice. Fruit and
vegetables generally cost about 30 percent more in Venice than in
the pricier neighborhoods of Rome.
   ``It's the middle class that's going away,'' said Mayor Antonio
Casellati.
   ``If someone comes back, it's the rich.''
   Disappearing with the exodus is the Venice of old, when
everybody knew everybody else, Casellati added.
   ``In the old days, a doge would live next to a poor person;
Venice's classes were all mixed together. All this is being lost.''
   Even some of Venice's gondoliers live in Mestre.
   Zanon, who wrote the report on the declining population, said
exodus that is siphoning off people has an ironic twist: it began
because the city was too crowded.
   ``If the city had a plan, they could have done something,'' he
said. ``But they didn't do anything.''
   After the 1966 flood, tourism took off, perhaps inspired by the
worry that Venice some day might be swamped for good by the tides.
   By the 1970s, real estate speculators started to move in,
betting that the tourism boom would last. It became fashionable for
big name companies, like Fiat, to restore palaces for headquarters,
banquets or exhibitions.
   ``We Venetians are at our limits to transmit culture; we are
outnumbered by tourists,'' Zanon said. ``My daughter doesn't even
speak Venetian,'' a dialect more lilting than a gondolier's song.
   ``The sadness about Venice,'' he added, ``is not the pollution''
_ or decay. ``It's the politicians who don't do anything.''
   The mayor said he'd like to see a law that would force
real-estate buyers to live in what they bought or rent their
properties for several years only to Venetians. But he acknowledges
that might be impossible in a free-market society.
   In the last few years, however, some young Venetians have taken
advantage of government-subsidized mortgages to buy properties, and
the city has bought many buildings to rent out.
   ``But the city can't buy all the houses,'' Mayor Casellati said.
   Not all Venetians are planning to leave.
   Gianfranco Tagliapietra, who runs a camera shop, said his

   The proposal, which now goes to the Securities and Exchange

   Under the suggested changes approved Thursday, a specialist firm

<HEAD>Retailers Note Healthy March Sales, Stocks Climb</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Many of the nation's major retailers have notched healthy sales
gains in March, while the stock market wavered amid a mid-week
advance.
   The early Easter holiday helped the March retail sales reported
by major retailers, experts said Thursday.
   But although sales were strong for many, including F.W.
Woolworth Co. with a 29 percent jump over March 1987, there were
some exceptions. The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and
Co. reported its sales rose just 1.5 percent during the month.
   Analysts said the stores with lackluster sales suffered from
general consumer caution.
   ``The shift in the Easter calendar should have helped in many
cases to lift sales, but we're still in a very sluggish
environment,'' said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with the investment
firm Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.
   Consumers have spent cautiously since early last year, and
analysts predict they will remain tight-fisted for at least the
first part of 1988.
   In the financial markets on Thursday, stock prices managed to
move higher in an erratic session and add to Wednesday's strong
gain.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had gained 64.16
points Wednesday, edged up 0.50 to 2,062.17. Over the past three
days, the Dow Jones average has gained 81.47 points.
   New signs of stability in the dollar have boosted stock prices
around the world. The Tokyo stock market climbed Thursday to new
highs, having recovered all the ground it lost in last year's crash.
   But the U.S. bond market slipped. Prices of long-term government
bonds declined slightly, pushing their yields up to the 8.75
percent range.
   Oil prices climbed steadily, piercing the $17-a-barrel level in
advance of an important meeting this weekend of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.

   Oil futures prices have edged back above the
$17-a-barrel level in moderate trading, recouping losses recorded
earlier in the week.
   Analysts and traders said the market appeared calm Thursday
ahead of an OPEC committee meeting scheduled to begin this weekend
in Vienna, Austria, even though there have been reports of trader
nervousness.
   Contracts for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, rose 25 cents per barrel to $17.06.
   Among refined products, wholesale heating oil for May delivery
rose 0.39 cent a gallon to 45.73 cents, and wholesale unleaded
gasoline for May rose 0.40 cent a gallon to 48.82 cents.
Longer-term contracts also rose.
   ``We had a very steady and constructive market that continued up
all day,'' said Bob Baker, senior energy analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``The fundamentals look good _ demand keeps edging up, and OPEC
is not overproducing,'' he said.
   Traders and analysts said the session's buyers included refiners
who stepped up their purchases as prices inched above the
$17-a-barrel level.
   ``They saw that the market was getting too high, too quickly, so
they speeded up their purchases,'' noted Madison Galbraith, a
trader at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   In addition, a large money management firm in Chicago reportedly
purchased 3,000 May contracts for crude, a move that was believed
to have absorbed much of the selling in the market.
   The upcoming OPEC meeting has not stirred much nervousness among
traders. Most believe the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries' pricing committee will not take much constructive action
at the April 9 meeting.
   Some market participants had hoped the 13-nation cartel would
act aggressively to stabilize prices and enforce production limits
to curb excessive supplies. Baker said the group likely would only
``issue a bland statement.''

   A Minnesota entrepreneur hopes a computerized
sonar device is the answer for illuminating the rearward blind
spots that plague drivers of bulky trucks and recreational vehicles.
   The blind-spot scanner, which will which cost $400 to $550
depending on the size of the vehicle using it, signals the driver
when a vehicle slips into the ``black hole'' by the back wheels of
a tractor-trailer or other big truck, out of sight of the rear-view
mirror.
   Marketing the ``Vehicle Blind Spot Alert'' is Bill Bartodziej of
Edina, an insurance salesman whose work made him aware of a need
for such a device.
   Many of his clients are truckers who repeatedly have told him of
problems stemming from cars that move into their blind spot, one of
the most common causes of accidents, said Bartodziej, 47.
   When a truck attempts to turn or change lanes with a car in the
blind spot, the results can be fatal for those in the unseen
vehicle and expensive for the trucker's insurer.
   The blind-spot detector employs sensors are attached to both
sides of the vehicle and wired to a small computer on a metal box
fitted below the dash. Two small red lights placed on top of the
windshield indicate whether another vehicle is in the blind spot _
the left light blinks on when a car slips into the left blind spot,
and vice-versa.
   The device also beeps when the turning signal is turned on and a
vehicle is in the blind spot.
   ``It's made me a better driver,'' Bartodziej said of the
demonstration model he's used in his van for several months. ``It's
made me more alert that there are people around me.''
   Motor carriers will be the first big target market for the newly
formed Freeway Technology Inc., based in Edina and headed by
Bartodziej's wife. He also hopes to sell the device to owners of
cumbersome campers and to companies that rent moving trucks.
   With the patent application still pending, Bartodziej made his
first sales at the end of March and put field representatives to
work in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois. He plans to embark on a
national sales effort by August, he says.
   The detector was developed by David Ziembicki of Indian Valley
Manufacturing of Telfore, Pa. Bartodziej, who knew Ziembicki from a
business contact, urged him to tackle the blind spot with some
technology he was developing in work on an unrelated product.
   Bartodziej says all test drivers who have tried it would rather
drive with the detector than without it. And one insurance company
he deals with has indicated an interest in offering lower rates for
trucks equipped with the detector, he says.
   ``We don't endorse any product, but we certainly endorse the
concept,'' said Carol Bufton, president of the Minnesota Safety
Council.
   Bufton said her organization still recommends that drivers
attempt to turn and look for cars that may be in their blind spot.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Mixed in March as Sluggish Spending Trend Continues</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An early Easter helped lure consumers into stores in March,
giving many of the nation's largest general retailers a respite
from their sluggish sales of the past year.
   But experts don't believe shoppers are on a long-term spending
spree.
   Retailers and analysts attributed the strong March sales
increases at some stores to a quirk in the calendar: with Easter
falling earlier in April than usual, consumers did their spring
shopping in March. That made comparisons with March 1987 look
better.
   ``They're not as good as they appear,'' Jeffrey B. Edelman, a
retailing analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said of the
March figures.
   Among the retailers reporting strong sales was F.W. Woolworth
Co., which registered a 29 percent increase over March 1987 sales.
   At the other end of the spectrum, the nation's largest retailer,
Sears, Roebuck and Co., reported its sales rose just 1.5 percent.
   The lackluster sales resulted from consumers' general caution,
said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with the investment firm Seidler
Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.
   ``The shift in the Easter calendar should have helped in many
cases to lift sales, but we're still in a very sluggish
environment,'' Tashjian said.
   Consumers have spent cautiously since early last year, and
analysts predict they will remain tight-fisted for at least the
first part of 1988.
   The rate of spending is crucial to a retailer's bottom line, but
economists watch it for signals of the nation's economic health.
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the gross national
product.
   Apparel retailers continued to have problems because of
consumers' continuing disenchantment with the stores' latest lines,
said Karen Sack, an analyst with Standard & Poor's Corp.
   Sears was among the stores having problems with their fashion
lines, Drexel's Edelman said. The retailer said its sales for the
first nine weeks of the fiscal year rose 1.9 percent over the same
period a year earlier.
   K mart Corp. said its sales rose 8.6 percent last month, and 5.5
percent so far this year. Its comparable store sales _ those from
stores open at least a year _ rose 5.5 percent last month, and 2.6
percent for the year to date.
   Rapidly-expanding Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its sales rose 36
percent in March and 34 percent so far this year. Wal-Mart's
comparable store sales rose 15 percent last month and 14 percent
for the first two months of fiscal 1988.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. posted a 10.2 percent sales increase last
month, and a 5.7 percent year-to-date gain. Its comparable store
sales were up 9.3 percent last month and 4.9 percent so far this
year.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. said its sales were up 28.8 percent last
month and 23.4 percent so far this year. Comparable store sales
rose 10.5 percent in March and 5.4 percent for the first nine weeks.
   May Department Stores Co. said its sales rose 12.1 percent in
March and 6.5 percent so far this year. May's comparable store
sales rose 7.9 percent last month and 2.6 percent year-to-date.
   Montgomery Ward & Co. said its March sales were up 10 percent
and its year-to-date sales rose 4.3 percent. Comparable store sales
rose 7.7 percent in March and 1.9 percent for the first nine weeks.
   Woolworth said its year-to-date sales were up 20.9 percent.
   Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. said its sales fell 0.4 percent
in March and 2.4 percent for the nine-week period.
   Results reported Thursday were for department and apparel stores
and general merchandisers. They do not include sales by automakers
or supermarkets.

<HEAD>U.S.-Made Hondas Coming To Japan, Sign Of New Direction In Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of thriving on a booming export trade,
it might seem odd for Honda Motor Co. Ltd. to celebrate the first
arrival here of U.S.-built Honda automobiles.
   But for the company and the domestic economy, today's
celebration over the shipload of 540 Hondas built in Marysville,
Ohio, marked more than a simple welcoming party.
   For Honda, the shipment signaled maturity for a company that in
two decades has transformed itself from a respected motorcycle
maker into a worldwide maker of attractive cars.
   In a broader sense, the imported Hondas reflected ongoing
changes in the surprisingly robust Japanese economy, which is being
fuled more by domestic demand than because of exports, its
longstanding source of growth.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange has surged back from last October's
worldwide crash. On Thursday the Nikkei Stock Average surpassed its
previous high, which was set on Oct. 14. The New York and London
exchange indexes are still about 10 percent below pre-crash levels.
   Japan's gross national product grew at a vibrant rate estimated
at 7 percent to 8 percent in the last quarter of fiscal 1987-88,
which ended March 31. Official figures aren't yet published. Most
analysts expect it to expand at over 4 percent in the new fiscal
year.
   The Japanese consumer _ the same Japanese whose propensity to
save is legendary _ is changing. The car that Honda is importing is
the Accord coupe, a type of car that hasn't been much favored by
Japanese buyers, who traditionally have gone for four-door family
sedans.
   But in recent years, as the strong yen has greatly increased the
wealth of some Japanese, sportier cars have been selling better,
and the Honda Accord coupe is aimed at that increasing market.
   Still, why not make it in Japan?
   Honda spokesman Bret Anderson explained: ``This particular car,
the coupe, is completely designed and set up by American Honda,
with American R&D (research and development) and engineering. So we
don't have facilities in Japan to build it. It was built for the
U.S. market. We see the car as an American car.''
   The company saw the growing demand in Japan and ``thought that
it probably would sell,'' he said. The company predicts sales in
1988 of the American-made coupe at 4,000, and hopes sales will grow
to 50,000 in 1991.
   The Japanese domestic car market is the second biggest in the
world after the United States, where Japan has an export quota of
2.3 million cars a year.
   Oddly, Honda sells more cars in the United States, about 740,000
last year, than in Japan, about 365,000. Importing the Accord coupe
is part of the company's drive to increase its domestic market
share.
   The U.S. price for the Accord coupe is about $15,000; its price
in Japan hasn't been announced.
   The Japanese economy has spurted ahead on a combination of the
high yen and some pump-priming undertaken by the Japanese
government last spring when it looked as if 1987 might be a
recession year.
   On Thursday, the Japanese parliament enacted another mildly
expansionary budget of 56.7 trillion yen ($453.6 billion), up 4.8
percent from the earlier year.
   The new budget includes a big increase in public works spending,
up 19.7 percent at 7.3 trillion yen ($58.4 billion), to keep
domestic demand high.
   A strong factor fueling growth last year was private-sector
housing investment, which leaped 21.7 percent, according to Fuji
Bank economists. They predicted in early April that the economy
would expand at a 4.1 percent rate in fiscal 1988-89, inflation
would be only 0.9 percent, and the dollar would average 122 yen,
close to its recent level of 123-125 yen.
   A projection by the respected Okasan Research Institute
predicted 4.5 percent growth. The Okasan and Fuji projections
agreed that private housing would stall after its hot performance
in the previous year, but that personal spending and corporate
capital investment would continue to fuel growth.
   The Okasan think tank said domestic demand would push the
economy up 5.6 percent while external demand _ exports _ would
shrink and reduce the economy's growth by 1.1 percent.
   Okasan expected the trade surplus to drop from $93.3 billion in
the past fiscal year to $87.7 billion, and the dollar to average
124 yen.

<HEAD>Lucky Stores Rejects Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lucky Stores Inc. has spurned American
Stores Co.'s offer for a $1.74 billion buyout and says it may
undergo a major restructuring or sell the company elsewhere.
   Lucky said Thursday its directors unanimously had rejected
American Stores' unsolicited $45 a share tender offer as
``inadequate'' and not in the best interests of the company or its
stockholders.
   The board also rebuffed the offer by American Stores, a Salt
Lake City-based grocery and drugstore chain, to increase its bid to
$50 a share in a negotiated acquisition.
   In addition, Dublin-based Lucky adopted a stock purchase rights
defense plan aimed at making a hostile takeover prohibitively
expensive.
   The rejection of American Stores' surprise tender offer for
Lucky's 38.6 million outstanding shares came 17 months after Lucky
blocked a hostile takeover attempt by New York investor Asher
Edelman.
   A combination of the two companies would create the nation's
biggest supermarket chain.
   Mike Holt, American Stores vice president for investor public
relations, said his company had no comment on the announcement.
   Lucky's stock closed at $52.50 per share on the New York Stock
Exchange Thursday, up $3.75 from Wednesday's close.
   In addition to rejecting American Stores' bid, Lucky's board
also authorized company management and advisers to consider
alternatives to an American Stores buyout to boost its stock price.
   Alternatives could include a possible reorganization to focus on
Lucky's California operations, a leveraged recapitalization with
possible distributions to stockholders by a dividend or share
repurchase, and a negotiated sale of the company to a third party.
   ``We are confident that pursuit of one of these alternatives
will provide our best opportunity to achieve greater value for our
stockholders,'' stated John M. Lillie, Lucky's chairman and chief
executive officer.
   The board also adopted a warrant dividend plan and has declared
a dividend under the plan of one common stock purchase right for
each share of outstanding common stock, payable to stockholders of
record on April 8. The plan would act to dilute Lucky's common
stock in the event of a hostile takeover, making such a move
prohibitively expensive.
   The company stated the plan was aimed at preventing unsolicited
attempts to acquire a controlling stake in Lucky Stores through a
tender offer or on the open market ``at prices determined by the
board to be inadequate.''
   A merger of American Stores, with 1,700 outlets in 40 states,
and Lucky would have make Lucky the nation's largest supermarket
chain, surpassing No. 1 Kroger Co. Lucky has 480 outlets, 340
within the state.
   American Stores had indicated it would convert its struggling
240 Alpha Beta outlets in California to Lucky stores.
   American Stores last year posted $14.3 billion in annual sales,
while Lucky had $6.9 billion in sales.

<HEAD>Huge Supermarket Chain Reports Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safeway Stores Inc. says it suffered a
$487.7 million loss last year, largely due to interest expenses
from its 1986 leveraged buyout and to income tax law changes.
   The privately-held supermarket chain, the nation's
second-largest after Cincinnati-based Kroger Co., had posted a
$14.3 million loss in 1986. Safeway also said its revenue fell to
$18.3 billion last year from $20.3 billion the previous year.
   However, Safeway's operating profit rose to $448.3 million from
$422.9 million the previous year, Safeway said.
   Last year's loss was blamed on $576.4 million in interest
expense, largely stemming from the leveraged buyout, and a $409.4
million bookkeeping charge resulting from the new tax law, the
company said.
   Safeway believes its interest expenses have peaked and will
decline over the next few years, said the company's controller,
David Domeier.
   Domeier said the company trimmed its long-term debt by 32
percent to $3.1 billion in 1987 and is one to two years ahead of
schedule in paying off its debt.
   The drop in revenue was attributed to the sale of several
divisions, including the 105-store Liquor Barn chain and markets in
Britain and four states, to raise capital and help pay off the debt.
   During the same period, sales for U.S. stores grew 5 percent,
Domeier said.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower, Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar traded lower against all major
foreign currencies except the Swiss franc and Canadian dollar in
Europe early today. Gold prices rose.
   Foreign currency dealers said the market is waiting for a
meeting of finance ministers of the seven major industrialized
countries in Washington next week.
   Most said they expect the Group of Seven _ the United States,
Britain, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada _ to
reaffirm their wish to keep the dollar stable around its current
levels.
   European traders said interest was likely to focus on the
British pound again today, following intervention by the West
German and British central banks Thursday to stop sterling's rise.
   ``Sterling is very healthy at the moment but that old fear of
central bank intervention should keep the market from pushing it up
too fast,'' said one trader with a major Italian commercial bank.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.52 yen to a closing 125.18. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 125.35 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.6725 West German marks, down from 1.6810; 1.3825
Swiss francs, up from 1.3817; 5.6740 French francs, down from
5.7022; 1.8855 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8865; 1,241.20 Italian
lire, down from 1,246.50; and 1.2475 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2448.
   In London, it cost $1.8775 to buy one British pound today, more
expensive for buyers than late Thursday's $1.867.
   Gold prices were higher in London than late Thursday's $447.75 a
troy ounce. The gold metal opened at a bid price of $449.40 an
ounce but at midmorning today the city's five major bullion dealers
had fixed a recommended price of $448.60.
   One dealer said that after hitting a low of about $445 Thursday,
gold has found some support at its current levels. Other bullion
dealers said attention will be focused on the dollar, and that a
major move in the U.S. currency could send gold moving.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $448.65, up from $448 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.06 to close at a bid $450.72.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.42 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday's $6.40.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Fall Slightly In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices eased slightly today from their record
level of a day earlier, while the U.S. dollar also dipped in
trading against the Japanese yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 258.05-point winner Thursday, shed a modest
20.33 points, or 0.07 percent, finishing the week at 26,748.89.
   The Nikkei's close of 26,768.22 points Thursday was its highest
ever. Its level today, though marginally lower, surpassed the
previous best of 26,646.43 set the week before the worldwide stock
market panic last October.
   ``The decline was caused by price adjusting. There were concerns
that the market was rising too fast,'' said Hiromi Yoneyama of Wako
Securities.
   The weaker dollar also helped promote selling, he said.
   Activity faded in the afternoon after a busy morning session
during in prices rose on momentum carried over from Thursday's
sharp rally, traders said.
   The market's main barometer briefly touched a high of 26,926.41
during morning trading on an estimated volume of 1 billion shares _
twice the afternoon session's volume.
   Share prices were mixed as declining issues outpaced advancers
480 to 406, with 107 issues unchanged.
   Among the losers were electricals, precision machineries and
fishing industries. Constructions and foodstuffs also lost ground.
Popular issues included housing and real estate.
   The dollar closed at 125.18 yen, down 0.52 yen from its close of
125.70 Thursday. It opened the day at 125.52 yen and ranged between
125.05 and 125.78 yen.
   ``The dollar was sold in the afternoon on a New York Times
report that monetary authorities from seven major industrialized
nations will likely agree to maintain the dollar at the current
level when they meet next week in Washington,'' said an official of
a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said, however, a wait-and-see attitude was strong among
participants in advance of the next week's meeting and the
scheduled release in Washington of U.S. trade figures for February.

<HEAD>Report Offers Extensive Data On China Agriculture, Population</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China in recent years has been losing its
rural people, despite an overall growth in the country's
population, according to a new statistical report by the
Agriculture Department.
   In 1982, when China reported a population of more than 1.01
billion, a record 803.9 million, or 79 percent, lived in rural
areas. By 1985 the total population was more than 1.04 billion, but
rural residents were down to 662.9 million people, or 63 percent.
   Population figures and many others are included in a new edition
of ``Agricultural Statistics of the People's Republic of China,
1949-86,'' by Frederick W. Crook and others of the department's
Economic Research Service.
   The new version, which was distributed Thursday, expands greatly
an earlier statistical report on China's agriculture issued in
1984, which was the USDA's first since the communists took charge
in 1949.
   Although not likely to make this spring's best-seller lists, the
158-page report is expected to be in great demand from China
watchers and U.S. agricultural traders interested in that
potentially huge Asian market. The first edition in 1984 was 71
pages long.
   The report relies on ``the important, although still incomplete,
agricultural data that China's State Statistical Bureau reported
during 1949-85, with some updates through 1986,' the authors said.
   Some 126 national and provincial tables of figures are included,
along with an introduction, explanatory notes, references and
suggested readings.
   Various sections include agricultural production; ``inputs''
such as farm machinery, fertilizer and labor; exports and imports;
and consumption and procurement.
   The provincial tables include China's population by region and
province; agricultural areas by crops; hog slaughter; horse and
camel year-end inventory; milk production for cows and goats; and
consumption by peasants.
   Officials said the report may be ordered from: Superintendent of
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402,
or telephone (202) 783-3238.

   A fierce competition for the world's soybean
market has sprung up as demand increases for the high-protein,
oil-rich crop that once was dominated almost entirely by the United
States.
   Soybeans have the potential to supplement diets of low-income
people in the Third World, where it will be important to gain
consumer acceptance for soybeans and soy-fortified foods, Gary
Vocke, an Agriculture Department analyst, said Thursday in a new
report.
   ``A historical view shows that U.S. dominance of world soybean
trade, founded on U.S. research and development in the 1940s and
1950s, declined in the 1980s as South American countries, spurred
by high prices, developed large-scale production and processing
facilities,'' he said.
   Brazil and Argentina have been the main U.S. competitors in the
international soybean market.
   Vocke, an agriculture and trade analyst in the department's
Economic Research Service, added: ``Their success, mainly in
temperate areas, has not been duplicated in tropical areas
elsewhere in the Third World.''
   The major factors behind the increased demand for soybeans in
the Third World, he said, are rising incomes and population growth.
As families have more to spend, their demand increases for meat and
other food products such as margarine and cooking oil.
   `` Fierce export competition with the South Americans for these
markets, as well as the developed country market, will likely
continue,'' Vocke said. ``The expansion of large-scale soybean
production in South America will continue as long as soybean prices
are high enough for Brazilian farmers to profitably open new lands
for soybeans.''
   Further encouragement would be in the Brazilian government's
willingness to develop the rural transportation system connecting
the new lands to ocean ports, he said.
   ``If the price of soybeans is high relative to other crops,
farmers in Brazil, Argentina and elsewhere will find it profitable
to switch even more of their existing cropland to soybeans,'' Vocke
said.

   Foreigners continue to own just under 1
percent of U.S. agricultural land, slightly more than the level of
a year ago, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   The department's Economic Research Service said Thursday its
1987 year-end review of reports under the Agricultural Foreign
Investment Disclosure Act found 12.5 million acres of agricultural
land in foreign hands, 202,000 acres more than reported in 1986.
   Of the land owned by foreign interests, 50 percent was forest
land, 17 percent cropland, 28 percent pasture and other
agricultural land, and 5 percent used for non-agricultural purposes
or unreported.
   Corporations held 80 percent of the foreign-owned land, with the
balance held by individuals, partnerships, institutions and other
entities.
   As in the past, much of the ownership is concentrated in the
United Kingdom, Canada, West Germany, the Netherlands Antilles and
Switzerland. Those countries combined to account for 69 percent of
the foreign-held acreage, the agency said.
   Maine continued to have the heaviest concentration of foreign
ownership, with holdings of almost 1.79 million acres, mostly
timberland, or more than 14 percent of the total.
   ``Ninety-three percent of the foreign-owned acreage will remain
in agricultural production, according to foreign owners,'' the
report said.

<HEAD>London Shares Higher On Interest Rate Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices rose Friday when British commercial
banks heeded a Bank of England signal to cut their base lending
rate.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index rose 12.6
points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,773.6 at midday.
   Volume was light at 259.3 million shares at midday compared with
261.9 million shares at the same time Thursday.
   The commercial banks announced a cut in their base lending rate
by half a percentage point to 8 percent, the lowest level in more
than a decade.
   The banks cut the benchmark rate, effective Monday, after the
central bank reduced its own money market rate by 0.375 percnet to
8 percent, apparently to stem the British pound's advance.
   ``That's what we want, some more good news like that,'' said one
dealer, referring to the reduced interest rates. ``It should be
just the tonic the market needs'' to take it higher.
   The dealer said the market had been sluggish all morning, held
back in part by major new share issues by Tate and Lyle PLC to help
finance a tender offer for Staley Continental Inc. of the United
States and a huge issue announced by Barclays Bank PLC on Thursday.
   Other dealers were more wary of the benefits to equities from
the interest rate cuts, saying the lower rates revive fears of
inflationary pressures on Britain's economy.
   One dealer also noted that the pound failed to show marked
reaction shortly after the rate cut was announced, dampening the
positive sentiment in the equity market.

<HEAD>Tate and Lyle Launches Tender Offer For Staley</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tate and Lyle PLC, a major British sugar refiner
and distributor, announced today a $1.33 billion cash tender offer
for Staley Continental Inc., the second largest refiner of corn
sweeteners in the United States.
   Tate and Lyle, which already owns nearly 5 percent of Staley's
stock, said it was offering $32 a share for the rest of its 30.4
million outstanding shares.
   Staley stock closed at $30.12{ a share in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Wednesday.
   Staley has proposed that Tate and Lyle build on its stake
acquired in November and become a more substantial minority
shareholder, Tate and Lyle said. But Tate and Lyle said it decided
to launch the tender offer instead.
   The acquisition would give Tate and Lyle its first interest in
the U.S. corn sweetener market. Tate and Lyle said it would become
the only supplier of all three types of sugar _ corn, beet and cane
_ in the United States.
   ``We are confident that, as part of Tate and Lyle's North
American division, the performance and competitive position of
Staley's corn activities will be significantly enhanced,'' Tate and
Lyle Chairman Neil Shaw said.
   Tate and Lyle said it began legal action in the United States to
overturn takeover defenses established by Staley, including a
benefit package for its senior management.
   Tate and Lyle said the offer will be partly funded by the sale
of new shares to its existing shareholders, cash resources and a
bank loan.
   Tate and Lyle said it intends to sell Staley's food distribution
business, which Staley acquired in 1984 for $396 million, and that
it was prepared to consider any offers immediately.
   The acquisition and stock issue must be approved by Tate and
Lyle's shareholders, who are to meet on May 3.
   Staley's principal corn product is high fructose corn syrup,
known as HFCS. The largest refiner of corn sweeteners in the United
States is Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., also based in Decatur.

<TEXT>
   Texas American Bancshares Inc. and National
Bancshares Corp. officials have begun talks on a merger that they
say might require federal assistance.
   Fort Worth-based Texas American and San Antonio-based National
Bancshares issued separate statements Thursday, labeling the
discussions as ``very preliminary.''
   Bank officials would not say how much might be required from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   ``We are not at the FDIC with a gun at our heads,'' said Joseph
M. Grant, Texas American chairman.
   Grant said officials of the two banks, which began discussions
last fall, believe FDIC assistance is needed to attract capital
from investors.
   Richard W. Calvert, chairman of National Bancshares, declined to
say why his bank believes it needs FDIC assistance.
   If the two banks were combined, they would have $8 billion in
assets ith 64 subsidiary banks and branches. Grant estimated the
companies could save from combining duplicative support facilities.
   According to 1987 figures released by the banks, Texas American
Bancshares reported a net loss in income of $78 million last year,
with $5.17 billion in assets and about $3.99 billion in loans.
   National Bancshares Corp. of Texas reported a net loss of $64
million last year, with assets of about $2.8 billion and $1.8
billion in loans.
   The companies' negotiations for federal assistance ``come as no
real surprise,'' said Paul Sachtleben, a former deputy regional
director of the FDIC who now works as a consultant at Bracewell &
Patterson, an Austin-based law firm.
   ``Simply stated, you cannot raise capital today in Texas without
FDIC assistance,'' Grant said.
   In 1987, Republic Bank Corp. acquired InterFirst Corp., both of
Dallas, and the companies did not request federal assistance. The
combined First RepublicBank Corp. recently requested and received
$1 billion from the FDIC to stem a runoff in deposits.
   Dallas-based banking analyst Frank Anderson said the possible
merger and federally assisted recapitalization of Texas American
and National Bancshares ``puts the Texas banking industry that much
closer to putting its problems behind it.''
   Most of Texas American Bancshare's 25 subsidiary banks are
located in Central and North Texas, including three units in
Dallas. National Bancshares' 12 subsidiary banks are located in
Central and South Texas.

   KN Energy Inc. stockholders have denied
corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr. a seat on the company's board
of directors, the company announced.
   Pickens got support from about 15 percent of the estimated 9.3
million shares voted, Dick Buxton, a KN spokesman, said Thursday.
   Pickens' Amarillo-based Mesa Limited Partnership owns about 4.9
percent of KN's outstanding stock.
   In February, Pickens launched a proxy battle for one of four
available seats on the KN board, following an unsuccessful attempt
to buy the company last December for about $164 million.
   It was the third time KN has spurned an acquisition bid by
Pickens.
   ``We've known for a while that we were going to lose,'' said
Mesa spokesman David Batchelder after Thursday's announcement. But
he also would not rule out another purchase attempt.
   Elected to three-year terms on the KN board were David
Burkholder, Thos. Creigh Jr., Jordan L. Haines and William J. Hybl.

   The stock market headed higher today, continuing
its rally over the past three sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 81.57 points over
the last three trading days, rose 2.32 to 2,064.49 by 10 a.m. today
on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 553 up, 406 down and
476 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.81 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market has benefited lately from signs that the dollar has
steadied in foreign-exchange, reducing fears that the Federal
Reserve might soon tighten credit.
   In the credit markets today, prices of long-term government
bonds showed some moderate gains, putting their yields in the 8.75
percent range.
   Brokers also say investors are looking for generally strong
corporate earnings reports for the first quarter over the next few
weeks.
   With all that, however, many analysts remain skeptical about the
market's chances to launch a sustained rally toward last year's
highs.
   General Electric, which reported higher first-quarter earnings
on Thursday, rose { to 41} in active trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .25 to 150.53. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .02 at 299.36.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.50 to
2,062.17.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 975 up, 535 down and 480 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 177.84 million shares, against 181.76 million in the
previous session.

<TEXT>
   Britain's major commercial banks, heeding a signal
from the Bank of England, announced Friday a cut in their base
lending rate by half a percentage point to 8 percent, the lowest
level in more than a decade.
   Midland Bank PLC, National Westminster Bank PLC, Barclays Bank
PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC cut the benchmark rate, effective Monday,
after the central bank reduced its own money market rate by 0.375
percent to 8 percent, apparently to stem the British pound's
advance.
   The base rate cut brought the rate to its lowest level since it
stood at 7.5 percent in April, 1978, the banks said.
   The banks last cut the rate, by half a point, on March 17.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has been concerned
about the strength of the pound against the West German mark since
early March. The pound has been buoyed by Britain's relatively high
interest rates, which make pound-denominated investments more
attractive, stimulating demand for the currency.
   A stronger pound could hurt Britain's exports and corporate
profits.
   However, there have been concerns that rate cuts would spur
inflation, which is running at a modest 3.3 percent.
   Mrs. Thatcher repeatedly has said that reining in inflation is
her top economic priority.
   Better commercial borrowers generally obtain loans at 1
percentage point above the base rate.

<HEAD>Bargainers OK'd To Go For Ford-GM Pattern, Some Kenosha Workers
Admitted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers bargainers have
received their marching orders: win for Chrysler Corp. employees
the same pay, benefits and job protections enjoyed by their
counterparts at the top two automakers.
   The UAW's Chrysler council wrapped up a two-day strategy session
here Thursday and voted to seek a return to labor parity between
the No. 3 automaker and its larger rivals, General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co.
   Since 1979, the union's Chrysler contract has expired at
different times than the Ford and GM pacts because the Chrysler
contract was reopened several times for company-saving concessions.
   But the UAW will insist on a two-year contract with Chrysler so
all three pacts will expire together in 1990, adding to workers'
bargaining power at a time when they will need it most because of
the growing number of Japanese-owned factories building cars in the
United States.
   ``There might be a wiggle here or there that will be different
but the principles will be the same,'' UAW Vice President Marc
Stepp said. ``We are ready to do battle for justice, economically
and socially, with the Chrysler Corporation.''
   Chrysler's UAW contract expires Sept. 14. Talks normally would
begin in mid-July but the UAW and Chrysler agreed to start early
after Chrysler's attempt to sell its Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary
ignited angry UAW opposition and left behind a bitter residue.
   The bargaining is set to begin April 18 in Detroit.
   ``We will take the pattern agreement and as closely as possible
fits those provisions (to) the Chrysler agreement,'' Stepp said.
   The Chrysler council represents 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off
workers, members of 49 UAW locals.
   The council also voted nearly unanimously to accept some former
American Motors Corp. workers into their fold under a compromise
that ended days of potentially divisive debate.
   Chrysler bought AMC last August and announced last fall it will
close a 5,500-worker assembly plant in Kenosha, Wis., leaving 1,000
workers at a Kenosha engine plant and a Milwaukee parts
distribution center to either bargain with Chrysler on their own or
come under the national contract.
   The soon-to-be-laid-off assembly plant workers will be covered
under a separate plant closing agreement and will not join the
union's Chrysler council.
   Local leaders who did not want to admit the 1,000 Kenosha
workers said they feared the former AMC workers, whose seniority
averages 18-20 years, would take jobs that otherwise might go to
laid-off Chrysler workers.
   Under the compromise, the Kenosha workers, unlike other Chrysler
workers, will not be able to take their seniority with them if
their plant closes or use their seniority to take openings in other
plants ahead of workers already on layoff.
   ``We weren't looking for that anyway. We were looking to be
covered under the same wages, hours and working conditions that all
other Chrysler workers get,'' said Rudy Kuzel, chairman of Local 72
at Kenosha.
   ``We know that Chrysler wants to close four plants in the
Detroit area and it would be presumptuous of us to expect to move
into other plants with our seniority,'' Kuzel said.
   Local 72 President Ed Steagall called the approval a miracle
because of heated behind-the-scenes wrangling over the issue since
before delegates began arriving Tuesday.
   The union's elected 10-member rank-and-file bargaining committee
will have to negotiate both the demands package and the inclusion
of the Kenosha workers with Chrysler in the talks.
   Last fall, the UAW won contracts with Ford and GM that forbade
layoffs for any reason except slow sales, banned plant closings not
announced before negotiations and limited the top two automakers'
ability to shift work to outside suppliers or to their own plants
in other countries, including Canada and Mexico.

<HEAD>Saudi Monarch Calls for Cooperation by All Oil Producers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Fahd has called for
``solidarity'' among members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to bolster the target price of $18 a barrel,
the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
   ``If this is achieved, then there will be immense benefits and
the prices of oil will always be on the increase,'' he told college
students Thursday night while on inspection tour of the al-Qasseem
region some 200 miles north of here.
   The Saudi monarch attributed the instability of oil prices to
attempts by ``some'' to sell at discount prices, and expressed hope
that adherence will be strict to production and price rulings laid
down by the 13-nation OPEC.
   He affirmed that the kingdom ``has never at any time violated
any agreement related to oil,'' thus adding yet another official
denial to ongoing reports that Saudi Arabia was also violating OPEC
prices and selling at a discount because of the weak market.
   Fahd did not name any of the member states of the OPEC cartel
that he accused of cheating on the rulings laid by OPEC for more
than a year and designed to strengthen oil prices around an 18
dollars for benchmark crude.
   At Saudi Arabia's request, the five-member OPEC pricing
committee is meeting in Vienna on Saturday to consider ways and
means of firming up the world market's flagging prices.
   Fahd's call for ``solidarity'' among OPEC member states was
apparently aimed at pre-empting outbursts of inter-OPEC criticism
to help the Vienna gathering formulate the proper recommendations.
   On Thursday, Iranian oil minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh accused
Saudi Arabia of trying to destabilize the oil market by not
agreeing to have the Vienna meeting held at an earlier date.
   He said that Saudi Arabia blocked a call three months ago by
Iran to have the pricing committee convene. Committee members are
oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, Nigeria and
Algeria.
   Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer will be in Vienna after calling
on two major non-OPEC oil producers _ Mexico and Britain _ seeking
their cooperation in helping stabilize the market by restraining
their output.
   Saudi Arabia is the leading member of the cartel and alone
possesses at least one-fifth of the world's proven oil reserves.
Fahd stressed this point in his address saying that the kingdom
``now is one of the major countries with reserves in the ground
that can suffice it for 200 years according to the estimates of
world experts.''

<HEAD>Former Broker Gets Jail For $1 Million Defrauding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former trader who pleaded guilty to commodities
fraud in the $1 million-plus defrauding of his employer has been
sentenced to three years in prison.
   U.S. District Judge James Alesia ordered Jeffrey Donnelly on
Thursday to surrender June 1 to begin serving the sentence.
   Donnelly is a former trader for CRT Services Inc., a member firm
of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. He pleaded guilty to two counts
of commodities fraud on Feb. 17.
   According to a plea agreement, Donnelly admitted defrauding CRT
of more than $1 million by diverting money from profitable trade in
Standard & Poor's stock index futures to four accounts from January
1984 through July 1986.
   The diversion was carried out through a scheme involving secret
and illegal agreements with four CRT customers, the plea agreement
said. Donnelly received 35 percent of the profits, while the four
customers got the remaining 65 percent, according to the agreement.
   Donnelly was among 10 brokers, traders and others who worked at
the Chicago Board of Trade and the Merc, and were charged with
wrongdoing in indictments and criminal complaints filed by U.S.
Attorney Anton Valukas in January.
   Donnelly was the first to be sentenced.

   Mexico and Saudi Arabia have agreed to create
a bilateral consultative mechanism to seek price stability on the
world petroleum market.
   The new mechanism was established ``to strive for the stability
of the international petroleum market and the improvement of
hydrocarbon prices,'' according to a statement released Thursday,
following a meeting between Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer and
President Miguel de la Madrid.
   Department of Energy, Mines and Parastatal Industries Secretary
Fernando Hiriart also attended the talks.
   Nazer observed during the meeting that both oil-producing
countries ``probably will remain in the world hydrocarbons market
long after other exporting countries leave,'' according to the
agency statement.
   Mexico is not a member of the Organization of Oil Exporting
Countries but closely monitors its price and production guidelines.
It was the world's fourth largest oil producer in 1985 but since
has slipped to sixth place after the Soviet Union, the United
States, Saudi Arabia, Iran and China.
   Hiriart and Nazer agreed ``that the stability of the
international petroleum market and improvemnt of hydrocarbon prices
only can be brought about with the cooperation of all producing
countries, members and non-members of OPEC,'' the statement said.
   Energy officials of both governments will meet periodically to
evaluate the market situation, the statement added.
   On Monday, Mexico's state oil monopoly Pemex announced that it
had lowered the price of its light Isthmus crude by $1.62 a barrel
to Japanese customers in March.
   Pemex revealed in a statement that the price of its light oil
was $13.86 a barrel in March, down from $15.48 a barrel in February.
   The price for its heavy Maya crude fell from $12.83 to $11.20,
the monopoly.
   Japan buys 180,000 barrels a day of crude, accounting for 11
percent of Mexico's total exports in March.

   General Motors Corp., which helped persuade the
government to reduce its car fuel economy regulations for each of
the last three model years, has again called for the repeal or
reduction of the rules.
   The No. 1 automaker said in a statement Thursday the Corporate
Average Fuel Economy Standards are ``a disadvantage for full-line
manufacturers'' that should be repealed or amended.
   Without some action, GM said it could be ``subject to civil
penalties in the hundreds of millions of dollars'' and may be
forced to ``close plants or severely restrict product offerings to
remain in compliance.''
   GM and other automakers were successful in efforts to win
reduced CAFE standars in 1986, 1987 and 1988. The government had
set a fleetwide goal of 27.5 miles per gallon for 1988 models, but
agreed to lower it to 26 mpg.
   GM anticipates compliance with the reduced level in 1988, but
the standard is scheduled to return to 27.5 mpg in 1989 model year.
   The company has said it might fail to meet CAFE regulations in
1989 if gasoline prices remain stable or continue falling. Stable
gas prices have made the less fuel-efficient six- and
eight-cylinder cars more attractive to consumers.
   Companies are allowed to borrow credits from past and future
years in which they have exceeded or expect to exceed the standard
as a way to reduce current non-compliance.
   GM is asking the government to reduce retroactively the 1985
model year standard to 26 mpg from 27.5 mpg, which would give the
company credit to offset any 1989 shortfalls. Other auto companies
are doing the same.

   Specialist firms that control the rights to
trade specific issues on the New York Stock Exchange will have to
meet tough new capital requirements under the Big Board's latest
post-crash proposal.
   The capital plan, approved Thursday by the NYSE board, is the
latest in a series of steps taken to strengthen the market in the
wake of Wall Street's October crash.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission now must consider the
plan.
   Perrin Long, who follows the securities industry industry for
Lipper Analytical Securities Corp., said the new proposal appears
mainly designed to bolster confidence in the marketplace. He said
it may help keep trading orderly, but would not prevent another
severe decline.
   Richard Torrenzano, a spokesman for the NYSE, confirmed that
``the vast majority of the specialists can meet'' the proposed new
requirements today.
   Long said the new requirements could lead to more consolidation
among specialists.
   The exchange currently has 54 specialist firms, which control
the rights to market the stocks of the 1,650-plus companies listed
on the exchange. Specialists are required to keep order in the
market by setting opening prices and covering trades when there are
not enough buyers or sellers.
   The specialist system came under scrutiny in the days following
the Oct. 19 crash because of reports that some specialists failed
to fulfill their roles during the market turmoil. Some specialist
firms merged with bigger firms or had to give up their roles
because of shattering financial damage suffered in the crash.
   Since the crash, five stock specialists have agreed voluntarily
to give up their roles as market makers on the exchange.
   Under the proposed changes, a specialist firm must show it can
meet, with its own liquid assets, a minimum capital requirement of
$1 million or be able to buy 15,000 shares of each common stock in
which it makes a market, whichever is greater.
   The rules currently require minimum capital of $100,000 or the
ability to buy 5,000 shares in each stock in which the specialist
makes a market.
   John J. Phelan Jr., chairman and chief executive of the
exchange, said one question asked repeatedly since the crash has
been, ``Would the condition of the market during the week of Oct.
19 have been better than it was if specialists had more capital?''
   ``The simple answer was `no,' and the Brady Commission agreed
with that conclusion,'' Phelan said, referring to the presidential
commission that investigated the causes of the crash.
   But Phelan said the crash and subsequent volatility of the stock
market served to ``underscore the need for strengthening the
specialist system'' and he said the proposed changes were ``an
appropriate interim step to be taken now to bolster confidence'' in
it.
   He said other measures concerning the adequacy of the
specialists' capital requirements are under review.
   Among other post-crash steps the exchange has announced
previously was a curb on computerized program trading, which takes
effect when the Dow Jones industrial average moves 50 points in
either direction from the previous day's close in one session.
   That curb was activated for the first time on Wednesday when the
Dow's rise surpassed 50 points in the last hour of trading. The Dow
finished with a gain of 64.16 points for the day.
   The exchange has also announced it has begun taking steps to
improve its ability to handle heavy trading volumes.

   Consumer prices rose 5.1 percent during
March, the lowest monthly figure since November 1985, the central
Bank of Mexico announced.
   It said late Thursday that inflation recorded for the first
three months of the year reached 31.5 percent, compared to 23.6
percent in the same period of 1987.
   Inflation last year soared to a record 159.2 percent annual
figure. The government put into effect controls on wages and prices
for goods and services it regulates in March, the second phase of a
so-called Economic Solidarity Pact intended to brake hyperinflation
and reduce it to 1 to 2 percent monthly by the end of the year.
   Under the program, the value of the peso _ 2,280 to the dollar _
and the minimum daily wage of 8,000 pesos, or about $3.50, will
remain steady through the end of May.

<HEAD>Blanchard Relays Message from GM: No More Layoffs in Michigan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLINT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. James J. Blanchard said General Motors
Corp. has promised no more layoffs in Michigan in the foreseeable
future, and he said the company may rehire some laid off employees.
   ``Based on my conversations with (GM President) Bob Stempel, ...
it is safe to say that in the foreseeable future, not only will
there not be any more layoffs _ and we can't afford any more _
there may be some rehiring,'' Blanchard said Thursday night at a
news conference.
   Blanchard repeated the statements during an appearance later in
Flint, adding he has been told by GM officials that Buick City soon
will call back some workers.
   Jim Crellin, a spokesman for GM, could not immediately confirm
Stempel's statement to Blanchard.
   Department of Commerce Director Doug Ross said Blanchard's
comments arose from a conversation he had Thursday with Stempel.
   Ross said Stempel gave Blanchard the assurance after the
governor said he planned to say during the Flint appearance that
Michigan could not afford any more GM layoffs.
   Ross said Stempel responded: ``We are not, at this point, we are
not looking to shut down any more plants or lay off any more here
in Michigan.''
   Eric B. Mays, chairman of the UAW Region 1C unemployment
coalition, which he said represents about 10,000 laid-off GM
workers, was skeptical.
   ``I'll make a prediction that there will be more layoffs _ and
let's see who's right, me or the governor and Stempel.''

   Bonds posted moderate price gains while interest
rates retreated in early trading today.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue, which on Thursday lost
about \ point, or $2.50 per $1,000 face amount, rose about $5 by
midday. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 8.73
percent from 8.77 percent.
   William Brachfeld, executive vice president in charge of fixed
income at Daiwa Securities Inc., attributed the rebound largely to
technical factors stemming from the dollar.
   Investors who had been betting on a decline in the credit
markets bought bonds to cover their short positions prior to next
week's meeting among the seven biggest industrial nations, known as
the Group of Seven, he said.
   Analysts speculate that the G-7 will push for currency
stabilization, thereby strengthening the dollar and pushing bond
prices up.
   The dollar is closely watched by the credit markets as a sign of
where inflation might be headed. A rising dollar lessens the
prospect of import-led inflation and makes dollar-denominated bonds
and notes more attractive to foreigners.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose about \ point, intermediate maturities were 3-16
point to 9-32 point higher and long-term issues were up about ]
point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a

   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years

   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were down 2 basis points to

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fired Merrill Lynch broker accused of fatally
shooting his former boss, who was chased from his office and
pistol-whipped in front of about 60 company workers, was ordered
held on $500,000 bail today.
   Lonnie Gilchrist, 41, of Boston, did not offer a plea at his
arraignment in Boston Municipal Court. Judge Peter Donovan ordered
his case continued until April 19, said court clerk Russell Long.
   Gilchrist had complained of racial discrimination, but was fired
because of ``poor performance,'' a newspaper quoted sources as
saying.
   George Cook, 56, a senior vice president and 31-year Merrill
Lynch employee, was meeting with Gilchrist when he was shot
Thursday, said Patrick Murphy, national director of security for
Merrill Lynch
   Cook then fled into the main office and Gilchrist chased him for
about 30 feet, beating him on the head with the .22 caliber pistol
until Cook collapsed, witnesses said. At that point, Murphy said,
``Mr. Gilchrist pumped more shots into him while he was on the
floor.''
   Cook was hit in the chest, back, arm and side with four of a
total of nine bullets fired, Murphy said.
   After Cook collapsed in the 36th-floor downtown office, three
workers wrestled Gilchrist to the floor.
   ``I don't know what went on between them,'' said Merrill Lynch
vice president Paul Knouse of the meeting between Cook and
Gilchrist. ``George wasn't able to say much. I think he was already
in shock ... ''
   Gilchrist, a graduate of the University of Massachusetts in
Boston and the Wharton School of Business at the University of
Pennsylvania, had worked for the company for less than two years
and was fired Wednesday for inefficient performance.
   Merrill Lynch spokesman Fred Yager declined to be more specific
about the reasons behind the firing. He said he did not know
whether Gilchrist's meeting with Cook had been scheduled.
   An unnamed associate was quoted by The Boston Globe as saying
Gilchrist went through eight jobs in 11 years before joining
Merrill Lynch in June 1986. He was told repeatedly that he would
have to ``start performing'' there or lose his job, the associate
said.
   ``Lonnie was doing very poorly,'' said an unidentified friend
who told the Globe he talked to Gilchrist by telephone Wednesday
night, and that Gilchrist gave no indication that he had been
fired. ``He was bright but he couldn't communicate or sell. He
couldn't bring in the revenue but George Cook was trying to help
him along.''
   The newspaper said Gilchrist made only $17,051 in commissions in
his first year, less than 20 percent of the average $100,000 in
commissions a first-year broker makes, according to a Merrill Lynch
official in New York. Since October, Gilchrist had received $6,491
in commissions, the newspaper said.
   The Globe quoted unnamed sources as saying Gilchrist was heard
to complain that his bosses' growing criticism of his weak sales
volume at Merrill Lynch was racially motivated. ``Lonnie was taking
this as racial, but it was just poor performance,'' one source said.
   Gilchrist, who lived with his mother, filed a racial
discrimination complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against
Discrimination three years ago, claiming Northrop Corp. of Norwood
refused to give him a job because he was black. Northrop said it
didn't hire Gilchrist because he asked for too much money. The
commission dismissed the complaint on grounds of insufficient
evidence.
   A Merrill Lynch office manager in Florida was killed and another
broker wounded after last October's stock market plunge by a
customer who had been told he owed $138,000. The investor, who then
killed himself, had seen his stock holdings drop $2.5 million in
value after the Oct. 19 market collapse.

<HEAD>EEC Questions Japan-U.S. Public Works Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community
Commission Friday asked Japan to clarify the terms of an accord
with the United States opening Japanese public works projects to
U.S. firms.
   ``If it turned out that this agreement would be yet another
bilateral deal between these two countries to the exclusion of
others, that would be very damaging,'' EEC External Relations
Commissioner Willy De Clercq said Friday.
   The EEC has criticized past efforts by the United States to open
Japanese markets through preferential bilateral accords.
   Last month the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said parts
of a U.S.-Japanese accord on trade in semiconductors violated its
international rules of commerce.
   The public works deal was signed Tuesday in Washington.
   ``We take this affair very seriously, not only because of the
amount of potential trade involved but also because we feel that
bilateral deals are hurting the spirit of free trade,'' De Clercq
said in a statement.
   He said he would raise the issue at a meeting in Vancouver next
week of trade officials from the United States, Japan, Canada and
the EEC.
   The public works accord signed by U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter and Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ichiro
Ozawa, was termed a declaration of intent rather than a formal
bilateral agreement.
   U.S. officials said it was intended to provide market access to
Japan for U.S. engineering and construction firms and for U.S.
suppliers of a wide range of equipment for projects financed
directly or indirectly with Japanese government funds.
   De Clercq said he has not yet seen the text of the accord but
sought ``an immediate, official declaration by the Japanese
government clarifying the situation.''
   ``There is a need for a binding commitment sufficiently specific
to reassure the (EEC) and its industry that the latter will be able
to bid for work under these major projects on an equal and
non-discriminatory basis with regard to both Japanese and third
country competitors,'' he said.

   Less than six months after the global market
collapse, Japanese stock prices have surged above pre-crash levels,
thanks to market resilience and renewed confidence in the country's
healthy economy.
   ``People have realized the Tokyo market has certain strengths,''
said Simon Smithson at the Kleinwort Benson investment firm.
   The main index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world's largest
in terms of money invested, fell 15 percent last October in the
session after the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell a
record 508 points, or 23 percent.
   On Thursday, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
finished making up all its lost ground as it surpassed its
pre-crash level and reached its highest level in history, 26,769.22.
   On Friday, the Nikkei index slipped less than 0.1 percent,
losing 20.33 points to close at 26,748.89.
   The Dow Jones index, meanwhile, still languishes more than 8
percent below its level of the day before the crash and 24 percent
below its peak of last August. Other world stock exchanges are also
below pre-crash levels.
   Julian Jones of the Vickers da Costa investment firm said the
Tokyo market had been pushed by factors ``intrinsic and unique to
Japan'' which had more to do with underlying domestic economic
factors that could not be applied internationally.
   ``They were Japanese reasons,'' he said.
   Some of them are low interest rates, high corporate profits,
strong economic growth estimated at a 7 percent annual rate in the
last quarter of 1987 and inflation so low that consumer prices in
February were 0.7 percent below a year earlier.
   Also, investors are reassured by controls on price movements of
stocks, which they believe protect the market against a crash,
Smithson said.
   Still, some Japanese officials worry that the Tokyo Stock
Exchange is bouncing back too fast. Satoshi Sumita, governor of the
Bank of Japan, said Thursday that stock prices have risen too
rapidly in relation to economic growth.
   Many investment strategists remain optimistic. Hisamichi Sawa,
chief strategist at the Prudential Bache investment firm, said the
Tokyo stock market is sensitive to corporate earnings, and the
Nikkei's rise was powered by substantial improvements in company
profits.
   ``The domestic sector is now growing by more than 6 percent,''
Sawa said. Other analysts agree, and say the economy's overall
growth _ compensating for a decline in exports _ will be 4 to 4.5
percent this year.
   Sawa attributed the market's resilience to a ``substantial level
of liquidity and low interest rates.'' The prime lending rate in
Japan is 5.5 percent.
   ``Investor sentiment is very optimistic,'' Sawa said. ``Money is
flowing into the market from bond investments and savings
accounts.''
   Traders also agreed that a stable foreign exchange rate is
contributing strongly to the Nikkei's continuing bullish
performance. The U.S. dollar fluctuated mainly in a narrow range of
125 to 128 yen last month.
   ``People realized the dollar was not headed for 120 yen as
quickly as they originally thought,'' said Clap Ham, director of
research at Jardine Fleming.
   ``Removal of this fear has pushed the market up,'' he added.
   Many analysts said the country's system of government control
over daily market movements also played a substantial role in
fueling the rise.
   ``There is no doubt about it,'' said Ham. Investors are bound to
feel comfortable with ``a market secured in government
intervention.''
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange determines daily price-change limits
for stocks from their previous day's closing level. At the bottom
end, shares closing at less than 100 yen (79 cents) are allowed to
move a maximum of 30 yen (24 cents) up or down, while at the top,
those closing above 10,000 yen ($79), are given a maximum
fluctuation of 2,000 yen ($16).
   Trading offers outside the stock's allowed range are not
accepted, meaning shares with quick price changes sometimes are not
traded for much of a session.
   Traders say the restrictions greatly inhibited the flow of money
out of the market at the time of the crash, thereby limiting the
overall decline.
   ``The limits had a positive calming influence on the stock
market,'' said Smithson of Kleinwort Benson. The ``close
relationship between the administration and institutions'' had an
``important role and slowed the rate of fall.''
   Jardine Fleming's Ham described the government as ``a guardian
angel'' who will do whatever is needed to keep the market from
falling.
   He added that numerous American investors have recently come
into the Tokyo market, lured by the perceived benefits of the
Japanese system.
   But while some analysts are predicting the Nikkei index will
continue up _possibly nearing the 30,000 mark by the end of summer
_ they stopped short of saying Tokyo, already the world's largest
market in terms of total value of shares, will replace New York and
London in dictating future market trends.
   Sawa said the U.S. stock market will continue to wield a strong
influence over Tokyo activity. ``Assuming New York does not drop
significantly or remains at its present level, the Tokyo market
will move up,'' he said.
   He predicted prices will be bolstered by a new buying mood among
the ``many financial institutions, including insurance firms and
trust banks, who missed the bus because the market went up''
quicker than they expected.

<HEAD>One Millionth Car Rolls Off Assembly Line; Hondas Arrive in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARYSVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honda celebrated two milestones Friday
when its one millionth U.S.-produced car rolled off the assembly
line and its first exported cars rolled onto a dock in Japan.
   A Civic four-door sedan was driven off the assembly line at
Honda of America Manufacturing's auto plant in his central Ohio
city, becoming the one millionth American-made car since Honda
started building cars in the United States in November 1982.
   Halfway around the world, a shipload of 540 Honda Accords built
at the Marysville plant arrived in Tokyo, ending a monthlong
journey that started on March 7 from Portland, Ore.
   The one millionth car was driven by Al Kinzer, who became Honda
of America's first employee when he was hired as manager of
administration in 1978. Honda calls its employees associates.
   ``We owe our ability to produce 1 million cars in such a short
period of time to the teamwork and efforts of our associates,''
said Kinzer, now vice president and plant manager of Honda's engine
plant in Anna in western Ohio. ``They have proven that Honda
quality knows no geographical boundaries.''
   The arrival of the Honda Accords signaled an end to a voyage
that was interrupted when the ship's ballast tank and fuel tank
cracked during a storm in the northern Pacific Ocean on the third
day at sea. It returned to Portland and left again on March 17.
   In Tokyo, Honda spokesman Bret Anderson said the company does
not have facilities in Japan to build the American-made coupe.
   ``It was built for the U.S. market. We see the car as an
American car,'' he said.
   Honda is the nation's fourth-largest car company in sales and
manufacturing. It began manufacturing in the United States in
September 1979 with production at its motorcycle plant in
Marysville.
   Production at the Marysville auto plant began Nov. 1, 1982, with
the Accord four-door sedan. The Civic four-door sedan was added to
production on July 24, 1986.
   Production of the engine for the Civic began at Anna on Sept.
23, 1986.
   The company in February began construction for a new assembly
plant near its Marysville operation. The new plant, called the East
Liberty Auto Plant, is scheduled to begin production of Civic
four-door sedans in August 1989.

   Louisiana-Pacific Corp. has received $440
million from the federal government as final payment for 26,544
acres of timberland taken in the 1978 expansion of California's
Redwood National Park.
   With previous payments, the wood-products manufacturer has
received $665 million in principal and interest for the timberland.
   ``After 10 years of discussion and court debate, it's a pleasure
to finally have these funds in the bank so we can put the money to
use on behalf of our employees and stockholders,'' said Harry A.
Merlo, L-P president and chairman on Friday.
   About $100 million of the settlement will be used to pay back
taxes on the land, and $170 million will repay long-term debts that
carried provisions for repayment after a settlement was received.
   Portions of the remaining money will be used to repay other
debts and to fund several capital projects, such as the Inner-Seal
panel plant under construction near Athens, Ga., and the $70
million upgrading of the company's pulp mill in Samoa, Calif.
   L-P has 128 plants and mills throughout the United States.

   Newsweek magazine has decided to end its special
editions, Newsweek on Campus and Newsweek on Health, both of which
have been losing money.
   The decision was disclosed to the magazines' staffs on Thursday,
said Diana Pearson, communications director of Newsweek, a
subsidiary of Washington Post Co. No editorial staffers will lose
their jobs but six advertising salespeople for the publications
will be let go, she said.
   The publications' revenue came solely from advertising.
   Newsweek on Health, a quarterly that prints 500,000 copies and
mails them to doctors' and dentists' offices, will bow out after
the spring issue.
   Newsweek on Campus will have two more editions, in May and
September. Its 1.3 million copies are inserted into school
newspapers at more than 200 colleges and universities and also are
mailed to students who subscribe to Newsweek.
   To cope with a 20 percent rise in printing and postage costs,
Newsweek also will raise its basic subscription rate by about 10
percent. The weekly's circulation is 94 percent by subscription and
6 percent at the $2 cover price at newsstands.
   Newsweek's current circulation is a record 3,198,000, Pearson
said.

   The stock market posted some spotty gains today,
struggling to extend its rally of the past three sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 81.57 points over

<HEAD>Testing Firm Wins 14-Year Battle With Federal Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Baltimore-based electrical testing company
has won a 14-year battle with the U.S. Occupational Safety and
Health Administration and broken two other companies' hold on the
U.S. market for product testing.
   MET Laboratories Inc. tried for more than a decade to get the
federal agency to set standards for the national accreditation of
product testing firms, and change a regulation that specifically
listed two laboratories and thus kept others out.
   After settling two lawsuits brought in federal district court by
MET, OSHA on Tuesday will publish standards for accreditation in
the Federal Register .
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' said Leonard Frier, MET's
founder and president.
   The existing, and soon to be defunct, regulation says that
testing shall be done by a nationally-recognized company, such as
Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. and Factory Mutual Engineering Corp.
   Frier said that for many years Underwriters Laboratories, Inc.
has had a virtual monopoly on the sort of electrical testing his
company does. That firm, established by the insurance industry in
1890, was not a party to any of the legal actions.
   ``The only thing they're guilty of,'' Frier said, ``is running a
great public relations effort.''
   Frier's objections in correspondence and the lawsuits has been
to the specific reference to UL, which tests more than 12,500
products, including consumer electrical appliances, and Boston-area
FM, which primarily tests fire safety products.
   He said OSHA's regulation kept companies like his from
certifying the safety of products that OSHA itself will recognize
as proper for the workplace, said Frier.
   UL, which has headquarters in North Brook, Ill., and additional
laboratories in New York, California and North Carolina, had no
comment Thursday on OSHA's setting a time for the publication of
new standards.
   Founded by insurance companies, UL now is an independent,
not-for-profit corporation.
   Norwood, Mass.-based FM also had no comment Friday.
   The Baltimore businessman first requested that OSHA set
standards for accrediting testing firms in March 1974. His firm,
which depends on field testing rather than new-product testing for
its revenues, was growing and for several years he did not press
the matter with OSHA.
   Then in May 1982 Frier brought suit against the Secretary of
Labor, who has ultimate responsibility for OSHA. Before the suit
came to trial, OSHA settled the legal action by agreeing to
re-write an existing reference to accreditation by March 1984.
   Although OSHA agreed that it would change its regulation, it did
not and last June MET went back to federal court, charging that
OSHA had breached the settlement. In December, a federal judge
directed OSHA to comply with the settlement and set a time limit
for publication of standards.
   Joseph E. Pipkin, the Towson resident who heads OSHA's office of
electrical and electronics safety standards, said Thursday that
part of the long delay was due to ``the number of reviews that are
necessary for something like this.''
   He said there was agreement at OSHA ``several years ago'' that
its regulation ``kept other companies out, but for various reasons
the changes just never moved forward.''
   MET also has a branch in Burlington, N.J., in suburban
Philadelphia. It has 125 employees and annual revenues of about
$3.5 million.

<HEAD>$80 Million Grocery Leaves Couple Overdrawn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No matter how many prime ribs or steaks
Carol Armstrong placed in her shopping cart, her husband knew the
grocery trip did not cost what his bank account indicated _ $80
million.
   ``I was a little surprised. I knew it was a mistake,'' said
Richard Armstrong, 41, on Friday.
   An innocent shopping trip March 23 to a local supermarket cost
$121.78, but a bank error added another $80 million to the
purchase, making it perhaps the most expensive grocery trip in
history.
   Mrs. Armstrong had paid for the groceries with an automated
teller card from Wells Fargo Bank.
   Armstrong, an electronics technician for the Bay Area Rapid
Transit District, said he realized something was wrong several days
later when he couldn't withdraw money from their account.
   He tried unsuccessfully several times to withdraw money. Then,
somewhat perplexed, he called up his balance.
   ``This huge number with a minus sign comes spilling out,''
Armstrong said. Since the automated teller only goes up to $1
million, the machine showed his account overdrawn for that amount.
   Despite this shock, Armstrong wanted to purchase some flags and
went to a flag store. ``I said `I think I'm a million dollars
short, so can I write a check?''' Since the owner knew him,
Armstrong was allowed to write a check.
   He then called his bank's 24-hour hotline to notify them of the
mistake. The bank, he said, insisted the Armstrongs had mistakenly
written a check for $80 million. He noted, however, that
$80,000,121.78 had been deducted from their account.
   Armstrong finally deduced that the bank's mistake stemmed from
the $121.78 check for the grocery trip. Still, Armstrong was left
without money last weekend.
   ``I was penniless. I had to rob my kid's piggy banks,'' he said.
   Wells Fargo corrected the Armstrongs' bank balance on Tuesday. A
bank spokeswoman said it was a clerical error.
   Armstrong said that even though he realized it was a mistake, it
was hard to be without money on Easter weekend for his family,
including his two children.
   ``It's pretty tough to convice people, `Hey I'm $80 million
dollars short, can you lend me a hundred dollars,''' he said.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Reports 20 Percent Drop In Passenger Miles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines announced that the number of
paying passenger miles it flew in March and its passenger volume
dropped 20 percent from the same month a year earlier.
   Eastern said Friday that it flew 2.82 billion revenue passenger
miles in March, down from 3.53 billion in March 1987.
   A revenue passenger mile, or RPM, represents one paying
passenger flown one mile and is used to determine an airline's
capacity.
   Passenger volume for March also fell 20 percent, to 3.51 million
passengers from 4.39 million a year earlier, Eastern reported.
   ``The figures are very misleading,'' said Eastern spokeswoman
Paula Musto. ``Last year our passenger volume was artificially high
because we were in the midst of our MaxSaver (deep disount) fares.
We had fares as low as $79 to New York City (from Miami) _ that
really increased our discretionary travelers.''
   She also said Eastern had more seats available a year ago.
   The airline's capacity declined 13.1 percent in March, to 4.50
billion available seat miles from 5.18 billion a year earlier.
   Last month, U.S. District Judge John Pratt in Washington
declared Eastern in contempt of court for trying to sell its
profitable Northeast shuttle to giant Texas Air Corp., Eastern's
parent.
   Eastern's management remains embroiled in negotiations with its
machinists union, which is fighting $490 million in proposed job
cuts at the airline.
   Ms. Musto said these problems had nothing to do with the
declining traffic figures.

<HEAD>Auction Of Fort Lauderdale Motels Falls Flat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many developers nibbled, but few
bit at beachfront hotels for sale at an auction designed to breathe
new life into a stretch of sand and surf battered by slumping
tourism and broken spring breaks.
   Only two of 11 properties sold at the private auction Thursday
night that was marked by bids thousands of dollars below what hotel
owners were seeking.
   ``These bidders don't realize they're buying Fort Lauderdale
Beach, not the backwoods of Maine,'' said Ed Wrobleski, a
Massachusetts factory worker who had sold his home and invested his
life savings last year to buy a hotel for $650,000.
   His property fetched a top bid of just $350,000.
   ``I'm not going to give my property away,'' Wrobleski said.
``We'll just hang in there and do the best we can.''
   Tourism officials and real estate analysts had viewed the
auction as a test of private interest in redeveloping the city's
beachfront strip.
   The city of Fort Lauderdale is planning a $13.8 million beach
revitalization as it tries to turn the beach from a spring break
haven into an area of luxury resorts. That plan hinges on private
development.
   ``If it busts, the negative connotation will be that the
potential to upgrade the property just isn't there,'' said Thomas
Powers, executive vice president of Goodkin Research Corp. in Fort
Lauderdale.
   The auction at the Bahia Mar Resort and Yachting Center drew
about 30 registered bidders and some 600 spectators.
   An 81-unit beachfront property sold for $2.1 million and an
18-unit motel sold for $542,000.
   Owners of the 11 properties agreed to the auction because the
decline of spring break has brought declining profits. They say
city officials in the past few years have restricted the students'
activities so much they have chosen to travel to other vacation
spots.
   ``I've worked hard, but after a while you get burned out on
beating your head against the wall,'' said Roger Handevidt, one
motel owner. ``I've tried to attract people down here and to
increase tourism in the area only to be shot down by the city.''
   Each property owner contributed $3,000 to an international
marketing campaign for the auction, to which co-organizer Fisher
Auction Co. Inc. added about $10,000.
   ``When you're talking about all-cash deals, it's difficult,''
said Lamar Fisher, senior vice president of the auction company.
``But we're hoping to negotiate several more deals in the next few
days.''

<HEAD>Springer Power Struggle Heats Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Cartel Office dealt a
serious blow to three shareholders' joint attempt to gain majority
control of Axel Springer Verlag, West Germany's largest publishing
company.
   Franz and Frieder Burda, who have their own printing operations,
and media entrepreneur Leo Kirch pooled their Springer shares last
month in an effort to forge a majority.
   But the Cartel Office said Friday that their combined shares had
fallen short of that goal.
   ``At the moment the pool has not had much of an effect. Leo
Kirch is still a long way even from 25 percent (of the shares),''
said Hartwig Wangemann, a spokesman for the Cartel Office.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for Springer employees said workers would
fight attempts by Kirch and the Burdas to gain control of the
company.
   The spokesman, Rolf Juergensen, said employees are worried that
Kirch would lead the company into extensive involvement with
electronic media, which could mean a loss of jobs for Springer's
print workers.
   The highly successful Springer empire includes the Bild tabloid
with a daily circulation of about 5 million and dozens of other
mass-circulation publications.
   Springer Chairman Peter Tamm urged that ``for the benefit of the
company, all participants (in the power struggle) reach a rational
solution as soon as possible.''
   Addressing a meeting of Springer employee representatives, Tamm
also said any solution should give top consideration to ``security
for workers ... and to a stable leadership.''
   Executives of the publishing house have been squabbling ever
since the death of company founder Axel Springer in 1985.
   Under a complicated formula, Springer's heirs and executors were
given control of 27.1 percent of the company shares, the Burda
brothers 25.9 percent and Kirch 10 percent. The rest were sold to
the public.
   Kirch had maintained that he gained support from the owners of
another 16 percent of Springer stock, which would give him and the
Burdas a combined majority.
   Friede Springer, the widow of the founder, has been fighting the
attempts by the Burdas and Kirch to gain majority control.
   Kirch is involved in film distribution and production and other
media areas. The Burda brothers own printing plants in West Germany.

   Grain and soybean futures prices advanced Friday
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans set new contracts high early in the session, then in a
wild finish slumped to the day's lows before reaching new highs
again.
   Large speculative buying, led by C&D Commodities Inc., accounted
for much of the activity, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``It was a day of wild gyrations,'' he said. ``There were some
big sellers, too, but I think this market does not want to go
down.''
   Wheat and corn futures also were higher, partly in response to
the performance in the bean pit. Wheat also got help from export
activity.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 4\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.16\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
2 cents higher with May at $2.09\ a bushel; oats were 1} cents to

<HEAD>First Chicago Reports Increased Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   First Chicago Corp., the nation's 10th largest bank holding
company, said Friday that its first-quarter profit more than
doubled from a year ago even though it raised its loan-loss
reserves to cover troubled Third World debt.
   Net income for the three months ended March 31 totaled $141.5
million, or $2.38 per share, compared with earnings of $63.9
million, or $1.06 a share, in 1987.
   Chairman Barry F. Sullivan said improvement was made across the
board during the period.
   ``Our performance this quarter was outstanding in all aspects of
the consumer and middle-market banks _ the superregional segment of
First Chicago _ as well as in the global corporate bank,'' he said
in a statement.
   Net interest income rose 14 percent, to $315.3 million from
$277.9 million last year, while interest expense totaled $615.92
million, up from $515.92 million.
   First Chicago said it increased its provision for loan losses to
$100 million from $75 million, half of which went to cover shaky
foreign debt.
   ``We are continuing to see improvements in credit quality ...
and we are continuing to maintian one of the strongest reserve
positions for troubled-country debtors among our peers,'' Sullivan
noted.
   Quarterly non-interest income totaled $249.0 million, compared
with $173.1 million last year. Non-interest expense rose to $311.5
million form $265.4 million.

<HEAD>International Banks Urge New Money Creation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund should create
about $29.5 billion worth of its own new money to help keep the
dollar and other world currencies stable and to help solve the
Third World debt problem, a leading group of the world's commercial
banks proposed Friday.
   The idea came from Horst Schulmann, the West German managing
director of the Institute of International Finance, which
represents 165 banks in 38 countries.
   ``Not every one of the banks would endorse every line, but
there's a consensus,'' Schulman told a news conference.
   His nine-page outline was made public on the eve of next week's
semiannual meeting in Washington of the fund and its sister
organization, the World Bank. Leading bankers and government
financial leaders are due to attend, including Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III.
   The new money would be given to member governments in proportion
to their status in the fund. That means the wealthiest countries
would get the biggest shares, including about $5.9 billion worth to
the United States alone. Britain would get more than $2 billion,
West Germany about $1.8 billion, France $1.5 billion and Japan $1.4
billion.
   Schulman says the United States could use this money for dealing
on currency exchange markets to keep the dollar stable while other
governments could hold more of this currency instead of dollars. At
the news conference, he suggested that many believe they already
hold too many dollars.
   The fund, owned by 151 governments, makes few public statements
and had no official comment on the proposal. Schulman said that he
has had favorable comment privately.
   Representatives of Third World countries and some wealthier
industrial governments have urged similar issues of new money by
the fund in past years. They have come up against stiff refusal
from U.S. officials who said it would promote inflation.
   The United States has the biggest single block of votes in fund
matters.
   Schulman wants the fund to create 21.4 billion more of its
``special drawing rights,'' known as SDR's. These are now worth
about $1.38 each, based on the price of four other major currencies
as well as the dollar: the West German mark, the British pound, the
French franc and the Japanese yen.
   SDR's are handled only by governments and a few special
governmental bodies. They exist not as coins or paper money but
only as entries in ledgers and computers.
   The 15 heavily-indebted Third World countries, singled out by
Baker for special help two years ago, would get about $3 billion
worth among them. Most of these countries are in Latin America.
   Third World governments have in the past asked that the rules be
changed so that their share would be larger, but Schulman gave no
support to that.
   ``It would be wrong to change the quotas in the fund,'' he said.
``These issues are for the needs of general international
liquidity.''
   He added that he did not rule out the possibility of the
wealthier countries turning over their shares to the bank and fund,
which could then make more loans to the Third World.
   Schulman acknowledged that critics of his plan might call it a
bailout for commercial banks.
   ``Commercial banks and other creditors would benefit from the
improved creditworthiness of debtor countries,'' the proposal says.
   It suggests that debtor countries could use their shares to buy
U.S. dollars as collateral for new borrowing from banks, or to
swing deals that would convert their old debts to banks into
something else that banks would prefer to have.
   One possibility is the debt-equity swap, in which debt owed by
Third World countries are exchanged at less than their face value
for shares in businesses.

<HEAD>Hachette Says It Would Sell Grolier's Childcraft Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French publisher Hachette S.A. said Friday it
has agreed to sell Grolier Inc.'s Childcraft Education Corp., which
markets educational toys by direct mail, if its $444 million
takeover bid for Grolier is successful.
   Grolier, meanwhile, said its board would meet on Monday to
consider Hachette's latest offer, president Andrew J. Reinhart said.
   On Wall Street, Grolier was unchanged at $26.37{ a share on the
New York Stock Exchange, or $2.37{ a share more than Hachette's
latest offer.
   Hachette said Walt Disney Co., the entertainment giant based in
Los Angeles, has tenatively agreed to buy the Childcraft unit for
$52 million, provided that Hachette's current tender offer for
Grolier is successful.
   Hachette, based in Paris, has offered $24 a share for the 18.5
million shares of Grolier's common stock that it does not already
control. The tender offer is scheduled to expire April 14. Hachette
and affiliates already own about 957,000 shares of Grolier stock.
   Grolier, which publishes encyclopedias and is based in Danbury,
Conn., has taken no position on the sweetened offer, but had
rejected as inadequate Hachette's March 13 offer of $21 a share.
   The company said at that time that it would pursue talks with
other interested parties to negotiate a sale for a satisfactory
price.
   Hachette boosted its tender offer to $24 a share on March 31.
   Grolier acquired Childcraft in 1986, and it made a profit on
sales of $51 million in 1987, said Reinhart, who is also chief
operating officer.

<HEAD>Alaska Airlines Schedules Siberia Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska Airlines has tentatively scheduled a May
31 flight between Nome, Alaska, and the Siberian city of
Provideniya.
   Soviet officials have yet to approve the flight, but
unofficially they appear to favor the idea, according to an Alaska
Chamber of Commerce official helping to organize the flight.
   ``There's a lot of interest from the Soviet Embassy in
Washington. It's aware of this project and they're excited about
possibly getting involved,'' said Shane Johnson, public relations
director for the chamber.
   Commercial flights between the United States and the Soviet
Union were banned for several years following the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan in 1979, but the prohibition was lifted about two
years ago.
   Pan American World Airways is the only U.S. airline that flies
between the two countries, operating flights between New York,
Leningrad and Moscow with a stopover in Frankfurt, West Germany.
Pan Am plans to introduce non-stop flights in a joint venture with
Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline, starting May 15.
   For most of the post-war era, almost all contact between Siberia
and Alaska has been cut off. And in recent years, the North Pacific
has been the scene of major military buildups by both nations.
   But last year relations began to warm. The Soviets allowed
American Lynn Cox to swim between two islands that straddle the
border in the Bering Sea, permitted an exchange of medical
researchers from Siberia and Alaska, and met with U.S. fishing
groups to discuss joint seafood ventures.
   Lou Cancelmi, an Alaska Airlines spokesman, said the airline
would donate the use of a plane for the half-hour flight between
Nome and the Siberian city. The carrier has applied for authority
to begin regularly scheduled service between the two cities next

   But Cancelmi stressed that Alaska Airlines still needs more
technical information about Provideniya's airport, as well as a
formal nod from the Soviets, before the May flight can take place.
   In addition to dignitaries, the flight would also carry a group
of western Alaska Eskimos who hope to be reunited with long-lost
relatives in Siberia.
   The flight is part of a broader initiative that state,
university and chamber officials have launched to improve Alaska's
relations with the Soviet Union.
   Known as the Siberian Gateway Project, the goals include
expanded trade and tourism between Alaska and Siberia.
   On April 23, the project will sponsor a symposium in Anchorage
on Siberia-Alaska relations that will feature Gennadi Gerasimov,
chief spokesman for Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Hunts, Banks Near Settlement of Dispute Involving $1.5 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dallas Hunt brothers and the 23 foreign and
domestic banks they are battling are nearing settlement in their
dispute over $1.5 billion in loans, attorneys said.
   Both sides have asked a federal bankruptcy judge to suspend
reorganization hearings on the Hunts' Placid Oil Co. until the
negotiations are complete, attorneys said.
   ``Negotiations are at the stage where the major parties have
come to what I call a handshake deal,'' Placid attorney Henry W.
Simon said Thursday. ``That deal is not in writing, and the
handshake is not now binding, but it does represent at least a
conclusion of an intensive series of all the Placid-related
issues.''
   Neither Simon nor First RepublicBank Corp. attorney Paul Wickes
_ key negotiators for the case _ would discuss the substance of the
negotiations. But the settlement would have to include what to do
about $200 million in penalty interest, attorney fees and costs the
banks claim against Placid.
   Nelson Bunker Hunt, William Herbert Hunt and Lamar Hunt filed
suit in federal court nearly two years ago against the 23 banks,
alleging they were fraudulently squeezing the Hunts into accepting
increasingly difficult loan terms for a $1.5 billion debt.
   A countersuit was filed by the banks, demanding immediate
payment on what the banks contended were legitimate loans in
default.
   Six weeks later, the banks posted for foreclosure key Hunt
assets securing the defaulted loans. The Hunts protected themselves
by placing Placid and William Herbert's personal trust under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. They later did the same
with the other brothers' trusts.
   Both sides have since been warring in federal and bankruptcy
courts, maneuvering for a possible death blow or at least some kind
of legal advantage.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson in January allowed the
banks a $7.8 million first lien against revenues from the Hunts'
Green Canyon drilling project in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The lien represented money Placid had spent on Green Canyon in
violation of a court order. When the Hunts experienced cost
overruns _ including the loss of nine miles of pipe being towed to
the site _ the project's outside investors declined to cover the
loss.
   The outside investors, Dallas Mavericks owner Don Carter and
Oklahoma media giant Ed Gaylord, said they would commit more money
only if the bankruptcy judge put those funds ahead of the banks'
prior lien.
   The banks' desire to close Green Canyon, and Abramson's balking
at considering the need for additional money an emergency,
``brought Placid to the table,'' one bank attorney said.
   Without Green Canyon, Placid's reorganization plan would be
untenable and, by default, Abramson would have accepted the bank
plan calling for the outright sale of Placid.

   USA Today will probably lose money in 1988,
following a profitable quarter at the end of 1987, John J. Curley,
Gannett Co. Inc. president and chief executive officer says.
   Curley, speaking to reporters Thursday after a meeting with
securities analysts, attributed the projected loss to expected
increases in the cost of newsprint. Newspaper executives expect
newsprint costs in 1988 to be 18 percent to 20 percent higher than
last year.
   The national daily, founded by Gannett on Sept. 15, 1982,
reported its first quarterly profit in the three months of 1987.
   USA Today has a circulation of 1.6 million. It is one of 90
daily newspapers, 35 non-daily newspapers and a newspaper magazine
published by Gannett. The company also operates 10 television
stations, 16 radio stations, a news service and an outdoor
advertising company.

   The stock market extended its rally of the past
three sessions today with a strong advance that carried the Dow
Jones industrial average to a new high since the October crash.
   The market has benefited lately from signs that the dollar has
steadied in foreign-exchange, reducing fears that the Federal
Reserve might soon tighten credit.
   In the credit markets today, prices of long-term government
bonds rose more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, putting
their yields in the 8.7-8.75 percent range.
   Analysts said traders were anticipating the possibility of
favorable news next week on the dollar and international trade. It
could come, they say, from a meeting of the so-called Group of
Seven industrialized nations in Washington, or from the Commerce
Department's monthly report on the U.S. trade balance for February.
   Advance estimates call for the trade data to show continuing
improvement from the record levels it reached last fall.
   Brokers also say investors are looking for generally strong
corporate earnings reports for the first quarter over the next few
weeks.

<HEAD>Sharon Steel, British Investor Bid For Idle Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bankruptcy court judge is expected to rule
Monday on which of the bidders from around the world should be
authorized to buy major portions of an idled Wheeling-Pittsburgh
Steel Corp. plant.
   Bids for the plant in Monessen, Westmoreland County, came from
Australia, Britain, South Africa, California and Pennsylvania.
   The plant is on the block as part of Wheeling-Pittsburgh's
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws.
   The bids were considered by Bentz on Thursday, which was the
deadline. The judge postponed his decision over the objection of
Wheeling-Pittsburgh's creditors.
   The sale is a crucial issue in Monessen, whose economy has
suffered through the loss of 3,500 jobs that once existed at the
plant.
   The front-runners appeared to be British industrialist Michael
Wilkinson and Sharon Steel Corp., a holding of Miami Beach
financier Victor Posner that is also in Chapter 11.
   Sharon bid $16 million for the coke batteries, iron and steel
furnaces and related rolling mills. BMAC Corp., Wilkinson's
California company, offered $15 million. Both bids carried complex
conditions on payment schedules, interest rates, royalties and
other issues.
   Sharon Steel's chief executive, Walter Sieckman, said his
company desperately needs a supply of coke to fuel its newly
refurbished ironmaking furnace in Mercer County.
   Sieckman said Sharon might be forced to close one of its two
blast furnaces if it cannot get coke from Monessen, and a Sharon
Steel attorney threatened to withdraw the bid because Bentz would
not rule immediately.
   BMAC until recently was the only bidder for the plant. The
company signed a letter of intent in December to buy the coke
ovens, which convert coal to blast furnace fuel.
   Australian businessman Colin Good offered $60 million for the
entire plant, but Bentz said the offer ``had conditions in it that
are impossible to meet.'' Among them was a requirement that
Wheeling-Pittsburgh, whose primary plant is in Steubenville, Ohio,
to purchase 22 million tons of low-grade iron ore from him over the
next 10 years.
   Mon Valley Steel Co., a local investors' group led by Monessen
businessman Frank Carlow, bid $14 million for all but the plant's
rail mill, which forms semi-finished steel into rail for
transportation.
   Carlow was unwilling to drop an important condition that could
deduct $2 million from the purchase price. Sharon Steel and BMAC
agreed to drop the same condition.
   Bentz, meanwhile, granted the Economic Development
Administration a 120-day extension to solicit new bids for the
7-year-old rail mill, the centerpiece of the Monessen Works. The
EDA helped finance the mill, foreclosed and is selling it to
recover public funds.
   The South African steel producer ISCOR Ltd. of Pretoria and
Sharon Steel submitted separate bids for the plant's continuous
bloom caster, a machine that shapes molten steel into semi-finished
forms for the rail mill's use.

<TEXT>
   Women in sales forces tend to represent a
strong portion of housewares, publishing and food products
industries, but few sell tools, hardware and general machinery, a
study found.
   ``Over the past decade, the most significant advances for women
in sales have been in banking, financial services, utilities and
publishing,'' said William O'Connell, head of sales management
practice for the company that conducted the study, Personnel
Corporation of America.
   ``In these industries, where there is no apparent gender-related
consumer bias, sheer numbers women have equalled or surpassed their
male counterparts on the sales force,'' O'Connell said Friday.
   The data for the study, conducted earlier this year, came from
12,000 salespeople employed by nearly 350 companies representing 40
industries.
   According to the study, the industries with the greatest
percentage of women in their sales forces are textile and apparel,
utilities, banks and financial services, housewares, publishing and
food products.
   The industries with the smallest percentage of women in their
sales forces are general machinery, aerospace, transportation
equipment, tools and hardware, automotive parts and fabricated
metal products, the study found.
   ``Our hypothesis is that selling such technical items as tools
and hardware requires some engineering and technical background,
which statistics have shown, women have not gotten into,''
O'Connell said.
   But, he said, the sales managers he surveyed indicated that
women tend to be better performers in the industries where they are
selling.

   The dollar drifted lower Friday while the
British pound held its ground despite an apparent attempt by the
Bank of England to stem its rise by slashing interest rates.
   Gold prices were higher. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold was bid at $449 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up 15 cents an
ounce from $448.85 late Thursday.
   Trading in the dollar remained hemmed in a narrow range before a
meeting next week in Washington, D.C., of the Group of Seven major
industrialized democracies.
   Dealers said they expect the finance ministers of the United
States, Britain, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada to
reaffirm their wish to keep the dollar stable.
   ``The central banks are very happy about what they've done over
the past few months. They've taken a lot of the speculative
character out of the market _which is bad for the traders, of
course,'' said Peter Wild, first vice president of Switzerland's
Bank Julius Baer & Co. in New York.
   The foreign exchange market was taken by surprise when the Bank
of England engineered a half-point cut in the commercial banks'
base lending rate to 8 percent at midday in London.
   But the rate cut ``appears to have gotten the same reaction as
yesterday's intervention,'' said Ken de la Salle, a senior manager
at National Westminster Bank PLC's foreign exchange department in
London.
   The Bank of England intervened Thursday to stem sterling's rise,
also with minimal results.
   Other traders pointed out that British interest rates are still
higher than in other countries. That makes pound-denominated
investments more attactive and boosts demand for the currency.
   In London, the pound was quoted at $1.8755 compared with late
Thursday's $1.8670. Later in New York the pound finished the day at
$1.8757, unchanged from late Thursday.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar fell 0.52 yen to a closing 125.18 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted at a higher rate of 125.50 yen. At the end of the
trading day in New York, the dollar finished at 125.68, down from
125.72 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.6742 West German marks, down from 1.6776;
1.3842 Swiss francs, down from 1.3864; 1.2469 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.2483; 5.6775 French francs, down from 5.6885; and
1,241.13 Italian lire, down from 1,243.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.6725 West German marks, down from 1.6810; 1.3825 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3897; 5.6715 French francs, down from 5.7022;
1.8790 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8865; 1,241.75 Italian lire,
down from 1,246.50; and 1.2478 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2448.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $451.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $447.75. In Zurich, gold was rose to
a bid $449.50 an ounce compared with $448 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.06 to close at a bid $450.72
an ounce.
   At the end of the trading day in New York, gold bullion for
current delivery was bid at $451.60 a troy ounce late in the day,
up from $450.80 late Thursday.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London to a late bid price of
$6.48 a troy ounce, compared with Thursday's $6.40. On New York's
Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose to a late bid of
$6.410 from $6.407 late Thursday.

   Microsoft Corp., answering Apple Computer Inc.'s
copyright lawsuit, has filed a suit seeking unspecified damages
from Apple for alleged breach of contract, slander and interfering
with Microsoft's relationships with its customers.
   Microsoft also asked for punitive damages against Apple plus
payment of attorney fees in its suit, which was filed Thursday in
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San
Jose.
   The Microsoft action was in response to a March 17 suit filed in
the same court against it and Hewlett-Packard Corp. by Apple, which
charged them with infringing upon copyright audio and visual
display technology for Macintosh personal computers.
   Apple's civil suit said software products made by
Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft make use of Macintosh technology
without permission.
   Microsoft's counterclaims and answer asked that Apple's suit be
dismissed. It also sought damages against the Cupertino, Calif.,
computer maker for breach of contract between the two companies,
for interference with Microsoft's contractual relations with other
companies, for harming Microsoft's ``prospective business
advantage,'' for slander of Microsoft's title to its Windows 2.03
software product and for violations of California unfair business
and practices laws.
   Apple spokesmen failed to return phone calls Friday seeking
comment on the lawsuit.
   Apple's suit had said Microsoft's Windows 2.03, a graphics
program used with Hewlett-Packard software, are ``illegal copies of
the Macintosh audio-visual works and exceed the limited license
rights Apple previously granted to Microsoft.''
   The suit asked that Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard be prevented
from copying, selling or marketing Hewlett-Packard's New Wave
software and Windows 2.03. Apple also sought unspecified damages.
   Windows operates with IBM and compatible computers using
Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system. New Wave provides an
audio-visual display upon which applications software can be run.
   In its countersuit, Microsoft said Windows 2.03 doesn't infringe
on any Apple copyright or patent and that Microsoft didn't
contribute to any alleged copyright infringement by Hewlett-Packard.
   The software company also asked the court to require Apple to
live up to a 1985 settlement agreement concerning the use of the
visual displays in question.

<TEXT>
   Tate & Lyle PLC, a major British sugar refiner and
distributor, announced Friday a $1.33 billion cash tender offer for
Staley Continental Inc., the second largest refiner of corn
sweeteners in the United States.
   Tate & Lyle, which already owns nearly 5 percent of Staley's
stock, said it was offering $32 a share for all the remaining
common stock.
   Staley Continental, which is based in Rolling Meadows, Ill.,
will have no comment on any aspect of the offer until its lawyers
examine the proposal, said spokesman David Satterfield.
   But there was speculation the bidding may go higher. Staley
climbed $5.87{ a share to $37.37{ in active trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Lynton Wilson, North American managing director for Tate & Lyle,
said at a Springfield, Ill., news conference that the $32 price was
fair.
   ``We prepared to launch our bid at a time when the price for
Staley shares was in the low 20s,'' Wilson said. ``I don't know
what may happen to the price on the market but we believe the $32
is a full and fair offer for the shares of the company.''
   Wilson said Tate & Lyle's interest in the company ``is a
fundamental interest in the business,'' not a passing financial
interest.
   ``We're not financial entrepreneurs or corporate raiders,'' he
said. ``We're manufacturing people involved in the processing
businesses not only here in North America but in other countries as
well.''
   Tate & Lyle said Staley had previously proposed that Tate
increase its stake acquired in November and become a more
substantial minority shareholder.
   But Tate & Lyle said it decided to launch the tender offer
instead.
   The acquisition would give Tate & Lyle its first interest in the
U.S. corn sweetener market. Tate & Lyle said it would become the
only supplier of all three types of sugar _ corn, beet and cane _
in the United States.
   ``We are confident that, as part of Tate & Lyle's North American
division, the performance and competitive position of Staley's corn
activities will be significantly enhanced,'' said Tate & Lyle
Chairman Neil Shaw.
   The tender offer represents a 78 percent premium to Staley's
share price of $18 a share before the Tate & Lyle stake was
announced.
   Staley's stock price was boosted in March by speculation that a
foreign concern would launch a bid for the company.
   Staley Continental is a holding company formed in early 1985 for
the A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co., a leading corn processor, and
CFS Continental Inc., a food service supplier acquired in late 1984.
   Tate & Lyle said Staley is the second largest refiner of corn
sweeteners in the United States behind Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.,
based in Decatur, Ill.
   Staley's principal corn product is high fructose corn syrup,
known as HFCS. The company has around 25 percent of the $1 billion
a year U.S. market for HFCS sales, Tate & Lyle said.
   In a letter to Staley released in New York, Tate's Shaw said
Staley had moved away from its core business of corn processing in
recent years, scaled back corn sweetener operations and expanded
into foodservice distribution.
   ``In our view it is time to return Staley to basics,'' Shaw
wrote.
   Tate & Lyle said it intends to sell Staley's food distribution
business, which Staley acquired in 1984 for $396 million, and that
it was prepared to consider any offers immediately.
   The proceeds of that sale would be used to reduce Tate & Lyle's
debt incurred by the acquisition, it said.
   Tate & Lyle also said it planned, after the merger, to move the
company's headquarters to Decatur, where its corn wet milling
operations have been based for years.
   Tate & Lyle said it began legal action in the United States to
overturn takeover defenses established by Staley, including a
benefit package for its senior management.
   Tate & Lyle said the offer will be partly funded by the sale of
new shares to its existing shareholders, cash resources and a bank
loan.
   The acquisition and stock issue must be approved by Tate &
Lyle's shareholders, who are to meet on May 3. The tender offer is
scheduled to expire May 5 unless extended.
   Staley earned $57.3 million on revenue of $3.4 billion in the
year ended in September.
   Tate and Lyle had a pre-tax profit of 92 million pounds, or
about $173 million, on revenue of 1.7 billion pounds, or $3.2
billion, in the same time period.

   The stock market rang up its fourth straight
gain Friday with a strong advance that carried the Dow Jones
industrial average to a new high since the October crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 28.02 points to
2,090.19, bringing its gain for the week to 102.13 points.
   The average's previous closing high for the year was 2,087.37 on
March 18.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,110 up, 440 down and 428 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 169.30 million shares, against 177.84
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index rose
1.75 to 152.03.
   The market has benefited lately from signs that the dollar has
steadied in foreign-exchange, reducing fears that the Federal
Reserve might soon tighten credit.
   In the credit markets Friday, prices of long-term government
bonds rose more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, putting
their yields in the 8.7-8.75 percent range.
   Analysts said traders were anticipating the possibility of
favorable news next week on the dollar and international trade. It
could come, they say, from a meeting of the so-called Group of
Seven industrialized nations in Washington, or from the Commerce
Department's monthly report on the U.S. trade balance for February.
   Advance estimates call for the trade data to show continuing
improvement from the record levels it reached last fall.
   Brokers also say investors are looking for generally strong
corporate earnings reports for the first quarter over the next few
weeks.
   Staley Continental led the active list and jumped 5~ to 37|.
Tate & Lyle PLC of Great Britain announced a $32-a-share offer for
the company's stock.
   Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, another company in the
corn-processing business, rose 1[ to 22|.
   General Electric, whose first-quarter earnings report Thursday
got favorable reviews from analysts, gained 1\ to 42{.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines picked up 2] to 111|; Ford Motor 1[ to 46|; Eastman Kodak
\ to 42, and American Telephone & Telegraph [ to 28[.
   Quantum Corp. fell 1 to 10\ in the over-the-counter market. The
company said it would have a loss for the quarter and fiscal year
ended March 31 arising from a one-time charge related to a
changeover in its disk drive production facilities.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $27.35 billion, or
1.03 percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 197.80 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 3.87 to 313.60,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.27 at 269.43.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 2.95 to 381.83. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 300.49, up 1.11.

   Five OPEC leaders gathered here Friday
for talks that analysts said would test the cartel's resolve to
combat a global oil price slump.
   Prices on world markets slipped slightly in quiet trading. Brent
blend crude from the North Sea traded in London for May delivery at
$15.60 a barrel, down 10 cents from Thursday's close. At the New
York Mercantile Exchange, May contracts for West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, stood at $16.88 per barrel,
down 18 cents.
   Indonesia's oil minister said on his arrival that the meeting,
set to start Saturday, was unlikely to produce any changes in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' current oil policy.
   ``I don't think we'll decide anything that will change the past
decision of OPEC,'' the minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, told
reporters as he prepared for his first OPEC session since taking
over his country's top oil post in March.
   In the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh, the official Saudi press
agency quoted King Fahd as calling on OPEC to display greater
solidarity. It said he accused some unidentified cartel members of
cheating on OPEC rules by offering price discounts.
   Last December, OPEC agreed to retain existing oil production
quotas for the individual member countries in hope of holding
prices at $18 a barrel. A barrel is the equivalent of 42 gallons.
   Since then, however, open-market prices for OPEC oil have
slipped to levels between $15 and $18 a barrel, despite
stronger-than-usual efforts by the key producers to abide by their
production quotas.
   Paul McDonald, a London-based oil consultant, said OPEC oil
production in March probably was not much above its official
ceiling for 12 members of 15.06 million barrels a day. Iraq, the
13th member, is not included in the December agreement and is
believed to be pumping about 2.5 million barrels daily.
   Thus total OPEC output is thought to be about 17.6 million
barrels daily.
   ``It beats me what they can do'' now to drive prices back up to
$18 a barrel, McDonald said in a telephone interview.
   The five OPEC ministers, representing Saudi Arabia, Nigeria,
Venezuela, Algeria and Indonesia, are expected to assess oil market
conditions and recommend action for the next full meeting of the
cartel, which is set for June 8 here.
   Ginandjar told reporters he saw little chance that a special
conference of all 13 members would be called before June.
   Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister and chairman of the
weekend meeting, said OPEC was not satisfied with the current level
of oil prices.
   ``We wanted a price of $18; we haven't got it,'' he told
reporters Thursday. He declined to discuss possible actions to
raise the price.
   The five OPEC ministers, constituting the cartel's recently
created price-monitoring committee, also are to review a Dutch
auditing firm's report on January and February production levels by
individual OPEC members.
   One of OPEC's biggest problems in seeking to influence oil
prices through production controls is a lack of timely and reliable
information about the production of its own members. Some,
including Persian Gulf war rivals Iran and Iraq, consider such data
to be state secrets.
   Some analysts said OPEC had to cut its production further in
order to reverse the decline in prices.
   ``The market is signaling that this is what is needed, but I
don't see it happening,'' said Graham Andrews, an analyst at the
investment firm of Wood, Mackenzie and Co. in London.
   Andrews said there was not much Saturday's meeting could do,
given the continuing worldwide oversupply of oil and OPEC's
inability to agree on new output cuts.
   ``I suspect it's going to be brave words but not anything more
than that,'' he said.
   Andrews said he believed oil prices in the open market were
likely to decline by as much as $1.50 a barrel over the next two
month before stabilizing.
   Although this weekend's talks may not influence the short-term
direction of prices, they may provide clues about shifts in OPEC's
long-term strategy.
   A key question for OPEC now is whether to resort to its
traditional tactic of cutting production in an effort to bolster
prices.
   Some analysts think a consensus among key OPEC members may be
emerging that the cartel should draw a line on sacrificing
production, since non-OPEC producers such as Mexico and the Soviet
Union are only taking up the production slack that OPEC has
created. As a result OPEC has been losing on both volume and price.

   International Business Machines Corp., moving to
earn more money on its intellectual property, said Friday it will
raise the ceiling on its patent license fees to 5 percent from the
current 1 percent.
   The decision is likely to put pressure on the profit margins of
companies that require licenses to make products compatible with
those of IBM, the world's largest computer company.
   IBM holds 9,000 U.S. patents and more than 23,000 counterpart
patents around the world. The decision does not affect existing
license agreements.
   IBM's announcement came just weeks before the expected
announcement of computers compatible with IBM's year-old Personal
System-2 personal computer.
   ``They certainly intend to cash in on their development effort''
on the Personal System-2, said Jack W. Wilson, an analyst for
Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif.
   IBM also said it was reaffirming its long-standing practice of
making its patents generally available for licensing to others
under reasonable terms and conditions.
   Some companies refuse to license some of their patents or
license them selectively, to particular companies, IBM spokesman
John Mihalec noted. He said IBM makes its patents generally
available ``because it's good for the industry.''
   Under the new rates, licensees will pay a maximum of 1 percent
of sales revenue on a product using a single IBM patent. They will
pay up to 5 percent of sales revenue on products using multiple
patents, depending on the number of patents used and the extent of
their use.
   Under the old rates, which were last changed 10 years ago, the
maximum royalty was 1 percent regardless of the number of patents
used.
   License fees of 3 to 5 percent are fairly common in industry,
said David Carnevale, director of the microcomputer service of
InfoCorp, a consulting and research company based in Cupertino,
Calif.
   ``I would say that's in the ballpark,'' agreed Richard L.
Bernacchi, an intellectual-property attorney in Los Angeles. He
said patents have become more valuable since the federal court
system has become more consistent in enforcing them.
   Many companies have cross-licensing agreements with IBM that
allow the companies to use each other's patents without fees for
specified periods. In other cases, the agreements provide for free
use of certain patents and require payment for use of others.
   ``Any licensee can look at the license they have from IBM and
figure out what they're covered for,'' Mihalec said.
   Tandy Corp., one of the companies rumored to be preparing to
announce a Personal System-2 computer, has a long-standing
cross-licensing agreement with IBM, according to Ed Juge, director
of market planning.
   Amdahl Corp., which makes big mainframe computers that run the
same software as IBM's mainframes, also has a cross-licensing
agreement with IBM, which expires at the end of 1991, spokesman
Bill Stewart said.
   ``It will have no current effect on us,'' Stewart said.
   IBM noted that a patent license is not a license to copy
products that use the covered patent. It is not a transfer of the
technology or trade secrets that went into developing a product and
it does not allow a licensee to infringe other forms of
intellectual property rights such as copyrights.
   IBM has said it has applied for both patents and copyrights on
Micro Channel Architecture, the internal data pathway that is a
critical part of its new Personal System-2.

<HEAD>Discount Real Estate Broker Closing Doors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A real estate company that tried to be a
maverick by selling homes for fees well below the prevailing rate
is going out of business eight months after opening.
   Barclay & Stubbs is being forced to close its doors mainly
because it could not attract top agents, Elizabeth F. Kinzly, the
company's president, said Thursday.
   The real estate agency was offering to sell houses for a 3{
percent commission, sharply below the going rate of 6 percent.
Buyers were also being offered a 1 percent bonus for purchasing a
home listed by Barclay & Stubbs.
   Agents for the company were offered a salary instead of the
standard commission _ a factor that others in the real estate
business had predicted would hinder Barclay & Stubbs' recruitment
efforts.
   Kinzly said she believed agents were reluctant to join the
company because of fear of something new and concern about how they
would be viewed by others in the business.
   If Barclay represented both the buyer and the seller, the agency
would net only a 2{ percent commission. Other brokerages were
offered a 2 percent shared commission, so Barclay's net commission
could be as little as half a percent.
   Although real estate commissions are negotiable, most are 6
percent, shared equally between the listing and selling brokers.
   The company had sold four or five houses, and had deposits on
another six, Kinzly said, adding that many of the sales had been on
a shared-commission basis.
   A few dozen homeowners had listed their houses with the agency,
and ``things were picking up a lot,'' said Kinzly.
   She said she disagreed with Chairman Benjamin Morris' decision
to quit now. Kinzly said she would have liked to see the company
remain in business at least through the spring house-selling season.
   ``That could have made it go,'' she said.
   The company had been at the center of a controversy in the real
estate community after it sued four area brokers in February,
charging unfair trade practices and conspiracy to restrain trade.
   The other brokers had offered Barclay a lower shared commission
than that offered to other agencies.
   Last month, a judge granted a motion by two of the defendants to
have the case referred to the Greater New Haven Board of Realtors
for arbitration. One of the other companies reached a settlement
with Barclay.

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Advance Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle futures advanced sharply Friday on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, reflecting expectations of improved beef demand.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures moved higher, energy
futures declined and precious metals were slightly higher.
   Livestock traders got clipped earlier in the week with limit
declines in some cattle deliveries.
   ``Now we've gone a long way to return a little optimism to the
market,'' said Philip Stanley, an analyst in Chicago with Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc.
   There seemed to be a general belief that cash cattle prices will
improve next week along with wholesale beef, he said.
   ``The expectations are for improved demand throughout the beef
trade,'' said Stanley. ``There should be a return of retail
interest in beef and the packers will have to buy live animals
because they've done little of it in recent days.''
   Hog and pork belly futures also did well, in part because of
spillover support from the cattle pit, Stanley said.
   ``Also, a lot of traders are expecting a seasonal bottom in hog
prices,'' he said.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to 1.47 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in April at 74.77 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .10 cent lower to .58 cent higher with April at 80.10
cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent lower to .70 cent higher
with April at 45.37 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .70
cent to 1.15 cents higher with May at 54.47 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices advanced on the Chicago Board
of Trade.
   Soybeans set contracts high early in the session, then in a wild
finish slumped to the day's lows before reaching new highs again.
   Large speculative buying, led by C&D Commodities Inc., accounted
for much of the activity, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``It was a day of wild gyrations,'' he said. ``There were some
big sellers, too, but I think this market does not want to go
down.''
   The market is expecting a government report coming out Monday to
show a further drawdown in soybean stocks, said Lespinasse.
   ``This would give a very low stocks-to-usage ratio,'' he said.
``So if any problems develop with the weather later this spring or
summer, this market could explode to the upside.''
   Wheat and corn futures also were higher, partly in response to
the performance in the bean pit. Wheat also got help from export
activity.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 4{ cents higher with the May contract
at $3.16} a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 cents higher with May at
$2.09 a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 3{ cents higher with May at
$1.66} a bushel; and soybeans were 5 cents to 8 cents higher with
May at $6.78 a bushel.
   Energy futures took a dip, heading into the weekend meeting of
the OPEC pricing committee.
   ``Up to this morning there was some speculation that there might
be a surprise'' coming out of the meeting that would send prices
higher, said Michael Rothman, senior oil analyst in New York with
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   A change of feeling came on remarks by OPEC President Rilwanu
Lukman, who indicated the pricing committee would meet only one
day, said Rothman.
   The implication is that the session would be a perfunctory one,
with no recommendation for a special OPEC meeting or for production
cuts.
   ``Those anticipations were put to rest today by Lukman's
remarks,'' said Rothman.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 18 cents to 20 cents lower with the May contract
at $16.88 a barrel; heating oil was .27 cent to .57 cent lower with
May at 45.46 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to
.45 cent lower with May at 48.77 cents a gallon.
   Stock index futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange advanced
with the June contract for the Standard & Poor's 500 index settling
at 269.90, up 2.30 points. The underlying spot index was up 3.27 at
269.43.
   Precious metals futures advanced slightly on the Commodity
Exchange in New York.
   Gold was 70 cents to $1 higher with the June contract at $453.70
a troy ounce; and silver was .3 cent to .4 cent higher with May at
$6.438 a troy ounce.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hughes Aircraft Co., a unit of General Motors
Corp., said Thursday it has agreed to buy Rediffusion Similation,
one of the world's largest suppliers of flight simulators, for $283
million.
   Rediffusion, which is based in Crawley, England, and has
operations in Arlington, Texas, is owned by BET Ltd., a
conglomerate headquartered in London.
   Rediffusion manufactures 40 percent of the military flight
simulators in the Untied Kingdom and 35 percent of the simulators
for training pilots of U.S. and other foreign airlines.
   Hughes is one of the world's leading suppliers of
high-technology electronics for military, scientific and commercial
use.
   Acquisition of Rediffusion will expand Hughes' existing
operations in the pilot-training field. Hughes currently builds a
weapons tactics trainer for the F-A18 jet and the mission trainer
for the F-14A jet.
   Rediffusion, with a work force of 2,500 and annual sales of
about $260 million, will be operated as a subsidiary of Hughes.
   ``Hughes expects that simulators will be used increasingly by
military customers to train pilots and operators as defense budgets
flatten out,'' said Albert Wheelon, chairman and chief executive of
Hughes, adding that the acquisition will ``make Hughes a a major
factor in this field.''
   The current world market for military and civilian simulators is
$3 billion a year and that is expected to grow to $4 billion a year
by 1993.
   Hughes said it expects the use of simulators will be expanded
into non-aircraft areas, such as factory automation and machine
repair.

<HEAD>Boeing's New 747 Delayed By Electrical Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first flight of Boeing Co.'s new 747-400
jumbo jet has been delayed by electrical problems, the company said.
   Dean Thornton, president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said
Wednesday that the first deliveries of the plane, which was
formally introduced by Boeing in January, are still expected in
December but aren't a certainty.
   Northwest Airlines and Singapore Airlines both said they are
scheduled to receive two of the planes in December.
   Analysts said that if the four planes planned for December
delivery are delayed into January, Boeing's 1988 sales could be
reduced by about $500 million and pre-tax operating profits could
be cut by as much as $100 million.
   Phil Brannon, an aerospace analyst with Merrill Lynch in New
York, said he estimates Boeing would receive close to $25 million
in operating profit on each 747-400. Paul Nisbet, analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, estimated each plane
could generate $35 million in profit.
   Thornton said it is possible the airplane's problems could delay
certification of the jetliner by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   The first flight had been scheduled for March 21, but Thornton
said he now expects it to be ``the latter part of this month.''
   Thornton said the electrical problems involve the main power
generation system.
   He said the new 747, the world's largest commercial jetliner,
has proven to be more complex to build than originally expected.
   The sophisticated electronics of the plane include a
computerized cockpit that allows for a crew of two, rather than the
three required on the earlier 747s. Also, the four-engine plane has
improved aerodynamics with a bigger wingspan and added vertical
winglets at their tips. It is powered by new engines.
   Thornton said the job also has been complicated by ``customer
pressure to change things, to tailor-make it to suit their
requirements.''
   The 747-400 is designed to carry as many as 479 passengers and
has a range of 8,000 miles.
   Northwest, the initial customer for the plane, has ordered 10 of
the jets with spare parts, worth $1.5 billion. Singapore Airlines
has ordered 14 and taken options for six others, for a total value
of $3.3 billion.
   Boeing has received $13 billion to $14 billion in firm orders
for 118 of the jets, plus options for 66 others. Each plane sells
for about $125 million.
   Boeing had profit of $480 million, or $3.10 a share, on sales of
$15.35 billion in 1987. The company expects sales of $17 billion
this year.

<TEXT>
   Cheaply-manufactured textiles from China
and other nations fueled a 17 percent increase in the textile trade
deficit in 1987 while taking away jobs from Americans, industry
representatives said Thursday.
   Members of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, meeting
here through Saturday, said that unless federal legislation is
passed setting a 1 percent annual ceiling on import growth, textile
production in the United States could cease by the mid-1990s.
   Imported clothing now accounts for 54 percent of all garments
sold in the United States, according to institute figures.
   About 2.2 million people make their living in the nation's
textile industry, according to institute figures. This represents a
loss of about 350,000 jobs since 1980, including 10,000 jobs lost
in March alone, said Robert G. Laidlaw, president of the group. He
blamed the situation in part of the Reagan Administration's failure
to enforce import quotas.
   Laidlaw urged passage of the Textile and Apparel Trade Act,
which faces a vote in the Senate next month.
   The U.S. imposed an embargo against the Soviet Union last year
after the Soviet Union exported 12 million yards of fabric to the
U.S. instead of the 4 million yards provided under U.S. quotas, he
said. But Laidlaw added the embargo was lifted when Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev visited the U.S. He said a 1988 limit was set at
23.5 million yards.
   ``The government is happily giving away our industry, and people
are not going to re-invest if they don't have confidence,'' said
Laidlaw.
   The primary competition comes from government-subsidized
manufacturers in China, Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and other nations
producing textiles for as little as 20 cents an hour in wages.
   ``On an even field, the U.S. industry can compete with anyone,''
said Christopher Bonner, institute spokesman. ``But it can't
compete when governments subsidize exports made by low-wage earners
in deplorable conditions that would be illegal in the U.S. It's
crazy.''
   U.S. Department of Commerce figures show imports of textiles and
apparel in 1987 reached a record $29 billion, while exports totaled
$4 billion. The industry's $24.8 billion trade deficit for textiles
and apparel now equals 14.5 percent of the nation's overall trade
deficit, according to Laidlaw.
   ``If we look at the growth of the nation's overall trade deficit
from 1986 to 1987, one fourth of that diastrous growth has been at
the expense of the U.S. textile and apparel industry and its 2
million employees,'' he said.

<HEAD>Quaker State Gets Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OIL CITY, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investor group led by a New York-based
investment banking firm said Friday it is offering $695 million to
buy Quaker State Corp., the motor oil refining company.
   Ardshiel Inc. said it is offering $26.50 per share for the Oil
City-based company, which refines and sells Quaker State motor oil,
owns Quaker State Minit-Lube Inc. drive-in automobile lubrication
centers, and manufactures truck lighting systems and automobile
brake lights.
   Quaker State common stock closed at $22.62{ per share, up $1, in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading Friday before
Ardshiel's offer was made public.
   Ardshiel said it currently owns about 3.3 percent interest in
the company. It did not disclose the identities of other investors.
   Quaker State spokesman Ben Faulkner said the company had no
comment on the offer.
   Rumors have been circulating for weeks that an offer was in the
works, although it was expected to be about $30 per share or
higher, said Edward Farmer, a broker with Butcher & Singer in
Pittsburgh.
   Ardshiel said it might be willing to raise the offer. It said it
has enough money to fund the acquisition.
   Dennis McCormick, Ardshiel's senior managing director, said
Ardshiel wanted to continue Quaker State's core businesses.
   ``Surveys indicate that Quaker State Corp. is one of the 10
best-recognized consumer brand names and we believe the value of
that name recognition and Quaker State Corp.'s position have not
been fully developed,'' McCormick said.
   McCormick said Ardshiel would ``accelerate growth'' of the
company's Minit-Lube subsidiary based in Salt Lake City. Faulkner
said the subsidiary, the company's latest area of expansion, has
grown to 280 outlets in 20 states in the last few years.
   Quaker State, founded in 1931 from many small Pennsylvania
refiners and marketing companies, concentrates on the sale of
high-quality motor oil and petrolum byproducts.
   It has about 6,300 employees, including about 450 at its
headquarters and research centers in this Venango County oil center
of about 13,500 people. It also has refineries in Farmers Valley,
McKean County, and in Newell, W.Va.
   Its Truck Lite Inc. subsidiary, based in Jamestown, N.Y.,
manufactures vehicle lighting systems.
   Last year, Quaker State reported a net loss of about $48
million, or $1.82 per common share, on sales of about $848 million,
according to Faulkner.
   Ardshiel said it has been involved in more than a dozen
leveraged buyouts since 1977. In 1986, it was involved in the $1.6
billion leveraged buyout of National Car Rental System Inc. from
Household International Inc.

<HEAD>Investor Leads Buyout of Metropolitan Broadcasting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group led by New York communications investor
Robert F.X. Sillerman said Friday it had agreed to buy Metropolitan
Broadcasting Holding Co., which owns seven radio stations and the
Texas State Radio Network.
   Sillerman said his group will pay about $40 million to the
owners of the privately-held broadcasting concern and will assume
about $260 million in debt. ``Metropolitan Broadcasting is a
premier radio group,'' Sillerman said. ``We believe our financial
resources and strong broadcast operating expertise will provide
Metropolitan with a solid foundation for renewed growth.''
   The sale is subject to approval by the Federal Communications
Commission.
   Metropolitan Broadcasting was created in November 1986 when a
group that included the investment firm Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.
and managers of Metromedia Co.'s radio division bought the division
for $285 million in a leveraged buyout.
   In a leveraged buyout, the buyers often borrow heavily against
the assets or cash flow of the company being acquired to make the
purchase.
   Metropolitan originally included nine radio stations and the
Texas radio network, but sold two stations in Washington and
Philadelphia last fall.
   Dennis McAlpine, a media industry analyst for the investment
firm Oppenheimer & Co., said the stations were sold to help meet
the heavy interest costs associated with the debt incurred in the
buyout.
   Metropolitan currently owns WNEW-AM and WNEW-FM in New York,
WMMR-FM in Philadelphia, KTWV-FM in Los Angeles, WWBA-FM in the
Tampa-St. Petersburg area in Florida, WOMC-FM in Detroit, KRLD-AM
in Dallas, and the Texas State Radio Network, which provides
programming to radio stations in that state.
   Sillerman said his company would cancel Metropolitan's announced
plan to sell WNEW-AM and would review Metropolitan's proposed sale
of WWBA-FM.
   But he said the previously-announced sale of WOMC-FM in Detroit
would go forward, pending FCC approval.
   Metropolitan Broadcasting is being acquired by Sillerman
Acquisition Corp., which was formed for the purpose of buying the
radio properties.
   Sillerman is chairman and chief executive of that company, as
well as of Sillerman-Magee Communications Management Corp., a New
York-based communications investment concern.
   In addition, Sillerman and his associates are the largest
shareholders in Legacy Broadcasting, which owns and operates 10
radio stations in Los Angeles, Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul,
Detroit, Denver and Washington, D.C.
   Sillerman said the Metropolitan stations had been profitable and
were not for sale when he began conversations about the acquisition
only nine days ago.
   He said the stations should be able to generate more profit and
revenue through additional investment in more aggressive promotion.
He said his group's purchase should also end speculation about
whether more of the group's stations would be sold.
   He said Metropolitan's corporate and station management would
remain ``substantially intact.''
   Carl C. Brazell Jr., president of Metropolitan Broadcasting,
said, ``We look forward to building on strong expected results and
to an era of expansion and enhanced profitability for Metropolitan
Broadcasting.''

<HEAD>Eastern Files Brief in Appeal of Court Ruling on Shuttle Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines on Friday filed an opening brief
in its appeal of a U.S. District Court decision that blocked the
sale of the profitable Eastern Air Shuttle to a subsidiary of Texas
Air Corp.
   The appeal will be heard May 5.
   In its brief, the airline said the court ruling was wrong
because the air shuttle sale was a managerial move that didn't
violate collective bargaining agreements.
   Eastern said the court's decision denied the company $225
million the sale would have brought and permitted the court to
assume potentially unlimited oversight authority over the airline's
affairs, threatening its ability to manage its finances.
   The company also said the ruling gave the Machinists union
reason to delay negotiating a contract.
   Eastern said the shuttle sale involved no involuntary employee
transfers and would not cause any Eastern workers to lose
employment rights.
   U.S. District Judge John Pratt in Washington declared March 10
that Eastern was in contempt of court for trying to sell the
shuttle.
   Pratt said Texas Air, Eastern's parent company, broke federal
labor law when it arranged to sell the shuttle. He also said the
sale violated an order he issued last July barring Eastern from
transferring 6,000 ground workers into a new subsidiary called
Airport Ground Services.

<HEAD>Disney Scraps Plan for $300 Million Burbank Entertainment Complex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER GILLOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an unexpected move, the Walt Disney
Co. scrapped plans Friday for $300 million entertainment complex in
Burbank, and city officials indicated they were looking at other
alternatives including a proposal by Disney rival MCA Inc.
   In a two-page letter to the head of Burbank's redevelopment
agency, Robert Ovrom, Disney said the project wasn't justifiable
economically.
   Based on projected costs and attendance at the planned complex,
``the projected return on Disney's investment simply did not meet
corporate thresholds for an investment of this magnitude and
anticipated business risk,'' the company said.
   Disney spokesman Erwin Okun declined to elaborate on what that
profit threshold is.
   Last May, Disney entered into an agreement with Burbank to
negotiate exclusively to develop 40 acresof city-owned land
alongside the Golden State Freeway, about 15 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles.
   Since then, Disney said, the company has invested 22,000
man-hours and spent $2.5 million on planning studies, market
research and related economic analyses.
   The complex was envisioned as including movie backlot tours,
theaters, shopping areas, a hotel, a planetarium, rides and
nightclubs _ a different format that the company's Disneyland theme
park in Anaheim, about 30 miles away in neighboring Orange County.
   The complex was to be about two miles from Disney's crowded
studio and headquarters in Burbank.
   The exclusivity of the negotiating agreement was attacked by
rival entertainment conglomerate MCA Inc., the parent of Universal
Studios and operator of a successful studio backlot tour in nearby
Universal City.
   MCA claimed it had been unfairly barred from making a competing
proposal to develop the Burbank site and has filed suit to block
the Disney-Burbank agreement.
   Ovrom, Burbank's redevelopment chief, said in a three-page
memorandum to the mayor and city council that he felt ``a
tremendous amount of disappointment'' over Disney's decision.
   But he added, ``We are all big boys and big girls, and we know
going into this agreement that it was just a feasibility study ...
We, too, shall immediately shift gears.''
   Ovrom noted that MCA, in its lawsuit, had indicated it was
interested in making a proposal for developing the Burbank site.
   ``I am sure we all anxiously await to see what they will submit
now that Disney is no longer in the picture,'' Ovrom said in the
memorandum.
   MCA spokesman Harold Haas said the company had no comment on its
plans.
   Ovrom said he had no regrets about granting Disney the exclusive
agreement.
   ``The concept that (Disney chairman and chief executive) Michael
Eisner originally envisioned was very exciting and could have been
very special for Burbank,'' Ovrom said in the memo.
   ``Had we turned down Disney's offer to study these
possibilities, we would have gone to our graves always wondering
what might have been.''
