   Honduran troops on Wednesday
surrounded about 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers who entered the country
chasing Contra rebels, military intelligence sources told The
Associated Press.
   They said the Sandinista troops had crossed about 3 miles into
the Honduran border province of Olancho, east of the capital of
Tegucigalpa, and had remained in the area for 24 hours.
   One official, who asked not to be identified, said the
Nicaraguan troops ``have been surrounded by our army ... and we are
only waiting superior orders to enter into action.''
   ``There really is tension and there is crisis, however we are
acting with prudence but with strength in these affairs, and we
hope that everything will stabilize in the next two days,'' he said.
   The Honduran military went on alert, the sources said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras said that Honduras'
president, Jose Azcono Hoyo, contacted Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega to demand the withdrawal of the troops.
   Ortega has not confirmed the presence of Sandinista soldiers in
Honduras, and the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry has denied any
incursion.
   In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
United States was dispatching 3,200 soldiers to southern Honduras
to carry out training exercises and to be ``a signal to the
governments and the people of Central America.'' He said they would
not enter any combat zones.
   Earlier, Fitzwater said Azcona had asked the United States for
help in dealing with an invasion.
   Intelligence officials said the Sandinista troops apparently
entered Honduras to destroy a base camp of the U.S.-backed Contras.
   ``We have done everything possible to avoid a confrontation that
would drastically affect ... both countries,'' one source said.
   The Superior Council of the Armed Forces, the country's highest
military body, was in session most of the day, the officials said.
Earlier Wednesday, Azcona met for about six hours behind closed
doors to discuss the situation with top officials and the armed
forces military chiefs.
   Lopez Contreras told reporters at a news conference that the
military command was reviewing battle plans in case the Sandinista
forces continued occupying Honduran territory.
   In Managua, Ortega refused to confirm or deny that Nicaraguan
troops had encroached on Honduran soil.
   Lopez Contreras did not comment on reports that the Reagan
administration was dispatching U.S. troops to Honduras.
   ``We don't want to create a national panic. We only ask our
compatriots to have confidence in the government and in the armed
forces,'' he said.
   The foreign minister added that Azcona had demanded that Ortega
order the ``withdrawal of the troops because they are raising
tensions and producing insecurity in the border.''
   Azcona also asked presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador and
Guatemala to appeal to Ortega ``to abstain from bringing about
aggressive military actions against Honduras,'' Lopez Contreras
said.
   ``The government and the army are ready to put into action the
right of legitimate defense,'' the foreign minister declared.
   Military intelligence sources said that at least 2,000
Sandinista troops were inside Honduras and that another 4,500 were
near the border in the Bocay region.

   A man who fired guns and
grenades from behind a tombstone killed three people and wounded 68
at an IRA graveside service Wednesday before enraged mourners
cornered and beat him.
   Young Catholics rioted in the streets afterward.
   Belfast police arrested the gunman at the end of a wild chase
over graves in the Milltown Roman Catholic cemetery during which he
hurled grenades at the pursuing mourners and fired until his gun
jammed. They identified him as Michael Stone, a Protestant, but
gave no other information about him.
   Thousands of mourners screamed and dived for cover when shots
shattered the silence of the cemetery in early afternoon, as the
coffins of three unarmed IRA members killed by British soldiers in
Gibraltar were being lowered into a single grave.
   A companion of the attacker fled in a van parked nearby, and
police said they captured him in another part of the city. Both men
can be held without charge for seven days. Police provided no
details on the second man.
   Mainstream Protestant organizations disavowed the attack. The
Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Protestant Democratic Unionist
Party, said all ``right-thinking Protestants'' would condemn the
attack ``without any ambivalence whatsoever.''
   The British Broadcasting Corp. in Belfast said an anonymous
caller claimed responsibility Wednesday night on behalf of the
Protestant Action Force, but gave no recognized codeword to
establish authenticity of the claim.
   The little-known extremist group has claimed responsibility for
numerous sectarian assassinations.
   Catholic youths ignored government and church appeals after the
attack and rioted through the evening. They burned hijacked buses
and other vehicles and blocked streets with flaming barricades.
   Palls of smoke hung over the Catholic ghettos of West Belfast.
   Police said they fired plastic bullets at rioters who fired a
shot and threw stones at a police patrol in the Ardoyne district of
west Belfast. In Londonderry, the province's second city, one car
was hijacked and set ablaze in the Catholic Bogside district.
   Police identified the three people killed Wednesday as Thomas
Charles McErlean, 20; John Murray, 26; and Kevin Brady, 30. All
came from Catholic areas of Belfast.
   One of those wounded at the cemetery was in critical condition
and four were in seriously wounded, said a spokesman for Royal
Victoria Hospital. Most victims were shot or hit by shrapnel while
scrambling for cover during the melee, which lasted about five
minutes.
   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, blamed Protestant paramilitary groups and accused
Britain of collusion.
   In London, aides of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she
was ``shocked and appalled.''
   Her government denounced the attack as ``insane and depraved.''
It appealed for calm, as did Sinn Fein, church leaders and the
Irish Republic government in Dublin.
   Police, the British government and the Ulster Defense
Association, an umbrella organization of Protestant vigilante
groups, and the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters denied involvement.
   The largely Catholic IRA is waging a guerrilla war to drive the
British from Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, and Protestant
paramilitary groups have grown up to fight it.
   Martin McGuinness, vice president of Sinn Fein, said: ``It's
obvious it was an attack by Loyalist (Protestant) movements.''
   Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said: ``There was collusion
between elements with the British Crown forces, probably the Royal
Ulster Constabulary (provincial police).''
   Police said they deliberately kept away from the funeral because
of assurances that the IRA would not turn it into a paramilitary
display.
   Commandos in civilian clothes killed the guerrillas, Mairead
Farrell, 31; Sean Savage, 24, and Daniel McCann, 30, on March 6.
British officials said the three were on a mission to bomb a
military ceremony at the colony.
   Mourners were lowering Miss Farrell's flag-draped coffin into
the grave when a bearded man opened fire 15 yards away from behind
a gravestone.
   Young men yelled ``There he is! There he is!'' and the thickset
gunman bolted.
   His cap fell off as he reloaded his pistol, and still dodging
and weaving, he fired at the youths and hurled two grenades while
taunting the pursuers to keep coming, witnesses said.
   ``I saw a young man throwing things from the back of the
mourners,'' said the Rev. Alec Reid, who was saying prayers beside
the open grave. ``I thought they were stones, but it looks as if
they were grenades. He was also firing shots into the crowd. There
was absolute chaos.''
   Adams said the two men involved in the attack entered the
cemetery carrying bags and cameras and were mistaken for
journalists.
   The attack occurred after moderate Andy Tyrie was ousted as
leader of the Ulster Defense Association. Hardliners accused him of
weakening the armed fight against the IRA.
   More than 2,600 people have been killed in Northern Ireland's
sectarian violence since August 1969.

<HEAD>Window Nearly Mistaken As Trash Identified As A Tiffany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 9-foot-tall stained glass window that
was headed for the trash heap after being found in a church garage
here was made by Louis Tiffany, an expert says.
   ``There's no question in my mind whatsoever that it's Tiffany,''
said Dan Oppenheimer, who owns a stained glass studio in Memphis
and is the author of numerous published articles about the craft.
``It's a glorious find.''
   The window depicts the figure of Jesus and features examples of
drapery glass, a technique unique to Tiffany about 1905 when the
piece was made, Oppenheimer said.
   He said the window's intricate leading and the plating of glass
in multiple layers caused him to suspect right away it was by
Tiffany, who lived from 1848 to 1933 and was America's most famous
stained glass artisan.
   The window, which measures 4{-by-9 feet, was found last week in
a packing crate in a garage at Grace St. Luke's Episcopal Church,
Oppenheimer said.
   ``The maintenance people were going to throw it out. They
thought it was a crate of broken glass,'' he said.
   Oppenheimer said the value of the window has not been
determined, but another Tiffany window at the church was appraised
10 years ago at $132,000.
   In 1977, Oppenheimer identified three of the church's windows as
Tiffany's and his findings were confirmed by Sotheby Parke Bernet,
the art auction house.
   Oppenheimer said the crate with the newly discovered window
apparently was stored in the church basement in the 1960s but was
moved recently to the garage.
   He said the window is probably one of seven commissioned by the
Grace Episcopal Church, which merged with St. Luke's Church in 1944.
   Tiffany Co. records document at least three installations at
Grace Church and Sotheby's vouches for three others. All six
windows are at Grace St. Luke's.
   Oppenheimer said the newly discovered window is apparently the
seventh work commissioned from Tiffany.
   ``There are certain earmarks you look for, including the glass
itself,'' he said. ``When you find all of them in one panel and it
comes from a church that has a history of commissioning stained
glass from Tiffany, you just have to take a leap of faith and
pronounce it Tiffany.''

   Oklahoma officials say a vacation in their
state is more than OK, and they hope a road campaign in South Texas
will persuade ``snowbirds'' to stop by on their way back north this
spring.
   State and private tourism supporters opened up a two-day travel
show in this lower Rio Grande Valley city Tuesday, hoping to reach
the thousands of retired Midwesterners and Canadians who spend
winter in the area.
   ``You have to try pretty hard coming to South Texas not to go
through Oklahoma,'' Oklahoma Lt. Gov. Robert S. Kerr III, who
traveled to McAllen.
   A tourism survey, however, showed that ``Oklahoma doesn't have
much of an image,'' Kerr said.
   The state has launched a $1.2 million tourism promotion
campaign, said Eugene Dilbeck, director of the Oklahoma Tourism and
Recreation Department.
   State officials project they will get a five-fold return on
their promotional investment.

<HEAD>Miss America Addressing Critical Needs Of Nursing Profession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unlike Miss Americas of recent years,
Kaye Lani Rae Rafko is not looking for movie contracts or modeling
jobs after her reign ends.
   Instead, she is anxious to return to her job as a registered
nurse at a hospital in Toledo, Ohio, working with terminally ill
cancer and AIDS patients.
   ``After another six months of this, I'll be ready to hang up the
heels and the tiara and head back to work,'' she told nurses
Tuesday while visiting hospitals here.
   The 24-year-old former Miss Michigan is using her reign to
maximize the image of her career, however, promoting the nursing
profession rather than snipping ribbons to open new shopping malls
or shaking hands at state fairs.
   The first months of Miss Rafko's reign, which began in
September, were booked with appearances for the pageant's six
sponsors, said pageant executive director Leonard Horn.
   ``But once people saw that Kaye Lani was a nurse, we cleared her
schedule to make room for more public service appearances,'' said
Horn, in his first year as head of the pageant.
   ``This is what I want Miss America to do more of anyway _ less
commercial appearances and more living up to the role model that
she really is.''
   Miss Rafko has visited numerous hospitals and hospices and
spoken to many nursing associations and medical groups. She has
done a public service announcement for the nursing profession and
appeared on the cover of a nursing trade journal.
   Horn said that Miss Rafko's career fits in perfectly with public
service appearances, acknowledging that future Miss Americas who
sing or dance for a living might not have as much expertise in
dealing with service-oriented groups.
   ``But we're going to emphasize the fact that any Miss America
has a beneficial interest when she speaks to any number of groups,
whether it's the Future Farmers of America or the American Cancer
Society,'' he said. ``You don't have to be a nurse to speak to
those groups and make an impression. Miss America can make a
difference simply by promoting education.''
   But this year, Miss Rafko is intent on hyping her career.
   ``A main focus of today's American people is health, and
fortunately I know a lot about that,'' she said.
   At least one other Miss America was inundated with special
requests for speaking engagements. Miss America 1984 Vanessa
Williams, the first black Miss America, addressed many black
organizations until she relinquished her crown in a scandal over
nude photographs.
   But most recent Miss Americas have followed a fairly routine
round of promotional appearances.
   ``In the past few years, many Miss Americas have concentrated on
entertainment careers. There's nothing wrong with that,'' Miss
Rafko said. ``Everybody has their own dreams and goals and that's
what the Miss America pageant is all about.''

<TEXT>
   Saying a special investigation uncovered ``a
massive network'' of corruption in city prisons, prosecutors
Tuesday announced charges against seven guards and two inmates and
said there would be more.
   District Attorney Ronald Castille said during a press conference
outside the Philadelphia Detention Center that arrests could reach
into the hundreds before the 18-month investigation known as
``Operation Ferret'' is completed. Officials said the investigation
was prompted by widespread reports of corruption and complaints
within the system.
   ``The investigation will potentially yield the largest number of
arrests related to official misconduct by correctional officers in
this country's history,'' Castille said. He declined to give
specifics.
   The city has five correctional institutions with between 8,500
and 9,000 inmates. The institutions are run by 1,700 employes,
1,400 of them are guards.
   The first charges stemmed from two incidents, an escape from
Laurel Hall minimum security pre-release unit and an aggravated
assault against a prisoner at a downtown YWCA, another pre-release
facility.
   Those named in a grand jury presentment were charged with crimes
ranging from aggravated assault to escape.
   In the Laurel Hill case, guard Dennis Tiest, prison cook Stanley
Suder, and inmate Kenneth Lynch were charged with helping inmate
John Longendorfer escape last July. Longendorfer was serving time
for terroristic threats and indecent assault.
   In the other incident, which occurred Feb. 16, six correctional
officers were charged with an unprovoked assault on inmate William
Kennedy. Kennedy was hospitalized for four days after the attack,
Castille said.
   Castille said the beating was allegedly in retaliation for
Kennedy reporting a guard asleep at his assigned post.
   Those charged were officers Edward Ricks, Sammie Rogers, Clemon
Davis, Christ Taylor, Charles Favano and Sgt. Peter Jones.

   As he stripped and cleaned the AK-47
assault rifle on his desk, Federal Judge Miguel Angel Izaguirre
said he has good reason to try to stop Latin American cocaine from
reaching the streets of the United States.
   ``In 20 years, the youth that is taking all this cocaine will be
running America and influencing Latin America _ with the mentality
of cokeheads,'' he said. ``North America's influence in this region
is tremendous. So we Latin Americans have to try to ensure that
American youth does not take cocaine.''
   The 41-year-old Izaguirre is the federal judge in this Caribbean
coastal town. He also is a weapons buff and student of military
history.
   ``Men, like arms, are proven on the field of battle,'' he said
in an interview in his cramped and cluttered office that also
contained an Uzi submachine gun. ``And this is my field of battle.''
   He has survived two attempts on his life, he said _ one with an
incendiary bomb, the other a machine-gun attack on his home during
which he returned fire with his Soviet-made AK-47.
   ``I love the AK,'' he said. His arsenal of weapons, he
explained, is ``to defend myself against the Medellin Cartel.''
   The Medellin Cartel, named for the city in Colombia where it is
based, is believed responsible for more than 80 percent of the
cocaine smuggled into the United States.
   ``They have tried to bribe me with money, women, airplanes and
yachts,'' he said.
   Leaning against the wall were five segments of hollowed out
Honduran redwood ostensibly intended for assembly into rustic
doors. They are evidence from the biggest drug bust in U.S. history
_ the confiscation in November of four tons of cocaine by U.S.
federal agents in Florida. The drug, shipped from the northern
Honduran coast, was hidden in the hollows.
   ``According to our information, the shipment was 8,000 kilos
(almost 9 tons). So more than half of it got through,'' he said.
   U.S. authorities were greatly concerned when, over the past few
years, Honduras became an increasingly important transshipment
point for Colombian cocaine.
   Izaguirre has been cited as a key man in joint U.S.-Honduran
efforts to reduce the flow.
   The judge said Honduras, with its long and relatively unguarded
coast and scores of clandestine air strips, provided the ideal
midpoint for northbound shipments.
   ``When I came here in June 1987, I found a series of cases, all
of which were being dismissed for lack of evidence. ... Other
judges had certain fears, some got sick, some left,'' he said. But
within two months, he had handed down the first conviction and
prison term for cocaine trafficking in Honduran judicial history.
   He has convicted 10 others on drug charges, and has nearly three
dozen suspected traffickers in jail awaiting judgment. Two major
traffickers based here, the Colombian Luis Guerrero and the
Cuban-American Rafael Gonzalez, were extradited to the United
States after being arraigned by Izaguirre. They are both serving
terms in U.S. prisons.
   Izaguirre said he has given the maximum penalty under Honduran
law to all the drug traffickers he has convicted _ five years in
prison and a 5,000 lempira ($2,500) fine. He complains, however,
that the law is too lenient and would like to see penalties
increased. He said the law provides the same penalties for cocaine
trafficking as it does for marijuana trafficking.
   The judge _ divorced four times and the father of five children
_ carries his weapons with him wherever he goes.
   ``If it befalls me to die in this post, then I'll die, without
the slightest fear,'' he said.
   He keeps a .357 Magnun revolver on his desk within easy reach.
   The judge insists he has no political ambitions, but maintains
contact with a number of the country's political leaders.
   ``I tell them it is imperative that we verify the origin of the
parties' funds. Because if we don't, we're running the grave risk
that the traffickers get their people elected to Congress. Then
they reform the Constitution in their favor, they gut the
anti-narcotics law; they destroy us.''
   Though U.S. authorities have expressed concern that drug money
has corrupted some officers in Honduras' armed forces, Izaguirre
said the cooperation given him by the military has been ``total.''
   He said his interest in the military began when he was 12 years
old, with the reading of Karl von Clausewitz, the 19th century
Prussian general and writer of military strategy.
   ``I was two centimeters (about an inch) too short to get into
the military academy,'' he said. ``But if I had, I'm sure I would
have made general.''

   Rocks smashed through windows
of Bus No. 60, shattering the quiet murmur of Hebrew as Jewish
settlers traveled home on a moonless night.
   Israelis clutching frightened children in their arms ducked
quickly into the aisle. Several men leaped to their feet and fired
shots through two broken windows. In the darkness, the voice of a
young Israeli boy rang out: ``Get the Arabs! Get them!''
   ``Stop the bus!'' shouted another angry Israeli woman.
   The driver, an Israeli Arab, hesitated and then pulled to a
stop. Three Israelis ran from the front of the bus, firing shots,
and two others went out the back door. But it was too late. The
Palestinian stone-throwers had disappeared into the night.
   In a 45-minute period Monday night, Arab attackers heaved stones
through windows of three buses and five cars near this Arab village
on the outskirts of the settlement of Kiryat Arba, about 20 miles
south of Jerusalem. No Arabs were caught.
   Three Israelis were treated for cuts at a nearby hospital, but
there were no serious injuries.
   Jewish settlers say, however, the assaults show this biblical
land is increasingly becoming a battlefield and the Arabs see them
as the target.
   ``Make no mistake. This is war,'' said one woman aboard Bus No.
60, social worker Rachel Klein, 50.
   About 50 settlers, including a dozen children and three infants,
were aboard when the bus was attacked about 9 p.m. Most of the
women wore headscarves and the men wore knitted yarmulkes, the head
caps of observant Jews.
   The red-and-white bus, marked with three Hebrew letters denoting
the Eged civilian bus cooperative, was on a scheduled hour-long run
from Jerusalem to the West Bank town of Hebron. The trip on the
winding narrow road took the settlers past several Arab villages
and refugee camps, including the city of Bethlehem and the Dheishe
refugee camp, which is blocked by a 10-foot-high wire fence to
prevent stone-throwing.
   Settlers retaliated before dawn Tuesday, setting fire to three
Arab-owned cars in Halhoul and breaking the windows of several
others, said Yossi Dayan, president of a newly formed Kiryat Arba
security committee.
   Dayan said a rising number of settlers who previously were
inactive are being driven to fight back by the nearly nightly
attacks, even if it means breaking Israeli law.
   The latest leaflet signed by the Palestine Liberation
Organization and distributed in the West Bank and Gaza ordered
Arabs to step up their fight against ``the occupation (and) its
settlers.''
   Arabs have not only thrown stones and firebombs at Israeli
vehicles, but also defiantly hang the outlawed Palestinian banner
from utility poles along roads used by settlers. The nationalist
symbol acts like a red flag for many Israelis.
   ``They don't have the same rights in this country as we do,''
said the London-born Mrs. Klein, who has lived 13 years in Kiryat
Arba. ``How can we let them make us cower in fear on our own buses
in our own country?
   ``Our government is diddling and afraid to take strong action,''
she said. ``But the Arabs only understand a clear message. We
should give them one.''
   Some settlers already have tried to send a message, damaging
Arab-owned cars, carrying out patrols along West Bank roads and
sometimes firing shots at Palestinians.
   Settlers are blamed for killing seven of the Arabs who have died
during the 14-week uprising.
   But, Dayan warned: ``If the army doesn't move to stop acts of
violence against us, we are going to take far more serious steps.
We are discussing setting up some kind of _ I don't want to call
them militias _ but some kind of patrols.''
   The army maintains an around-the-clock presence in the West
Bank. But fewer soldiers are in evidence now than a month ago, and
the settlers complain that even when troops are on the scene, they
are prevented by defense ministry policy from adequately
retaliating against the Arabs.
   ``Many people in Kiryat Arba prefer if the army doesn't come,
because then they can respond in their own way,'' said Baruch
Goldstein, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-born settler and also a member of the
security committee.
   ``Kiryat Arba is breaking into two groups. One is of people who
are frightened, tend to ride the buses less and will eventually
leave,'' Goldstein said. ``The other, larger group will stay and,
sooner or later, take its own action to stop the violence.''
   Goldstein, a 31-year-old doctor who specializes in trauma cases,
said about four times as many vehicles traveling between Jerusalem
and Kiryat Arba were stoned in the first three months of this year,
compared with the first three months of 1987.
   On Sunday, a 12-year-old girl from Kiryat Arba was struck on the
face by a stone as she traveled on a bus to school. Her nose was
broken, her teeth chipped and her upper lip cut, said Goldstein,
who treated her.
   ``People know it is against the law for them to act against the
Arabs and they will be arrested if they do,'' he said. ``But as the
violence against us increases, people are deciding they don't have
too much to lose. They are realizing coexistence with the Arabs is
an impossibility.''

   Pat Robertson met with the Republican national
chairman Tuesday to discuss his faltering presidential bid and said
later he is ``laying the foundation'' for 1992.
   Robertson suffered another disappointing showing in Illinois,
collecting just 7 percent in Tuesday's primary. Though he insisted
he will remain in the 1988 race, Robertson appeared to be looking
ahead.
   ``I am laying the foundation now and definitely talking to
people about 1992. I will play a major role in the GOP,'' he told
reporters at his headquarters in Chesapeake, Va.
   Robertson also talked with reporters after his meeting with
Republican National Committee Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf. He said he
is approaching the $27 million limit that candidates are allowed to
spend in the primary season. He said he is laying off staff and
will be forced to discontinue the big spending that has
characterized his campaign so far.
   ``I am bumping up against the limit. ... I have enough money to
keep in the race through California and the convention. But I don't
have enough to do telemarketing and television,'' he said. ``My own
personal travel will continue but as far as a full-blown media
campaign I can't afford that any more.''
   Election law restricts spending by presidential candidates who
accept federal matching funds for their campaigns.
   The meeting with Fahrenkopf took place at Robertson's request, a
party spokeswoman said.
   Robertson said, ``We were discussing arrangements for the
convention in August and also discussing ways where I could help
Republicans gain control of key state legislatures, for instance
the legislature of California, so that we could achieve
redistricting of a fair basis in the early 1990s and use that as a
basis to gain control of the House of Representatives and the
United States Senate for the Republican Party.''
   RNC spokeswoman Kathryn Murray confirmed the meeting had focused
on those two topics at the suggestion of Robertson.
   She said Robertson expressed a wish to campaign on behalf of
Republican candidates at all levels. Fahrenkopf ``welcomes his
support,'' she said.
   ``As long as he can continue to bring new voters into the
Republican Party, that's a positive,'' Murray said.
   Robertson also met Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir who was in Washington for talks with U.S. officials.
   Robertson said he and Shamir were ``old friends.'' The Christian
Broadcasting Network that Robertson founded broadcasts in the
Middle East.
   Robertson endorsed Shamir's stance against giving up Israeli
occupied lands to the Palestinian people until after ``a period of
Palestinian self rule.''
   ``Any surrender of territory in the near future would seriously
imperil the ability of Israel to defend itself,'' he said, adding
that he supports negotiations among the Israelis, Jordan and
Palestinians.
   On politics, he was pressed to explain how he could continue
campaigning without spending money. Robertson said that in Illinois
he spent only $20,000.
   ``I have tens of thousands of volunteers who are working
ceaselessly night and day because they care for a cause, they care
for principle,'' he said. ``Its a movement to bring about
conservative principles in America.''

   A viewer never knows exactly what to expect from
the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company but it's almost certain to be
interesting. Tuesday's opening night of a two-week season presented
two very different premieres and a masterpiece from 1986,
``Concerto Six Twenty-Two.''
   The opening, which attracted a formal-dress audience to the City
Center, marks the 20th anniversary of Lubovitch's founding his own
modern dance company to dance his choreography.
   ``Musette,'' the premiere ending the evening, is set to
Poulenc's ``Concerto for Two Pianos.'' Lubovitch has six couples
follow the music's moods, which often change. He doesn't repeat
himself.
   Early in the dance, though in bare feet, the dancers assume the
leg and foot positions of ballet. Lubovitch has, as he usually
does, a time for humor. One man's solo ends, to his apparent
surprise, when two men pick him up and carry him off stage. At one
time, half the dancers stand still, while the rest dance in and out
among them like skiers going around poles.
   When the music becomes lyrical, the men lift and carry the women
so their colorful tulle skirts look like big candy canes going by.
There is a section that looks like court dancing and one that looks
like trained dancers' variations of America's folk version of court
dancing, the reel. A romantic section of music has two men picking
up one woman between them and gracefully swinging her. ``Musette''
ends most satisfactorily with a courtly bow.
   ``Of My Soul,'' to a Bach ``Cantata,'' was danced at Avery
Fisher Hall last summer at the Mostly Mozart Festival. The company
considers this the ``official'' premiere. Lubovitch incorporated
some American sign language into the arm movements. It's an
arresting idea which doesn't come off brilliantly.
   Some of the arm movements translate what four people are singing
in the orchestra pit. Lubovitch has made them flow in and out of
expansive arm reaches. That works but the whole thing doesn't seem
to arise from the music like the evening's other two dances.
   ``Concerto Six Twenty-Two,'' premiered at Carnegie Hall in 1986,
is danced to Mozart's ``Concerto for Clarinet and Orchestra.'' The
dancers, wearing white, in the first and third movements, looked
inspired and fresh. The middle movement, danced by Sylvain
Lafortune and Rick Michalek, remains one of dance's most moving and
dignified duets. In such simple things as one man leaning back
against the other's hand, it shows human support and trust.
   The Solisti New York Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Ransom
Wilson, did a beautiful job with the Mozart and Bach music. The
Poulenc music was a recording.

drink to satisfy an attractive apartment neighbor won three awards
in an international competition for television and radio
commercials.
   The TV commercial for Diet Pepsi was named sweepstakes winner,
world's best live action 60-second English-language commercial and
best humorous commercial at Tuesday's 28th International
Broadcasting Awards dinner.
   A series of three commercials for Wine World was the radio
sweepstakes winner. It also won the series trophy.
   The annual competition sponsored by the Hollywood Radio and
Television Society attracted more than 5,000 entries from 60
countries.
   Radio personalities Casey Kasem and Gary Owens were masters of
ceremonies at the black-tie presentations at the Century Plaza
Hotel attended by an estimated 1,500 advertising and broadcasting
executives from around the world.
   The society also honored Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, Betty White
and Estelle Getty of NBC's ``The Golden Girls'' as international

   Actress Lillian Gish has donated
$10,000 to Bowling Green State University to enhance the film
theater that bears her family's name.
   The gift is designated for the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Film
Theater endowment fund, which supports activities in the building
that commemorates the Gish sisters' contributions to the performing
arts.
   The theater, dedicated in 1976, showcases the art of film by
offering regular showings of classic movies.
   The theater is undergoing a $250,000 renovation of its seating,
projection facilities, and gallery. The renovation is scheduled to
be completed in May 1989.
   Ms. Gish also donated $10,000 in 1986 to advance and support the
study of film at Bowling Green.
   Ms. Gish, 91, was born in Ohio and made her acting debut at the
turn of the century in the village of Rising Sun, about 20 miles
from Bowling Green.

   The TV personality who calls himself The
Amazing Kreskin looked into the future of entertainment and
predicted that dinner theaters next season will offer more than
just musicals.
   Future dinner theaters will resemble the supper clubs of the
1940s with plush decor, outstanding meals and a wider variety of
entertainment, Kreskin said Tuesday in a speech to the annual
convention of the National Dinner Theater Association.
   Because television is offering a wider choice of entertainment,
``to survive in the next decade, you must offer more than the same
old buffet and musical,'' he said.
   He said concerts, discos and festivals also have changed
theatergoers' tastes. ``They want to participate in the
entertainment rather than just sitting and watching a production.''
   While Kreskin made it clear he was available for such
engagements, Richard Aikins, theatrical producer and chairman of
the convention, said he thought Kreskin's view was valid.
   Kreskin, a 53-year-old self-styled ``mentalist,'' has performed
extrasensory feats on his own syndicated TV show and in dozens of
talk-show appearances.

   Musicians from 10 Western countries including
David Bowie, Jennifer Rush and Irish rockers U-2 have agreed to
perform along with Soviet musicians in benefit concerts next month
to fight drug addiction.
   The official Novosti Press Agency said other foreign performers
scheduled are Level 42, Supertramp, Foreigner, Tangerine Dream and
Bon Jovi.
   Participating Soviet groups are Aquarium, Bravo, Brigade S,
Black Coffee and others whose music ranges from heavy metal to
traditional rock 'n' roll, Novosti said.
   The press agency did not give a date, but said the three
six-hour concerts will be held in late April at the 30,000-seat
Olympic Stadium in Moscow.
   Sources close to the organizers said the concerts were postponed
from this month because of bureaucratic red tape.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said former
Beatles George Harrison and Paul McCartney, as well as Julian
Lennon, son of the late Beatle John Lennon, had been invited. It
was unclear whether they would participate.
   The press agency said revenue from tickets costing about $16

   Laryngitis caused Nancy Reagan to cancel a
trip today to a Nashville, Tenn., school that a snowstorm had
prevented her from visiting once before.
   ``She can't talk. It's a bad case of laryngitis,'' spokeswoman
Wendy Weber Toler said Tuesday. ``She started losing her voice last
night.''
   Mrs. Toler said the White House physician, Dr. John Hutton, had
advised the first lady not to travel.
   It was the second time the first lady had been forced to cancel
the visit to Warner Elementary School and a drug and alcohol abuse
prevention program; a snowstorm had prevented Mrs. Reagan from
visiting the city the first time.

   Jeb Stuart Magruder, a former White House
aide who served seven months in prison for his role in the
Watergate coverup, says he's well prepared to head the mayor's
commission on values and ethics.
   ``I talk about these issues to the Kiwanises and the Rotaries
around here, as well as deal with these issues through the church,
so I would hope that my background would be helpful,'' Magruder
said Tuesday.
   After his release from prison in 1976, Magruder entered a
seminary and was ordained in 1981 as a Presbyterian minister.
   Mayor Dana Rinehart appointed the 15-member volunteer
commission, on which he also will sit, as part of the city's
response to an incident last year in which passersby made off with
bags of money that fell from an armored truck on a freeway.
   Magruder, President Nixon's deputy director of communications at
the time of the 1972 Watergate break-in, pleaded guilty to perjury
and conspiracy to obstruct justice.

<HEAD>NASA Panel Says It Can Show CFC Effects On Ozone</HEAD>

   The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration says the ozone shield is in fact thinning measurably
due to chlorofluorocarbon compounds.
   A NASA panel said the shield thinned out by about 2.3 percent
over a 17-year period ending in 1986 in the temperate zones of the
Northern Hemisphere. The panel said the shield thinned by 0.5
percent to 1.8 percent over nine years ending in 1987 in the
tropics and part of the temperate zones of both hemispheres.
   This means increased skin cancer around the world, largely
unknown effects on fish and wildlife and increased pressure from
environmentalists to go beyond the treaty approved by the Senate to
cut emissions of ozone-destroying chemicals.
   Chlorofluorocarbons are used as refrigeration fluids, cleaning
solvents and plastic foam blowing agents.
   ``At this point there is no other culprit to blame,'' panel
member Sherwood Rowland of the University of California at Irvine
said Tuesday. ``We have taken out all the natural phenomena that
are believed to affect ozone.''
   A massive 17-month effort by more than 100 scientists convened
by NASA went through practically every ozone observation made in
recent years, trying to correct for instrument errors and drift and
to remove the effects of the 11-year solar cycle and the biennial
oscillation of high-altitude winds.
   Since 1985, there have been several reports of ozone decline
worldwide in addition to the well-established ozone ``hole'' over
Antarctica _ a 50 percent decline in springtime, followed by
recovery.
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee M. Thomas said
the report ``will certainly be a part of the 1990 assessment''
called for in the treaty. ``The crucial first step, however, is
speedy international ratification,'' he said.
   But Sen. Robert T. Stafford, R-Vt., said, ``The nations of the
world should immediately reconvene to consider amendments'' to the
treaty, and the United States should resume its advocacy of a
complete ban. ``We've got to make deeper cuts in CFC emissions,''
said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
   Kevin Fay, executive director of the Alliance for a Responsible
CFC Policy, a group of producers and users, said the 1990 schedule
``is the framework to be followed'' because unilateral reductions
won't help.
   The Senate voted 83-0 on Monday to approve a 31-nation treaty
calling for 50 percent cuts by 1998 in production of
chlorofluorocarbons.
   Noting that CFC compounds over Antarctica now were released at
ground level about 10 years ago and that the Antarctic hole could
last 100 years even if the treaty is followed, Rowland said,
``There's plenty of reason to re-open the ... protocol.''
   Ozone at high altitudes makes life on earth possible by blocking
the harmful ultraviolet rays. The EPA estimates that each percent
decrease in ozone means a 4.8 percent to 7.5 percent increase in
non-melanoma skin cancer and a 0.8 percent to 1.5 percent increase
in the more deadly melanoma form.
   Considering the incidence and death rates of both forms, this
would mean 280 to 455 deaths per year on top of the 10,000 from
skin cancer in the United States, or 640 to 1,050 deaths if a 2.3
percent decline were uniform across the country.
   The 2.3 percent is not uniform. NASA presented its 1969-1986
Northern Hemisphere estimates from ground obserations as averages
over each of three bands: 30 degrees latitude (about the latitude
of Houston, Cairo and Shanghai) to 40 degrees (Philadelphia and
Madrid), down 1.7 percent; 40 degrees to 53 degrees (Edmonton,
Alberta, and Berlin), down 3.0 percent; and 53 degrees to 64
degrees (Fairbanks, Alaska, and Reykjavik, Iceland), down 2.3
percent.
   No single estimate was presented for all three bands, but
Rowland said the average, a 2.3 percent decline, would be close.
All the estimates have substantial uncertainty about them. Each of
the three band estimates has a 68 percent chance of being plus or
minus 1.0 percentage point, at most, away from the number given.
   Corrected satellite data show an ozone decline of about 2.5
percent in the band running from 53 degrees north to 53 degrees
south from 1978 through 1987. But 0.7 percent to 2.0 percent of
this results from the solar cycle, the report said.

   Officials in Natchez say they'll
reluctantly permit a white supremacist protest march against a
14-week-old black boycott of white-owned businesses in exchange for
dismissal of a lawsuit against the city.
   U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour announced the settlement
Tuesday in dismissing a lawsuit filed by Jackson attorney Richard
Barrett on behalf of The Nationalist Movement. The judge also
ordered Natchez to pay Barrett's attorneys' fees in the case.
   ``The law of the land will prevail in Natchez, not the law of
the jungle,'' Barrett said after the announcement. ``This is a
victory for the red-white-and-blue people _ meaning red-neck, white
skin and blue collar.''
   Boycott leaders are seeking, among other things, a black school
superintendent and more black teachers in the Adams County-Natchez
school district.
   ``I'm opposed to Richard Barrett and his movement, but as mayor
of the city, you have to abide the by the laws and the courts. We
just hope nobody will show up for it,'' Natchez Mayor Tony Byrne
said of the march.
   Byrne said officials decided to settle after the County Board of
Supervisors said the city couldn't ban the rally scheduled for the
county courthouse grounds Saturday afternoon, the day Barrett was
seeking permission for the parade through city streets.
   Barrett had contended in his lawsuit that the city was
infringing on the group's constitutional rights by retroactively
applying a parade ordinance adopted March 8.
   ``We'll see to it that Mr. Barrett comes to town, has his parade
and rally, and leaves town as expeditiously as possible,'' Byrne
said.

<HEAD>U.S. Government Agency Would Buy Shares In Business Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years ago the Reagan administration
proposed selling its Overseas Private Investment Corp. to private
interests. Now it's urging that the government agency be allowed to
buy shares in private companies.
   Craig A. Nalen, OPIC's president for more than seven years, told
the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on economic policy on
Tuesday that the agency wants to begin a pilot project that would
put $10 million over the next five years into black Africa and the
Caribbean.
   The money would be spent to take up as much as 30 percent of the
shares in new American companies there. Government bodies in Japan,
West Germany, Britain and the Netherlands already help their
private investors in this way.
   OPIC's main job is to sell insurance to American investors
overseas, against what are called political risks: war, rebellion,
civil strife, confiscation and official freezing of assets. It is
one of the few federal agencies that makes money: $300 million over
the past three years, Nalen said.
   ``OPIC's strong financial position makes the agency a good
candidate for privatization,'' said the president's budget proposal
for the year that ended last September.
   There was considerable opposition to the idea, both inside and
outside the agency, on grounds the insurance was sought precisely
because it had the power of the U.S. government behind it. After
some study, the president's Office of Management and Budget decided
that OPIC had better stay part of the government.
   The privatization plan was quietly dropped.
   OPIC also makes loans to U.S. companies setting up business in
other countries _ $202.8 million worth of loans and guarantees last
year.
   Nalen said Tuesday that buying shares as well as making loans
would help small projects get started.
   It would allow these heavily indebted countries to borrow less
for industrial development, he said. Many are unable to borrow
because banks have cut back their lending he said.
   Nalen also argued that direct investment by his agency would
help U.S. investors.
   ``OPIC's major ... counterparts all have the ability to invest
equity, thus providing their clients with a significant advantage
over their U.S. competitors,'' he said in his prepared testimony.

<HEAD>Students Venture Where the IRS Fears to Tread: Into Simplicity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If your idea of a good tax form is one with
short sentences and short words, take heart.
   A group of students, venturing where government has been less
than successful, vows to come up with a series of tax forms that
are understandable even to the high school dropout. And the
students say they will finish the job within less than six months.
   ``I don't say it's a simple task, but we're going to try,''
Professor Nicholas J. Creme, director of the Center for Taxation
Studies in the Akron University School of Law, said in an interview
Tuesday.
   He said he wants the students to work with the Internal Revenue
Service on the project, although the IRS has not yet embraced the
idea.
   The students' interest was piqued by what they learned while
representing low-income taxpayers in audits, collections and other
actions involving the IRS. They learned that on the average, only
11 percent of taxpayers with less than a high school education have
the reading skills to comprehend instructions for filling out Forms
1040 or 1040EZ.
   The students concluded that if taxpayers can't understand how to
comply with the tax laws, they probably won't. Or as Creme, a tax
lawyer for 20 years, put it, ``When people can't figure out the
right answer, they will take the answer that gives them the best
break.''
   High school dropouts aren't the only people having trouble with
this year's tax forms. Even tax professionals shake their heads at
some instructions prompted by the more complex provisions of the
1986 tax overhaul, which was initially billed as tax
``simplification.''
   This sentence is part of the Form 1040 instructions for
determining how much interest is deductible:
   ``If all of your mortgage debt on your principal home was
borrowed before August 17, 1986, (and you have not borrowed any new
amounts on that debt); OR, at all times in 1987, the total of your
mortgage debts was less than or equal to what you paid for the home
plus improvements (such as adding a room), the mortgage interest
you paid is fully deductible on line 9a or 9b, whichever applies.''
   Creme says that about 20 students training in law, business or
education will develop a more-readable W-4 withholding form; W-2
yearend wages-earned statement; 1099 interest-earned form and the
basic 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ forms.
   ``We're not saying we could bring it down to a second-grade
level, but we certainly can make it simpler,'' he said. ``If you
simplify the forms, people will be a lot less hostile toward the
IRS. And you'll raise a lot more revenue.''
   Creme and some of the students volunteered for the project
Monday while testifying before a Senate Finance subcommittee about
IRS penalties. The chairman, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., welcomed the
idea.
   Creme and Professor James W. Childs, director of the
university's Tax Clinic, said it is not difficult to figure out why
the tax forms and instructions are difficult. ``The average
sentence length of these publications exceeds 25 words,'' they said
in written testimony. ``One-third of the words in these
publications are multisyllabled words.''
   Creme's solution: ``By reducing the number of syllables and the
number of words in a sentence we can make the forms and
instructions significantly more readable. And we want to change how
the forms look _ change the spacing so things don't look so crammed
in.''
   IRS forms are developed in consultation with lawyers,
accountants and educators. In changing its forms last year to
reflect the new tax law, the IRS hired a consultant and even went
to some shopping malls for instant reaction from random taxpayers.
   As for the students' project, IRS spokesman Steve Pyrek says,
``One-syllable words are nice, but what do you do about
`dependents'?''
   The IRS estimates nearly half of taxpayers will pay
professionals to fill out their returns this year.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Bill Calling For 48-Hour Notification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate approval of a bill requiring the White
House to tell Congress about all covert actions within 48 hours
after the operations start marks a major step toward avoiding
another Iran-Contra affair, say the measure's sponsors.
   ``This will help immeasurably toward preventing the kind of
mistakes that were made'' in the Iran-Contra affair, Sen. David
Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said late
Tuesday after the Senate voted 71-19 in favor of the bill.
   The measure now goes to the House, where ``overwhelming
approval'' is likely, according to both Boren and Sen. William
Cohen, R-Maine, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
   The House Intelligence Committee is considering a similar bill,
but no date has been set for a vote by the panel or for floor
action.
   President Reagan has threatened to veto the legislation as an
unconstitutional restriction on his ability to conduct foreign
policy.
   But Boren said, ``That kind of threat has been heard before and
it hasn't come true.''
   Cohen noted that the 71 votes are four more than the two-thirds
which would be required to override any presidential veto. ``And
that 71 total is without some of our supporters here,'' he said.
   The bill arises from the Iran-Contra affair, when U.S. weapons
were secretly sold to Iran and some of the profits were diverted to
the Contra guerrillas in Nicaragua.
   Reagan withheld notification about the arms sales from Congress
for 10 months.
   Current laws require only that the White House give Congess
``timely notice'' about covert actions, but they do not define the
term. The Intelligence Committees had been operating on the
assumption that the phrase meant only a brief delay in notification.
   ``This bill clarifies what we thought was the procedure all
along,'' Cohen said. ``We believed timely meant a couple of days
and we were surprised to find out that the administration was
working under a different definition.''
   The measure doesn't give Congress a veto over covert operations,
Cohen noted.
   ``There's no piece of legislation that can weave a web of
security around good or bad judgment,'' said Cohen. ``I can't say
for sure this would have prevented Iran-Contra, but it would mean
that we can give the president the benefit of our advice. The
function we serve is to have a second opinion outside the
administration.''
   Boren said if the bill eventually becomes law, ``it will help''
prevent future problems because ``it clears up so many ambiguities
that are in the existing law. It makes the notification process so
much more clear.''
   But he warned that ``you can never prevent absolutely any future
Iran-Contras, anymore than a law against bank robberies will
prevent bank robberies.''
   In the wake of the Iran-Contra affair, Cohen noted, Reagan has
promised to tell Capitol Hill about all future covert actions and
has moved administratively to make many of the changes proposed in
the law. ``This only writes into law what the president has already
said he would do,'' Cohen said.
   The bill also requires written ``findings,'' which are the
presidential orders authorizing covert operations. Some actions in
the Iran-Contra affair were done under an oral finding which was
open to misinterpretation, Boren said.
   Before passing the bill, the Senate rejected, 60-32, a proposal
by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., to allow notification within 10 days,
instead of two days.
   Chafee said the time period was long enough to permit actions,
such as the rescue of hostages, in which lives might be endangered
by leaks of information, but short enough to discover situations
such as the Iranian arms sale.
   Earlier, the chamber voted 73-18 to limit debate. That was 13
more votes than needed to invoke cloture and block an attempt by
conservative Republicans to pass the measure.
   One opponent, Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., said: ``This bill is
badly drafted, badly conceived, and the worst of its conceptions is
that somehow you can legislate intelligence ... it's hard for me to
believe that one piece of legislation can obviate stupid activity.''
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci testified last week that
Reagan believed the bill was an unconstitutional restriction on
presidential authority and would veto it. Carlucci took over as
Reagan's national security adviser in the wake of the Iran-Contra
affair.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan easily
fielded one complicated economic question after another from a
congressional committee, but then one request stopped him cold.
   Who was on the Fed committee that charts national monetary
policy when it held its most recent meeting last month?
   That question, posed on Tuesday by Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., a
member of the House-Senate Joint Economic Committee, stumped
Greenspan and the six aides seated behind him, at least temporarily.
   At issue was a Feb. 9-10 meeting of the 12-member Federal Open
Market Committee, or FOMC. It is made up of the seven members of
the Federal Reserve Board and five regional Fed bank presidents.
   Greenspan, shuffling papers and conferring with his aides, made
a halting effort to name the five Fed bank presidents on the panel
in February _ and finally got four of the five right.
   ``You're a little bit fuzzy on just who voted in February,''
Melcher said.
   ``I'm not fuzzy on who voted. I know who was on the committee.
What I don't remember is which ones of them were on at that
particular time,'' said Greenspan, a former New York business
consultant who took command of the Fed last August.
   The committee meets every few months to chart the nation's
monetary policy.
   Melcher contends that the Fed committee is unconstitutional
because it holds vast power over U.S. economic policy even though
five of its members are not appointed by the president nor do they
undergo Senate confirmation. So far, federal courts have not agreed
with Melcher's assertion.
   At that February meeting, the committee voted to widen the
target range for the growth of the nation's money supply in 1988 _
an action that could bear on inflation and interest rates.
   Greenspan told the committee he was confused because committee
membership is rotated among the presidents of the 12 Fed banks _
and ``we're in the process now of changing.''
   Joseph Coyne, a spokesman for the Fed, said the rotation of
members onto the committee took place on March 1 _ after the last
meeting.
   For the record, the five bank president members of the committee
in February were Gerald E. Corrigan, president of the New York Fed,
a non-rotating position; Edward G. Boehne, Philadelphia; Robert H.
Boykin, Dallas; Silas Keehn, Chicago; and Gary H. Stern, Minnesota.
   The one Greenspan missed? Stern. Instead, he named St. Louis Fed
Chairman Thomas C. Melzer, not a voting member of the committee
then or now.

<HEAD>Kennedy, Administration Offer Similar Tax Break Bills For College
Savings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration and Democrats led by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy agree that tax breaks must be provided to
encourage parents to save early for college tuition costs that
continue to skyrocket.
   ``Rising costs threaten to put a college degree out of reach of
average families'' as well as the poor, Kennedy told the Senate
Finance Committee on Tuesday. ``We must find a safe, convenient and
simple way to help them meet tuition bills.''
   The Massachusetts Democrat has drafted a plan that would
encourage tuition savings by making interest on U.S. Savings Bonds
tax free if the bonds are used for college tuition.
   Families earning under $75,000 a year would receive the full
benefit of the legislation. The tax break would be reduced for
families earning more, decreasing until it is completely phased out
at the $150,000 income level.
   ``There is an excellent chance that many families who are not
saving now will do so, using this safe, convenient plan,'' Kennedy
said.
   Assistant Treasury Secretary O. Donaldson Chapoton said the
Reagan administration's College Savings Bond proposal is similar to
the Kennedy bill, providing tax exemptions on interest for parents
who save for college.
   But the eligibility is lower under the president's plan, which
calls for a phasing out of the tax break for families earning
between $60,000 and $80,000.
   The administration's proposal also would allow tax-free interest
on savings bonds used to cover part of a student's living expenses
in addition to tuition, books and other fees.
   Chapoton said the administration version eventually would cost
about $1 billion in lost revenues, but said the incentives are
``urgently needed'' as college tuition continues to skyrocket.
   ``We're coming perilously close to a time when only the wealthy
can attend the university of their choice,'' said Sen. Robert T.
Stafford, R-Vt., who is backing the Kennedy bill.
   Kennedy said his measure, also supported by Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., is expected to cost about $300 million five years into the
program. But he said because the government saves $60 million for
every $1 billion sold in savings bonds, the plan eventually could
be self-financing.
   Chapoton warned that by the year 2007, the total cost of
attending a four-year private university will be $200,000. Today,
it is more than $50,000, nearly doubling since 1980, he said.
Federal grants and loans, meanwhile, have stayed about the same.
   ``If we're going to continue to compete, we have to have a
competitive education,'' said Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, who is supporting the Kennedy bill.
   Chapoton said the administration opposes legislation that would
restore the interest payment deduction on college loans.
   In a related matter, officials from Michigan complained about a
proposal by the Internal Revenue Service to tax Michigan's
guaranteed college tuition trust.
   Wyoming, Maine, Florida, Indiana and Tennessee have adopted
guaranteed tuition programs similar to Michigan's.
   The Michigan trust allows payment into a state fund in return
for guaranteed tuition.
   The IRS ruled that people buying trust contracts on behalf of
children would have no additional tax liability, but that the trust
itself is subject to federal taxes, Michigan Gov. James Blanchard
said Tuesday at a Washington news conference.
   Federal taxes could add up to 20 percent to the cost of a trust
contract, if the trust were to invest fully in taxable bonds,
Michigan Treasurer Robert Bowman said.
   IRS spokeswoman Johnell Hunter declined to comment on its
ruling, or even to acknowledge a ruling had been made.
   ``We do not feel that it should be taxed,'' said Herbert Conley,
director of the Florida treasury division. ``We are basically
setting up a trust where these are going to be state dollars, and
at no time will the purchaser of a contract have any control of the
monies once they are paid.''

   The faces stare at you in unrelenting
succession, none with a smile. They are faces of adults without
hope and children without childhood.
   There is photograph after photograph of families being evicted,
mother and children sitting outdoors on their piled-up belongings.
They are pictures that have the impact of war, of the Great
Depression, of children orphaned and victimized by fighting not of
their making.
   These are the scenes in a new exhibit called ``Homeless in
America,'' that opened Tuesday at the Corcoran Gallery, a block
from the White House. The exhibit of 64 pictures will tour 32
cities in the coming years to act as, in the words of its sponsors,
``a centerpiece for public education.''
   ``It's a national disgrace that in this country of plenty there
are people who don't have a place to live,,'' said Susie Elson,
immediate past president of the National Mental Health Association,
which joined in producing the exhibit along with Families for the
Homeless, a group that includes congressional, administration and
media families.
   Tipper Gore, wife of the senator from Tennessee, headed the
project.
   ``In America we have become adjusted to the image of poverty,''
she said. ``The half-clothed child in a shack in Appalachia is what
many people still think of when they think about poor people in
this country,'' she said before the exhibit opened. ``Today's
realities far outstrip this outdated image and that is why we felt
it was important to have top photojournalists communicate through
the power of their images.''
   Simultaneously with the opening of the exhibit, a book of the
photographs was published. Many of the photographers represented in
the exhibit and book were commissioned by Michael Evans, formerly
President Reagan's personal photographer.
   ``The exhibit will endure as a lasting work of art and that,
too, is important,'' said Mrs. Gore. ``But the key component, the
key element is using the photographs to ... drive home that there
are maybe three million homeless people in this country, that they
are families, that they are children, the elderly, that they are
veterans, that they are mentally ill, that they are the most
vulnerable people in our society and that they are growing.''
   Evans said the project cost $450,000. Its principal funding was
provided by Triangle Industries, Inc.
   The photographs, all black and white, depict such urban scenes
as a pair of legs sticking from a box that obviously served as a
night's accommodations; a child eating from a metal bowl in her
home, under an underpass; a small girl weeping as a humane society
worker removes her cat in a cage, prior to her own eviction;
families with their belongings in plastic bags.
   They show two young men scavenging through a metal trash
container; a man and woman asleep on a park bench, his knee serving
as her pillow; a food line, with the splendor of the Dallas skyline
as a backdrop.
   The honorary patron of the project is Barbara Bush, wife of the
vice president. The board of directors includes Susan Baker, wife
of White House chief of staff Howard Baker.

<HEAD>Total Wheat Exports To Reach 1.55 Billion In Year Ending May 31</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Subsidized sales are expected to account for
more than 60 percent of all U.S. wheat exports this year, according
to projections by the Agriculture Department.
   Total wheat exports are forecast at a six-year high of 1.55
billion bushels in the marketing year that runs through May 31, up
54 percent from 1986-87.
   Sales of subsidized wheat under the Export Enhancement Program,
or EEP, have climbed rapidly this year, particularly since last
October, says the department's Economic Research Service.
   Big sales have been made to the Soviet Union and China, the two
largest wheat importers, as well as to Poland, Algeria, Egypt,
Morocco and Iraq, the agency said in a new outlook report.
   The program was started three years ago in selected overseas
markets to counter subsidized exports by U.S. competiors, notably
the European Economic Community. Under EEP, exporters get free
government-owned surplus commodities as bonuses, or subsidies, so
they can sell wheat _ or other eligible products _ to designated
foreign countries.
   Since June 1, 1985, according to the report, the United States
has announced ``initiatives'' or offers to sell wheat to 30
countries for a total of 43.1 million metric tons. Through Feb. 11,
the actual sales totaled 31.4 million tons, most of it since last
fall.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The projected export total this marketing year of 1.55
billion bushels would be about 42 million tons, of which more than
25 million tons is expected to be shipped under EEP.
   The brisk sales have boosted U.S. wheat export prices, the
report said. The average price at Gulf ports loaded aboard ship for
hard red winter wheat of ordinary protein rose to about $130 per
ton in January from $116 in November and $110 in January 1987.
   Rising prices also meant that the EEP subsidies increased. Those
averaged about $34 per ton during the 1986-87 marketing year but
rose in November and December before easing off in January, the
report said. For example, the subsidy for the Soviet Union rose to
more than $40 per ton but later dropped to less than $30.
   ``The total value of wheat bonuses awarded from the first wheat
offer through January 1988 is approximately $1.1 billion,'' the
report said. ``Nearly 40 percent of the total has been awarded
since Oct. 1, 1987.''
   Meanwhile, the EEP subsidies and the rise in U.S. wheat exports
has had an impact on world trade, the report showed.
   In the current 1987-88 marketing year, the United States
produced about 11 percent of the world output of wheat, the same as
in 1986-87.
   But the boom in exports _ to 1.55 billion bushels from 1 billion
bushels the previous year _ is giving the United States an
estimated 41 percent of the world's wheat exports, compared with
only 30 percent in 1986-87.
   According to agency records, that puts the U.S. export share at
its highest level since 1982-83 when it was 42 percent.

   Fat-conscious consumers soon may be able to
buy leaner hot dogs, bologna and other cooked sausages.
   The Agriculture Department has approved a rule change that will
let processors make make leaner products by substituting water for
fat, so long as there is no loss of nutritional value.
   The leaner products can be labeled as ``lite,'' ``light,'' or
``lower fat'' if they contain at least a fourth less fat than
similar cooked sausage products on the market, officials said. The
labels must include a comparison that explains the term.
   For example, the label for lower-fat hotdogs might say: ``This
product contains 20 percent fat, while USDA allows 30 percent fat
in meat hot dogs.''
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said Tuesday the change in
regulations will be effective on April 14 and ``reflects our desire
to facilitate the marketing of lower-fat products.''
   Current federal rules for cooked sausages limit fat to 30
percent and ``added'' water to 10 percent. The new rule will limit
the combination of fat and added water to 40 percent of the product.
   The maximum fat content in the finished product will continue to
be limited to 30 percent, but the water restriction will be removed
so that processors can substitute some of the water for fat _ and
wind up with a lower-fat product, Crawford said.
   Protein content, which is indirectly controlled by the limits on
fat and added water, will remain unchanged and will be comparable
to other cooked sausages, he said.
   The rule change is being made at the request of the American
Meat Institute, a private trade association, which asked USDA to
develop a standard for light frankfurthers and similar cooked
sausages. The proposed change was announced by the agency on Nov.
25, 1986.

<HEAD>11-Ton Satellite to be Retrieved by Shuttle Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-ton satellite in orbit three years
longer than planned will be rescued by a space shuttle crew next
year, just months before it would fall back to Earth in pieces.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Tuesday
included the retrieval of the satellite _ the Long Duration
Exposure Facility _ in a new schedule of flights and cargoes. The
rescue was added to a mission beginning July 13.
   The orbit of the satellite, which gauged the effects of space's
hostile environment on metal coatings and on 13 million seeds, is
decaying and officials fear it will crash through the atmosphere
and break up if it is not recaptured by mid-1990.
   The new schedule makes no change in the date of the much-delayed
first post-Challenger flight, now set for Aug. 4. There have been
no American manned missions in space since the Challenger _ the
25th shuttle mission _ exploded on liftoff Jan. 28, 1986 and killed
its seven-member crew.
   The six-sided Long Duration Exposure Facility _ LDEF in space
jargon _ was tossed overboard by astronauts in April 1984 to be hit
by meteors, pelted by cosmic rays and corroded by oxygen atoms.
   The bus-size frame held 57 experiments, including one that
tested 120 varieties of vegetables, fruits and flowers to see
whether cosmic radiation caused useful genetic changes. The LDEF
was to have been retrieved by another shuttle mission 10 months
later and brought back in the cargo bay.
   But delays in the space program combined with grounding of all
shuttles after the Challenger disaster kept the 11-ton satellite in
its lonely journey around Earth. The $14 million package has no
on-board propulsion systems or ability to transmit signals.
   It is orbiting 292 miles above Earth, according to the North
American Defense Command.
   The NASA schedule also calls for six small and medium-sized
expendable rockets to be launched this year, four in 1989 and seven
in 1990.
   The shuttle schedule reverses the order of one military and one
civilian flight early next year. This enables NASA to orbit a pair
of huge communications satellites earlier than planned. They will
be needed in June 1989 when the $1 billion Hubble Space Telescope
is launched from a shuttle.
   NASA places such emphasis on the two communications satellites
that they will be the principal cargoes on the first and third
flights in the new series. Together they will provide
communications with the shuttle 95 percent of the time it is in
orbit and be a spaceborne switchboard for many satellites.
   NASA was forced to change its priorities for shuttle payloads in
order to be ready to launch the Magellan probe to map Venus at a
time when the least amount of fuel will be needed to traverse the
90 million miles.
   The Magellan flight is scheduled for April 27 and it will be the
first U.S. planetary mission since a Pioneer probe was launched to
Venus in 1978.
   NASA has scheduled the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope for
June 1, 1989, and another important planetary flight _ Galileo _
for Oct. 8, 1989. Galileo is a cooperative project with Germany to
survey Jupiter and its moons.
   The first shuttle flight will have a five-man crew commanded by
Navy Capt. Frederick Hauck.
   The next mission, scheduled on the Atlantis for Oct. 27, will
launch two military communications satellites. The next flight,
Discovery again, will be on Jan. 19, 1989 and the fourth, using
Columbia, will be March 2 _ a Defense Department mission to launch
an advanced reconnaissance satellite.
   A Spacelab mission _ so-called because a complete laboratory is
carried in the shuttle's cargo bay _ was delayed in the new
schedule to push the TDRS satellite ahead.
   NASA said the mission to study the universe in the ultraviolet
spectrum is being reconfigured to enhance study of the brightest
exploding star seen by astronomers in more than 200 years. The
discovery of Supernova 1987A has drawn attention of astrophysicists
around the world.
   The new schedule also adds two Spacelab flights in 1990, using
the shuttle Columbia. Also, the Gamma Ray Observatory has been
moved forward in the schedule to March 1990. The Ulysses mission to
study the sun and its environment remains in an October 1990 launch
date.

<HEAD>Senate Clears Measure To Set Cap On Legal Immigration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate sponsors of a bill to change the
nation's legal immigration system say they'll begin negotiations
with key House members, and push for final passage this year.
   Despite the Senate's 88-4 vote Tuesday for the legislation,
there is no indication that the House is ready to tackle the bil 16
months after Congress enacted a landmark law to curb illegal
immigration.
   The current immigration control bill took six years to pass
Congress, as large numbers of special interest groups prevented a
consensus until the fall of 1986.
   In contrast, the new legislation was guided through the Senate
with a minimum of debate by Democrat Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts and Republican Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming. They had
smoothed the way by holding extensive discussions with their
colleagues.
   The bill deals with those who apply through normal government
channels to come here _ not with illegal immigrants.
   The Senate measure would establish a cap on legal immigration to
the United States. It would maintain the current priority for
applicants with relatives in this country, but vastly expand
immigration visas for those with needed labor and professional
skills.
   The most influential House member on immigration matters,
Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr., has said he wants
to move slowly until Congress has a better idea of how the 1986 law
is working.
   That means no immediate action, but does not rule out approval
of the legislation later this year.
   Kennedy and Simpson said they plan to initiate discussions with
Rodino soon.
   Simpson's spokeswoman, Mary Kay Hill, said the senator thinks
House leaders ``can see the need to reform the (legal immigation)
system.''
   Others expected to be part of the consultations include Rep.
Romano Mazzoli, D-Ky., chairman of the Judiciary panel's
immigration subcommittee; Rep. Patrick L. Swindall of Georgia,
ranking Republican on the subcommittee; and Rep. Charles E.
Schumer, D-N.Y., who has introduced a measure similar to the Senate
bill.
   The Senate measure is expected to allow more Western Europeans
into the country by expanding the number of visas for those without
family members here.
   Sponsors say the family preference system has resulted in 85
percent of the immigrants to the United States coming from Asia and
Latin America.
   Ninety percent of the people immigrating to the United States
arrive under the family system. The remaining 10 percent come in
under other categories including job and professional skills.
   Rodino has expressed worry that any new bill would interfere
with family reunification. Simpson said that would not happen,
because the Senate's cap is 100,000 above the currrent figures.
   The maximum number of visas under the Senate bill would be
590,000 annually.
   Under this umbrella, 470,000 visas in each of the first three
years (440,000 thereafter) would be reserved for family
immigration, and 120,000 (150,000 after three years) would be for
the new ``independent'' category.
   Currently, spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens can enter
the country without limitation.
   Schumer's bill would have a more generous cap of 750,000,
including refugees fleeing from persecution. The Senate cap does
not include refugees, who now are admitted under a separte law that
sets annual limits. The current refugee cap is 68,500.
   Schumer has said there may be attempts in the House to link a
legal immigration bill with proposals to extend an amnesty program
for some of those who came here illegally. The 1986 law grants
legalization to those who have lived in this country since before
Jan. 1, 1982, but the program ends May 4.
   Simpson opposes an extension, and conservative senators would be
expected to filibuster if an extension were added to a legal
immigration bill, according to Simpson and Kennedy staffers.
   Rodino has favored an extension, but has not said whether he
desires linking the issues.
   Voting against the bill in the Senate were Democrat Dennis
DeConcini of Arizona, and three Republicans: Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, Pete Wilson of California and Mark Hatfield of Oregon.

<HEAD>Officials Say NRC Statements May Imperil Prosecution Of Spill Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors fear that statements by
Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials may have jeopardized their
investigation of a 1986 radioactive spill at an Ohio military base,
according to agency documents.
   The Democratic staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee released documents Tuesday that include a memo from an
NRC official who said other NRC representatives believed
regulations governing the incident were ambiguous and open to
interpretation.
   The memo also said Christopher Barnes, assistant U.S. attorney
for the southern district of Ohio, believed those statements may
have ``significantly impacted'' on the chances for a successful
prosecution of officials involved in the spill.
   The case involves a Sept. 18, 1986, spill of highly radioactive
Americium-241 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio.
The spill occurred when workers opened an unlabeled drum at a base
storage facility.
   Air Force officials have said almost no radiation escaped from
the building despite a second spill Oct. 6 while a cleanup was
under way. The building eventually had to be torn down at a cost of
$1 million.
   An inspection by the NRC's Region III office in Chicago
determined that the Air Force's failure to report the incident
promptly violated an NRC regulation requiring disclosure within 24
hours of any incident that threatens to shut down operations of a
facility for one day or more or causes over $2,000 in property
damage.
   The documents released by the Senate committee included a
January memo from Eugene T. Pawlik, director of the NRC's Region
III investigations field office in Chicago. Pawlik's memo refers to
a December 1987 meeting between two NRC officials at the agency's
Region IV office in Arlington, Texas, and Barnes.
   Pawlik said Barnes met with Jerry Everett, nuclear materials
safety section chief for the NRC, and Charles Cain, radiation
specialist.
   According to the NRC memo, Everett said the NRC regulations
governing disclosure were ambiguous and the NRC had not
communicated to the Air Force a full interpretation of how the
regulations were to be implemented.
   And Cain stated that the first spill was open to interpretation
and not reportable and that in his mind the Air Force was not
negligible in waiting to file a report.
   ``I think it is a fair assessment to say that the two recent
interviews of Everett and Cain have at this late date placed most,
if not all, of the ... investigation in jeopardy,'' Pawlik said in
the memo.
   Everett and Cain declined comment on the documents Tuesday
through a spokesman.
   Americium powder is not considered dangerous on the skin, but
small amounts can cause cancer if inhaled or otherwise introduced
into the body.

<HEAD>Baptist Minister Fired For Saying Jews Don't Need Jesus To be
Saved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNION, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Southern Baptist minister says he was fired
from his denomination's regional mission board because he believes
Jews can achieve salvation without converting to Christianity.
   The Rev. George Sheridan of the First Baptist Church here was
regional director of interfaith witness for the Southern Baptist
Convention's Home Mission Board for 12 years. The region runs from
North Carolina to Maine and west to Michigan.
   As director of the interfaith witness, Sheridan was the Southern
Baptist liaison with other religious groups, including Jews.
   A statement from the mission board's Atlanta headquarters said
Sheridan ``was not fired or terminated'' but ``declined transfer''
from New Jersey to a position as an editorial assistant at the
headquarters.
   But Sheridan, 45, said Tuesday he was fired, and has hired an
attorney to counter any claims by the mission board that he
resigned.
   The minister believes he was fired because he opposed Southern
Baptist plans to begin a program aimed at converting Jews. The
program was discussed at a private meeting in New York last year.
   Sheridan said he was asked in June to submit to the board a
written statement about his theological views about Jews.
   ``In the absence of any Biblical contradiction, I believe that
the Jews of today, as ever, receive salvation through their having
been chosen by God in covenant with Abraham, Moses and the
prophets,'' Sheridan wrote in his statement.
   He said board members grilled him about his views when he was
summoned to a special meeting in Atlanta in November. The board
informed him in a letter dated Jan. 9 that he was being assigned,
he said.
   Sheridan said he has not been able to determine if the board
considered his views heretical, and added that the board had not
given him a specific reason for removing him from his post.
   In 1987, the national convention of the United Church of Christ
accepted the view that Jews can achieve salvation without believing
in Jesus. Opposition to attempts to convert Jews often is based on
this view.

<HEAD>Farm Lawmakers Flirt With Big New Trade Subsidy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers may make a massive new farm subsidy
program part of sweeping trade legislation, while its chief backer
argues that U.S. trade negotiators want it despite the threat of a
presidential veto.
   The subsidy plan known as a ``triggered marketing loan'' was
included in the Senate version of the 1,000-page trade bill. House
and Senate negotiators are working on a compromise.
   Final action on the loan program was postponed when House
Agriculture Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, said Tuesday
that Senate Agriculture Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., had the
votes but wanted a few revisions.
   Under marketing loan programs, some of which already are in
effect, producers receive the U.S. price for their crops, which are
then sold at world market prices. The taxpayers make up the
difference.
   The plan under consideration would create such provisions for
wheat, corn and soybeans but only if current negotiations failed to
produce an agreement among the nation's trading partners to reduce
agricultural subsidies by the 1990 wheat marketing year.
   Leahy said he was convinced of the need for a triggered
marketing loan on a trip to Geneva last week to get a progress
report on negotiations aimed at reaching a new General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   He said European negotiators have been ``arrogant'' in their
rejection of U.S. demands for an end to export subsidies. He said
Americans at the table in Geneva favor the triggered marketing loan
as a ``club'' to hold over the Europeans and prod them on the issue.
   ``If you were talking to some of the people we have to negotiate
with, then you might think we need it, too,'' Leahy said.
   In other action, the panel approved expanding the 1985 Export
Enhancement Program by more than $1 billion to $2.5 billion. It
provides bonuses in the form of government-held commodities to
exporters to ship American commodities that they acquired at U.S.
prices.
   Critics of the triggered marketing loan program said that the
sum involved could strain the budget.
   ``This is potentially a huge sum of money we're talking about in
agricultural programs,'' said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., whose
home-state growers are often wary of anything that could prompt
restrictions abroad against orange and grapefruit exports.
   Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, said the use of such a measure
as a bargaining chip would not be credible now because it would
require reshuffling budget priorities.
   Stenholm did say he favored the objective. He said the United
States should tell the European Community: ``If they have unlimited
supplies of money, it's going to cost all of it and we're going to
raise you five.''
   Gibbons presented a letter from Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter and other
administration officials suggesting that attaching the program
could prompt a presidential veto for the trade bill.

   Jesse Jackson set aside his disappointment in
finishing second in his home state primary Tuesday night and
focused on his overall strength, saying ``I am where every
candidate wishes he could be tonight.''
   Jackson had predicted he would finish first in Illinois and
defeat another favorite son, Paul Simon. But the results showed
just the opposite.
   ``I finished second, it seems, in Illinois,'' Jackson said.
``(But) I'm a winner. I am the leading contender for the Democratic
nomination. I am where every candidate wishes he could be tonight.''
   A noticeably tired Jackson told supporters at a downtown Chicago
hotel that both he and Simon had reason to celebrate. Illinois
voters, he said, ``paid their respects on a sitting senator who
focused on one state.''
   Jesse Jackson voted near his South Side home earlier in the day,
accompanied by sons Jesse Jr., 23, and Jonathan, 22, at the Bryn
Mawr Community Church.
   The Democratic candidate said his message to ``stop drugs from
coming into our country, save our jobs, secure our farmers and
invest in our children'' has touched voters and given them
something to fight for.
   ``I have run all the way, and we've been winning all the way,
and we'll keep winning,'' Jackson said. Jackson had hoped to add
Illinois to a string of successes over the last week, beginning
with Super Tuesday and continuing over the weekend in South
Carolina. He and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis top the
delegate count.
   Jackson voted shortly after 9 a.m. in a small church room jammed
with reporters, photographers and a handful of bewildered-looking
voters.
   Afterward, donning a topcoat on a chilly day, Jackson said he
was touched by ``the joy I see in my children voting. When I was
their age, I did not have the right to vote.''
   ``It says a lot about the greatness of America, the fact that we
have the right to grow to our potential,'' Jackson said. ``Hope is
going to prevail.''
   The South Carolina native said he has been the most effective
and best managed candidate, despite relatively weak financing.
   ``If my opponents had my budget, they could not compete,''
Jackson said. ``If I had their budgets, they could not compete.''
   Jackson, whose delegate total was second only to Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis' going into Tuesday's primary, said he has
broadened his base of support since waging his first presidential
campaign four years ago.
   ``Expectations are higher; the experience factor is greater and
I've had a chance to serve more people,'' Jackson said. ``People
who feel that the process was not working for them find hope in the
campaign. ... Now they feel there is a way out. There is hope.''

   Students who skip Professor Gerald M.
Phillips' opening lecture in his course on group decision-making
may find themselves searching the campus in vain for any trace of
him the rest of the semester.
   That's because the Penn State University professor communicates
with his Speech Communications 350 class only through the school's
computer system, by electronic mail or ``E-mail.''
   The class does get weekly lectures, from two graduate students,
and other graduate students sit in on group discussions as
``consultants.''
   ``We've got a real industrial model,'' said Phillips, who this
semester has 212 students enrolled in the course. ``What we've got
here is a simulation of top management, middle management and
employees.''
   Phillips considers himself the chief executive officer. As such,
he monitors computer messages between student groups and the
graduate students, and answers questions sent to him.
   ``I can monitor everything. They know I'm monitoring. I'm the
CEO. I can get all the information on my company,'' Phillips said.
   Phillips, 59, doesn't go to his office on campus often. He
prefers to stay home, a mile away, working from his cramped study
filled with computer equipment.
   Graduate students who have been there have dubbed his study
``the bridge of the Starship Enterprise,'' after the spaceship on
the television series ``Star Trek.''
   Phillips said he is giving students a taste of the real world,
adding that he is more accessible than most professors.
   Last spring, in a trial run of the course, Phillips said he
answered 3,169 questions from students.
   ``You find me a professor anywhere in North America that can
handle 3,169 questions _ and they weren't stupid questions,''
Phillips said.
   Students who miss Phillips' lecture on the first day of class
can only guess at the appearance of the professor known by his
computer address ``gmp.''
   ``One says she's going to track me down to see what I look like
and talk to me face to face. I said `Catch me if you can,''' said
Phillips.
   One student who asked that her name not be used said the course
puts too much emphasis on computer communication.
   ``It's like E-Mail is God,'' she said. ``It really shouldn't be
like that. There has to be some communication that is one-on-one.''
   Others disagree.
   ``I don't think we've suffered any because we haven't seen him
face to face,'' said Michael Guerin, a senior operations management
major from Rochester, N.Y. ``He's readily available on the
computer.''
   Phillips has a contract to write a book on the course, which he
said has generated widespread interest.
   ``We've been visited by educators from Norway, Australia and
Japan. A lot of people are looking over our shoulder in this
process,'' he said.
   Warner Burke, a professor at Teachers College of Columbia
University, said Phillips' emphasis on mimicking a corporate
hierarchy hinders the students' understanding of how they come to
their decisions.
   ``Here our goals are understanding the group process, not just
decision making,'' said Burke, director of Teachers College's
graduate program in organizational psychology. ``The most important
aspect of group processes is non-verbal behavior.''

   Former Mayor Jane Byrne's bid for a political
comeback ended in defeat Tuesday, but House Minority Leader Bob
Michel, President Reagan's point man in Congress, easily overcame
his first GOP primary challenge in 32 years.
   Michel's Democratic arch-foe, attorney G. Douglas Stephens, won
the Democratic primary, setting the stage for a November rematch of
the 1982 contest that almost cost Michel his 18th District seat.
   With nearly three-quarters of the votes counted, Michel defeated
Tazewell County Board Chairman James E. Unsicker by 85 percent to
15 percent, while Stephens beat an unemployed recent college
graduate, Justin Z. West, 89 percent to 11 percent.
   The state Board of Elections said between 45 percent and 48
percent of the state's 5.9 million registered voters went to the
polls.
   In Chicago, Mrs. Byrne lost to Aurelia Pucinski in a race for
the Democratic nomination for clerk of the circuit court. With
nearly three-quarters of the vote reported, Mrs. Puchinski had 53
percent of the Democratic primary vote.
   ``It means that when the people spoke, they apparently shouted.
... I am very good at taking hints,'' Mrs. Byrne said. Asked
whether she would consider running for office again, she said,
``I'm not even thinking of it right now.''
   Ed Vrdolyak, former Democratic powerbroker who left the party,
was unopposed on the Republican side and will face Mrs. Pucinski in
November.
   Also back on Illinois ballots were followers of political
extremist Lyndon LaRouche. At least 20 LaRouche supporters were
candidates in races ranging from president to county register of
deeds.
   In Southern Illinois, the retirement of veteran Rep. Melvin
Price, a Democrat, set off a four-man scramble in the 21st District
primary. Vying for the party's nomination were St. Clair County
Board Chairman Jerry F. Costello, Madison County Auditor Pete
Fields; former Price administrative aide Mike Mansfield and
perennial local candidate Steve Maragides.
   In the 22nd District, state Sen. Glenn Poshard of Carterville
was unopposed in the Democratic primary as he moved to succeed Rep.
Kenneth Gray, who is retiring after 12 terms. Pete Prineas of
Carbondale and Patrick J. Kelley of Carbondale sought the GOP
nomination.
   Chicago voters held a non-binding referendum on the training of
Illinois National Guard troops in Central America. With roughly
three-quarters of the precincts reporting, those wanted to stop
sending Illinois troops to Central America outnumbered those
favoring the foreign-training program about 2-to-1.
   Neighbors of Chicago's Wrigley Field also opposed night games at
the Cubs' vintage ballpark, piling up 3-to-1 margin in early
returns in a non-binding referendum. With four of 21 precincts
counted, 692 voters opposed lighting Wrigley for night baseball and
237 supported night games.

   Chicago's City Council in February approved lights at Wrigley
Field, the only major-league ballpark without them, after years of
controversy. The issue pitted neighborhood groups concerned about
noise, litter and parking problems against the Cubs' owners,
Tribune Co., which argued the team was losing prime-time television
revenues.
   The latest bid for office by Mrs. Byrne, who lost the mayor's
office to Harold Washington in 1983 after one term, was made
without the backing of the party, which supported her opponent,
Mrs. Pucinski. Vrdolyak became a Republican after a failed
third-party challenge to Washington.
   Michel defeated Stephens six years ago with 51.6 percent of the
vote after the toughest campaign fight of his career. His office
attributed the tight race to redistricting.
   The LaRouche candidates were back two years after winning the
Democratic primary for lieutenant governor and secretary of state.
Illinois Democrats tried without success this year to remove La
Rouche candidates from the party.
   In the 21st Congressional District, the winner of the Democratic
fight will face Republican Robert H. ``Bob'' Gaffner, who was
unopposed in the primary. In 1986, he came within 943 votes of
upsetting Price, who is leaving Capitol Hill after 44 years.
   Gray held his 22nd District seat from 1955 to 1975, when he
retired for health reasons, and in 1985 returned to Congress for
two additional terms.

<HEAD>Dukakis Puts Best Face on Third-Place Finish In Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis
declared himself undaunted by a third-place finish in the Illinois
primary, saying ``the field is wide open'' in coming contests.
   ``Now we move on to Michigan where there are no favorite sons,''
a somewhat subdued Dukakis said at a news conference Tuesday night
at a Boston television station.
   Two Illinois home-state favorites _ Sen. Paul Simon and civil
rights leader Jesse Jackson, who has made Chicago his home _
finished well ahead of the Massachusetts governor. On the other
hand, Dukakis' showing was far better than that of Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. of Tennessee, who failed to demonstrate any appreciable
strength outside his Southern base.
   Dukakis said his third-place showing in a state where he
invested more than $350,000 was not a setback.
   ``I don't get disappointed. ... I was running against two
citizens of Illinois who had strong bases and a great deal of
support from those who know them,'' Dukakis said. ``We did what I
can characterize was a respectable third.''
   Those around the Massachusetts governor echoed his contention
that his showing was good under the circumstances. Leslie Dach, a
spokesman for the Dukakis campaign, ``We did as well as we
expected.'' Campaign manager Susan Estrich added, ``We did beat all
the non-favorite sons.''
   During the Illinois campaign, Dukakis had said a vote for Simon
would increase the chances of a brokered Democratic National
Convention, something he said would be a ``disaster.''
   Tuesday night, Dukakis said, ``I've been making a number of
calls around the country to key Democrats and there is an
overwhelming sentiment that we should get behind a nominee.
   ``I don't believe we have any front-runners; I don't think we're
going to have a front-runner until the convention,'' Dukakis said.
   The seven days between Super Tuesday and the Illinois primary
left Dukakis too little time to attract strong support in Illinois,
he said.
   But he said effort and money expended in Illinois will pay off
later, if he is the Democratic nominee.
   Dukakis wasn't about to make any bold predictions on Michigan's
caucus March 26.
   ``I don't have to win any primary. I have to do as well as I
possibly can. When you have a multi-candidate field, the vote tends
to get split up,'' he said, adding that he hoped Michigan would
help winnow the field.
   Dach said Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, the big Democratic
loser on Super Tuesday, would be competing fiercely with Dukakis
for labor votes in Michigan.

<HEAD>Probe Arms-To-Philippines Plot Pointing To Marcos</HEAD>

   Investigators are trying to learn whether
Ferdinand Marcos was behind a plot to ship weapons from the United
States to forces loyal to him in the Philippines, federal officials
say.
   U.S. officials suspect the ousted Philippines president may have
been instrumental in abortive plans to supply automatic rifles and
submachine guns for an 80-member force.
   Marcos' chief American attorney, however, denies Marcos was
involved in any arms shipments. ``That's a dry well for you, my
friend,'' Richard A. Hibey said Friday in Washington. ``There's no
truth to that allegation.''
   Details of the planned arms sale surfaced here last fall during
a federal trial of Leon Dicker, a disbarred Hewlett, N.Y., lawyer
convicted of conspiring to export weapons illegally.
   At trial, the government said the arms were bound for Thailand.
But two federal officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said last week that authorities believe the weapons were for
pro-Marcos forces in the Philippines.
   Dicker, two men acquitted in the case and one who pleaded guilty
and testified for the prosecution were arrested in a U.S. Customs
Service ``sting.'' No arms were alleged to have changed hands.
   The officials said New York businessman Robert L. Steele is a
focus of the continuing investigation. During the trial, the
prosecutor said Steele had worked with Dicker on the arms deal, but
Steele was not charged.
   Steele and Dicker have been linked to Orlando C. Dulay, a Marcos
supporter and former provincial governor later linked by Philippine
military sources to an August 1987 coup attempt in the Philippines.
   Dulay, detained by authorities in August 1986 on the grounds of
a Marcos-owned estate near Princeton University, said Steel and
Dicker were his ``lawyers'' who had sent him to clean up the
court-sealed property at Marcos' request.
   A newspaper in Manila reported last week that Dulay was
contacted by U.S. authorities who traveled there seeking his
cooperation in the investigation of alleged arms shipments to
pro-Marcos groups.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Peyton in Honolulu on Monday
confirmed that he met with Dulay last week, but said he could not
comment further because of an ``ongoing criminal investigation.''
   Raul Rabe, deputy chief of mission at the Philippines Embassy in
Washington, said Dulay recently ``surfaced in Honolulu and joined
Mr. Marcos'' before being deported to the Philippines, where he
faces charges in the 1986 slayings of three campaign workers of
President Corazon Aquino.
   Marcos has been living in exile in Honolulu since his 1986
ouster and the election of Mrs. Aquino as president. He has said he
wishes to return to his homeland. Marcos supporters failed in two
1987 coup attempts.
   Last year, two U.S. businessmen testifying before a House
subcommittee played secretly recorded conversations with Marcos and
said that Marcos had sought to buy weapons for shipment to the
Philippines.
   The weapons discussed in the House testimony allegedly were to
be used for a coup attempt in late June, four months after Dicker's
arrest. It could not be determined if the alleged June coup
attempt, the Dicker case and the Honolulu investigation were
related.
   A government source said U.S. authorities suspect a link between
Marcos and the New Jersey arms case, but declined to provide
specifics.
   Abelardo Morua, Dicker's co-defendant who pleaded guilty, was
questioned recently by federal authorities about a possible link
between Marcos and the weapons deal, said Morua's attorney, Chris
Franzblau. He said Morua provided no information.
   Several government officials with knowledge of the
investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that to
discuss the case openly could jeopardize a prosecution.
   Neither U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. nor Richard Mercier,
head of the Customs Service's Newark office, would comment on the
case.
   ``Our policy is never to confirm or deny any inquiry,'' said
Leonard S. Walton, Customs' director of illegal export
investigations in Washington.
   On Monday, Marcos issued a statement denying he was ``bent on
taking control (of the Philippines) through violent means.''
   The news that authorities are pressing the investigation in this
new direction surfaced last Wednesday when U.S. District Judge
Alfred J. Lechner Jr., in sentencing Morua here, referred to a
continuing probe.
   Steele did not return repeated phone calls this week and last at
his Manhattan conglomerate, Commonwealth Group Ltd., a private
company.
   Dicker, sentenced to four years, said he could not comment on
the matter because he was appealing his conviction.

<HEAD>Man Conquers North America's Highest Peak Solo; Lives To Talk
About It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American, the first mountaineer to
conquer North America's highest peak alone in winter, left a
Japanese flag atop Mount McKinley to honor the man who tried _ and
failed _ before him.
   Vern Tejas ended a monthlong ordeal of screaming winds and
subzero temperatures on Tuesday, picked up by plane on McKinley's
flank and flown to Anchorage, 130 miles to the south.
   During the climb Tejas often thought about Japanese climber
Naomi Uemura, the only other person to reach the 20,320-foot summit
in a solo winter climb but who disappeared during his descent in
February 1984 and was never found.
   ``Many times I was wondering, `Is this where he slipped? Is this
where he lost it?' '' Tejas said Tuesday in Anchorage.
   ``I think I figured out where he bought the farm up there. There
was one area, on summit day, I was coming back down. It's very
steep, very exposed, and you feel that if you make one mistake, you
could die.''
   Tejas, a stocky 35-year-old with beard and shaved head, had
climbed McKinley 12 times, usually as a guide during the May-June
climbing season.
   Even then, in relatively milder conditions, about a third of
several hundred climbers who attempt the climb turn back short of
the summit.
   Snow-covered McKinley is infamous for hurricane-force winds that
rage for days, temperatures that dip to minus 60, and whiteouts
that make it hard to know up from down. Tejas' planned two-week
trek took a month.
   Tejas, who lives in Talkeetna, which is used as a staging area
for McKinley climbers, was dropped off Feb. 16 at the mountain's
7,200-foot level. On the second day, a storm came and kept him in
his snow cave for three days. He eventually went onto half rations,
then half rations every other day.
   ``I ended up working at my margin. It was around the edge of
safety several times.'' Twice, he found earlier climbers' food
caches that helped him survive. On March 7, he waited out a storm
and made a dash to the top during a whiteout.
   ``I couldn't see where I was going. After 12 times to the
summit, I can feel my way up to it, but it wasn't as pretty or
spectacular as I'd hoped for,'' he said.
   ``I took a few pictures, left a few mementos, turned around and
headed down. I left a Japanese flag in memory of Naomi Uemura, and
I also left a can of Spam. There was no meat in it. I ate it. I was
very hungry.''
   He made it back the same day to 17,000 feet and rested
overnight. The next day, he contacted pilot Lowell Thomas Jr. by
two-way radio and started down. Tejas appeared in good shape when
he arrived Tuesday in Anchorage, but he said the mountain had
pushed him to his mental, physical, and emotional limits.
   ``You go, `This is ridiculous. This is a hill, this is the
middle of winter, I'm a lone guy out here. There are crevasses all
around, there's danger. What am I doing here?' ''
   Safe on level ground, he answered his own question.
   ``To live in a very harsh environment, to do something very
stressful and straining like that, is a challenge,'' he said. ``I
was at the limits of my ability. It was a good test. I'd never
spent a month by myself. I found out I really liked myself.''

<HEAD>Robertson Scales Back Campaign, But Vows To Continue To Convention</HEAD>

   Republican Pat Robertson ran a distant
third in the Illinois primary but repeated his vow to continue his
campaign to the national convention.
   ``I am in all the way to New Orleans,'' Robertson said Tuesday
night, insisting that he was ``not a bit in the world
disappointed'' over the Illinois results.
   Robertson has spent nearly $25 million on a campaign that has
gained 17 national convention delegates, according to The
Associated Press tally. The federal spending limit for primary
campaigns is $27 million.
   Thus, Robertson acknowledged, he must run a drastically
scaled-back effort from here on.
   ``My own personal travel will continue but as far as a
full-blown media campaign, I can't afford that any more,'' he said
after meeting Tuesday afternoon with Republican National Committee
Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf
   But, he added: ``I have enough money to keep in the race through
...the convention.''
   Marc Nuttle, Robertson's campaign manager, said the exact amount
that could be spent before hitting the limit would not be known
before the next seven to 10 days.
   ``Whether it's between $2 million and $3 million or less than $2
million it will be enough for the campaign,'' he said.
   Richard Pinsky, national field director for Americans for
Robertson, characterized the new campaign as ``mean and lean. We
have always been labor-intensive and have won on organization and
grass-roots support from volunteers.''
   Robertson said he would campaign in California, which holds its
primary June 7, to help local candidates with their races.
   ``We would like to see Republican majorities enunciating major
conservative causes by 1990 or 1992,'' he said.
   Robertson said his meeting with Fahrenkopf was mainly to plan
the role of Robertson delegates in the convention.
   ``We talked about housekeeping things,'' he said.
   Nuttle said the talks were to ensure that the convention went
smoothly, and that Robertson's backers, many of whom have never
attended a national convention, are included in the preparation for
the event.
   ``Our goal is to unify the party,'' Robertson said. ``I am going
to be the conservative champion.''

<HEAD>Dole Vows To `Hang In There' Despite Illinois Defeat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bob Dole says his Republican presidential
campaign is still alive and ``we're just going to hang in there''
despite another crushing loss to George Bush.
   But the Kansas senator has been without a win for three weeks,
and the primary calendar offers him little hope: the next GOP
contest is March 29 in Connecticut, another one of the vice
president's home states.
   Dole returned home for a few days, flying into Washington as the
disappointing Illinois results began unfolding. Bush rolled up more
than half of the popular vote, and more importantly, held a 3-1
ratio in distribution of the 82 GOP delegates.
   Despite the bleak news, Dole told reporters, ``We're doing all
right. We're just going to hang in there. There's a long way to go
yet.''
   Pressed on whether he would continue his candidacy, he said,
``We're staying in, we're staying in.''
   Dole's campaign was stunned by Bush's 16-state sweep on Super
Tuesday, and he ordered massive staff layoffs and a halt to all
advertising in Illinois late last week. At the urging of some
aides, Dole considered giving up his White House hopes but decided
to stay in.
   He campaigned in Wisconsin and Connecticut as Illinois primary
voters went to the polls, saying: ``I don't give up very easily.''
   In Hartford, he said, ``This is called a surprise state from
time to time. We're ready for one. We could use it.''
   Dole hasn't had much to cheer about since Feb. 23, when he won
contests in South Dakota and Minnesota. A week before that, he was
surprised by Bush's come-from-behind win in New Hampshire, the
first signal of chaos in Dole's campaign.
   Little over a month ago, Dole was the early leader with his
impressive victory over Bush in Iowa.

<HEAD>Exit Polls Show `Little Chinks' in Bush's Armor Despite Big
Illinois Win</HEAD>

   Even as George Bush rolled up a victory in the
Republican primary in Illinois, exit polls indicated ``little
chinks in his armor'' that could bedevil him in the general
election, analysts say.
   Bush on Tuesday overwhelmed Sen. Bob Dole in virtually all
ideological and demographic groups of the Republican electorate,
cementing his huge lead in the GOP race.
   ``It's a blowout,'' said ABC News poll analyst Doug Muzzio.
   Results were far less clear on the Democratic side, where Sen.
Paul Simon cashed in on his favorite-son status and Jesse Jackson
rode another huge wave of black support to finish first and second
respectively in their home state.
   While Bush swamped his Republican opponents, his ratings on
leadership and toughness were weaker than may be expected from a
prohibitive front-runner, said NBC News poll analyst Sheldon
Gawiser.
   Additionally, Bush failed to win the independents who voted in
the GOP primary.
   ``If Bush is going to win the general election, he's got to
start attracting independent voters,'' said CBS News poll chief
Warren Mitofsky.
   The results did not foreshadow problems for Bush within the GOP;
he even won among former television evangelist Pat Robertson's
natural supporters, born-again Christians and voters concerned
about so-called ``morality issues.''
   But among the 23 percent of Republicans who said leadership was
a key issue, Dole and Bush split the vote, ABC found.
   ``A prohibitive front-runner should be showing some leadership,
particularly given the fact that he holds the second-highest office
in the land,'' Muzzio said.
   In NBC's poll, 55 percent of GOP voters said Bush was tough
enough to be a good president, but 24 percent said he was not and
21 percent were not sure. The 55 percent was ``a pretty small
number,'' considering that it came among Republican primary voters,
said Gawiser.
   Thirty 30 percent of Republicans told NBC that Bush would be a
very strong leader, 42 percent said he would be somewhat strong, 16
percent said not very strong, 6 percent said not at all strong and
6 percent didn't know. Again, ``That's not a terrific standing
among Republican primary voters,'' Gawiser said.
   In another measure, a plurality of Republican voters, 41
percent, said Bush had not fully disclosed his knowledge of the
Iran-Contra affair, while 32 percent said he had and 21 percent
were not sure, NBC found.
   While the issue has not been a significant one in the minds of
Republican voters, ``it's there,'' Gawiser said. ``That's a
tomorrow story,'' one that could gain significance in the general
election.
   These Bush results amounted to ``little chinks in his armor,''
not major campaign problems, Gawiser noted. Muzzio noted that the
flaws spotted in the ABC poll also were minor, with Dole beating
Bush among the tiny number of Republicans who rated ``honesty'' or
``getting things done'' as key.
   ``It doesn't tell us all that much about Bush's electability,''
Muzzio said. ``But it certainly indicates he's not a prohibitive
favorite to beat a Democrat.''
   In the Democratic race, weaknesses were demonstrated most
strongly by Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee, who failed to turn his
Super Tuesday victories into a sizable showing, and Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri, who finished last.
   ``The G-boys just didn't show,'' said Muzzio. ``They were
squeezed by the hometown favorites.''
   One favorite, Simon, even drew voters who doubt he can succeed.
ABC said just 40 percent of Simon's supporters gave him the best
chance to win in November, and 35 percent named Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis even though they voted for Simon. NBC said only 35
percent of Simon's voters thought he would win the nomination,
while 39 percent picked Dukakis to win it.
   Jackson enjoyed his now-customary huge black support: He
received 91 percent of the black vote, which was about a quarter of
the Democratic turnout, ABC said. But he won only 8 percent of the
white vote by ABC's count, 7 percent by the CBS News-New York Times
poll.
   ``Jackson still can't attract any white votes,'' said Mitofsky.
``He got 7 percent. And that's not enough.''
   Though Dukakis finished third, ABC said a plurality of
Democrats, 35 percent, thought he had the best chance of winning
the general election. Jackson had 27 percent, Simon, 18 percent.
   The margin of sampling error for the results was about 5 points
for most subgroups.

<TEXT>
   The House has given final congressional
approval to legislation authorizing prime federal parkland in
Washington for a national monument to the 5,000 black patriots who
served in the American Revolution.
   The voice vote by the House on Tuesday followed Senate approval
of the bill on Feb. 26.
   The House is expected to approve similar, Senate-backed
legislation today that would authorize a choice Washington site for
a national memorial to Americans who fought in the Korean War.
   Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J., said the Korean War memorial, to
be built on the mall that extends from the Lincoln Memorial to the
Capitol, will be ``a fitting and long-overdue monument to the
55,000 Amricans who lost their lives in a forgotten war.''
   Private sponsors say they have raised $2.5 million toward a goal
of $10 million for the Korean War memorial. The black patriots
monument, also expected to be built on the mall, will cost an
estimated $4 million.
   Both the black patriots and the Korean War monuments previously
were authorized by Congress, and will be built with private
donations.

<HEAD>Judicial Panel Says House Should Consider Impeachment of Judge
Nixon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of judges that makes policy for the
federal courts is urging the House to consider impeaching U.S.
District Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi, who is scheduled to
go to prison for perjury on March 23.
   The group, the Judicial Conference of the United States, on
Tuesday unanimously supported a resolution that says
``consideration of impeachment may be warranted.''
   Nixon, 59, was sentenced to five years in prison following his
1986 perjury conviction. He has remained a judge but has not been
hearing cases since he was indicted in 1985 although he continues
to be paid his annual salary of $89,500.
   Nixon would forfeit his salary and his eligibility for a pension
at age 65 if he is impeached by the House and removed from office
by the Senate.
   The recommendation that the House consider impeaching him was
approved by a vote of 24-0 by the judges' group. Three members
abstained, including Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who
traditionally does not vote on such matters.
   Nixon is the third federal judge ever to be indicted for crimes
allegedly committed while in office.

<HEAD>Panel Blames Flying Instructor in 1987 Utah Commuter Plane Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal panel has determined that the
primary cause of a 1987 collision that killed 10 people in Utah was
an instructor's failure to keep his plane out of restricted
airspace during a student training flight.
   The single-engine training plane collided with a SkyWest
commuter plane near Kearns, Utah, on Jan. 15, 1987, while making an
approach to Salt Lake City International Airport after a flight
from Pocatello, Idaho.
   The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday absolved the
air traffic controller handling the SkyWest plane. The other
aircraft was flying under visual flight rules and was not under the
direction of air traffic control.
   Nevertheless, the NTSB said the accident might have been avoided
if the private aircraft had equipment that would have provided the
controller information on the plane's altitude. Investigators said
the single-engine Mooney M-20C was on the radar screen, but without
altitude information the controller would not have known the two
planes were about to collide.
   The safety board put the primary blame for the accident on the
instructor of the private aircraft's ``lack of navigational
vigilance ... which led to the unauthorized intrusion'' into the
restricted airspace that surrounds the Salt Lake City airport.

<HEAD>US Official Urges End to Speeding Penalties For States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal official is telling Congress that
states whose drivers ignore the 55 mph speed limit should not be
penalized, but two senior lawmakers said they are writing bills
that would do just the opposite.
   Reps. James Howard, D-N.J., chairman of the House Public Works
and Transportation Committee, and Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., who
heads the Public Works surface transportation subcommittee, said
they are working on measures that would extend the penalties to
states that have adopted the 65 mph limit.
   States with 55 mph limits can lose up to 10 percent of their
federal highway aid if monitors find that more than half their
motorists are driving too fast. But when two laws were passed last
year allowing 65 mph driving on many rural highways, the penalties
were not extended to roads where states allow the faster speeds.
   ``The states are clearly in the best position to determine where
speed enforcement is needed to enhance safety,'' Diane K. Steed,
chief of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said
in a statement delivered Tuesday to Anderson's panel. ``They should
be able to deploy enforcement personnel accordingly, without the
threat of losing federal funds.''
   Lawmakers from the 11 states that have retained the 55 mph limit
have complained that it is unfair for their states to face the loss
of federal assistance while states that permit faster driving
cannot be penalized for motorists speeding on 65 mph roads.

<HEAD>Studies Say Changes Needed at VA, With or Without Cabinet-Level
Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent study group says significant
changes are needed in the way the Veterans Administration is being
managed whether or not it is elevated to Cabinet status.
   In its report to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, a
panel of the National Academy of Public Administration said it
found ``little evidence'' in its study that Cabinet-level status
would materially improve the VA's mission of providing for the
present and future needs of veterans.
   ``The panel does not believe that such an elevation would
significantly improve either access to the president, the adequacy
of necessary resources, or the organization, management and
delivery of high-quality services and benefits,'' the report said.
   The seven-member panel said it ``does recognize the potential
political value of raising the public visibility of the needs of
veterans and the programs designed to meet these needs by making VA
a department in the president's Cabinet. However, given the broad
political support which already exists for the VA and its programs,
the gain would be at the margin.''
   The academy panel and the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, did not make recommendations on
whether the VA should become part of the president's Cabinet.

   The U.S. dollar rose slightly in Tokyo trading
Wednesday, while stock prices rallied in heavy trading, ending the
day sharply higher.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which climbed 42.16 points Tuesday, closed the day
at 25,704.43 points, up 228.76 points, or 0.90 percent, from
Tuesday's close.
   The U.S. currency closed at 127.49 yen, up 0.24 yen from
Tuesday's close, after opening Wednesday at 127.38.
   Volume in the first section was estimated at a heavy 1.1 billion
shares, compared with 550 million shares traded Tuesday morning.
   Individual investors were active buyers of heavy industrials,
helping to absorb some selling of those issues by institutional
investors such as life insurance companies, traders said.
   The Nikkei average's previous closing high since the Oct. 19
market crash was 25,682.82 points on March 2.
   ``The yen is easing against the dollar...but everyone is waiting

   The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled Thursday to release

   An American communications satellite that was
launched last week has rocketed into geosynchronous orbit and
should start operations early in April.
   The Spacenet III satellite owned by GTE Corp. was launched
Friday night by a French Ariane rocket. On Tuesday, the satellite
fired its apogee kick motor, a small rocket engine, and moved into
orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, GTE officials said.
   Since the satellite is moving at the same rate of speed as the
earth, it will in effect hover over a point on the earth's surface.
   The 1,562-pound satellite provides a communications link between
points in all 50 of the United States. Clients include The
Associated Press and the television groups of ABC, CBS, CNN and
Gannett.
   The U.S. satellite and a French communications satellite were
launched together Friday from the European Space Agency launch site
in Kourou, French Guiana.
   GTE Spacenet is the first American client of Arianespace, the
operating arm of the European Space Agency.

   Susan Butcher, bundled against biting winds
and subzero temperatures, widened her lead and seemed assured of an
unprecedented third straight victory in the 1,150-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Butcher, who left this checkpoint just as her closest competitor
arrived Tuesday, was expected to cross the finish line in Nome
today.
   If Butcher wins, it will be the fourth consecutive year that a
woman has won the 16-year-old race. Libby Riddles of Teller won in
1985, and Butcher won in 1986 and 1987, setting a course record
each year.
   Butcher left Elim, 123 miles from Nome, at 5:11 p.m. Tuesday,
after stopping in the Eskimo village for two hours to feed and rest
her dog team. Martin Buser of Big Lake arrived two minutes before
she left.
   Butcher, a resident of Manley, took the lead early Tuesday and
has not yielded it. She left Elim with 10 of the 17 dogs she
started with March 5 in Anchorage; the others were dropped at
checkpoints along the trail.
   Buser was traveling with 12 of his original 20 dogs still in
harness.
   Subzero temperatures and biting winds continued to hinder the
leaders, and weather forecasters said the wind chill factor could
sink to minus 70 degrees along the trail's final miles.
   In each of her two previous victories, Butcher proved the
strength and endurance of her team in the final, windswept miles
along the barren Bering Sea coast. Her elapsed time last year was
11 days, 2 hours.
   Her closest rival last year was four-time Iditarod champion Rick
Swenson of Two Rivers, who ran neck-and-neck with Butcher until his
dogs refused to continue just 22 miles from the finish.
   This year, Swenson was about six hours behind Butcher at last
report, leaving Koyuk at 2 p.m. Tuesday in third place. Running in
fourth was Joe Garnie of Teller.
   Herbie Nayokpuk of Shishmaref was fifth. Seventy-year-old Joe
Redington of Knik, who took an early lead and held it for more than
400 miles, was sixth.
   Redington, known as the ``Father of the Iditarod'' for
organizing the first race in 1973, has run all but two races and
placed as high as fifth, but has yet to win.
   The first musher to Nome collects $30,000 of a $150,000 purse;
the next 19 finishers split the rest. Five of the 52 teams that
started the race have dropped out.

<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Until this week, almost no one had heard of Kon
Yu-Leung, reputed drug kingpin. He wasn't on any list of most
wanted criminals and he'd never been the subject of a crime
commission hearing or a newspaper story.
   Today, Kon is accused of leading a conspiracy to smuggle as much
as 1,000 pounds of Southeast Asian heroin into the United States,
far more than in such notorious cases as the ``Pizza Connection''
from Sicily and the ``French Connection'' through Marseilles.
   Authorities say they seized 570 pounds of the Kon network's
heroin. The head of the Drug Enforcement Administration's New York
bureau calls the amount ``almost mind-boggling'' compared with 200
pounds in the Pizza Connection and the 70 pounds in the French
Connection.
   Considered equally mind-boggling is the fact that such a huge
operator was not the agency's No. 1 target, as one prosecutor
claimed, but just one of several large Asian importers. They have,
according to authorities, increased their share of the city's
heroin business from 3 percent to 70 percent during the last five
years, displacing the Mafia.
   Despite the enormity of the 44-year-old Kon's alleged operation,
his rivals are expected to have no trouble supplying New York's
225,000 heroin addicts _ half the national total.
   And there will be more drug lords.
   ``Today's courier is tomorrow's king,'' Robert Strang, a DEA
spokesman, said Tuesday. ``That makes it difficult for law
enforcement. ... It's not like the traditional organized crime
families, where there's an organization with an observable
hierarchy.''
   ``Many people feel that because of this arrest we've solved the
Southeast Asia heroin problem,'' he added. ``We haven't. He's only
one of several major traffickers.''
   Kon, whom the police call Johnny Kon, was arrested Sunday night
outside the New York Hilton. He was wearing a $25,000
diamond-studded Piaget watch and a gold bracelet with a Buddha
charm, and carried $32 in a pocket of his dark business suit.
   Kon told the judge at his arraignment he could not afford to
hire a lawyer. He was held without bail in the federal jail in
Manhattan.
   Kon admitted to the agents who arrested him he was a smuggler _
of gems and cigarettes, authorities said.
   Investigators told a different story: that Kon may have imported
up to $1 billion in heroin into the United States between 1984 and
1987. He was described as a shadowy figure with a half-dozen
counterfeit passports in as many different names, who may have
bribed high officials in several nations.
   Money, apparently, is not one of his problems. The New York Post
reported that on a recent night Kon lost $1 million at a Manila
casino ``and walked out laughing.''
   Federal prosecutor Catherine Palmer described Kon as ``a big
spender. He enjoys big meals, good times and buying expensive
things for people.''
   Kon came to the DEA's attention in 1984, when a shipment of 250
pounds of heroin believed destined for the United States was seized
in Hong Kong harbor. Kon, a Shanghai-area native living in the
British colony, fled before he could be arrested, authorities said.
   Prosecutors said he owns about $20 million in real estate in
metropolitan New York and San Francisco and controls companies that
deal in furs, watches and tobacco.
   Police also arrested John Routollo, a former New York City
policeman who is accused of helping Kon distribute the drugs.
Strang said there was no evidence Routollo was associated with any
local crime groups.
   Palmer said Kon had been lured to the United States by a
``unique and highly creative'' ruse. But she would not elaborate
and it remained unclear why a major Asian trafficker would risk a
U.S. trip.
   ``He has to be here as well as in Southeast Asia to run his
business,'' Strang said. ``Major traffickers travel between Hong
Kong and New York City all the time, on a regular basis. We're
watching them.''

<HEAD>Thatcher Drives Home A Capitalist Revolution With Tax Cuts</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has
produced the most radical budget since it came to power nine years
ago, driving home a capitalist revolution with big tax cuts for the
wealthy.
   In Parliament on Tuesday, the rage of a frustrated opposition
boiled over into an unprecedented uproar. One member was expelled
and the session was twice suspended while Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson battled to deliver his budget speech.
   Labor Party outrage at the slashing of the top tax rate from 60
percent to 40 percent and Conservative government delight at
producing the first budget surplus for nearly 20 years underlined
the chasm between Britain's two major parties.
   It also signaled that Mrs. Thatcher, at her most confident since
winning a third five-year term last summer, does not plan on
yielding an inch to the opposition, or to more widespread pressure
to increase spending on the ailing National Health Service.
   Mrs. Thatcher gave what opposition leader Neil Kinnock called
``handouts to the rich'' in a society that critics charged is
increasingly polarized between the better off and the poor, between
depressed north and booming south.
   For the Conservatives, Tuesday was a high point and a
vindication of rigorous policies: the day Britain shrugged off
years of budget deficits and demonstrated it has combined the
fastest growth in Western Europe with low inflation and a budget
funded by the generation of wealth, not borrowing.
   ``The United States was able to achieve tax reform, but it
lamentably failed to achieve a balanced budget,'' said a jubilant
Lawson, the top Treasury official who presented the budget to the
House of Commons.
   ``What is a substantial achievement is to do both ... What I
have been able to tell you is a story of success. A story of the
transformation of Britain's fortunes.''
   The package contained what were widely regarded as the most
sweeping tax reforms in modern British history.
   Lawson replaced the previous six brackets of income tax rates
with just two, a new base rate cut to 25 percent from 27 percent,
and the top 40 percent rate, which is payable on income over
$35,700. The corporation tax was unchanged at 35 percent.
   In a single swoop, the British top tax rate fell to among the
lowest in industrialized nations, apart from the United States.
   Lower taxes are a cornerstone of Mrs. Thatcher's free-enterprise
policy, basic to encouraging business, keeping talent from fleeing
to tax havens and generating wealth and competitiveness.
   The government goal, Lawson said, is a 20 percent basic tax rate.
   When Mrs. Thatcher won power from a socialist administration in
1979 the basic tax rate was 33 percent and top rate 83 percent.
   Apart from doubling taxes on company cars, Tuesday's budget was
almost all good news for the well-off.
   For the Briton on average earnings of $23,125 a year, Tuesday's
tax cuts meant an extra $9.25 a week.
   For big earners, on $185,000 and up, savings began at $462.50 a
week.
   Across the TV news programs Tuesday night flashed the faces of
the even richer, such as retail chain store boss Sir Ralph Halpern
who'll be taking home nearly half a million dollars more a year
after the tax changes come into force in April.
   Amid jeers from the left and cheers from big business, there
were signs the Thatcher recipe will work again to allay resentment.
   ``We're In the Money, Folks'' Britain's biggest selling daily,
the 4-million circulation Sun, declared today. The Times of London
carried a banner headline, ``Lawson's Tax Triumph.''
   The budget announcement came just a month before a new
tightening up on welfare comes into force.
   Among others things, about 6 million low-income households will
lose all or part of rent subsidies because they have savings of
more than $11,100.
   And welfare payments to the poor for household items such as
kitchen stoves will be switched to loans.
   ``There never was a more obvious example of the rich getting
richer and the poor getting demonstrably poorer,'' said Labor's
finance spokesman, John Smith. ``It's an outrageous and disgusting
budget.''
   Retorted Tory legislator Peter Lilley, a treasury spokesman:
``You don't make the poor richer by making the rich poorer.''

   The study drew guarded praise from a critic of the theory,
because the findings attempt to explain why only certain creatures
became extinct and why the extinctions were gradual, not sudden.
   The asteroid impact theory differs from ones in which scientists
said such a collision caused mass extinction by kicking up enough
dust to block sunlight, plunging the planet into a freezing
darkness that killed plants, a source of food.
   California Institute of Technology planetary scientist John
O'Keefe and geophysicist Thomas Ahrens reached their conclusion by
analyzing experiments in which Ahrens and geophysicist Manfred
Lange shot steel bullets into rocks at 4,500 mph.
   Based on the amount of carbon dioxide released by the shattered
rocks, the scientists calculated that a 6-mile-diameter asteroid
hitting limestone or other carbon-rich rocks on Earth would have
released enough carbon dioxide to increase the amount of the gas in
the atmosphere two to five times.
   Such an increase in the gas, which traps solar heat like glass
in a greenhouse, could have caused a ``greenhouse effect'' that
warmed the planet by 9 to 36 degrees Fahrenheit for 10,000 years
after the asteroid struck, Ahrens said Tuesday.
   ``The leafy plants which dinosaurs ate were selectively
destroyed'' by the heat while other plants survived, Ahrens said.
``So there was probably (increased) competition for available food,
and eventually food supplies declined to a point where different
species, including the dinosaurs, became extinct in a
less-than-sudden manner.''
   Fossils show dinosaurs and other creatures became extinct
gradually, while many species survived. Many biologists and
paleontologists argue the mass extinction 65 million years ago was
caused by gradual climate change, not an asteroid or other sudden
catastrophe.
   William Clemens, paleontology chairman at the University of
California, Berkeley, and a leading critic of asteroid theories,
said he was skeptical of the O'Keefe-Ahrens theory because the
dinosaurs started to die earlier than 65 million years ago.
   But he called their study ``clearly a positive step'' because it
is consistent with gradual, selective extinction.
   O'Keefe will present the study Thursday in Houston at the 19th
Lunar and Planetary Science Conference.
   Scientists debating the dinosaurs' extinction fall into two main
camps: those who blame gradual climate change and those who blame
catastrophe. Catastrophe theorists disagree on whether an asteroid
or gigantic volcanic eruption was to blame.
   Geophysicist Charles Officer of Dartmouth College said he
believes the O'Keefe-Ahrens theory does not have merit because
geologic evidence supports the theory that volcanoes spewed enough
ash skyward to block sunlight and cause mass extinction.
   Geochemist Frank Kyte, of the University of California, Los
Angeles, disagreed, saying the theory that the asteroid triggered
greenhouse warming of the atmosphere is probably sound.
   While other scientists previously suggested the greenhouse
effect caused the extinctions, they said the carbon dioxide was
generated by volcanoes, changes in ocean circulation, or acid rain
that dissolved carbon-rich rocks.
   It is important to learn what killed the dinosaurs because ``it
behooves us to find out if we're just sort of sitting here awaiting
another (asteroid) impact to seal our doom, or if some of the
things we're doing to the environment might ... lead to the
extinction of many species,'' Clemens said.
   Scientists believe rising levels of carbon dixoide and other
greenhouse gases will warm Earth 3 to 5 degrees by the year 2050,
possibly causing crop-threatening droughts and partly melting polar
ice caps to raise sea levels and threaten coastal cities.
   Ahrens said an asteroid impact not only may have triggered
greenhouse heating, but possibly caused chemical reactions that
formed intense acid rain, which either killed many creatures
directly or wiped out their food plants. Clemens, however, wondered
how birds and other surviving species could have hidden from the
corrosive downpour.

Corruption</HEAD>

   Hundreds of prison guards here have engaged
in corruption including drug sales and aiding escapes, the district
attorney said in announcing the first nine arrests from a
continuing investigation.
   Authorities say seven guards, one prison cook and an inmate were
charged as a result of ``Operation Ferret,'' an investigation begun
18 months ago.
   ``The investigation will potentially yield the largest number of
arrests related to official misconduct by correctional officers in
this country's history,'' District Attorney Ronald Castille told a
news conference Tuesday.
   ``We are gathering the evidence to present to the special grand
jury that will lead to the arrest or discipline of hundreds of
guards over the coming months,'' Castille said.
   The crimes include selling drugs to inmates, bringing money and
other contraband into the city's five prisons and providing
handcuff keys to aid escapes, Castille said.
   ``The investigation will lead to the exposure and elimination of
a massive network of corruption and criminal activity among
self-serving Philadelphia prison employees and prison inmates,''
Castille said.
   Prison Superintendent Edward Lyons acknowledged that employees
targeted in the investigation will continue to guard inmates until
charged. He said the situation will pose no security problems.
   ``We have a sufficient number of employees to handle the
system,'' Lyons said. ``We have stepped up recruiting activities.
And as soon as charges are filed by the grand jury, we will suspend
and fire.''
   The prison system houses up to 9,000 inmates and employs 1,400
guards and 350 other workers.
   The two instances cited in the grand jury's report involved one
guard, the cook and an inmate in an escape and six guards in a
beating that hospitalized an inmate who reported a guard sleeping
at his post.
   Castille declined to say how many escapes guards allowed.
   Police Commissioner Kevin Tucker said a federally financed
Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network aided the investigation,
which according to Castille relied on undercover officers,
cooperating inmates and guards and electronic surveillance.
   Guard Dennis Tiest, 42; prison cook Stanley Suder, 37; and
inmate Kenneth Lynch, 39, were charged with helping inmate John
Longendorfer escape from the Laurel Hall minimum-security unit in
1987.
   Longendorfer, who was serving time for terroristic threats and
indecent assault, cooperated in the investigation, allowing
authorities to videotape the escape, according to court documents.
   Suder accepted a $1,000 bribe and a 1987 Pontiac Grand Am,
Castille said.
   The six other guards were charged with an unprovoked physical
assault on inmate William Kennedy on Feb. 16.
   Those charged were officers Edward Ricks, 32; Sammie Rogers, 41;
Clemon Davis, 35; Christ Taylor, 50; Charles Favano, 44; and Sgt.
Peter Jones, 50.
   Castille said the investigation of the assault uncovered other
reports of brutality.
   ``There is no question there is a serious problem within the
walls of the prisons, and with these arrests, starting now, we hope
to send out two messages,'' said Lyons.
   ``One, to those employees engaged in criminal activities that we
will find them and arrest them, and to those employees who
discharge their services with pride, we say to them that we need
you.''
   Other corruption cases in Philadelphia have resulted in the
conviction of 34 police officers since 1983 on federal bribery and
conspiracy charges. They included a deputy commissioner for
extorting money from vice figures. Twelve judges were suspended
last year for allegedly accepting cash from Roofers' Union members.
Three of the judges have been convicted of bribery in recent months.

   Sal Piro has seen the Rocky Horror Picture Show
1,100 times. Diane Witt has auburn hair 10 feet long when straight
_ tresses even Rapunzel would envy.
   They, and the world's fastest talker, were among the guests at
Tuesday's official reopening of the Guinness Book of Records'
spruced-up museum of ``amazing feats and astonishing facts'' in the
Empire State Building.
   Since 1977, 250,000 visitors a year have slaked their curiosity
at the museum, forking over an admission price of $3.50 for adults
and $2.50 for children, director Ken Volk said.
   At the reopening, boxer Thomas Hearns of Detroit was inducted
into Guinness for earning world titles in four weight classes.
   ``I'm a very proud man at this moment,'' he said. ``This is
something that my kids can look upon.''
   Around him, Guinness alumni toasted the renovation amid replicas
of the world's biggest produce (carrot, 15 pounds 7 ounces, I.G.
Scott, New Zealand, 1978) and videotapes of human feeding frenzies
(100 yards of spaghetti, 27.75 seconds), complete with sounds of
swallowing and belching.
   Calliope music wafted from the circus exhibit as Marilyn vos
Savant _ whose IQ of 228 made her the world's smartest person _
fielded reporters' highbrow questions about intellect, intuition
and upbringing.
   ``I really do enjoy the Guinness book,'' insisted Savant, who
attended on the arm of her husband, artificial heart inventor Dr.
Robert Jarvik. ``I like the idea of somebody out there being able
to be an authority without having any kind of message.''
   Savant and the others stood aside as Ms. Witt of Worcester,
Mass., unleashed 9 feet, 2 inches of auburn hair. She didn't get
the 30 minutes she needed to comb out the waves to reach her record
length of 10 feet.
   Fran Capo of Queens, fast talker extraordinaire, showed her
stuff with a rapid-fire Biblical passage. ``I save money on
long-distance bills,'' she noted.
   Bruce Block of Cincinnati, a record-holder for balancing 135
cigar boxes on his chin, gave a 5-second demonstration; and Albert
Lucas of Las Vegas tossed around four tennis rackets to show how he
seized the most Guinness records for juggling.
   Tom Harrington of Peekskill, leader of the World Domino
Spectacular Team, staged a topple. But Gary Stewart of Reading,
Ohio, on record for 130 pogo stick jumps, was there sans stick.
   Manhattan's Piro, who has seen the Rocky Horror Picture show
1,100 times, said, ``I only go twice a week. Some people go to the
same bar night after night.''
   In his spare time, Piro, a writer, goes to other movies, plays
chess and watches TV. He's seen the soap opera ``All My Children''
every day for five years.

   An Air Force captain's wife who is dying from
breast cancer that went undiagnosed by military doctors for almost
two years has won more than $1 million in damages from the
government.
   U.S. District Judge Joseph H. Young awarded Sandra M. Edwards,
34, of Camp Springs, and her husband, Bryan, $550,000 in
compensatory damages, $415,000 for lost earnings and $100,000 for
medical expenses she is expected to incur.
   ``Neither consoling words nor monetary damages can be expected
to fully compensate the truly grievous injury Mrs. Edwards
sustained and will continue to endure,'' the judge said in his
opinion, which was issued Friday.
   Mrs. Edwards, whose doctors have given her anywhere from a few
months to a year to live, said in court that she ``would like other
women to be aware'' of what happened to her.
   She said women who find breast lumps ``shouldn't be humiliated
by their doctors and shouldn't be embarrassed to get a second or
third opinion'' if they are unsatisfied with their diagnoses.
   Mrs. Edwards, a former civilian Navy employee and the mother of
a 3-year-old son, testified last month that she sought medical help
from military doctors in 1984 and 1985 after she felt a lump in her
right breast and experienced bleeding from the nipple.
   Both times, her male doctors gave her mammograms and blood
tests, but told her the lump was nothing to worry about, she said.
   One physician told her he thought she needed psychological help
because of her fears of the disease, she testified.
   A biopsy, ordered by a female military physician in late 1985
showed that the lump was malignant. She underwent a radical
modified mastectomy and reconstructive surgery in January 1986, at
the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda.
   She quit her job to recuperate and joined her husband in West
Germany, but the cancer reappeared. Last December, her doctors said
cancer had spread to her brain, liver and one lung.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Barbara S. Sale said in court that she
was not authorized by the Justice Department to admit liability,
but she did not defend against the malpractice charge.
   William O.P. Snead 3rd, the Edwards' lawyer, accused the
military doctors of ``conduct far outside minimally acceptable
standards.''

<HEAD>Hearing Set on GOP Delegate Slate Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hearing is set for today on whether the
delegate slates of Republican presidential candidates Pat Robertson
and Sen. Bob Dole should be on the primary ballot in all of New
York's 34 congressional districts.
   Supporters of the two GOP contenders filed a civil rights action
at federal court in Manhattan Monday, claiming that state election
laws violate the Voting Rights Act by making it unfairly difficult
for their candidates to compete for delegates in the April 19 New
York primary.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand scheduled the hearing on a
request by Dole and Robertson supporters that he should order
delegate slates for their candidates placed on the ballot in every
congressional district, pending the outcome of the lawsuit.
   Under state law, candidates had to get 1,250 signatures on
petitions from registered Republicans in each of the state's 34
congressional districts to get their delegate slates on the ballot.
All the signatures had to be gathered between Jan. 5 and Feb. 11,
1988.
   Only Vice President George Bush's campaign was able to
accomplish that and as a result, Bush slates are running unopposed
in about half the districts, according to the lawsuit.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis holds a
strong lead over Jesse Jackson according to results released from
last week's Democratic presidential precinct caucuses by Washington
state party officials.
   With about 68 percent of the precincts reporting the results of
last Tuesday's balloting, Dukakis had 45 percent, Jackson 35
percent, and 14 percent were uncommitted.
   All the other candidates were well off the pace, with Illinois
Sen. Paul Simon a weak fourth at 4 percent, Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. at 2 percent and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri with 1
percent.
   The Democratic Party made no effort to collect results statewide
on caucus night, gathering precinct returns slowly by mail instead.
   Republicans say it will be at least another week before county
chairmen submit the names of GOP delegates elected in last week's
precinct caucuses.

   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination has been endorsed by New York
state Assembly Majority Leader James Tallon.
   In making his announcement Tuesday, the Binghamton Democrat and
former chairman of the Assembly's Health Committee stressed Gore's
work on the federal Organ Transplant Act and his grasp of new
technologies.
   The Legislature's No. 1 Democrat, Assembly Speaker Mel Miller of
Brooklyn, has yet to endorse any of the Democratic candidates
although his wife is running in the state's April 19 presidential
primary as a prospective Gore delegate.
   ``I've been speaking to the Gore people more frequently than
anybody else, but I've not finally made a decision,'' said Miller.
   Also not taking sides yet is New York's top Democrat, Gov. Mario
Cuomo. Cuomo has said he doesn't know when, or even if, he will
endorse any of the Democratic candidates.
   Cuomo has bridled at suggestions that he's holding off an
endorsement because he's hoping a deadlocked national convention

<HEAD>Cuomo Task Force Proposes Election Day Registration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gubernatorial task force has proposed that
New Yorkers be allowed to register and vote on Election Day.
   Issuing a 94-page report Tuesday, the Governor's Task Force on
Encouraging Electoral Participation noted that Maine, Minnesota and
Wisconsin had ``experienced a substantial increase in voter
turnout'' after switching to such a system.
   The 17-member commission included officials from Gov. Marion
Cuomo's administration, the state Legislature, the New York State
and City boards of elections, college student representatives and
private citizens.
   The task force conducted a poll of 3,500 New Yorkers and talked
to focus groups. Cuomo said it had done all of that for ``less than
$20,000.''
   In the end, the task force came up with 30 recommendations to
get more New Yorkers to the polls by, among other things, allowing
college students to register to vote in their college communities
when they register for classes.
   The group also recommended that elementary and secondary schools
be required to offer classes that stress the importance of voting,
that public employees be allowed to assist New Yorkers in filling
out voter registration cards, and that the state create a permanent
state primary day. The state primary day has varied from summer to
fall during recent elections. It is scheduled for Sept. 8 this
year.

<HEAD>Professor to Study State Voting Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apathy often is blamed for low voter
turnouts, but the real reason people don't go to the polls may be
found in examining voter registration laws, says a University of
Michigan researcher.
   Many states have voter registration laws that discriminate
against the electorate by making it difficult to register, contends
political science Professor Steven J. Rosenstone, who is
coordinating a nationwide study of registration laws.
   Rosenstone said preliminary research suggests that modified
voter registration laws would increase overall voter turnout by
about 9 percent, bringing about 16 million more people to the polls.
   ``Blacks, Hispanics and the poor would benefit the most from the
changes,'' said Rosenstone, who is coordinating the nationwide
project funded by the Ford Foundation.
   In most states, voters have to register weeks before interest
peaks on election day, leave work early or travel an inconvenient
distance to the registration office, and finally, stand in a long
line, Rosenstone said.
   Almost half the 180 million eligible U.S. voters, including more
than half of the 20 million eligible black voters, aren't expected
to go to the polls in November, Rosenstone said.
   ``Contrast this situation to Canada, where registration
officials go door to door to make sure every eligible voter is on
the rolls. Their election-day turnout averages about 68 percent _
about 15 percent higher than in the United States,'' he said.

   A jury awarded $1.45 million to a man left
paralyzed from a 1985 wasp sting at an inn.
   The jury Tuesday awarded the money to Joseph Febesh, 68, after
finding the the Fox Hollow Inn of Woodbury liable for the sting
that within an hour put him into a three-week coma.
   Febesh, former manager of the golf program at the Doral Country
Club in Miami Beach, is unable to talk, feed himself or use his
arms and legs in any way at all, according to his lawyer Joseph
Napoli.
   Febesh's wife, Shirley, was awarded $250,000 for loss of her
husband's companionship and services.
   The Febeshes were at a 50th wedding anniversary party in the
garden of the inn when they noticed yellow jackets around the
garbage and the food. They told the head waiter, who shrugged off
the situation, Napoli said, and about an hour later Febesh was
stung in the hand.
   Napoli said the wasp's venom attacked Febesh's brain stem and
part of his spinal cord, putting him in a coma. He said Febesh,
paralyzed since regaining consciousness, is undergoing physical
therapy at a Miami hospital.
   The jury, after a 10-day trial before State Supreme Court
Justice Harold Baer, awarded $3.4 million to the Febeshes. The
court reduced the verdict by half after the jury found the couple
50 percent negligent.
   Lawyers for the inn argued that the Febeshes should have left
the area if they were worried about the yellow jackets.

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer, elected on the
promise of ending waste in government and changing Louisiana's
image of cronyism, dove headfirst into the state's financial
problems by ordering budget cuts and calling the Legislature into
special session.
   During his first full day in office Tuesday, Roemer also huddled
with legislative leaders, visited with foreign dignitaries and took
time out to pose for his official portrait.
   Roemer went to work on measures to solve the fiscal crisis
immediately after his Oct. 24 election victory over Gov. Edwin
Edwards and said Tuesday included ``more of the same.''
   ``I really feel like I've been doing this for 100 days,'' he
said at a news conference. ``I feel the same. I'm still feel
excited about it after 24 hours. I feel good getting into the
substance of it.''
   Just hours after he was inaugurated Monday, Roemer turned down a
stay of execution for Wayne Felde, convicted of killing a
Shreveport police officer in 1978. Felde died in the electric chair
shortly after midnight.
   While Roemer settled into his new job, former officials of the
Edwards administration jammed the three main elevators in
Louisiana's skyscraper Capitol, moving out boxes of personal
belongings.
   Roemer ordered $7.9 million in immediate spending cuts and
summoned the Legislature into a 10-day special session next Monday
to consider government reorganization and giving him emergency
power to cut spending through the rest of the fiscal year without
lawmakers' approval.
   The largest of the new cuts include $2.6 million from the
Department of Health and Human Resources, $2.2 million from the
Department of Public Safety, and about $1.1 million from the
vocational education system.
   Louisiana faces an accumulated four-year budget deficit and cash
shortfall of $1.2 billion.
   The governor can cut up to 20 percent from any budget unit
without legislative approval. Roemer said one idea under
consideration was asking for the power to cut up to 20 percent from
an entire agency and eliminate entire state programs.
   The governor also said he was developing other executive orders
to save the state 10s millions of dollars, primarily through budget
cuts that Edwards refused to impose at Roemer's request.
   ``We are in a position in this fiscal year where the numbers
drive the policy and not the policy driving the numbers,'' Roemer
said. ``When this state is busted, broke, when the deficit is
approaching a number too large to comprehend, the numbers are
driving this now.''
   To alleviate a cash-flow deficit that threatens to shut down
state government, about $156 million in additional cuts from the
state's $5.3 billion budget will have to be found, Roemer said.
   Edwards approved about $36 million in reductions before leaving
office and Roemer's budget team plans to delay state payments to
retirement systems, hold up income tax refund checks and push one
state payday into the next fiscal year to conserve cash.
   Roemer has said new taxes probably will be needed to overcome
the budget deficit. However, he said that topic would not be
considered during the special session.
   Roemer met Tuesday with representatives of the government of
Taiwan about the possibility of building an industrial plant in
Louisiana. After Monday's inauguration, the governor met with
business representatives from Japan and Nigeria.

   Military authorities today announced
the arrests of nine suspected Communist guerrillas, two of them
regional party officials, in the latest blow to the crippled
insurgency.
   The arrests were made March 9-14 in three northeastern
provinces, said Maj. Praphan Suvannamajo, an Internal Security
Operations Command spokesman.
   The impoverished northeast was once the stronghold of the
Communists, who fielded about 12,000 fighters at the peak of power
in the late 1970s.
   A government amnesty offer and military raids have crippled the
insurgency, and the army says just a few hundred guerrillas remain.

   The financially troubled De Laurentiis
Entertainment Group Inc. has agreed to sell the foreign TV, video
and non-theatrical rights to virtually its entire 320-movie library
for $69 million.
   The foreign rights are being acquired by a newly formed United
Kingdom company controlled by financier Michael W. Stevens, the De
Laurentiis company said Tuesday.
   The sale will pay off $57 million in bank debt and provide
capital for the company, which posted a $36.2 million loss in the
first nine months of the last fiscal year.
   The company's founder, Italian filmmaker Dino De Laurentiis, 68,
stepped down as chairman and chief executive last month. The
company still seeks a buyer for remaining library rights and its
vast Wilmington, N.C., studio.

   The cat's out of the bag. Fustuce
Ringgenberg, better known as Fred, proud recipient of a letter
offering him a MasterCard from an Ohio bank with a $5,000 limit,
hasn't worked a lick in his 2{ years.
   Janet Ringgenberg said she was flabbergasted that her cat got a
pre-approved invitation. Ms. Ringgenberg said she has been trying
unsuccessfully to get a credit card since she was divorced three
years ago.
   ``Where's he going to go with it?'' she asked. ``He doesn't even
leave home, let alone leave home without it,'' she said with a
smirk. ``It's hilarious. I think it's just a big joke.''
   Fustuce mostly lies on the rug or nestles in the easy chair, she
said. His biggest worry is whether he'll get canned tuna.
   The story probably began a year ago, when Ringgenberg's
18-year-old daughter, Barbara, filled out a questionnaire on
toothpaste and breakfast cereal and mailed it in with Fustuce's
name on it.
   ``I thought they'd send us some free coupons or something,'' Ms.
Ringgenberg said. Instead, Fustuce's name apparently ended up on a
mailing list bought by Credit Card Service Bureau of Springfield,
Va., to solicit customers.
   Betty Rothgeb, administrative assistant to the company's
chairman, said household pets get on the list of prospective
customers ``from time to time.''
   ``There's no danger he (Fustuce) is going to be given a credit
card,'' Ms. Rothgeb said. ``Obviously, since the cat has no credit,
it would be denied.''

   Creditors in Vermont cannot take a
person's two-horse wagon, pew in church, lettered gravestone or
year's worth of yarn in personal bankruptcy proceedings.
   Cars, refrigerators and other items considered modern
necessities, however, are not protected by law from creditors. A
bill under consideration in the state Senate would add those modern
inventions and eliminate antiquated items from the list of
protected property.
   The bill received preliminary approval Tuesday.
   ``There was a judicial case that said sorry, a car is not an ox
cart,'' said Kirby Scarborough, chairman of the Vermont Bar
Association's bankruptcy committee, which unanimously endorsed the
revision. ``Let me ask you something, who has an ox cart these
days?''
   State archivist Gregory Sanford said the Legislature responded
to changing state economies, adding an exemption for sheep in 1811
and for bees and honey in 1850, but the list went unchanged for
most of this century.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian soldiers shot and killed at
least 24 Tamil rebels during search operations in two northeastern
districts, a Sri Lankan military official said today.
   The official, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said the operations in the Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi districts
began early Tuesday and lasted the entire day. He said eight of
those killed were women and that at least four rebels were injured.
   More than 300 Indian soldiers backed by helicopter gunships and
tanks were involved in the operation, the official said.
   The search operations follow the killing of members of the
majority Sinhalese community, allegedly by the rebels, in
neighbouring Trincomalee district and retaliatory killings of
Tamils by an outlawed Sinhalese group. At least 98 people have died
in Trincomalee in the past two weeks.
   The official said the Indians also had searched unsuccessfully
for members of the People's Liberation Group, an ultra-nationalist
Sinhalese organization.
   At least 50,000 Indian soldiers are in Sri Lanka to disarm Tamil
rebels, who have been waging a separatist guerilla war since 1983.
The Indians were deployed under a peace accord which granted
limited autonomy to the minority Tamils in exchange for an arms
surrender.
   But the Tamils renounced the July 29 accord last fall and since
then they have been battling the Indian soldiers.
   The People's Liberation Front also opposes the peace accord,
saying it grants too many concessions to the Tamils.
   India says more than 400 soldiers and at least 1,100 rebels have
died in the fighting, but the militants claim that most of the
Tamils killed were civilians.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people while
the Sinhalese comprise 75 percent. Tamils say they are
discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who control the army and
the government in Sri Lanka.

   An engine fire broke out early today on a cruise
ship carrying more than 700 people in the Gulf of Mexico, but the
blaze appeared to have been brought under control, according to
officials and a nearby ship's captain.
   No injuries were reported, said Petty Officer Brian Lincoln, of
the U.S. Coast Guard's Miami office.
   The Scandinavian Star was about 35 miles off Isla Mujeres, a
Mexican island north of the tourist resort Cancun in the Yucatan
peninsula, said Coast Guard Lt. Jim Mazzonna in Miami.
   ``All we know is that the ship's captain ... is completely out
of fire-fighting equipment and has requested additional
fire-fighting equipment such as foam, water and CO2,'' said
Lincoln, referring to carbon dioxide.
   Coast Guard cutters, the Canada Star cruise ship and the vessel
Vera Cruz stood by to assist in evacuating passengers, Lincoln said.
   The Canada Star's captain, Jens Thorn, said later that the fire
appeared to have been brought under control, and there was no
reason to evacuate.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Richard Esterline said 707 people,
including crew, were aboard the ship.
   The Scandinavian Star, owned by SeaEscape Ltd., offers daily
``cruises to nowhere'' out of its port in St. Petersburg, records

   Two Lebanese newspapers today published
letters addressed to kidnapped American journalist Terry Anderson
and his pro-Iranian captors on the third anniversary of his
abduction in Moslem west Beirut.
   The independent An-Nahar and the Sunni Moslem Al-Liwa also
published a picture of Anderson's 2-year-old daughter Sulome, who
was born after his March 16, 1985, abduction by Islamic Jihad.
   ``Here is Sulome, our daughter, wishing you a safe return home,
daddy,'' said a letter to Anderson from Madeleine, Sulome's mother.
   ``She often asks about you. Wondering which of all the planes
she is seeing will be the one bringing daddy home...,'' the letter
said.
   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held of 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon. There
has been no word of him for three months.
   In a letter to the Shiite Moslem kidnappers, the U.S.-based
Journalists' Committee To Free Terry Anderson pleaded with Islamic
Jihad to ``release him in the name of humanity.''
   ``For what crime is he paying this terrible price?'' the letter
asked. ``Terry has committed no crime.''
   The letters were also broadcast by a state-run television
station based in Christian east Beirut, as well as the Christian
Voice of Lebanon and the Sunni Voice of Nation radios.
   Anderson was seized before kidnappings became epidemic in Moslem
west Beirut, when many foreigners lived there. Gunmen believed to
be Shiite Moslem zealots abducted him as he was returning home from
a game of tennis.
   Police say they have no information on Anderson or any of the
other missing foreigners, who include eight other Americans. Most
are held by Shiite Moslems loyal to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
the revolutionary patriarch of Iran.
   Lebanese government authorities have little sway in their own
country after 13 years of civil war that pits Moslems against
Christians and rival factions within each camp against each other.
   Anderson's captors call themselves Islamic Jihad, which means
Islamic Holy War. Since his abduction, they have released nine
photographs and two videotapes of him.
   He is known to have been allowed to write to his family once, in
November 1985. In his last videotaped message, delivered to a news
agency in Beirut on Christmas Eve, Anderson addressed the Reagan
administration and his family.
   ``To my government, I don't know what to say,'' he declared.
``To my family, I love you and miss you very much. ... I am in good
health but tired and very lonely.
   ``Mr. President, I say again this cannot continue. There is a
limit for how long we can last and some of us are approaching their
limit. ... Surely by now you know what must be done and how you can
do it.
   ``This is difficult, but you can do it. There have been enough
careful consideration, cold discussion and enough secret
maneuvering.''
   Services were planned in Washington today to commemorate
Anderson's three years in captivity. Participants at the Holy
Trinity Church were to include three former hostages _ Revs.
Lawrence Jenco and Benjamin Weir and ABC News correspondent Charles
Glass.
   Prayers for Anderson and the other hostages were to be offered
by Christian and Islamic clergy. Participants were to read passages
from the Bible and the Koran before 1,000 olive branches are given
to the attendees.
   In Washington, Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., asked her
colleagues in the House of Representatives and all Americans to
take a moment ``to think about the continuing plight of Terry
Anderson and the other hostages in Lebanon.''
   ``As Terry begins his fourth year of deprivation and inhumane
isolation ..., let us reflect on the toll three years of separation
from our wives, children, parents and brothers and sisters would
take on each of us,'' said Ms. Slaughter, who represents Anderson's
sister, Peggy Say, in Congress.
   Islamic Jihad has demanded the release of 17 comrades imprisoned
in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in December
1983 as ransom for Anderson and Thomas Sutherland, 56, another
American they hold.
   Kuwait has refused and the United States has rejected demands
from the kidnappers that it bring pressure to bear on the sheikdom.
   Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   Two other Americans kidnapped by Islamic Jihad kidnapped the
same year were freed in 1986 _ Jenco, 50, a Roman Catholic priest,
and David Jacobsen, 54, director of the American University
Hospital. They were held with Anderson and Sutherland.
   There have been no publicized efforts to free missing Americans
since the disappearance Jan. 20, 1987, of Anglican Church envoy
Terry Waite, who left his west Beirut hotel that day for a meeting
with Anderson's captors.
   Waite has been missing since, but no group has claimed to have
kidnapped him. He had made several trips to Beirut seeking release
of the Americans. The final one was his first after disclosure that
the United States secretly shipped arms to Iran in an effort to
free the captives.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm from Nevada to Kansas today left up to 6 inches of snow,
while freezing temperatures shattered record lows and threatened
crops in the Deep South.
   Nearly clear skies with light winds helped temperatures drop
throughout the South. By midnight, frost was scattered across
Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi into northern Florida.
   More than 40 cities tied or broke records for low temperatures
on Tuesday. Today, Apalachicola, Fla., had a record low of 39
degrees, one degree colder than the mark set on the same date in
1954. At midnight Tuesday, Tallahassee hit 28 degrees.
   Georgia peach growers were worried about the freezing weather's
effect on the state's crop of an estimated 140 million pounds.
Temperatures of 28 degrees or below can damage peaches in their
early stages.
   ``We don't need cold now,'' said Stephen Myers, a horticulturist
with the University of Georgia Extension Service in Athens.
   In Florida, a forecaster said citrus trees could withstand the
cold, but vegetables that are just weeks away from harvesting are
vulnerable to frost damage.
   ``Definitely, we're in a critical period,'' Larry Pfeiffer, a
specialist with the National Weather Service in Ruskin, said,
referring to central and south Florida vegetables.
   In the West, up to 6 inches of snow fell on Fillmore, Utah, and
heavy snow also was reported over Spanish Fork Canyon and the
Brianhead ski area in southern Utah.
   Snow continued this morning across Wyoming, northern Nevada,
northwestern Montana, northern Minnesota, Michigan, the Ohio
Valley, New York state and northern New England.
   Snowfall during the six hours ending at 1 a.m. EST included 6
inches at Lander, Wyo., 3 inches at Mount Washington, N.H., and 1
inch at Charleston, W.Va.
   High wind warnings were posted over southeast Kern County in
Southern California.
   Today's forecast called for snow extending from eastern Nevada
and northern Arizona across the Rockies into central Kansas. Snow
should be scattered over the Great Lakes, the upper Ohio Valley and
New England. Highs should be in the 20s and 30s from the northern
and central Rockies to New England. Temperatures should warm into
the 50s across much of the south-central and southeastern portion
of the nation. Highs are expected in the 60s in southern and
central Texas, much of Louisiana and the Florida peninsula.
Temperatures also should warm into the 50s and 60s across the West
Coast, the Southern Plateau and the southern half of New Mexico.
Highs in the 70s were expected in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 4
degrees at Bismarck, N.D., and Rapid City, S.D., to 66 at Phoenix,
Ariz.

   Confusion and fear generated by AIDS has
created an unlimited audience for quacks who are expected to take
in $1 billion this year, speakers at the National Health Fraud
Conference said.
   ``Many persons who have AIDS will try anything to defeat it;
many who don't have AIDS will try anything to avoid it,'' said Dr.
John H. Renner, director of the National Health Information Center
in Kansas City. ``That makes it easy for quacks to convert every
trick in their repertoire into an AIDS treatment or preventative.''
   Dr. Robert E. Windom, assistant secretary for health of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, called Tuesday for health
professionals to join in an anti-fraud effort.
   Renner said he's seen fraudulent AIDS remedies that include
processed pond scum, hydrogen peroxide injections, the food
preservative BHT, pills derived from AIDS-infected mice and
``herbal'' capsules containing poisonous metals.
   ``We've even discovered a phony doctor who, for a $100 fee, was
injecting his patients with a processed byproduct of their own
urine,'' he said.
   About 400 people attended the two-day conference on health
fraud, including representatives of law enforcement agencies,
consumer groups, medicine, insurance companies and business.
   Michael R. Botwin, a California deputy attorney general, said it
was understandable that people faced with AIDS would try any
treatment, and that it some cases quack treatments provided a
psychological boost.
   ``However, many so-called AIDS treatments are sold with scare
tactics, pose health hazards, or carry the risk of substantial
financial loss,'' he said.

Gun</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tape recordings indicate President
Corazon Aquino's husband was killed with a gun other than that
which officials claim was the murder weapon, a Japanese sound
expert testified today.
   Based on the tapes of voices, footsteps and gunfire, Matsumi
Suzuki also identified four soldiers as the ones who shouted the
Tagalog words ``This is it,'' ``Let me do it'' and ``Shoot''
seconds before former Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr. was shot and killed
on Aug. 21, 1983.
   Suzuki, president of the Japan Acoustics Institute of Tokyo,
made the statements at the trial of 34 soldiers and three civilians
accused of murdering Aquino and Rolando Galman, an alleged
communist agent initially tagged as the assassin.
   Aquino was killed as he walked down the stairway from a China
Airlines plane to the tarmac at Manila airport under military
escort. He was returning to the Philippines from three years' exile
in the United States. Galman was shot and killed by soldiers
immediately after Aquino fell.
   Suzuki, speaking in Japanese through an interpreter, said he
reached his conclusions after analyzing sounds picked up by
journalists' tape recorders during the assassination and the test
firing of various types of guns in studios in Japan and the United
States.
   Chief prosecutor Raul Gonzales told reporters that Suzuki's
testimony supports the prosecution's claim that Aquino was shot on
the stairway, where only soldiers were in a position to shoot him
in the back of the head.
   The military under deposed President Ferdinand Marcos claimed
Aquino was shot by Galman on the tarmac with a .357-caliber Magnum
revolver.
   In his testimony, Suzuki said an analysis of the tape recordings
show that the first shot, which has been established as the one
that killed Aquino, could have come only from a .45-caliber pistol.
   ``The sound of the gunshot was close to the sound of a
.45-caliber automatic pistol,'' Suzuki said. ``The sound was quite
different to a great degree from the sound coming from a .357
Magnum.''
   Suzuki said the sound of the footsteps of Aquino and his four
soldier escorts were clearly picked up by two boom microphones
extended over the top of the stairway, as the party began
descending.
   ``We can clearly analyze the sound of the first step to the
eleventh step,'' Suzuki said referring to the stairway, which had
21 rungs. ``After the eleventh step ... the sound of gunfire was
heard.''
   Suzuki said he could not pinpoint the step where Aquino was shot
but calculated it was between the 11th and 15th rungs.
   The tapes also picked up the words ``Eto na'' (This is it),
followed by ``Ako na. Ako na'' (Let me do it. Let me do it) and
``Pusila. Pusila.'' (Shoot. Shoot.)
   Suzuki said the words ``Eto na'' were uttered by Lt. Jesus de
Castro, chief of the security detail assigned to Aquino, who
remained at the top of the stairs while Aquino was led down.
   The words ``Let me do it'' were said by Sgts. Claro Lat and
Arnulfo de Mesa one after the other, Suzuki said.
   He said the fatal gunshot came after both Castro and Constable
1st Class Mario Lazaga shouted ``Shoot!'' one after the other.
   Suzuki said he identified the voices by comparing voice prints
on the tapes with tape-recorded statements made by soldiers during
a formal investigation shortly after the murder. A five-member
board had required all the soldiers who escorted Aquino to say
those words.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas businessman and prominent
Democratic Party fund-raiser with ties to House Speaker Jim Wright
has been indicted by a federal grand jury in an alleged land fraud.
   Thomas Merrill Gaubert of DeSoto, Texas, was accused Tuesday of
pocketing $5.6 million of $8 million he persuaded the Capitol
Federal Savings and Loan Association into investing in a
condominium project he was developing in Texas.
   The Mount Pleasant, Iowa, savings and loan was closed in May,
when federal regulators said its Texas investment and other poorly
secured loans had left the company with a negative net worth of $65
million.
   Gaubert, 48, former owner of the Independent American Savings
Association in Irving, Texas, contributed $7,000 to two Wright
political committees in 1985.
   In the fall of 1986, Wright, D-Texas, then House majority
leader, arranged a 2{-hour meeting between Federal Home Loan Bank
Board Chairman Edwin Gray and Gaubert to air Gaubert's complaints
about his S&L's treatment by the board.
   Wright said he was simply encouraging Gray to ensure that his
agency was being fair to one of Wright's constituents.
   Gaubert is accused of using the S&L to finance a ``land flip''
in a Dallas County, Texas, condominium project he was developing in
1982 and 1983.
   Gaubert bought about 44 acres of land about 11 miles south of
downtown Dallas at less than 50 cents per square foot, then sold it
the same day through a middleman to 22 buyers at $5.25 per square
foot, the indictment alleged.
   He is accused of not telling Capitol Federal officials that he
owned the land and planned to sell it to investors at inflated
prices.
   The indictment charges Gaubert with three counts of wire fraud
and one count of making false statements to a federally insured
financial institution.
   ``I am confident that I will be vindicated,'' Gaubert said
Tuesday. ``The transaction in the indictment occurred five years
ago and all of the funds initially borrowed from Capitol Savings
were repaid in 1985.''
   No arraignment date has been set for Gaubert.
   The S&L industry in Texas, which leads the nation in losses and
failures, is the focus of a huge federal criminal investigation
that has led to a number of indictments of prominent businessmen.
   The maximum penalty for wire fraud is a $1,000 fine and five
years in prison. Making false statements to a federally insured
financial institution carries a maximum $5,000 fine and two years
in prison.

   Voters in the Illinois primary stopped a
political comeback by former Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne and set up a
congressional rematch between House Minority Leader Bob Michel and
his 1982 challenger.
   Mrs. Byrne lost her race Tuesday for the Democratic nomination
for clerk of the circuit court in Cook County to Aurelia Pucinski,
who was endorsed by the county party organization. With 92 percent
of the vote in, Mrs. Byrne trailed Mrs. Pucinski 53 percent to 38
percent.
   ``It means that when the people spoke, they apparently shouted.
... I am very good at taking hints,'' said Mrs. Byrne, loser of two
previous bids to regain the mayor's office she lost in 1983 to
Harold Washington.
   Asked whether she would consider running for office again, she
said, ``I'm not even thinking of it right now.''
   Edward Vrdolyak, a former Democratic power broker who left the
party, was unopposed on the Republican side and will face Mrs.
Pucinski in November.
   The highlight of Illinois' 22 congressional district races
Tuesday was in Peoria where House Minority Leader Bob Michel
crushed his first primary opponent in 32 years to set up a November
rematch with attorney G. Douglas Stephens, the Democrat who almost
unseated him in a bitter 1982 race.
   Southern Illinois Democrats chose a nominee who never finished
college and doesn't hold a law degree for an Illinois Supreme Court
vacancy. Appellate Justice Horace Calvo of Glen Carbon, who
attended college and law school but never earned a degree, won the
nomination with 34 percent of the 49,817 votes cast.
   Chicago voters in precincts around Wrigley Field, the only major
league stadium without night baseball, voted three-to-one in a
non-binding referendum against the City Council's decision to add
lights to the historic home of the Cubs.
   In a citywide non-binding referendum, voters advised against
sending Illinois National Guard troops to train in Central America.
   Michel, President Reagan's point man in Congress, easily
defeated Tazewell County Board chairman James E. Unsicker. With 96
percent of the votes counted, Michel had 86 percent to Unsicker's
14 percent.
   Stephens coasted through the Democratic primary, receiving 88
percent of the vote to Justin Zachary West's 12 percent.
   In the 21st Congressional District, where retiring Democratic
Rep. Melvin Price has served for 44 years, St. Clair County Board
Chairman Jerry F. Costello won a four-man race for the Democratic
nomination. He'll face Republican Robert H. ``Bob'' Gaffner in
November.
   In the 22nd District, state Sen. Glenn Poshard of Carterville
will carry the Democratic standard in November against Republican
Patrick J. Kelley of Carbondale. The two are vying to succeed
retiring Rep. Kenneth Gray, who served 12 terms in two Capitol Hill
stints since 1955.
   Tuesday's primary also saw the return of followers of political
extremist Lyndon LaRouche on the ballot for a range of positions
from president to county register of deeds. Unlike two years ago
when two LaRouche candidates were nominated for lieutenant governor
and secretary of state, none of the candidates succeeded.

   Voters soundly defeated a proposal
to change the town's name to Sleepy Hollow, a historic moniker made
famous by the Washington Irving story of the Headless Horseman.
   The vote Tuesday was 1,322 against the name change and 794 in
favor, said Alison Fine, a village trustee.
   Sleepy Hollow was the 17th century Dutch description of the
Hudson River area north of New York City.
   Advocates of the name change said the village of 8,000 was too
often confused with neighboring Tarrytown and needed a new image to
attract business and tourist money. Opponents said changing the
name would cause more confusion and might cost more than $50,000.
   Stacy Kelly, a member of the Sleepy Hollow Committee, said she
was disappointed, but added, ``we raised the consciousness of
people here that we need a long-term vision for the village.''

<HEAD>UT Astronomer Finds Light `Echo'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A University of Texas astronomer has observed the
first ghostly light ``echoes'' from Supernova 1987A, an exploding
star that lighted the southern skies in February 1987, the
university announced.
   Arlin Crotts made the observations at the Carnegie Institution
of Washington's Las Campanas observatory in Chile, the university
announced Tuesday.
   Theories predict that when a supernova explodes, some light from
the flash would light up or reflect off dusty clouds of gas and
show up as faint arcs of light long after the peak brightness of
the supernova.
   Until now, however, no supernova has been close enough and
bright enough to test this prediction, UT spokesman Danny Ewald
said.
   Crotts found two arcs of light corresponding to echoes from
supernova 1987A. The echoed light should be that which was emitted
when the supernova was at its brightest, some 80 days after the
explosion was detected.
   Crotts said the discovery of the light echo from supernova 1987A
was confirmation of a basic prediction on how a supernova should
behave.
   The echo is useful for mapping the clouds of gas and dust that
surround the supernova, much as terrain-mapping radar gives
information on and contours, UT said in a statement announcing the
discovery.
   According to scientists, previously observed supernovae have
been so far distant from Earth that light echoes were
undistinguishable from the source, and the later-arriving light was
misinterpreted as slower decay of the supernova.

<HEAD>Dissidents Jailed So They Could Not Take Part In Anti-Government
Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities today announced the release
of eight opposition leaders jailed while 10,000 anti-government
demonstrators marched through Budapest in Hungary's largest street
protest since the 1956 uprising.
   The state news agency MTI said writer Miklos Haraszti and the
other seven were detained for ``intenting to disturb'' Tuesday's
ceremonies commemorating the 140th anniversary of Hungary's
rebellion against Austrian rule.
   After a Communist Party-organized demonstration on Tuesday, the
protesters marched down the capital's main boulevards shouting
``Democracy'' and chanting slogans demanding a free press and free
elections.
   Police turned out in force but did not disturb the march.
   Speakers at a rally after the march criticized the Soviet system.
   ``The time is over for self-appointed governments,'' leading
dissident Gabor Miklos Tamas told the crowd, referring to the
nation's Communist authorities. ``A modern democracy has to be
created with a new constitution and free elections.''
   Haraszti, reached by telephone from Vienna today, said he and
the other dissident intellectuals were taken to the Gyuejtoefoeghaz
prison outside Budapest, where Imre Nagy, premier during the 1956
revolution, was executed.
   ``I was picked up by police at 5 a.m. and set free around
midnight,'' Haraszti said. ``We were all held in separate cells.''
   Haraszti said that, in days preceding Tuesday's anniversary,
authorities launched a campaign to try to discourage young people
from taking part.
   In an attempt to keep the number of demonstrators low, he said,
police searched houses, seized underground literature and visited
high schools, apparently to intimidate students.
   He said he did not think any of the dissidents detained Tuesday
had been fined or charged.
   The others are sociologist Ottilia Solt, publisher Gabor
Demszky, artist Tamas Molnar, Gyoergy Gado, Jenoe Nagy and two
lesser known dissidents, Sandor Racz and Robert Palinkas.
   On Tuesday, the crowd marched to monuments to national heroes,
paying particular tribute to firebrand poet Sandor Petoefi, whose
name is symbolic of resistance to foreign domination of Hungary.
   A 1948 rebellion in Hungary was put down a year later with the
help of Russian troops. In 1956, Soviet troops again helped
suppress a nationalist uprising.
   Hungarian dissidents have staged unofficial demonstrations on
March 15 every year since 1973. Police generally have shown
restraint, although dozens of officers clashed violently with
protesters in 1986.
   Roza Demszky, wife of the detained publisher, read her husband's
speech to the crowd. The Soviet system has led Hungary into a
crisis ``and does not show any way out,'' she said.
   Hungary recently has imposed an austerity program to try to
reverse economic stagnation.

<HEAD>Man Leaves $5 Million Estate To Orchid Society</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former auto-parts salesman whose
collection of orchids was among the world's largest has died,
leaving his $5 million estate and its nearly 12,000 orchids to the
American Orchid Society.
   Lewis Vaughn died Monday at age 92.
   ``It's just kind of special to see a man's life turned into such
beauty and love,'' said Pat Pepper Schwab, the city's vice mayor.
   ``He was our best friend, there's no doubt about it,'' said Lee
Cooke, executive director of the society. ``He's going to be very
sadly missed.''
   Vaughn and his late wife, Varina, bought their first orchid
about 50 years ago. He became a leading amateur grower _ one of the
first to develop the yellow phalaenopsis _ and his private
collection is among the world's largest.
   ``Somebody said, `Try an orchid,' and I bought one in a pot, and
the blame thing bloomed. That was a cattleya, C. bowringiana. And I
still have a cutting from it on the mango tree by the office,''
Vaughn said in a 1987 interview.
   On Tuesday, about 9,000 of Vaughn's orchids were blooming.
   ``It's a little bit of heaven here,'' Cooke said.
   Vaughn, who was childless, is survived by six nieces and
nephews. Funeral services were scheduled for Friday afternoon here.

<TEXT>
   Olive Carey, veteran actress of
Hollywood's Golden Age and wife and mother to a pair of famous
Harry Careys, has died. She was 92.
   Born Olive Golden on Jan. 31, 1896, she came from a performing
family headed by her father, famed vaudeville entertainer George
Fuller Golden.
   Mrs. Carey died of natural causes at her home Sunday.
   The actress destined to wed actor Harry Carey appeared on screen
with him in the 1914 silent movie, ``The Sorrowful Shore.'' She
later worked with director D.W. Griffith.
   While the Careys worked under contract for Universal Studios,
she introduced her husband to a 21-year-old prop man, John Ford.
She persuaded Carey to allow the unknown Ford to direct his first
two-reel western, ``The Soul Herder.''
   Ford went on to rank among the top directors in film history.
   They became lifelong friends along with another budding young
western actor, John Wayne.
   Mrs. Carey made several films with Ford, Wayne, her husband and
their son, Harry Carey Jr.
   When Carey died in 1947, Mrs. Carey came out of retirement to
act in such films as ``The Searchers,'' ``The Alamo'' and ``Two
Rode Together.''
   She has appeared with other Hollywood greats such as Jimmy
Stewart, Richard Widmark, Vera Miles and Natalie Wood.
   Mrs. Carey is survived by a sister, Mignonne, her son, Harry
Carey Jr., a daughter, Cappy Carey, six grandchildren and seven
great-grandchildren.
   She was to be memorialized today in a private ceremony at her
home about 75 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

   Ranchers whose rangeland was devastated by
a wildfire that killed about 200 head of cattle are receiving gifts
of about 350,000 pounds of hay daily to keep their operations
going, officials say.
   Many cities around the state are conducting hay drives for
ranchers affected by the fire, said Alan Heirman of the federal
Soil Conservation Service.
   ``We have received a tremendous response to the hay program,''
Heirman said Tuesday. ``Today, we received about 100 different
donations of hay, with promises of close to 15,000 square bales and
500 to 1,000 round bales.''
   The wildfire charred an estimated 350,000 acres of rangeland
before it was declared under control Monday afternoon. Weary
firefighters who had fought the blaze since last Thursday were sent
home Tuesday.
   A frost helped cool the ground and extinguish the blaze, said
Mahlon Hammetter, a spokesman for the Texas Forest Service. But
rain is needed to help rejuvenate the scorched ground, he said.
   ``We are saving a lot of cattle,'' said Heirman. ``If we can get
some rain, we may see them continue to live. Everybody's praying
for rain right now.''
   About 200 cattle died on 53 ranches in Shackelford County, he
said, and about 500 head were injured.
   On Monday, Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby issued a disaster proclamation
for the region, said Don Couch of the governor's Emergency
Management Division in Austin. Gov. Bill Clements was out of the
state, said the governor's press secretary, Reggie Bashur.
   The fire probably started when flames from burning trash went
out of control near Abilene last Thursday, authorities said.
   The fire burned in an area 56 miles long and 24 miles wide in
Shackelford, Jones, Haskell, Throckmorton and Callahan counties.

   Some Israelis are protesting that domestic and
foreign journalists covering riots in the occupied lands are
producing reports that are pro-Palestinian and damaging to Israel's
image.
   Israel Television has received dozens of threatening letters for
its reporting of the more than three months of violent protests in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip _ coverage most foreign journalists
consider mild.
   Even New York Mayor Edward Koch has joined in the criticism.
Koch wrote in the Jersualem Post today that television cameras
should be barred from the occupied territories.
   ``Many other nations throughout the world are experiencing
troubles similar to those now taking place in Israel. Should Israel
be the only nation to allow full television coverage of these
troubles?'' Koch wrote.
   An American television network says threats have forced it to
hire private guards to protect its offices and an Israeli cameraman.
   ``There's an escalation in statements against us,'' Eli Fassman,
head of the Union of Television Crews, told Israel radio this week.
``These criticisms border on incitement to murder.''
   There is also growing physical danger in covering the rioting,
the managing director of Israel's state-run television, Chaim
Yavin, said in an interview.
   He said Israel Television cameramen have been given a special
first aid and self-protection course. They were taught to defend
themselves against a mob, make speedy exits and use the camera as a
weapon, the daily Hadashot reported.
   In the occupied West Bank's Al Amari camp, cameramen were seen
Tuesday wearing large tin containers over their heads to protect
themselves from stones.
   Most of the mail that arrives at Israel Television is critical.
   ``We are accused of being leftists, PLO supporters. There are
threatening letters, too,'' said Yavin.
   An Israel Television spokeswoman, Sari Timmerman, said at least
five or six such letters arrive each day at her office while others
go directly to Yavin.
   The number of letters has not increased since the
anti-occupation rioting began Dec. 8, but most are now devoted to
patriotic criticism of Israel Television's performance in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Many ask why we permit hostile elements to use state-run media
for expressing their views,'' Ms. Timmerman said.
   There are also telephoned complaints.
   ``If the action gets tough, we get up to 100 calls a night, most
from people who say they don't want to see this or want us to be
more favorable to the government,'' said Yair Stern, the head of
the news department.
   The TV's Arab-language department faces another kind of threat.
   Israeli media reports said its workers have received Palestine
Liberation Organization-inspired calls to stop cooperating with
Israeli authorities and resign. Department head Yosef Barel denied
the reports.
   ``People in the territories want coverage, and they know no Arab
TV is covering them apart from us,'' he said.
   Foreign networks are sometimes accused of inflaming violence and
unwittingly aiding anti-Israeli rioters.
   ``The press _ and I'm speaking primarily about the foreign TV
networks _ has explicitly been a side involved in the events,''
President Chaim Herzog has said. He said foreign television crews
are ``the main weapon'' of the Arabs.
   He was the latest in a series of Israeli officials to criticize
foreign media. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and army spokesman Brig. Gen. Ephraim Lapid also have
spoken out.
   ``Certain Israeli officials, by their public statements, have
created a lynch atmosphere against reporters,'' said Bill Seamans,
ABC News bureau chief.
   The CBS News bureau chief, Terry Plantinga, said his network
hired guards to protect its Tel Aviv offices and cameraman Moshe
Alpert after receiving telephoned threats.
   Last month, Alpert filmed four Israeli soldiers brutally beating
two bound Palestinian youths with rocks in the West Bank city of
Nablus. The broadcast sparked international criticism and the army
put the soldiers on trial.

   A jubilant Sen. Paul Simon savored a primary
victory in his home state of Illinois, saying, ``I have been judged
by those who know me best'' and talking optimistically today of his
chances at a brokered Democratic National Convention.
   He promptly turned his sights on the next tests _ Michigan,
which holds caucuses on March 26, and Wisconsin, which holds its
primary April 5. Simon was campaigning in Wisconsin today.
   He said he hopes to make a respectable showing in Michigan's
March 26 caucuses, but said he does not expect to win.
   ``Frankly, I hope we pick up a good chunk of delegates and do
respectably, but I don't anticipate winning in Michigan,'' said
Simon. ``In Wisconsin, we're going to have to have some paid media
... and I expect to do well.''
   He had predicted repeatedly during his Illinois campaign that
none of the Democratic candidates would have the nomination wrapped
up by the time the party's national convention begins in July, and
he said today his victory was evidence to support that prediction.
   ``The reality is we're going to have to go, we're going to have
a wide open convention,'' he said on ABC-TV. ``I don't know who out
there will emerge, but I think Paul Simon has as good a shot as
anyone.''
   Party chairman Paul Kirk said this week that if there is no
obvious winner by the end of the primary season party leaders and
the candidates should meet and settle on a nominee before the
convention. But Simon said he didn't think much of that idea.
   ``I would be happy to participate,'' he said. But he added, ``I
am doubtful that you're going to emerge with a winner from that
kind of operation. ... I'm not saying no to a summit meeting; I'll
participate, but I'm not optimistic that it will provide answers.''
   In the Illinois contest, Simon beat out fellow favorite son
Jesse Jackson, with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis finishing
well behind the two leaders.
   Earlier, Simon had made it clear that Illinois was a
``must-win'' state for him, saying he would drop out if he did not
win both the popular and the delegate vote.
   He did both.
   ``This is a new beginning for the Paul Simon candidacy,'' he
told a packed Chicago hotel ballroom of cheering supporters Tuesday
night. He was interrupted frequently with shouts of ``We Want
Paul.''
   Even with his victory, Simon's national delegate total lagged
far behind those of Dukakis, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Jackson.
   The Associated Press delegate survey showed Dukakis with 464.5
and Jackson with 460.55 delegates. Gore had 354.8, and Simon 171.5
delegates. Only Rep. Richard Gephardt, who was fighting for
survival after a poor Super Tuesday showing, trailed Simon with 145.
   Simon says his victory in his home state showed there is no
clear-cut winner in the Democratic presidential race _ and that
means he still has a chance.
   ``It's not over yet,'' he declared.
   Dukakis, Jackson and Gore carved up the victories and the votes
among them last week on Super Tuesday. Simon sat out the contests.
   The senator seemed in good spirits as he cast his ballot at the
Makanda Township Fire Station along with his wife, Jeanne, telling
reporters: ``I had no trouble deciding who to vote for.''
   Simon, who was strapped for cash, spent no money on television
ads in the Illinois primary campaign, hoping instead to draw
support on the basis of his record. By contrast, rivals Gore and
Dukakis spent heavily _ $200,000 for Gore, $250,000 for Dukakis.
   Simon openly worried that he could take second place to Jackson
if Dukakis siphoned off enough votes.

   Zwilling said O'Connor was invited to celebrate the 200th

in New York City from 1823 to 1853.
   O'Connor was invited about two months ago by a group of Catholic
bishops in Cuba and is scheduled to give the homily at several
services during his visit.
   Argentine Cardinal Eduardo Pironio visited Cuba in 1986 as the
papal representative to a major assembly of Cuban Catholics.

   A robbery suspect holding a gun to a
restaurant manager's head was shot to death at point blank range by
police when he refused to release the man, according to officials.
   Police surrounded the Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet Tuesday
night when one of four people in the establishment was able to trip
a silent alarm, said officer Dennis Norris.
   The unidentified gunman died early today at Mission Emergency
Hospital. Restaurant manager Waylon Gee was grazed on the head from
the gunfire.
   ``Officers had a clear shot and fired numerous times,'' Norris
said. The gunman did not get off a shot, he said.
   ``The man stayed until closing time and then held up the
place,'' Norris said.

   Police arrived as the man was leaving and it was then that he
put the gun to Gee's head.

   A 34-year-old man has been charged with
murdering a friend by dousing him with gasoline and setting him
afire after an evening of drink and drugs.
   William Wesley Swain was charged Tuesday with murdering Henry L.
Brown, 37, also of Asbury Park, during the evening of March 9.
   Brown's body was found March 10 by firefighters who responded to
a call at 3 a.m. at his apartment, according to Monmouth County
Prosecutor John Kaye.
   The body was found in the kitchen, Kaye said. Firefighters
apparently removed the body, and it was not until the medical
examiner's office detected gasoline on the clothes that an
investigation began, leading to Swain's arrest Tuesday.
   Kaye said the two men had been drinking and taking drugs during
the day and evening before Brown argued with Swain and threw him
out of Brown's car.
   Swain returned to Brown's apartment, found a can of gasoline
Brown kept for a motorcycle, doused Brown and ignited him, Kaye
said.
   Swain was sent to the Monmouth County Correctional Institution
on $150,000 bail.

   The Afghanistan peace talks resumed today with no
new target date for their completion and growing impatience in
Moscow, which renewed charges that the United States and Pakistan
were blocking the pact's progress.
   Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil, speaking at a news
conference, also said that Pakistan was delaying progress on a
settlement but said Afghanistan sees no reason to suspend the
talks, now in their sixth year.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told
U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock that the Kremlin wants the United
States and Pakistan to stop ``artificially procrastinating'' on an
agreement, the Tass news agency said.
   The Soviets offered fresh assurances, however, that it would
still remove its estimated 115,000 troops two months after a
settlement is signed. Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in
1979 and are helping the Marxist government fight U.S.-backed
Moslem guerrillas.
   At issue were Pakistan's demand for a broad-based transitional
government to replace the current, Soviet-backed adminsitration in
Kabul, and for a simultaneous end to military assistance to the
warring sides.
   Pakistan argues that only a government replacing the present
administration of President Najib could guarantee that a peace
settlement would be put in place and ensure the safe return of more
than 5 million refugees.
   Pakistan, where most of the Afghan refugees live, has been
representing the guerrilla movement during the U.N.-sponsored talks.
   The importance of a simultaneous cut-off of superpower military
aid has been particularly stressed by Washington. It would mean
that Soviet aid to its allies in Kabul would have to end at the
same time as aid to the guerrillas who get the bulk of their
supplies from the United States.
   An official Soviet statement issued Tuesday in Moscow condemned
attempts ``to dictate to the U.S.S.R and Afghanistan how they
should build their bilateral relations.''
   The Soviet statement confirmed, however, that the decision to
pull out the troops still stands and that the withdrawal would
begin two months after the signing of a Geneva settlement.
   In Moscow, Tass said the discussion between Shevardnadze and
Matlock dealt mostly with the Afghanistan issue.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert confirmed that Matlock
had a meeting with Shevardnadze that included a discussion on
Afghanistan, but said it is embassy policy not to disclose details
of diplomatic exchanges.
   ``The ambassador's attention was drawn to the Soviet
government's statement of March 15, which contains a principled
assessment of the unsatisfactory situation at the Afghan-Pakistani
talks in Geneva, and also contains a clear-cut qualification of the
actions of Pakistan and the United States which are artifically
procrastinating the signing of actually agreed-upon accords,'' Tass
said.
   In Geneva, Wakil told reporters that Pakistan's stand amounted
to a ``unilateral suspension'' and would get the talks nowhere.
   Wakil spoke shortly before a new session with U.N.
Undersecretary General Diego Cordovez, the intermediary in the
talks. It was the first meeting since the talks failed to meet the
target of March 15 set by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for their
conclusion.
   He charged that Pakistan had organized the war which had already
led also to ``tragic events'' on Pakistan's side. He warned that
allowing the conflict to continue would pose a threat to the entire
region.

   Jesse Jackson's best week in the 1988 campaign brought seven
victories in seven days, but his streak ended with a disappointing
second-place finish in Illinois that highlighted the obstacles he
faces in the big-state primaries to come.
   Jackson drew less than 10 percent of the white vote in Tuesday's
primary.
   Nevertheless, Jackson said today that he has broader support
than any other candidate. ``When you get second place in Idaho and
in Florida, and Minnesota, Vermont, Maine, you're getting white
vote,'' he said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   ``When it's all said and done, it's just Democratic votes. I
have the most Democratic votes. I expect to have the most
Democratic delegates.''
   Jackson is locked in a tight race with Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis for the lead in the delegate count.
   ``I'm running No. 1 in popular votes and in delegate votes,''
Jackson said after the Illinois results were known Tuesday,
overstating the delegate situation a bit. ``Illinois has been good
to two favorite sons today. It has also given me the lead for the
party.''
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois easily won the primary.
   ``If I have the most Democratic votes and I have the most
delegates, I will be the nominee. That is my preoccupation,''
Jackson declared.
   Taking a third of the popular vote in Illinois, Jackson was
close to amassing 3 million votes in the first 20 primaries of 1988.
   Before the home-state primary, he had trailed Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis slightly in total primary votes, 2.61 million to
2.57 million. Dukakis was winning less than 20 percent of the vote
in Illinois, boosting his total to just over 2.8 million votes.
   In delegates before the Illinois returns, Dukakis held the lead
over Jackson, but his margin was almost wiped out by the Illinois
returns. Dukakis was being shut out in the direct election of
delegates in Illinois.
   Jackson has proven that he can win votes. And on Super Tuesday
he proved he can win state primaries, taking the top spot in
Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia. Later in the
week he won the caucuses in South Carolina and, surprisingly Alaska.
   The calendar now forces him to prove again that he can win
primary victories, this time in states not nearly as friendly to
his hopes as those in the past week.
   Jackson's showing in his home state of Illinois on Tuesday
illustrates his problem.
   He swept the black vote in Chicago and added less than 10
percent of the white vote to put together a second-place finish to
fellow favorite son Simon.
   Jackson decried any emphasis on the racial division of the vote,
saying ``there is a preoccupation with the ethnic breakdown'' of
the balloting.
   But to win in the states to come, Jackson must do better among
the white voters while holding the great bulk of a high-turnout
black vote.
   In the major states holding primaries in the next six weeks _
Michigan, Connecticut, Wisconsin, New York and Pennsylvania _ there
are substantial black populations to give Jackson a core of
support. But the relative size of the potential black voting bloc
is smaller in each of the coming states than it was in the South,
where Jackson won his primary victories.
   And, in the industrial states to come, those black voters are
heavily concentrated in a few congressional districts.
   Jackson will do quite well in the delegate contests there _ as
he did in three districts in Illinois _ but without substantial
white backing in other districts, his delegate count will not add
up as fast as his opponents'.
   The Jackson campaign didn't win any victories in the early going
of the presidential season, but he did have some surprisingly
powerful showings in states outside his traditional strongholds.
   He was fourth in Iowa and New Hampshire. But then he came in a
surprising second in the Minnesota caucuses on Feb. 23. He was
second as well in the Maine caucuses on Feb. 28 and in the Vermont
primary on March 1.
   The victory march for Jackson began in the region that was his
birthplace, the South. Jackson won five states across the region on
March 8, Super Tuesday. On Saturday, he returned to the state of
his birth _ South Carolina _ for a big victory in that state's
caucuses. He then took first place in the Alaska caucuses.
   Looking to the upcoming events, Jackson faces the Illinois
problem again.
   In Michigan, with its caucuses March 26, about 12 percent of the
population is black. But only four congressional districts out of
18 had more than 10 percent black population in the 1980 census.
   In Connecticut, only about 7 percent of the population is black,
although three of the six congressional districts have substantial
minority populations in the March 29 primary.
   In the Wisconsin primary on April 5, the black population is
centered in Milwaukee, adding up to only about 4 percent statewide.
   In the big New York contest on April 19, about 14 percent of the
population is black. And some 13 of the 34 congressional districts
have more than 10 percent minority residents.
   In Pennsylvania _ with an April 26 primary _ the black
population is about 9 percent, heavily concentrated in four of the
state's 23 congressional districts.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
today said the Kremlin will find democratic solutions to the recent
ethnic unrest in his country, but he stressed there could be no
secession from the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev, who has been critical of some of his predecessors,
indirectly attacked former Kremlin leader Josef Stalin when he
referred to Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito's break with Moscow in
1948.
   The Soviet leader also said the superpowers should reduce their
naval forces in the Mediterranean, and he accused NATO of slowing
the pace of nuclear disarmament.
   In his address to the Yugoslav Parliament, Gorbachev said ethnic
relations are ``one of the most important and delicate issues'' in
the Soviet Union and that it would be unnatural to think they were
`once and for all resolved.'''
   Yugoslavia itself is an ethnically diverse nation of six
republics and two autonomous regions _ Kosovo and Vojvodina _ and
is plagued by rising ethnic tensions as the economic situation
worsens.
   There are both ``certain difficulties inherited from the past''
and other ``problems created by the passage of time and the changes
in the economic life of society,'' Gorbachev said.
   He made no mention of riots that killed at least 32 people in
the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait in February, nor of recent mass
protests by Armenians demanding the return of a largely Armenian
region put under the administration of Azerbaijan in 1923.
   But he said that on ethnic problems, ``We are determined to
reach democratic solutions which would correspond to the interest
of each and every nation ... and our entire Socialist society.''
   Gorbachev indicated, however, there could be no question of
secession, saying that each region within Soviet borders has
``indissoluble links'' with the rest of the country. The Soviet
Union is comprised of 15 republics.
   In the Baltic states of the north, some activists want
independence from Moscow.
   Gorbachev's itinerary does not include Kosovo, Yugoslavia's most
ethnically troubled area, but he will travel to Slovenia, the most
developed republic.
   In a wide-ranging 40-minute speech, Gorbachev said the 1948
rupture in Soviet-Yugoslav relations ``inflicted grave damage on
Yugoslav-Soviet relations and ... on socialism as a whole.''
   Ties between Moscow and Yugoslavia were mended after Stalin's
death in 1953, when Nikita S. Khrushchev and Tito agreed on
bilateral relations in 1955 and 1956.
   Now, Gorbachev said, ``both sides are eager to raise our
interstate and interparty relations to a new level, to give them a
new quality'' and expand ties.
   A new declaration on Yugoslav-Soviet relations adopted Tuesday
is to be published Friday, when Gorbachev returns home.
   Gorbachev also outlined new proposals for Mediterranean
security. He enlarged on previous suggestions for reducing the
superpowers' naval presence in the waterway by proposing the United
States and the Soviet Union freeze the number of warships they have
there on July 1.
   Washington and Moscow should then agree on the number of
warships they maintain in the Mediterranean, with the eventual aim
being a withdrawal of Soviet ships if the United States follows
suit, Gorbachev said.
   In addition, he said, the superpowers should give each other
advance notice of all ship movements and naval maneuvers in the
Mediterranean.
   Gorbachev stressed that for the Soviets, the Mediterranean ``is
no remote area'' because it is the passage to and from the Black
Sea ports of the southern Soviet Union.
   ``Naturally, we are interested in routes of peace and not those
of war passing here,'' he said.
   Gorbachev also attacked what he said were efforts by
unidentified politicians in the NATO alliance to block total
nuclear disarmament and to respond to the removal of medium-range
nuclear missiles from Europe by building up conventional weapons.
   ``These contradictions, not to say absurdities, have quite
definite political convictions behind them,'' Gorbachev said.
   Such politicians want to paint Moscow in a bad light at any
price, he said.
   ``They keep harping on the lie of the Soviet Union's and Warsaw
Pact's war image'' when Moscow is working on ``weeding out for good
the Cold War sprouts'' in East-West relations, Gorbachev said.

<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old girl, frustrated in efforts
to get information for a class report on Mississippi, flew there
for a five-day visit there as a guest of the Southern state.
   Melissa Montgomery, a fifth grade student at John Swett
Elementary School in Martinez, was greeted by classmates when she
returned Tuesday night to Oakland International Airport.
   She said the strangest part of the trip was when people laughed
at her accent.
   ``I said `you guys,' they said `you all,''' she said.
   Her mother, Kathryn Montgomery, said all expenses except plane
fare were paid by an anonymous person.
   The mother said she called the Mississippi secretary of state's
office and was told the office was out of reference works. She was
half-seriously told to send the girl to Mississippi.
   ``I said, `great, I will,''' she said. The next morning she got
a call from a Mississippi mother who was wiling to take care of
Melissa.
   The girl even met Ray Mabus, the Mississippi governor.
   ``He was nice,'' she said.
   Melissa said she toured museums, battlefields, mansions and rode
a pony.
   ``There are a lot of museums,'' she said, adding that the
favorite part of the trip was a visit to the Impressionist Gallery.
   ``It had neat stuff in it,'' she said.
   The 5-to-10 page class report is due March 23.

   A 128-year-old exclusive private club has
admitted its first two black male members but continues to ban
women.
   The two men broke the color barrier at the Olympic Club, where
membership costs $12,500 plus monthly dues and greens fees.
   ``I've played golf for years with Olympic members,'' said Roy
Clay, president of a company that makes electronics testing
equipment. He said he applied and was interviewed last fall and was
accepted last week.
   ``I'm not a golfer,'' said Jessie Knight, vice president of
marketing for the San Francisco Newspaper Agency. ``I joined
strictly because of the athletic facilities. The club is close by,
and it's good place to work out.''
   A city ordinance that went into effect in December bars private
clubs with more than 400 members from discriminating against
minorities and women.
   However, club spokesman Jim Myers said the ban on women members
will remain pending the outcome of a court battle with the city and
an appeal to the federal courts on constitutional grounds of
freedom of association.

<HEAD>Vietnam Says Its Freighters On Fire After Chinese Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Vietnamese freighters were
burning today after Chinese warships attacked them, and Chinese
were blocking efforts to rescue the crew, an official Vietnamese
broadcast said.
   China said today that some Chinese were wounded in the exchange
of gunfire in the South China Sea.
   The Voice of Vietnam radio said the freighters have been on fire
since they were attacked Monday near disputed islands claimed by
Vietnam, China, the Philippines and Taiwan.
   Vietnam calls the islands the Truong Sa archipelago. They are
known in China as the Nansha Islands. They also are called the
Spratly Islands.
   The broadcast said Nguyen Phuong Vu, head of the China
department of Vietnam's Foreign Ministry, made the accusations in a
meeting today with Li Shuchin, Beijing's ambassador to Hanoi.
   ``The Vietnamese side sent lifeboats flying Red Cross flags to
rescue those freighters, but they were obstructed by Chinese
warships,'' said the broadcast, monitored in Bangkok.
   It added: ``The Vietnamese side urged the Chinese side to order
its warships to move away from this area and not to prevent the
Vietnamese ships from coming to the rescue of the crews on these
freighters. The Vietnamese side wishes a favorable and early reply
from the Chinese side.''
   The broadcast repeated earlier claims that the clash began when
the Chinese warships without provocation opened fire on two
Vietnamese freighters. It said that warships Nos. 502, 506 and 531
then fired on other Vietnamese freighters that had come to the
rescue.
   Vietnam's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday delivered an official
protest to China's ambassador to Hanoi, Li Shuchin, the official
Radio Hanoi reported earlier.
   The note called the alleged Chinese attack a military
provocation and attempt to grab Vietnamese territory. It said
Vietnam will ``resolutely apply all necessary measures to protect
(its) independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.''
   In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry disclosed today that China had
suffered casualties in the skirmish.
   Ministry spokeswoman Li Jihua gave China's version of the clash,
saying Vietnamese naval ships fired on Chinese vessels conducting a
scientific survey on a reef in the chain of 500 uninhabited islands
and reefs.
   ``The Chinese side was forced to make a limited counter-attack
in self defense,'' Ms. Li said.
   Ms. Li refused to disclose how many Chinese were wounded,
whether they were civilians or military personnel, or other details
of the clash.
   Large oil deposits are believed to be in the vicinity of the
archipelago, which is more than 310 miles south of Hainan Island.
   Vietnam has stationed troops on a few of the islands since the
early 1970s, while China has troops on a few islands of a second
disputed group, the nearby Xisha or Paracels.
   The clash Monday was the first reported exchange of gunfire
between Vietnam and China over the islands, although the two
governments periodically have verbal skirmishes.
   China was an ally of Vietnam's Communist Party during the
Vietnam War but relations cooled after the Communist Vietnamese
victory as Vietnam drifted closer into the Soviet orbit.
   China and Vietnam fought a brief border war in 1979.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: A Bizarre Explanation for the Bush Phenomenon</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 7th graf, Dole hasn't, to CORRECT that Dole has won 3
states since Iowa</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It seems there are people out there who actually want George
Bush to become president of the United States. That novel notion
may explain why the primary election count is now Bush 20, Sen. Bob
Dole 1.
   That simplest of explanations is about the only one that has not
been advanced by the political sages during the remarkable
month-long string of victories that leaves Bush the all-but-certain
GOP nominee.
   More popular explanations for Bush's lopsided success run this
way:
   As vice president, he has the benefits of President Reagan's
popularity. His organization is strong, Dole's is weak. He has the
biggest campaign bankroll by far. He has had the support of
governors in key states: New Hampshire, South Carolina, Illinois.
   Each of those factors certainly helped. In addition, the
trappings and status of the vice presidency have so far served Bush
well, overcoming the disadvantage No. 2 men always have had in
running for the top job _ they can't argue with the boss and they
must defend what's already in place.
   But all those elements combined could not produce the kind of
landslides Bush has been gaining unless the vice president had a
constituency to call his own, and was strengthening it.
   Just a month ago today, Bush won his first significant victory
in New Hampshire. On Tuesday, he trounced Dole, the most credible
rival still standing, in the Illinois primary.
   Since opening day in Iowa, Dole has won just one primary _ in
South Dakota _ and caucuses in Minnesota and his home state of
Kansas.
   The total popular vote in the 21 GOP primaries held so far this
year is Bush 3.3 million, Dole 1.6 million.
   Bush already has 772 of the 1,139 delegates needed to win the
GOP nomination in New Orleans next Aug. 17. Dole has 180.
   All of that has wiped away the memory of embarrassment in Iowa,
where Bush ran third to Dole and the rapidly vanishing Pat
Robertson, and of the week he then spent on the political critical
list.
   Since then he has been winning big, with only minor setbacks.
   Dole complains that the primaries are ending up as a referendum
on Reagan, not a contest with Bush. ``If I hit him directly, I get
Ronald Reagan first and then they say, oh, oh, he's out there
attacking Ronald Reagan,'' the Kansas senator said. ``It's pretty
hard to reach Bush except by phone.''
   He found plenty to hit Bush with earlier in the contest, and he
still taunts the vice president as a man who got where he is
``without ever doing much.''
   He also calls him a loser. ``Sooner or later, the voters in one
of these states are going to say `Hold it, we're about to nominate
a candidate who can't win,''' Dole said after losing 16 primaries
to Bush on Super Tuesday.
   But recent polls conducted for USA Today, Time and Newsweek show
Bush leading potential Democratic nominees. Besides, at this point
no one can say who's a likely winner in the fall. The tickets
aren't known, the issues aren't set, and the odds are subject to
wide swings. In fact, the pollsters said Bush trailed several of
the potential Democratic nominees just before his Super Tuesday
sweep.
   The Dole camp has not managed to zero in on a state likely to
reverse the trend; in contests over the next month the polls point
to Bush.
   Accepting defeat in Illinois, which he had said would be his
comeback state, Dole said he would keep campaigning.
   ``We're just going to hang in there,'' Dole said. In Washington,
the pundits thought Dole was waiting to see if any of the upcoming
Iran-Contra indictments might reflect badly on the vice president.
   But against a runaway delegate leader, Dole doesn't have much
else to hang in for, nor does he have a limitless bankroll with
which to do it.
   Dole argues that it is too early for the competition to end, and
says that he has been encouraged by other Republicans, including
former President Richard M. Nixon, to stick with the race.
   That was not one of his themes after Iowa, when there were
suggestions that a New Hampshire defeat would doom Bush and trigger
a Dole runaway. Nor did Nixon value competition for its own sake 20
years ago, when he drove George Romney out of the running even
before New Hampshire, and sailed through the primaries without real
opposition.
   For all that, the script isn't completed, and the convention is
five months away. There could still be damaging disclosures about
Iran-Contra, or about CIA links with Panamanian boss Manuel Noriega
when Bush headed the agency, a question Dole has been posing lately.
   Bush has shown himself capable of saying the wrong thing and
hurting his own cause. To guard against that, he's avoided saying
much of anything lately.

   The USS John Hancock's
disbursement office was robbed of $120,000 in cash and the battered
body of the ship's paymaster was found stuffed in a locker aboard
the destroyer, Navy officials said.
   The body of paymaster Lt. Ratish Prasad, 24, of Park Forest,

   ``He'd been bludgeoned,'' said the spokesman. ``He was beaten up
pretty bad.''
   The destroyer's disbursement office safe was found open and
$120,000 in cash plus an undetermined number of blank checks were
missing, Riccio said.
   ``An audit of the ship's funds is pending and alternate
arrangements have been made to pay the crew,'' said Riccio.
   Tuesday was payday for Navy personnel, who are paid the 1st and
15th of each month, said Riccio, adding that Navy and Jacksonville
sheriff's investigators were working on the case.
   Access to the Hancock, which was tied up at its home port here,
is strictly controlled, said Riccio. People trying to board the
ship must pass checkpoints at the base entrance, the pier area and
the ship itself, he said.
   Only family members and friends of the crew who have been
previously cleared are allowed aboard the ship in port, he said.
Even Naval personnel who do not have business on the ships cannot
board them, he said.

   Five explosions erupted today
as the coffins of three Irish Republican Army guerrillas killed by
British troops were being lowered into graves.
   Thousands of mourners clustered in the Roman Catholic Milltown
cemetery in West Belfast flung themselves on the ground as
organizers appealed for calm. There were no immediate reports of
injuries and it was not clear what caused the explosions.
   Several mourners grabbed a man evidently suspected of setting
the explosions. Hundreds of others rushed from the graveside toward
where the explosions took place.
   The explosions erupted after more than 4,000 mourners had
followed the flag-draped coffins of Mairead Farrell, 31, Sean
Savage, 24, and Daniel McCann, 30, to the cemetery.
   Several mourners shouted out they believed the explosions were
set by Protestant paramilitary groups.
   Police and troops, in an evidently deliberate policy, had kept
out of sight during the funerals, which began with a Requiem Mass
in a packed parish church, St. Agnes.
   The mourners had followed the coffins, draped in the Irish
tricolor, through somber streets, with shops shut, to the cemetery.
   At the mass in St. Agnes, mourners listened silently as the
priest charged that the unarmed trio, ambushed on a bombing
mission, were murdered.
   Shortly before the funeral began, a bomb exploded on a street
more than a mile from the church, slightly injuring a British
soldier on foot patrol, police reported.
   Earlier, about 150 mourners watched, with no sign or police or
troops, as relatives and members of Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal
political wing, carried the coffin of McCann from his parents'
two-story row house to be driven to the church.
   The almost exclusively Catholic Irish Republican Army is
fighting to push the British out of Protestant-dominated Northern
Ireland, join it with the Republic of Ireland and set up an
all-Ireland socialist state.
   In his funeral oration at St. Agnes, the Rev. Tom Toner called
the March 6 shootings in Gibraltar ``murder'' and accused British
authorities of ``gloating'' over them.
   More than 1,000 mourners listened in silence broken only by a
the crying of a baby.
   ``We have a mounting, accumulated anger at the treatment of
Irish people by Britain over the past weeks and months,'' he said.
   Britain says the guerrillas were shot by commandos while
preparing a car bomb attack on the changing of the guard outside
the governor's residence in the colony on the southern tip of Spain.
   The three were unarmed, but Britain said they made movements
that led the soldiers to believe their lives were in danger. The
Irish government has complained that the soldiers should have tried
to arrest the trio, who the IRA said were on ``active service.''
   Outside the chapel, a crowd of about 3,000 gathered to accompany
the coffins to Milltown, the burial ground for many other
guerrillas killed in nearly 20 years of sectarian strife which has
claimed more than 2,600 lives.
   In the tense buildup to the funerals, Protestants stoned hearses
that brought the IRA bodies home Tuesday on a 100-mile route from
Dublin. The coffins had been flown from Gibraltar on a plane
chartered by Sinn Fein.
   Hooded IRA gunmen fired a three-shot volley, the IRA's
traditional salute to guerrillas killed in its bomb and bullet
campaign against British rule, to coincide with the arrival of the
coffins on Irish soil.
   Two Catholics, including IRA member Kevin McCracken, 33, shot by
British troops near Savage's home on Monday, were fatally wounded
in Belfast over the past two days.
   Another Catholic, Charles McGrillan, died when unidentified
gunmen opened fire as he arrived for work Tuesday. Police said they
suspected a sectarian attack by Protestant militants.

<HEAD>Bakker Sues Former PTL Lawyer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YORK, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fallen television evangelist Jim Bakker has
sued a New York attorney who formerly represented the PTL ministry,
charging that the attorney tricked him into resigning and turning
the ministry over to the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
   In the suit, which seeks more than $10,000 in damages and was
filed this week in York County, Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye,
say they did not know that Roy Grutman also represented Falwell
when he advised the Bakkers to step down.
   ``What the Bakkers are really saying in the lawsuit is that Mr.
Grutman tricked the Bakkers into resigning from office to open the
way for Mr. Falwell to take over the leadership of the ministry,''
said Jim Toms, one of the Bakkers' attorneys.
   Grutman said Tuesday the allegations were ``utterly meritless,''
adding that he was never Bakker's attorney.
   ``I didn't tell him to resign. He made that decision,'' Grutman
said.
   Bakker left the Fort Mill-based ministry last March amid a sex
scandal involving a church secretary, Jessica Hahn. Falwell took
over the ministry for several months. PTL now is undergoing
reorganization in bankruptcy court.
   Grutman told the Bakkers, according to the suit, that television
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, now beset by a sex scandal himself, was
heading a conspiracy to take over PTL.
   The Bakkers claim that Grutman and Falwell advised them to
``turn the leadership of the ministry over to Mr. Falwell, who, it
was said, would lead the ministry as a caretaker until such time as
the (Bakkers) could return to the ministry,'' the suit said.
   The suit also charged that ``Grutman either knew or should have
known that the alleged conspiracy to seize control of PTL by Mr.
Swaggart, either was not truthfully reported or was impractical of
attainment.''
   Bakker resigned as PTL president on March 19; a month later,
Falwell took the Bakkers off the PTL payroll.
   The suit said the Bakkers left PTL ``severely damaged
financially and diminished as a Christian ministry'' and accused
Grutman of giving the Bakkers incorrect advice to resign, resulting
in damage to the Bakkers' reputations.

<HEAD>Sister Says Government No Longer Cares About Captives' Fate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sister of the longest-held American
hostage in Lebanon said today that the Reagan administration, once
obsessed with securing freedom for the captives, no longer cares
about their fate.
   ``I think it's rather interesting to look back and see the
concern expressed by the administration, by President Reagan, Vice
President Bush, and their rationale for the Iran-Contra scandal
that they were so obsessed with the fate of the hostages that they
made this move,'' Peggy Say, sister of hostage Terry Anderson, said
of the arms-for-hostages deal.
   ``And for the past year, silence. That obsession seems to have
been overcome and the fate of the hostages no longer seems to be of
great concern to anybody in this administration,'' she said on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held of 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon. He
was kidnapped on March 16, 1985, in Beirut as he was returning from
a tennis game.
   Services to mark the third anniversary of his abduction were
scheduled in Anderson's hometown of Batavia, N.Y., as well as
Buffalo and Rochester, and in California and Florida, Mrs. Say said.
   In Washington, Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson
was taking part at an afternoon service at Holy Trinity Roman
Catholic Church where prayers for Anderson and the other hostages
were to be offered by Christian and Islamic clergy.
   Participants, including three former hostages _ the Rev.
Lawrence Jenco, the Rev. Benjamin Weir and ABC News correspondent
Charles Glass _ were to read passages from the Bible and the Koran.
   Marilyn Langston, daughter of American hostage Frank Herbert
Reed, said today she hopes the service ``puts an awareness in
everyone's mind that this hostage situation is going on continually
and until they're all out we can't forget it.''
   Ms. Langston said, however, that she feared the captives have
been forgotten by the U.S. government.
   ``I feel they've been put on the backburner, that the concern
for the hostages _ I don't know if there is any any more,'' Ms.
Langston said on the NBC program.
   Reed, director of the Lebanon International School in Beirut,
was kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986. He is among the nine Americans held
captive in Lebanon, including Thomas Sutherland, Joseph James
Cicippio, Edward Austin Tracy, Jesse Turner, Robert Polhill, Alaan
Steen, and Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.

<HEAD>FAA Looks Into Testing Procedures at Continental</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is
investigating Continental Airlines' pilot testing procedures
following comments made last week at a hearing into a November
crash that killed 28 people, officials said.
   Daniel Beaudette, manager of the FAA's air transportation
division in Washington, said Tuesday that the investigation was set
off by one pilot's report that he made deliberate mistakes in wing
settings to test pilots.
   ``I can't see how they could safely do that in
passenger-carrying operations,'' Beaudette said. Federal
regulations prohibit pilot training on flights that carry
passengers.
   The inquiry follows testimony by Continental Capt. Kenneth
Watson last week before a National Transportation Safety Board
hearing into the Nov. 15 crash of a Continental DC-9 that killed 28
and injured 54 as it was taking off from Denver's airport.
   On a flight last October, Watson said he made incorrect
adjustments to an aircraft before takeoff in order to test pilot
Frank Zvonek, who died in the November crash.
   ``As is my common practice, I advised Frank that I would
intentionally make several mistakes,'' Watson told the hearing.
   ``I intentionally misset flaps, (stabilizer) trim and weight
cards for takeoff. He caught and corrected me on them,'' he said.
   If a violation is found, Continental could be issued an
administrative warning, fined, or Watson's license could be
suspended, Beaudette said.
   Continental spokesman Bruce Hicks said the procedure Watson
reported using is not a company policy.
   But Hicks said he didn't know whether the technique has been
used by other Continental pilots and said the airline has not yet
decided whether to permit that kind of pilot testing in the future.

   Iran said it fired five missiles into
Baghdad today, and Iraq said it shot seven into Tehran. The
Iranians said 52 civilians were killed in Tehran and in Iraqi
warplane raids on other cities.
   Iran also said its warplanes bombed other Iraqi cities today,
and its troops pushed into northeastern Iraq overnight and seized
the border town of Khurmal, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency
said. IRNA said 1,150 Iraqi troops were killed or wounded, but Iraq
had no comment on the reported offensive.
   Also today, foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council
met in Saudi Arabia to discuss the 7-year-old Iran-Iraq war and its
implications for the oil-rich region.
   On Tuesday, Iran accused the U.N. Security Council of wasting
time on an arms embargo instead of ending the missile duel, in
which scores of civilians have been killed or wounded.
   In Switzerland, the prestigious newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung
today quoted senior Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammed Hussein
Malaek as saying his country had cut all ties to the Security
Council.
   Malaek also was quoted as saying only a military solution could
end the Persian Gulf war, and that Iran no longer felt obligated to
respect international conventions, presumably including the Geneva
Convention on the conduct of nations at war.
   Iraq on Tuesday reiterated the claim that Iran broke a two-day
truce in the ``war of the cities'' and said it would continue to
attack Tehran until Iran stopped shelling border cities.
   The Iraqi News Agency said warplanes Tuesday night bombed
Iranian towns and attacked a ship in the Persian Gulf. Maritime
sources had earlier reported an Iraqi attack at around the same
time on the 249,223-ton Trade Fortitude.
   The Iranian agency said Revolutionary Guards fired five missiles
into Baghdad in retaliation for an air raid Tuesday that killed 25
students and teachers at a high school in al-Eshtar in western Iran.
   The Iraqi agency confirmed three of the hits on Baghdad and said
``many'' civilians were killed. Iraq said it fired seven missiles
into Tehran.
   Iran said an unspecified number of missiles hit the capital of
Tehran today and said Iraqi warplanes also bombed Bakhtaran and
other cities in western Iran. The Iranian agency said a total of 52
civilians were killed.
   Iraq says it has fired 22 missiles into Tehran since the tenuous
truce broke down late Sunday. Iran has reported launching seven
into Baghdad.
   Neither side has given an overall casualty count.
   Iran's news agency said Iranian jet fighters bombed the northern
Iraqi oil city of Kirkuk and other cities today, ``inflicting heavy
casualties and losses on the enemy.'' It said the jet fighters also
shot 16 air-to-ground missiles into Kirkuk.
   It said nine short-range missiles were fired into the southern
Basra province, the area surrounding Iraq's second-largest city.
   It said Revolutionary Guards pushed farther into Sulaymaniyah
province in northeastern Iraq, inflicting ``heavy losses.'' Earlier
in the week Iran said its fighters seized villages and hills in the
region, 160 miles north of Baghdad.
   Iranian forces took the town of Khurmal a few miles from the
border after a ``pitched battle,'' the agency reported today.
   It said residents of ``liberated villages'' in the area ``warmly
welcomed the attacking Iranian combatants,'' and Iranian forces
seized 95 square miles of Iraqi soil, including 21 villages.
   Announcing today's Iraqi missile strike on Iran, an Iraqi
military spokesman was quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency as
saying:
   ``We will continue our destructive hits into the nest of vice
and ugliness.''
   It also said Revolutionary Guards pushed farther into
Sulaymaniyah province in northeastern Iraq, inflicting ``heavy
losses'' and that Khurmal had fallen.
   Earlier in the week, Iran said its fighters seized villages and
hills in the region 160 miles north of Baghdad.
   The Iraqi and Iranian reports were monitored in Cyprus.
   The attack Tuesday on the Trade Fortitude raised the possibility
of revived attacks on shipping in the gulf, where the U.S.-flagged
Kuwaiti tanker Gas Prince was heading north in the 17th
U.S.-escorted convoy this year.
   Since Feb. 15, there have been two confirmed Iraqi attacks on
tankers in Iranian shipping lanes.

   Police investigating the death of a man
who was crushed between a truck and his porch ended up arresting
two people after they found out the truck was loaded with stolen
chickens, authorities said.
   Officers said Joshua Horton, 50, was pronounced dead at
Mississippi Baptist Medical Center after he was crushed between the
truck and a porch at his home about 11:35 p.m.
   Investigators said Patricia Tucker, 33, of Jackson, the victim's
step-daughter, was attempting to back the truck into Horton's
driveway to unload the frozen chickens when the brakes failed.
   The truck contained 20 boxes of chickens allegedly taken from a
Jackson firm where Tucker's husband, Edgar Tucker, 36, was
employed, officers said.
   A police spokesman said Tucker, who was at work when the
accident occurred, was arrested on an embezzlement charge while his
wife was charged with accessory to embezzlment.

<HEAD>Syria Now Exporting Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syria will become an oil exporter for the
first time because of new discoveries, officials said today.
   James Audu, a spokesman for the Vienna-based Organization of
Petroleum Exporting countries, said that Syria produced 240,000
barrels per day during the fourth quarter of last year.
   With local demand estimated at about 220,000 barrels a day, the
country would become a net exporter on an annual basis for the
first time this year, helping it to cope with a foreign debt of at
least $3 billion.
   The small amount of oil to be sold abroad will not qualify Syria
for membership in the oil cartel, Audu told The Associated Press in
Vienna. But it is expected to make that Arab nation a net exporter
in 1988, he said.
   Syria, with 10 million people, is not expected to become a big
exporter. But the modest 1.8 billion barrels of estimated oil
reserves should help alleviate the economic burden.
   President Hafez Assad announced in a speech to the nation last
week that there have been new oil discoveries but he did not
elaborate.
   The Damascus government currently gets millions of tons of
cut-price oil from Iran each year.
   Syria is Persian Iran's main ally in the 7-year-old Persian Gulf
war against Arab Iraq. But Damascus has come under growing pressure
from other Arab countries to stop supporting Iran against a fellow
Arab nation.

<TEXT>
   Like an electronic sneeze, a rogue computer
program known as a ``virus'' has spread to a major software
company's commercial programs, a frightening ``infection'' that the
experts once thought was impossible.
   On March 2, a ``message of peace'' created by the publisher of a
Canadian computer magazine appeared on as many as 350,000 Macintosh
computer screens in North America and Europe, apparently spread
like an epidemic through the network of electronic bulletin boards'
free or low-cost software.
   The message became the first known contamination of an
off-the-shelf program when it cropped up in FreeHand, Aldus Corp.'s
latest software, forcing the company to recall or rework about
5,000 copies of the program.
   It ``was a very benign incident,'' but Aldus officials ``are
talking with our attorneys to understand what our legal rights are
in this instance,'' said Laury Bryant, a spokeswoman for the
Seattle-based software company.
   Viruses are small, secret programs created by programmers as
jokes or acts of vandalism, then secretly inserted into other
programs. Viruses can spread from computer to computer by operators
sharing ``contaminated'' software.
   At their most benign, viruses will cause only a message to pop
up on a computer screen, as apparently happened here. At their
worst, as ``tapeworms'' or ``logic bombs,'' they can destroy
information stored in computer memories.
   Richard Brandow of the Montreal-based computer magazine MacMag
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Tuesday that he
wrote the virus, but intended only to show the dangers of software
piracy, or unauthorized copying.
   The full message, said Brandow, read: ``Richard Brandow, the
publisher of MacMag, and its entire staff would like to take this
opportunity to convey their universal message of peace to all
Macintosh users around the world.'' Beneath that was a graphic of
the globe.
   Ms. Bryant said fewer than 5,000 copies of FreeHand were
contaminated by a an infected disk that was copied for three days
by a disk duplicating machine, and only half the infected disks
were distributed to retailers.
   Until now, personal computer viruses were thought to reside only
in noncommercial ``freeware'' or ``shareware'' legally distributed
on computerized bulletin boards or on software disks shared by
computer users.
   Experts had thought viruses could be avoided if users didn't
freely distribute software, but only used off-the-shelf programs.
   The incident rocked the computer industry because the nation's
three largest software companies _ Microsoft Corp., Ashton-Tate,
and Lotus Development Corp. _ are clients of MacroMind Inc. of
Chicago, the company that inadvertently gave the virus to Aldus.
   Ashton-Tate declined comment, but officials at Microsoft, Apple
and Lotus said none of their software was infected.
   MacroMind President Marc Canter said in a telephone interview
Tuesday that to the best of his knowledge, none of his other
customers received the virus and that the program has erased itself.
   Ms. Bryant and Brandow said the virus died out after March 2,
the anniversary of the introduction of Apple's Macintosh SE and
Macintosh II models.
   Canter said the peace message apparently was in software he
obtained from Brandow during a visit to Montreal. The packet
included a game program called Mr. Potato Head, a computerized
version of the popular toy.
   Unaware of the ``infection,'' Canter ran the game program once
and then used the same computer to work on a disk to teach
Macintosh users how to use FreeHand.
   That original disk became infected, and then contaminated other
FreeHand teaching disks when it was copied by Aldus, he said.
   Canter, upset with Brandow, also said he was considering legal
action. Brandow said he met Canter, but denied giving him the
software.
   Brandow said the idea for the message program was written and
tested for a year, then left for two days in December on a
Macintosh at MacMag's offices, a frequent gathering place for
Macintosh devotees.
   The publisher said he expected pirated programs from the machine
would spread the peace message in the Montreal area and a few other
areas of Canada and the United States.
   Instead, he said, he was shocked to find that, by his estimate,
350,000 people in North America and Europe had the message pop up
on their Macintoshes on March 2.

   Whoever said one vote doesn't count
isn't following Sand Lake politics, such as they are.
   In a somewhat less than spirited election for a vacant village
trustee's seat, Bob VandenBerg, Ralph Boerman and Earl Thomas
finished in a three-way tie _ each receiving precisely one write-in
vote.
   A winner will be chosen at 9 a.m. March 21 under Kent County's
official tie-breaking method, a drawing at the County Clerk's
office in Grand Rapids. Two slips of paper marked ``Not Elected''
and one marked ``Elected'' will be put in a box and drawn by the
candidates or their representatives.
   The Village Council in this community of about 400 people will
appoint a trustee if the winner declines the job, something that
appeared to be more than a remote possibility.
   Thomas, 40, served 14 years as village clerk but didn't run this
year, saying his night job prevented him from attending council
meetings. ``I was a clerk for 14 years, so I did my time,'' he said.
   VandenBerg, 51, chose not to run for re-election as village
president this year after six years in local politics. ``I figured
it was time for the young ones to take over,'' he said.
   Boerman, at 22 a political neophyte, could be considered one of
VandenBerg's ``young ones.'' But Boerman said he didn't know he was
in the running until a reporter telephoned him with news of the
three-way tie.
   ``I haven't ever thought about it,'' Boerman said. ``No one has
approached me or asked me or anything.''
   Thomas said he'd like to know who wrote in his name.
   ``I'll kill `em, whoever it was,'' he joked.

<TEXT>
   A couple collecting aluminum cans found
the remains of the sixth body discovered in the desert since last
fall, and police said they needed an autopsy to determine the
victim's age, sex and cause of death.
   However, Police Chief John Scagno said Tuesday the discovery of
the exposed, bleached bones on the outskirts of El Paso wasn't
cause for panic.
   The sixth body was found Monday afternoon northeast of El Paso,
a few hundred yards from where the bodies of five young women were
unearthed.
   No one has been charged in the desert deaths, which police have
said could be the work of a serial killer. However, police have
identified a suspect who has been jailed on unrelated sexual
assault charges since Oct. 14.
   Police took two days to unearth the latest skeletal remains,
sifting buckets of excavated dirt.
   Scagno would not comment on whether clothing or a weapon was
found at the scene.
   ``The only detail we're going to tell you is ... the body had
(dental) braces,'' Scagno said. ``The body itself is just skeletal
remains.''
   Skeletons were all that remained of the first five victims.
   Scagno said he didn't know when the autopsy results would be
released.
   The search for the desert killer began in September, when a
utility company employee found the first body while digging a hole
near several highways.
   Although police concluded their search of the area in January,
Scagno said they now plan to start looking again.
   The remains of Maria Rosa Casio, 24, and Karen Baker, 20, were
found buried close together Sept. 4. The bodies of Desiree
Wheatley, 15, and Dawn Smith, 14, were found Oct. 20, about 200
yards from the first two bodies. The body of Angelica Frausto, 17,
was found Nov. 3, between the first two pairs of graves.
   Ms. Casio, from a Dallas suburb, had been here visiting a
relative when she disappeared. The other victims were from El Paso.
   The sixth victim's grave was found a few hundred yards away from
the other five graves, Deputy Chief Gus Massey said.

<HEAD>Tearful Rape Defendant Opts For Plea To Spare Victim, Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After tearfully telling his lawyer
``there was still some good in him,'' a rape defendant pleaded
guilty so he could spare his 16-year-old victim the trauma of
testifying.
   Terry Lee Buckholtz was charged with raping the teen in November
1986 when he was in a prison work-release program, and then trying
to kill her and her brother with a meat cleaver.
   The brother and sister survived their wounds, and were to take
the witness stand Tuesday in court here.
   ``He called me this morning totally out of the blue,'' defense
attorney John Voigt said Tuesday. ``He was in tears. He said that
even though nobody thought so, there was still some good in him.
   ``The only good thing left for him to do was not make (the
victims) testify,'' Voight said.
   Circuit Judge Stanton S. Kaplan asked Buckholtz to explain.
   ``I didn't want to put them through any more,'' replied
Buckholtz, 20.
   Under a deal with the prosecutor, Buckholtz was sentenced to 40
years in prison followed by 15 years of probation. In return for
the guilty plea, prosecutor Kate Kearney agreed to drop charges of
armed kidnapping and aggravated battery.
   Kearny said Buckholtz had rejected that plea-bargain offer a
week ago.
   ``It's been an exceptionally traumatic experience for the
family,'' she said. ``The state offered this to avoid having the
victims exposed to Mr. Buckholtz.''

<TEXT>
   An organized crime informant who rejected an
offer to enter the federal witness protection program has been
found murdered in a California parking lot, authorities said.
   The body of George Peter Yudzevich, 46, was found near a
business-industrial center in Irvine, Calif. He had been shot at
least three times in the head, police said.
   Irvine police said they did not know the motive for his murder,
which was discovered Saturday.
   Yudzevich turned down an offer for federal protection before
testifying last fall at the racketeering trial of Joseph N. Gallo,
76, the reputed former consigliere of the Gambino crime family;
Joseph Armone, 70, the reputed Gambino underboss, and two other
Gambino associates, according to Edward McDonald, head of the
Brooklyn-based Organized Crime Strike Force.
   His testimony against Armone and the two associates was
``critical'' in the trial, which ended in December with the
conviction of all the defendants, McDonald said Tuesday.
   ``We sponsored him for the program and even went so far as to
prepare necessary paperwork, but for his own reasons he chose not
to enter the program,'' McDonald said.
   Yudzevich admitted to being an FBI informant from 1980 to 1985,
McDonald said. He refused to speculate about the motive behind the
slaying.
   Yudzevich also testified in California last fall against alleged
organized crime figure Robert (Fat Bobby) Paduano of Newport Beach,
Calif., who was arrested in February and charged with 73 felony
counts of robbery, burglary, assault and extortion, said Orange
County Deputy District Attorney Wallace Wade.
   Paduano's lawyer, Alan May, said his client denied any knowledge
of or involvement in Yudzevich's murder.
   Yudzevich also had been awaiting a judge's decision on whether
he should be tried for allegedly bilking Orange County investors
out of about $350,000 in a money laundering case, authorities said.

<HEAD>New INS Policy To Accept Misdemeanor Convicts For Amnesty,
Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Undocumented aliens seeking amnesty despite
misdemeanor criminal records may be eligible if the convictions are
more than a year old, a newspaper reported today.
   But amnesty rights activists said the proposed change in
immigration-law standards comes too late.
   ``Immigration has been very lax in coming forward to publicize
this major change,'' said Susan Alva, director of a legalization
appeals project for the Legal Aid Foundation.
   Under the existing U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
policy, immigrants who have been convicted of three or more
misdemeanors, or any felony, are not eligible for amnesty.
   The proposed change would allow immigrants to expunge
misdemeanors from their records and be eligible for amnesty,
according to a report published today in the Los Angeles Herald
Examner.
   Alva estimated that thousands of people, many of whom have been
told by officials that they weren't eligible for legalization,
would be affected by the reported policy shift.
   But Duke Austin, an INS spokesman, disagreed.
   ``I don't think this would dramatically affect the numbers of
people in the program,'' he said.
   In a letter dated Jan. 18, Joe Thomas, director of the INS
western region processing facility for amnesty applications,
explained to an immigrants' rights attorney that ``an expungement
will not remove ineligibility for criminal convictions.''
   However, attorneys from the immigration committee of the
National Lawyers' Guild and the Los Angeles County Public
Defender's office said the INS is now accepting expungements,
though too late to be of use to many immigrants.
   The amnesty deadline is May 5, and Ray Santana, a deputy Los
Angeles County public defender, said it takes a month or longer to
get an expungement.

   City health officials say 25 people
became ill and two had to be hospitalized following a corned beef
and cabbage dinner sponsored by the Ancient Order of Hibernians.
   Richard Wilberg, chief inspector for the city Department of
Public Health, said Tuesday that the meat served at the Saturday
dinner was apparently contaminated during preparation with
staphyloccus, which produced a toxin creating food poisoning.
   He said that 160 people had attended the pre-St. Patrick's Day
dinner at the city's Irish Club and the two people hospitalized
have been released.
   Among those hospitalized was Edward F. O'Connell, president of
the local chapter of the Hibernians.
   ``It's a tough situation,'' O'Connell said. ``We rented the
caterer and they brought everything in cooked.''

   An Arab-American who advocates non-violent

taking part in an illegal gathering, police said.
   Mubarak Awad, 44, was being held at a city police station and
his case was under investigation, police spokesman Rafi Levy told
The Associated Press.
   Levy said the illegal gathering took place on the main road
between Jerusalem and the West Bank city of Nablus, but he had no
further details.
   ``We do understand that Mr. Awad has been taken into custody,
but our understanding was that he was stopped for a traffic
violation,'' said a U.S. Consulate official who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``We have consular officers seeking access to him at
this time.''
   Last year, Israeli officials confiscated Awad's Israeli identity
card and ordered him out of the country in November, when his
three-month tourist visa expired.
   On Monday, Israel's Supreme Court ordered the Interior Ministry
to show within 60 days why Awad had not been expelled.
   Awad, a Palestinian who also has homes both in Jerusalem and
Wapakoneta, Ohio, came under fire after the publication in Hebrew
of his book entitled ``Non-Violent Resistance: A Strategy For the
Occupied Territories.''
   The book urged the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip to refuse to pay taxes, lay down in front of bulldozers
to prevent land confiscation and boycott Isreli products.

<HEAD>Bush Easily Wins In Illinois; Democratic Race Clouded After Simon
Victory</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates GOP delegate figures, Democratic vote percentages,
subbing grafs 27-28 pvs, With nearly ... no delegates</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democrats are searching anew for a
presidential front-runner after the home-state revival of Sen. Paul
Simon, who declared today he has ``as good a shot as anybody''
after his victory over Jesse Jackson in the Illinois primary.
George Bush won easily in the Republican contest, although he still
had to contend with a battered but dogged Bob Dole.
   The candidates went on spring break today after a grueling month
that featured 20-odd primaries and caucuses in both parties.
   ``This is the state, it will be remembered, which locked it up
for George Bush,'' Gov. James Thompson said after Illinois
shattered Dole's comeback bid and brought Bush two-thirds of the
way to a GOP nominating majority.
   The Democrats had no luxury to talk of locking up anything. The
race for a nominating majority of delegates was a dead heat between
Jackson and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis with Kansas and
Michigan next up on the calendar.
   However, Dukakis was expecting to pick up about 100 uncounted
delegates from caucuses already held in Minnesota, Texas and
Washington state.
   ``Now we move on to Michigan,'' said Dukakis, ``where there are
no favorite sons. The field is wide open.''
   Jackson, in an interview on NBC-TV today, congratulated Simon on
his victory but in almost the same breath seemed to dismiss it as
Illinois voters paying ``respects to a sitting senator'' who had
focused on his home state while Jackson was competing in the Super
Tuesday states.
   Simon, on the other hand, said on ABC-TV that his Illinois win
showed he is in the thick of a battle that will go all the way to
the Democratic National Convention this summer.
   ``I don't know who out there will emerge, but I think Paul Simon
has as good a shot as anyone,'' he said.
   Simon said in several interviews that his relative lack of
campaign money wasn't a big problem, though he concluded his
appearance on CBS-TV by saying with a smile, ``Any of your viewers
who want to send in a contribution, I'll be happy to accept it.''
   ``I don't believe we have any front-runners,'' Dukakis said
after finishing what he described as ``a respectable third'' in
Illinois. He said in his discussions with Democratic Party leaders
around the country ``there is an overwhelming sentiment that we
should get behind a nominee.''
   Jackson finished second in the duel of favorite sons, and said,
``Jesse Jackson, in popular vote and delegates, is on top of the
race.''
   In fact, the Associated Press delegate survey showed Dukakis
with 464.5 and Jackson with 460.55. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 354.8;
Rep. Richard Gephardt 145, and Simon 171.5 delegates.
   The big losers in Illinois were Republicans Dole and Pat
Robertson and Democrats Gore and Gephardt.
   ``We're staying in,'' said Dole after absorbing another beating
at the hands of the vice president.
   ``Illinois has spoken loud and clear and strong,'' said Bush,
who now has won 18 straight primaries _ 16 of them one week ago on
Super Tuesday.
   There was relatively little campaign activity today, after five
frantic weeks in which nearly half the delegates to the Democratic
and Republican conventions were chosen.
   Gephardt was campaigning in Michigan and Gore was in Kansas.
Dukakis had an appearance scheduled in New York, but the rest of
the candidates were off the campaign trail.
   Kansas Democrats hold caucuses this weekend and both parties
have primaries scheduled Saturday in Puerto Rico.
   Next Tuesday, the only event in the presidential struggle is a
primary to select the seven delegates allocated to Democrats abroad.
   The next major battleground for the Democrats was Michigan,
which holds party caucuses on March 26.
   Gephardt made little effort in Illinois, pinning his hopes on
Michigan with its strong union vote.
   But Gore spent about $200,000 on advertising in Illinois and
ended up with only 5 percent of the vote. Yet, he insisted, there
would be better days ahead. ``This race has a long way to run
yet,'' said the Tennessee senator.
   For the Republicans, the next big test was Connecticut, with a
primary on March 29. That should produce another big win for Bush,
who grew up in the state, which his father represented in the U.S.
Senate.
   There were two presidential votes in Illinois _ a non-binding
popularity contest and the election of convention delegates.
   Bush and Simon were the big winners in both.
   With nearly all the votes counted, Bush was getting about 54
percent of the popular vote and winning 66 delegates. Dole was
receiving 36 percent of the vote, and winning 16 delegates.
Robertson was getting 7 percent of the vote and no delegates.
   Simon, running stronger than expected, was getting 43 percent of
the popular vote and picking up 136 delegates. Jackson was
receiving 31 percent of the vote and 37 delegates, while Dukakis
was getting 17 percent of the vote, but no delegates. Gore and
Gephardt trailed with 5 percent and 2 percent of the vote
respectively, and no delegates.
   Good news for Dukakis came from far-away Washington state, where
Democratic officials released results from 65 percent of their
March 8 caucuses. Dukakis led with 45 percent of the vote, to 35
percent for Jackson and 14 percent uncommitted. Simon had 4
percent. Overall, Washington will send 65 delegates to the national
convention.
   Robertson said he'd have to reassess his candidacy _ the
political euphemism for preparing to drop out _ if he got less than
5 percent of the vote in Illinois. He got 7 percent, but has
stopped talking about being the 1988 GOP nominee.
   Simon declared, ``This is a new beginning for the Paul Simon
candidacy.''

<HEAD>Lawyers Appeal to High Court to Stop Hanging of Sharpeville Six</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for the ``Sharpeville
Six'' today filed an appeal with the Supreme Court for a stay of
execution for the six blacks, whose scheduled hangings have
prompted worldwide cries for clemency.
   Attorney Prakash Diar filed the request on the basis of new
evidence relating to allegations that police assaulted and
pressured a state witness into giving false evidence against two of
the defendants.
   The hearing was scheduled for Thursday morning. The executions
are scheduled at dawn Friday at Pretoria Central Prison.
   A finding of new evidence is the only grounds available to stop
the hangings, since President P.W. Botha said Tuesday he had turned
down the last appeal to save the five men and one woman.
   The six were convicted of murder in connection with the Sept. 3,
1984 mob killing of black township councilor Jacob Dlamini in
Sharpeville, about 40 miles south of Johannesburg.
   The attorneys submitted documents stating that Joseph Manete, a
black trial witness, was forced by police to say in a sworn
affidavit that he had seen two of the defendants at the scene, when
he really did not.
   Manete testified in the non-jury trial under protection of
anonymity. The attorneys tried to question him during the trial
about his allegations, which were made to his attorney. The court

Sharpeville riots were provoked by the local council's decision to
raise rents.

<TEXT>
   George Bush, with another Republican
primary victory under his belt, celebrated his ``great and
convincing'' win in Illinois, while backers proclaimed he has the
GOP presidential nomination sewed up.
   ``This is the state, it will be remembered, which locked it up
for George Bush,'' said James Thompson, Illinois' four-term
Republican governor. Thompson served as Bush's state chairman and
campaigned with him all over Illinois.
   ``Who says nice guys finish last?'' a buoyant Bush asked
supporters at a victory celebration in this northwest Chicago
suburb.
   ``Thank you, Illinois,'' he said.
   The vice president was returning to Washington today for a
campaign hiatus.
   Bush resoundingly beat his nearest rival, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.
Former television evangelist Pat Robertson ran a distant third with
7 percent.
   ``Illinois has spoken loud and clear and strong, and so now we
go on, right down to the wire in November, and with your help we'll
win Illinois in November,'' he told supporters who waved red, white
and blue balloons and chanted ``Bush '88.''
   With a victory in the first big industrial-state primary on top
of his Super Tuesday sweep, Bush said his campaign themes had won
nationwide approval.
   ``Wherever there's a primary, I am going to be there taking the
Illinois message,'' he said. ``Ours is a national message for a
national campaign.''
   Backers said Bush was virtually assured of winning the
nomination.
   ``I think the race is going to be wrapped up when Bob Dole
decides to drop out, but the numbers certainly would indicate that
it's all over,'' said Ed Murnane, deputy director of the Bush
campaign in Illinois.

<HEAD>Kremlin Adviser Says He Warned Soviets About Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent Soviet adviser warned the Kremlin less
than a month after Soviet troops entered Afghanistan that the
action would derail efforts to curb the arms race, he said in a
letter published today.
   Economist Oleg T. Bogomolov said he sent a report in 1979 to the
Communist Party's ruling Politburo that outlined the potential
dangers to Soviet foreign policy and public opinion.
   ``In a situation report delivered to the appropriate levels on
Jan. 20, 1980, the hopeless and detrimental aspects of that action
were stated,'' Bogomolov wrote in a letter published in the weekly
Literary Gazette.
   Bogomolov has been head of the Institute of Economics of the
World Socialist System for nearly 20 years and is a respected
adviser on development in Kremlin-allied nations.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to replace
one pro-Moscow leadership with another and to back it against an
anti-communist Moslem insurgency. An estimated 115,000 Soviet
soldiers remain in Afghanistan to support the Kabul government now
headed by President Najib.
   The Soviets have said they will withdraw their troops if
Pakistan, which represents the Afghan rebels, agrees to a peace
proposal with Kabul. The two sides have been meeting for
U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Geneva.
   ``For the first time since World War II emerged the possibility
of a military conflict in which, unlike in Korea or Vietnam, we
would have to fight with our own troops,'' Bogomolov quoted his
report as saying.
   ``The report stated that as a result of that action detente was
blocked and political efforts to limit the arms race were
liquidated,'' Bogomolov wrote. ``There occurred a considerable
consolidation of the anti-Soviet front in governments surrounding
the USSR from the West to the East.''
   The intervention in Afghanistan damaged Kremlin relations with
developing countries, especially in Moslem nations, the economic
theorist said he warned in the report.
   The letter gave no indication what, if any, response Bogomolov
received from the Kremlin leadership.

<HEAD>Inquest Finds Theologian Killed Self After Writing Critical Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Church of England theologian committed
suicide after writing a controversial article accusing the
archbishop of Canterbury of weakness and indecision, a coroner
ruled today.
   The Rev. Gareth Bennett, a traditionalist figure in the church,
wrote the traditionally unsigned preface to ``Crockford's Clerical
Directory 1987-88,'' the church's own reference book listing
Anglican clergy.
   The article, published Dec. 2, started a furor in the state
church because it was widely interpreted as the opening shot in a
campaign to pressure Archbishop Robert Runcie, 66, into retiring
early and to block the appointment of a liberal to replace him.
   Runcie is spiritual head of the church and the world's 70
million Anglicans.
   Bennett, 58, wrote in a diary four days before his Dec. 7 death
that ``I should be lucky to weather this business through without
disaster.''
   He was found dead in his fume-filled car at his home in Oxford,
western England. Bennett had purchased a hose pipe on Dec. 5 that
was used to siphon fumes into his car from the exhaust, the inquest
heard.
   Oxfordshire Coroner Nicholas Gardiner said the tenor of
Bennett's diary entries ``changes dramatically in the last few days
of his life'' and there was ample evidence to suggest Bennett was
under extreme pressure.
   ``He decided that he had only one course of action open to him
and took that course of action fully aware of what the results
would be,'' Gardiner said. ``Accordingly, my verdict must be that
he took his own life.''

<TEXT>
   Negligence and dereliction of duty have caused
the deaths of 11,700 people over the past three years, a top
Chinese official was quoted today as saying.
   The official China Daily quoted an official of the Supreme
People's Procuratorate, the nation's top prosecutor's office. He
was not identified by name.
   The official said accidents resulting from ``rampant
bureaucratic bunglings'' and negligence cost the state $378 million
in direct economic losses over the same period.
   He said there had been an unexpected rise in the number of
serious cases of negligence involving criminal liability over the
past two years.
   He gave no reason for the increase. Previous reports have linked
China's serious problem with industrial accidents to both inept
bureaucracy and economic reforms which have decentralized industry
and encouraged the establishment of hundreds of thousands of small,
often poorly regulated factories.
   The official said most criminal cases are in the fields of
construction, mining and transport, forcing the resignation of
several senior government leaders.
   The head of the Forestry Ministry was forced from office last
year because of his poor handling of a disastrous forest fire and
the railways minister stepped down earlier this month to take the
blame for three fatal train accidents in January.
   The official said the procuratorate will impose stricter
punishment for people who have committed crimes of derelection or
have caused major accidents due to negligence of duty.
   Organizations caught trying to cover up such crimes or which
delay reporting them will also face severe criminal punishment, he
said.

   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci and Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov today held the
first such high-level military talks in an atmosphere characterized
as friendly and non-pressured.
   ``The tone has been very positive and cooperative throughout,''
said Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard. ``We are pleased with the way
things are going.''
   The two discussed the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks,
implementation of the treaty to eliminate medium-range superpower
nuclear missiles, and the size of the respective armed forces, said
Howard.
   They also discussed U.S. allegations that the Soviets violated
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty by building a phased-array
radar far from the Soviet border in Siberia, said Howard. The pact
requires such radars to be along the border.
   Howard declined to give full details of the talks, saying that
Carlucci and Yazov reserved that right for news conferences both
plan at the end of the talks Thursday.
   Opening the morning session at the U.S. Embassy, said Howard,
Yazov ``commented that the room ... was a very small room, and said
there is a saying in Russian that although we have close quarters,
we shouldn't quarrel.''
   ``Everyone got a laugh out of that,'' said Howard.
   ``The main point that Mr. Yazov made in the beginning was that
he wanted to have useful discussions without having the pressure of
negotiations ... to arrive at some sort of agreement,'' Howard said.
   Carlucci welcomed Yazov to the opening round.
   Inside, the two men, flanked by about 10 aides apiece, faced
each other across a long table at the end of which stood a relief
map of Europe, the area defended by the opposing forces of the
North Atlantic Treaty Alliance and Warsaw Pact.
   The two men exchanged greetings, but made no public remarks. It
was the first ever business meeting between U.S. and Soviet defense
secretaries.
   Reporters and photographers were ushered out of the room as the
first, three-hour session began.
   Carlucci and Yazov ate lunch at the residence of U.S. Ambassador
Faith Ryan Whittlesey before the afternoon session at the Soviet
embassy.
   On Thursday, Carlucci and Yazov were to eat breakfast at the
residence of Soviet Ambassador Zoya Novozhilova before their third
and concluding session. Carlucci told reporters earlier that he
hoped Yazov could give him concrete evidence of a highly publicized
new Soviet military doctrine.
   Despite extensive Soviet press commentary on the Kremlin
doctrine of reasonable or defensive sufficiency, he said he had
seen seen ``absolutely no practical change.''
   ``If anything, their military continues to grow. They continue
to modernize,'' Carlucci said Tuesday.
   Yazov said before he left Moscow that he hoped for ``frank,
constructive discussion'' on arms control issues including
strategic arms, nuclear testing, chemical and conventional weapons.
   Carlucci emphasized that he did not want the meeting to open a
``parallel channel'' to on-going superpower arms negotiations in
Geneva.
   Soviet journalists covering the session said they had been told
it was likely to produce no dramatic announcements, but to serve as
an ``impulse'' to other negotiations.

<HEAD>With PM-Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>

   Here are excerpts from Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's speech Wednesday to the Yugoslav Parliament:
   ``We will have to thoroughly examine the question of improving
inter-nationality relations, one of the most important and delicate
issues in a multinational country such as ours. Basic positions
here are firm.
   ``Recently, when the 70th anniversary of the Great October
Revolution was formally celebrated in Moscow, we spoke with a
justified sense of gratification of the results of the Leninist
nationalities policy of how much had been done in the country to
upgrade the economy and culture of the many peoples inhabiting our
land, so that they might live in friendship and accord.
   ``Whatever constituent or autonomous republic or region we take,
it is now bound by thousands of threads to all other parts of the
sountry, and it has indisoluble links within the integrated
economic and political complex ... It would be a mistake, however,
to regard the life of nations and relations of nations as something
settled once and for all.
   ``There are certain difficulties inherited from the past. There
are problems that emerged in the course of time prompted by changes
in economic life and social relationships and in the consciousness
of people.
   ``We are determined to secure democratic solutions to these
problems which would correspond to the interests of each and every
nation and in the family of Soviet nations and our entire socialist
society.
   ``I should like to stress that the changes in our society are
closely linked with the activity of the Communist Party. The
Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the initiator of perestroika
(change). In the current crucial stage, its role as the Soviet
people's political vanguard is particularly great. And we are
convinced that the party can carry out the current responsible
tasks it is confronted with, not by methods of command and
administration, but by putting itself at the head of the mass
movement for a revolutionary renewal of society, and by
consolidating two-way connections with the working class, the
farmers, the intelligentsia and all social strata.''
   ``We are implementing our perestroika in keeping with the
conditions and needs of our own country, and we have no intention
whatsoever to palm it off as a universal model or recipe that would
be good for all.
   ``Today, the Mediterranean is one of the most explosive regions
of the world, an intricate knot of conflicting interests abounding
in huge military arsenals which are continuing to grow. There is no
other enclosed sea with the same concentration of naval forces.
   ``For us, the Mediterranean base is no remote, out-of-the-way
area. It is close to our southern borders, and it is crossed by the
only sea route linking our southern ports with the world's oceans.
   ``Naturally, we are interested in routes of peace, rather than
those of war, passing here. In this connection, I would like to
declare that we fully support the program of security measures
advanced by the Mediterranean nonaligned states at their (Brunei)
meeting. It is a sound basis for broad and fruitful dialogue on the
problems of the region.
   ``Along with the earlier Soviet proposals to reduce military
potential in the Mediterranean area, we would like to advance
additional proposals for consideration to the international
community.
   ``Reaffirming our readiness to withdraw the Soviet naval forces
along with those of the United States, from the Mediterranean. We
suggest that this should not be put off indefinitely ... and that
as a first step, the number of ships in the two countries' naval
potential here should be frozen as from July 1 this year.
Thereafter, ceilings would be set for them.
   ``Second, even before general confidence-building measures are
agreed upon in the spirit of the Stockholm accords, the Soviet
Union and the United States could give each other and all the other
Mediterranean countries advance notice of any redistribution of
warships and of naval exercises. They could also invite observers
to them.
   ``Third, our country will fully support the elaboration by
Mediterranean and other interested countries of principles and
methods assuring the security of intensive shipping, especially in
international straits.''

   The five Democratic presidential contenders
all made it out of Illinois alive, with Jesse Jackson declaring
today that ``Illinois voters were quite generous to both favorite
sons'' and Paul Simon claiming momentum for the primaries still to
come.
   Simon's victory over Jackson has rendered talk of a nationwide
Democratic front-runner meaningless and given new boost to
discussion of a brokered national convention next summer.
   Both Simon and Jackson said today that they would participate if
Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk called a summit to close ranks behind
a probable nominee if no one emerged from the primaries with enough
delegates to win.
   But Simon said on ABC, ``I am not optimistic that it will
provide answers.''
   He said that after his victory in Illinois, ``I think I'm going
to do well'' in the contests yet to come.
   Jackson, appearing on NBC, acknowledged that Simon was ``back in
the race.''
   ``The field is wide open,'' said Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, the national leader in delegates but a third-place
finisher in Illinois.
   ``We're about halfway home. All sorts of things can happen,''
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, a non-candidate, said Tuesday night in
an interview on ABC's ``Nightline.''
   Illinois marked a turning point in the nominating calendar, out
of the South and into the Northern and Midwestern states. After
Michigan's caucuses on Saturday (138 delegates), Connecticut,
Wisconsin (81), New York (255) and Pennsylvania (178) all cast
their votes in primaries over a six-week period.
   Winners and losers alike hailed the results of Tuesday's primary
that gave Simon the gift of political life and elevated
fellow-favorite son Jackson to within a few votes of wresting the
national delegate lead from Dukakis.
   Dukakis, however, is expecting to reap some 100 delegates from
uncounted caucuses already held in Minnesota, Texas and Washington
state.
   ``This is a new beginning for the Paul Simon candidacy,'' said
the senator as he celebrated his triumph. ``I intend to do well in
succeeding states.''
   ``I think I will do respectably well in Michigan, then in
Wisconsin and New York I think I will do very well.''
   In a dig at Dukakis, he said the Massachusetts governor ``spent
more than $500,000 and didn't wind up with a single delegate.''
Simon has his own vulnerability of course; he couldn't win
next-door Iowa and bypassed the entire South and more on Super
Tuesday.
   Jackson said, ``I finished second, it seems in Illinois.'' But
he took a look at the overall popular vote for the states to hold
primaries and caucuses thus far and said, ``I'm a winner. I am the
leading contender for the Democratic nomination. I am where every
candidate wishes he could be tonight.''
   Jackson is hoping to maneuver around Detroit Mayor Coleman Young
_ one of the few prominent black officials to endorse Dukakis or
any other non-Jackson Democrat _ to build his Michigan support.
   Dukakis, the leader in delegates nationwide, finished a distant
third in Illinois. He failed in a $250,000 advertising campaign
designed to siphon off enough of Simon's white support to drop the
Illinois senator into second place and force his withdrawal from
the campaign.
   ``I don't get disappointed,'' Dukakis said. ``We did what I
characterize as a respectable third.'' He added, ``Now we move on
to Michigan where there are no favorite sons.''
   The Massachusetts governor has several dozen staff aides in
Michigan, and is counting on the friendship of Gov. James
Blanchard, Mayor Coleman Young and former United Auto Workers union
president Douglas Fraser to aid his cause.
   Albert Gore Jr. finished fourth in Illinois, and aides said
despite his strong Super Tuesday showing a week ago, he has yet to
decide where to concentrate his efforts in the North and Midwest.
``The outcome means that this race is even more wide open than ever
before,'' said the Tennessee senator.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri was last in Illinois and went
to bed without talking to reporters. But he was first on the air
with television commercials in Michigan in what aides said was a
make-or-break contest for him. Gephardt hopes his appeal for
tougher trade policies will appeal to the state's large unionized
automobile labor force and is counting on picking up agricultural
support as well.
   ``I feel we did as well as we could in Illinois. I just didn't
feel it was worth the effort to go in and put in a lot of resources
to get votes in their favorite-son situation,'' Gephardt said today
in Kalamazoo.
   ``The race is wide open. It has been right along. I think if I
can get a good result in Michigan, which I think I can, I'm going
to be back in the middle of this thing and have a great chance to
be the nominee,'' he said.
   Said Gore: ``The outcome means this race is even more wide open
than ever before ... The results ... make it more likely we will go
to a second ballot'' before picking a winner at the convention.
   But Dukakis, the best-financed and best-organized contender,
shuddered at the talk. ``I've been making a number of calls around
the country to key Democrats and there is an overwhelming sentiment
that we should get behind a nominee.''

   Relatives and close friends attended
memorial services today for 17 soldiers killed last week in the
collision of two helicopters during a night training exercise.
   Soldiers and dignitaries, including Gov. Wallace Wilkinson,
filled the 450-seat main post chapel. An opened Bible rested on a
simple altar.
   ``I have flown personally with each of these men. I can tell you
without reservation that they truly loved what they were doing,''
said Lt. Col. Joseph A. Fucci, commander of the 101st Aviation
Regiment's 5th Brigade.
   ``We all share in the loss of these men. And though all the
grief that we feel does not begin to compare with the sorrow being
felt by their wives and their families, our hearts and our prayers
go out to you.''
   Seven aviation flight helmets mounted atop sabers and M-16
assault rifles standing next to seven pair of boots to represent
those victims from the fort's aviation brigade.
   ``Over the last week we have expressed our sympathies to
families, friends and fellow soldiers with our heads down, unable
to find the right words, if any at all, and an emptiness felt
within,'' said Maj. Paul J. Pozorski, Sr, acting commander of the
aviation regiment's 1st Battalion.
   One service was held for members of the 101st Aviation Brigade,
a second for members of the 502nd Infantry Regiment. Both units
lost members in the crash.
   Thirteen infantrymen and helicopter crew members died when their
craft, returning to Campbell Army Airfield from a night training
exercise in a formation with two other helicopters, was struck
broadside by a second copter on a separate mission, Army spokesmen
said.
   All four soldiers on the second craft also died, in what the
Army said was its worst aviation accident since 248 Fort Campbell
servicemen were killed in a jet crash in Canada in 1985. The two
other helicopters flying in formation were not damaged and landed
safely.
   An investigation by the Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, Ala.,
was to finish its work at the crash scene six miles from the
airfield by Friday and reconvene at Fort Rucker, officials said.
   The safety center's report on the accident is expected within
three months.
   One crash investigator has said initial findings indicated that
``human and environmental factors'' _ and not mechanical failure _
were suspected as responsible for the collision.

   The body buried in the police chief's front
yard turned out to be that of his wife's former husband, and now
authorities are trying to find out how the man died and how the
body ended up where it did.
   State pathologist Dr. Roger Fossum was to continue an autopsy
today, according to Gregory Swope, senior assistant attorney
general.
   Dental records identified the remains as those of Russell Bean,
Swope said Tuesday. Bean disappeared 10 years ago; his wife,
Sylvia, married the police chief, Robert Chambers, a year after
Bean's disappearance.
   Sources close to the investigation told The Associated Press
that police began digging in Chambers' front yard following
revelations by his father, Clifton Chambers, who died last
Wednesday.
   Police discovered the bones on Monday after three days of
digging.
   The Keene Sentinel reported that police investigators learned
the elder Chambers confessed to his daughter that Bean died
accidentally in a fist fight after hitting his head on a rock.
Clifton Chambers also told his daughter that he helped bury Bean's
body, the newspaper said.
   The attorney general's office, which has handled all news
releases in the case, has declined to comment on the source of its
information.
   Swope said only that the dig ``was undertaken when allegations
arose that a corpse was buried at that location approximately 10
years ago.''
   No charges have been filed in the case.
   Chambers, 36, and his wife, Sylvia, about 35, have been secluded
at a friend's home and have not spoken with reporters.
   Chambers, who has lived in the town of 600 most of his life,
three years ago took over as part-time chief. He also is part-time
chief of nearby Gilsum. He took an indefinite leave of absence from
the Marlow job on Saturday.
   Sylvia Chambers is the town welfare director and has worked with
the Girl Scouts and the cancer society.
   The couple lives in a five-room, 1{-story cabin with their four
teen-age children by previous marriages.
   This is the second time in five years that Marlow has been
shocked by a criminal investigation.
   In 1983, Audrey Hilley, who became known as the ``black widow,''
was arrested in Marlow. She had been convicted in Alabama of
poisoning her husband in 1975 and later trying to poison her
daughter.
   While a fugitive, she married a man in Florida, moved with him
to Marlow, left on a trip to Texas, faked her death and returned to
him posing as her twin sister. She died last year of exposure after
failing to return from a furlough from a women's prison in Alabama.

<HEAD>Theologians Agree Deafness Cure Was Miracle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of theologians has ruled the
unexplained healing of a youth's hearing impairment was a miracle
attributed to Mother Katharine Drexel, advancing efforts to have
the heiress-turned-nun declared a Roman Catholic saint.
   The panel's decision will be reviewed by the 19 cardinals of the
Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which will take up the case
after Easter and recommend any further action to Pope John Paul II.
   A group of doctors said in December they could find no medical
explanation for the healing in 1974 of Robert J. Gutherman, now 28,
of Bensalem, after an infection had destroyed the hearing in his
right ear.
   He regained hearing after his family and members of the order
Miss Drexel founded, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for
Indians and Colored People, prayed for her intervention.
   Miss Drexel, who died in 1955 at the age of 96, was declared
``venerable'' on Jan. 26, 1987. If the theologians' decision is
upheld by the cardinals and the pope concurs, she would be declared
``blessed,'' the final step before sainthood.
   Before she could be declared a saint, a second miracle would
have to be credited to her.
   Miss Drexel founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament in 1891
and gave $20 million toward helping blacks and American Indians.
   ``I am elated,'' said Sister Faith Okerson, executive secretary
of the Cornwell Heights-based order. ``It's a real gift to us and
our nation.''
   But Sister Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for the order, said
Miss Drexel would have been happier to learn about the appointment
Tuesday of Eugene A. Marino as archbishop of Atlanta.
   Marino, who will be the first black American archbishop,
attended an elementary school founded by the Sisters of the Blessed
Sacrament in Biloxi, Miss.
   ``She was not one for a lot of fuss about herself,'' Sister
Lynch said.

   Israeli police today detained an Arab-American
peace activist and a Palestinian was killed in clashes with troops
in the occupied territories, where Israel banned travel and
long-distance phone calls.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin defended Israel's move Tuesday to
cut telephone links between foreign countries and the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, and to ban travel by Palestinians in the occupied
territories.
   The restrictions were aimed at hampering Palestine Liberation
Organization activists, whom Israel blames for keeping alive unrest
that has claimed 97 Arab lives since Dec. 8.
   The army said one Palestinian died and six were wounded in
protests near Tulkarm, 40 miles northwest of Jerusalem. The army
said the circumstances of the death were under investigation and
that no other details were available.
   The Arab-owned Palestine Press Service identified the victim as
60-year-old Salim al Yehyeh and said he died after soldiers threw
tear gas into his home in a refugee camp on the outskirts of
Tulkarm.
   Hospital officials said Israeli soldiers shot and wounded eight
Palestinians, six of them in the Gaza Strip and two in the West
Bank.
   Arab-American Mubarak Awad, 44, was being held at a city police
station after he was arrested for attending an illegal gathering,
police spokesman Rafi Levy said. Levy said the illegal gathering
took place on the main road between Jerusalem and the West Bank
city of Nablus, but he had no further details.
   Last year, Israeli officials confiscated Awad's Israeli identity
card and ordered him out of the country in November, when his
three-month tourist visa expired. On Monday, Israel's Supreme Court
ordered the Interior Ministry to show within 60 days why Awad had
not been expelled.
   Awad, a Palestinian who also has homes both in Jerusalem and
Wapakoneta, Ohio, came under fire after the publication in Hebrew
of his book entitled ``Non-Violent Resistance: A Strategy For the
Occupied Territories.''
   The book urged the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip to refuse to pay taxes, lay down in front of bulldozers
to prevent land confiscation and boycott Isreli products.
   In other developments, a PLO-ordered general strike entered its
second day today, keeping most Arab workers from their jobs in
Israel.
   Rabin told high school students that nightly curfews in Gaza
were necessary to ``reduce their (the Arab activists') capability
to move by night, to prepare explosives ... to obstruct roads that
carry workers to Israel.''
   According to army estimates, about 2,600 Palestinians have been
arrested on riot-related charges, most for throwing stones.
   The telephone and travel restrictions have a two-fold purpose:
to demonstrate Israel's determination to regain control of the
streets and to keep Palestinian activists from receiving telephone
instructions from abroad or from moving freely between the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel seized the territories in the 1967
Middle East war.
   The ban on direct-dial overseas telephone calls was not likely
to be completely effective, however, since it excluded Arab
neighborhoods in east Jerusalem, where 130,000 Palestinians live.
   The army-run territorial government will lift restrictions when
authorities feel a change and the situation calms, informed sources
said.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also held out
the possibility other steps would be taken, including the closing
of West Bank bridges to Jordan. The bridges are an avenue for trade
and travel, and Israeli officials estimate more than 1 million
people cross annually.
   The daily Hadashot newspaper today said authorities were
considering cutting off electricity to some areas, banning export
of some products and closing markets.
   In recent days, the focus of the PLO campaign has shifted from
street confrontations to civil disobedience, such as the
resignations of Arab police and tax collectors.
   Israeli authorities each day this week have imposed new
restrictions on Palestinians.

   Three children died today when a van
ran off a coastal road and plunged into the chilly waters of Weeks
Bay, where it remained submerged for three hours, state troopers
said.
   A woman driving the van escaped and was taken by helicopter to
the University of South Alabama Medical Center, where she was being
questioned byb authorities.
   The driver was identified as 29-year-old Aimee Dees of Chatom.
The children were not immediately identified.
   State troopers said the van apparently ran off a county road
between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.The road dead-ends into the secluded
bay, about seven miles south of Point Clear.
   A group of people on the beach near the county road were huddled
around a campfire when they saw the van run into the water. They
pulled Mrs. Dees out, but didn't know the children were still in
the vehicle.
   Mrs. Dees was dazed and in shock and unable to immediately
describe what happened, authorities said.
   Rescue workers searched in 30-degree weather for three hours
before locating the vehicle.

   Burt Lancaster was the fast-talking tough guy,
James Stewart his drawling partner with homespun common sense as
they rode into town to fight for a principle _ only this time it
was real life, not a movie.
   The two Hollywood legends began a two-day whirl of lobbying in
Congress and on television talk shows Tuesday to plead for the
preservation of their film classics against modern moguls out to
``make a buck.''
   Lancaster shook his finger at a packed room of reporters,
arguing passionately for a halt to the controversial coloring of
black and white films.
   Media entrepreneur Ted Turner has led the colorization field,
releasing computer-colored versions of such classics as
``Casablanca'' and Stewart's ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
   ``All of this is done for them to make a buck,'' said Lancaster.
``Let them go out and make an honest buck.''
   Stewart told reporters in his halting cadence that he agreed
with Lancaster, ``but for me to say the same thing would take so
very much longer, I better not say it.''
   The two were joined in their rounds by directors Peter
Bogdanovich, Fred Zinnemann and several other top American
filmmakers. The Hollywood push for legislation included testimony
before a congressional committee two weeks ago by directors Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas.
   Stewart said he came to Washington because he was appalled by
the colorization of Frank Capra's ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' after
Turner bought the rights to the movie.
   ``As Frank's health deteriorated, he found to his horror that
`It's a Wonderful Life' was one of the first films that was
colorized. It broke his heart,'' an emotional Stewart said.
   ``I am determined to do whatever I can to make things right for
Frank Capra,'' he said.
   The directors and actors want Congress to expand the nation's
copyright laws to give directors and writers perpetual ``moral
rights'' over what can be done to their works.
   Under a plan supported by the Directors Guild of America, those
who hold exhibition rights to completed movies would not be allowed
to make changes _ such as adding color _ without the filmmakers'
permission.
   ``I see myself today in movies where the story has been
distorted and the movie chopped up,'' said Lancaster. ``Yet, my
name is on it. I think, `What are they doing to me?'
   ``They don't own me. They're using my name as a kind of draw.
That's felonious, really.''
   Although he was passionate before the news cameras, drawing
memories of his roles as a tough guy dating back to the 1940s,
Lancaster said he toned down his private performance before members
of Congress.
   ``We're dealing with politicians _ we have to be a little
political too,'' he said.

   NBC's ``Aaron's Way'' made it into the top 10 in
the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings as the television season winds down
and the networks begin giving spring tryouts to potential series.
   Last week's ratings were skewed by pre-emptions for college
basketball and the Rev. Billy Graham's televised fund-raising, but
NBC still won, taking the top five places.
   Network analysts estimate that about a quarter of the country's
network affiliates pre-empted network shows for the Graham crusade
on Friday night, lowering the networks' ratings. Graham's show is
syndicated, so its ratings aren't included in the weekly Nielsens.
   With only five weeks left, ABC is holding onto second place in
the season-long ratings race, thanks to high ratings for its Winter
Olympics coverage.
   NBC won the week that ended Sunday with an average, prime-time
rating of 15.9. CBS had a 12.7 and ABC 11.8. The season-to-date
averages are NBC 16.3, ABC 14.0 and CBS 13.6.
   To make up the 0.4 point it lags behind ABC, CBS would have to
beat ABC by two points each of the remaining five weeks of the
season, an unlikely prospect.
   CBS, however, has rebounded in news ratings. For the week that
ended Friday, the ``CBS Evening News'' had an average rating of
11.1, its second-straight victory. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had
a 10.2 and ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.4.
   The rating is the percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions.
   After a lengthy reign at the top of the news ratings last
summer, NBC is now struggling in third, although the close rankings
make the news race virtually a three-way tie.
   NBC analyst Gerald Jaffe said results of the November sweeps
showed NBC with a disadvantage in local news lead-in. NBC
affiliates had an average rating of 11.5, which ``Nightly News''
improved on, to 11.9.
   CBS had the best advantage. Its affiliates had an average rating
of 12.9, and the network newscast improved that to 13.1. ABC
affiliates averaged a 12.0 rating and the network broadcast was a
12.3.
   ``Network news is an island in a sea of local news,'' said
Jaffe. ``If the local news is going down, there's not much you can
do to keep the network news from going down, too.''
   NBC continued to dominate prime time. ``The Cosby Show'' was No.
1 even though the episode was a repeat. Next was NBC's ``Cheers,''
``A Different World,'' ``Night Court'' and ``Golden Girls.'' The
rest of the top 10: ``Murder, She Wrote'' CBS, ``The People's
Choice Awards'' CBS, ``60 Minutes'' CBS, ``Growing Pains'' ABC.
``Aaron's Way,'' a new NBC series starring Merlin Olsen as the
patron of an Amish family trying to cope in California, made its
debut at No. 10, the best showing of the crop of new series getting
spring tryouts.
   The premiere movie of ABC's new series ``Probe'' did well,
landing in 28th place, but its regular time period on Thursday
didn't make a dent in the ratings and was ranked 60th of 68.
   ABC seems to have successfully transplanted ``Growing Pains''
from Tuesday to Wednesday, where it was strong enough to pull
``Head of the Class'' into 11th place.
   Katharine Hepburn proved she is still a ratings draw. Her NBC
movie ``Laura Lansing Slept Here'' was 12th.
   CBS did make headway against NBC's Thursday's lineup with the
debut of ``48 Hours'' in its new time period opposite ``Cosby.''
Last week's documentary on runaways ranked 34th with a rating of
22.9.
   The lowest-rated shows of the week were: ``Buck James,''
``Probe,'' ``Ohara,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Hotel,'' ``Barry Manilow,
Swing Street,'' ABC's Super Tuesday coverage, ``The Thorns,'' CBS'
Super Tuesday coverage and ``The Redeye Express.''

   Attackers fired pistols and
hurled hand grenades at a graveside service for three slain Irish
Republican Army guerrillas today, killing three people and injuring
34, police reported. One man was arrested.
   Thousands of mourners threw themselves to the ground as the
explosions ripped across the Milltown Roman Catholic cemetery,
while hundreds of others raced across the graves pursuing a
suspected attacker.
   One attacker, weaving and dodging between gravestones, flung a
hand grenade at the pursuing mourners.
   Organizers of the funeral for the guerrillas, who were shot by
British troops in Gibraltar, immediately blamed Protestant
paramilitaries for the attack.
   Police moved in to surround the cemetery and a dozen ambulances
ferried the 34 injured, including several young children hit by
gunfire, to the nearby Royal Victoria Hospital.
   The three dead, all men, were not immediately identified. A
hospital spokeswoman said one of the injured, a woman, was in
serious condition and three men also were gravely wounded.
   ``It's obvious it was an attack by Loyalist (Protestant)
movements,'' Martin McGuinness, vice president of Sinn Fein, the
outlawed IRA's legal political front, told reporters in the
cemetery.
   The violence erupted about 15 yards away as the flag-draped
coffins of Mairead Farrell, 31, Sean Savage, 24, and Daniel McCann,
30, were being lowered into a single grave. The unarmed trio were
shot March 6 by British troops in Gibraltar, and British
authorities alleged the three were on a bombing mission.
   Within hours of the cemetery attack, youths hijacked and set
fire to a bus in the Ardoyne area in nearby Catholic West Belfast,
despite Sinn Fein appeals for calm. It roused fears of renewed
rioting in the West Belfast, already tense because of the funerals.
   At the cemetery, mourners screamed as at least five explosions
rang out. McGuinness said that witnesses had spotted four men
getting out of white van and slip into the cemetery just before the
attack.
   Amid scenes of chaos in the cemetery, several hundred youths
gave chase to one attacker who fled, still firing and throwing a
grenades, witnesses said.
   ``I saw maybe 300 youths chasing this one gunman who turned
every 15-20 yards, threw a hand grenade and loosed off a shot
before running again,'' said cab driver Aidan O'Reilly.
   ``The mourners were gaining, but bunched up and he threw another
grenade into the middle of them, then got out on to the motorway.
... He was egging them on to come and get him when he threw the
grenade.''
   At the cemetery, Sinn Fein organizers completed the funeral
while priests comforted the wounded.
   The Rev. Alec Reid, who was saying prayers next to the graveside
as the last of the coffins draped in the Irish tricolor was being
lowered, said he saw a young man throwing something from the back
of the crowd.
   ``I thought they were stones, but it looks as if they were
grenades. He was also firing shots into the crowd.''
   In London, British officials said Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher was immediately informed.
   The mourners had followed the coffins through somber streets to
the cemetery.
   At a mass earlier in St. Agnes, mourners listened silently as
the priest charged that the three IRA men were murdered.
   Shortly before the funeral began, a bomb exploded on a street
more than a mile from the church, slightly injuring a British
soldier on foot patrol, police reported.
   The almost exclusively Catholic Irish Republican Army is
fighting to push the British out of Protestant-dominated Northern
Ireland, join it with the Republic of Ireland and set up an
all-Ireland socialist state.
   Britain says the slain guerrillas were shot by commandos while
preparing a car bomb attack on the changing of the guard outside
the governor's residence in the colony on the southern tip of Spain.
   The three were unarmed, but Britain said they made movements
that led the soldiers to believe their lives were in danger. The
Irish government has complained that the soldiers should have tried
to arrest the trio.
   In the tense buildup to the funerals, Protestants stoned hearses
that brought the IRA bodies home Tuesday.

   Soldiers today battled more than 100
communist rebels who burned a town hall and kidnapped three
policemen. At least four rebels and three soldiers were killed, the
military said.
   Before dawn, about 120 rebels entered San Juan, and most took
over the municipal building while others searched homes, Maj.
Wilmur Panabang told repoters. San Juan is 210 miles north of
Manila.
   Panabang, the Philippine Constabulary assistant provincial
commander, said troops arrived at daybreak in trucks and an armored
personnel carrier from the provincial capital of Bangued, about 20
miles away, and attacked the rebel positions.
   The troops were backed by three helicopter gunships, but
Panabang denied they fired rockets at the rebels in the town hall.
   ``We wanted to do that but we were afraid to miss and hit houses
instead because the town hall is in the middlle of town,'' he said.
   Provincial Governor Vicente Valera ordered the evacuation of
residents from San Juan and nearby villages during the fighting and
military pursuit operations to prevent civilians from getting hit
in the crossfire.
   At least four rebels and three soldiers were killed before the
guerrillas broke off the engagement about five hours later, set
fire to the building and retreated to the nearby mountains,
Panabang said.
   Only seven bodies were recovered following the fighting,
including those of two soldiers whose remains were charred in the
fire. But Panabang quoted witnesses as saying the rebels loaded
nine bodies on a commandeered jeep as they departed.
   He said the rebels ``may very well have suffered up to 13 dead''
in the raid.
   One trooper also was wounded in the fighting, Panabang said.
   The retreating guerrillas took three police hostages with them,
including San Juan police chief Alejandro Arcanghel, he said.
   More than 100 troops backed by the three helicopter gunships and
the armored personnel carrier pursued the rebel force into the
hills around San Juan until midday, Panabang said. He said the
military planned to resume pursuit of the rebels shortly.
   The attack was the bloodiest in northern Luzon this year and was
the second in Abra province.

<TEXT>
   Two crane operators at a plutonium
production plant were contaminated with a low level of radiation,
and one of the men carried the radiation into his home, a plant
spokesman said.
   Investigators found radiation in the cab of a crane at the plant
but the source of the contamination has not been determined, said
Bill Whiting of Westinghouse Hanford, which operates the
Plutonium-Uranium Extraction Plant at the Hanford nuclear
reservation under government contract.
   Contamination was found on one of the men when he reported to
work Monday and a check of his home determined he had spread the
contamination there, Whiting said.
   Radiation was found on the other employee's hands and clothes
Monday as he prepared to leave for the day, Whiting said.
   The level of radiation was extremely low and posed no health
threat, he said.
   Both operators were decontaminated and given clearance to return
to work.
   A radiation team checked the homes of the two crane operators
and two other employees Monday night, Whiting said. They removed a
wash cloth, electric razor, towel and undershirt from the home of
the employee who registered contamination when he arrived at work,
he said.
   The maximum contamination level in the crane operator's home was
3,500 counts per minute, or less than half the radiation present in
the glowing part of a lighted gas lantern, Whiting said.
   ``You can buy higher levels of radiation at the store,'' he said.
   It wasn't known how radiation on the operator who contaminated
his home had been missed in daily checks of employees leaving the
plant.
   The contamination was isolated at the plant in the area
surrounding the crane, he said.
   Investigators' preliminary report will be issued within 10
working days, Whiting said.

   An explosion in a chemistry lab injured a
teacher and a student today and forced officials to close Newton
County High School.
   Both the 34-year-old teacher and the 16-year-old student were
reported in stable condition, but a Georgia Baptist Medical Center
spokeswoman said the teacher was expected to undergo plastic
surgery.
   The teacher was taken by helicopter to the Atlanta hospital with
burns, bruises, hand injuries and minor facial injuries, said
spokeswoman Colleen Nowak.
   The student suffered cuts on her arms and was expected to be
kept overnight at Newton County General Hospital, said a
spokeswoman there, Kathy Klauss.
   The explosion occurred during a chemistry experiment about 8:45
a.m., said Herb Burnsed, assistant superintendent of the Newton
County school system.
   Fumes spread into hallways and prompted officials to dismiss
classes for the day, he said.
   The victims were not identified pending notification of
relatives.

   A small group of people dedicated to Terry
Anderson's release from captivity in Lebanon today hoisted an
American flag and tied a yellow ribbon to the flag pole at City
Hall.
   The ceremony marked the third anniversary of the capture of
Anderson, who was born in Lorain and spent the first seven years of
his life in this northern Ohio city.
   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was abducted March 16, 1985. He is the longest-held of 22
foreign hostages in Lebanon. There has been no word of him for
three months.
   A dozen people, including some of Anderson's relatives, attended
the ceremony in cold, dry weather.
   Jack LaVriha, chairman of the town's Free Terry Anderson
Committee, spoke briefly and accused the Reagan administration of
dragging its feet and doing little on behalf of Anderson and oher
hostages in Lebanon.
   Gwen Jones, Anderson's aunt, said after the ceremony that the
family is ``finding it very hard and frustrating.''
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, will be speaking at the Lorain
Veterans Council's 42nd annual banquet on Saturday. Mrs. Say, of
Batavia, N.Y., was in Washington today for a ceremony for Anderson
and other hostages.
   In Beirut, two Lebanese newspapers today published letters
addressed to Anderson and his pro-Iranian captors, along with
pictures of his 2-year-old daughter.
   Mrs. Jones said she hadn't thought her nephew would be held this
long. She said that if she could talk to him, she would ``tell him
to keep praying. I'm sure the Lord is going to answer those
prayers.''

   Swarms of desert locusts have been sighted

set up to battle the agricultural pests.
   Government sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
authorities have begun spraying in the areas of Bir-Pasteur, north
of Bourje el-Khadra near the frontier.
   A committee comprised of governors from the affected regions,
primarily in eastern and southern Tunisia, is working with the
Tunisian army in fighting the infestation.
   Locusts also have been reported in northern Mauritania, southern
Morocco and Algeria. Morocco has mobilized 35 airplanes and land
vehicles to fight the infestations, according to the official MAP
news agency.
   In late February, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
said northern Africa and the Sahel region were threatened by swarms
of locusts.

   The Taiwan government will allow foreign
films shot on the China mainland to be shown here, an official said
Wednesday.
   Government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming told reporters the government
decided to lift the ban on the films because Taiwan citizens have
been allowed since last year to visit the Chinese mainland for
family reunions.
   Officials of the Government Information Office's Motion Pictures
Department said applications to import the movies will be accepted
effective Wednesday.
   Shaw said, however, that the new policy won't apply to
Mandarin-language films shot in China by companies in the British
colony of Hong Kong, which, together with domestic films, are
governed by a more restrictive law. This restriction will be
reviewed in May.
   Shaw said Taiwan film companies still will be banned from going
to China to shoot movies.
   The public repeatedly has urged the government to ease the
restrictions on foreign films, especially since ``The Last
Emperor,'' a movie shot in Beijing, won nine Oscar nominations last
month.

   Westerly (R.I.) Sun on nuclear reactor safety:
   The cumulative effect of frequent censure of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission for lax enforcement of safety standards is to
bolster a where-there's-smoke-there's-fire conclusion.
   This time ... the NRC's apparent (desire) to OK relicensing of
reactors closed for safety flaws in 1985 by the Tennessee Valley
Authority brought testy comments at a House committee hearing.
   The projected restarts are planned although the Justice
Department has not completed its investigation of charges that the
TVA's nuclear power manager, Steven A. White, made ... false
assertions as to the reactors' compliance with safety rules.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut ... zeroed in on the
conclusion of the commission ... that White ``intentionally lied to
the NRC.''
   He spoke for many ... when he said: ``The thing I am concerned
about is that the Justice Department could decide that Mr. White is
guilty of lying ... and the NRC would have ordered a restart of
that reactor.''
   A fair question: What's the big hurry?

   Baltimore Evening Sun on the execution of Willie Darden:
   As Florida authorities prepared for the ritual of taking Willie
Jasper Darden's life ..., they maintained that his conviction for a
1973 murder was based on ``irrefutable evidence.''
   In fact the evidence is refutable _ refutable by at least two
witnesses who were not called at Darden's trial more than a decade
ago. But what is irrefutable is that Darden, a black man, was tried
before an elected white judge in an inflamed predominantly white
community in rural Florida, prosecuted by a white district
attorney, ... convicted by an all-white jury drawn from friends and
neighbors of the murder victim, and sent to the electric chair by a
white governor. ...
   Is there anyone of any color, creed, ethnic background or
religious or ideological persuasion who truly believes he could get
a fair trial for his life under such circumstances?

   The Kansas City (Mo.) Times on aid to the Contras:
   If Congress has behaved schizophrenically over Contra aid, part
of the reason may be that deception by the administration has made
it hard to tell reality from phantasm in Nicaragua.
   The administration has put lawmakers in the unfortunate position
of having to question the leadership of their democratic government
while simultaneously trying to fend off communist leadership in
another.
   That helps explain why lawmakers have over time voted for and
against Contra aid, and why it is difficult now for military aid to
be approved.

   Riverside (Calif.) Press-Enterprise on budget deficit
projections:
   There is a White House budgeting ritual. Call it Fiscal Chicken.
...
   The White House budget office issues its spending plan. The
spending is all geared to impossibly high economic growth
predictions. In six or eight months, it becomes apparent that there
just isn't that much steam in the economy.
   Shame might compel most people to concede, but this is where
this budget office gets tough. ...
   Only when evidence of this impossible optimism becomes just
mountainous do the president's men back off a bit in their
predictions. And as it retreats, the Office of Management and
Budget is required to observe that there's a new economic boom
coming, just around the corner.
   Recently President Reagan's fiscal 1989 budget was issued. ... A
deficit of $130 billion is foreseen.
   To make all these figures come out so serendipitously, the White
House budget office underlaid them with a forecast of 2.4 percent
economic growth in calendar 1988 and 3.5 percent growth in calendar
1989.
   The Congressional Budget Office has now come out with its own
economic forecast. It envisions growth of 0.6 percent less in '88
and 0.9 percent less in '89. Run the White House budget numbers off
that base and it produces a fiscal 1989 deficit of $165 billion.
   Under the usual rules, the White House wouldn't admit its
optimism before about September. But this being the year of
transitional election, it may never admit it.
   It is Ronald Reagan's last chance to set a new record for rosy
optimism. He'll probably want to have a run at it.

   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on state-federal
relationships:
   State and local governments have long had a love-hate
relationship with Washington. They gladly accept federal subsidies,
but resent conditions on how to spend the money.
   Now they are getting the worst of both worlds: burdensome
mandates without the funds to pay for them.
   The National Governrs' Association has voted to make this issue
its highest priority for 1988.
   The governors _ along with mayors, city councils and school
boards _ believe they deserve far more credit for honesty, good
will and competence than the federal rulemakers are willing to give
them. They are right.
   In many areas, such as education and welfare reform, these
officials have shown themselves to be more innovative and effective
than Washington. ...
   The governors have 163 specific proposals to lighten the
regulatory load. Congress should pay close attention.

   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on drug testing of transportation
employees:
   The discovery of cocaine in the system of the pilot of a
commuter airplane that crashed near Durango, Colo., in January
highlights a troubling dimension of the debate over who, if
anybody, among American workers should be subjected to mandatory
random drug testing.
   It was in January that the National Transportation Safety Board
disclosed a Conrail engineer had used marijuana prior to a January
1987 collision between an Amtrak passenger train and a Conrail
freight train, in which 16 passengers were killed.
   The personal rights of individuals employed in the
transportation industry may have to give way to the right to safety
of those who depend upon them to give alert, drug-free service in
preparing and crewing commercial airliners and trains.
   If there is a group in our society in which mandatory, random
testing would have potential for saving lives, the public
transportation industry is it.

   San Antonio (Texas) Express-News on trading with the Soviet
Union:
   Of all the Cabinet departments, the Department of Commerce is
probably the least conspicuous to the average American, but beware.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity wants to increase trade
with the Soviet Union. Selling Levis, Fords and Coca-Colas to 250
million Soviets is tempting, but caution should be exercised.
   The Soviets won't allow their market to be bought for a
pittance. They want high-tech products more than blue jeans and
cola.
   The Pentagon opposes any trade in sensitive military gear. It
should.
   Getting a corner on Soviet markets is enticing, but these are
the same people who trample the civil rights of their citizens, who
use slave labor to manufacture some of their goods, and who, in
parts of the world, look down rifle barrels at U.S. troops.
   In summary, it's OK to boost trade in some areas, but don't give
away the store.

   The News Tribune, Woodbridge, N.J., on Masters and Johnson's
AIDS research:
   In their new book ... so-called sex experts Drs. William Masters
and Virginia Johnson have suggested that one in 20 men who have had
at least six sexual partners for five years are infected with the
AIDS virus.
   They say the rate is slightly higher among women.
   Previous studies have shown the undeniable link between
intravenous drug use and AIDS, and homosexual behavior and AIDS.
   What Masters and Johnson have done is suggest the link between
casual heterosexual sex and AIDS may be greater than previously
thought.
   Time will tell who is right. We want to believe Masters and
Johnson's scary scenario is wrong. But who knows?
   AIDS is such a mystery that it is difficult to offer reliable
statistics. The debate really isn't how, but how much.
   We could dismiss Masters and Johnson's methodology as wrong.
What would be worse would be to dismiss the risk, and be dead wrong.

   Medford (Ore.) Mail Tribune on Jesse Jackson:
   Jesse Jackson says he plans to be the Democratic Party's
presidential nominee. ... With all due respect, we beg to differ.
...
   Jackson cannot survive a close examination. His record includes
too many radical stands, too many blanket condemnations of the
United States and too many associations with foreign leaders of
questionable character. ...
   In practical terms, Jackson's best hope is that his delegate
strength will force the party's leaders to make sure that the
presidential platform features issues of concern to the people who
have supported him.
   Expecting much of anything beyond that is wishful thinking.

   Brainerd (Minn.) Daily Dispatch on postal rate increases:
   Dear Postmaster General:
   We're writing to you now, before postage rates rise next month.
   So you want to raise the price of the common, first-class stamp
to 25 cents? That's only a jump of 14 percent, or three cents.
   Trouble is, that's just part of the problem.
   You also want to raise the rates for second-class mail by 18
percent and for third-class mail by 25 percent.
   And guess who is going to help offset the increase. Yep, the
consumer.
   Affected businesses will be forced to charge higher prices.
Magazines and newspapers will be forced to charge higher rates for
advertising and subscriptions.
   We're afraid that higher postage rates will impose hardships on
postal patrons whose only consolation will be a probable decline in
the amount of junk mail.

   The Hutchinson (Kan.) News on college admissions standards:
   Mediocrity may be just so-so in most places, but in the Kansas
House of Representatives, medocrity is excellent.
   With a vote so lopsided that it could never be described as
average, the House spurned the idea of setting some (rather low)
admissions standards for entrance to the state's top universities.
...
   Kansas students would have responded well to the modest
challenge outlined in the educational admissions bill.
   No conscientious student would have been prevented from getting
a college degree, and a series of higher educational standards
would have led to more valuable degrees. ...
   Mediocrity is not nearly the superlative value that politicians
think it to be.

   The Milwaukee (Wis.) Journal on anti-drug legislation:
   Barely two weeks before the current state legislative session is
to end, the omnibus drug bill promoted by Gov. Thompson and several
lawmakers appears ready for action.
   The massive bill, which sets out an $11.6 million drug-fighting
program, is the state's broadest attack on drug abuse in years and
deserves bipartisan support.
   Apparently, the only danger the bill faces is the possibility of
getting hung up over one of its more controversial features _ the
so-called ``Len Bias'' provision.
   Named for a University of Maryland basketball player who died in
1986 after taking cocaine, this provision would allow prosecution
of drug suppliers on charges of second-degree murder if a client
died of drug use.
   While that provision likely would have a deterrent effect on
drug dealers and should be retained in the bill's final version, it
is by no means the heart of the legislation.
   Debate over its inclusion should not be permitted to hold up
legislative approval of the omnibus bill.
   More important are the bill's (1) stiffer criminal penalties for
the sale and use of a broad class of drugs and (2) needed funds for
drug and alcohol treatment programs. ...
   The bill strongly deserves approval before the Legislature
adjourns.

<HEAD>Woman Pleads Guilty To Locking Boy In Box, Faces Maximum 90-Day
Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman charged with keeping an 8-year-old
boy in a coffin-like box for two years said she confined the boy to
protect her possessions and pleaded guilty to unlawful imprisonment.
   ``I restrained (the boy) during my sleeping hours in order to
keep him from destroying property. My judgment may not have been
proper, but my judgment as to the amount of restraint seemed proper
to me under the circumstances,'' said Retha Skyles in a handwritten
statement.
   Ms. Skyles, 54, entered her plea Tuesday in Pierce County
Superior Court before Judge Thomas Swayze Jr., who set sentencing
for April 26.
   In exchange for the plea, the prosecution agreed that Ms. Skyles
be sentenced under provisions for first-time offenders, said deputy
prosecutor Barbara Corey-Boulet.
   That means a judge could sentence the woman to up to 90 days in
jail plus two years' probation and counseling.
   Ms. Skyles was charged with keeping the son of her
step-granddaughter in a playhouse-sized box from May 1, 1985, to
May 1, 1987. The box often was locked and contained a jar in which
the boy was expected to urinate, the charges said. The boy was not
allowed to attend school.
   An anonymous referral tipped off state Child Potective Services
workers on April 29, 1987, and they took the boy and his
11-year-old sister into custody. The siblings have lived with
foster parents and are doing well, Ms. Corey-Boulet said.
   One of Ms. Skyles' adult sons said the confinement was a
temporary way to handle the tantrum-prone boy.
   He said the family believed he was brain-damaged because of his
mother, who the son said abused drugs and wouldn't take proper care
of the boy. The natural mother denied she was a drug abuser.

<HEAD>Spanish Teachers Continue Strikes For More Pay</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Most of Spain's 270,000 public school
teachers on Wednesday began a second two-day strike for higher pay,
forcing cancellation of classes for more than 5 million students,
union and Education Ministry officials said.
   The ministry said it won't negotiate while the threat of strikes
continues.
   The nation's two largest unions, the Socialist-led General
Workers Union and the communist-oriented Workers Commissions,
called the strike.
   The unions said 92 percent of teachers backed their March 9-10
strike. The Education Ministry estimated teacher participation at
60 percent.
   Negotiations broke off last month over public elementary and
secondary school teachers' demands that they receive pay equal to
that of similarly qualified civil servants.
   A union spokesman said primary school teachers earn an average
of about $929 a month and want it raised to about $1,170, while
secondary and technical school teachers want about $1,380 a month.
   Education Ministry Undersecretary Joaquin Arango said teachers
last year received the biggest raises _ 13 percent _ among civil
servants. The rest of the civil servants received raises of 5
percent. Spain's 1987 inflation rate was 4.6 percent.

   A seed company has developed a poppy
with a reduced content of opium, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   The white poppy is popular in Denmark for its seed,
traditionally used in bread. The plant's juice contains opium,
which can be refined into morphine and heroin.
   ``We are doing this so that drug addicts will not feel tempted
to pick or cut the poppies to get the drug, and so that farmers
will continue to be allowed to grow poppies,'' said Christian
Petersen of Daehnfeldt, the biggest seed producer in Europe.
   Drug addicts have been known to plunder poppy fields in Denmark.
In other countries, including the United States, Great Britain and
West Germany, poppy cultivation has been banned.
   ``We ... have been able to reduce the opium content by half. In
a couple of years, we expect to have more or less eliminated it
completely,'' Petersen said.

<HEAD>Test Critic Files Fraud Complaints in 50 States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West Virginia physician has filed consumer
fraud complaints in all 50 states charging four major publishers
with selling achievement tests that give a misleadingly rosy
picture of student progress.
   The complaints were filed by John Jacob Cannell, who gained
prominence last November as a test gadfly with a 26-page report
accusing publishers of the Iowa Test, the Metropolitan Achievement
Test and similar tests of giving ``children, parents, school
systems, legislatures, and the press misleading reports on
achievement levels.''
   The November report led officials of the U.S. Department of
Education to summon 40 test experts and publishers to a closed-door
meeting last month to discuss possible actions.
   Cannell, who is from Daniels, W.Va., filed his complaints
Wednesday with the 50 state attorneys general, and distributed them
to reporters. But he said he had not provided copies to the
publishers named in the complaints.
   Three of the four publishers said they had no comment because
they hadn't seen the complaint. But a spokesman for CTB@McGraw
Hill, publisher of the California Achievement Test and
Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, said Cannell's work was ``full
of fallacious statements.''
   Cannell's complaint claimed ``that 90 percent of school
districts and 70 percent of children in America's public elementary
schools are presently testing above average in elementary grades on
one of the six commercial tests used in the U.S.A.''
   Thirty-eight of the complaints named CTB@McGraw Hill; 36 named
The Psychological Corporation, which publishes the Stanford
Achievement Test and the Metropolitan Achievement Test; 31 cited
Riverside Publishing Co., which publishes the Iowa Test of Basic
Skills, and 26 listed Science Research Associates, publisher of the
SRA exam.
   The complaints ask that publishers be required to identify
school districts using their tests, provide free annual updates of
the norms that determine how students score, and provide new test
questions for free each year to ensure that schools cannot ``teach
to the test.''
   Cannell, founder and head of the 700-member West Virginia
education watchdog group Friends for Education Inc., also called
upon each state to analyze standardized tests to determine if they
have gotten easier over time.
   He also demanded that test publishers supply new, more accurate
tests at no charge to ``compensate consumers for any
misrepresentations received from previously deceptive tests.''
   In September, Cannell filed similar consumer complaints in his
home state and in Kentucky. He withdrew them last month after
McGraw Hill announced it would provide annually updated norms.
   Paul Williams, director of research and management of CTB@McGraw
Hill, said Cannell condemned standardized tests generally for
giving too rosy a picture of student progress, but ``he only looks
at half the pie'' because Cannell omits the fact that test scores
for high school students have declined.
   Responding to some of Cannell's specific complaints, Williams
said publishers would probably resist demands to identify school
districts using their tests. ``We have a responsibility to protect
the confidentiality of our customers,'' he said.
   Williams said his company already updates test norms annually,
but he rejected Cannell's demand that that service be provided free.
   He said it would be possible for testmakers to provide states
with new questions each year, ``but it's also expensive. If our
customers want it, we would respond.''
   He added that the technical manuals that publishers routinely
provide school districts using their tests already provide much of
the information Cannell demanded, such as how difficult the tests
are.

<HEAD>Future of Kremlin Policy Abroad Also at Stake in Geneva Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hopes for an end to the war in Afghanistan have
focused attention on talks in Geneva this week, but more is at
stake than the Soviet Union's military withdrawal from the
9-year-old conflict.
   The Kremlin's apparent willingness to extract its estimated
115,000 troops may signal a broader policy change in the
superpower's role in foreign revolutions.
   Should an acceptable retreat be found from Afghanistan and the
conflict between pro- and anti-Communist forces be left to the
Afghans, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev would heal one of his
nation's most visible foreign policy sores. He also could improve
relations with the United States, China, the Indian subcontinent
and the Moslem world.
   Perhaps most importantly, some observers suggest, the Kremlin
might be rethinking its role in promoting socialist revolution in
nations such as Nicaragua and Angola, where Soviet aid bolsters
government forces against tenacious opposition.
   The Afghan revolution is the only struggle in which the Soviet
Union acknowledges its troops are fighting.
   Since the Kremlin announced last year that it had taken the
``political decision'' to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, the
state-run media and officials have hinted that policies that led to
the Dec. 27, 1979, intervention are under close scrutiny.
   Oleg T. Bogomolov, a leading economist who heads the Institute
of Economics of the World Socialist System, said in a letter
published Wednesday that he warned the Kremlin less than a month
after the intervention that sending Soviet soldiers to Afghanistan
damaged relations with the United States, China and Moslem nations.
   While Marxist doctrine forecasts the spread of socialist
revolution worldwide, Gorbachev has made it clear that his first
priority is getting his own nation's economy on its feet.
   The government has indicated it will fulfill its contractual
agreements, even in Afghanistan.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters
Tuesday that military aid to Afghanistan was not subject to
negotiation in Geneva because it was part of longstanding
cooperation with Kabul.
   However, some American Sovietologists and veteran foreign policy
experts see in the military withdrawal the possible emergence of a
policy of improving relations with other nations and directing
resources to domestic needs.
   ``I see them moving toward a different approach to regional
conflict,'' former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara said in
an interview. ``I get the distinct impression they are changing
substantially their view of the projection of power, in part on the
basis of their experience in Afghanistan, as in the United States
we were affected by our experience in Vietnam.''
   McNamara, in Moscow this week for a conference on Soviet
reforms, served as defense secretary in the 1960s during the height
of the Vietnam War under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B.
Johnson.
   If Gorbachev's stated sentiment for focusing time and money on
improving the Soviet lifestyle is genuine, McNamara suggested, he
will find it expedient to reduce Soviet involvement in struggles
between pro- and anti-Communist forces.
   He pointed to civil warfare in Nicaragua and Angola as examples
where Gorbachev may be willing to step out if the United States did.
   Robert Legvold, director of Columbia University's Harriman
Institute for Advanced Study of the Soviet Union, accompanied a
U.S. Senate delegation to a three-hour meeting with Gorbachev last
week.
   He said he is convinced Gorbachev and his advisers have made a
commitment to ``cut their losses'' in Afghanistan and have already
begun a serious analysis of how the mistake of intervening was made.
   ``There is a feeling it was a lousy decision in all contexts _
in U.S.-Soviet relations, in relations with Arab countries, in
Sino-Soviet relations,'' Legvold said.
   The key move in working toward an Afghan peace accord was an end
to Soviet insistence that the postwar government retain its current
socialist character, said Legvold.
   Stephen Cohen, a Princeton University professor and author of
several books on the Soviet Union, said the war in Afghanistan
could teach the Kremlin ``the constraints of power'' and that
losing a conventional war in the nuclear age does not necessarily
threaten their security.

<HEAD>Harris Poll Finds Lost Leisure Hurts Arts Attendance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAYNER PIKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents say they would be willing to pay higher
taxes to give their children more education in the arts, according
to pollster Louis Harris.
   Seventy percent of respondents said they would pay an extra $10
in taxes for that purpose, and 56 percent would pay an extra $25,
Harris said.
   ``The American people are nothing less than outraged at the cuts
that have been made in the arts in the curricula of public
schools,'' Harris said Tuesday.
   He said nine of 10 people polled said, ``it's highly important
for children of school age to be exposed to theater, music and
dance, exhibitions of paintings and sculpture and similar cultural
events.''
   Fifty-eight of those polled believe their children are being
deprived of that experience, Harris said.
   ``Two of three give the arts as important billing as math,
science, English, languages and social studies,'' Harris said.
``This is a powerful mandate _ one that's gone too long unheeded by
the school establishment in this country.''
   However, despite support for arts in the schools, people are
going to performances less.
   Harris said decreases of 12 percent in attendance and 3 percent
in participation were the first declines sustained since 1973, when
he began regularly sampling national attitudes about the arts.
   Although 33 percent of those polled said lack of time was the
reason they didn't go to more arts performances, 32 percent said
not enough performances were offered where they live and 29 percent
said ticket prices are too high.
   ``No doubt price is an important element,'' Harris said, but he
called time more important.
   Until the current poll, the amount of time devoted to the arts
had grown _ despite a decline in leisure time from a median of 26.2
hours a week in 1973 to 18.1 hours in 1984.
   In the poll, a telephone survey of 1,501 adults conducted for
Philip Morris Companies Inc. in March and April 1987, leisure time
slipped to 16.6 hours a week overall, with women, blacks and
Hispanics below the median. The survey group, Harris said,
represented a national cross-section.
   The survey showed that Hispanics have 13 hours a week of leisure
time, and blacks, although gaining nearly three hours a week since
1984, still have only 15.
   Women, increasingly combining jobs and homemaking, report having
14 hours a week for leisure time, while men have 19 hours, Harris
said.
   ``When people have lost leisure time, they have turned to
VCRs,'' said Harris. He said that ``44 percent of owners of VCRs
report that they are increasingly watching a movie or some other
performance on videotape instead of watching regularly scheduled
programs on television.''
   ``People want to be able to pick and choose precisely what
they'll be doing with their precious but limited leisure time,'' he
said. ``If they have an hour and 10 minutes _ and people are
measuring it that way _ they're highly likely to pick out a
videocassette that appeals to them and make a date with themselves
to enjoy it.''

   The Air Force Academy grounds
will be opened to limited deer hunting this fall for the first time
in 18 years because of a burgeoning deer population and dwindling
forage.
   Without the hunting season, some of the estimated 1,500 to 2,000
deer could starve to death.
   The Oct. 15-Nov. 13 season for antlerless deer will be limited
to 80 hunters _ 40 from the public and 40 academy personnel, said
Tom Seamans, regional state wildlife manager.
   Only rifles may be used.
   Many of the deer who roam the academy appear to have little fear
of people, but while they have been shielded from hunters for
nearly two decades, their lives have not been risk-free.
   Mike Babler, academy resources officer, said about 100 deer are
killed by motorists each year on academy reservation roads and
adjoining Interstate 25. In 1986, there were 186 collisions between
cars and deer on or near the academy, he said.

   A man convicted of buying LSD with
$20,000 he received from a state fund for crime victims has been
sentenced to four years in prison and fined $14,000, federal court
officials said Wednesday.
   James B. Miller, 29, of South Charleston, pleaded guilty in
January to two counts of distributing the hallucinogenic drug,
admitting he sold 3,300 ``hits'' of LSD to police agents in 1986.
   He appeared Tuesday before U.S. District Judge John T.
Copenhaver Jr.
   Compensation fund records show Miller was awarded the maximum
personal-injury payment of $20,000 in 1985 after he was shot in
1983. Miller apparently had just arrived at a beach party when he
was shot in the right arm by someone using a .30-caliber rifle,
police records show.
   Miller lost his arm and incurred about $38,000 in medical bills,
according to state officials.
   State officials said the crime victims' fund now can pay claims
directly to hospitals.

<HEAD>Paris Art Gallery Sues Beverly Hills Art Dealer For Alleged Dali
Fakes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Paris art gallery filed federal lawsuits
accusing a dealer of operating a $32.5 million nationwide forgery
network specializing in the works of surrealist painter Salvador
Dali.
   T.R. Rogers, whose Beverly Hills gallery was raided in August
when forgery allegations surfaced, was named with four others in
the $145 million package of suits filed last week in Los Angeles
and New York on behalf of Galerie Furstenberg of Paris.
   Also named were wholesalers Philip Coffaro, Thomas Wallace and
Carol Convertine and art authenticator Julien Aime, all of New York.
   The New York suit accuses all five of running an ongoing
criminal enterprise in violation of federal racketeering laws.
   Rogers' attorney, David Steiner, called the lawsuits
``preposterous,'' and Arnold Ross, a New York lawyer representing
Coffaro, said, ``There doesn't appear to be any basis to it at
all.''
   ``I'm sure there will be substantial cross-complaints filed
against them for the outrageous claims they're making,'' Steiner
said.
   Beverly Hills detectives began an investigation into Rogers'
gallery last summer after Jean Argillet, owner of Galerie
Furstenberg, told police the originals of some of the works in
Rogers' gallery represented as Dalis were actually in his own
gallery in France.
   The case has since been turned over to the major frauds section
of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.
   The international Dali market has long been the subject of an
authenticity controversy because the artist made numerous copies
during his youth and now refuses to come out of seclusion in Spain
to authenticate disputed canvasses.
   Ms. Convertine pleaded guilty to felony fraud and grand larceny
charges in New York last year.
   A grand jury is now contemplating criminal charges against a
Honolulu gallery. Another criminal case was begun in New Mexico,
and the Federal Trade Commission is taking civil action against a
gallery in Arizona.
   According to the Galerie Furstenberg lawsuits, the defendants
reproduced photos of Dali originals, and through photomechanical
means engraved the images on copper plates and ran off multiple
copies.

   So, officers stopped the truck driver Tuesday night but found

   Multiple births increased slightly in the United
States from 1984 to 1985, according to insurance company figures
issued Wednesday.
   Multiple births were up 6 percent during the period _ although
they still accounted for only 2.1 percent of the 3.7 million
recorded live births, according to the Statistical Bulletin, a
quarterly publication produced by the Metropolitan Life Insurance
Co.
   Most of the multiple births were twins. However, fertility drugs
have slightly increased the odds for triplets, the report said. In
1985, 2.5 percent of multiple births involved three or more babies
_ up from 2.1 percent in 1983.

<TEXT>
   When the Allegan County Sheriff's
Department submitted a $930 bill for 5,000 pencils bearing the
sheriff's name, county officials drew the line.
   Sheriff's department officials said the pencils were to be
distributed to students to promote the department's new Youth
Services Bureau, and that's why the bill was submitted to the
county finance committee as a school safety expense.
   ``It's a good thing it doesn't say re-elect (Sheriff) Robert
Schra ... but it came through to us as saying political pencils,''
County Commissioner Flora Moore, co-chair of the finance committee,
said Tuesday. ``Nine hundred dollars worth of advertising pencils
is quite a lot for us to put our John Henry on.''
   Schra said his name appears on most items distributed by the
department, and he is confident the bill will be approved once an
explanation is provided to the committee.
   Moore said she might reconsider the funding if the message is
changed.
   ```Observe the safety rules always' would be fine,'' she said.

   Billionaire businessman H. Ross Perot says he just
wants to make Dallas a better place to live.
   That, he says, is why he has tried to help a police effort to
abolish a civilian review board and get the city to hire more
officers.
   ``I'm about to decide that the perception around here is that if
you're not an elected official, I ought to just sit out in the
office and make money,'' Perot told Dallas Times Herald editors
Tuesday. ``Fine. Create jobs, make money, that's your slot in life,
Perot. Fine.''
   The newspaper editors invited Perot to lunch after he complained
that the media had failed to communicate adequately his motives for
championing the police efforts.
   ``I see these people working together without regard to races
and sex. By God, they're an example for the rest of us,'' he said.
   Opponents say the review panel, which has limited subpoena
powers, is unnecessary. They contend police already are subject to
grand jury scrutiny and internal affairs investigations. Perot has
joined opponents in efforts to repeal the measure through a charter
amendment election.
   City Council approved the review board following controversy
over accusations police are trigger-happy with minority suspects
and a congressional hearing.
   ``It bothers me a lot to have spent 20 years of my life and tens
of millions of dollars trying to help the minorities in this state
and get the kind of reaction I'm getting right now,'' Perot said.
``I never expect anybody to thank me, and nobody ever did. But I
sure ... didn't expect to get my teeth kicked in (and be called) a
racist.''

   Judge Joseph Wapner works to protect
justice on the ``People's Court,'' but he also inadvertently saved
two women from injury.
   Trossa Fowler, 73, and another woman, who was not identified,
were taking their teacups to the kitchen in Mrs. Fowler's home
Monday when they stopped to hear the judge.
   ``We weren't really watching it,'' Mrs. Fowler said. ``But when
we passed by, Judge Wapner said something interesting.''
   Good timing. It was then that a truck crashed into the kitchen,
Mrs. Fowler said.
   Mrs. Fowler said her stove was bent, and the damages totaled
$6,000.
   The 64-year-old driver suffered minor injuries and was arrested
on a charge of driving while intoxicated.

   Painter Ralph Fasanella wandered among
the cavernous red-brick buildings more than a half-century after
violence erupted between angry immigrant mill workers and police.
   He saw ghosts of the 1912 Bread and Roses strike everywhere.
   ``I didn't have to witness the strike to know the images,'' said
Fasanella.
   Fasanella and his painting soon will return to Lawrence, where
workers battled mill owners and the National Guard in a clash
considered pivotal in the early labor struggle.
   ``The painting is going home,'' Fasanella, 73, said Tuesday from
his Ardsley, N.Y., home, where the painting is now.
   The May 1 dedication of Fasanella's ``Lawrence 1912: The Bread
and Roses Strike,'' will culminate months of planning and
fund-raising, said City Hall spokesman James Ball.
   Half the $100,000 price of the painting was donated by the
state; private donations and more than $10,000 from unions around
the nation were raised, said Ball.

   Yasuhiro Nakasone, former prime
minister of Japan, took a break in a speaking tour to share lunch
with an old friend, a man who befriended his daughter 27 years ago.
   Almost without trying, Mort and Agatha Winski made Nakasone and
his wife, Tsutako, comfortable Tuesday. Japanese labels are on
appliances around their home. A small Japanese koi pond caught
Nakasone's eye.
   ``Omoshiroi'' _ interesting _ Nakasone said.
   The couples ate at a nearby resort hotel, which recently was
purchased by a Japanese corporation.
   Winski, 72, formerly of Michigan City, Ind., met 11-year-old
Mieko Nakasone through a summer exchange program for students in
1961. Four years later, the Winskis volunteered to be hosts to
Mieko for a year while she attended a U.S. high school.
   The Nakasones returned the favor, taking in the Winskis' eldest
daughter, Susan.
   ``We just kept exchanging daughters,'' Nakasone, 69, said. ``And
I hope it continues.''

   Prince Charles is ``bearing up well''
after watching his friend and skiing companion, Maj. Hugh Lindsay,
die in a Swiss avalanche, his wife, Princess Diana, said Wednesday.
   Charles, 39-year-old heir to the British throne, escaped injury
at the Klosters ski resort a week ago.
   Lindsay, a 34-year-old career army officer and former aide to
Queen Elizabeth II, was probably killed by a block of ice before
being buried in the snow, an inquest heard Tuesday.
   Diana's first public appearance since the tragedy was at the
Holywell Leisure Center in North Wales where where a member of the
waiting crowd asked how Charles was coping.
   ``He is bearing up well, thank you,'' she said.
   Diana and her pregnant sister-in-law, the Duchess of York, were
in their chalet when the accident occurred. Another member of the
ski party, Patti Palmer-Tomkinson, suffered two broken legs and a
lung injury.

   An engine fire broke out today on the Scandinavian
Star, leaving the cruise ship adrift for hours in the Gulf of
Mexico with more than 700 people on board, authorities said.
   ``The fire is out and the ship is being towed by the Mexican
navy to Cancun,'' said Chief Petty Officer Luis Diaz of the U.S.
Coast Guard in Miami. The Navy cutter Vigilance was escorting the
ship as a precaution, he said.
   No fire injuries were reported, but an unidentified 71-year-old
male passenger suffered a heart attack. A helicopter was dispatched
from Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami to the man up.
   The Scandinavian Star was about 35 miles off Isla Mujeres, a
Mexican island north of the tourist resort Cancun in the Yucatan
peninsula, the Coast Guard said.
   Coast Guard spokesmen said that even though the fire was under
control, the engine room had been sealed off and carbon dioxide had
been pumped in, and the ship was dead in the water.
   The cruise ship Canada Star and another vessel, the Vera Cruz I,
were standing by to assist.
   The Canada Star's captain, Jens Thorn, said that the fire
appeared to have been brought under control, and there was no
reason to evacuate the ship.
   ``In the event that the fire breaks out again, and that
passengers have to evacuate the vessel, we will be there to assist
and take the passengers,'' Thorn said.
   ``Our report is that it's under control, they have engine
compartment sealed and they've pumped CO2 in there to smother the
flames,'' said Petty Officer Dan Vogeley said.
   Petty Officer Brian Lincoln said the ship's captain had
requested additional fire-fighting equipment, such as foam and CO2.
   Among the 449 passengers and 266 crew members were a group of 16
high school seniors from Trenton, Texas, who were accompanied by
other family members.
   The seniors had raised money for their trip with chili suppers
and car washes. The Coast Guard said nobody in the party was
injured, according to schools superintendent Eddie Derr.
   The ship should arrive in Cancun late Wednesday or Thursday,
said Diaz.
   Jill DeChello, a spokeswoman for Miami-based SeaEscape Ltd., the
ship's owner, said the passengers would then be flown to St.
Petersburg.
   The ship was returning to St. Petersburg after a three-day,
four-night cruise to Cozumel when the fire broke out, she said.
   Dye and Ms. DeChello said officials weren't sure what sparked
the fire, which began shortly after 1 a.m.
   ``It will take a week before we know the cause and the extent of
the damage,'' said Ms. DeChello.
   A sister ship to the Star, the Scandanavian Sun, caught fire in
the port of Miami in August 1984, leaving a woman passenger and a
crew member dead.
   Ms. DeChello said there was no connection between the two
incidents.

   The Reagan administration has notified
Congress it plans to sell jet fighter planes to Israel, Pakistan
and Bahrain and to equip Egypt's six Soviet-built submarines with
U.S. torpedoes and radar.
   Egypt also would purchase an unspecified number of M-60 tanks,
while Pakistan would buy P-3 Orion aircraft to hunt submarines, as
well as either AWACS or Hawkeye radar planes.
   The classified report covering projected arms sales for 1988 was
sent Feb. 25 to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the
House Foreign Affairs Committee. It was made available Wednesday to
The Associated Press.
   Some items may be deleted and others added. After Congress is
notified officially of a projected sale it has 30 days to block it
by majority votes of both the House and Senate.
   The 75 F-16 jet fighters ticketed for Israel are intended to
compensate for the Lavi, the warplane Israel was building with U.S.
financial support. Under U.S. pressure, the project was canceled
last August after $1.3 billion had been spent on it.
   Pakistan, another close U.S. ally, would purchase an unspecified
number of F-16s, and Bahrain, a small oil state in the Persian
Gulf, would obtain four of the jet fighters, plus helicopters.
   Saudi Arabia is due to get equipment for its U.S.-built AWACS
radar planes and also $500 million worth of Bradley armored
personnel carriers. About 400 Bradleys could be purchased with $500
million.
   Egypt, which has the largest fleet of submarines in the Arab
world, will be able to modernize the six supplied by the Soviet
Union. Two others were sold to Egypt by China.
   The Reagan administration also informed the congressional
committees it would build a $2 billion factory in Egypt to provide
M-1 tanks for the Egyptian armed forces and separately sell Egypt
$60 million worth of M-60 tanks and Hawkeye radar planes.
   Stingers, the shoulder-fired missile that Afghan guerrillas have
used effectively against Soviet airplanes and helicopters, would be
sold to several countries, including Austria, Denmark, France,
Greece, Japan, South Korea and Pakistan.
   No U.S. weapons sales are planned for Jordan, which the
administration is trying to persuade to negotiate peace terms with
Israel. Congress has banned new arms for the Arab kingdom until it
agrees to work out a Middle East settlement.

   U.S. Customs agents seized the passport of a man
they accused of smuggling 10 to 12 pounds of cocaine just hours
after a new get-tough policy went into effect, agency spokesmen
said.
   ``A lot of people come in with contraband and go right back out
of the country without going to court. It's become a joke,'' Vann
Capps, director of operations for the Customs Service at Miami
International Airport, said of the passport seizure policy.
   ``This is another tool we can use that is vital to our defense
against drugs,'' he said.
   The new rule will apply to anyone attempting to bring illegal
drugs into the country, regardless of how small the amount, Capps
said. Customs officers routinely make six to 10 drug seizures daily
at the Miami airport; the new program could result in the
confiscation of hundreds of passports weekly, he said.
   Some legal experts have criticized the new policy. They question
the constitutionality of restricting a person's freedom to travel
before the person has been convicted of a crime.
   On Tuesday morning, Dwight Aristotle Borelli, 21, of Miami,
brought home two suitcases with false sides on a flight that
originated in La Paz, Bolivia, and stopped in Panama City, Panama,
said Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan.
   ``Within the false sides of the suitcases, inspectors found
approximately 10 to 12 pounds of cocaine,'' Sheehan said.
   Borelli's U.S. passport was seized and he was arrested about 5
a.m., five hours after the policy took effect, Sheehan said.
Borelli, charged with unlawful importation of cocaine and
possession of a controlled substance, was turned over to the vice
president's drug task force, which prosecutes federal cases.
   Customs inspectors turned Borelli's passport over to federal
prosecutors, who can use it as evidence, Sheehan said. Once the
case is resolved, Borelli will have to apply to the State
Department to get the passport back.

   Citibank said it will abandon a policy
that denied credit cards to some liberal arts majors after students
at the University of California-Berkeley demanded the bank's
representatives be barred from campus.
   Bill McGuire, a spokesman for Citibank in New York, said on
Wednesday the bank was retreating from the policy and that it would
be discontinued by the end of June. He admitted the company had
received complaints from several universities around the country,
but he would not name them.
   Although McGuire said in a telephone interview ``using the major
was a good indicator of future earning potential and of students'
ability to pay debt,'' he would not describe how the policy was
applied.
   McGuire said other factors would be used to judge students'
credit worthiness, but he would not specify what they are.
   A spokesman for the United States Comptroller of the Currency in
Kansas City, Mo., said Tuesday that the Equal Credit Opportunity
Act does not prohibit using a student's academic major in a credit
application system.
   Spokeswoman for American Express and the Bank of America said
they were surprised by the Citibank policy, since their
organizations had found that students were good credit risks.
   American Express and Bank of America, along with Citibank the
largest credit card issuers, said they do not use academic majors
as part of their credit scoring system for students.
   The UC students complained they were denied credit cards because
of their studies in such areas as English, rhetoric, art history
and Italian. They said the bank's representatives would be barred
from campus unless there was a change in the policy.
   ``This was obvious, senseless discrimination, that in effect
said students in business or engineering majors are the ones who
will be making all the money and that only they could be trusted,''
said Molly Sorkin, 22.
   Sorkin, a major in art history major last fall at UC-Berkeley,
said Citibank rejected her application for a Visa card last fall
because of her ``field of study.''
   ``What I study says nothing about my responsibility or whether
or not I can pay my bills,'' said Sorkin, who graduated in December
and now works in retail sales.
   ``It seems like they're trying to promote engineering and
business majors. We cannot condone such discrimination in our
society,'' said Kennedy Yip, turned down by Citibank on Feb. 13
because of his rhetoric major.
   Yip, 22, received a Visa last year while attending a different
college as a mathematics major.
   The Citibank policy, apparently part of a credit scoring system,
was uncovered last week when a reporter for the independent campus
newspaper, The Daily Californian, asked a campus bank-card
canvasser how to apply. Citibank representatives set up tables
around the student union to accept credit applications.
   The canvasser, reporter Irene Chang said, advised her to fill in
the credit application by listing business administration or
electrical engineering as her major, instead of English.
   Michele Lee, a senator in UC-Berkeley's student government, said
she was investigating complaints against Citibank as well as
against a local department store that reportedly also has denied
credit to students because of their majors. She didn't identify the
store chain.

<TEXT>
   Two newspapers have published accounts of
homelessness in the capital, saying vagrants are living in
underground passages, garbage dumps and staircases.
   The reports, in the national Democratic Party daily Kurier
Polski and in the Warsaw evening daily Express Wieczorny, offered
an unusually vivid discussion of the topic of homelessness, which
officially does not exist in Poland's communist system.
   The articles, published Monday, also reflect the current
liveliness of the official press in Poland, in which censorship of
news on domestic topics has been markedly relaxed.
   ``Statistics don't say how many homeless people there are in
Poland. But from unofficial sources we know there are about 15,000
of them in Warsaw alone,'' said Express Wieczorny. Warsaw's
population is 1.5 million.
   The Kurier Polski article talked about a colony of 20-50
homeless people recently discovered living in underground passages
for the city's central water heating system.
   ``Until not long ago nobody knew that the dark, unending
corridors ... were pulsating with life. Along with all kinds of
worms, the capital's tramps are living there,'' the paper said.
   Asked about the reports at his weekly news conference Tuesday,
government spokesman Jerzy Urban said he had not seen the articles,
but, ``I stand by my statement that there is no such social problem
as homelessness in Poland.''
   Although there is a severe housing shortage in Poland, there is
no evident homelessness in the streets. Beggars are rarely seen and
vagrancy is a crime.
   According to the articles, the homeless include alcoholics,
ex-convicts, mentally ill people and people who are estranged from
their relatives.
   ``Most of them resigned from normal family life by their own
will. One day they simply left their homes and went away,'' said
the Kurier Polski article.
   ``They live in railway stations, in staircases, in garbage dumps
and even in (underground) canals,'' said the Express Wieczorny
article. ``They are dirty, often have head louses and are exhausted
because of malnutrition.'' It said their number is growing.
   The paper said a church social organization, the Adam
Chmielowski Aid Society, is active in Warsaw and five other cities
helping to arrange shelter and jobs for the homeless. The society
gets support from the Roman Catholic Church and the Ministry of
Health and Social Care, it said.
   Kurier Polski, the official paper of the Polish Democratic
Party, which is allied with the ruling Polish United Workers
(Communist) Party, said the homeless people redeem bottles or
rummage through trash and sell salvageable clothing at the city's
markets.
   ``Every earned zloty goes for the purchase of vodka,'' it said.
   It said the colony living in the underground corridors near the
Zeran heat and power plant was discovered two weeks ago when one of
the inhabitants died from alcohol poisoning.
   After a few days, some of the vagrants reported the death to
nuns, who summoned police, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   The superpowers use Sweden as a center
for espionage, and the KGB has nearly 100 agents here, while the
CIA has 10 or 11, according to a book published this week.
   ``Sweden's proximity to Poland and the (Soviet) Baltic states
makes Stockholm a natural junction for the CIA's network of agents
on the other side of the Baltic Sea,'' said the book, ``Espionage
in Sweden,''
   It also said that three out of five Soviet diplomats in
Stockholm are spies, ``a proportion usually reserved for Soviet
embassies in cities like Washington, Mexico City and Brussels.''
   The book, sponsored by the current affairs magazine Tempus,
brought up to date a series of articles that ran in the respected
magazine in 1984. It often quoted local and foreign newspapers and
books in addition to its own sources.
   A spokesman for Sweden's security police said only the director
was authorized to comment on the book and that he was unavailable.
Defense Ministry spokesman Thomas Guer said the book, which was
mailed to news agencies, had not reached the ministry and he also
could not comment.
   ``The KGB personnel working in Denmark and Norway ... regularly
meet their superiors in Stockholm ... Highly placed intelligence
officers from both Moscow and East Berlin are often seen in
Stockholm,'' the book said.
   When Boris Pankin, known as a Soviet literary critic and editor,
was proposed as ambassador in 1982, the Swedish security police
cleared him as a ``harmless intellectual.'' The Swedes later
learned he was a KGB disinformation specialist, it said.
   In 1973, Pankin was named president of the copyright
organization that handled sales of Soviet music and books abroad
and of foreign works to the Soviet Union. The book claimed the
office was a front for a KGB section responsible for disinformation
and Soviet propaganda abroad.
   ``Pankin, as head of Special Services A, must be one of the top
30 commanders within the KGB in Moscow, probably with the rank of a
major general,'' the book said.
   It said KGB agents here were engaged in political espionage,
counterespionage against East bloc refugees, industrial and
scientific intelligence, and planning sabotage operations in case
of war.
   ``It is impossible to prevent KGB men from coming here. If that
were the case, there would not be many people left at the Soviet
Embassy,'' the book quoted one veteran officer of Sweden's security
police as saying.
   ``Besides, it can be safer to know that the KGB personnel is at
the embassy. Then you know where you have them,'' the unidentified
officer said.
   Sweden commands a view of the Baltic Sea that is strategic for
both sides. The narrow straits between Sweden and Denmark, a NATO
country, are the only passage for the Soviet Baltic fleet to the
North Sea and the Atlantic.
   The book said agents from Warsaw Pact countries monitor NATO
activity in that area, while the CIA collects intelligence on East
bloc shipping.
   ``From Stockholm, the CIA is trying to track Czech and other
East European arms shipments to Nicaragua, southern Africa and
Cuba,'' the book said.
   Sweden's large community of refugees also has attracted agents
from countries like Iran, Iraq, Yugoslavia, Chile, and Libya to
watch exiled dissidents and opposition groups, it said.
   Iraq had made Sweden ``something of a European center of the
Iraqi security apparatus'' and had the third largest intelligence
operation here, it said.

<TEXT>
   How fares the shamrock this St. Patrick's
Day?
   Just fine, says botanist Charles Nelson, whose desk is cluttered
with samples from all over the country.
   The sprigs of green have been arriving in response to an appeal
by Nelson, who is conducting the first survey of the state of
Ireland's national plant in nearly a century.
   His timing is perfect, since Thursday is St. Patrick's Day, when
Irish minds turn to the ``chosen leaf of bard and chief, Old Erin's
native Shamrock'' and men, women and children adorn their lapels
with a sprig picked from garden, roadside or local supermarket.
   But the shamrock's life is as fleeting as a ray of sunshine in
the Irish rain, and by the end of Thursday's St. Patrick's Day
parade through Dublin the streets will be littered with wilted
shamrock.
   Myths galore surround the three-leafed weed.
   St. Patrick is supposed to have used the three leaves to explain
the Holy Trinity to a Gaelic chieftain. In the 18th century the
Irish establishment accepted it as a national symbol, like the
Welsh leek, Scottish thistle and English rose.
   It was later adopted as a symbol of defiance in the fight for
Ireland's independence from Britain.
   ``Viva la, the rose shall fade, And the shamrock shine for ever
new!'' sang Thomas Davis, the 19th-century rebel bard.
   Today the shamrock emblem adorns everything from the national
airline to bags of peat moss fertilizer.
   But what exactly is the shamrock?
   In 1893, Dublin legal clerk Nathaniel Colgan set out to
catalogue all the species, and concluded there were four main kinds.
   Nelson concludes the shamrock is merely a humble clover too
often dressed up in ``colorful legend and sentimental nonsense.''
The word shamrock derives from Seamrog, Irish for ``little
clover,'' he said.
   Nelson held up two plastic bags of shamrock. One, sent to him
from County Down in Northern Ireland, had large-leafed shamrocks.
The other, from County Wicklow in the south, had much smaller,
darker leaves.
   ``This one is shamrock because the person who collected it
believed it to be shamrock, and I accept that. And the same goes
for the other one too,'' he said in an interview.
   ``It's a matter of a rose by any other name smelling just as
sweet. A shamrock is what a person believes is shamrock,'' he said,
adding:
   ``Botanically the plants used as shamrock are in fact clover.
But if you tell an Irishman that he's wearing clover, not shamrock,
he will feel insulted.''
   Tom Coleman, who markets shamrock souvenirs, has his own
definition: ``You know it when you see it.''
   Coleman's factory 100 miles south of Dublin, turns out 300,000
souvenirs a year, from key rings to ornamental plates, all
decorated with real shamrock preserved by a secret formula.
   ``We have a shamrock here that's 17 years old and still green,''
he said.
   Nelson said there was no basis for the story about St. Patrick
and the shamrock, saying that only in 1650, more than 1,000 years
after the patron saint of Ireland lived, was the shamrock first
recorded as being something more than an weed.

   In an off-the-cuff comment Wednesday that he
immediately regretted, President Reagan said that he sometimes has
not told Congress all that it wants to know.
   The incident occurred when reporters asked Reagan about his
contention that he knew of no laws being broken in the Iran-Contra
affair. If that were so, he was asked, why did Robert McFarlane,
his former national security adviser, plead guilty last week to
four misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress?
   ``He just pleaded guilty to not telling Congress everything it
wanted to know. I've done that myself,'' Reagan said.
   When reporters pursued his comment, Reagan quickly said, ``Now
don't distort that. No. I just mean ... I just think Congress would
like to be asking questions about almost anything, anytime.''
   Trying to cut off the conversation, Reagan said, ``This is in
the courts. Let's wait and determine whether they say the law has
been broken.''
   As reporters were escorted from the room, Reagan turned to his
guest, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, and said in a whisper:
   ``Oh boy. Just for that careless remark ... they'll go wild
about Reagan wants to lie to Congress or something.''
   The remark was picked up by a microphone.

<HEAD>Legislatures May Be Able To Reverse Tuition Guarantee Tax Ruling</HEAD>

   States may be able to avoid paying federal
taxes on college tuition prepayment plans simply by rewriting laws
governing such programs, a tax law expert said Wednesday.
   ``If you can drag it kicking and screaming into the normal
function of a state governent,'' then a legal case could be made
that earnings on a guaranteed college tuition trust's investments
should be free of federal taxes, said Lawrence A. Jegen, an Indiana
University law professor who also heads Indiana's tuition-guarantee
program, BEST.
   The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that the Michigan
Education Trust would be required to pay federal taxes on its
earnings, although individual investors in the trust would have no
additional tax liability, Michigan Gov. James Blanchard said
Tuesday.
   Five states, including Indiana, have adopted tuition-guarantee
programs modeled after Michigan's.
   Under the programs, parents who make advance payments into the
trust fund are guaranteed that when their child is ready to enter a
state college or university they can do so without additional cost.
The payments typically can be made either all at once or
periodically.
   The states invest the money, so the amount parents must pay
depends upon not only the child's age when the payment is made and
the estimated cost of tuition when the child reaches 18 but also on
estimates of the trust's return on its investment.
   Michigan Treasurer Robert Bowman estimated the IRS ruling could
add 20 percent to the cost of investing in the Michigan trust, if
the trust was fully invested in taxable bonds.
   Jegen said that because the IRS said parents would not have to
pay taxes on their investments, state legislatures would have an
opening for rewriting their laws.
   ``If they (IRS) have concluded that the investors are not
subject to taxation, they have to have done that on some basis,
that once you put your money away, the funds are no longer yours,
that you are not an annual beneficiary of that fund,'' Jegen said.
``Once you separate the investors from the tax consequences and
maybe conclude that the fund is subject to taxation, ... it would
be a fairly small step to have that fund be a part of the state
operations, so much so that it would not be subject to taxation.''
   Constitutionally, the federal government cannot tax the state in
the performance of the functions a state is expected to perform,
Jegen said.
   ``The further away you get from a governmental function, the
more likely it is to be taxable,'' he said.
   For example, a license plate for a car is not subject to federal
taxes because providing license plates is a normal state function,
he said. Proceeds from the sales of textbooks at a campus bookstore
are taxable, because a state is not expected to be in the business
of selling books.
   Jegen said he had not seen the ruling, and his final analysis
would depend in part on the IRS' precise argument.
   The IRS, citing privacy considerations, would not explain the
ruling, nor would it confirm a ruling had been made.
   Besides Indiana, Wyoming, Maine, Florida and Tennessee have
adopted guaranteed tuition programs similar to Michigan's.

   Auto speed king Mickey Thompson and his
wife were shot to death this morning in the driveway of their
exclusive hillside home in what authorities said was ``an
assassination'' by two gunmen who fled on bicycles.
   Thompson, 59, and his wife, Trudy, were found dead at dawn by
Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies responding to reports of
gunfire, said Deputy Doug Gatlin.
   ``It was a double homicide, an assassination,'' said Deputy
Richard Dinsmoor.
   Neighbors said they heard 6 or 8 shots before the bodies were
found about 6 a.m. on the driveway in front of the couple's
Spanish-style home on Woodlyn Road in a high-security, gated
community 20 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   They were shot to death, but the type of weapon wasn't
disclosed, Dinsmoor said. The Thompsons were walking out to their
van when they were ambushed.
   ``We don't know a motive,'' said Deputy Dan Cox.
   Doug Stokes, spokesman for Thompson Entertainment Group in
Anaheim, said the Thompson's were apparently leaving the house for
work when the shooting occurred. He said he didn't know of any
threats against the Thompsons.
   Thompson became famous as the ``Speed King'' in the 1950s when
he set the first of his nearly 500 auto speed and endurance records.
   In 1960 he became the first to travel over 400 mph on land when
he drove a four-engine streamlined car to a speed of 406.6 mph at
the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.
   He later turned to drag racing, Indianapolis car racing, won a
national economy championship and was a top competitor in road
racing and off-road championships in the United States and Mexico.
   He was a drag racing innovator, building and driving the sport's
first ``slingshot'' dragster. He worked in the 1950s to take the
sport off the streets onto sanctioned drag racing strips, and he
was honored by the California Senate for his contributions to the
youth of the state as well as the automotive industry.
   He was also well known as a promoter and his other sports
activities included stunt flying and management of prizefighters.
   In pursuit of his land speed and Indy-car projects, Thompson
often teamed with one of the auto industry's leading figures, Semon
``Bunkie'' Knudsen.
   Knudsen was a top executive with General Motors Corp. when he
backed the Thompson effort to break 400 mph. Later, when Knudsen
moved from GM to become president of Ford Motor Co., Thompson got
company help with his own design of a Ford-powered dune buggy racer.
   As a racer, Thompson often failed to finish events because of
mechanical breakdowns. He failed to finish in the first 27
powerboat races that he entered. He brought custom machines to
Indianapolis racing in the early 1960s, but again the cars he
designed were fast but not durable.
   Longtime friend Carroll Shelby described him as ``one of the
greatest hot-rodders we've ever had'' and ``the dominant figure in
off-road racing.''
   ``He certainly had a colorful career,'' Shelby said. ``We're all
going to miss him.''
   When he was 12, Thompson ended his first race at Lakeland Park
in nearby El Monte by crashing his four-cylinder Ford Model B hot
rod against a wall during the first lap.
   He wasn't hurt because he was wearing a football helmet and was
strapped inside with clothesline rope since he couldn't afford a
real crash helmet or seat belts.
   Racing put him in the hospital 27 times, including a seven-month
stay when he was paralyzed from the waist down after a boat racing
accident. It was two years before he walked again.
   Thompson had a variety of other careers. He swept floors at the
Los Angeles Times and later wrote sports articles there (``Just to
see if I could.''), sold 10-cent hamburgers at a drive-in, produced
and directed racing movies, owned 29 different businesses (``Every
one of them has made money'') and was mayor of Rolling Hills.
   Danny Thompson, the couple's 37-year-old son who is also an
off-road racer, wasn't immediately available for comment, said his
publicist Carolyn Williams.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Sees Bill Threatened by Push for Home Care Subsidies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill to protect families from the financial
threat of catastrophic illness is being threatened by a competing
push for new subsidies for home health care, the chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee said Wednesday.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., told reporters he believes the
House and Senate, which passed different version of the
catastrophic health care bill, can agree on a version President
Reagan could sign.
   A Senate plan to phase in prescription drug benefits, as opposed
to a House provision putting them in place immediately, could keep
down costs, Rostenkowski said. That would make the bill more
acceptable to the president, who first proposed the catastrophic
coverage in his State of the Union address last year, he said.
   The catastrophic bill was being threatened, however, by Rep.
Claude Pepper's push for legislation to expand Medicare to include
home health care subsidies for the disabled and chronically ill, he
said.
   Pepper, D-Fla., chairman of the House Rules Committee and at 87
the oldest member of Congress, got the chamber's leadership to
schedule a vote on his five-year, $25 billion plan although it had
not gone through the normal committee channels. Rostenkowski's
tax-writing committee did not examine the proposal, which would be
financed by raising Medicare taxes.
   Rostenkowski said some health advocates were telling lawmakers
to support the home care bill instead of the less-costly
catastrophic insurance measure on the ground it is a more pressing
need.
   He said there is a lot of political allure to having the
government help people with those home health costs, especially in
an election year.
   ``I don't know whether any candidate, looking toward November,
can say no to that,'' Rostenkowski said.
   He said supporters were trying to push the bill through without
the study needed to make it work.
   ``I doubt very much that I will support ... the Pepper bill,''
Rostenkowski said. ``You're raising big bucks, and you're changing
the whole direction of the health care system.''
   There was no reason Congress could not eventually move forward
on both measures, but trying to do both this year would likely
result in neither getting done, Rostenkowski said.
   ``I'm trying to get one bill passed, and that's catastrophic
health,'' he said.

<HEAD>Golden Fleece Award To Study That Shows Quail Sex Improves With
Practice</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. William Proxmire gave his ``Golden
Fleece'' award Wednesday to two government agencies for a $107,000
study that found the sexual performance of Japanese quail improved
with practice.
   ``This project gives new meaning to bird watching,'' Proxmire
said of the study, ``Learning and Reproductive Behavior.'' The
research concluded that a peeping tom quail was much more
interested in watching a female quail _ dead or alive _ than in
looking at another male or even a female duck.
   Proxmire, a Wisconsin Democrat, presents the ``Fleece'' each
month to recognize what he considers a waste of taxpayer money.
   Proxmire said that since songwriter Cole Porter made clear years
ago that ``birds do it ...'' what need is there for research into
``stimuli and responses ... involved in various components of their
sexual behavior?''
   There's plenty of need, said Jack Renirie, a spokesman for the
National Science Foundation, which is sharing funds for the study
with the National Institute of Mental Health.
   ``This was a study of learning _ not of the quail,'' Renirie
said in a telephone interview. ``The quail was chosen because it is
an easily available laboratory animal that readily engages in the
behavior that he (the researcher) wants to study.
   ``One reason he's studying learning in connection with
reproduction is that reproduction happens to be one of the real
strong motivating factors in animals,'' he said.
   Renirie recalled similar criticism several years ago when
another government agency was researching the sex life of the
screwworm fly. That research, he said, enabled scientists to halt
destruction of herds of cattle by the fly.
   According to a summary by the foundation, the quail research
could even provide answers to the spread of AIDS.
   The ``research will ... tell us about an aspect of sexual
behavior that has received little systematic attention to date,''
the foundation said. ``Given the life-threatening nature of certain
forms of sexual behavior with the spread of AIDS, knowledge of how
sexual habits are acquired is very important.''
   The foundation selected Japanese quail for the study because of
its uninhibited mating habits. ``When a sexually mature male is
placed with a female, copulation occurs rapidly, often in less than
five minutes,'' the foundation said.
   Researchers were interested in three ``sexual learning
phenomena: sexual looking, classical conditioning of sexual arousal
and improvement in copulatory performance with practice.''
   Proxmire said the study ``found that practice improved sexual
performance. Even the most inhibited males `eventually acquired as
vigorous performance as all other subjects.'''
   It also found that the male quail spent a considerable amount of
time staring at the female through a small window in a cage.
   ``The `sexual looking' phenomenon was so strong that these
amorous males didn't seem to care whether or not the female
recipient of their longing glances was alive or dead,'' Proxmire
told colleagues. ``However, these male quail showed a distinct
viewing preference for female quail over male quail or female
ducks.''
   Although the research ``may be well designed and carefully
executed, the question remains whether, with massive federal
deficits and limited funds for scientific research, spending for
this project is the best use of taxpayers' monies,'' Proxmire said.
   The National Science Foundation funded the early parts of the
quail research, through March 1987; the National Institute of
Mental Health has been backing the study since. Proxmire said
another $100,000-plus is expected to be spent by NIMH _ for a total
of more than $200,000 _ over the next two years.

   A 94-year-old man's offer of $10,000 to
anyone who can end his 65 years of hiccuping has drawn some exotic
nostrums _ dill seed, magnesium phosphate, holy water, Indian hemp,
among them _ but the man hiccups on.
   ``Unbelievable,'' Lucretia Peterson of rural Aitkin said as she
sifted through some of the more than 5,000 letters, cassettes, and
parcels that have poured into her home from Europe and North
America since her father, Charlie Osborne, offered the reward in
January.
   ``People really care. Even though the $10,000 is a big deal to
some of them, a lot say keep the money and spend it in good health.
It's unbelievable for that many people to write in this day and
age,'' she said.
   Suggested remedies have ranged from homespun concoctions
involving sugar and vinegar to scientific nerve-treatment regimens
complete with detailed diagrams. Others endorse the healing powers
of the mind.
   A Santa Monica, Calif., massage therapist explained how she
cured a 75-year-old woman of a life-long burping problem and
offered to work similar magic on Osborne.
   A man from Italy sent a brown dust, explaining it is ``vegetable
powder'' that will cure hiccups if inserted in the nostrils. A
German suggests pressing the right thumb against the little finger,
while a Canadian swears that finger pressure applied to the bottom
of the nose just right will expel the demon.
   Many of the would-be healers have the utmost confidence in their
cures.
   One writer from Germany advised Osborne that a money order was
the preferred means of payment, while a Minnesota man pleaded:
``Please don't tell anyone who cured you. I don't want to go on TV
and I don't want the IRS taking a big cut of a gift between
friends.''
   Osborne, who recently returned to his longtime home of Anthon,
Iowa, after spending six months in Aitkin, 100 miles northwest of
Minneapolis, has seen only a few hundred of the letters, and his
family won't permit him to try the various elixirs.
   The messages that have been forwarded to Osborne have lifted his
spirits, though not his hopes for a cure, said another daughter,
Melissa Smith, who lives in Anthon and takes care of him. Osborne
suffers from a gall bladder condition and other ailments, Ms.
Peterson has said.
   The letter that meant the most to him, said Mrs. Smith, came
from a 17-year-old boy who describes his recent conversion to
Christianity and suggests faith might be Osborne's best hope for
relief.
   ``He thought it was just a real touching letter,'' Mrs. Smith
said.
   The outpouring began after Osborne told Ken Hanson, a reporter
for the Brainerd Daily Dispatch, that he would pay a $10,000 reward
for a cure. An Associated Press report on the offer appeared in
newspapers throughout Europe and North America.
   Osborne, who has yet to get a phone connected in his new home,
could not be reached for comment.
   The international interest ``is exciting to him,'' Mrs. Smith
said. ``He doesn't know what to think of it sometimes. He gets all
this stuff in the mail, but I won't let him have any (of the
potions) because you never know.''
   A cure would still be most welcome, his family said. A case that
has stumped scores of doctors, Osborne's hiccups are constant,
painful and disruptive. They make eating solid food impossible and
cause frequent vomiting, his family said.
   Osborne himself theorizes that his malady is the result of nerve
damage suffered 66 years ago when he over-exerted himself lifting a
hog on his farm. He said he has hiccuped ever since.
   The Guinness Book of World Records estimates he has hiccuped
430,000,000 times, calling it the longest-ever recorded attack of
the hiccups.
   After all the years of failed advice from doctors, quacks,
philanthropists and opportunists, Osborne is pretty much resigned
to hiccuping the rest of his life, said Ms. Peterson.
   ``He's tried so many thousands of things,'' she said.

   The government announced federal grand jury
indictments today against seven people, including current and
former Cook County judges, bringing to 87 the number of people
charged in the Operation Greylord corruption probe.
   The newest charges in the probe of the nation's largest local
court system target Judge John J. McDonnell, 52, and retired Judge
Francis J. Maher Sr., 73.
   They are accused of accepting cash bribes from lawyers to fix
misdemeanor cases, according to U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas.
   Others indicted include a Cook County deputy sheriff, a court
clerk, a police officer and two attorneys, Valukas said at a
morning news conference.
   They were charged with a variety of crimes ranging from
extortion, lying to a grand jury and income tax fraud.
   The new accusations bring to 15 the number of judges charged
since the Greylord investigation began producing indictments in
December 1983, Valukas said. Twelve judges have been convicted and
one was acquitted, he said.
   Valukas said the investigation would continue.
   McDonnell was charged with racketeering, extortion, obstruction
of justice and tax evasion. He faces a maximum sentence of 74 years
in prison and a $255,000 fine if convicted, Valukas said.
   Maher was charged with racketeering and racketeering conspiracy
and faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and a $50,000
fine if convicted, Valukas said.

   Thousands of demonstrators poured
into the streets of the capital today after rebellious soldiers
failed to seize the headquarters of the nation's military
strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   It was the largest outpouring of opposition to the
military-dominated government since civilian opponents began trying
to force Noriega's departure as head of the Panama Defense Forces
last summer.
   Protesters erected flaming barricades across hundreds of streets
throughout Panama City. In the capital's financial and tourist
district, as well as the poorer sections of the downtown business
center, people chanted: ``Noriega must go. ... Noreiga, tyrant,
your end is near.''
   Starting at about 8:15 a.m., nearby residents heard the sharp
clatter of light arms fire inside the walled headquarters of the
Panama Defense Forces. It continued for at least half an hour.
   ``They were kisses,'' Noreiga said in response to reporters'
questions about the gunshots about an hour after the firing ended.
   Noriega appeared at the top of a stairway on one side of the
headquarters building dressed in civilian clothes and accompanied
by members of his high command. To reporters' shouted questions,
the general responded: ``What happened is that you are visiting us
here.''
   Boris Moreno, a civilian spokesman for the government, said a
small group of lower-ranking officers had attempted a coup and that
several were detained.
   A revolt in the military would be a serious blow to Noriega, who
heads the nation's 15,000-member Defense Forces and is considered
to be the real power behind Panama's civilian government.
   Washington has been exerting pressure to drive him from power.
President Reagan said Tuesday the United States wants him ``out of
there.'' The economy has been crippled by U.S. sanctions.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined comment on the
trouble in Panama. ``I don't have any information to confirm the
report. We are aware there is turmoil in the city.''
   In Washington, the Pentagon announced the U.S. Southern Command
had ordered U.S. servicemen and their dependents ``not to go into
public areas except for essential business.''
   Officials of the Panama Canal Commission in Washington confirmed
that a coup was attempted and said roads leading to the canal had
been blocked. The Defense Forces had closed off the entrance to a
U.S. air base near the canal administrative headquarters in Balboa,
on the Pacific side, they said.
   ``The canal area is pretty well isolated,'' William R. Gianelli,
chairman of the commission's board of directors, told the House
Transportation Appropriations subcommittee. ``But it is hard to
tell from here exactly what that means.''
   Dennis P. McAuliffe, administrator of the commission, said he
``would not regard (the blockade) as a hostile act at this moment.''
   Earlier, two Associated Press reporters and a photographer were
stopped by soldiers as they approached the headquarters, forced
from their car and marched into the compound at gunpoint.
   As they were being held inside, they saw at least one officer
with his hands behind his head being taken into a barracks behind
the headquarters building. But a captain told them the apparent
prisoner was simply taking part ``in a simulated exercise.''
   The captain, who declined to identify himself and wore no name
tag, said units at the headquarters periodically conduct training
exercises aimed at halting coup attempts.
   ``Everything is normal,'' he said.
   Hundreds of soldiers in battle gear surrounded the headquarters,
in one of the older sections of Panama City. Residents were kept at
least a block away from the compound.
   Reports said the coup attempt was led by the 3rd Infantry
Company of the 5th Battallon from Chiriqui Province, bordering
Panama's frontier with Costa Rican. The light infantry company is
known as the ``Diablos Rojos,'' or Red Devils.
   In Venezuela, Panamanian Roberto Diaz Herrera said today Noreiga
was ``very angry'' following the reported coup attempt, but was
still in control of the situation. Diaz Herrera, a former colonel
who has been in exile since December, said he spoke with Noriega by
telephone at about 10 a.m.
   ``He sounded either drunk or drugged and he was very angry,''
Diaz Herrera told The Associated Press shortly after the
conversation. ``It seems (Noriega's supporters) still have control
of the situation.''
   Diaz was second in command to Noriega before accusing the
general of having ordered political assassinations and being
involved in drug trafficking.
   Noriega was indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida last
month on narcotics trafficking charges that link him with the
notorious Medellin drug cartel of Colombia. He has denied the
accusations.
   On Feb. 25, President Eric Arturo Delvalle announced he was
dismissing Noriega as defense chief and replacing him with Col.
Marcos Justines, chief of staff. Justines refused the job.
   The Noriega-dominate National Assembly quickly ousted Delvalle
and named Education Minister Manuel Solis Palma the new head of
state.
   Widespread protests and general strikes followed.

   Morton Thiokol Inc. has been fined $31,700
for six violations of state health and safety rules following an
investigation of a fire that destroyed an MX missile production
building and killed five workers, officials said today.
   Utah State Office of Safety and Health said it found three
violations it characterized as willful and serious for deviations
from UOSH rules. Two other alleged violations were classified as
serious and one was classified as ``other than serious.''
   The state agency, which released its findings today, said the
cause of the Dec. 29 fire was not determined by its investigators.
   ``Deference is given to the Air Force investigation as to the
most likely causes of the fire,'' wrote Douglas J. McVey, UOSH
administrator.
   Morton Thiokol has 30 calendar days in which to appeal the
citations and civil assessments to the independent Utah
Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.
   Morton Thiokol planned to respond to the state charges Thursday,
company spokesman Rocky Raab said.
   Authorities believe the fire in building M-592 at the company's
plant 25 miles west of Brigham City broke out as workers were
removing casting forms from the first stage of an MX missile motor.
   Morton Thiokol makes the MX missile's four stages, and also
makes the space shuttle's solid-fuel rocket boosters, which failed
when the Challenger blew up in January 1986.
   The three alleged willful and serious violations, each carrying
a $10,000 penalty, related to omissions in following company safety
procedures adopted in conformance with state rules.
   ``Deviations did not have written management approval;
appropriate personnel protection was not provided, nor was remote
control used, and equipment was not used to assure ground
continuity,'' McVey wrote.
   The two serious violations, carrying $1,700 in penalties between
them, related to a lack of safety requirements in management's
written operating rules and practices.
   McVey pointed out that the UOSH rules governing employee safety
in explosive materials manufacturing ``requires strict employer
accountability as to compliance.''
   He said Morton Thiokol officials had fully participated in
development and adoption of the rules in 1982. He added they are
unique to Utah and have no federal equivalent.
   The last alleged violation, characterized as ``other than
serious,'' related to the presence of an unauthorized crowbar in a
restricted area.

   Gov. Evan Mecham's former appointments
secretary testified at his impeachment trial today that campaign
contributions were a criterion, but not a major one, in making
appointments to state boards and commissions.
   Sam Udall also testified that he did not immediately realize
that two proposed appointees to the Housing Finance Review Board
were recommended by Barry Wolfson, who provided a $350,000 campaign
loan to Mecham. One of the three impeachment counts accuses the
governor of concealing the loan.
   The state Senate also voted today to lengthen daily sessions in
an effort to speed it up.
   The trial began Feb. 29, and senators have complained that the
trial is moving too slowly and there might not be time to reach a
verdict before Mecham's May 17 recall election.
   They voted 21-6 to add two hours of testimony a day, subject to
change if the new eight-hour schedule proves too heavy.
   The first-term Republican governor was likely to testify this
afternoon as the last defense witness on the first impeachment
count, said his attorney, Fred Craft.
   On Tuesday, a woman who claims to be the former lover of
Arizona's top police officer testified that he is a liar who had
ambitions to be governor.
   Christina Johnston testified Tuesday that her relationship with
Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead was ``intimate
and personal.''
   Milstead has accused Mecham of obstructing justice by ordering
him not to cooperate with an investigation of an alleged death
threat against a former Mecham aide who was to testify before a
grand jury about the $350,000 campaign loan.
   Mrs. Johnston, asked Tuesday about her opinion of Milstead's
overall truthfulness, said, ``He's a liar. He's corrupt, he's an
egomaniac and he's power-hungry. I'm sorry, but that's the truth.''
   Mrs. Johnston said Milstead told her in 1982 he wanted to be
governor because it was ``an easy job.''
   ``It seems like everything that he does is for his own pleasure
and he wants people to see that he's Tarzan,'' she said.
   Milstead was in Israel attending an anti-terrorism conference,
and DPS spokesman Sgt. Allan Schmidt declined to comment on Mrs.
Johnston's statements. When the DPS director testified before the
Senate, he said he knew her as an informant but he was not asked
about any alleged sexual relationship.
   Prosecutor William French asked Mrs. Johnston only one question:
``I get the impression you don't like Colonel Milstead, is that
correct?''
   ``At this time I'm very disgusted with him,'' she replied.
   In an affidavit to senators, Mrs. Johnston claimed to have had
an affair with Milstead. The trial's presiding judge, Frank X.
Gordon Jr., disallowed testimony about the matter.
   Gordon, the state Supreme Court's chief justice, renewed that
ruling Tuesday after a lengthy exchange in which prosecutor Paul
Eckstein repeatedly objected to defense lawyer Fred Craft's
questioning of Mrs. Johnston.
   ``Maybe I just don't understand the rules,'' Craft protested.
   ``That may be a good statement,'' Gordon replied.
   At one point, Mrs. Johnston contended that Milstead believed
``if you don't have money or a title, you're a loser.''
   Republican Sen. Peter Kay commented, ``What you've just
described is someone who's proud of his own achievements in life.''
   Attorney A. Melvin McDonald, who represents Mecham aide Ray
Russell, testified Tuesday that he believed Milstead had a good
professional reputation.
   McDonald said he was not surprised by the allegation that
then-state official Lee Watkins had threatened the life of former
Mecham aide Donna Carlson. At the time of the alleged Nov. 12
threat, Ms. Carlson was about to testify before a state grand jury
regarding Mecham's failure to report the campaign loan.
   ``To me it was just Lee Watkins shooting his mouth off again,''
McDonald said. Watkins has denied making a threat.
   Mecham has acknowledged that he may have told Milstead not to
cooperate with the attorney general, but the governor has insisted
he was not informed there was a serious threat that involved
possible witness tampering.
   Lt. Col. Gary Phelps, deputy director of the Department of
Public Safety, testified today that the handling of the alleged
threat was ``very bizarre.''
   ``In my perception I had one grand jury witness, Lee Watkins,
threaten a second grand jury witness, Donna Carlson; we reported it
to a third grand jury witness, the governor, who then asked a
fourth grand jury witness, Max Hawkins, to look at it,'' Phelps
said.
   He also said he did not advise Mecham on how to handle the
situation because the governor has his own advisers, including a
new chief of staff who was a former U.S. attorney.
   The House impeached Mecham, 63, on Feb. 5, and accused him of
attempting to block the death threat probe, concealing the $350,000
campaign loan and misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol
fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   He faces an April 21 criminal trial on charges of hiding the
$350,000 loan, and a May 17 recall election.
   Mecham is the first U.S. governor to be impeached in nearly six
decades. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required to
convict him.

   A woman's 36-year bout of the hiccups stopped
after she was given a drug to treat her newly diagnosed Parkinson's
disease, a team of Israeli doctors said.
   Until then, the 75-year-old woman's ``hiccup bouts were almost
continuous, with rare remissions lasting a maximum of six to eight
weeks,'' the doctors wrote in a letter in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine.
   ``Even during the periods of remission, sporadic hiccups were
observed. She had been hospitalized several times and had undergone
a great many tests.''
   The hiccups immediately stopped when she got the drug amantadine
for Parkinson's disease. The doctors theorized that the disease was
somehow responsible for the hiccups.
   The treatment was reported by Dr. J.J.M. Askenasy of Tel Aviv
University and colleagues from Hasharon Hospital.
   In a separate letter, Drs. Izidore S. Lossos and Raphael Breuer
of Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem described another odd
case of hiccuping, this one involving a 19-year-old woman.
   She complained of a two-hour bout of hiccups along with an
unpleasant itching sensation in her left ear. The doctors found
that both problems were caused by an ant that had crawled into her
ear.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Grand Jury Deliberates on Indictment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury investigating the Iran-Contra
affair on Wednesday considered a prosecutor's request for an
indictment charging criminal violations by key participants in the
worst scandal of the Reagan administration.
   The special federal grand jury that has been investigating the
case nearly 14 months began deliberations after independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh made a personal appearance with several of his
top assistants.
   Charges long have been expected against former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter, his one-time aide Lt. Col. Oliver L.
North and two arms dealers, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord and his business partner, Albert Hakim.
   North, who was fired from his job as a National Security Council
aide in late 1986, meanwhile, went to confer with his defense
attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr.
   After making his appearance, Walsh retired to a small office set
aside for him in the U.S. Courthouse to be ready in case the grand
jurors had questions about the contents of the indictment they were
being asked to approve.
   As he left the grand jury room, Walsh declined to comment except
to say: ``these things can take a long time'' _ an apparent
reference to the panel's discussion of the proposed indictment.
   Other prosecutors on Walsh's staff continued to make a
presentation but left the grand jury room, apparently to allow the
grand jury to study the proposed indictment. They were summoned
briefly to the grand jury room before the panel took a one-hour
lunch break.
   For several weeks, Walsh has signaled that he is prepared to
bring criminal charges stemming from his investigation into the
arms-for-hostages deals with Iran and the diversion of profits from
the weapons sales to the Nicraguan rebels.
   The diversion of nearly $4 million in profits from the arms
sales occurred at a time when Congress had banned direct U.S.
military aid to the Contras.
   For the last two weeks, teams of prosecutors from Walsh's office
have been meeting with the grand jury, presumably to make
presentation of the evidence submitted to the panel during its
investigation.
   Marshaling of the evidence in a grand jury investigation is a
common practice of prosecutors, particularly in a lengthy inquiry
such as the one Walsh has been conducting since the panel was
convened in late January 1987.
   Last week, former national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane
pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor charges that he withheld
information from Congress in 1985 and in 1986 by denying that
members of his staff, particularly North, were helping raise
private money to arm the Contras during the congressionally imposed
ban on U.S. military aid.
   Walsh also recently hired Herbert Stern, a former federal judge,
to contest what he called legal challenges to possible prosecutions
from prospective defendants who received congressional immunity for
their testimony at hearings last summer.
   North and Poindexter both testified before the joint
House-Senate Iran-Contra committee hearings under grants of limited
immunity from prosecution. The immunity prohibits Walsh from using
any information gleaned from their testimony as evidence against
them.
   Both are expected to claim that Walsh made improper use of their
testimony in obtaining the indictments. To counter that claim,
Walsh has carefully placed evidence he has gathered under court
seal to prove that he obtained it independently of the
congressional hearings.
   Last spring, two conservative fund-raisers, Carl R. ``Spitz''
Channell and Richard Miller, pleaded guilty to felony charges that
they conspired with North to illegally use a tax-exempt foundation
for the purpose of raising money for the Contras. Both are
cooperating with Walsh's investigation.
   The 1985-1986 sales to Iran were part of an effort to trade arms
for U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian terrorist
organizations.
   Congressional investigators determined that of the $16 million
in profits from the arms sales, $3.8 million went to the Contras
when the congressional ban on direct U.S. military aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels was in effect.
   The administration also raised $34 million in donations to the
Contras from foreign countries and another $2.7 million from
private sources, according to the report of the congressional
investigation.

   Munusamy Gunasekaran sleeps on the
job, but his boss doesn't mind.
   Gunasekaran is one of 34 volunteers hired by the Health
Department to act as ``human bait'' to attract and catch mosquitoes
as part of a program that helps keep this city of 1 million people
free of malaria.
   The volunteers are paid between $120 and $160 a month to sleep
in small huts on a bed surrounded by mosquito netting.
   The mosquitoes are attacted by the scent of the men inside the
hut and the light from small hurricane lamps hanging by the doors,
said Muthuthamby Balakrishnan, a senior assistant in the city's
Public Health Department.
   ``The man who is acting as the human bait gets up from the bed,
comes out of the net and catches the mosquitoes,'' Balakrishnan
said.
   ``He shines a powerful torch (flashlight) on the mosquito and
for a few moments it does not fly away. The light has this effect
on it. He places a test tube over it and traps it,'' he said.
   In addition, eight ``bare-leg catchers'' are paid to sit
outdoors in various districts of Kuala Lumpur. They roll up their
trousers and allow mosquitoes to settle on their legs, where the
insects are trapped.
   The specimens are sent to the Institute of Medical Research,
which determines if any are Anopheles Maculaeus mosquitoes, the
malaria carriers.
   If so, health department officials check the vicinity for any
mosquito breeding areas and spray them with insecticide, said
Balakrishnan, who has been supervising the mosquito control effort
for 25 years.
   In addition to the men who serve as bait, the city also has
mosquito traps scattered around the city. Last year, 34 Anopheles
Maculaeus mosquitoes were found in eight areas of Kuala Lumpur, he
said.
   There are no special requirements for being a mosquito catcher,
although they have to be in good health for the all-night
occupation.
   Gunasekaran, 30, says people may joke that he's being paid to
sleep on the job, but actually he's able to nod off only
intermittently because ``every couple of hours we have to get up,
catch the mosquitoes and then lie down.''
   Gunasekaran, who is married with two children and works a day
job as a gardener, said he traps about 20 to 30 mosquitoes a night,
but rarely are any of them the malaria-bearing variety.
   He has worked at the job for five years. Some of his colleagues
have been at it for more than 25 years.
   Catchers work two shifts a night, seven days a week and on
holidays. The shifts are from 6 p.m. to midnight, and midnight to 6
a.m.
   None of the men has caught malaria, although their blood is
tested every six months as a precaution, said Appalasamy Gangaraj,
another public health official.
   Dr. James Soosaipillai, director of the health department, said
malaria is virtually non-existent in Kuala Lumpur. Only one
resident was diagnosed with it last year and probably caught it
while traveling outside Kuala Lumpur, he said.
   Soosaipillai said the ``human bait'' project for controlling
malaria-bearing mosquitoes was set up by the British colonial
government long before Malaysian independence in 1957.
   Throughout Malaysia, cases of malaria are diminishing but the
disease still poses a threat.
   Deputy Health Minister Kunjambu Pathmanabhan said 77 percent of
Malaysia is free of malaria.
   Dr. Chun Chee Tsun, director of the government's Vector-Borne
Diseases Control, said there were 36,175 cases of malaria and 75
deaths reported last year, compared with 44,145 cases and 62 deaths
in 1986, and 49,526 cases and 106 deaths in 1985.
   The majority of the deaths were on Borneo island and involved
illegal immigrants who were reluctant to seek medical attention,
Chong said.

   Job prospects for both production and service
workers are the brightest they have been in three years but are
declining slightly for technical, professional and office workers,
according to a private survey released Wednesday.
   Twenty-one percent of the 398 corporations and organizations
surveyed said they anticipate expanding their production and
service work forces from April through June. A year ago just 15
percent of the surveyed employers expected an increase in hiring.
   But only 19 percent of the companies surveyed by the Bureau of
National Affairs, a private publisher of business research, said
they plan to increase their technical and professional staffs, down
from 21 percent for the first quarter of this year.
   And just 13 percent, down from 16 percent for the first quarter,
said they expect their office and clerical pools to grow this
spring.
   The greatest hiring boom for production and service workers is
expected in the upper Midwest, the last region to recover from the
1981-82 recession. Twenty-four percent of employers there, up from
15 percent a year, said they will expand their payrolls this spring.
   An equal expansion in hiring of technical and professional
workers is anticipated in the South. But it is offset by a
decrease, from 17 percent this quarter to 13 percent in the spring,
of companies in the West that plan to hire more people in those
occupations.
   Fewer companies also anticipated layoffs this spring, except for
office and clerical workers, according to the survey.

   Vice President George Bush may have a virtual
lock on the Republican presidential nomination, but his prospects
for winning the general election are far less assured, poll
analysts said Wednesday.
   Indeed, some polls indicate that Sen. Bob Dole, Bush's
all-but-vanquished Republican opponent, could be as strong or
stronger as the GOP nominee in the fall. Dole has argued that he
would be more likely than Bush to win the presidency if nominated.
   Bush ``has certain weaknesses vis-a-vis Dole,'' said Doug
Muzzio, an ABC News poll analyst. While the flaws are not decisive,
``it certainly indicates he's not a prohibitive favorite to beat a
Democrat,'' Muzzio said.
   One potential problem is Bush's failure thus far to win strong
backing of independents. While Bush swept the Republicans in
Illinois on Tuesday, Dole won 46 percent of the independents voting
in the GOP primary, to 42 percent for Bush, ABC's exit poll said.
   Because Republicans are a minority of the nation's electorate,
``if Bush is going to win the general election he's got to start
attracting independent voters,'' said Warren Mitofsky, chief of
polling at CBS News.
   Dole also has shown more potential appeal to Democrats. An NBC
News-Wall Street Journal poll late last month said 24 percent of
Democrats might consider supporting Dole for president, to just 9
percent for Bush.
   Both Bush and Dole have been roughly in dead heats with
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in hypothetical contests, in
surveys by Louis Harris and Associates on Feb. 18-23, Time magazine
March 10, and Newsweek March 10-11. A USA Today poll March 9 also
put Bush in a tie with Dukakis; a Dole-Dukakis race was not
proposed.
   Bush did better in hypothetical contests against other potential
Democratic nominees, and analysts said he is likely to be perceived
as stronger as his primary victories mount.
   At the same time, Bush at the moment has the advantage of being
better known than the Democrats, and that, too, is likely to
change. And he may lose the bulk of undecided voters, who typically
turn against an incumbent, said David Clemm of the Gordon S. Black
Corp. polling firm.
   Exit polls on Bush's support in Illinois revealed ``little
chinks in his armor,'' said Sheldon Gawiser, a poll analyst for NBC
News. While 55 percent of Republican voters said Bush was tough
enough to be a good president, 24 percent said he was not and 21
percent were not sure, Gawiser noted.
   Also, while 30 percent said Bush would be a very strong leader,
42 percent said somewhat strong, 16 percent said not very strong, 6
percent said not at all strong and 6 percent didn't know. Neither
result showed the confidence that may be expected in such a strong
front-runner's own party, Gawiser said.
   Similarly, among the 23 percent of Republicans who said
leadership was a key issue, ABC News found that Dole and Bush split
the vote. Said Muzzio: ``A prohibitive front-runner should be
showing some leadership, particularly given the fact that he holds
the second-highest office in the land.''
   In another measure, 41 percent of Republican voters said Bush
had not fully disclosed his knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair; 32
percent said he had and 21 percent were not sure, NBC found. The
issue, while not key to most Republicans, could gain significance
in the general election, Gawiser said.
   Humphrey Taylor, president of Louis Harris and Associates,
suggested that one source of Bush's popularity among Republicans,
his closeness to President Reagan, could prove a liability with
many Democratic voters in November.
   ``Right now to guess whether it will be a close election or not
is premature,'' Taylor said. ``It is perfectly possible that Bush
could really firm up his support and be a very strong candidate.
It's equally possible the ground will move under his feet, and
he'll look very vulnerable.''

   A Confederate flag that sparked protests by
a black legislator has been pulled down from the entrance to the
state Capitol.
   The Confederacy's standard had flown over 14 Flags Plaza along
with the flags of Great Britain, France, Mexico, the Choctaw Indian
Nation and other states which once controlled what is now Oklahoma.
But now only one pole bearing the U.S. and Oklahoma flags stands
there.
   Helen Arnold, head of the Office of Public Affairs, said Tuesday
she ordered the flags removed as part of reconstruction work on the
plaza which began last fall. It wasn't clear when the flags came
down as many workers at the Capitol only noticed their absence
Tuesday.
   Arnold said there were no plans to put the flags back until the
Legislature and various commissions decided what to do with the
area to celebrate next year's centennial of the Land Run of 1889.
But she said, ``I think it's probable the flags will not go up
again.''
   The Confederate flag prompted a vigorous protest last year by
Rep. Don Ross, who asked Gov. Henry Bellmon to order it removed and
sought to have the state attorney general rule it illegal but was
denied both times.
   Ms. Arnold would not say whether Ross' protest led to the
removal of the flags.
   Ross said he had not been informed that the flags were not to go
back up, but he said he was ``delighted'' by their removal and did
not plan any further action.

   With her good looks and stylish
clothes, Raisa Gorbachev has given a new glamour to the image of
Soviet women as she accompanies her husband on his visits to the
West.
   In Belgrade, she has shown other sides of her character _ a
skill that matches her husband's in handling photographers, an eye
for detail and neatness.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Mrs. Gorbachev arrived in
Yugoslavia for an official visit Monday.
   When she joined her husband at a tree-planting ceremony Tuesday,
both Gorbachevs indicated they are meticulous housekeepers _
Mikhail, the farmer's son, scraping every last bit of earth off the
white marble surrounding the tree, and Raisa carefully watering
each side of the small plot where the larch was planted.
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Gorbachev displayed the same attention to
detail when touring a ritzy furniture store more like a Western
shop than those she knows from home.
   At one point, Mrs. Gorbachev appeared to think the store might
be a special closed shop, like those for the Soviet Communist elite.
   ``Why are there no shoppers here?'' she asked her guides.
   Mrs. Gorbachev was assured that the store was open to the
general public and closed only for her visit.
   Through detailed questioning, however, she learned that the
number of customers is dropping because Yugoslavia's triple-digit
inflation leaves most Belgraders little money to buy the luxury
furniture and household goods the store sells.
   Mrs. Gorbachev admitted to some trouble in getting used to
Yugoslavia's six- and seven-digit prices for everyday goods.
   ``These millions, they kill me,'' she joked as she paraded
around the store, closely examining the china, textiles, glassware,
beds and sofas she was shown.
   She seemed equally interested in a short fashion show and, ever
gracious with photographers, gladly consented to put her good looks
alongside those of the models and pose with them in a hail of
flashing camera lights.
   Her past as a lecturer in Marxism-Leninism showed through,
however, in clipped, schoolmarmish questioning of the store
employees who accompanied her.
   Her questions, delivered in a high, crisp voice, yielded a font
of information about everything from credit terms to manufacturing
sources.
   At one point, Mrs. Gorbachev took a determined bet with a store
employee that the carpet he was showing her was not all wool.
   She lost, exclaiming ``100 percent wool! I didn't think there
was such a thing today.''
   Picking up china, poking in refrigerators, checking mattresses
and other furniture, Mrs. Gorbachev seemed to drink in details.
   Such trips doubtless help her husband to fill in his picture of
the countries and cities he visits, yielding accounts of daily life
he cannot see while engrossed in political negotiations.
   Mrs. Gorbachev's costly clothes and prominence at her husband's
side have raised criticism at home. Critics note that no ordinary
Soviet has the money or clout to look like her and mutter about a
woman meddling in what is seen as the men's business of politics.
   A Soviet official, speaking privately, admitted in May before
the Gorbachevs arrived in the Romanian capital of Bucharest that
``not everybody in our country agrees that she should be along.''
   But, he said, Gorbachev ``says it helps him to have her there.
Apparently, it helped a lot that she was in Reykjavik'' at the
Soviet leader's 1986 summit with President Reagan.
   In public, the Gorbachevs show their affection for each other by
exchanging glances and small asides.
   The couple, married in 1954 when both were students in Moscow,
held hands as they walked together up a long stairway leading to a
monument to the unknown soldier on a hill outside Belgrade Monday.
   And at a formal dinner Tuesday night, they twice leaned across
Yugoslav President Lazar Mojsov, seated between them, to chink
glasses and smile warmly at each other during formal toasts.

<HEAD>Illicit Meeting of Bulls and Cows Was `An Act of God,' Caretaker
Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It was ``an act of God'' that brought
two love-struck bulls together with the cows next door, says a man
accused of negligence for failing to keep them apart.
   The bulls were unexpectedly freed from their pen when a tree
limb felled by a storm crushed the fence enclosing them. They
headed for Maggie and Blackbird, two pure-bred cows awaiting
artificial insemination by a $770,000, prize-winning Angus bull
named Broadway.
   Since the bulls, aged 9 and 13 months, may have beaten
Broadway's time with the cows, the cows' owners were advised to
wait 60 to 90 days before artificial insemination, to make sure
Broadway was the father.
   Though this was done, the owners are suing Kirk Hardin,
caretaker of the bulls and cows, for $39,000, accusing him of
negligence in not keeping the guys and gals apart.
   Lonnie Pembrook, owner of Pembrook Cattle Co. near Fairview, and
Tom Young, a New Jersey businessman, each owned a half-interest in
Blackbird. Pembrook owns Maggie.
   Hardin, a specialist in artificial insemination and embryo
transfer techniques, contends the fence mishap, in the fall of
1986, was an ``act of God'' that could not have been prevented or
foreseen.
   The trial began Monday before a Payne County jury, and testimony
ended Tuesday. Closing arguments are scheduled Friday.
   After the artificial insemination took place, the embryos were
frozen, according to testimony. Pembrook picked up the frozen
embryos in October, but there was no testimony on whether the
embryos had since been placed in host cows.

   Being dead for 2,500 years deserves a lot of
respect. Just ask Ed Rodley.
   Rodley, staff assistant at the Boston Museum of Science,
organized the move Tuesday of an Egyptian mummy from its permanent
residence at the Massachusetts General Hospital to the museum for
its Ramses the Great exhibit next month.
   ``It's probably the most worrisome thing I've moved,'' said
Rodley. ``It's a mummy. It was a person. If you drop a vase, that's
one thing. If you drop a dead Egyptian and his head falls off,
that's another.''
   That head was blackened from embalming fluids. But the man's
white teeth shone in a resolute grimace.
   The 2,500-year-old body of Padihershef had been refurbished only
three years ago. Centuries of dust came off, the teeth were cleaned
and steamed, the bandages rewrapped, his body-length lacework of
blue porcelain beads cleaned and restrung and his head, which had
become dislodged, was glued on straight.
   Rodley said the most precarious part of the hour-long move was
the six-minute, 1,500-yard journey over city streets by moving van.
But it was accomplished without mishap, the stonecutter's body
resting silently in yellow plastic bubble stretcher designed for
moving victims of nuclear accidents.

<HEAD>New Soviet Doctrine a Signal of Economic Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An emerging new Soviet military
doctrine appears to signal Kremlin realization that it cannot
compete in a full-blown arms race and still carry out much needed
economic reforms.
   As the Soviets debate possible force reductions, their diplomats
are trying to persuade the West to scale back through arms control
agreements.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, meeting in Bern with his
Soviet counterpart Dmitri Yazov, says he wants Yazov to explain
whether the new ``reasonable sufficiency'' doctrine will mean fewer
tanks, artillery and missiles facing the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Yazov and other Soviet generals are billing the new doctrine as
defensive, but Carlucci says their formulation appears to require
continued high levels of offensive capabilities.
   U.S. analysts say Soviet force reductions may not occur until
the United States and Soviet Union reach an agreement on cuts in
conventional forces.
   Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a speech in Budapest in
1986, proposed major conventional cuts, and the two sides are
negotiating, but no agreement has been reached.
   NATO leaders last month urged the Kremlin-led Warsaw Pact to cut
its tank and infantry forces to the same level as NATO. Western
analysts say the Soviet bloc has a 2-1 edge.
   Many U.S. analysts, however, doubt the Kremlin intends to reduce
its forces, and Carlucci told reporters Tuesday, ``If anything,
their military continues to grow. They continue to modernize.''
   Harriet Fast Scott, the author of books and articles on the
Soviet armed forces, said of the new doctrine, ``Reasonable
sufficiency is whatever you want it to mean. It satisfies both the
hawks and the doves, at home and abroad.''
   Another U.S. scholar, James M. McConnell of the Center for Naval
Analysis near Washingon, says ``the important part of reasonable
sufficiency is the arms control part.''
   McConnell, in a paper on the doctrine, said Kremlin leaders are
``saying, in effect: To secure growth and greater national security
in the long haul, the U.S.S.R. must renounce some of its current
military ambitions.''
   The Kremlin must be thinking that ``unilateral steps along this
road, however, will only put the Soviet Union at the mercy of the
West. `We must bargain now while the U.S.S.R. is still ahead, and
see to it that NATO disarmament proceeds pari passu (in pace) with
out own,' '' wrote McConnell.
   Part of the Western confusion over the doctrine stems from
differing views offered by Soviet academics.
   Gen.-Col. M.A. Gareyev, deputy chief of the Soviet General
Staff, said last year that ``the Soviet Union is in favor of
restricting military potentials within the bounds of reasonable
sufficiency, so that the armed forces will be able structurally to
conduct only defensive operations.''
   Another Red Army officer, Col. Lev Semeiko, who comments
frequently in the press, called the Soviet formulation ``truly
revolutionary, since for the first time it proposed the mutual
rejection by the two sides of such a type of military action as the
offense, traditionally considered basic.''
   As recently as 1986, McConnell wrote, the Desk Military
Encyclopedia of the Soviet Union dismissed such a defensive posture
as only ``expedient when confronted with a superior military
opponent, or when it was necessary to economize forces ... to
accumulate a preponderance of forces for an offensive.''
   Another Soviet military officer who writes frequently on
doctrine, Col. V. Larionov, said last year that ``defense is the
more economical method of action,'' signaling that economic, rather
than purely propagandistic, motives are driving the doctrine of
``reasonable sufficiency.''
   U.S. officials argue that cutting nuclear weapons saves little
money, and that sharp reductions in conventional armies are needed
to free up money for the civilian economy.
   Carlucci reinforced that point at a dinner with Yazov on Tuesday
night, telling him that nuclear arms control ``doesn't save money.
It costs money. We are spending $198 million'' for on-site
inspections to verify elimination of medium-range nuclear missiles.

   The ballots give little indication
who is running and what is at stake in Sunday's Democratic and
Republican presidential primaries in this U.S. commonwealth.
   Democratic ballots show the familiar, smiling faces of ex-Gov.
Carlos Romero Barcelo and Senate President Miguel Hernandez Agosto.
Candidates themselves are represented by symbols _ a hockey puck
for Paul Simon, an egg for Richard Gephardt.
   Bob Dole is pictured on Republican ballots along with George
Bush and a blank space for voters who want to write in the name of
Pat Robertson. Only Bush's picture matters. Robertson never was a
factor and Dole's delegates quit two weeks ago and tried to call
off the primary.
   ``No one else but George Bush has a chance,'' party chairman
Luis Ferre says.
   Puerto Ricans care who sits in the White House, and understand
that their 14 GOP and 51 Democratic National Convention votes, if
cast for the winner, may result in more high-level appointments and
favorable treatment on food stamps, low-income housing and other
issues important to the island.
   But what really is at stake Sunday is control of the local
Democratic party, currently split between the Popular Democratic
Party and the out-of-power New Progressive Party.
   The primary also is a sort of referendum on the island's
political status, and a test of strength between Gov. Rafael
Hernandez Colon and Romero Barcelo, a two-time ex governor who
would like to return to the Fortaleza, Puerto Rico's White House.
   The NPP wants Puerto Rico to become the 51st U.S. state. The PDP
favors a continuation of the status quo, whereby Puerto Ricans are
U.S. citizens with most every right and obligation except they
cannot vote for president and pay no federal taxes.
   Thus, votes for Romero Barcelo indicate a preference for
statehood, and strengthen his hand against rivals within the NPP,
including San Juan Mayor Baltasar Corrada del Rio, also a
gubernatorial candidate. Votes for Hernandez Agosto endorse some
form of political autonomy, and PDP Gov. Hernandez Colon.
   ``Everyone here knows _ and anyone in the United States that
knows Puerto Rico politics knows _ that what's cooking ... is a
confrontation between the PDP and the NPP, and not a primary of the
Democratic parties,'' Jose Dapena Thompson, the NPP mayor of Ponce,
said.
   The contests have been heavily publicized, with both sides
organizing rallies and long car calvacades, horns tooting and
loudspeakers blaring, in urban housing projects and mountain
villages across this lush island.
   Romero Barcelo and Hernandez Agosto are regular guests on TV and
radio talk shows, and San Juan's four newspapers prominently
feature stories like NPP allegations of faulty voter lists and PDP
fears about double-voting.
   One million Puerto Ricans are expected to vote Sunday. The
Democratic National Committee is sending a commission to monitor
its primary, citing past ``instances of Puerto Rican voters casting
votes in both party's primaries.''
   Bush won the 1980 primary. The Republican Party has stated in
its platform for more than a decade that it supports statehood for
this U.S. territory of 3.5 million located 1,000 miles southeast of
Florida.
   The island's 51 Democratic pledged delegates will be uncommitted
to any presidential candidate. There is a separate ``beauty
contest'' balloting that has drawn several of the Democrats to the
territory in search of, literally, a symbolic win _ the candidates
were assigned symbols by lot to distinguish them on the ballot.
Jesse Jackson, a square, and Sen. Albert Gore Jr., a triangle, are
scheduled to visit Friday.

   The Soviet Union on Wednesday named a former
Moscow Communist Party chief and ambassador to Denmark to replace
the envoy in Afghanistan, who a Western diplomat said had suffered
a heart attack.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said Nikolai G. Yegorychev had
been chosen ambassador to Kabul to replace Pavel P. Mozhayev, who
had held the job since August 1986.
   The news agency Tass said Yegorychev, who was born in 1920, has
been a party worker since 1950, and from 1962-67 was head of the
Moscow party organization. Since then he served in several
agricultural ministries, as ambassador to Denmark for 14 years and
an official of the Soviet Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
   Yegorychev was replaced as Moscow party chief by Viktor Grishin,
who served until he was ousted by Gorbachev in December 1985.
   Grishin, who some thought wasthe main alternative to Gorbachev
when the Soviet leader was chosen in March 1985, has been accused
of permitting widespread corruption in the Moscow party
organization.
   Izvestia said Mozhayev, 57, had been transferred to other,
unspecified work.
   The Western diplomat said Mozhayev had suffered a heart attack
about a month ago, and that his replacement was not unexpected nor
necessarily politically significant.

<HEAD>School Bans Stage Play Because Of Nude Scene</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORANGE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Administrators at a private Christian
college say they will bring the curtain down on a student's play
unless he cuts a nude scene from the final act.
   Joel Moffett, 21, learned Tuesday that administrators at Chapman
College have banned performances of the ``The Coloring Box,'' which
he wrote and directed, unless he removes a that calls for a man and
woman to walk on stage naked and wash each other's feet.
   Officials at the 2,000-student college, affiliated with the
Disciples of Christ Church, said they were concerned that the
scene, which had been approved by the school's communications
department, would give the school a bad image.
   ``We recognize diversity of opinion and we support freedom of
speech and creative expression, but on occasion the nature of
certain performances on campus must be reviewed,'' said school
spokesman Jerry Derloshon.
   Moffett, supported by a student arts group, said he plans a
demonstration Monday to lobby administrators into a change of heart.
   ``It goes beyond the nude scene,'' the senior theater arts major
said in a recent interview.``What the college is doing is placing
their morals above Constitution-protected rights. It's hypocritical
to allow nudity in student art classes but not in theater arts.''
   The 75-minute play, Moffett said, centers on four people who
reject social pressure and begin living their lives for themselves.
The nude scene was written to symbolize their rebirth, he said.
   Greg Hobson, one of several faculty members who approved the
nude scene earlier, said the decision sends students the wrong
message.
   ``Now the nudity has become the issue rather than the writer's
development,'' Hobson continued. ``That's what really bothers me,
this idea that it's a dirty play. It's such a narrow viewpoint.''

   Galveston's beaches will soon change
color _ from brown to white _ with the help of sand imported from
Florida.
   For years, people have complained about Galveston's murky water
and brown, narrow beaches, said Ralph McPheeters, administrator of
a development called Palm Beach at Moody Gardens.
   ``What do most people think of when they think of beaches?'' he
asked Tuesday. ``White sands.''
   ``We can't do anything about the water but we sure can do
something about the sand,'' he said.
   Within two weeks, he said, two ocean barges full of white sand
are expected from Orlando, Fla., he said. The sand, purchased from
Orlando sand mines, was selected because it has the right
consistency and color for building sand castles, he added.
   Mayor Jan Coggeshell said the white beach would be a welcome
addition.
   The development is the latest part of a multimillion-dollar
project on the shores of Offatts Bayou. It will accommodate 3,000
people and include a 1,000-foot waterfront boardwalk and two huge
freshwater lagoons complete with a 12-foot waterfall and white sand
bottom.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo signed legislation
Wednesday to switch the date of the New York state primary to keep
it from falling on the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana.
   The primary, not to be confused with New York's April 19
presidential primary, will be held Thursday, Sept. 15. It was
originally scheduled two days earlier.
   Three other states had switched their primaries already to
prevent the conflict. Connecticut and Rhode Island will hold their
primaries Sept. 14, while Massachusetts will join New York with a
primary Sept. 15.
   Six states _ Arizona, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Utah, Vermont
and Wisconsin _ will hold primaries on Rosh Hashana, Sept. 13.
   In New York, Jews usually represent 20 percent or more of the
vote in Democratic primary contests.
   The state primaries determine nominations for governor, state
legislative seats, Congress and local offices.

   Four Arabs were reported killed Wednesday,
bringing the total to 100 since battles with Israeli soldiers began
in the occupied lands Dec. 8, and Palestinians shut their cities
and towns in a general strike.
   The strike was a message to U.S. and Israeli leaders that the
Palestine Liberation Organization must have a role in peace talks.
The PLO had ordered it in a leaflet, saying the purpose was to show
there is ``no alternative to an independent state led by the PLO,
our sole representative.''
   President Reagan said after meeting in Washington with Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel that he would not revise or
abandon the U.S. plan for Middle East peace talks.
   Shamir expressed ``strong reservations'' about some aspects of
the plan. It does not envision PLO participation.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin defended sanctions on Arabs in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. He said cutting telephone lines,
banning travel and imposing curfews prevent activists from
preparing attacks on Israelis.
   Guerrillas in Lebanon fired several rockets into northern
Israel, causing slight damage in one community, the army said.
   The settlement's name was withheld for security reasons but its
secretary, Zvi Zmora, said on Israel radio some residents were
alarmed by ``a feeling of gradual escalation'' in attacks from
Lebanon.
   Police detained an Arab-American advocate of non-violent
resistance and Israeli officials said he might be expelled. They
said Mubarak Awad, 44, was accused of attending an illegal
gathering.
   Riots swept the West Bank city of Tulkarm and two nearby refugee
camps 40 miles northwest of Jerusalem, the army and the Arab-run
Palestine Press Service said.
   Hundreds of Palestinians built roadblocks, set tires ablaze and
hurled stones at soldiers, who responded with tear gas, rubber
bullets and live ammunition.
   The army reported seven Palestinians wounded and two dead near
Tulkarm but the press agency said there were three dead. It
identified them as Salim al Yehyeh, 60, who died after soldiers
threw tear gas into his home, and Ashraf Mahmoud Ibrahim, 15, and
Hisham Daoud Alush, 23, both killed by gunfire.
   Army spokesmen confirmed the deaths of Yehyeh and Alush and said
the circumstances were being investigated. They said the report of
a third death was being checked.
   Soldiers shot 25-year-old Omar Yassin Hamarshi dead in Yabad, a
West bank village 50 miles north of Jerusalem, hospital officials
in nearby Jenin reported. The army confirmed the death and said it
was investigating.
   Fourteen other Palestinians were wounded in the West Bank and
Gaza, hospital officials told The Associated Press.
   According to U.N. figures, at least 100 Palestinians have been
killed in more than three months of ``the uprising,'' as the Arabs
now call the violence, nearly all of them by Israeli bullets or
beatings.
   The general strike paralyzed the occupied territories for the
second day. Stores were closed, public transport stopped and most
of the 110,000 Arabs who work in Israel stayed home. Palestinian
flags, which Israel has declared illegal, fiew from utility poles.
   Israel closed the Hebron Bus Co., which serves about 100,000
Palestinians, until next week. Army officials said it violated a
contract with Israel's military government that forbids striking.
   Rabin told a high school audience in Jerusalem the nightly 10
p.m.-3 a.m. curfews in the Gaza Strip were needed to ``reduce their
(Arab activists') capability to move by night, to prepare
explosives ... to obstruct roads that carry workers to Israel.''
   The Israelis have cut telephone lines connecting the occupied
territories to foreign countries, forbidden travel and kept
gasoline supplies from reaching the West Bank.
   ``We will use fuller and more sweeping measures to create an
atmosphere encouraging the silent majority to restrain the
extremists,'' he said.
   Awad, a Palestinian with homes in Jerusalem and Ohio, is accused
of attending an illegal gathering on the main road between
Jerusalem and Nablus in the West Bank, police spokesman Rafi Levy
said. He had no further details.
   Jonathan Kuttab, Awad's lawyer, said his client was questioned
about taking two foreign television crews to a women's sit-in in
Isawiya, an Arab village incorporated into Jerusalem after the 1967
war.

   President Reagan vowed today not to revise or
abandon the U.S. plan for Mideast peace talks in the face of
opposition from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   As they parted after a two-hour White House session, a deadlock
was apparent. Shamir registered his ``strong reservations'' to an
international conference demanded by King Hussein of Jordan with
U.S. support.
   The Israeli leader urged Reagan to modify the U.S. plan. Shamir
said he was willing to hold direct negotiations with Jordan under
U.S. and Soviet auspices. Or, Shamir said, ``I shall be ready to
consider a similar proposal.''
   But Reagan, speaking first in the East Room, said ``the United
States will not slice this initiative apart and not abandon it.''
He advised Shamir that there was ``a sense of urgency'' behind the
U.S. intiative to hold the peace conference next month.
   Reagan said those parties who do not agree to hold negotiations
``need to answer to themselves and their people.'' At the same
time, he said Shamir had not directly rejected the U.S. proposal,
which also calls for negotiations on an overall settlement by
December.
   ``There was essentially no slamming of the door on the Israeli
side,'' a senior U.S. official told reporters afterward.
   As Shamir's talks here wind down _ he leaves Thursday _ the
official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said,
``We are where we expected to be.''
   But he also threw cold water on Shamir's offer to negotiate with
Jordan under U.S. and Soviet auspices. The proposal was made by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz last October on a trip to the
Middle East and subsequently rejected by King Hussein.
   ``Standing on its own, there would not be much point point in
presenting that again,'' the official said.
   Despite their disagreement, Reagan again offered assurances to
Israel, and a warning to its enemies, that ``no wedge will ever be
driven between us.''
   Earlier, Reagan and Shamir posed for pictures in the Oval
Office, sitting in wingback chairs in front of the fireplace. Asked
whether he was giving up on a peace plan in view of Israeli
resistance, Reagan replied, ``We have not yet had our meetings;
we're just beginning. We're going to, I think, have a discussion on
all these things.''
   On the eve of Shamir's visit, Reagan underscored the U.S. view
that Arab-Israeli negotiations would help both sides and are
urgently needed.
   ``When it comes to Israel, the United States is not a bargainer
or a broker,'' Reagan said in a speech Tuesday to a United Jewish
Appeal group. ``The United States is a friend and an ally.''
   The White House meeting came on the third day of Shamir's
four-day visit, marked so far by his opposition to the U.S. plan
for negotiations.
   It began with another call on Shultz at the State Department by
the Israeli prime minister. They will meet again on Thursday.
   His spokesman, Avi Pazner, summing up three hours of talks
Shamir held Tuesday with Shultz, said ``he did not give an answer.
He did not say yes, he did not say no.''
   But Pazner said Shultz's proposal to hold an international peace
conference next month was ``a sticking point that has to be
resolved if we are going to go ahead.''
   The Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip have been plagued
by protests in which 96 Palestinians have been killed in clashes
with Israeli forces in a little more than three months.
   The peace conference would set the stage for negotiations
starting May 1 between Israel and a mixed delegation of Jordanians
and Palestinians to set up Palestinian self-rule in the territories
for three years.
   In the second stage of Shultz's plan, negotiations on an overall
settlement of the 40-year Arab-Israeli conflict would begin by
December. There the United States would call on Israel to
relinquish at least some of the territories in exchange for Arab
recognition.
   Shultz acknowledged Tuesday he was unable to bridge differences
with Shamir. But he said ``we feel encouraged to continue our
efforts to work with Israel and others in the Middle East.''
   Shamir said that in Israel's view, the Middle East peace
conference could not play ``any positive role.''
   Pazner, the Israeli spokesman, claimed that King Hussein of
Jordan wants the conference to let Israel's enemies ``put pressure
on Israel, to try to bring Israel to agree to solutions it would
not agree to in free negotiations.''
   Shamir offered last October to hold Israeli-Jordanian
negotiations in Washington with U.S. and Soviet ``blessing.''
Pazner said Shamir stands by the offer even though it was rejected
by the king
   Reagan told the Jewish group ``we will not leave Israel alone to
stand alone.''
   ``Nor,'' the president said, ``will we acquiesce in any effort
to gang up on Israel. Peace will not be imposed by us or by anyone
else. It will and must come from the genuine give-and-take of
negotiations. That's what we're working to set in motion now.''
   Shultz had set this week as a ``deadline'' for a reply from
Israel and Jordan. In Amman, a senior Jordanian official told The
Associated Press that Jordan is still consulting with its Arab
neighbors on the proposal.
   On Capitol Hill, Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy
sought to reassure supporters of Israel that an international
conference would not dictate solutions to any side.
   Pressed by several congressmen on why Shultz had softened his
opposition to Soviet participation, Murphy said no Arab state would
enter peace talks without a Soviet presence. ``They're (the
Soviets) in the region, and we have to find a way to deal with
them,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, nine Republican senators made public the text of a
letter to Shultz urging him not to subject Shamir to U.S. criticism
or pressure.
   It said American support should not be used ``as a lever to
force Israel's leaders to adopt a policy which they see as
dangerous to the national security of their country _ especially
when such policy entails injecting the Soviet Union into the peace
process.''
   The letter was signed by Sens. Chic Hecht, R-Nev.; Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.; Steven Symms, R-Idaho; David Karnes, R-Neb.; William L.
Armstrong, R-Colo.; Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H.; Phil Gramm,
R-Texas; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; and Chris Bond, R-Mo.

   Pakistan's chief negotiator said Wednesday that
next week's visit to Washington by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze may help clear the roadblocks in the Afghanistan
peace talks.
   Zain Noorani said the superpowers may ``at least find it easier
to settle among themselves'' the issue of a simultaneous cutoff of
military aid to both warring sides.
   Shevardnadze is scheduled to be in Washington March 20-23 to
continue preparations for a superpower summit.
   The United States and Pakistan, which represents the Afghan
guerrillas in the peace talks, both are demanding that Moscow's aid
to its Kabul allies cease at the same time as the assistance _
mainly from Washington _ to the insurgents fighting the
Soviet-backed government.
   Moscow and Afghanistan have rejected this as interference in
their domestic affairs and said the Soviet aid to Afghanistan
cannot be compared to foreign aid to insurgents.
   Noorani told reporters the aid cutoff was one of Pakistan's two
main concerns that should be resolved before the signing of a peace
settlement.
   Pakistan's other main concern is the establishment of a new
Afghan government to oversee implementation of a settlement and
ensure the safe return of more than 5 million Afghan refugees.
   For the first time, Noorani spelled out in detail Pakistan's
idea for resolving the issue, saying Pakistan agreed with the
Soviet Union and ``everyone else'' that the future government was a
matter to be settled by the Afghans.
   But he said the Afghans should be given a ``helping hand'' in
forming it.
   Noorani said Pakistan envisaged a conference of all Afghan
parties, ``including representatives of the present regime ... in
Geneva or Vienna or anywhere else,'' at an unspecified date.
   He said the conference could best be coordinated by U.N.
Undersecretary General Diego Cordovez, the intermediary between
Afghanistan and Pakistan in the nearly 6-year-old peace talks.
   Noorani said Pakistan was prepared to stay in Geneva ``as long
as it takes to conclude the accords making up the peace
settlement.''
   Earlier, the head of the Afghan delegation, Foreign Minister
Abdul Wakil, gave a similar pledge. He said Afghanistan ``sees no
reason for a suspension of the talks.''
   New sessions were scheduled Thursday, the second day after a
Soviet-set target date for the conclusion of talks.
   The Soviets have offered fresh assurances, however, that they
will still remove an estimated 115,000 troops two months after a
settlement is signed. Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in
1979.
   The two chief delegates resumed trading charges through the
media that the other side was stalling the negotiations. Wakil said
Islamabad is creating ``artificial obstacles'' and warned that
failure to reach a settlement might cause the war to spread to
Pakistan.
   Noorani said Wakil was paying ``mere lip service to peace and
harmony in Afghanistan.''
   In Moscow, U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock met Wednesday with
Shevardnadze and was warned that the Kremlin wants the United
States and Pakistan to stop ``artificially procrastinating'' on an
end to the war, the Tass news agency said.
   The news agency said the discussion between Shevardnadze and
Matlock dealt mostly with the Afghanistan issue.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert confirmed that Matlock
had a meeting with Shevardnadze that included a discussion on
Afghanistan, but said it is embassy policy not to disclose details
of diplomatic exchanges.

Court</HEAD>

   Horace Calvo doesn't have a law degree or even a
bachelor's, but he does have the Democratic nod for a seat on the
Illinois Supreme Court and the example set by another Illinoisan _
Abraham Lincoln.
   ``As a matter of fact, I believe (Lincoln) studied law by the
firelight,'' Calvo said Wednesday, a day after he won a four-way
Democratic primary race. ``The test, to me, seems to be what you
have done after school and passed the (bar) exam.''
   And Calvo says there's another counterpart who went far without
the kind of academic credentials now usually expected of anyone
presiding over a courtroom.
   ``Robert Jackson didn't have a law degree and he was a justice
on the U.S. Supreme Court in the '40s and 50s,'' Calvo said.
   Calvo said that like Lincoln, becoming a lawyer was not easy for
him.
   He attended St. Louis University and Lincoln College of Law in
Springfield, taking 1,200 hours of classes, but left both schools
without a diploma.
   ``I did it at night law school for four years, and I worked 40
hours a week and I had my family to support,'' Calvo recalled.
   The 61-year-old Glen Carbon jurist began practicing law in 1956
after passing the bar exam on his third try.
   Since 1967, state Supreme Court rules have required that
candidates for the bar have a law-school degree before taking the
test.
   Calvo has been a Madison County circuit judge since 1975 and
last fall was temporarily assigned by the Supreme Court to hear
cases on the Fifth District Appellate Court.
   Two of his rivals, Circuit Judge Robert Hill of Benton and East
St. Louis attorney Charles Kolker, made an issue of Calvo's
academic background.
   ``Getting less than a law degree is an indication of lack of
qualifications,'' Hill said.
   But Calvo dismissed the importance of his credentials for
representing the 37-county district from Southern Illinois.
   ``I think, perhaps, the people may have found out the lack of a
law degree was somewhat of a false issue,'' Calvo said.
   Lincoln himself, who never graduated from law school, once said
of a legal education: ``It is but a small matter whether you read
WITH anybody. Get the books and read and study them ... that is the
main thing.'' Reading the law with an established attorney, a sort
of apprenticeship, was an accepted form of legal training until
recent decades.
   With all the vote in, Calvo had 49,894 votes, or 33 percent;
Circuit Judge Carl Becker had 42,245, or 28 percent; Hill had
39,582, or 27 percent and East St. Louis attorney Charles Kolker
trailed with 17,428, or 12 percent.
   Calvo, who has the advantage of an overwhelmingly Democratic
district, will face Republican Thomas Welch, 48, of the appellate
court in Mount Vernon, in the November general election.
   Welch said he did not expect the academic credentials issue to
come up in the race for the $93,000-a-year job.
   The winner will succeed retired Justice Joseph Goldenhersh, who
resigned last September at age 73 due to poor health.
   The high court appointed Circuit Judge Joseph Cunningham, 63, of
Fairview Heights, as an interim justice to serve through December.
He did not seek a full 10-year term.

   A van ran off a dead-end road Wednesday
and plunged into a secluded bay in a wildlife refuge, drowning
three young sisters, state troopers said.
   The girls' mother, who was driving the van, crawled through
mudflats but was in shock and unable to tell rescuers about the
children. The woman, 29-year-old Aimee Dees, was reported in
guarded condition at University of South Alabama Medical Center.
   Baldwin County Coroner Huey Mack said the dead were Kristen
Mallory Dees, 2; Morgan Cameron Maxwell, 6; and Kari Malissa
Maxwell, 8.
   Authorities speculated that Mrs. Dees may have visited nearby
Gulf Shores, a popular resort area, and may have been returning to
her home north of Mobile.
   A group of people on the beach near the road were huddled around
a campfire shortly after midnight when they saw the van run into
Weeks Bay. They pulled Mrs. Dees from the muddy water, but didn't
know the children were still in the vehicle.
   Rescue workers worked in record 30-degree weather for three
hours before locating the vehicle in 32 feet of water. The
temperature was the lowest for March 16 since 1937, the National
Weather Service said.

   About 35 activists for the homeless were
evicted Wednesday from an abandoned house, while supporters ran up
side streets knocking over garbage cans and setting trash fires,
police said.
   One woman was arrested and several protesters scuffled with
police during the vandalism spree, which began at 6 a.m. as police
removed squatters occupying a house owned by the University of
California, officers said.
   The activists took over the house five blocks south of campus
about a week ago, breaking in through boarded windows, said
university spokesman Tom Debley. The university ordered the
eviction after the city fire marshal inspected the three-story
house Tuesday and declared it a fire hazard, he said.
   ``There were a few minor scuffles with police but the eviction
itself was peaceful,'' said Debley.
   The eviction was carried out by university police, with Berkeley
officers standing by. Within hours, bulldozers moved in to demolish
the building, which was to be torn down to make way for student
housing, Debley said.
   The university runs an 80-bed shelter for the homeless on campus
property, Debley said.
   Homeless activist Al Winslow, who lives in another building as a
squatter, said the group would take over another house. He
estimated 2,000 people live on the streets of Berkeley.
   The squatters, a mixture of homeless people and activists,
include some members of the 10th Street Housing Collective, which
staged a two-year occupation of an abandoned house owned by a bank,
said Nikki Rexroat, of Mayor Loni Hancock's office. The group was
evicted from that house two days before taking over the university
building, Rexroat said.
   The woman arrested was being held in the city jail for malicious
mischief, disturbing the police and interfering with a police
officer, police said.

   The White House said Wednesday it is weighing
all options ``short of invasion'' by U.S. military forces in
response to a reported new Nicaraguan incursion against Contra
rebel bases in Honduras.
   President Reagan's chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said
President Jose Azcona of Honduras had requested U.S. assistance to
deal with the invasion. Asked whether this included a plea for
military help, he replied, ``I can't say.''
   Fitzwater said Secretary of State George Shultz, national
security adviser Colin Powell and White House chief of staff Howard
H. Baker Jr., were dispatched to Capitol Hill to brief
congressional leaders. He said they would ``review a menu of
options and will probably make decisions after that.''
   Reagan, meantime, said ``obviously we're concerned'' about the
incursion reports _ confirmed by the Honduran ambassador to the
United States but neither confirmed nor denied by Nicaragua. But he
also sidestepped questions about possible use of U.S. military
forces.
   Fitzwater said both U.S. military and diplomatic moves were
being considered in response to the reports, which surfaced as the
administration made fresh appeals to Congress for continued aid to
the Contras in their battle against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government.
   Asked whether consideration was being given to using U.S. troops
in Central America, Reagan said, ``I can't comment on anything.''
He said only that officials had been ``in consultation'' with the
Honduran government.
   Fitzwater at first told reporters ``nothing is being ruled out
at this point.'' But he quickly revised that, saying: ``At this
moment everything is being considered, short of invasion.''
   During a picture-taking session in the Oval Office with visiting
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Reagan said ``the
information we have is that Nicaragua has crossed the border into
Honduras.''
   The president, who had held a series of strategy sessions with
key advisers, invited several congressional leaders to the White
House to discuss the situation, said sources who declined to be
identified.
   Fitzwater later told reporters that Reagan made ``some tentative
decisions about what the options are and what seems to be the most
reasonable course.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said, meantime, said he could
not immediately evaluate the incursion reports.
   ``If true, that would be a very serious matter and would
introduce an element of gravity that could profoundly alter the
situation,'' including the willingness of Congress to vote for
further aid of some kind for the rebels, Wright told reporters.
   But he said he still does not believe support exists in Congress
for any kind of renewed military aid for the rebels, and repeated
that congressional Democrats remain willing to talk about a further
package of purely ``humanitarian'' aid.
   The Honduran ambassador, Roberto Martinez, said there had been a
``penetration into Honduran territory of a number, ... definitely
in the thousands, of Sandinista troops. At this moment, we are
trying the utmost to obtain a clearing of the area, ... a total
withdrawal, immediate withdrawal, of the Sandinista troops from our
territory.''
   But he said his government hoped to avoid military action.
   In Managua, the Defense Ministry declined to confirm or deny
that its troops entered Honduran territory but acknowledged that a
major offensive was under way.
   ``We're looking into the reports,'' said an officer in the
ministry's public relations office who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``It's serious and that's why I can't say yes or no.''
   Another ministry source had denied the incursion reports Tuesday
night.
   Some 12,500 American military personnel are stationed in Central
America, including roughly 10,000 are located in Panama. Total U.S.
military manpower in Honduras varies from week to week, depending
upon the exercises being conducted.
   A headquarters unit in Honduras coordinates the exercises has
about 1,100 personnel assigned to it. Beyond that, there are about
950 National Guard and Army Reserve engineers working on training
exercises inside Honduras, far from the border area.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said he could not
be more precise about the number of Nicaraguan troops in Honduras
beyond ``on the order of thousands.''
   ``I hate to see unusual attention drawn to the fact of whether
the exact number is 4,000, 4,200, 4,700 or 5,300,'' he said. ``The
fact of the matter is, that we have a major Sandinista offensive
under way.
   ``It's been described as such by the Nicaraguan government on a
number of occasions now. Just yesterday, President (Daniel) Ortega
was talking about two major offensives.''
   Redman said that inside Nicaragua, the Sandinista forces are
using ``much superior firepower,'' including Soviet-supplied AN-26
aircraft, close support from artillery and rockets and MI-25 attack
helicopters.
   Besides the operation in the Bocay Valley there is a
``multi-batallion operation under way in the vicinity of Bonanza''
in Nicaragua, he said.
   Redman said the United States is committed to help Honduras
``preserve territorial sovereignty and national integrity. We're in
very close consultation with the government of Honduras.''
   Fitzwater did not spell out what options were being considered,
but he said ``the Organization of American States will be asked to
consider the issue, and the presidents of Guatemala, Costa Rica and
El Salvador will present their views.''

   The United States is looking into a published
report that the Nicaraguan government failed to deposit $11 million
it owed to the InterAmerican Development Bank after saying it had
done so.
   The bank accepted Nicaragua's word, reinstated the Central
American nation as a borrower in good standing and disbursed $11
million to Nicaragua from old loans that had been withheld,
according to the report in The Washington Times.
   ``The very next day the IDB received the bulk of the 11 million
which Nicaragua had supposedly deposited in IDB accounts six days
before,'' Rep. Jim Bunning told a congressional hearing Wednesday.
   David C. Mulford, assistant secretary of the Treasury for
international affairs, said his department had asked the bank for a
copy of its report on the incident, which allegedly occurred last
Nov. 11. The Times article appeared Jan. 5.
   ``I wasn't aware of that situation, which we refer to as
`round-tripping,' and it is something that is being looked into,''
Mulford told the House Banking subcommittee on international
development institutions.
   ``I would point out, however, that since that incident occurred,
Nicaragua again immediately fell into arrears and therefore is not
eligible to receive further disbursements,'' Mulford said.
   Later he added: ``The incident you mentioned ... does not appear
to be isolated just to Nicaragua. ... We understand that this type
of `round-tripping' is something that's been done by the bank from
time to time, and you can lay it down in a way to inadequate, not
tight enough management.''
   Mulford said the U.S. government is still refusing to make a new
contribution to the bank, which is owned by 44 governments, until
they agree to a new voting system that would enable the United
States and Canada to block loans they consider undesirable.
   Under the present system, borrowing countries control the votes.
The U.S. government also wants changes in management.
   The bank now plans to lend about $2.5 billion a year.

<HEAD>Bradley Says He'll Endorse Presidential Candidate Before June 7</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., told state
Democratic Party leaders Wednesday they should not pursue an
uncommitted slate of New Jersey delegates for the June 7
presidential primary.
   Bradley said he will endorse a presidential candidate before the
primary. While party officials said Bradley gave them the
impression he would endorse Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the
senator told reporters he has not yet made a decision.
   Emerging from a closed-door meeting with about 30 party leaders,
Bradley said he hopes the announcement of his choice for the
nomination would end speculation that he wants to be the party's
1988 nominee.
   ``It's like I've said from the beginning,'' Bradley said. ``This
is not the time for me. This should close the door on a Bradley
presidential bid.''
   Bradley previously had urged state party officials not to
endorse any candidate until after the Super Tuesday March 8
balloting around the country. Some Democrats tried to put together
an uncommitted slate in hopes they could throw their support to
Bradley at a brokered convention.
   State Committee Chairman Raymond Durkin said he thought Bradley
was leaning toward Dukakis.
   ``He (Dukakis) has a leg up here and the money that will last
until he gets to New Jersey,'' Durkin said. ``Dukakis has a pretty
good presence in New Jersey.''

<HEAD>Cisneros Turns Down Offer To Speak At Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mayor Henry Cisneros has turned down
an offer to speak at the Democratic National Convention but
Hispanic leaders want him to change his mind, an aide to Cisneros
said Wednesday.
   Cisneros rejected the offer by the Congresional Hispanic Caucus.
But Rep. Albert G. Bustamante, D-Texas, the caucus chairman, said
``we're still trying to get him to change his mind. Cisneros would
just be a natural'' to address the convention in Atlanta in July.
   Shirl Thomas, Cisneros' administrative assistant, said the
caucus was not taking ``no'' for an answer. ``He thought about it
for a long time and we talked about it frequently,'' Ms. Thomas
said. ``It is a very flattering thing to be asked to do and he did
not take it lightly at all.''
   She said Cisneros cited a busy schedule and family
considerations in his decision to reject the offer to speak at the
convention.

<HEAD>Orr Predicts Indiana Could Put Bush Over the Top</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indiana's May 3 primary could give Vice
President George Bush the delegates he needs to clinch the
Republican presidential nomination, Gov. Robert D. Orr said
Wednesday.
   Orr commented at a news conference where he was joined by
Indianapolis Mayor William H. Hudnut and other prominent
Republicans who support Bush.
   ``Bush is now on a roll, and Indiana is very likely the state
that will provide a majority of delegates for George Bush,'' said
Orr. ``We're trying to get the word out that George Bush is going
to be the Republican nominee.''
   Indiana will have 51 delegates at the GOP convention, with 30 of
them at stake in the primary.
   Among those joining Orr in expressing support for Bush were
state Republican Chairman Gordon K. Durnil and Marion County
Prosecutor Stephen Goldsmith. Durnil previously had been neutral in
the presidential race.

<HEAD>Doctor Who Faked Suicide Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRADFORD, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former surgeon who faked a suicide last
year after being charged with trying to strangle his estranged wife
is being held without bond after surrendering to authorities,
officials said Wednesday.
   David Johe, of Charleston, W.Va., surrendered to District
Justice Barbara Boser on Tuesday, authorities said. ``It came as
quite a surprise,'' she said.
   A preliminary hearing is scheduled April 19 for Johe, who
practiced at Bradford Hospital.
   Johe, 35, was arrested in June 1987 on attempted murder,
aggravated assault and trespassing charges after he allegedly
entered the home of his estranged wife, Blair Plott Johe, in
Bradford and tried to strangle her.
   Johe was released on $25,000 bond, then disappeared after
leaving two suicide notes _ one at his home in Ellicottville, N.Y.,
and the other in his van near Niagara Falls.
   The one found in the van last July said: ``Goodbye. I hope the
water is not too cold. I guess I'll never know. David.''
   His body was never found, however, and some authorities said
they never believed he died.
   A Bradford judge in December dismissed a motion that would have
declared Johe dead after Mrs. Johe reported receiving unsigned
Christmas cards and presents for her three children that she
believed were from her husband.
   Last week, Johe's father, Charleston architect Howard Johe,
confirmed that his son was alive and had called him recently.
   ``I believe he just got tired of running and decided to turn
himself in,'' said Bradford police Officer Bradley Mason.

<TEXT>
   The Air Force said Tuesday one of two AMRAAM
air-to-air missiles fired during a test last month missed its
target.
   The service, in a brief statement, said the test was conducted
Feb. 22 when an F-15 Eagle jet fighter fired two of the missiles
against two target drones flying over the White Sands Missile Range
in New Mexico.
   ``One scored a direct hit against its assigned target drone,''
the Air Force said. ``The other missile did not intercept its
target and analysis is continuing to determine the cause of the
miss.''
   The test brought to 45 the number of successful trials out of 54
missile firings conducted to date.
   The AMRAAM _ Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile _ is a
so-called ``smart'' missile that has been under development since
1981. It is designed to use its own small radar to home in on enemy
planes without having to be guided by a pilot.

<HEAD>White House Upbeat On Spanish Offer Of Asylum For Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House offered encouragement Tuesday
for Spain's offer of asylum for Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega and left open the possibility of not seeking his
extradition on drug-trafficking charges.
   President Reagan said ``we do want Noriega out of there and a
return to a civilian democratic government.'' Noriega has been
indicted on drug charges in the United States, and the
administration has imposed economic sanctions against Panama to
force his ouster.
   Spain has said it would be willing to receive Noriega provided
he asks for asylum and the United States does not seek his
extradition.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``we have looked with favor upon efforts by Spain and other
countries to help solve this problem, but that's as far as we're
willing to go.''
   He acknowledged that U.S. officials have held talks with their
counterparts in Spain, but he refused to talk about the question of
extradition. ``We simply aren't prepared to comment on those
specific points at this time,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We'll pursue the legal course. There are always a lot of
options that can be taken under those circumstances,'' Fitzwater
said. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said one option was a political decision not to seek extradition.
   Some officials see the waiving of extradition as a key to
encouraging a quick departure by Noriega.
   Reagan was asked about Noriega during a picture-taking session
in the Oval Office with congressional leaders.
   He said ``I'm not in a position to answer'' whether the United
States would allow Noriega to go to a third country without facing
extradition to the United States.
   However, Reagan said emphatically, ``We do want Noriega out of
there and a return to a civilian democratic government.''

<TEXT>
   Government radio today urged
Nicaraguans to be on alert for a U.S. invasion after the United
States said it was considering action against Nicaragua for
allegedly attacking Contra positions in Honduras.
   The director of state-run Voice of Nicaragua, Caros Jose
Guadamuz, put out a nationwide alert calling on the people to
``maintain in a state of alert in defense of the neighborhoods,
cooperatives, businesses, industries because we can't discount the
possibility that President Reagan will invade Nicaragua in defense
of his mercenaries.''
   He said there was ``a direct threat from the White House that we
have to take seriously.''
   The radio also said unidentified airplanes were flying over the
Atlantic Coastal city of Puerto Cabezas. It said the people were
``scared and expected a bomb.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today
the Reagan administration was considering ``everything ... short of
invasion'' after national security officials met to discuss what it
said was a Nicaraguan attack on Contra rebel positions in Honduras.
   On Tuesday, about 6,000 Nicaraguan soldiers used helicopters and
heavy artillery in a major offensive against Contra rebel forces.
   But the Defense Ministry today strongly denied its soldiers
penetrated Honduran territory.
   ``We have never invaded Honduras and we have never invaded any
neighboring country,'' said a ministry spokeswoman, Maj. Rosa
Pasos. ``So we totally deny those declarations made this morning by
the White House.''
   Fitzwater said the Nicaraguan moves amounted to a ``very serious
breach of regional borders.'' He said 1,500 Nicaraguan troops were
already inside Hondruas and that 4,500 more appeared to be in a
staging area to cross the border.
   Heavy fighting was reported throughout Nicaragua's 5th Military
Region, which includes Boaco, Chontales, Rio San Juan and Zelaya
South. The Contras said Sandinista troops had overrun some rebel
positions.
   The Defense Ministry said 35 Contra fighters, seven Sandinista
soldiers and one civilian had been killed in the fighting.
   A State Department official in Washington, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said on Tuesday that initial reports suggested the
Sandinistas hoped to deliver a ``knockout blow'' to the Contras.
   The Defense Ministry announced Tuesday that the offensive was
launched last Friday and intensified Monday and Tuesday.
   The drive occurred a week before the leftist Sandinistas were to
negotiate with the U.S.-supported rebels about a cease-fire in
their six-year war. Three days of talks scheduled to begin next
Monday in the small southern town of Sapoa, near the border with
Costa Rica.
   The U.S. House of Representatives defeated a $30 million aid
package for food and clothing for the rebels two weeks ago, just
after U.S. aid ran out. President Reagan opposed the package
because it did not contain military aid.
   In a White House meeting Tuesday, Reagan pleaded with
congressional leaders for a renewal of Contra aid, but met an icy
reception from Democrats.
   Congressional sources, declining to be identified, said Reagan
pounded the table and said, ``There are some people around this
table who don't seem to know who the bad guys are down there.''
   Nicaragua did not report the offensive until Tuesday evening,
when a Defense Ministry spokesman said it was under way but denied
Contra claims that Sandinista troops crossed into Honduras, where
the rebels have bases.
   ``The army has undertaken major offensive operations ... Reports
that the army has penetrated Honduras are not true,'' the spokesman
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. He cannot be
identified for security reasons.
   In December 1986, Honduran warplanes and artillery pounded
Sandinista troops who had penetrated Honduras to attack Contra
bases, and U.S. Army helicopters were brought in to ferry Honduran
infantrymen to the front.
   Honduras charged at the time that up to 2,500 Sandinista troops
had gone up to nine miles into Honduras before returning to
Nicaragua about a week later.
   Contra spokesmen in Washington and Miami claimed Tuesday that
Sandinista troops entered Honduras in the latest offensive in
pursuit of rebel forces.
   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, a Honduran armed forces spokesman,
said on Tuesday he had no information of Sandinista incursions into
his country. ``Nevertheless, tomorrow we will probably be able to
report on the situation.''
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras was watching developments
closely and a government team ``is monitoring reports on the
subject,'' a Honduran government source said on Tuesday in
Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. The source spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Contras' clandestine Liberation Radio, in a broadcast
monitored in Managua on Tuesday, claimed the Sandinista army was
carrying out ``genocidal bombardments'' in Chontales, dropping
500-and 1,000-pound bombs from helicopters. ``Many peasants had to
flee for fear of being torn to pieces,'' the radio said.
   Contra leaders said Sandinista forces were knocking the rebels
back. ``They have overrun certain of our positions,'' said Ernesto
Palazio, director of the Contras' Washington office.
   Sandinista military sources said the offensive involved about
6,000 troops and called it ``an important anti-insurgent
operation.''
   All sources spoke to the AP on condition they not be identified.

   The House gave final congressional approval
Tuesday to legislation authorizing prime federal parkland in
Washington for a national monument to the 5,000 black patriots who
served in the American Revolution.
   The voice vote by the House followed Senate approval of the bill
on Feb. 26.
   The House is expected to approve similar, Senate-backed
legislation Wednesday that would authorize a choice Washington site
for a national memorial to Americans who fought in the Korean War.
   Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J., said the Korean War memorial, to
be built on the mall that extends from the Lincoln Memorial to the
Capitol, will be ``a fitting and long-overdue monument to the
55,000 Amricans who lost their lives in a forgotten war.''
   Private sponsors say they have raised $2.5 million toward a goal
of $10 million for the Korean War memorial. The black patriots
monument, also expected to be built on the mall, will cost an
estimated $4 million.
   Both the black patriots and the Korean War monuments previously
were authorized by Congress, and will be built with private
donations.
   A 1986 law requires House and Senate approval of Interior
Secretary Donald Hodel's finding that the memorials deserve a
preferred Washington location because of their ``pre-eminent
historical and lasting significance to the nation.''
   The capital's prime monument area includes the National Mall,
the grassy parkland between the Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial;
the Ellipse, the circular park behind the White House; Lafayette
Park, West Potomac Park and the Capitol grounds.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Col. Jean-Claude Paul, who commands
the most feared army unit in Haiti, said Tuesday he is not involved
in drug smuggling and journalists are defaming him.
   A federal grand jury in Miami indicted Paul, 49, last Thursday.
It accused him of allowing his private airstrip near Port-au-Prince
to be used to smuggle drugs from Latin America to the United States.
   ``I deny everything in this affair,'' Paul said by telephone
from his office in the barracks of his 700-man Dessalines
Battalion, located just behind the presidential palace. ``I am a
Haitian in Haiti. This concerns the Americans, not me.''
   When asked about the indictment he denied owning or operating a
landing field.
   ``That's a lie,'' he said, and laughed. ``I have no landing
field. I'm not even an aviator.''
   Paul said he had not been officially informed of an indictment
and declared: ``It is the newspapers that are saying that.''
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jeffrey Lite said Monday that Ambassador
Brunson McKinley personally told President Leslie Manigat of the
indictment last week.
   Manigat, elected Jan. 17 in voting supervised by the army, has
made no public comment on the matter. A spokeswoman for the
Information Ministry said Monday the government had not received
official notification of the indictment.
   In the telephone interview, Paul said: ``There is a campaign of
denigration against me. Haitians, when they want to denigrate
somebody and can't do it in Haiti, go abroad to do it.''
   Haiti Progres and Haiti en Marche have printed banner headlines
and front-page stories in the last few weeks about Paul's alleged
involvement with drug trafficking. The opposition weekly papers are
based in the United States and printed there.
   Le Matin and Le Nouvelliste, the two Port-au-Prince dailies, and
all 14 radio stations except the Roman Catholic church's Radio
Soleil have refrained from reporting the indictment.
   One station manager said Paul threatened him with violence if he
broadcast the story.
   Western diplomats and a former army officer said it is general
knowledge that Paul operates a landing strip near Thomazeau, a
village northeast of Port-au-Prince near the Dominican border.
   Asked what he would do to defend himself against charges in the
Miami indictment, Paul said, ``Military regulations are very strict
concerning that. It is up to the corps, not me, to assume my
defense.''
   Soldiers from Paul's battalion, who reinforce Port-au-Prince
police, were blamed for most of the attacks on civilians during
anti-government protests last summer. At least 30 people were
killed and 200 injured.
   Dessalines soldiers also were accused of protecting and even
aiding thugs who roamed the streets of the capital on Nov. 29, the
day of an election managed by an independent commission, killing at
least 34 people and causing the election to be canceled.

   Charles Blitzer, president of the National

Washington, the center's trustees announced Tuesday.
   He will succeed James H. Billington, who became librarian of

   The Wilson Center was established by Congress in 1968 as the
nation's official memorial to the 28th president. It provides about
50 research fellowships each year to academics, journalists and
officials from the United States and other governments.
   Blitzer, as an official of the Smithsonian Institution, helped
shape the legislation which founded the center. He headed the
center's fellowship selection committee for almost a decade.
   He is a specialist in the history of political theory and taught
at Yale from 1950 to 1961. While there, he was elected twice to the
position of alderman in New Haven, Conn.

<TEXT>
   A computer expert has been sentenced for
a third time to 36 years in prison for poisoning his wife and
hiding her body in a freezer.
   Circuit Judge Nicholas Geeker refused Tuesday to back down from
his original sentence for Ed Everage although it has twice has been
rejected by the 1st District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee.
   The appeals court initially sent the case back to Geeker because
he had cited some improper justifications for exceeding sentencing
guidelines calling for a 12- to 17-year term. The second time he
made a procedural error.
   Defense lawyer Leo Thomas said Everage will appeal his sentence
again.
   Everage, 44, who has a doctorate in chemical engineering and did
computer-aided research for the Monsanto Co. in Pensacola, was
convicted of second-degree murder for killing his wife, Aileen, 40,
in 1984.
   Everage claimed his wife accidentally swallowed a cold capsule
he had filled with cyanide for his own intended suicide. He said he
hid the body in the unplugged freezer because he didn't think
anyone would believe him.
   Everage had reported his wife was missing, saying she had been
dispondent over their recent move back to Pensacola from Charlotte,
N.C.
   Geeker has cited the cover-up as justification for exceeding the
sentencing guidelines. Other reasons he initially listed, including
a belief that Everage was a danger to his two sons and himself,
were rejected by the higher court.
   Everage has remained in the Escambia County Jail since his 1985

saved Escambia taxpayers $250,000 by developing computer programs
for the jail and Sheriff's Department.

   Imposing federal efficiency standards on the
electrical devices that start fluorescent lights would save a
massive amount of electricity, the equivalent of the power created
by seven atomic plants, a congressman said Tuesday.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said a bill that he was introducing
would save 7,000 megawatts by the year 2000, nearly $11 billion in
energy costs. He also said the measure would save more than $21
billion in power plant construction that could be avoided with the
energy savings.
   ``The energy saved by these standards is equivalent to the
energy produced by 15 large coal power plants or seven nuclear
power plants,'' he said. Gejdenson said his estimates came from the
American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a non-profit
research group based in Washington.
   Gejdenson and Rep. Phil Sharp, D-Ind., chairman of the Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on energy and power, said the bill would
mandate energy efficiency standards for ballasts by amending the
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act passed last year. That
law sets standards for stoves, refrigerators and other major
appliances.
   Massachusetts, Connecticut, California, Florida and New York
have adopted similar measures on the state level. In Connecticut
alone, state officials estimate that consumers will save between
$223 million and $496 million by the end of the century, according
to Gejdenson.
   Most fluorescent lights use ballasts with an aluminum wire coil
and small iron cores. Under the proposed standards, producers would
have to use either copper wire and steel cores or solid state
circuitry. Both types are already available.
   The alternative ballasts are about twice the price of the
standard aluminum ballast, but they last twice as long.
   Sharp said the alternative ballasts would save 10 percent to 15
percent in electricity over the traditional aluminum ballasts.
There are more than 50 million ballasts sold annually, he said.
   Industry groups supported the legislation, saying it would
simplify their business by having one nationwide standard.
   Michael Stein, president of the Certified Ballast Manufacturers
Association, noted that the five states with their own standards
have differing laws, and that other states are considering their
own requirements.

   President Reagan said today that Nicaraguan
troops had attacked Contra rebel positions in neighboring Honduras
and his spokesman said the United States was considering
``everything ... short of invasion'' in response.
   The White House said the president of Honduras, Jose Azcona,
asked for American assistance in trying to repel the Nicaraguan
forces, but White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he could
not say whether that request included a plea for military help.
   The Honduran ambassador put the number of Nicaraguan troops in
his country as in the thousands, but Nicaragua today strongly
denied that its soldiers had entered Honduran territory.
   ``We have never invaded Honduras and we have never invaded any
neighboring country,'' said Maj. Rosa Pasos, a Nicaragua Defense
Ministry spokeswoman. ``So we totally deny those declarations made
this morning by the White House.''
   Reagan, asked whether he was considering any use of U.S.
military forces, replied, ``We've been in consultation with the
Honduran government but I can't comment on anything.''
   He said that ``the information we have is that Nicaragua has
crossed the border into Honduras. Obviously we're concerned.''
   Speaking separatel, the Honduran ambassador, Roberto Martinez,
said that here a had been a ``penetration into Honduran territory
of a number, ... definitely in the thousands, of Sandinista troops.
   ``At this moment, we are trying the utmost to obtain a clearing
of the area, ... a total withdrawal, immediate withdrawal, of the
Sandinista troops from our territory.''
   But he said his government hoped to avoid military action.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan, his
national security adviser, the secretary of state and others ``have
conferred at length in the last 24 hours concerning the Nicaraguan
invasion of Honduran territory.''
   Fitzwater did not spell out what options were being considered,
except he did say that ``the Organization of American States will
be asked to consider the issue, and the presidents of Guatemala,
Costa Rica and El Salvador, will present their views.''
   He said the administration no longer is thinking of working with
Congress on an aid package to simply provide the resistance forces
with food, medicine, and other supplies, but not arms.
   Fitzwater said that Secretary of State George Shultz, national
security adviser Colin Powell and White House chief of staff Howard
H. Baker Jr., were being dispatched to Capitol Hill to brief
congressional leaders. He said they would ``review a menu of
options and will probably make decisions after that.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright said he could not immediately evaluate
reports that Sandinista troops had crossed into Honduras.
   ``If true, that would be a very serious matter and would
introduce an element of gravity that could profoundly alter the
situation,'' including the willingness of Congress to vote for
further aid of some kind for the rebels, he told reporters.
   But Wright said he still does not believe support exists in
Congress for any kind of renewed military aid for the rebels, and
repeated that congressional Democrats remain willing to talk about
a further package of purely ``humanitarian'' aid.
   Fitzwater said that 1,500 Nicaraguan troops were inside Hondruas
and that an additional 4,500 appeared to be in a staging area to
cross the border.
   Fitzwater told reporters that ``all options are under
consideration. At this moment, everything is being considered short
of (U.S.) invasion.''
   Fitzwater commented one day after Reagan met with Democratic and
Republican congressional leaders. He failed to persuade the
Democratic leaders to get behind a new package of humanitarian aid
for the Contras.
   Congressional sources, declining to be named, said at the
meeting Reagan pounded the table and said, ``There are some people
around this table who don't seem to know who the bad guys are down
there.''
   Today, Fitzwater said, ``More than 1,500 Sandinista troops are
now inside Honduras, attacking freedom fighter camps in an effort
to destroy their remaining supplies.''
   He added:
   ``There are nearly 4,500 Sandinista forces with strong
helicopter support moving into the Bocay Valley, which is just
below the Honduran border. They've established a new base for this
operation ... .
   ``In the last several hours, the United States government has
been in contact with the presidents of the other three democratic
governments in the region,'' he said. ``We've had discussions
concerning their response to this incursion and its meaning for the
Guatemala peace plan.''
   ``The United States government today is examining its options,''
he said.
   When first word of the Sandinista operation came Monday night,
Democratic sources in Congress portrayed it as a Nicaraguan attempt
to strengthen their position in advance of cease-fire talks with
the Contras, scheduled to begin Monday.
   Today, one senior administration official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said the Sandinista drive appeared to be
aimed at a Contra camp complex and supply depot.
   If the depot is knocked out, ``there will be nothing left'' of
the Contra war effort, the source said.
   That official said that Contra commander Enrique Bermudez is in
the Bocay region and may be in ``serious trouble'' because he and
his forces are surrounded by Sandinista troops.
   Nicaragua did not report the offensive until Tuesday evening,
when a Defense Ministry spokesman said it was under way but denied
Contra claims that Sandinista troops crossed into Honduras, where
the rebels have bases.
   ``The army has undertaken major offensive operations. ...
Reports that the army has penetrated Honduras are not true,'' the
spokesman said.
   Today, however, another official of the Defense Ministry would
neither confirm nor deny that its troops had invaded Honduras.
   ``We're looking into the reports,` an officer said. ``It's
serious and that's why I can't say yes or no.'' Both Nicaraguans
would not be identified.
   The Honduran Defense Ministry said that 43 people had been
killed in the Sandinista initiative.
   Heavy fighting was reported throughout Nicaragua's 5th Military
Region, which includes Boaco, Chontales, Rio San Juan and Zelaya
South. The Contras said Sandinista troops had overrun some rebel
positions.
   Fitzwater was peppered with questions about whether the
administration was considering any use of U.S. military forces
stationed in Honduras and in nearby areas.
   ``The president has said many times that he does not plan to
introduce invasion forces in Central America,'' Fitzwater said.
``We have said in the past, and it still holds true, that we do not
plan to invade. ... That certainly hasn't changed.''
   But Fitzwater also said, ``At this moment, everything is being
considered, short of invasion.'' But later he said ``nothing is
ruled out at this point.''
   ``I'm trying to be as restrained as possible,'' the spokesman
said under intense questioning about U.S. military intentions.
``I'm telling you not to draw that signal (of direct U.S. military
involvement), but we're in the midst of discussions.''
   Fitzwater said that administration officials had consulted by
telephone late Tuesday with congressional leaders and their
representatives.

<HEAD>Reagan Stands Firm on Peace Plan Despite Shamir Complaints</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Wednesday he will not
revise or abandon an American plan for Mideast peace talks even
though Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir complained that it was
``not conducive to peace.''
   Ending two hours of talks with Shamir in apparent deadlock,
Reagan warned that opponents of the U.S. proposal face certain
consequences.
   ``They'll need to answer to themselves and their people as to
why they've turned down a realistic and sensible plan to achieve
negotiations,'' the president said, standing alongside an unsmiling
Shamir during a White House departure ceremony.
   Reagan said Shamir did not specifically say ``no'' to an
international peace conference demanded by Jordan's King Hussein
with U.S. support.
   However, Shamir made clear that he rejected the idea. ``I have
strong reservations concerning the proposed international
conference, which in my view is not conducive to peace,'' he told
reporters.
   Shamir last October accepted a proposal by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz to hold direct talks with Jordan under U.S. and
Soviet auspices. ``I shall be ready to consider a similar
proposal,'' he told Reagan.
   However, Hussein has rejected the idea, holding out for a
full-scale international conference, and a senior U.S. official
said: ``Standing by itself, there would not be much point in
presenting that again.''
   The official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said
Reagan and Shamir dealt almost exclusively with differences over
the international conference.
   He said they did not review Israel's concerns about the U.S.
proposal that it cede at least part of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
it has held since the 1967 Six-Day War in exchange for recognition
by Arab nations.
   Shamir will wrap up four days of talks Thursday with another
meeting with Shultz. ``We are where we expected to be,'' the U.S.
official said, since Shamir did not come to Washington with a
decision by the Israeli Cabinet on the U.S. plan.
   Shultz had hoped to convene the peace conference next month and
to open negotiations May 1. He asked for a prompt reply from Israel
and the Arabs. ``We are not setting our watches on any of them,''
the senior official said.
   But he stressed the need to make arrangements rapidly.
   At the departure ceremony in the East Room, Reagan promised to
work to strengthen U.S.-Israeli ties during his final months in
office.
   Without specifically mentioning the three months of Palestinian
rioting and the Israeli crackdown in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, he said the talks focused on the search for peace in
the Middle East.
   ``We've seen a new sense of urgency on the part of many in the
region, and a wide recognition of the reality that the status quo
is unacceptable,'' the president said.
   He said ``the present situation is a challenge and an
opportunity to move decisively to break the deadlock that has
lasted far too long. I hope we will not lose this opportunity.''
   Reagan said the U.S. plan ``offers a realistic and achievable
way to change the relationship between Israel and the Arabs. ... So
let's be clear about several things: the United States will not
slice this initiative apart and will not abandon it.''
   Explaining Reagan's stand later, the senior U.S. official said,
``You start pulling it apart, it's not going to be workable.''
   While rejecting the notion of an international conference,
Shamir said, ``Israel firmly believes that those who are prepared
to live with each other in peace must learn to negotiate directly
with each other.''
   The U.S. official tried to put a positive face on the talks. He
said ``there was essentially no slamming of the door'' by Israel
and that the tone of the talks was excellent.
   Despite the apparent impasse, the president sought to reassure
the hesitant Israeli leader that the United States would not allow
terms to be dictated at a peace conference and shared Shamir's
distrust of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The official paraphrased Reagan as saying that peace cannot be
made under violence and terrorism.
   ``He said the PLO is revealing its real intent: no to peace and
yes to violence. We must find ways to give moderate Palestinians
and other Arabs a stake in the process.''

<HEAD>Former Mayor Jane Byrne May Quit Politics after Third Straight
Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Mayor Jane Byrne kicked in the door of
Chicago's fabled backroom politics nearly a decade ago, unsmiling
and unafraid of mixing it up with the Democratic machine's big boys.
   But after her third straight electoral setback, this one for
clerk of the Cook County Circuit Court and viewed by many political
observers as the first step in a comeback bid, Mrs. Byrne
apparently is calling it quits.
   ``When we say the people spoke,'' Mrs. Byrne said of Tuesday's
primary defeat, ``they apparently shouted.
   ``And therefore,'' she added, ``I'm very good at taking hints.''
   Mrs. Byrne declined to be interviewed Wednesday, when she
departed Chicago for Phoenix, Ariz., and ``some rest and
relaxation,'' said Joe Pecor, her campaign manager.
   But asked whether Mrs. Byrne does not intend to run again under
any circumstances, Pecor replied, ``Where she is concerned, one
should never say `never.'
   ``She has demonstrated time and again that she has a very solid
core of support running somewhere between 35 (percent) and 40
percent of the Democrats in Chicago and the county.''
   But that wasn't enough to stave off the late Harold Washington's
upset bid in the three-way 1983 Democratic mayoral primary, and it
wasn't enough when she tried to avenge that loss against Washington
last year.
   It turned out be too little again Tuesday when she lost to
Aurelia Pucinski, endorsed by the party organization that Mrs.
Byrne once held, vise-like, in her grip.
   And this latest loss came in a race rich with resonance and
names _ Pucinski, Byrne and Edward ``Fast Eddie'' Vrdolyak _ that
speak to the past, present and perhaps even the future of Cook
County's quirky Democratic politics.
   Mrs. Byrne, a former debutante with a flair for the dramatic,
became the city's first woman mayor in 1979, scoring a
rags-to-riches victory after campaigning against the political
machine of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley.
   She defeated the machine's candidate, then-Mayor Michael
Bilandic, with the help of much of the city's machine-weary blacks,
but later made peace with the regular Democrats.
   Included in that group were several aldermen Mrs. Byrne had
railed against as members of ``an evil cabal,'' most notably
Vrdolyak and Roman Pucinski, Aurelia Pucinski's father and one of
the machine's most loyal servants.
   But she paid dearly for cozying up to the old guard, as well as
for several other moves _ replacing blacks with whites on the
school board, then handing out hams at public-housing projects as
the 1983 election neared.
   Washington, galvanizing the black vote, turned her out of office
and became the city's first black mayor.
   He spent the next four years retooling the party machinery to
fit his needs, then became the first two-term mayor since Daley by
handily beating back successive challenges from Mrs. Byrne last
February in the primary and then Vrdolyak, running as a third-party
candidate, in April.
   After Washington's death in November, Alderman Eugene Sawyer
became mayor.
   Vrdolyak, saying the party under Washington had become
untenable, completed his move away from the Democratic organization
last year. Running as a Republican, he was unopposed in Tuesday's
primary for court clerk.
   In the meantime, Ms. Pucinski, an attorney and Metropolitan
Sanitary District commissioner, stepped out of her father's shadow
and was welcomed into the Washington camp.
   So much so that she may have beaten Byrne in Tuesday's race on
the strength of her showing among Chicago's blacks, who helped
propel her to a 52 percent to 38 percent victory over Mrs. Byrne
with nearly all the votes counted. Two other candidates, Thomas
Fuller, and Janice Hart, a follower of political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche, split the rest of the vote.
   Ms. Hart defeated Ms. Pucinski in the 1986 Democratic primary
for the Illinois secretary of state's office, won that November by
Republican Jim Edgar.
   Byrne's defeat spoiled an anticipated Byrne-Vrdolyak struggle in
the fall, a match of two former titans for an obscure office both
hoped would lead to bigger things.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Grows By 8.9 Percent In February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The housing industry, after staggering for two
months following the October stock market crash, enjoyed a sharp
8.9 percent increase in construction activity in February, the
biggest gain in more than a year, the government reported Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said the increase pushed construction of
single-family homes and apartments up to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.49 million units last month following declines of
15.8 percent in December and 1.9 percent in January.
   Those back-to-back setbacks, coupled with three consecutive
monthly declines in new home sales, had raised concerns because
housing is often the first industry to weaken at the onset of a new
recession. Economists feared that potential home buyers had grown
wary following the record collapse of the stock market in October.
   But the February upturn in construction starts was seen as an
encouraging sign that while housing activity will be slower this
year, it will not weaken so much that it threatens overall economic
growth.
   ``Housing is on the rebound,'' said Warren Lasko, executive vice
president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. ``With interest
rates at low levels and the economy growing and no recession in
sight, we think we have all the ingredients in place to generate a
strong spring building season.''
   In another upbeat report, the Federal Reserve said that output
at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percent in
February, leaving industrial activity 5.8 percent higher than it
was a year ago.
   Analysts said the increase, although much slower than the gains
made at the end of last year, confirmed their belief that the
manufacturing sector, aided by strong export demand, would provide
much of the strength in the economy this year.
   ``The industrial production figures depict an economy that is
growing less rapidly but really looks pretty healthy,'' said Jerry
Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   The declines in housing starts in December and January had
pushed building activity to its lowest point since the end of the
last recession in December 1982. Even with the February increase,
the pace of building is still 17.4 percent below where it was a
year ago.
   However, economists predicted that construction activity would
climb even more in future months as sales bounce back in response
to lower mortgage rates.
   Fixed-rate mortgages, which have risen slightly in recent weeks,
are still below 10 percent, standing at 9.96 percent, according to
a nationwide survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Many economists predicted that rates would probably hold at this
level, given the modest growth expected for the economy this year.
   ``I think we have seen the lowest rates for mortgages but I
don't believe they will rise much from where they are now,'' said
James Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of Savings
Associations.
   The 8.9 percent rise in housing starts in February was the
sharpest monthly gain since a 12.7 percent rise in December 1986.
   Housing permits, considered a good sign of future economic
activity, also rose sharply in February, jumping 11.5 percent to an
annual rate of 1.40 million units, also the biggest monthly gain
since December 1986.
   The strength in construction starts last month came in both the
single-family and apartment sectors.
   Construction of single-family homes rose 9.3 percent in February
to a seasonally adjusted 1.10 million units while multi-family
units rose by 7.8 percent to an annual rate of 399,000 units.
   David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of
Home Builders, said that the improvement in construction in
February put housing on track with his forecasts for construction
of about 1.49 million units this year, a drop of about 8 percent
from the number of units built in 1987.
   ``We are not looking for 1988 to be a wonderful year but we are
cautiously optimistic that we can get through the year without
further declines,'' Seiders said.
   The strength was widespread in all sections of the country
except the West, where starts fell 9 percent. Housing starts rose
25.6 percent in the South, 13.8 percent in the Midwest and 2.7
percent in the Northeast.
   The report on industrial production said that the 0.2 percent
February increase was the fifth in a row but the weakest advance
since output fell 0.2 percent in September.
   February production was held back by a further drop in activity
at auto plants, where manufacturers have been scaling back plans in
an effort to reduce a huge backlog of unsold cars.
   Production in manufacturing rose 0.2 percent while output in the
mining industry was down a sharp 0.8 percent, reflecting cutbacks
in coal production. Output at the nation's utilities rose 0.7
percent.

   A man who attacked with gunfire
and grenades from behind a tombstone killed three people and
wounded 52 at an IRA graveside service Wednesday before enraged
mourners cornered and beat him.
   Police arrested the man at the end of a wild chase over graves
in the Milltown Roman Catholic cemetery during which he hurled
grenades at the pursuing mourners and fired until his gun jammed.
   A companion fled in a van parked on a nearby highway, witnesses
said.
   Thousands of mourners screamed and dived for cover when shots
shattered the silence of the cemetery as the coffins of three
unarmed IRA members killed by British soldiers in Gibraltar were
being lowered into a single grave.
   One of the wounded was in critical condition and four were
seriously wounded, a spokesman for Royal Victoria Hospital said.
Most victims were shot or hit by shrapnel while scrambling for
cover behind gravestones.
   Sinn Fein, legal political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican
Army, blamed Protestant paramilitary groups and accused Britain of
collusion.
   In London, aides of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she
was ``shocked and appalled.''
   Her government denounced the attack as ``insane and depraved.''
It appealed for calm, as did Sinn Fein, church leaders and the
Irish Republic government in Dublin.
   Within hours, however, Catholic youths took to the streets in
the ghettos of West Belfast. They shot at British soldiers and
hijacking and burned buses. Black smoke hung over several
neighborhoods.
   Police, the British government and the Ulster Defense
Association, an umbrella organization of Protestant vigilante
groups, all denied complicity.
   Police gave no immediate indication whether the badly beaten
attacker was a Protestant. The largely Catholic IRA is waging a
guerrilla war to drive the British from Protestant-dominated
Northern Ireland, and Protestant paramilitary groups have grown up
to fight it.
   Martin McGuinness, vice president of Sinn Fein, said: ``It's
obvious it was an attack by Loyalist (Protestant) movements.''
   Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said: ``There was collusion
between elements with the British Crown forces, probably the Royal
Ulster Constabulary (provincial police).''
   Police said they deliberately kept away from the funeral because
of assurances that the IRA would not turn them it into a
paramilitary display.
   Commandos in civilian clothes killed the guerrillas, Mairead
Farrell, 31; Sean Savage, 24, and Daniel McCann, 30, on March 6.
British officials said they were on a mission to bomb a public
military ceremony at the fortress colony in southern Spain.
   They were buried beside dozens of other guerrillas killed in the
IRA battle against the British, which began in August 1969.
   Mourners, with a priest officiating, were lowering Miss
Farrell's flag-draped coffin into the grave when a bearded man
opened fire 15 yards away from behind a gravestone.
   Young men yelled ``There he is! There he is!'' and the thickset
gunman bolted toward the highway.
   His cap fell off as he reloaded his pistol, and still dodging
and weaving, fired at the youths and hurled two grenades while
taunting the pursuers to keep coming, witnesses said.
   ``I saw a young man throwing things from the back of the
mourners,'' said the Rev. Alec Reid, who was saying prayers beside
the open grave. ``I thought they were stones, but it looks as if
they were grenades. He was also firing shots into the crowd. There
was absolute chaos.''
   Adams said the attack involved two men who parked the van beside
the cemetery, walked in carrying bags and cameras, and were
mistaken for journalists.
   As the one attacker fled, the other fired a volleys of covering
shots but then escaped in the van, Adams said.
   The attack occurred after moderate Andy Tyrie was ousted as
leader of the Ulster Defenses Association. Hardliners accused him
of weakening the armed fight against the IRA.
   New UDA leaders held a news conferene Monday. They would not
reveal their identities, but told reporters their aim was to
``target the IRA and Irish National Liberation Army,'' a Marxist
offshoot.
   More than 2,600 people have been killed in Northern Ireland's
sectarian violence since August 1969.

``All-American Girl of the Year'' in a contest co-sponsored by
'Teen Magazine.
   ``I have this permanent smile on my face,'' Charlene Brown, a
student at Stuyvesant High School, said after she was chosen from
among five finalists.
   Miss Brown said the '80s definition of an all-American girl is
``somebody who tries her best and strives to do something out of
the ordinary. It's somebody who likes to do things that are
different, who takes chances with things that don't necessarily
guarantee success.''
   The other finalists were composer Sherry Lynn Biedrzycki, 12, of
St. Francis, Wis.; astronomer-pilot Jennifer Lynn Patience, 17, of
Thousand Oaks, Calif.; athlete Tamara Ann Shepherd, 17, of Eagle
River, Alaska; and pianist Jennifer Watson, 14, of Bountiful, Ohio.
   Miss Brown previously won a ``Future Biochemist's Award'' for
her performance in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
introductory engineering and science program.
   She was summer program director for the Junior Academy of
Sciences in 1987 and a judge for the American Institute of Science
and Technology Science Fair.
   ``I try to give my all to everything I'm involved in,'' she
said. ``That requires a lot of time management, being able to
establish priorities.''
   Her father, Franklin, an accountant, and her mother, Pauline, a
nurse, are immigrants from Jamaica. Her sister, Shanna, is 9.
   At home, she was ``encouraged to do my best from very early on.
And at my school, everybody works hard. Everybody is motivated,
striving to reach for the top. That kind of atmosphere encourages
you to work even harder,'' she said.
   The prize is a $5,000 scholarship, which she will use next fall
at MIT, studying chemical engineering before going on to medical
school.
   ``A lot of teen-agers are classified _ because of drinking and
driving, pregnancies and crime _ as awful and violent,'' said Miss
Brown. ``But plenty of teen-agers are not even recognized for
accomplishments.''
   Now, Miss Brown will be a role model. ``I can handle it,'' she
said. ``It's great.''
   Noxzema Skin Cream was the other sponsor of the event.

<HEAD>Botha Meets Tutu, Nixes Clemency For Sharpeville Six</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha on
Wednesday rejected worldwide appeals to halt the hangings of the
``Sharpeville Six'' as defense lawyers launched a bid to save the
condemned blacks.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, in a rare meeting with Botha,
urged the president to heed the widespread appeals for clemency.
The black Nobel Peace laureate emerged after 40 minutes in Botha's
Cape Town office to say the president had ruled out personal
intervention.
   ``If ever there was a case for the state president to exercise
his discretion, and grant clemency, this is it,'' said defense
lawyer Prakash Diar.
   ``They are very simple, ordinary people who do not see
themselves as political martyrs.''
   Defense lawyers, battling for a stay of execution, filed an
appeal in Pretoria Supreme Court citing new evidence. The appeal
contended that a prosecution witness committed perjury after being
told by police to implicate two of the defendants.
   The five men and one woman, convicted of a 1984 mob killing of a
black township official even though no evidence showed their direct
involvement, are scheduled to hang at dawn Friday at Pretoria
Central Prison.
   Justice W.J. Human, who sentenced the six to the gallows two
years ago, will consider the appeal Thursday. A finding of new
evidence is the only means available to stop the hangings now that
Botha has refused to commute the sentence.
   The condemned are Theresa Ramashamola, 26; Mojalefa Sefatsa, 32;
Reid Mokoena, 24; Oupa Diniso, 32; Duma Khumalo, 28; and Francis
Mokgesi, 30.
   The six were convicted by white judges of murder in connection
with the September 1984 killing of black township councilor Jacob
Dlamini in Sharpeville, about 40 miles south of Johannesburg.
   The attorneys submitted documents Wednesday stating that Joseph
Manete, a black who testified anonymously during the 1984 trial,
has claimed he was brutalized by police.
   According to the documents, Manete said officers told him to say
in an affidavit that he had seen two of the defendants at the scene
even though he had not.
   Defense lawyers tried during the trial to question Manete about
his statements to his own lawyer on the alleged police action, but
the court objected, citing attorney-client privilege. In documents
submitted to Human on Wednesday, Manete waives those rights and the
protection of anonymity.
   Defense lawyers said they would request a retrial if the stay of
execution is granted.
   The planned execution of the six has drawn condemnation and
calls for clemency from religious and political leaders from around
the world, including President Reagan and leaders in Britain,
France and West Germany.
   On Wednesday, the European Economic Community appealed to South
Africa to spare them.
   The case is controversial because no evidence was produced to
directly link the six to Dlamini's death.
   They were convicted under the doctrine of ``common purpose,''
which holds they were responsible for the killing by joining a
crowd of 100 people who gathered at Dlamini's home with the intent
to kill him. He was stoned and burned to death.
   Dlamini was killed in riots which began a two-year outbreak of
nationwide anti-apartheid unrest that left more than 2,000 blacks
dead. Activists frequently targeted black township councilors,
considering them collaborators with the government.

   Officials who considered going out of
business to avoid road maintenance costs have decided the cost of
not having a town government could be much higher.
   Expected development at the gateway to adjacent Voyageurs
National Park requires a government, with its planning and zoning
powers, the officials decided.
   ``We're never going to have the kind of crowds they have at
Yellowstone, Yosemite or Glacier, but the traffic's going to
increase,'' Mayor Mike Williams said Tuesday. ``We're going to get
some development and we're going to have to have planning to
control it.''
   The opening last summer of the national park's visitor center
spurred the beginnings of new development, including a recently
built mobile home park and plans for a condominium project.
   Officials hope to stay ahead of any development by finishing a
comprehensive plan within a year, the mayor said.
   Officials also were swayed by residents of this northern
Minnesota town of 101 people, who opposed the plan just as they had
a similar proposal in 1984.
   Officials hoped to pass their road maintenance costs on to
Koochiching County by dissolving the government. Improvement of the
town's five miles of mostly gravel roads was estimated to cost as
much as $200,000, but the town could barely afford its $8,000
maintenance budget.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Head Says 15 Vessels Detected Fishing Illegally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Alaska senator called for a temporary ban
on fishing in part of the Bering Sea as the Coast Guard said
Wednesday that 15 foreign vessels have been detected fishing
illegally in Alaskan waters over the past 18 months.
   Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Yost said the vessels did not
include the seven Japanese trawlers videotaped by American
fishermen in Janaury nor six Polish vessels spotted by a National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plane in February.
   Yost said it was impossible to catch any of the ships spotted by
Coast Guard planes because they were long gone before a cutter
could arrive on the scene, but information on the sightings was
sent to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council.
   ``You can't cite them from an aircraft. You need ships to do the
actual enforcement,'' Yost told reporters, adding the Coast Guard
has two ships to patrol the 800,000-square mile U.S. fishing zone
off Alaska.
   Yost was among the dozen witnesses that testified before the
Senate Commerce Committee about illegal fishing in American waters
and possible overfishing in an area of the Bering Sea known as the
``doughnut hole.''
   Alaska Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, a committee member, said he
would introduce a resolution calling on the State Deparment to open
talks with the Soviet Union about closing the ``doughnut hole'' to
all fishing until scientists complete studies of the area.
   Other witnesses told the committee:
   _Evdience in a 1982-1983 court case showed the existence of a
``master plan by the Japanese fishing fleet in Alaskan waters to
evade enforcement vessels and manipulate catch records.''
   _The Soviet Union revoked the licenses of the captains of
several of its fishing boats in April 1987 after the U.S. Coast
Guard spotted the vessels fishing in American waters.
   _Overfishing by foreign fleets in the international waters off
the Bering Sea may ultimately affect the fish harvest by domestic
fishermen in the U.S. zone.
   In addition, committee staff released a letter from Kazuo Shima,
councillor of the Japanese Fisheries Agency in Tokyo, that said
reports of illegal fishing in the American zone were ``vastly
exaggerated.''
   The letter to Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., committee chairman,
also called for ``multilateral talks'' about the Bering Sea fishery.
   Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for oceans and
fisheries, said the Reagan administration was reviewing the legal
implications of such a closure.
   The catch by fishing vessels from Japan, Korea, Poland and China
in the 4,500-square-mile ``doughnut hole'' has risen from about
200,000 metric tons in 1984 over 1 million metric tons in 1987.

<HEAD>Carlucci, Yazov Discuss Variety of Issues in First Such Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pentagon spokesman said Wednesday
that the first formal talks between the superpower defense
secretaries were productive and friendly, despite the raising of
sensitive issues by the United States.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and his Soviet counterpart,
Dmitri Yazov, discussed strategic nuclear weapons, the
implementation of the superpower treaty to eliminate medium- and
shorter-range nuclear missiles and the size of their respective
armed forces, said Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard.
   Carlucci and Yazov met privately with only their translators
present for 10 minutes at the opening of the afternoon session, at
the Soviet Embassy, and emerged quiet and grim. Neither side would
comment on the private session.
   Earlier, the mood had appeared jovial, although Carlucci raised
U.S. allegations that the Soviets violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty by building a phased-array radar far from the Soviet
border in Siberia. The pact requires such radars to be along the
border.
   The talks are scheduled to end Thursday.
   ``The tone has been very positive and cooperative throughout,''
said Howard, the assistant secretary of defense for public affairs.
``We are pleased with the way things are going.''
   During the afternoon session, Howard said Carlucci questioned
Yazov about ``dangerous activities,'' such as the physical contact
between U.S. and Soviet ships in the Black Sea last month and the
fatal shooting of Army Maj. Arthur Nicholson by a Soviet soldier
three years ago in East Germany.
   The United States said the Soviet ships intentionally bumped the
U.S. ships.
   Carlucci said earlier he would seek a Soviet apology for the
slaying of Nicholson and try to work out new guidelines to prevent
friction between U.S. and Soviet ground, air and naval forces.
   A spokesman for the Soviet Embassy in Bern, Vladimir Pozdniakov,
said the Soviet delegation would not comment on the talks until
Yazov and an aide, Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, address a news
conference Thursday.
   Carlucci was also to give a full version of the U.S. position at
a news conference Thursday.
   Yazov opened the formal talks Wednesday on a light note, said
Howard.
   Gesturing around the second-floor conference room of the U.S.
Embassy, Yazov ``commented that (it) ... was a very small room, and
said there is a saying in Russian that although we have close
quarters, we shouldn't quarrel.''
   ``Everyone got a laugh out of that,'' said Howard.
   Reporters and photographers were allowed briefly into the rooms
where the conferences and meals were held but were ushered out as
talks began.
   ``The main point that Mr. Yazov made in the beginning was that
he wanted to have useful discussions without having the pressure of
negotiations ... to arrive at some sort of agreement,'' said Howard.
   The defense ministers faced each other across a long table,
Carlucci flanked by Assistant Defense Secretary Ronald Lehman and a
translator, and Yazov by a translator and Chervov, a top Soviet
arms control spokesman.
   Before leaving Moscow, Yazov said he was ``prepared to discuss
issues of preventing incidents between the armed forces of the
United States and the U.S.S.R.''
   And he said he hoped for ``a frank, constructive discussion'' of
arms control issues including strategic arms, nuclear testing,
chemical and conventional weapons.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Soviets Not Dealing `Seriously' To Resolve Afghan
Fighting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has failed to ``deal
seriously'' with issues that need to be resolved for a settlement
in Afghanistan, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
Wednesday.
   In response to reporters' questions, Redman reacted to a Soviet
announcement blaming ``procrastination and delay'' by the United
States and Pakistan for Moscow's inability to meet a March 15
deadline for agreement on a withdrawal of its troops from
Afghanistan.
   The Soviets had said that if the agreement was reached in United
Nations-sponsored talks in Geneva by that date, it could begin the
pullout on May 15.
   Redman said in reponse, ``The March 15 target date was an
artificial and arbitrary date put forward by the Soviet Union. The
Soviet Union knows full well that an agreement cannot be reached
without their commitment to a complete withdrawal in the context of
a safeguarded and comprehensive settlement.
   ``We're disappointed that the Soviet Union has chosen to make a
public issue out of the arbitrary date rather than deal seriously
with the issues which remain to be resolved before the Geneva
process can be concluded.''
   Still to be settled, he said, are precise details of the
withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops and the way the
Afghan government will be organized after the Soviets leave.
   The United States and the Soviet Union must also reach an
understanding about how they will cease aid to their clients in
Afghanistan _ the Soviet-backed government and the U.S.-backed
resistance forces, Redman said.
   He reiterated the U.S. determination to aid the Afghan rebels as
long as the Soviets assist the Kabul regime.
   The Soviets have objected to this condition on grounds the
United States has no right to tell Moscow it cannot support a
legitimate government, but the United States has said the Afghan
government is merely a ``faction'' in what is essentially a civil
war.

   The Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday it
is sending tax bills averaging $4,000 to thousands of civilian
employees of the U.S. military who work abroad.
   As many as 40,000 of these civilians work in military
commissaries and recreation facilities. They are known as NAF
employees because they are paid out of non-appropriated funds _
typically from the revenues of those facilities.
   The IRS said the employees may owe as much as $30 million in
back taxes because they wrongly claimed the foreign-income
exclusion, which allows Americans working abroad to exempt up to
$70,000 a year from U.S. taxes. This benefit is not available to
government employees, but many NAF workers insist they are not
government employees because of the source of their paychecks.
   The IRS has rejected that distinction since 1954, but said
taxpayers who disagree may appeal.
   The agency said it already has mailed audit reports and tax
bills to 600 employees in West Germany.

   An engine room fire Wednesday disabled a cruise
ship off the Mexican coast, but the crew extinguished the blaze and
the ship with 715 people aboard was towed to port.
   The Navy cutter Vigilant escorted the 465-foot ship, the
Scandinavian Star, as a precaution, according to Chief Petty
Officer Luis Diaz of the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami.
   ``The fire is out and the ship is being towed by the Mexican
navy to Cancun,'' said Diaz.
   There were no injuries from the fire, but a 71-year-old St.
Petersburg man who suffered a heart attack was in stable condition
and on his way home aboard a Coast Guard plane.
   A second person who suffered a spinal cord injury was also
evacuated with the heart attack victim, but Diaz said that injury
also was apparently not related to the fire.
   The ship was expected to arrive in Cancun late Wednesday or
Thursday. The 449 passengers will be flown to St. Petersburg, said
Jill DeChello, spokesman for the ship's owner, SeaEscape Ltd. of
Miami.
   The Scandinavian Star was on a 3-day cruise to Cozumel, Mexico,
and was returning to St. Petersburg when the fire broke out about 1
a.m. EST Wednesday, she said.
   The crew sealed off the engine room and pumped in carbon dioxide
to put out the fire.
   ``They used all their CO2 and closed off the engine room,'' said
Diaz. ``Then they requested more assistance from the Coast Guard.''
The fire was already extinguished when the Vigilant arrived about
10 a.m., he added.
   Ms. DeChello said the company did not know what sparked the fire.
   ``It will take a week before we know the cause and the extent of
the damage,'' said Ms. DeChello.
   In August 1984, a fire struck the Star's sister ship, the
Scandinavian Sun, in the port of Miami, killing a passenger and a
crewman.
   ``I feel they are two totally different incidents that are in no
way related,'' said Ms. DeChello. She said the cruise line was
inspected by the Coast Guard and rigorously enforced all safety
rules.
   Wednesday's fire occurred as the Scandinavian Star was about 35
miles off Isla Mujeres, a Mexican island north of the tourist
resort Cancun in the Yucatan peninsula, the Coast Guard said.

   Warren County officials have agreed to
pay $166,000 to the family of a 5-year-old boy who was arrested at
his home one night, taken to jail, informed of his rights and
interrogated about vandalism at a construction site.
   The settlement came Monday, when a trial was to have begun in
U.S. District Court on the family's lawsuit against several
officials. The county also will pay attorneys' fees. The settlement
will be paid by the county's insurance company over 21 years.
   Jeremy Lance, now 9, began having nightmares, visions of the
devil and fears of dying soon after the incident, said his mother,
Billie Jean Lance Myers. The boy has been seeing a psychiatrist,
she said.
   ``He knows he was done wrong, and this is to set things
straight,'' she said. ``Maybe knowing this is all over, there will
be a sense of relief.''
   The family sued former Warren County Deputy Sheriff Billy
Prater, now a highway patrolman; former Youth Services Officer Dale
Potter, now city judge in McMinnville; the county sheriff; and the
county executive.
   Ms. Myers said Prater came to her house about 10:30 p.m. on June
5, 1984, and took Jeremy in a patrol car to jail, where Prater and
Potter questioned the boy. Ms. Myers said she was kept waiting for
about 30 minutes before she was allowed to see her son.
   ``We think the sum paid to Jeremy ... compensates Jeremy for the
damage done to him and the horrible nightmare he has lived
through,'' said the family's attorney, Michael Galligan.
   The suit was dismissed once by U.S. District Judge Thomas Hull,
but reinstated by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Cincinnati.

the arms-for-hostages deals with Iran and the diversion of profits
to the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when Congress banned direct U.S.
military aid to the Contras.
   The indictment variously charged the defendants with conspiracy,
theft of government property, obstruction of justice, false

   No individual contracts will be signed during
the Writers Guild of America strike, meaning the ``Tonight Show''
and other daily programs will get no new material until the walkout
ends, the guild announced Wednesday.
   The vote by the guild council reverses the position taken in
earlier strikes, when individual waivers were approved for certain
programs, including Johnny Carson's ``Tonight Show.''
   The stance also reiterates the guild position that none of its
writers will work on next month's Academy Awards broadcast.
   ``The council has decided to table all consideration of
independent contracts until a future time,'' said Mona Mangan,
executive director of the Writers Guild East, in a statement
released after the vote.
   The strike by the 9,000-member guild against the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers began March 7. Striking
writers in Hollywood and New York City have been walking picket
lines.
   The writers had rejected an offer from the producers a day
earlier. It marks the fourth walkout since 1973 by the WGA; the
longest, in 1981, lasted 17 weeks.
   The guild also announced Wednesday that the Canadian and British
Writers Guilds have asked their members to support the walkout
unless they had contracted for work prior to the strike.

<HEAD>Output Edges Up 0.2 Percent In February</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. industrial production edged up 0.2
percent in February as reductions in output at auto factories and
coal mines offset gains in other areas, the government reported
Wednesday.
   The Federal Reserve said that the February advance, which
followed a 0.3 percent January gain, was the poorest showing since
output actually declined by 0.2 percent in September.
   But private economists said the gains, even at a much slower
pace, represented good news for the economy, especially given fears
that production would have to be cut back sharply in the early part
of 1988 in order to work off high levels of unsold goods.
   ``There is nothing here that signals anything dangerous for the
economy,'' said Maury Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber. ``We
are slowing down, but we are not slowing all that much.''
   Industrial output had surged ahead with monthly increases of 1.1
percent in October and 0.5 percent in both November and December.
However, much of that production went into inventories of unsold
goods as consumer spending fell during the final three months of
the year.
   Economists had worried that factories would cut back production
so much in the early part of 1988 that it could topple the country
into a recession.
   But recent business statistics, including the continued advances
in production, rising consumer spending and strong gains in
employment, have eased those fears.
   ``The industrial production figures depict an economy that is
growing less rapidly but really looks pretty healthy,'' said Jerry
Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   U.S. manufacturers have enjoyed a significant rebound in output
over the past year as the weaker dollar has boosted export sales.
Forecasts of continued economic growth this year are relying
heavily on those advances to cntinue.
   Jasinowski said a recent survey of the association's members
found that a significant 20 percent of the companies were looking
forward to higher sales this year.
   ``They see a lot of strength in their markets and very little
probability of a recession,'' he said.
   The February increase included a 0.2 percent rise in production
at manufacturing plants, identical to the gain in January.
   Auto production fell 0.9 percent in February and now stands 8.5
percent below where it was in October. The output of passenger cars
was 6.1 million units at an annual rate, a small improvement over
January, but this was offset by a drop in production of light
trucks.
   Factories making durable goods, items expected to last three or
more years, saw output rise by 0.2 percent last month while output
at plants making nondurable goods edged up 0.1 percent.
   Output in the mining industry dropped 0.8 percent in February,
the third consecutive monthly decline. The setback last month was
blamed on a drop in coal production.
   Output at the nation's utilities rose 0.7 percent in February
following a 1.8 percent January increase.
   The various changes left industrial production at 134.4 percent
of its 1977 base of 100.

   Filming a documentary inside the Soviet Union
cannot occur without omnipresent government officials,
state-selected interviewees and limited access to certain areas.
   Despite the restrictions, executive producer Ira Miskin said he
didn't believe his seven-hour documentary, ``Portrait of the Soviet
Union,'' was compromised.
   Many of the Soviets who appear in the film, to be shown in
installments on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday on Ted Turner's
SuperStation TBS, are members of the Communist Party, hand-picked
by the government to appear in the film. Officials from
Gostelradio, the state broadcasting committee, accompanied his
crews on nearly every shoot.
   ``At the end, we had to rely on our own judgment,'' said Miskin.
``And you also see the pictures. You can say anything you want over
pictures, but the pictures _ what's going on the frame _ don't
lie.''
   Nevertheless, the result is a flattering depiction of life in
the Soviet Union _ an official portrait, beautifully photographed,
showing only the occasional wart.
   The series does mention the Soviet Union's problems, but only
those that have been raised in the state-controlled media:
bureaucratic sluggishness, shoddy workmanship, complaints about
consumer goods and housing.
   Larger problems are inexplicably absent, given the briefest of
mentions, or left for viewers to discern for themselves. These
include the struggles over Jewish emigration and human rights, the
explosive nature of the nation's more than 100 nationalities, the
issue of who really wields Kremlin power, and the massive military
budget and the war in Afghanistan.
   ``I think the films do look to some degree pro-Soviet,'' Miskin
said in an interview. ``I think that our intention was for certain
aspects of it to look pro-Soviet. Not pro-Soviet government, but
pro-Soviet people.''
   The first episode, which is about the ethnic Russians, is fairly
typical. There is poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the one-time rebel who
is now part of the establishment, reading a few lines from his epic
work about the Holocaust, ``Babi Yar.'' That's the only reference
to anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union in the entire seven hours.
   Miskin, who is of Russian extraction and Jewish, said he could
not ``in good conscience'' overlook the problems of Soviet Jewry,
but he added that ``it's a much more complicated story than can be
done in this kind of survey piece. It's a story that deserves its
own hour.
   ``So to the extent that we ignored Jewish emigration, we could
not ignore the fact that anti-Semitism existed and exists in the
Soviet Union. It is a fact of life. You gotta mention it. We did,''
he said.
   What gets more than a mention is music and dancing.
   There's dancing by Leningrad ballerinas and Russians dressed as
Cossacks; by teen-agers in discos and old men straight from a
yogurt commercial; by the Georgian state dance troupe and bemedaled
Red Army veterans.
   So much foot-stomping and high-kicking is in the series that
some viewers may get the impression the biggest name in the Soviet
Union isn't Lenin or Stalin, but Danskin.
   Miskin, who also did the upbeat ``Portrait of America'' series
for TBS, said he wanted to draw in the general audience with the
music and dance, then give viewers an understanding of the Soviet
lifestyle, politics and economy.
   Such an overemphasis on dance weakened the segment that profiled
the peoples of Georgia and Armenia, Miskin said.
   One troubling part comes in the episode on central Asia, in
which an official involved in the restoration of mosques is allowed
to deliver the statement: ``Times change. Islam is not so popular
now.''
   The documentary allows the statement to go unchallenged, even
though there are 45 million Moslems in the Soviet Union _ 16
percent of the population _ and many practice their faith regularly
despite Kremlin oppression.
   Miskin replied that ``our perception was ... the general
consensus seems to be that Islam is a mile wide and an inch deep,
rather than a mile deep and an inch wide. ... So, we couldn't find
a way to challenge it, essentially.''
   The strongest of the segments by far is the sixth hour, a moving
piece on how World War II affected the Soviet Union. Miskin does a
good job of blending historic war footage and poignant interviews
with elderly widows and veterans.
   Other episodes look at life in Siberia and the Baltic republics.
The final hour summarizes the series and features a lot of footage
from the Goodwill Games, the international sports competition that
Turner conceived with the Soviets.

   A federal grand jury today indicted former
national security adviser John Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver North,
and two arms dealers on conspiracy charges in the diversion of
Iranian arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The long-awaited 23-count indictment _ which in addition to
North and Poindexter also named retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard
V. Secord and his business partner, Albert Hakim _ culminated a
14-month grand jury investigation into the arms-for-hostages deals
with Iran and the diversion of funds to the Contras.
   The grand jury said the four men ``deceitfully and without legal
authorization'' organized, directed and concealed ``a program to
continue funding of and logistical and other support for military
and paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by the Contras'' at a time
U.S. law barred such action.
   The four defrauded the government ``by deceitfully exploiting
for their own purposes'' U.S. arms sales to Iran, ``rather than
pursuing solely the specified governmental objectives of the
initiative, including the release of Americans being held hostage
in Lebanon,'' the grand jury said
   One count said the defendants embezzled and converted to their
own use proceeds generated by the weapons sales to Iran. It was
reported in the indictment that the arms sales generated
approximately $30 million, while the U.S. government was paid only
$12.2 million for the weapons.
   The indictment stated the conspiracy began in late spring or
early summer of 1985 and continued through at least December 1986.
   The central conspiracy count charges that Poindexter, North,
Secord and Hakim ``together with others known and unknown''
conspired to defraud the United States by obstructing lawful
government functions.
   The indictment variously charged the defendants with conspiracy,
theft of government property, obstruction of justice, false
statements, falsification, destruction and removal of documents.
   The indictment said the conspiracy deprived the government ``of
the honest and faithful services of employees'' by using the
positions of Poindexter and North to generate funds for Secord and
Hakim.
   North was named in nine counts charging him with obstruction of
Congress, making false statements, obstructing the presidential
inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair in November 1986, and
concealing, falsifying or destroying official documents.
   Poindexter was named in two counts of obstructing a
congressional inquiry and two other counts of false statements.
   The three counts in which all four were charged _ conspiracy to
defraud the United States and commit offenses against the
government, theft of government property and wire fraud arising
from the diversion of the arms sale proceeds _ carry together
maximum penalties of 25 years' imprisonment. Each charge carries a
maximum fine of $250,000.
   Each of the obstruction and false statement charges against
North and Poindexter carries a five-year sentence and $250,000 fine.
   The destruction of documents charge against North carries a
three-year term.
   Hakim and Secord, among other things, were charged with
conspiracy to pay illegal gratuities to North and his family to
further the sale of arms to Iran so that Secord and Hakim ``would
continue to receive opportunities for substantial revenues and
profits'' from ``lucrative activities referred to them by North and
facilitated by him.''
   This charge listed a series of two payments totaling $16,000 to
security expert, Glenn Robinette, who installed a security system
at North's home in Great Falls, Va.
   The indictment also charged that Hakim created an investment
account containing $200,000 in a Swiss bank for the financial
benefit of the North family.
   Secord and Hakim were also charged with offering an illegal
gratuity to North in return for his support of the private supply
network for the Contras and Iran arms sales.
   North was charged with receipt of an illegal gratuity stemming
from the installation of the security system. The charge carries a
two-year sentence and a $250,000 fine.
   North was also charged with pocketing at least $4,300 of the
$90,000 in traveler's checks from Contra leader Adolfo Calero. The
charge alleged that Calero had given the traveler's checks to North
for efforts to help release U.S. hostages in Lebanon and to help
support the Contras.
   North was also charged with conspiracy to defraud the government
in connection with the use of a tax-exempt foundation that raised
several million dollars in private donations to help arm the
Contras. Two conservative fund-raisers, Carl R. ``Spitz'' Channell
and Richard Miller, pleaded guilty last spring to the same charge
and identified North as a co-conspirator.
   Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and several of his top
prosecutors made a final presentation to the panel.
   Last week, former national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane,
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges that he withheld information
from Congress in 1985 and in 1986 about covert administration
efforts to help the Contras during the ban on direct U.S. military
aid.
   The 1985-1986 sales to Iran were part of an effort to trade arms
for U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian terrorist
organizations.
   Congressional investigators determined that of the $16 million
in profits from the arms sales, $3.8 million went to the Contras
when the congressional ban on direct U.S. military aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels was in effect.

<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan rebels on Tuesday
accused the Sandinistas of being totalitarian for refusing to allow
opposition political parties to be represented at cease-fire talks
planned for next week.
   Presidential press spokesman Manuel Espinoza said Monday night
that the leftist government vetoed the rebel request last week.
   ``One of the reasons is space,'' Espinoza said. ``There's just
not room for a mountain of people.''
   The first face-to-face talks in Nicaraguan territory between the
government and rebels, known as Contras, are set to begin Monday at
Sapoa, a border post near the Costa Rican border. The meeting had
been set for last week, but the government canceled it after the
Contras at the last minute insisted on a preliminary meeting to
work out the topics for discussion.
   The rebels backed off that demand and both sides agreed to an
open agenda. One issue the Contras want to include in the
discussions is a proposal by Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando
y Bravo that calls for political amnesty and a revision of the
military draft law, among other things. The rebel delegation will
be headed by its top political leader, Adolfo Calero.
   The Sandinistas are insisting that the talks center only on the
mechanics of working out a cease-fire in line with a regional peace
plan the five Central American presidents signed last August.
   The government group will be led by Defense Minister Humberto
Ortega, the brother of President Daniel Ortega.
   A Contra statement Tuesday said Nicaraguan Resistance, as the
rebels are formally called, ``puts special importance and utility
on the participation by the respresentatives of the internal
opposition in the talks, considering its protaganist role in the
Nicaraguan conflict and its participation in a national solution to
the national conflict.''
   The rebel communique, read over the telephone to The Associated
Press, said the rejection of the presence of opposition party
members as well as the dismissal of the cardinal as mediator of the
negotiations confirmed the Sandinistas' ``totalitarian tendencies.''
   President Ortega on March 2 said Obando y Bravo's mediation no
longer would be needed because the talks would be direct. The move
was seen here as retaliation for the cardinal's proposal, which
included political themes that the government said it would not
discuss.
   President Ortega on Tuesday said he did not ``discount that at
the last minute the mercenary forces will come up with pretexts so
the meeting would not take place.''
   An esimtabed 50,000 people have been killed and wounded in the
war that has continued for more than six years.
   President Ortega also proposed Monday the renewal of talks with
the internal political opposition, also a condition of the peace
plan. Those talks broke off last December when the political
parties insisted on discussing a change in the constitution.
   The peace outline was signed in August by the presidents of
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica. It
seeks to end wars here, in El Salvador and Guatemala.
   It calls for cease-fires, political amnesties, democratic
reforms and an end to logistic or strategic support for
insurgencies.

   President Reagan's former national security
adviser, John M. Poindexter, and fired White House aide Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North were indicted Wednesday along with two arms dealers
on charges they conspired to divert Iranian arms sales profits to
the Nicaraguan Contras.
   The long-awaited 23-count indictment, which also named retired

<HEAD>$3.5 Million In Matching Funds Certified By FEC For 11 Candidates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission certified
almost $3.5 million in new federal matching funds on Wednesday for
11 presidential candidates, including nearly $900,000 for Pat
Robertson whose Republican campaign is winding down.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis continued to lead the
Democratic money race, qualifying for more than $600,000 in new
matching funds and raising his matching total to more than twice
that of his competitors for his party's nomination.
   Vice President George Bush, who has a big lead in the Republican
contest, got in line for a new quarter of a million dollars in
federal funds, keeping his edge in the category.
   In all, the new funds raise the total certified thus far for 14
candidates to $45.44 million.
   Presidential candidates qualify for matching funds by raising at
least $5,000 in individual contributions of $250 or less in at
least 20 states. After qualifying, every individual contribution of
$250 or less is matched dollar-for-dollar by federal funds. The
money comes from the voluntary $1 checkoff on federal tax returns.
   Candidates lose eligibility for matching funds for new
contributions by withdrawing from the race or by failing to win at
least 10 percent of the vote in two consecutive primaries in which
they compete.
   Here are the Republican presidential hopefuls, the amount of new
money certified Wednesday and the total certified thus far:
   Bush, $247,118.92, $6,859,448.66.
   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, $380,928.96, $6,604,354.65.
   Former Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware, who has withdrawn, 0,
$2,300,502.23.
   Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, who has withdrawn,
$45,237.64, $484,622.29.
   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, who has withdrawn, 0, $4,506,454.78.
   Robertson, $896,551.91, $8,138,333.65.
   Among the Democratic candidates, here are the figures:
   Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who has withdrawn, 0,
$870,133.58.
   Dukakis, $621,098.39, $5,684,114.11.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, $161,107.89, $2,340,696.53.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, $336,312.04, $2,540,541.74.
   Former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado, who has withdrawn, $5,399.68,
$1,122,281.67.
   Jesse Jackson, $330,189.60, $1,047,538.32.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, $397,839.29, $2,637,867.28.
   Independent candidate Lenora B. Fulani qualified for $44,548.96,
raising her total in federal matching funds thus far to $307,225.19.

   At least 10 firefighters have become ill
after battling a weekend fire that destroyed a warehouse containing
thousands of chemicals, authorities said Wednesday.
   Several residents of a nearby mobile home park also reported
rashes and other adverse health effects after Saturday night's fire
in the town of Seabrook, which was the worst accident involving
hazardous materials in state history.
   ``Until we take a look at specifically what compounds were
involved, it's difficult to evaluate the seriousness of the health
implications,'' said Brian Strohm, deputy director of the state
Division of Public Health. He was unaware of anyone being
hospitalized.
   State Fire Marshal Bill Toland said some of the 75 to 80
firefighters called in to extinguish the fire have reported nausea,
tightness in their chests and other symptoms.
   Toland said Exeter's fire chief ordered his firefighters to go
to a hospital for blood tests _ and the chief himself wasn't
feeling well.
   Strohm estimated that 10 to 14 firefighters have fallen ill. He
said the state became aware of the illnesses Tuesday. He said he
was not aware of any new illnesses since then.
   The firedestroyed an 8,000-square-foot warehouse of the Aesar
Division of Johnson Matthey, an international precious metals
company with U.S. headquarters in Malvern, Pa.
   Johnson Matthey officials did not immediately return a telephone
message Wednesday afternoon.
   The warehouse contained about 3,000 chemicals, including heavy
metals and inorganic chemicals, the company said in a statement.
   Officials said the fire caused millions of dollars in damages
and will cost millions more to clean up. Johnson Matthey has hired
Clean Harbors Inc. of Kingston, Mass., to conduct the cleanup.
   Federal and state investigators on Wednesday continued trying to
determine the cause of the fire. Toland said investigators from the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms believe it was
accidental.
   Another fire broke out in Seabrook at the same time Saturday
night, at an abandoned lumber yard. That fire caused an estimated
$500,000 damages. Toland said its cause also remains unknown.
   About 80 residents of a trailer park were evacuated when wind
shifted and blew a plume from the chemical fire in their direction.
   Fearing that radioactive materials could have been stored in the
warehouse, some firefighters were tested for radiation exposure but
the tests were negative. Officials from the stalled Seabrook
nuclear power plant provided testing assistance.
   Strohm said determining possible health risks from the warehouse
fire is difficult because some of the chemicals' properties may
have changed when mixed with each other and with water and when
they burned.
   Barbara Curtis, Johnson Matthey's manager for environmental
affairs, said Clean Harbors workers have finished cleaning the
warehouse parking lot and are building a temporary cover over the
fire site to prevent any precipitation from seeping through.
   State hazardous-waste officials have said they are conducting
laboratory tests of the runoff but have not received results.

   The Democratic presidential race was as scrambled as the
Republican contest was clear Wednesday after Sen. Paul Simon's
Illinois victory enhanced the chances the Democrats would met this
summer without an obvious nominee.
   On the Republican side, the biggest question appeared to be
merely whether _ or when _ George Bush's rivals, trounced in
primary after primary, would drop out.
   Bush, donning his leader-at-work mantle, lunched with President
Reagan and played dinner host to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir while savoring his 55 percent majority over Bob Dole's 36
percent and Pat Robertson's 7 percent in Tuesday's Illinois
primary, the one that Dole once said would start his turnaround.
   Dole tended business in the Senate and pondered his future. In
the face of defeat, he met with supporters in Washington.
   ``They're all very friendly, very positive, very upbeat, saying
`Hang in there,''' Dole said.
   Robertson, a big loser Tuesday, went home saying he would have
to scale back his effort. He has spent within $2 million of the $27
million allowed by law for the primaries.
   Republican National Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf signaled it was
time for the GOP race to end. He said Dole and Robertson should
``start thinking past the convention and start thinking about
November'' and the need to win the White House.
   But among the Democrats, the talk was of a brokered convention,
which Simon says is inevitable, and of the steps that some party
leaders said must be taken to prevent so publicly divisive an event
this summer.
   Simon, aglow in the winner's circle at last, said the nomination
in a deadlocked convention could easily come to him because ``I'm
probably the second choice of as many people as anyone else.''
   At the same time, he all but conceded the next big bloc of
delegates _ Michigan's 138, to be awarded in a primary March 26 _
and concentrated on another state he thought he could win,
Wisconsin, on April 5.
   Home-state voters pumped up Simon's political adrenaline with
his 43 percent showing in Tuesday's Illinois primary, against
Jackson's 31 percent, Dukakis' 17 percent and a weak 5 percent for
Albert Gore Jr. and 2 percent for Richard Gephardt. But Simon
conceded he still must prove himself.
   ``I have to win outside the Great Lakes region,'' Simon said,
``and I will.'' He flew directly to Milwaukee and told reporters,
``You are going to be seeing a lot of Paul Simon.''
   But the debate among Democrats was whether they should search
for a formula to avoid a deadlocked convention. Paul Kirk, the
Democratic national chairman, has proposed a meeting after the
primaries at which party leaders and the candidates would close
ranks around the front-runner. He said a brawl at the convention
would damage the Democrats' chances in the election.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, often pictured as the beneficiary of
a brokered convention, seconded Kirk's motion.
   ``I think it would be a mistake to go to Atlanta, have a
divisive convention, have a contention over a canddidate, have
deals cut practically in public,'' Cuomo said.
   Jackson said he would attend a post-primary season summit, but
only to talk about fair play and fair rules at the July convention.
   ``My base of support is broader than any other candidate,''
Jackson said, contending the nomination could go to him outright.
   Simon, acknowledging he won't be the front-runner, said there
was nothing wrong in the image of a convention deal selecting the
nominee.
   ``Brokered conventions produced Franklin Roosevelt, Harry
Truman, John F. Kennedy,'' he said. ``We didn't do too badly for
this country in those brokered conventions.''
   Gephardt struck an underdog posture, saying ``the odds are
against me here in Michigan.''
   ``They say I'm the underdog. I like being the underdog because
the underdog usually does well,'' he said. The Missouri congressman
said he would duplicate a campaign gimmick that drew publicity just
before Iowa's long-ago caucuses: several dozen of his House
colleagues will stump Michigan for him on Friday.

82nd Airborne to Honduras, quotes from Howard Baker that no

<TEXT>
   President Reagan said today that Nicaraguan
troops had attacked Contra rebel positions in neighboring Honduras
and officials said he is considering sending the 82nd Airborne in
response.
   A senior U.S. official said the use of the 82nd Airborne, based
in Ft. Bragg, N.C., was one of a ``few options'' being considered
by the administration to confront the new situation in Central
America.
   However, White House chief of staff Howard Baker, asked on
Capitol Hill whether any military action was being taken in Central
America, said, ``That is absolutely not true....''
   ``The president has made no decisions,'' Baker said. ``He is
identifying his options. He has not acted on them. We are keeping
very close touch with the situation. It is a fluid and developing
situation.''
   Baker and national security adviser Colin Powell briefed
congressional leaders for more than an hour on what Baker called
``an incursion'' by Sandinista forces into Honduras to eliminate
Contra supply locations in that country.
   ``It is clear the Sandinistas ... have crossed the border into
Honduras and are mounting a major offensive,'' Baker said. ``The
outcome is uncertain.''
   The White House said the president of Honduras, Jose Azcona,
asked for American assistance in trying to repel the Nicaraguan
forces, but White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he could
not say whether that request included a plea for military help.
   The Honduran ambassador put the number of Nicaraguan troops in
his country as in the thousands, but Nicaragua today strongly
denied that its soldiers had entered Honduran territory.
   ``We have never invaded Honduras and we have never invaded any
neighboring country,'' said Maj. Rosa Pasos, a Nicaragua Defense
Ministry spokeswoman. ``So we totally deny those declarations made
this morning by the White House.''
   Reagan, asked whether he was considering any use of U.S.
military forces, replied, ``We've been in consultation with the
Honduran government but I can't comment on anything.''
   He said that ``the information we have is that Nicaragua has
crossed the border into Honduras. Obviously we're concerned.''
   Speaking separatel, the Honduran ambassador, Roberto Martinez,
said that here a had been a ``penetration into Honduran territory
of a number, ... definitely in the thousands, of Sandinista troops.
   ``At this moment, we are trying the utmost to obtain a clearing
of the area, ... a total withdrawal, immediate withdrawal, of the
Sandinista troops from our territory.''
   But he said his government hoped to avoid military action.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan, his
national security adviser, the secretary of state and others ``have
conferred at length in the last 24 hours concerning the Nicaraguan
invasion of Honduran territory.''
   Fitzwater did not spell out what options were being considered,
except he did say that ``the Organization of American States will
be asked to consider the issue, and the presidents of Guatemala,
Costa Rica and El Salvador, will present their views.''
   He said the administration no longer is thinking of working with
Congress on an aid package to simply provide the resistance forces
with food, medicine, and other supplies, but not arms.
   House Speaker Jim Wright said he could not immediately evaluate
reports that Sandinista troops had crossed into Honduras.
   ``If true, that would be a very serious matter and would
introduce an element of gravity that could profoundly alter the
situation,'' including the willingness of Congress to vote for
further aid of some kind for the rebels, he told reporters.
   But Wright said he still does not believe support exists in
Congress for any kind of renewed military aid for the rebels, and
repeated that congressional Democrats remain willing to talk about
a further package of purely ``humanitarian'' aid.
   Fitzwater said that 1,500 Nicaraguan troops were inside Hondruas
and that an additional 4,500 appeared to be in a staging area to
cross the border.
   Fitzwater told reporters that ``all options are under
consideration. At this moment, everything is being considered short
of (U.S.) invasion.''
   Fitzwater commented one day after Reagan met with Democratic and
Republican congressional leaders. He failed to persuade the
Democratic leaders to get behind a new package of humanitarian aid
for the Contras.
   Congressional sources, declining to be named, said at the
meeting Reagan pounded the table and said, ``There are some people
around this table who don't seem to know who the bad guys are down
there.''
   Today, Fitzwater said, ``More than 1,500 Sandinista troops are
now inside Honduras, attacking freedom fighter camps in an effort
to destroy their remaining supplies.''
   He added:
   ``There are nearly 4,500 Sandinista forces with strong
helicopter support moving into the Bocay Valley, which is just
below the Honduran border. They've established a new base for this
operation ... .
   ``In the last several hours, the United States government has
been in contact with the presidents of the other three democratic
governments in the region,'' he said. ``We've had discussions
concerning their response to this incursion and its meaning for the
Guatemala peace plan.''
   ``The United States government today is examining its options,''
he said.
   When first word of the Sandinista operation came Monday night,
Democratic sources in Congress portrayed it as a Nicaraguan attempt
to strengthen their position in advance of cease-fire talks with
the Contras, scheduled to begin Monday.
   Today, one senior administration official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said the Sandinista drive appeared to be
aimed at a Contra camp complex and supply depot.
   If the depot is knocked out, ``there will be nothing left'' of
the Contra war effort, the source said.
   That official said that Contra commander Enrique Bermudez is in
the Bocay region and may be in ``serious trouble'' because he and
his forces are surrounded by Sandinista troops.
   Nicaragua did not report the offensive until Tuesday evening,
when a Defense Ministry spokesman said it was under way but denied
Contra claims that Sandinista troops crossed into Honduras, where
the rebels have bases.
   ``The army has undertaken major offensive operations. ...
Reports that the army has penetrated Honduras are not true,'' the
spokesman said.
   Today, however, another official of the Defense Ministry would
neither confirm nor deny that its troops had invaded Honduras.
   ``We're looking into the reports,` an officer said. ``It's
serious and that's why I can't say yes or no.'' Both Nicaraguans
would not be identified.
   The Honduran Defense Ministry said that 43 people had been
killed in the Sandinista initiative.
   Heavy fighting was reported throughout Nicaragua's 5th Military
Region, which includes Boaco, Chontales, Rio San Juan and Zelaya
South. The Contras said Sandinista troops had overrun some rebel
positions.
   Fitzwater was peppered with questions about whether the
administration was considering any use of U.S. military forces
stationed in Honduras and in nearby areas.
   ``The president has said many times that he does not plan to
introduce invasion forces in Central America,'' Fitzwater said.
``We have said in the past, and it still holds true, that we do not
plan to invade. ... That certainly hasn't changed.''
   But Fitzwater also said, ``At this moment, everything is being
considered, short of invasion.'' But later he said ``nothing is
ruled out at this point.''
   ``I'm trying to be as restrained as possible,'' the spokesman
said under intense questioning about U.S. military intentions.
``I'm telling you not to draw that signal (of direct U.S. military
involvement), but we're in the midst of discussions.''
   Fitzwater said that administration officials had consulted by
telephone late Tuesday with congressional leaders and their
representatives.

   The prosecutor in the ``preppie murder'' trial
suggested in closing statements Wednesday that the defendant
strangled a teen-age woman after a bitter Central Park argument
about his alcohol-induced impotence.
   ``Perhaps he couldn't perform because he had too many tequilas
and beers,'' Assistant District Attorney Linda Fairstein said of
21-year-old Robert Chambers.
   ``Whatever the exact words were, only two human beings know what
triggered the fight. It was an argument that escalated and became
physical,'' she said.
   Earlier, Chambers' attorney ridiculed the prosecution version of
the death of Jennifer Levin and said his client accidentally killed
her during rough sex in the park.
   ``What he was doing was reacting to the pain. He was trying to
stop her,'' lawyer Jack Litman said during his four-hour summation.
``He used force to repel the pain that was being caused to him.''
   Chambers is charged with second-degree murder. A former drug
abuser who is under indictment on burglary charges in another case,
Chambers admits he killed the victim but says it was an accident
after she attacked him sexually and hurt him.
   Fairstein repeated her charge that Chambers brutally beat and
murdered Miss Levin, 18, while in a rage in the early morning of
Aug. 26, 1986.
   ``He squeezed her neck until her young life expired in his
deadly hands. ... She struggled against death. She was in intense
pain,'' Fairstein said. ``She writhed and squirmed to free
herself.''
   Holding a photo of Miss Levin taken in a bar hours before her
death, Fairstein told the jury: ``One can't help but look at that
photograph and pray for time to stand still, for time to grab her
and say, `Don't go with Robert Chambers.'''
   Litman, in his summation, repeatedly told the jury in state
Supreme Court in Manhattan that the evidence supported Chambers'
version of the woman's death.
   Litman reminded jurors that Miss Levin had pursued Chambers in a
bar on the Upper East Side of Manhattan the night of her death
because she wanted to have sex with him. A friend of Miss Levin
testified the slain teen had said her previous encounters with
Chambers had been ``the best sex'' she ever had.
   ``That's why she pursued him, and that's why _ unfortunately _
this wound up the way it has,'' Litman said.
   To convict Chambers in the highly publicized case, ``You must
exclude to a moral certainty every inference except one of guilt _
and you can't do that,'' he said.
   ``There are 20 different explanations that are as consistent
with reality as the one they're (the prosecution) going to try to
give you,'' said Litman.
   Following the summations, the jury is to receive its
instructions in the case Thursday before beginning deliberations.

   The very authority by which independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh brought indictments Wednesday against
four major participants in the Iran-Contra affair is being
challenged in a constitutional battle before the Supreme Court.
   But a Supreme Court decision striking down the so-called special
prosecutor law would not necessarily invalidate the indictments
returned against former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter, fired White House aide Lt. Col. Oliver L. North,
retired Air Force Maj. Richard V. Secord and his business partner,
Albert Hakim.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III had given Walsh a back-up
appointment in the Justice Department in an attempt to shield the
Iran-Contra inquiry from legal attacks that the special prosecutor
law improperly takes power from the president and confers it upon
the federal judges.
   However, the status of Walsh's investigation is further blurred
because he began his work before the back-up authority was
conferred. The targets of the investigation are expected to argue
that the initial absence of the supporting authorization taints the
entire inquiry.
   The Supreme Court will hear arguments April 26 in the
constitutional challenge to the special prosecutor law. Eight
justices will decide the outcome. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy has
removed himself from consideration of the case without explanation.
A decision is expected by July.
   A panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington
ruled, 2-1, in January that the independent counsel provision of
the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 is unconstitutional.
   The law authorizes a federal court to appoint a special
prosecutor when the attorney general recommends an independent
investigation of a high-ranking administration official accused of
a crime.
   The appeals court ruling came in the investigation of former
Justice Department official Theodore B. Olson on charges he lied to
Congress.
   Alexia Morrison, the independent counsel investigating the Olson
case, appealed to the Supreme Court. Ms. Morrison did not receive
back-up authority from Meese and her investigation would be ended
if the high court declares the special prosecutor law
unconstitutional.
   Two other inquiries by independent counsels also could be
affected by the court's ruling.
   The perjury conviction of former White House aide Michael K.
Deaver could stand or fall on the outcome. The investigation that
led to the illegal lobbying conviction of former White House aide
Lyn Nofziger had back-up authority similar to that conferred in the
Iran-Contra case.

Wednesday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Production at U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2
percent in February, following a 0.3 percent January gain. It was
the fifth consecutive increase and left American industry producing
at a level 5.8 percent higher than a year ago, although the gains
are below advances registered in late 1987.
   The February increase included a 0.2 percent rise in
manufacturing, identical to January's gain. In both months, auto
assembly lines were shut down as automakers worked to reduce a high
backlog of unsold new cars.
   Auto production fell 0.9 percent in February and now stands 8.5
percent below where it was in October.

<HEAD>HOUSING STARTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction increased sharply in February, by 8.9
percent, the biggest monthly gain since a 12.7 percent rise in
December 1986.
   It follows declines of 1.9 percent in January and 15.8 percent
in December. All regions posted increases except the West, where
starts fell 9 percent.
   Many economists had predicted a housing rebound, since mortgage
rates have fallen since the first of the year and are again in the
single-digit range.

<HEAD>EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Job prospects for production and service workers are the
brightest they have been in three years but are declining slightly
for technical, professional and office workers, according to a
survey by the Bureau of National Affairs, a private publisher of
business research.
   Twenty-one percent of the 398 corporations and organizations
surveyed said they anticipate expanding production and service work
forces from April through June. A year ago 15 percent expected an
increase in hiring.
   But only 19 percent of the companies surveyed said they plan to
increase technical and professional staffs, down from 21 percent
for 1987's first quarter.

   The results of the Illinois primary were just
what the delegate counters for Democratic candidates Paul Simon and
Jesse Jackson expected, including Michael Dukakis's third-place
finish without a single delegate.
   Simon spokesman Terry Michael predicted early Tuesday that the
favorite son senator would claim 135 delegates in the
direct-election primary. Simon captured 136 of the 173 delegates at
stake.
   Steve Cobble, delegate counter for Jackson's campaign, expected
his candidate to finish with close to 40 delegates based on his
forecasts for various counties in Illinois. Jackson gained 37
delegates.
   The last-minute advertising blitz launched by Dukakis failed to
translate into delegates for the Massachusetts governor.
   ``Dukakis never made any headway,'' said Cobble. ``He had four
days of banging his head.''
   Michael, who contends that after all the primaries and caucuses
the Democrats will be ``gridlocked,'' said the Illinois results
solidify his theory of no clear winner heading into the convention.
   ``Not only does it further assure the likelihood that no one
claims a first-ballot victory on the morning of June 8, it pokes
big holes in Dukakis attempt to claim inevitability,'' Michael said.
   The last big primaries _ New Jersey and California _ are held
June 7.
   Dukakis still maintains a slight edge in total national
convention delegates, according to The Associated Press survey. The
Massachusetts governor has 464.5 delegates with Jackson second at
460.55 and Gore third with 354.8. Simon stands in fourth place with
171.5 delegates and Gephardt is fourth with 145.
   There are 272.65 uncommitted delegates.
   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush _ to no one's
surprise _ picked up 69 delegates out of the 82 at stake in
Illinois. Kansas Sen. Bob Dole finished a distant second and gained
13 delegates.
   Bush has a commanding lead in the AP delegate count with 774 of
the 1,139 needed to nominate. Dole is second with 178 delegates and
former television evangelist Pat Robertson is third with 17. There
are 72 uncommitted delegates in the Republican race.
   David Sparks, delegate counter for the Bush campaign, said the
total was slightly higher than the delegates the vice president
expected, and the campaign immediately started looking to the
future.
   ``In Puerto Rico, we have a terrific organization. In
Connecticut, that's yet another home state of George Bush and
Wisconsin has a good organization,'' Sparks said.

<HEAD>Senate Defeats Move To Make Nuclear Contractors Share Accident
Liability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected an attempt to
make private contractors at least partially liable for any future
accidents caused by negligent work at the nation's nuclear weapons
plants.
   The chamber voted 53-41 against a proposal by Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, after Senate Energy Committee Chairman Bennett
Johnston said that subjecting private contractors to potentially
huge damage claims while they are performing ``the most important
and sensitive function of this government'' would merely drive them
away from the nuclear weapons business.
   ``Rather than attracting the big companies with the reliability
and the expertise, we'd wind up with fly-by-night operators running
these plants,'' said Johnston, D-La. The Senate's vote came on
Johnston's motion to table the Metzenbaum proposal.
   Metzenbaum, citing a long list of problems in the Department of
Energy's nuclear complex, argued that ``Unless we hold the
contractors responsible, there is absolutely no incentive for them
to operate these facilities as safely as possible.''
   Most of the DOE's nuclear facilities, which produce the
components for nuclear warheads, are operated by private companies,
whose contracts total an estimated $100 billion.
   The debate over contractor liability occurred as the Senate
neared passage of a bill to renew the Price-Anderson Act, the
government's 30-year-old system of no-fault insurance covering
nuclear accidents.
   The key feature of the measure is a tenfold increase, from $700
million to $7 billion, in the maximum amount of money that would be
available for quick disbursement to victims of any single accident
involving nuclear reactors.
   In the case of nuclear utilities, each commercial reactor would
be required to continue to carry the maximum amount of private
insurance available _ about $160 million. If any given accident
cost more than that to compensate victims, the additional money _
up to $7 billion _ would be assessed equally among all 110 nuclear
plants now operating.
   Once that pool was exhausted, it would be up to Congress to
provide additional money to victims from taxpayer funds.
   The government, meanwhile, would continue to self-insure its own
nuclear plants, offering the same $7 billion maximum that could be
disbursed quickly in the wake of an accident. The system, for both
commercial and government operations, shortcuts the usual legal
requirements for damage claims by eliminating the necessity for
victims to bring individual suits in court.
   Since the legislation was first passed in 1957, DOE contractors
have been virtually absolved of any responsibility to share the
financial burden in the event of an accident at a government plant.
   The Senate did approve, 94-0, an amendment offered jointly by
Johnston and Metzenbaum which provides for stiff fines, ranging to
$100,000 per day, for violations of safety rules by DOE
contractors. Additional fines, and prison sentences ranging up to
five years, could be imposed on corporate officials who commit
``knowing and willful'' safety violations.
   But Metzenbaum fell short on his bid to have contractors share
the financial burden caused by accidents, even though, in a
last-minute bid for additional support, he watered down the
amendment to stipulate that a company could be held financially
liable for no more money than its profit on its contract at the
plant where an accident occurs.
   Johnston noted that several companies have threatened to
withdraw from bidding on future contracts unless they continued to
be exempt from liability.
   The Energy Department already has shut down one weapons
production reactor, the Hanford facility in Washington state. The
others, at the Savannah River plant in Aiken, S.C., are being run
at partial levels because of safety and environmental problems.
Dupont announced last year it will not seek to renew its contract
to run Savannah River. Westinghouse is considered a front-runner to
take over that plant.

   An Arab-American who advocates non-violent
resistance to Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip was arrested Wednesday and may be expelled, officials said.
   Mubarak Awad, 44, was charged with participating in an
anti-Israeli demonstration. Awad said he was questioned for four
hours about taking part in a women's sit-in in Isawiya, an Arab
village incorporated into Jerusalem after Israel captured the area
in 1967.
   He said he was released by city police on $2,000 bail and
ordered to appear before a judge, but no date was set for the
hearing.
   Awad, a Palestinian born in Jerusalem, is an American citizen
with homes in Jerusalem and Wapakoneta, Ohio. He was in Israel on a
three-month tourist visa that expired in November.
   Awad said he told police investigators the protest began
peacefully.
   ``The women were demonstrating with olive branches to protest
the ransacking of five houses by police. I went there, I saw the
broken furniture and smashed windows,'' Awad told The Associated
Press after his release.
   He said he left the village when police ordered him out, then
watched from a hillside as police fired tear gas to break up the
sit-in. He said Arab youths responded by throwing rocks.
   Awad said he was stopped a short time later by traffic police
for failing to signal a right turn.
   He said they ordered him detained when he was unable to present
either his Israeli identity card or his U.S. passport, which were
seized last November when Awad defied an expulsion order.
   During the questioning, ``the police mentioned expulsion. They
said it could be this time for you,'' Awad added.
   A senior government official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the charges could lead to Awad's deportation.
   ``He must be investigated. The charges against him will be
checked, according to that we will decide,'' said the official.
   ``I'm not saying he is definitely going to be expelled, but this
(investigation) may affect it. Everything depends on what the
investigation shows.''
   On Monday, Israel's Supreme Court ordered the Interior Ministry
to show within 60 days why Awad had not been expelled.
   U.S. officials have repeatedly urged Israeli officials to allow
Awad to remain.
   ``We've been in touch with him and a consular officer visited
him at the police station,'' said David Good, a spokesman for the
U.S. Consulate. ``We are following the case closely.''
   Awad came under fire after the publication in Hebrew of his book
titled ``Non-Violent Resistance: A Strategy For the Occupied
Territories.''
   The book urged the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip to refuse to pay taxes, lay down in front of bulldozers
to prevent land confiscation and boycott Israeli products.
   Although Awad has played only a minor role in the current
uprising, some of his passive resistance ideas have been adopted,
such as boycotting jobs in Israel and refusing to pay taxes.

   Gunmen on bicycles ambushed and killed
auto speed king Mickey Thompson and his wife in their driveway
Wednesday, days after he told a friend he had received several
death threats and feared for his life.
   The 59-year-old racing promoter and his wife, Trudy, 41, were
found dead at dawn, said sheriff's Deputy Doug Gatlin. Two male
assailants fled on bicycles, investigators said.
   ``It was a double homicide, an assassination,'' said Deputy
Richard Dinsmoor.
   Thompson became famous as the ``Speed King'' in the 1950s when
he set the first of his nearly 500 auto speed and endurance
records. Longtime friend Carroll Shelby described him as ``one of
the greatest hot-rodders we've ever had'' and ``the dominant figure
in off-road racing.''
   As recently as Sunday, Thompson expressed fears for his life
after receiving numerous death threats, friends and associates said.
   ``He was a little concerned,'' family friend Ernie Alvarado
said. He said he talked to Thompson early Sunday and Thompson
mentioned the death threats.
   ``I don't know why Trudy had to be involved,'' Alvarado said.
``Everybody loved her.''
   Neighbors heard six or eight shots and deputies found the bodies
about 6 a.m. in the driveway of the couple's gated, Spanish-style
estate in an area of $1 million-plus homes 20 miles from downtown
Los Angeles, investigators said.
   ``We don't know a motive,'' said Deputy Dan Cox, who wouldn't
divulge the type of weapon used. Several bullets struck each of the
Thompsons in the upper torso, he said.
   Mike Difilippo, a building contractor who lives across the
street, said he was awakened by shots.
   ``I heard yelling, `Don't shoot.' That was Trudy,'' said
Difilippo. He said Thompson had voiced concern for his life after
winning a series of multimillion-dollar lawsuits against another
racing promoter.
   Promoter and one-time partner Mike Goodwin lost a series of
lawsuits to Thompson, and Goodwin's Stadium Motorsports Corp.
assets were ordered liquidated last year by a judge to settle the
matter.
   At one point, Thompson hired a guard, Difilippo said. ``He told
me around Christmas they had threatened to kill him,'' Difilippo
said.
   The Thompsons apparently were ambushed as they were getting into
their van, Cox said. The van, its passenger window shattered,
rolled down the sloping driveway into a block wall.
   Doug Stokes, spokesman for Thompson Entertainment Group in
Anaheim, said the Thompsons were apparently leaving the house for
work when the shooting occurred. He didn't know of any threats
against Thompson.
   Thompson in 1960 became the first to travel over 400 mph on land
when he drove a four-engine streamlined car 406.6 mph at the
Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.
   He later turned to drag racing and Indianapolis car racing, and
was a top competitor in road racing and off-road championships in
the United States and Mexico.
   Thompson's other sports activities included stunt flying and
management of prizefighters.
   Racing put him in the hospital 27 times, including a seven-month
stay when he was paralyzed from the waist down after a boat racing
accident. It was two years before he walked again.

   Here is what the presidential Tower commission
and the joint congressional investigating committees said about the
four men indicted Wednesday in the Iran-Contra arms scandal: former
national security adviser John M. Poindexter, Marine Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North, and arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert
Hakim.
   The Tower commission, in its Feb. 26, 1987, report to President
Reagan, depicted North as a backstage manipulator who carried out
both the arms sale to Iran and the diversion of profits to the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua in an ``unprofessional'' manner that
invited kickbacks and scandal.
   The Tower commission said Poindexter, a vice admiral who first
was the deputy national security adviser and later held the top
post in the National Security Council, ``failed grievously'' to
consider the gravity of the diversion of proceeds from the arms
sale to the Contras.
   Poindexter ``apparently failed to appreciate or ignored the
serious legal and political risks presented,'' the Tower panel
said. ``His clear obligation was either to investigate the matter
or take it to the president _ or both. He did neither.''
   It said North ``conducted the operation through Mr. (Richard)
Secord and his associates, a network of private individuals already
involved in the Contra resupply operation.''
   ``North cut himself off from resources and expertise within the
government'' and relied on private businessmen and brokers with
``questionable credentials and potentially large personal financial
interests in the transactions. This made the transactions
unnecessarily complicated and invited kickbacks and payoffs.''
   ``The use of Mr. Secord's private network in the Iran initiative
linked those operators with the resupply of the Contras,
threatening exposure of both operations if either became public.
The result was a very unprofessional operation,'' the Tower report
said.
   The Tower panel said that on one or more occasions, Poindexter
may have misled Secretary of State George P. Shultz about the
initiative.
   The report quoted North as once saying, ``it's going to be just
fine ... as soon as everyone knows that ... the Ayatollah is
helping us with the Contras.''
   The report said North ``misrepresented his access to the
president and attributed to the president things the president
never said'' during October 1986 meetings in Frankfort, West
Germany, with Iranian representatives.
   North reportedly told the Iranians that Reagan had said he
wanted an end to the Iran-Iraq war on terms acceptable to Iran, and
that the Persian Gulf states had to be convinced Saddam Husain of
Iraq was ``causing the problem.''
   Reagan told the Tower commission those statements were
``absolute fiction.''
   The report said North once threatened the president of Costa
Rica with a cutoff of $80 million in U.S. aid if he publicized the
existence of a secret Costa Rican airfield used to resupply the
rebels.
   Secord, who retired from the Air Force as a major general in
1983 and became a private arms dealer, controlled Swiss bank
accounts under the name of Lake Resources into which $20 million in
profits from the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran were placed, the
Tower report said.
   Hakim is an Iranian immigrant and naturalized American who was
Secord's business partner in Stanford Technology Trading Group, a
Vienna, Va., company. Hakim helped open the channel of
communications to the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran.
   The House-Senate Iran-Contra committees in their report last
Nov. 18 faulted Reagan for allowing a ``cabal of zealots'' to seize
control of foreign policy and skirt the law.
   The report said that even when North became skeptical that the
arms sales would free U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon or lead
to a new relationship between the United States and Iran, ``he
believed that the prospect of generating funds for the Contras was
`an attractive incentive' for continuing the arms sales.''
   ``The decision to designate private parties _ Secord and Hakim _
to carry out the arms transactions had other ramifications,'' the
committees reported. ``First, there was virtually no accounting for
the profits from the arms deals. Even North claimed that he did not
know how Secord and Hakim actually spent the money committed to
their custody. ...
   ``Second, by permitting private parties to conduct the arms
sales, the administration risked losing control of an important
foreign policy initiative.''
   The committees determined that of the $16 million in profits
from the arms sales, $3.8 million was earmarked for the Contras
when the congressional ban on direct U.S. military aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels was in effect in 1985 and 1986.
   The congressional committees said: ``In the Iran-Contra affair,
administration officials holding no elected office repeatedly
evidenced disrespect for Congress' efforts to perform its
Constitutional oversight role in foreign policy.''
   They called North ``the central figure in the Iran-Contra
affair,'' but emphasized he ``did not act alone. ... North's
conduct had the express approval of Admiral John Poindexter.''

   Police on Tuesday occupied the campus of a
technology institute and detained a number of students suspected of
being involved in battles with villagers that left one student dead.
   Authorities barred reporters from the Rangoon Institute of
Technology in West Gyogone, seven miles north of downtown Rangoon,
following the weekend fighting.
   Burma Broadcasting Service, the government radio station, said
Tuesday the violence began at a tea shop Saturday night when
students and villagers quarreled over the playing of a cassette
tape. Five villagers were arrested, it said.
   On Sunday, larger groups of both students and villagers resumed
the fighting and some 200 students set fire to seven buildings,
according to the broadcast.
   It said police quelled the rioting with volleys of tear gas but
13 students were injured and one, Maung Phone Maw, was fatally
wounded. The report did not say how he was killed and added the
government was investigating and would take ``necessary action''
against those involved.
   A resident of West Gyogone told The Associated Press that police
and army units were seen leaving the campus Tuesday night escorting
three police vans carrying an unknown number of students.
   The witness, who spoke with the condition he not be identified,
said there was no violence as police occupied the campus and picked
up the suspects.

   Sen. Bob Dole came under increasing pressure
on Wednesday to give up his faltering presidential campaign as
Republican Party chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said it was time to
``start thinking about November.''
   A dozen of Dole's Senate supporters openly debated the merits of
his continuing a candidacy that seemed doomed to failure _ although
none of them advised Dole to get out of the race. In any event,
Dole said, ``They're not going to decide. I decide what I'm going
to do here.''
   Dole's campaign manager, William Brock, said: ``We're in
business.'' Asked for how long, he said, ``Until Bob wants to
change it.''
   With Vice President George Bush marching with seeming
inevitability toward the nomination, Dole's aides said the senator
had decided to stay in the race until the Wisconsin primary on
April 5. They said no decision has been made for beyond that date.
   Bush's aides gave the Kansas senator wide berth. ``We're
prepared to accept whatever decision Bob Dole makes,'' said Rich
Bond, the vice president's deputy campaign manager. He said Bush
was ready to match Dole dollar for dollar in any primary state
where he chooses to compete, and another spokesman said the vice
president has a $4.5 million campaign treasury at his disposal.
   The other aide, Pete Teeley, said he believes Bush will have
enough delegates to claim the nomination by the end of April or
early May in any event.
   Fahrenkopf's comments seemed a broad hint to Dole that the time
is approaching to abandon the race. He stressed his campaign
neutrality, but added that he has a responsibility as chairman ``to
ask them (the candidates chasing Bush) for some self-reflection.''
   Fahrenkopf said Dole and former television evangelist Pat
Robertson should ``start thinking past the convention and start
thinking about November'' and the general election.
   He said either of the two would have to win roughly 75 percent
of the remaining delegates at stake to have a chance at the
nomination, and he called on them to assess ``realistically'' why
they are still in the race.
   Bush has won 774 delegates in The Associated Press count,
compared with 178 for Dole and 17 for Robertson. It takes 1,139 to
win the Republican nomination at the party convention this summer.
   None of the three active candidates was campaigning during the
day. Dole was in the Senate, Bush attended to vice presidential
duties and Robertson was at home in Virginia.
   But there was an extraordinary public airing of Dole's prospects
by his supporters in the wake of Bush's Illinois primary landslide
on Tuesday.
   Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Dole's Senate colleague from
Kansas, said, ``I guess the general feeling among some of us is he
should go on through Wisconsin.''
   She added, ``If there's a way to stay in all the way and speak
to the issues ... it benefits the party and benefits him, and it
keeps the campaign on a positive level,'' she said. ``But I'm not
sure it can be done that way. Maybe it's not worth the strain of
continuing on.''
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., ``If he wants to stay in for a few
more weeks he can do it. He's staying in because he's invested
three years of his life.''
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, who told CBS News on Tuesday
that it looked ``pretty clear and convincing'' that Bush would be
the nominee, said Dole's chances are ``very very difficult, if not
impossible. But that's all right. It's not over till it's over.''
   Sen. Paul Trible, R-Va., said the meeting was of Dole's ``best
friends interested in his best interest and that of the party,''
adding: ``This is a decision for Bob Dole to make, and we will
support that decision.''
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said ``no conclusions were
drawn'' in the meeting, but ``I think there was a general
consensus, more than a general consensus, that now the campaign
ought to go forward.''
   ``I believe that he should stay in,'' Grassley said, adding that
at the meeting, there was ``absolutely not'' anyone urging Dole to
get out.
   Grassley said Wednesday's Iran-Contra indictments were not
discussed in the meeting, but said: ``There's going to be some
Reagan baggage that George Bush has to contend with.''
   That view was echoed by Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., who was
not at the meeting but advised Dole to stay in the race. ``George
can't duck the (Iran-Contra) issue,'' he said.
   Dole said his colleagues were `'very friendly, very positive,
very upbeat, saying, `hang in there.''' Bush's aides were careful
not to gloat, but said it was as good as over.
   Teeley said Dole's ``got to do what's best for him.'' But he
added that Connecticut, which holds the next GOP primary on March
29, ``is going to be a very strong state for us, there's no
question about it.''
   Bush enjoys the support of several Republican elected officials
in the state. Sen. Lowell Weicker, nominally neutral in the
presidential race, is writing a newspaper article praising the vice
president and is considering a formal endorsement at a Bush
campaign function being planned for a few days before the primary,
sources said.
   Beyond that, Teeley said Bush is in a strong position in
primaries in Wisconsin, New York and Pennsylvania. He said he
believes the vice president will clinch the delegates needed for
the nomination either on April 26 when Pennsylvania votes or a week
later, with primaries in Ohio and Indiana.
   Robertson, who met with Republican Party chairman Fahrenkopf on
Tuesday, says he won't compete in either Connecitcut or Wisconsin,
but will concentrate his efforts in caucus states. Robertson says
he is now concentrating on expanding his political base for the
1992 campaign.
   Fahrenkopf said Robertson indicated in the meeting that he
intends to remain a candidate until the nominating convention.

<HEAD>Dukakis Health Care Bill Shaped By Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' highly touted universal
health care plan has been streamlined since it was raised a year
ago, its deadlines extended, its bureaucracy reduced and its
funding expanded by millions of dollars.
   But the proposal's basic premise, making Massachusetts the first
state to guarantee health insurance protection for all its
residents, remains intact.
   The plan, which Dukakis has held up as an example to the nation
in his Democratic presidential campaign, awaits final action by a
legislative conference committee.
   Senate Ways and Means Chairman Patricia McGovern, the chief
architect of the bill, said Wednesday the House and Senate
proposals are so similar that ``there are no major sticking
points'' that would prevent passage.
   Universal health care in Massachusetts first came to the
attention of the Legislature in a position paper issued by McGovern
in February 1987.
   ``In my wildest dreams, I didn't think a year later we'd be
almost on the verge of accomplishing it,'' she said. ``I thought it
would take much, much longer.''
   Dukakis wasn't an initial supporter of universal health care,
considering it too costly. In his original proposal in August, the
governor did not suggest any state spending for the plan,
maintaining that employers should shoulder the cost.
   McGovern is credited with getting the governor to support the
present plan, which would phase in health care until all residents
are insured by 1992.
   The present plan retains Dukakis' proposed unemployment
surcharge tax on employers who don't provide coverage by 1992. But
it also contains a state commitment of $500 million or more over
the next four years to make sure everyone is covered.
   The governor has taken the issue on the campaign trail, talking
as much about the 600,000 uninsured in Massachusetts as the 40
million uninsured nationally.
   Only Hawaii has anything comparable to what's been proposed in
Massachusetts. The state has required employers to provide workers
with insurance coverage since the early 1970s.
   The federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act was passed
after Hawaii's law took effect to prevent other states from
imposing similar mandates on employers, and questions remain about
how Massachusetts' proposal will fare under federal review.
   Massachusetts' small businesses lobbied hard and successfully
against Dukakis' bill last year.
   This year, although some small business groups still oppose it,
the measure has been reshaped to reflect their concerns.
   State-brokered pooled insurance for small employers was added.
So were tax breaks and a ``hardship trust fund'' in which the state
agrees to help employers pay insurance costs that exceed 5 percent
of their revenues.
   The House also passed an amendment exempting employers of nine
or fewer workers from the 1992 deadline for providing employee
coverage. The Senate version has no such exemption, and the issue
is expected to be a focal point of the conferee negotiations.
   Other major changes since Dukakis first proposed the bill
include allowing more time to put the system into effect and
scrapping a plan to create a ``super agency'' to oversee the
universal health care system.

   Iran and Iraq blasted each other's
capitals with missiles, hammered other cities with air raids, and
fought ground battles along the front Wednesday.
   The U.N. Security Council called for an end to the carnage.
   Hundreds were reported killed in the air and ground exchanges,
the latest in more than two weeks of almost daily attacks on the
two nations' heaviest population centers.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iran's
Revolutionary Guards fired five missiles into the Iraqi capital of
Baghad after 70 Iranian civilians were killed in Iraqi missile
attacks on Tehran and warplane raids on seven Iranian cities.
   The state-run Iraqi News Agency confirmed only three hits on
Baghdad and said ``many civilians were killed or wounded.'' The
agency, also monitored in Nicosia, did not give a casualty count
but reported seven missiles fired at Tehran.
   Iran confirmed that missiles hit the capital and said Iraqi
warplanes bombed Bakhtaran, Shiraz and other cities in western
Iran. The Iranian agency said 25 civilians were killed and more
than 100 wounded in Shiraz alone.
   Iraq says it has fired 22 surface-to-surface missiles into the
Iranian capital since a two-day truce in the so-called ``war of the
cities'' broke down late Sunday. Iran has reported launching seven
into Baghdad.
   The Iranian agency also said Revolutionary Guards pushed into
Sulaymaniyah province in northeastern Iraq and seized 95 square
miles, including 21 villages, in heavy battles with Iraqi troops.
   It said more than 3,100 Iraqis were killed or wounded and 800
taken prisoner in the fighting in the mountainous region, 160 miles
north of Baghdad.
   The agency said Iranian troops were in control of the town of
Khurmal, near the border, and that the residents in the
``liberated'' area ``warmly welcomed the attacking Iranian
combatants.''
   In Switzerland, the newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung quoted
Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammed Hussein Malaek as saying his
country had cut all ties to the Security Council.
   Malaek also was quoted as saying only a military solution could
end the Persian Gulf war, and that Iran no longer felt obligated to
respect international conventions which are supposed to protect
civilians and prisoners in wartime and ban the use of chemical
weapons.
   The U.N. Security Council, meanwhile, demanded an end to the
missile attacks on Baghdad and Tehran. It also endorsed another
round of negotiations by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
on implementing the council's July 20 cease-fire resolution and
peace plan for the 7{-year-old war.
   A statement issued by the council president said the 15 nations
on the panel ``strongly deplore the escalation of hostilities
between these two countries, particularly the attacks against
civilian targets and cities ...''
   A presidential statement is the mildest form of council action.
It falls short of the resolution and the appointment of a special
negotiator the Soviet Union had been seeking.
   The United States said the Soviet idea would divert attention
from the July resolution. The resolution demands an immediate
cease-fire and withdrawal to international boundaries as the first
steps for negotiating an end to the war.
   Iran's news agency said jet fighters bombed the northern Iraqi
city of Kirkuk and other cities, ``inflicting heavy casualties and
losses on the enemy.''
   The Iraqi agency reported that warplanes Tuesday raided a
``large maritime target,'' a reference to an oil tanker, that
night. Gulf-based marine executives had reported a raid on the
Liberian-flagged Trade Fortitude at around the same time.

   Lt. Col. Oliver North, his face drawn and
gray, his voice breaking, said Wednesday he was caught in the
cross-fire of a bitter dispute between Congress and the president
and that ``it is a shame the new battleground for such a fight will
be in a courtroom.''
   The Marine officer talked to reporters a few hours after a
federal grand jury indicted him and three others on conspiracy
charges.
   ``I did not commit any crime. I intend to fight allegations of
wrongdoing for as long as necessary,'' said North. He said the
fight will entail enormous costs, personal and financial, but
``nevertheless, I can assure you, I will never give up, we will
win.''
   North's eyes clouded and his voice quavered as he thanked the
American people ``who have shown so much love and concern these
past 16 months by their millions of telegrams and letters and
prayers and support.''
   Beside him was his lawyer, Brendan Sullivan, who also
represented North at last summer's hearings before joint committees
of the Senate and House. Sullivan, whose spirited defense of his
client was one of the highlights of the hearings, said that seeking
Wednesday's indictment ``was one of the worst prosecutorial
decisions in the history of our country.
   ``It is a decision of an unaccountable prosecutor who came to
Washington determined to allege that some crime, any crime had been
committed,'' Sullivan said.
   Sullivan added that Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent counsel
``presents an indictment after 15 months (of investigation) based
on mistaken facts, novel and sometimes ridiculous legal theories.
   ``The return of an indictment under these circumstances
presented here is an abuse of the criminal process,'' Sullivan
said. ``Everyone must seriously wonder about a decision to indict a
man like Oliver North, a highly decorated Marine Corps officer,
based on his tireless effort in the interests of his country.''
   For his part, North said it was a sad irony that the decision to
indict should occur on the fourth anniversary of the abduction in
Lebanon of William Buckley and the third anniversary of the
kidnapping of Terry Anderson, The Associated Press' Middle East
correspondent.
   ``The indictment is also sad for our country,'' North said. He
said that as a Marine officer he had always done his best.
   ``Unfortunately, I have now been caught in a bitter dispute
between the Congress and the president over the control of foreign
policy, the power of the president to deter communism in Central
America and the president's duty to protect our citizens against
terrorist acts abroad,'' North said.
   ``It is a shame that the new battleground for such a fight will
be a courtroom,'' North said.
   After he read his statement, North turned to leave. A reporter
asked ``who authorized you to conduct U.S. foreign policy?''
   ``I'm not going to take any questions,'' said North.

<HEAD>Separated Siamese Twin Chokes On Formula, May Have Suffered Brain
Damage</HEAD>

   Separated Siamese twin Patrick Binder may have
suffered new brain damage after choking during a routine feeding,
Johns Hopkins Hospital said Tuesday.
   Patrick had been left unattended briefly late Sunday afternoon
when he choked on formula fed to him through a nasal tube,
according to Lisa Hillman, spokeswoman for the Hopkins Children's
Center. Since then, he has had some seizures, she said.
   A nurse making a routine check on the room Patrick shares with
his brother Benjamin, found he had stopped breathing, called for
emergency help and began mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
   Patrick was rushed to the pediatric intensive care unit, where a
ventilator was attached to mechanically aid his breathing.
   The child awakened an hour later, an indication that his
breathing had not stopped for very long, Ms. Hillman said.
   Doctors believe ``there may be some damage,'' Ms. Hillman said,
because ``he has had, since the incident, some mild seizures.'' She
described them as ``jerking movements of the face'' and said they
had been stopped by medication.
   The twins had been doing well since surgery last month to
implant titanium mesh plates in the opening at the back of their
heads, created by a complex, marathon operation last September to
separate their joined skulls.
   Doctors said both boys sustained slight brain damage during the
separation procedure, and the long-term effects remain uncertain.
   Benjamin remained in good condition Tuesday, while Patrick was
listed in stable condition and showing slight improvement in the
intensive care unit.
   Doctors had hoped the 13-month-old twins would be going home to
Ulm, West Germany, by the end of March, but Ms. Hillman said
Patrick's setback could cause a delay.

   Investigators Wednesday were
trying to determine when and where the USS John Hancock's
disbursement officer was strangled, shot and robbed of the ship's
payroll, a Navy spokesman said.
   The body of Lt. Ratish Prasad, 24, was found Tuesday inside a
locker on the destroyer. About $94,000 was missing from his office
safe, the Navy said, revising the amount downward from Tuesday's
estimate of $120,000.
   ``He was shot at close range, and also strangled,'' said Chief
Petty Officer Art Riccio.
   There was no indication Prasad also was bludgeoned, as first
reports indicated, Riccio said. ``With all the blood and
everything, that's the way it looked,'' Riccio said. ``The bullet
apparently passed right through the head.''
   Final autopsy reports have not been released, Riccio said.
   The time of death and where Prasad was shot had not been
determined, Navy officials said. No bullets or casings were found,
and the caliber of the weapon was not known, Riccio said.
   Riccio said the twice-monthly payroll, due for disbursement
Tuesday, was $70,000, and about $20,000 in cash usually is kept in
the safe.
   No information was available on suspects from Navy Investigative
Service officers working with Duval-Jacksonville sheriff's
deputies, Riccio said.
   People trying to board the destroyer or other Navy ships must
pass checkpoints at the base entrance, the pier area and the ship
itself, Riccio said.
   Only family members and friends of the crew who have been
previously cleared are allowed aboard the ship in port, he said.
Even Naval personnel who do not have business on the ships cannot
board, he said.
   Prasad, who was single and came from Park Forest, Ill., had
enlisted three years ago.
   Lt. Cmdr. Tim Taylor said Prasad normally would have been met at
his office about 8 a.m. by an armed master at arms, a member of the
ship's security force. Prasad himself normally would not have been
armed, Taylor said.
   Prasad and the master at arms then would have gone to the
officer's quarters, chiefs' quarters, then crew messes to pay crew
members, Taylor said.
   When the disbursing office door was discovered open, a search
was mounted for Prasad, who had gotten off duty at midnight then
spent the night on board, Taylor said.
   Prasad's body was found in an isolated storage area one deck
below his office, Taylor said.

   The White House remained silent Wednesday on
the question of whether President Reagan would pardon key figures
indicted by a federal grand jury for their involvement in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Under the Constitution, a president holds immense power when it
comes to granting pardons. The question now looms whether Reagan
will choose to use it.
   On Wednesday, a federal grand jury indicted Reagan's former
national security adviser, John M. Poindexter, along with fired
White House aide Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and two arms dealers on
conspiracy charges in the diversion of Iranian arms sales profits
to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan was informed
of the indictments by Kenneth Duberstein, his deputy chief of
staff. Speaking of Reagan, Fitzwater said, ``He had no response.''
He said there was no White House comment because ``it's a matter
before the courts.''
   Since the Iran-Contra scandal erupted in November 1986, Reagan
has refused _ in public at least _ to entertain any discussion of
pardons.
   ``This is a subject I have not and will not discuss at this
time,'' Reagan said last November.
   Reporters tried _ at least four times that day _ to persuade him
to discuss it, but Reagan repeatedly refused to do so.
   In the intervening months, Reagan has been careful not to rule
out the option.
   He has made it clear _ particularly in his description of North
as an ``American hero'' _ that he is giving the former National
Security Council aide the benefit of the doubt.
   ``I'm going to wait until he's had his day in court,'' Reagan
said last summer when queried about North's testimony before the
joint congressional committees investigating the matter. Reagan
added that he was ``not going to pre-judge'' North based on his
televised appearances before the committees.
   And after Congress completed its investigation, Reagan said in a
national broadcast that he thought North and Poindexter ``believed
they were doing what I would've wanted done.''
   Although contending he was as ``mad as a hornet'' about the
damage inflicted on his administration, the president has never
criticized his aides for lying to Congress, shredding documents or
participating in a cover-up.
   Reagan, questioned at one time about the series of laws in 1985
and 1986 barring direct or indirect military aid to the Contras,
responded: ``I don't think that the law was broken.''
   In fact, if Reagan choses to grant pardons to anyone connected
with the affair, he would not have to list a specific crime that is
being pardoned.
   Such sweeping power amounts to a legal grant of absolution,
enshrined in the Constitution. The Founding Fathers borrowed the
concept from English common law.
   It allows a president virtually unlimited authority covering
``offenses against the United States, except in cases of
impeachment.''
   ``He's really very free,'' said C. Thomas Dienes, a professor of
constutional law at George Washington University.
   A president is able to grant a pardon involving a federal crime
solely on his own initiative _ he need not consult anyone or even
wait for an indictment or conviction before taking action, Dienes
said.
   Dienes cited an 1867 Supreme Court case, Ex Parte Garland, which
states the effect of such a presidential decision: ``In the eye of
the law, the offender is as innocent as if he never committed the
offense.''
   During his nearly eight years in office, Reagan has granted 333
pardons out of 1,894 requests, according to the Justice Department.
   Normally, the process begins with a four-page application
submitted to the Justice Department's pardon attorney. Since
virtually all the applicants have been convicted of crimes, the
department's guidelines require that applicants wait five years to
seven years after the completion of their sentences.
   But presidents are allowed under the Constitution to avoid that
route.
   Two months into his first term, Reagan ignored the formal
procedure and granted pardons to two former FBI officials convicted
of sanctioning warrantless break-ins.
   That was the path President Ford took to pardon Richard Nixon on
Sept. 8, 1974, for any wrongdoing connected with the Watergate
scandal.
   Ford's pre-emptive pardon sent his popularity ratings into a
tumble. It also contributed to his loss of the 1976 elections.
   Although Reagan is barred from running again, his decision in
this case could affect Vice President George Bush's chances in the
presidential election this fall and those of other GOP candidates,
according to Stephen Hess, a senior fellow and specialist in
presidential affairs at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
   Hess predicted that if Reagan decided to pardon any Iran-Contra
figures, he would wait until after the November elections.
   ``Since Ford's action cost him the election, I doubt we'll see
Reagan move before November,'' Hess said.
   He added: ``I would be stunned if there isn't a pardon between
election day and January 1989. As outgoing president, Reagan is in
the best position to take the heat.''

<TEXT>
   Protests that began months ago with
allegations of criminal conduct by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega have
turned into public rage over unpaid salaries in an economy without
money.
   The largest demonstrations in nine months of turmoil,
accompanied by strikes, took place Wednesday. They started at about
10 a.m. and riot squads managed to disperse the crowds by
mid-afternoon. By early evening the streets were deserted except
for police patrols.
   People were reported injured, but there were no confirmed
figures. There were reports of widespread looting and several
stores were set ablaze.
   Noriega, who rules Panama as chief of the 15,000-member Defense
Forces _ the military and police _ has been indicted in Florida on
narcotics charges and President Reagan said Tuesday he wants the
general ``out of there.''
   Economic pressure applied by the United States includes a freeze
on Panamanian government accounts in U.S. banks and withholding
Panama Canal revenues. This has dried up the supply of U.S.
dollars, Panama's national currncy.
   Wednesday's protests began soon after young officers led by
Police Chief Leonidas Macias mounted an unsuccessful coup.
   Shops and other businesses closed early. Reporters saw
protesters at a barricade stop and open a refrigerated truck and
empty it of frozen chickens.
   Electric power went off throughout the country at about midday,
soon after workers of the National Power Company walked out to
protest not being paid.
   Government workers were sent home after waiting all morning for
biweekly paychecks that did not arrive.
   Public transportation stopped because employees were not paid.
   In lower-income neighborhoods, burning barricades appeared at
street corners. Many protesters identified themselves as
``civilistas'' _ members of the National Civic Crusade, a coaliton
of about 200 business, professional, labor, student and opposition
groups.
   The Crusade was formed last June, after the first reports that
Noriega was involved in drug dealing, corruption and allegedly even
political murder. Its stated purpose was to force him out.
   Protesters at many street corners Wednesday stoned the few buses
that were running and any cars suspected of being from the
government. Those carrying journalists were allowed to pass.
   ``It is time for the gringos to come in,'' a demonstrator
shouted at a carload of reporters, using the slang for North
Americans.
   Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra, a Crusade leader, said: ``The
fight will intensify tomorrow.''
   One large group of protesters was made up of health workers from
Social Security hospitals. They yelled that they have not been paid
and many fought riot police with rocks and sticks.
   Soldiers went to Social Security institutions Wednesday morning
and disarmed hospital security guards, also members of the Defense
Forces.
   ``They probably do not want the people to take the guards' guns
away,'' a hospital employee said.
   A nurse said of Noriega: ``He must go. Look what he is doing to
this country.''

   The second late-winter storm in a week dumped up to a foot of
snow in mountain areas of Utah, Wyoming and Colorado on Wednesday
and moved into the Plains states, while record cold gripped the
Southeast.
   A winter storm warning was posted in northwestern Kansas, and
storm watches went up in parts of Texas, Missouri and Oklahoma. Up
to 8 inches of snow were forecast for parts of Kansas and Missouri.
   The wintry weather comes on the heels of a storm that brought
heavy snow to the area last weekend.
   Parts of Utah and western Colorado got heavy snow Wednesday
morning, with more than a foot at Fillmore and Clear Creek Canyon,
in central Utah, 10 inches at Lander, Wyo., about 4 inches at Red
Mountain Pass, Colo., and Colorado Springs, Colo., and 2 inches at
Goodland, Kans.
   Blowing snow cut visibility at Laramie, Wyo., to an eighth of a
mile.
   Heavier snowfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 5 inches at Roosevelt, Utah, 4 inches at Goodland, Kans.,
and Milford, Utah, and 2 inches at Russell, Kans.
   Record lows were set in 18 cities in the Southeast on Wednesday
morning, including Apalachicola, Fla., 31; Calico Rock, Ark., 16;
Charleston, S.C., 28; El Dorado, Ark., 26; Greer, S.C., 25;
Hollywood, Fla., 44; Hot Springs, Ark., 25; Key West, Fla., 55;
Meridian, Miss., 23; Miami, 44; Miami Beach, 45; Mobile, Ala., 30;
New Orleans, 38; Tallahassee, Fla., 24, and West Palm Beach, Fla.,
43.
   A frost and freeze warning was in effect overnight for South
Carolina.
   Rain dampened south-central and southeast Texas, and scattered
light rain was reported in the Texas Panhandle and southwest
Oklahoma.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 0.38 inch at Corpus Christi, Texas; 0.31 inch at Alice,
Texas; 0.30 inch at Palacios, Texas, and 0.26 inch at Corpus
Christi, Texas.
   Snowshowers occurred from Vermont across much of New York,
western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio to the mountains of West
Virginia.
   Temperatures at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 16 degrees at Limon,
Colo., to 72 degrees at Wink, Texas, and Palm Springs, Calif. The
nation's morning low was 12 degrees below zero at West Yellowstone,
Mont.
   Temperatures dropped to near freezing Wednesday morning in the
Pacific Northwest, where Yakima, Wash., tied a record low of 23
degrees.
   Thursday's forecast called for snow from southern Michigan
across the middle Mississippi Valley, Kansas and much of Oklahoma
to parts of northwest Texas; rain mixed with snow from the lower
Ohio Valley across southeast Missouri and northwest Arkansas to
eastern Oklahoma; rain across portions of the lower Mississippi
Valley and much of Texas, and thunderstorms scattered over southern
and eastern Texas.
   High temperatures should reach the upper 20s or 30s from
northern New England to New York and from Michigan across the upper
half of the Mississippi Valley and all of the Great Plains to the
central Rockies, the 60s or 70s from the south Atlantic Coast
across the Gulf Coast to southern Texas and from the desert
Southwest to the pacific Northwest, and the 40s or 50s elsewhere.

   President Reagan's former national security
adviser, John M. Poindexter, and fired White House aide Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North were indicted Wednesday along with two arms dealers
on charges they conspired to divert Iranian arms sales profits to
the Nicaraguan Contras.
   The long-awaited 23-count indictment, which also named retired
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and his business partner,
Albert Hakim, said the four men ``deceitfully and without legal
authorization'' organized, directed and concealed ``a program to
continue funding of and logistical and other support for military
and paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by the Contras'' at a time
U.S. law barred such action.
   The indictment charged that proceeds from the the $30 million
worth of U.S. arms sales to Iran were diverted illegally to foreign
bank accounts controlled by Secord and Hakim for their personal
financial gain.
   Only $12.2 million from the arms sales was turned over to the
U.S. government, according to the indictment.
   Hakim and Secord also were charged with conspiring to pay
illegal gratuities to North by arranging the installation of a
security system at the Marine officer's home and by creating a
$200,000 fund for his family in a Swiss bank.
   Outside the U.S. Courthouse, Iran-Contra independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh told reporters the investigation was continuing
but declined to say whether there would be any more criminal
charges brought in the case.
   ``The grand jury is not finished,'' Walsh said. ``This is simply
an interim report.''
   North, who was fired from his job as a National Security Council
aide in late 1986, said: ``I did not commit any crime. I intend to
fight the allegations of wrongdoing for as long as necessary.''
   His voice breaking, North said the months ahead will be
difficult. But, he added: ``Nonetheless, I can asure you, I will
never give up, we will win, I just cannot tell you how soon.''
   North's attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., told repoorters it
will be necessary to call high-ranking officials to North's trial.
   Sullivan said the indictment was an abuse of the criminal
process and said a criminal court is not the place to solve a
dispute between the president and Congress.
   ``It is mind-boggling to consider a protracted trial,'' Sullivan
said.
   A secretary in Secord's office said he was out of town and had
not commented on the indictment.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan was informed
of the indictments by Kenneth Duberstein, his deputy chief of
staff. Speaking of Reagan, Fitzwater said, ``He had no response.''
He said there was no White House comment because ``it's a matter
before the courts.''
   Just hours before the indictment, Reagan was asked if he still
stood by his assertion that no laws were broken in the Iran-Contra
affair. ``I have no knowledge of anything that was broken,'' he
replied.
   Asked why he felt that way, he replied, ``because from all of
the investigation and everything else, we don't know where that
money came from and we don't know who had it and we don't know
where it went. All I know was that we got the purchase price we had
asked for.''
   But the indictment, among other things, charged that North and
Secord conspired to divert millions of dollars from the sale of
U.S. government arms to the alleged ``Enterprise.''
   Among other things the indictment charged that North persuaded
the CIA to lower its price from $6,000 to $3,469 for each of the
1,000 TOW missiles sold to Iran in February 1986 even though the
Iranians were paying $10,000 apiece.
   As a result, the ``Enterprise'' kept more than $6 million and
turned over only $3.7 million to the U.S. government, the
indictment said.
   In May 1986, only $6.5 million of the $15 million that Iran paid
for spare Hawk missile parts was turned over to the U.S.
government, leaving nearly $8.5 million for the ``Enterprise,'' the
indictment said.
   The indictment culminated a 14-month grand jury investigation
into the arms-for-hostages deals with Iran and the diversion of
nearly $4 million in profits to the Contras.
   All four defendants were charged with conspiracy to defraud the
government and commit criminal offenses against it, theft of
government property and wire fraud arising from the diversion of
arms-sale proceeds.
   The these charges together carry maximum penalties of 25 years
imprisonment. Each of the three charges carries a potential
$250,000 fine.
   North was named in nine counts charging him with obstruction of
Congress, making false statements, obstructing Attorney General
Edwin Meese III's Nov. 21-23, 1986, inquiry by making false
statements and concealing, falsifying and destroying classified
government documents in NSC files.
   Meese's weekend inquiry uncovered the diversion of arms-sale
profits and led to Poindexter's resignation and North's dismissal
from the NSC staff.

   Poindexter was named in two counts of obstructing a
congressional inquiry and two other counts of false statements.
   Poindexter was accused of lying to the House and Senate
intelligence committees on Nov. 21, 1986, by saying he did not
learn about the November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran
until three months later.
   The indictment also charges that Poindexter, a computer buff,
deleted from the NSC computer system all stored messages that he
had sent or received.
   Poindexter and North are also charged with lying to House
committees in the summer of 1986 by falsely stating that North was
not helping raise money for the Contras or providing military
advice to the rebels.
   The obstruction and false statement charges against North and
Poindexter each carry five-year sentences and a $250,000 fine.
   After a full day of deliberations, Walsh was called to the grand
jury room at 3:54 p.m. and told the panel was ready to return an
indictment. The 21 members of the grand jury then filed upstairs to
a courtroom where the 101-page indictment was formally returned to
U.S. Magistrate Jean Dwyer.
   The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell, 77,
who was appointed by President Johnson and presided over one of the
Watergate trials.
   Last week, Poindexter's predecessor as national security
adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor
charges that he withheld information from Congress in 1985 and in
1986 by denying that members of his staff, particularly North, were
helping raise private money to arm the Contras during the Contra
aid ban.
   The indictment also charged North with obstructing the
independent counsel's investigation of the security system at his
Great Falls, Va., home by creating false documents to conceal the
fact that Secord had paid $16,000 for it installation. He was
charged with illegally accepting the security system as a gratuity.
   The indictment also charged that North pocketed $4,500 of
$90,000 in travelers checks that he received from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero to cover expenses related to the rebel cause and the
efforts to obtain release U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   In a statement, Hakim's lawyer, N. Richard Janis, said: ``We
believe strongly that Mr. Hakim has committed no crimes and that
ths indictment is unfair and unwarranted.''
   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, who chaired the Senate
Iran-Contra committee, said, he believed ``justice will ultimately
be done.''
   ``While I personally remain convinced that they exhibited
insufficient sensitivity to the rule of law, and to the fact that
under our system of government the Congress makes the laws, we must
await the verdict of a jury of their peers as to whether this
insensitivity was criminal in nature,'' Inouye said.
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, another member of the Senate panel
who was one of the administration's strongest supporters during the
congressional hearings, said the investigation was ``a colossal
embarrassment to our whole government.''
   ``It's going to be a very tricky trial to try to prove these
charges in an open forum,'' Hatch told reporters.
   ``I'm not white-washing this. There were serious mistakes made
here,'' Hatch said.
   Last spring, two conservative fund-raisers, Carl R. ``Spitz''
Channell and Richard Miller, pleaded guilty to felony charges that
they conspired with North to illegally use a tax-exempt foundation
to raise $3.2 million for the Contras.
   The indictment also charged North with participating in that
conspiracy.

   The Security Council unanimously urged
South Africa on Wednesday to commute the sentences of the
``Sharpeville Six,'' sentenced to be executed for a 1984 death by
mob violence.
   Its resolution asked for a stay of the executions, scheduled for
Friday, and said South Africa's ``practice'' of executing opponents
of apartheid has harmed the search for peace.
   On Tuesday, President Reagan issued a personal appeal for the
lives of the six.
   They were convicted in the 1984 mob killing of a black township
councilman stoned and burned to death in the Sharpeville township
south of Johannesburg. An appeals court judge ruled that they did
not kill him personally but had common purpose with the mob.
   Dragoslav Pejic of Yugoslavia, Security Council president for
March, said death sentences for the ``African patriots'' had caused
``undivided international condemnation and uproar.'' He also said
thousands of innocent black South Africans have been detained and
tortured.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar sent a telegram to
President P.W. Botha of South Africa asking mercy be shown the five
men and one woman on humanitarian grounds.
   He said clemency would help reduce tensions in South Africa,
where 5 million whites control the government and the 26 million
blacks have no voice in national affairs.
   The council resolution spoke of the ``Pretoria racist regime's
decision to execute the Sharpeville Six ... in defiance of
worldwide appeals.''
   Ambassador A. Leslie Manley of South Africa issued a statement
criticizing the council, which frequently condemns his country.
   He said the government ``strongly objects'' to council action
that interferes ``not only in an internal South African matter but
also a matter which is the result of the due process of law.''
   South Africa ``is not insensitive to the feelings aroused by
capital punishment but must respect the independence of the
country's judicial system,'' his statement said. ``Murder is a
common law crime. It has nothing to do with the color of a person's
skin.''
   It said South African courts ``are highly respected'' and that
there are few countries ``if any, where the courts enjoy a higher
degree of independence from the executive authority.''
   This was the council's second action in a week of a resolution
condemning apartheid, the official South African policy of race
discrimination. Last Tuesday, the United States and Britain vetoed
a resolution that would have imposed economic sanctions.
   Wednesday's resolution said the executions would ``further
inflame an already grave situation in South Africa.''
   It urged South Africa to commute the sentences and asked all
countries and organizations to ``use influence and take urgent
measures to save the lives of the `Sharpeville Six'.''
   The United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and China are
permanent members of the council, with veto power. Other nations
currently serving are Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Japan,
Nepal, Senegal, West Germany, Yugoslavia and Zambia.

   A Japanese sound expert testified
Wednesday that tape-recordings show President Corazon Aquino's
husband was killed on an airport stairway in 1983 by a gun other
than previously claimed, and that soldiers shouted ``Let me do it!''
   Matsumi Suzuki, president of Japan Acoustics Institute of Tokyo,
testified at the trial of 34 soldiers and three civilians accused
of murdering former Sen. Benigno Aquino and Rolando Galman, a
purported communist agent originally accused as Aquino's assassin.
   Aquino's murder led to a groundswell of opposition to
then-President Ferdinand E. Marcos that culminated in a February
1986 popular revolt which deposed Marcos after 20 years in office
and swept Mrs. Aquino to power.
   Suzuki identified four soldiers as the ones who shouted ``This
is it!,'' ``Let me do it!'' and ``Shoot, shoot!'' seconds before
Aquino was murdered at Manila airport on Aug. 21, 1983. He said the
soldiers shouted in Tagalog, the main Filipino language.
   Aquino was shot as he left a China Airlines flight under
military escort on his return from three years self-exile in
America to lead the opposition to Marcos. The soldiers shot Galman
on the tarmac seconds after Aquino fell.
   Suzuki, speaking in Japanese through an interpreter, said he
analyzed sounds picked up by journalists' tape-recorders during the
assassination and from test-firing various types of guns in
Japanese and U.S. studios.
   Chief prosecutor Raul Gonzales later told reporters Suzuki's
testimony supports the prosecution's claim that Aquino was killed
on the stairway, where only soldiers were in a position to shoot
him in the back of the head.
   The Marcos government claimed Galman shot Aquino on the tarmac
with a .357-caliber Magnum.
   Suzuki said his analysis of tape-recordings show the first shot,
which has been established as the one that killed Aquino, could
have come only from a .45-caliber pistol.
   He said the sound of the footsteps of Aquino and his four
soldier escorts were clearly picked up by two boom microphones
extended over the top of the 21-step stairway as the party began
descending.
   ``We can clearly analyze the sound of the first step to the 11th
step,'' he said. ``After the 11th step ... the sound of gunfire was
heard.''
   The tapes picked up the words ``Eto na'' (This is it), followed
by ``Ako na. Ako na'' (Let me do it. Let me do it) and ``Pusila.
Pusila.'' (Shoot. Shoot.)
   Suzuki said that from a study of voice prints, he concluded the
words ``Eto na'' were shouted by Lt. Jesus de Castro, chief of the
security detail who remained at the stop of the stairs while Aquino
was led down.
   The words ``let me do it'' were spoken by Sgts. Claro Lat and
Arnulfo de Mesa one after the other, he said.
   Suzuki said the fatal shot came after both Castro and Constable
1st Class Mario Lazaga shouted ``shoot'' one after the other.
   Defense Lawyer Rodoldo Jimenez objected that ``voice analysis is
not an exact science.''
   But Suzuki and Gonzalez claimed that like fingerprints, a voice
print is unique and cannot be duplicated.
   Judge Regino Hermosisima, one of the three judges trying the
case, said the court was accepting Suzuki's testimony as ``part of
the evidence although this is not an exact science.''
   An earlier trial acquitted 25 soldiers and one civilian
implicated in the Aquino-Galman murders. But soon after Mrs. Aquino
became president, the Supreme Court ruled Marcos had influenced the
decision and ordered a retrial.

<HEAD>Tutu Cancels Meeting With Dutch Reformed Church Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu on Wednesday canceled a meeting with leaders of the
white Dutch Reformed Church after they described his challenge of
government policy as ``impious.''
   Tutu, a prominent foe of apartheid and winner of the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize, had planned to meet the leaders in Pretoria Thursday
for the first formal talks between the two churches since 1960.
President P.W. Botha and most other government officials belong to
the Dutch Reformed Church, the largest denomination of the dominant
Afrikaner white minority.
   Tutu said he canceled the meeting because of an ``abusive
attack'' on his church in a statement issued Tuesday by Dutch
Reformed leaders and published Wednesday. He said the leaders
``deliberately sabotaged the talks.''
   Later Wednesday, Botha issued a statement asking Tutu to
repudiate the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla
movement. Tutu says he does not endorse the ANC's use of violence
but shares its professed goal of a non-racial democracy.
   ``The question must be posed whether you are acting on behalf of
the kingdom of God or the kingdom promised by the ANC and the SACP
(South African Communist Party),'' Botha said.
   ``Are you in favor of the establishment of a Marxist
dictatorship in South Africa under the rule of the ANC and the
SACP, to the detriment of the church?''
   Tutu later met with Botha to urge clemency for the ``Sharpeville
Six'' _ a group of blacks scheduled to hang Friday for complicity
in a 1984 mob killing during anti-apartheid unrest.
   Tutu said Botha scolded him for taking a confrontational stance
toward the government.
   The archbishop said his decision to cancel the church meeting
was influenced by a ``background of unease'' related to the
scheduled hangings. He urged Dutch Reformed leaders to join
Anglican clergy in prayers for condemned prisoners.
   The Dutch Reformed leaders' statement referred to comments by
Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak, a mixed-race minister, at a church
service Sunday in Cape Town.
   Tutu and Boesak were protesting a recent government ban on
political activity by 19 organizations.
   Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches,
and Tutu used strong language in responding to Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok's warnings that he will act against the
clergymen if they did not stop ``preaching revolution.''
   Boesak said the government ``signed its own death warrant. ...
No government can challenge the living God and survive.''
   Tutu said, ``If it is revolution to say I work for a South
Africa that is truly democratic ... I am for that.''
   The Dutch Reformed Church objected to the clergymen's
``language, convictions and veiled threats that do not breathe the
spirit of the Gospel.''
   It said it was ``not unsympathetic to the problems that churches
in this country have to contend with.'' But the statement called on
Boesak and Tutu ``to divorce themselves from this impious road and
to discuss their problems openly'' with Vlok and Botha ``who are
both avowed Christians.''
   Botha issued a statement Wednesday through the South African
Broadcasting Corp. saying the churches had to recognize ``certain
limitations in the execution of their prophetic task outside the
ecclesiastical field.''
   One major point of Boesak's and Tutu's sermons was to dispute
Vlok's statement that they were preaching revolution instead of the
Christian message.
   The Dutch Reformed statement appeared to agree with Vlok and
Botha.
   ``In exceeding these limits they have confronted the state, and
cannot equate themselves with the church in the face of state
retaliation,'' it said. ``The Church of Jesus Christ cannot be used
as a means for a revolutionary change of government.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Woman Pleads Guilty To Locking Boy In Box</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman who pleaded guilty to keeping an
8-year-old in a playhouse-sized box for two years says she was
trying to prevent the boy from destroying her property while she
slept.
   Retha Skyles, 54, pleaded guilty to unlawful imprisonment
Tuesday. Sentencing was set for April 26.
   The child, who was kept in the box from 1985 to 1987, is the son
of Ms. Skyles' stepdaughter. When the boy was removed from the
Skyles home, he said he was surprised to learn that all little boys
weren't kept in boxes, court papers said.
   In a handwritten statement, Ms. Skyles said, ``I restrained (the
boy) during my sleeping hours in order to keep him from destroying
property.
   ``My judgment may not have been proper, but my judgment as to
the amount of restraint seemed proper to me under the
circumstances,'' she said.
   The box often was locked and contained a jar in which the boy
was expected to urinate, police said. He was not allowed to attend
school, but did attend church. When he was removed from the home,
he had a severe case of head lice.
   The law provides for a maximum sentence of 90 days in jail, two
years' probation and a requirement that the woman pay indefinitely
for counseling for the boy, deputy prosecutor Barbara Corey-Boulet
said Wednesday.
   However, a judge can declare the case exceptional and impose a
stronger sentence.
   The prosecutor declined to comment on whether she thought the
sentence contained in the law would be appropriate, adding only
that the boy is ``going to be needing a lot of counseling as he
adjusts to a more normal life and she's (Ms. Skyles) going to be
paying for that. That's the kind of punishment that will benefit
the child.''
   Larry Fehr, executive director of the non-profit Washington
Council on Crime and Delinquency, said: ``One can't help but be
struck by the discrepancy ... in regard to a child being confined
for a much longer period of time than the person who pleaded guilty
to the crime.''
   Ms. Skyles' attorney, Wallace Cavanagh, did not return messages
left with his office Wednesday.
   An anonymous tip led Child Protective Services workers to the
Skyles home, where they took the boy and his 11-year-old sister
into custody. They are living with foster parents and are
``thriving,'' said Frank Mendizabal, DSHS spokesman.

<HEAD>Ferry Workers Vote To Continue Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOVER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 2,000 ferry workers voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday to continue a six-week strike against a
ferry line, despite a company ultimatum to sign new contracts or
lose their jobs.
   In an outdoor meeting in this southeast England port, all but
two of the ferry workers from the National Union of Seamen raised
their hands in favor of maintaining the strike.
   Roger Wilkins, deputy general secretary, and other union leaders
urged members to step up picketing and fight what they said were
moves by P and O European Ferries to hire non-union foreign workers.
   The strike has halted sailings of P and O's 11 vessels between
Dover and the French ports of Boulogne and Calais across the
English Channel and Zeebrugge, Belgium, across the North Sea.
   Peter Ford, chairman of the ferry company, denied the company
planned to use foreign workers and said he was disappointed with
the vote.
   ``I hope they will opt for the new contracts,'' he said.
   The ferry workers struck after the company announced plans to
reduce the number of crews for each vessel.
   Pay for a deckhand ranges from $23,125 to $33,300 a year.
   The union agreed to fewer jobs to maintain profitable operations
against the challenge of the Channel Tunnel project, but wanted the
cuts spread over three years.
   The underwater rail tunnel now being built between England and
France is scheduled to open in May 1993 at a cost of $9 billion and
is expected to cut into ferry profits.
   The company's ultimatum followed the collapse of five days of
talks with the union, which were convened by the government's
arbitration service. Each side accused the other of intransigence.
   Six hundred ferry masters and officers will decide whether to
settle a dispute with the company at a meeting Saturday.
   The company wants to cut 200 of their jobs because of
redundancies and new work patterns. The officers have not been on
strike.

   A Republican senator said the investigation
that led to indictments Wednesday of four people in the Iran-Contra
scandal was a ``colossal embarrassment'' to the government, while
Democrats said the charges vindicate last year's congressional
inquiry into the arms and money affair.
   The charges were announced by Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent
counsel whose investigation began about the same time that
committees of both the House and Senate began looking at the secret
sale of U.S. weapons to Iran and the diversion of some of the money
to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate
committee, said he believes that ``justice will ultimately be
done.''
   Inouye added that ``I personally remain convinced that they (the
four men) exhibited insufficient sensitivity to the rule of law,
and to the fact that under our system of government the Congress
must make the laws,'' but he said, ``we must await the verdict of a
jury of their peers as to whether this insensitivity was criminal
in nature.''
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Iran-Contra
committee, noted that the indictments closely paralleled the
conclusions of the congressional committees, although the panels
made no attempt to assess criminal blame.
   ``I don't think there are any major surprises,'' he said,
although ``there was more of an emphasis on the misuse of federal
funds ... than I might have anticipated.''
   ``They are very serious charges, obviously, and quite
extensive,'' Hamilton told reporters. ``They cover a lot of
misconduct.'' He added that Walsh probably developed more
information than the committees were able to get on financial
records.
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, another member of the Senate
panel, said, ``it is a serious matter when any citizen is charged
with a crime, and it is even more serious when a former high
government official, and close adviser to the president, is
charged.''
   Mitchell said ``no one should prejudge the case,'' but said he
had heard nothing in the indictments which had not come out during
last summer's Iran-Contra hearings.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, another member of the Senate panel,
was one of the administration's strongest supporters during the
congressional hearings and he was critical of the indictments.
   The investigation was ``a colossal embarrassment to our whole
government,'' Hatch told a news conference. ``It's going to be a
very tricky trial to try to prove these charges in an open forum.''
   ``I'm not white-washing this. There were serious mistakes made
here,'' Hatch said.
   ``You may very well be able to get convictions under
technicalities of the law,'' he said, speaking of the indictments,
but ``these indictments are choking on the nits of the law.''
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a member of the House investigating
committee and another strong administration supporter, said,
``these indictments aren't any surprise. But this is only the
beginning of what will be a very long legal process that will
question the sufficiency of the indictments and the
constitutionality of the laws.''
   For example, he said, ``I believe the indictments are premised
on some assumptions that may or may not be true, like title to the
money. The prosecutors believe the money from the sale of weapons
to Iran belonged to the U.S. Treasury and therefore it was
misappropriated for the Contras, but I think a very good argument
can be made that the proceeds of the sale don't belong to the
Treasury.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., a candiate for the Democratic
presidential nomination, said, ``whatever the outcome of these
prosecutions, I think the special prosecutor has given us fresh
evidence that the Reagan administration generally has put the
Constitution of the United States through the shredder.''
   ``This will be an important issue in the campaign,'' Gephardt
said, particularly the role of Vice President George Bush, who is
the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.
   Jesse Jackson, another presidential candidate, said the
indictments were ``a source of embarrassment to this administration
and a disgrace to our country,'' but called those indicted ``the
fall guys.''
   ``They were, in fact, implementing this administration's
policy,'' he said.
   Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, the fired White House aide who was one
of the four men charged, was supported Wednesday by Andy Messing,
head of the National Defense Council, a private, conservative
organization. Messing is a friend of North.
   ``It's a difference between persecution and prosecution that
Walsh is going to have to explain to the American people,'' Messing
said. ``After 15 months and $10 million and almost 300 people at
his disposal, Judge Walsh is going to have to convince the American
people that is not persecution but a prosecution.''
   Robert Grant, president of another group that supports North,
the American Freedom Coalition, issued a statement calling on the
president to pardon North.
   ``Col. North is a man of principle, honor and commitment. His
patriotic, pro-American values are a tremendous asset to the
well-being of the United States,'' Grant said.
   ``This is hardly the definition of a criminal,'' Grant said.
``He should be pardoned immediately.''

   A soldier in one of the units involved
in a helicopter collision that killed 17 servicemen said at a
memorial service Wednesday that the loss was magnified by ``the
bond between us soldiers.''
   Military and civilian dignitaries, including Gov. Wallace G.
Wilkinson, joined family members and other mourners in the 450-seat
Post Central Chapel for two services.
   The first half-hour memorial honored the seven Army aviators
flying the helicopters when they collided March 8; the second paid
homage to the 10 foot soldiers on board.
   An open Bible rested on a simple altar, flanked by banners
representing the the 101st Airborne Division and flags pinned with
colorful streamers representing battles in which units of the 101st
fought.
   The seven helicopter crewmen were represented in front of the
altar by seven flight helmets placed atop sabers for the officers
and M-16 rifles for the enlisted men. Infantry helmets were used to
represent the foot soldiers.
   The 17 were killed when a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, returning
from a night mission, was struck by another copter on a separate
mission at Fort Campbell.
   Army investigators said they have not determined the cause of
the crash.
   ``During the toughest of times we find ourselves wondering why
we choose to be infantrymen,'' said Spec. 4 Colin Cannon, whose
unit included 10 of the victims. ``It is a job that is at best
difficult and at its worst fatal.''
   The loss was magnified by ``the bond between us as soldiers,
which brought us closer to each other in a way that so many others
can never know; something that only people who serve in a
profession such as ours can ever understand,'' Cannon said.
   ``I have flown personally with each of these (helicopter crew
members). I can tell you without reservation that they truly loved
what they were doing,'' said Lt. Col. Joseph A. Fucci, commander of
the 101st Aviation Regiment's 5th Brigade.
   ``We all share in the loss of these men. And though all the
grief that we feel does not begin to compare with the sorrow being
felt by their wives and their families, our hearts and our prayers
go out to you,'' he said.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
proposed Wednesday that the superpowers freeze their naval forces
in the Mediterranean as a first step toward reducing tensions in
the region.
   He described the Mediterranean as ``one of the most explosive
regions in the world'' and recommended that the freeze begin July 1.
   In a wide-ranging speech to the Yugoslav Parliament, Gorbachev
also indirectly criticized the late Soviet dictator Josef Stalin,
who imposed an economic blockade of Yugoslavia after President
Josip Broz Tito set his own foreign policy course in 1948.
   The Kremlin leader also discussed the ethnic unrest in his own
country, saying he was determined to resolve it democratically but
would not allow independence for nationalist groups.
   Yugoslavia itself is an ethnically diverse nation of six
republics and two autonomous regions and is plagued by growing
ethnic tensions as the economic situation worsens.
   Gorbachev later flew to Ljubljana, capital of the northern
Slovenia republic, one of the most prosperous regions in the
communist world.
   Plans for the Soviet Communist Party chief to visit a private
farm in the area were canceled because he arrived late, officials
said.
   Gorbachev will meet Slovenian leaders Thursday as he continues
his five-day visit here.
   Gorbachev said his country was concerned about the military
presence in the Mediterranean because it is provides Soviet ports
on the Black Sea their only access to the world's oceans.
   In addition to the naval freeze, Gorbachev called on the
superpowers to set a limit on the number of vessels they maintain
in the Mediterranean, and he suggested they give each other and
nations in the region advance notice when they redistribute their
forces or conduct military exercises there.
   Gorbachev also proposed that military observers be permitted to
watch such maneuvers.
   He made no direct reference to ethnic rioting in the Soviet
republic of Azerbaijan, in which at least 32 people were killed,
nor did he mention mass demonstrations in the Armenian capital of
Yerevan.
   But he said the state of relations between the more than 100
nationalities within the Soviet Union is ``one of the most
important and delicate issues in a multinational country such as
ours.''
   ``There are certain difficulties inherited from the past,''
Gorbachev said, apparently referring to a 1923 decision to put an
Aremenian-controlled region under control of Azerbaijan.
   Armenians' demands for annexation of that region are believed to
have been at the root of the Sumgait riots.
   ``We are determined to secure democratic solutions to these
problems,'' Gorbachev said, but he served notice that he would not
tolerate nationalists' demands for independence. That theme has
been kept alive by exile groups from the Baltic republics of
Lithusania, Latvia and Estonia.
   ``Whatever constituent or autonomous republic or region we take,
it is now bound by thousands of threads to all other parts of the
country,'' Gorbachev said. ``It has indisoluble links within the
integrated economic and political complex.''
   Gorbachev said the 1948 rupture in relations between his country
and Yugoslavia ``inflicted grave damage on Yugoslav-Soviet
relations and ... on socialism as a whole.''
   But he assured his hosts he wants improved relations with
Yugoslavia and does not intend to try to press his ideas of
perestroika, or restructuring, on them.
   ``We are implementing our perestroika in keeping with the
conditions and needs of our own country, and we have no intention
whatsoever to palm it off as a universal model or recipe that would
be good for all,'' Gorbachev said.
   The Soviet leader blasted unnamed leaders in the NATO alliance
for ``harping on the lie'' of a Soviet threat to prevent nuclear
disarmament and build up NATO's conventional forces in Europe.
   ``These contradictions, not to say absurdities, have quite
definite political convictions behind them,'' Gorbachev said.

   Thousands of yellow ribbons adorned trees,
traffic signs and lapels on Terry Anderson Day in the journalist's
hometown Wednesday, the third anniversary of his kidnapping by
Moslem extremists in Lebanon.
   ``The most sacred experience is to be remembered by frends,
loved ones and by God,'' said the Rev. Jack Wolter of St. James
Episcopal Church, where prayer services were held for Anderson.
   ``We pray that Terry will be remembered today and soon delivered
from his tormenters,'' Wolter said.
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped in Beirut and has been held longer than any of
the 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   The activities in Batavia coincided with a national observance
in Washington, D.C. The anniversary also was marked in Anderson's
birthplace, Lorain, Ohio, where a group including relatives hoisted
an American flag and tied a yellow ribbon to the flagpole at City
Hall.
   ``May this be a day of miracles,'' the Rev. Thomas Vickers, who
has acted as personal chaplain to Anderson's family in recent
months, said in Batavia. ``Please Lord, set him free.''
   Journalists outnumbered the handful of churchgoers at an early
morning service at St. James. Vickers asked reporters to put down
their notebooks to join hands and pray for a colleague.
   At the church's midday service about 30 people heard a service
by Vickers and Wolter, who said Christians had a duty to speak up
for those who suffer injustice.
   Anderson's younger brother, Jack, who grew up in Batavia and
works as a prison guard in Ocala, Fla., urged those attending to
write their congressmen to press the government to do more to win
the release of the hostages.
   ``I'm sure Terry is thinking of Batavia today,'' he said. ``I
know he wants more than anything to be able come back here and be
with his family and friends.''
   Several florists in the small city of 17,000 donated more than
two miles of yellow ribbon, which was tied in bows and handed out
to residents. Nearly every tree, sign post and railing along Main
Street sported yellow ribbon.
   ``We always knew people were concerned about Terry,'' Jack
Anderson said. ``But in the past they didn't turn out and make an
effort to show it.''
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say of Batavia, has fought to free her
brother since his kidnapping, but her activities did not win
widespread support in her hometown until recently.
   ``People didn't know how to react,'' said Terry Fritts, a talk
show host on radio station WBTA. ``I don't think many people
opposed what Peggy was doing. They just didn't know if it was the
best thing to do.''
   Mrs. Say, who was in Washington on Wednesday, and other family
members have said they hope the attention will force the
administration to develop a new policy.

   Jesse Jackson said Wednesday he's counting
``the number of votes, not the color of votes'' in the wake of his
second-place showing in his home state of Illinois where he
garnered less than 10 percent of the white vote.
   Jackson also said the four men indicted Wednesday on conspiracy
charges in the Iran-Contra affair _ Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, fired
national security adviser John M. Poindexter, retired Air Force
Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and Secord's business partner, Albert
Hakim _ were ``fall guys.''
   ``They were in fact implementing this administration's policy,''
Jackson said, calling the Iran-Contra affair `` a source of
embarrassment to this administration and a disgrace to our
country.''
   Back on the subject of the Illinois contest, Jackson was upbeat.
   ``We came in a strong second in Illinois,'' he told reporters.
``I am gratified with the response to my campaign in Illinois
yesterday.''
   ``We did well. Illinois did well by both of its favorite-son
candiates,'' he said, when asked about pre-election polls that had
showed him virtually dead even with home state Sen. Paul Simon.
Jackson ended up with 31 percent of the vote, to Simon's 43 percent.
   Exit polls showed Jackson overwhelming won the state's black
vote, but pulled only 7 to 8 percent of white voters into his camp.
That was less than the 10 percent he garnered across the Super
Tuesday states on March 8, and a represented an apparent setback
from his strong showings in Northern states that have black
populations of 1 percent or less, including Minnesota, Maine,
Vermont and Alaska.
   When asked if that spelled trouble in the states yet to come as
he tries to attract crucial white support to his campaign, Jackson
replied, ``Let's count the number of votes, not the color of
votes.'' He noted he is first in the cumulative popular vote count
of states that have held primaries so far, and is a close second in
the delegate count to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``Of 30 contests now I have come in number one or number two ...
We have reason to celebrate in my campaign. We are where every
campaign wants to be.''
   Jackson made the comments following an observance at Holy
Trinity Church of the third year of captivity for American hostage
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press who is being held in Lebanon.
   Earlier he had a chance meeting at National Airport with rival
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., of Tennessee, who was leaving as Jackson was
arriving. The two spoke briefly, and according to Jackson talked
about party unity.
   Organizers of the hostage memorial said all the presidential
candidates were invited to the service, which included remarks by
former hostages and family members of Anderson and others still
being held. Jackson, who helped gain release of downed Navy pilot
Lt. Robert Goodman from Syria in 1983, was the only one who
attended.
   At a news conference afterward, Jackson said he has ``done
everything I can'' to make contacts that might secure the hostage
release, but that the situation is complicated because he does not
know who is holding the hostages.
   He criticized the administration, however, saying that the U.S.
intelligence operations should be put to work finding the location
of the hostages and the identity of the captors so that
negotiations for their release can begin.
   ``They can be found, through our intelligence network,'' he
said, adding that negotiations should begin ``either directly or
through our allies.''
   Outside the church in the posh Georgetown neighborhood of
Washington, Jackson caused a stir among Holy Trinity elementary
school students, Georgetown University students and passersby who
rushed out to shake his hand.
   The school children squealed in delight as he raced across a
cobblestone street to greet them, then went to the other side to
shake hands with college students who rushed out on the balconies
of their brownstone homes to cheer him.
   ``I don't think I'd want him to win, but I think I might vote
for him. He's the only one bringing out the important issues,''
said Erich Vaden, 19, a Georgetown student.
   Later, Jackson went to one of Washington's most well-known
drug-trafficking neighborhoods, where he and District of Columbia
Mayor Marion Barry addressed a rally. Jackson made a strong
anti-drug statement, telling 300 people, ``We must stop drugs or
drugs will stop the people.''
   ``You must be sober and free of drugs whether you have a job or
not,'' he said. Jackson also said drugs are a foreign policy issue
that has been dealt with inadequately by the Reagan administration.

<NOTE>EDS: Subs 13th graf bgng: ``Prohibit discrimination ... to CORRECT

   President Reagan vetoed a major civil rights
bill Wednesday, saying it would ``vastly and unjustifiably extend
the power of the federal government over the decisions and affairs
of private organizations.''
   Reagan also proposed an alternative that he said would ``protect
civil rights and at the same time preserve the independence of
state and local governments, the freedom of religion and the right
of America's citizens to order their lives and businesses without
extensive federal intrusion.''
   The veto was immediately criticized by civil rights and other
groups, and congressional Democrats predicted a quick override.
   The legislation, which had bipartisan support, passed the Senate
75-14 on Jan. 28 and the House 315-98 on March 2. Both votes are
more than the two-thirds majority necessary to override a
presidential veto.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, called the veto ``a kick in the teeth of
civil rights. It is the most regrettable and least justifiable of
all the Reagan vetoes.''
   The bill the president vetoed was designed to undo the effects
of a 1984 Supreme Court ruling that, in cutting off federal funds
because of illegal discrimination, the government could treat each
specific ``program or activity'' separately.
   That meant that other parts of the institution involved could
still receive federal funds.
   Under the bill, federal aid to the entire institution would have
to be cut off in such cases.
   In his veto message, the president said he supported legislation
to ``strengthen the civil rights coverage of educational
institutions'' that were affected by the high court's decision.
   He said he had already endorsed legislation to do this but his
new bill ``goes further than the legislation previously endorsed.''
   Reagan's bill is similar to one rejected by the House by a vote
of 266-146.
   The president said his bill would:
   _``Prohibit discrimination against women, minorities, persons
with disabilities, and the elderly across the board in public
school districts, public systems of higher education, systems of
vocational education, and private educational institutions which
receive any public aid.
   _``Extend the application of the civil rights statutes to entire
businesses which receive federal aid as a whole and to the entire
plant or facility receiving federal aid in every other instance.
   _``Prohibit discrimination in all of the federally funded
programs of departments and agencies of state and local
governments.''
   Reagan said his bill ``complements well our body of existing
federal civil rights laws.''
   ``Congress, on the other hand, has sent me a bill that would
vastly and unjustifiably expand the power of the federal government
over the decisions and affairs of private organizations, such as
churches and synagogues, farms, businesses, and state and local
governments,'' he said. ``In the process, it would place at risk
such cherished values as religious liberty.''
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education
and Labor Committee, said he was confident the House will override
the veto. ``I don't think many members will be so weak-kneed that
they will change on the basis of lobbying that is now going on,''
Hawkins said.
   House Speaker Jim Wright said in a statement that ``President
Reagan may want to turn the clock back on civil rights, but the
American people do not... I am confident that the Senate and House
will move swiftly to override this unfortunate and shortsighted
veto.''
   A Senate leadership aide said the chamber would vote Thursday on
overriding the veto. The House was not expected to act before
Tuesday.
   Ralph G. Neas, director of the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights, and Benjamin L. Hooks, chairman of the organization, issued
a statement denouncing the president's action and predicting that
it would be overturned.
   ``While we are confident that huge bipartisan majorities in both
houses of Congress will vote to override a presidential veto, we
believe strongly that this veto is not in the best interests of the
country because it sends a terrible signal to the nation,
especially in this bicentennial year of the Constitution,'' the
statement said.
   ``The president sometimes expresses wonder that anyone can
criticize him on his civil rights record,'' the two leaders said.
``In fact this administration is compiling the worst civil rights
record of any administration in half a century.''
   The AFL-CIO issued a statement Wednesday calling the veto ``a
strong message of retreat from enforcement of laws intended to
prevent discrimination based on race, sex, age and handicap.''
   The United States Catholic Conference, an association
representing the nation's Roman Catholic bishops, issued a
statement saying the conference was
   ``deeply disappointed that the president saw fit to veto one of
the most important pieces of civil rights legislation to come along
in many years.''
   It said the bill would have done much to ``strengthen federal
civil rights protection while safeguarding vital concerns about
human life and religious liberty.'' The conference vowed to work
``actively'' for an override.
   The White House, in a statement accompanying Reagan's veto
message, said the administration alternative would protect
religious liberty by limiting coverage to the part of a church or
synagogue that participates in a federal program. The statement
said the Reagan bill would provide that when a religious secondary
or elementary school receives federal assistance, only that school,
and not the entire religious school system, would become subject to
federal regulation.
   The statement said the measure would ``ensure that the reach of
the federal regulation into private businesses extends only to the
facility that participates in federally funded programs, unless the
business as a whole receives federal aid, in which case it is
covered in its entirety.''
   It said the administration bill also states explicitly that
farmers will not become subject to federal regulation by accepting
federal price support payments and that grocers and supermarkets
would not be afgfected because they accept food stamps from
customers.
   It said the independence of state and local governments would be
preserved because federal regulation would be limited to the part
of a state or local entity that receives or distributes federal
assistance.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday he believed
the bill would attract the support of ``a large number'' of
senators and representatives.

<HEAD>Official: More Soviets Receiving Visas to Visit, Live Abroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More Soviets are applying to visit or live abroad
and fewer of them are being refused permission, a Soviet official
said Wednesday.
   Sergei Apatov, head of the Moscow police department's visa
office, told Soviet journalists that 82 percent of Soviets who
apply to go to Israel are granted permission.
   About 200 people have been turned down, he said. He did not
break the number down into travel and emigration requests or
provide an overall figure.
   The government newspaper Izvestia and the official Tass news
agency carried reports on Apatov's briefing.
   Apatov said citizens were refused permission either because of
their access to state secrets or because they could not satisfy
their relatives' financial demands.
   He said those not allowed to leave because of their alleged
access to state secrets can reapply, usually after six months.
   Many Soviet Jews say officials abuse the law that says people
can not leave if they know state secrets or are needed by their
families for financial reasons.
   Western sources say more than 8,000 Soviet Jews were allowed to
emigrate in 1987, after several years when emigration was held to
about 1,000 a year. Emigration reached its peak in 1979, when more
than 51,000 people left.
   Apatov said a reduction in the paperwork needed to travel abroad
also prompted more Soviets to apply for permission for trips.
   The number of people applying to travel to capitalist countries
increased 93 percent in the first two months of 1988, Apatov said.
The number of people refused such permission fell 44 percent in
1987 from the previous year, he said, without providing specific
figures.
   A fee imposed on those leaving for capitalist and developing
countries has been halved to 200 rubles (about $320), Apatov said.

   Gov. Evan Mecham took the stand at his
impeachment trial Wednesday and said that he did not protect an
aide accused of making a death threat and did not sell appointments
for campaign contributions.
   The governor, portraying himself as a naive victim of political
enemies who skewered him with bad publicity, said the public never
saw him as ``the nice guy I really am.''
   ``I've learned a lot,'' he said in his first appearance at the
Senate trial, which opened Feb. 29. The first-term Republican was
scheduled to return to the stand on Thursday.
   Mecham, 63, is the first U.S. governor to face an impeachment
trial in six decades. Wednesday's session was his first return to
the seat of state government in more than a month.
   He is accused of trying to obstruct an investigation of an
alleged death threat against a former aide who was about to testify
in an investigation of Mecham's finances. He is also charged with
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan and misusing $80,000 in state
money by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   Mecham has denied wrongdoing.
   The 192-seat Senate gallery was jammed as Mecham took the stand.
Senators remained standing as he took an oath to tell the truth.
   Defense attorney Fred Craft asked whether Mecham intended to
protect the aide accused of making the death threat, Lee Watkins.
   ``Protect him from what?'' Mecham asked. ``I've heard those
allegations. I wish somebody would tell me what I protected him
from.''
   Craft mentioned a conversation in which Mecham was alleged to
have ordered the state's top law enforcement officer to resist the
attorney general's investigation of the alleged threat.
   ``Were you intending to do anything to protect Lee Watkins (in
that conversation)?'' asked Craft.
   ``Not in the least,'' said Mecham.
   Mecham has claimed he was inadequately informed about the death
threat allegation.
   He has acknowledged he may have told the state's top police
official, Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead, to
resist the attorney general's efforts to investigate. Milstead has
said he cooperated with the attorney general.
   Mecham on Wednesdsay also denied allegations that he rewarded
fund-raisers with jobs. ``Money was never an object and it was
never used as a criteria to get a job,'' he said.
   The governor also denied that Watkins was his biggest
fund-raiser, saying Watkins ``brought in some loans'' but not a
huge amount in contributions.
   Last week, Donna Carlson, a former Mecham aide, had testified
that Watkins was protected by the Mecham administration because of
his fund-raising.
   She said that when she once complained about Watkins' position
in the governor's inner circle she was told by the governor's
then-chief of staff: ``We have to take care of Lee. He raised a lot
of money for the campaign.''
   Earlier Wednesday, Sam Udall, Mecham's former appointments
secretary, had testified that campaign contributions were a
criterion, although not a major one, in making appointments to
state boards and commissions.
   Udall also testified that he did not immediately realize that
two proposed appointees to the Housing Finance Review Board had
been recommended by Barry Wolfson, who provided a $350,000 campaign
loan to Mecham.
   Mecham, a millionaire auto dealer, said Wednesday that he
himself was his biggest campaign contributor.
   ``Unfortunately I always have been,'' he said of his political
career, which included four previous runs for governor before his
successful 1986 campaign.
   Mecham also seized the opportunity to complain of being
misunderstood on one of his first official acts, elimination of the
state's Martin Luther King holiday. He said that his action was
mandated by the attorney general and that he replaced a paid state
holiday with an unpaid ``recognition day.''
   ``What we did was tell peoiple we in Arizona believe in civil
rights for all people,'' he said.
   Shortly before Mecham appeared, the Senate resoundingly voted
down a motion to dismiss the charges. The senators also defeated
defense motions to declare a mistrial or to hold a hearing on
defense claims of witness tampering.
   Robert Usdane, House Republican majority leader, noted that
claims by Mecham's lawyers that the state police were intimidating
witnesses were under investigation by law enforcement agencies.
   Mecham, a perennial political outsider who won election in a
three-way race, has been staying at suburban Glendale offices he
calls his ``government in exile.'' He retains his salary and is
referred to as governor during the impeachment proceedings, but
Mofford has gubernatorial power pending the outcome of the trial.
   It would take a two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate to
convict Mecham and remove him from office. The senators could then
take another vote and bar him for life from holding state office.
   Mecham also faces a criminal trial April 21 on charges he
concealed the $350,000 loan, and a recall election is scheduled for
May 17.

   Reputed druglord Carlos Lehder Rivas
interrupted his smuggling trial Wednesday to say he had evidence
the chief prosecutor was blackmailing the judge, an allegation the
prosecutor called ``high comedy.''
   U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle said the man who sent the letter to
Lehder had ``mental problems'' and had made similar allegations
about authorities in Tampa, where he had been convicted on
extortion and racketeering charges.
   U.S. District Judge Howell Melton read the letter and said he
had also received previous letters from the man.
   Lehder, 38, charged with smuggling tons of cocaine into the
United States, rose as the court was breaking for a mid-morning
recess.
   ``Your honor, I would like to disclose that I have received
evidence that Mr. Merkle is blackmailing Judge Melton and I'd like
to present it,'' he said.
   ``This is high comedy,'' Merkle said as Melton said he'd like to
hear any such evidence.
   The statement apparently was unexpected even by Lehder's
attorneys. It resulted in quick recesses so they could confer with
their client. The letter-writer's name was not revealed in court.
   ``This individual is familiar to me. He has mental problems,''
said the prosecutor.
   ``I do not intend for the integrity of this court, nor the
prosecutor to be impugned,'' the judge said of the allegations. ``I
would categorically say that at this time, they are absolutely
untrue.''
   The judge gave the defense until Thursday morning to file any
motions they might want to make concerning the material.
   Lehder said the information had been filed by the letter writer
with a federal appeals court and the Senate Judiciary Committee.
``I wanted to just call it to the judge's attention so that
something can be done about it,'' said Lehder.
   Defense attorney Edward R. Shohat said his client had no
personal knowledge about the source of the information.
   Lehder, reputed to be one of the leaders of Colombia's Medellin
cocaine cartel, is on trial on charges he and others conspired to
import some 3.3 tons of the drug into the United States from
Colombia via the Bahamas.
   Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is
charged with being a part of the smuggling conspiracy.

   A state agency cited Morton Thiokol Inc.
for six safety violations and fined the aerospace company $31,700
Wednesday in a fire in an MX missile motor assembly building Dec.
29 that killed five workers.
   The victims' presence in the building and failure to use
remote-control equipment instead at the time of the fire were among
the most serious violations alleged by the Utah Division of
Occupational Safety and Health.
   The penalties represent the maximum that could be imposed, said
Doug McVey, UOSH administrator.
   The contractor has 30 days to appeal the citations and penalties
to the independent Utah UOSH Review Commission. Three violations
were deemed willful and serious, two were deemed serious and one
was ``other than serious.''
   In a statement late Wednesday, Chicago-based Morton Thiokol said
that it is ``confident that the facts will not substantiate any
conscious or knowing violation of the act'' and that it will
challenge the citations.
   Morton Thiokol described many of the alleged violations as
``random instances unknown to company management, which reflect a
failure of some employees to follow all rules established by the
company.''
   The company said increased supervision and stricter enforcement
of the company's discipline program have been instituted as a
remedy.
   The workers were withdrawing the core from a casting of the
first stage of an MX missile when 100,000 pounds of solid fuel
ignited in a fireball. The blaze caused $6.2 million in damage to
the plant 25 miles west of Brigham City.
   Morton Thiokol makes the missile's four stages, and also makes
the space shuttle's solid-fuel rocket boosters, which failed when
the Challenger blew up in January 1986.
   The fire at Thiokol's Wasatch Division has held up production of
the MX missile until the cause of the fire can be determined and
corrected.
   Air Force investigators, in a briefing Wednesday, blamed either
static electricity or friction, perhaps from grit, as the probable
cause of the fire, said Art Kingdom, a spokesman for Rep. Wayne
Owens, D-Utah.
   Another theory is that as the propellant was compressed, its
chemistry changed, making it more volatile, Kingdom said.
   McVey said state investigators agreed with the Air Force's
findings, although his division's investigation focused on safety
regulations, not the cause.
   Results of the Air Force's investigation were scheduled to be
made public Thursday, but members of Utah's congressional
delegation were briefed a day in advance.
   UOSH alleged that workmen were removing the core from an engine
manually rather than by remote control. The cores, or metal forms,
are removed after the propellant has been poured into the casing
and allowed to harden.
   The agency also said protective walls and barricades were not
provided, and proper precautions against static electricty weren't
taken.
   In addition, it said, dual controls for a hydraulic system were
not interlocked to prevent unintentional operations, and employees
entering the explosive material area did not turn over all
prohibited articles, such as coins and keys.
   Also, an unauthorized crowbar was in a restricted area, UOSH
said.
   Kingdom said the Air Force recommended better electrical
grounding, increased humidity and more care in withdrawing cores
from engines.
   The Air Force said the fire destroyed one of three missile
engine cores. Investigators said two completed castings are
awaiting withdrawal of the cores before the engines can be shipped
to the Air Force in California, Kingdom said.
   Kingdom said the Air Force had indicated it needed the engines
within the two months to continue its MX test program.

<HEAD>Former Mayor Jane Byrne May Quit Politics after Third Straight
Loss</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 4-5 pvs bgng, `Mrs. Byrne ...' to UPDATE with
comment from Byrne.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Mayor Jane Byrne kicked in the door of
Chicago's fabled backroom politics nearly a decade ago, unsmiling
and unafraid of mixing it up with the Democratic machine's big boys.
   But after her third straight electoral setback, this one for
clerk of the Cook County Circuit Court and viewed by many political
observers as the first step in a comeback bid, Mrs. Byrne
apparently is calling it quits.
   ``When we say the people spoke,'' Mrs. Byrne said of Tuesday's
primary defeat, ``they apparently shouted.
   ``And therefore,'' she added, ``I'm very good at taking hints.''
   ``I truly believe that politically it's all over for me,'' Mrs.
Byrne said Wednesday before leaving for Phoenix, Ariz.
   She headed west for ``some rest and relaxation,'' said Joe
Pecor, her campaign manager. Asked whether she would run again, he
said, ``Where she is concerned, one should never say never.''
   ``She has demonstrated time and again that she has a very solid
core of support running somewhere between 35 (percent) and 40
percent of the Democrats in Chicago and the county.''
   But that wasn't enough to stave off the late Harold Washington's
upset bid in the three-way 1983 Democratic mayoral primary, and it
wasn't enough when she tried to avenge that loss against Washington
last year.
   It turned out be too little again Tuesday when she lost to
Aurelia Pucinski, endorsed by the party organization that Mrs.
Byrne once held, vise-like, in her grip.
   And this latest loss came in a race rich with resonance and
names _ Pucinski, Byrne and Edward ``Fast Eddie'' Vrdolyak _ that
speak to the past, present and perhaps even the future of Cook
County's quirky Democratic politics.
   Mrs. Byrne, a former debutante with a flair for the dramatic,
became the city's first woman mayor in 1979, scoring a
rags-to-riches victory after campaigning against the political
machine of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley.
   She defeated the machine's candidate, then-Mayor Michael
Bilandic, with the help of much of the city's machine-weary blacks,
but later made peace with the regular Democrats.
   Included in that group were several aldermen Mrs. Byrne had
railed against as members of ``an evil cabal,'' most notably
Vrdolyak and Roman Pucinski, Aurelia Pucinski's father and one of
the machine's most loyal servants.
   But she paid dearly for cozying up to the old guard, as well as
for several other moves _ replacing blacks with whites on the
school board, then handing out hams at public-housing projects as
the 1983 election neared.
   Washington, galvanizing the black vote, turned her out of office
and became the city's first black mayor.
   He spent the next four years retooling the party machinery to
fit his needs, then became the first two-term mayor since Daley by
handily beating back successive challenges from Mrs. Byrne last
February in the primary and then Vrdolyak, running as a third-party
candidate, in April.
   After Washington's death in November, Alderman Eugene Sawyer
became mayor.
   Vrdolyak, saying the party under Washington had become
untenable, completed his move away from the Democratic organization
last year. Running as a Republican, he was unopposed in Tuesday's
primary for court clerk.
   In the meantime, Ms. Pucinski, an attorney and Metropolitan
Sanitary District commissioner, stepped out of her father's shadow
and was welcomed into the Washington camp.
   So much so that she may have beaten Byrne in Tuesday's race on
the strength of her showing among Chicago's blacks, who helped
propel her to a 52 percent to 38 percent victory over Mrs. Byrne
with nearly all the votes counted. Two other candidates, Thomas
Fuller, and Janice Hart, a follower of political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche, split the rest of the vote.
   Ms. Hart defeated Ms. Pucinski in the 1986 Democratic primary
for the Illinois secretary of state's office, won that November by
Republican Jim Edgar.
   Byrne's defeat spoiled an anticipated Byrne-Vrdolyak struggle in
the fall, a match of two former titans for an obscure office both
hoped would lead to bigger things.

<HEAD>Kim Dae-jung Resigns As Opposition Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By M.H. AHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kim Dae-jung resigned Thursday as
leader of his party in an attempt to unite the opposition before
National Assembly elections expected in April.
   He said he was stepping down because his presence as head of the
Party for Peace and Democracy was blocking unification and because
he failed to win the Dec. 16 presidential elections.
   ``I have keenly felt guilty,'' Kim Dae-jung said in a statement
read by a party vice president, Park Young-sook, who said she would
be acting party president.
   The statement made no mention of Kim Dae-jung's future plans. He
did not make the statement himself because he was ill, party
officials said.
   Efforts to unite Peace and Democracy with the rival
Reunification Democratic Party collapsed last week when Kim
Dae-jung refused the other party's demand that he resign.
   It was not clear if his resignation Thursday would clear the way
for the opposition to unite. The Reunification Democratic
leadership met after Kim Dae-jung's announcement to consider its
response.
   Kim Dae-jung acted after the Reunification Democrats moved to
unite with three smaller opposition parties.
   Many opposition supporters are angry that the two main
opposition parties have failed to join together, and party leaders
fear a major loss of support.
   Kim Dae-jung and his supporters split from the Reunification
Democratic Party to form the Peace and Democracy Party late last
year after he and Kim Young-sam, the Reunification Democrats'
leader, failed to agree on who should run for president.
   Both Kims ran and were defeated by the government party's
nominee, Roh Tae-woo, who became president Feb. 25. Opposition
supporters blamed the two Kims for the defeat because they split
the opposition vote.
   Kim Young-sam resigned as Reunification Democratic Party
president in February to clear the way for the two parties to
unite. Unity talks ran into problems over leadership and political
goals and collapsed.
   The opposition is concerned it will suffer a major defeat in the
National Assembly elections expected April 26.

   The Security Council unanimously urged
South Africa on Wednesday to commute the sentences of the
``Sharpeville Six,'' sentenced to be executed for a 1984 death by
mob violence.
   Its resolution asked for a stay of the executions, scheduled for
Friday, and said South Africa's ``practice'' of executing opponents
of apartheid has harmed the search for peace.
   On Tuesday, President Reagan issued a personal appeal for the
lives of the six.
   They were convicted in the 1984 mob killing of a black township
councilman stoned and burned to death in the Sharpeville township
south of Johannesburg. An appeals court judge ruled that they did
not kill him personally but had common purpose with the mob.
   Dragoslav Pejic of Yugoslavia, Security Council president for
March, said death sentences for the ``African patriots'' had caused
``undivided international condemnation and uproar.'' He also said
thousands of innocent black South Africans have been detained and
tortured.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar sent a telegram to
President P.W. Botha of South Africa asking mercy be shown the five
men and one woman on humanitarian grounds.
   He said clemency would help reduce tensions in South Africa,
where 5 million whites control the government and the 26 million
blacks have no voice in national affairs.
   The council resolution spoke of the ``Pretoria racist regime's
decision to execute the Sharpeville Six ... in defiance of
worldwide appeals.''
   Ambassador A. Leslie Manley of South Africa issued a statement
criticizing the council, which frequently condemns his country.
   He said the government ``strongly objects'' to council action
that interferes ``not only in an internal South African matter but
also a matter which is the result of the due process of law.''
   South Africa ``is not insensitive to the feelings aroused by
capital punishment but must respect the independence of the
country's judicial system,'' his statement said. ``Murder is a
common law crime. It has nothing to do with the color of a person's
skin.''
   It said South African courts ``are highly respected'' and that
there are few countries ``if any, where the courts enjoy a higher
degree of independence from the executive authority.''
   This was the council's second action in a week of a resolution
condemning apartheid, the official South African policy of race
discrimination. Last Tuesday, the United States and Britain vetoed
a resolution that would have imposed economic sanctions.
   Wednesday's resolution said the executions would ``further
inflame an already grave situation in South Africa.''
   It urged South Africa to commute the sentences and asked all
countries and organizations to ``use influence and take urgent
measures to save the lives of the `Sharpeville Six'.''
   The United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and China are
permanent members of the council, with veto power. Other nations
currently serving are Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Japan,
Nepal, Senegal, West Germany, Yugoslavia and Zambia.

<HEAD>Authorities Probe Arms-To-Philippines Plot Pointing To Marcos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities in at least two states
are investigating whether Ferdinand Marcos tried to arrange an arms
shipment to Philippine forces loyal to him, according to federal
officials and other sources.
   Marcos' chief American attorney denied the former Philippine
president was involved in any arms shipments. ``That's a dry well
for you, my friend,'' Richard A. Hibey said Friday in Washington.
``There's no truth to that allegation.''
   Word that authorities were pressing such an investigation
surfaced here last week when U.S. District Judge Alfred J. Lechner
Jr., in sentencing a defendant in an arms smuggling case here,
referred to a continuing probe.
   Chris Franzblau, an attorney for the defendant, Abelardo Morua,
said Tuesday that federal agents had asked his client about Marcos.
   ``They asked a lot of times about if whether we had anything to
tie up Marcos to this transaction,'' he said, adding that Morua was
unable to provide such a link.
   Morua was charged with three others in a Customs Service sting
operation stemming from the alleged arms deal.
   No arms were alleged to have changed hands. However, officials
said the shipment would have supplied automatic rifles and
submachine guns for an 80-member force.
   Leon Dicker, a disbarred Hewlett, N.Y., attorney, was convicted
of conspiring to export weapons. The two others were acquitted.
Dicker was sentenced to four years in prison. Morua received a
two-year term.
   During the trial, the government said the arms were destined for
Thailand, but two federal officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said last week that the weapons were believed headed for
pro-Marcos forces in the Philippines.
   Pro-Marcos elements failed in at least two coup attempts in 1987.
   During Dicker's trial, the prosecutor said New York businessman
Robert L. Steele had worked with Dicker on the proposed arms
shipment.
   Steele, who was not charged, and Dicker have been linked to
Orlando C. Dulay, a Marcos supporter and former provincial governor
later connected by Philippine military sources to an August 1987
coup attempt against the government of Marcos' successor, Corazon
Aquino.
   Dulay was questioned by police on the grounds of a Marcos-owned
estate in Lawrence Township in August 1986. He said Steele and
Dicker, whom he identified as his lawyers, told him to clean up the
estate. He was not arrested.
   A newspaper in Manila said last week that Dulay was contacted by
U.S. authorities who traveled there seeking his cooperation in an
investigation of alleged arms shipments to pro-Marcos groups.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Peyton in Honolulu on Monday
confirmed that he met with Dulay last week, but said he could not
comment further because of an ``ongoing criminal investigation.''
   Raul Rabe, deputy chief of mission at the Philippines Embassy in
Washington, said Dulay joined Marcos in Honolulu before being
deported to the Philippines, where he faced charges in the 1986
slayings of three presidential campaign workers for Mrs. Aquino.
   Marcos has been living in exile in Honolulu since his 1986
ouster. He has said he wishes to return to his homeland.
   Last year, two U.S. businessmen testified before a House
subcommittee that Marcos had sought to buy weapons for shipment to
the Philippines in June, four months after Dicker's arrest. They
played for the panel secretly taped conversations with Marcos.
   It could not be determined if the alleged coup attempt, the
Dicker case and the Honolulu investigation were directly related.
   Neither U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. nor Richard Mercier,
head of Customs' Newark office, would comment on the case. Leonard
S. Walton, Customs director of illegal export investigations in
Washington, also would not comment.
   On Monday, Marcos issued a statement denying he wanted to resume
power ``through violent means.''
   Steele did not return repeated phone messages left this week and
last at his Commonwealth Group Ltd., a company in New York City.

   Soldiers tried to overthrow Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega on Wednesday but they were overpowered, and
thousands of people poured into the streets in the largest protest
yet of his continued rule.
   Many workers are broke in a country that uses U.S. dollars as
its currency but has almost none of them. Street corners in poor
neighborhoods were dotted with burning barricades Wednesday.
   The nation's Defense Forces said the coup attempt apparently was
led by Col. Leonidas Macias, head of the national police. He was
arrested along with three majors, a captain and some civilians, the
communique said.
   Maj. Edgardo Lopez, head of the military press office, said ``no
more than eight or nine'' officers were involved in the revolt. He
said there were no casualties but did not say what happened to
officers not listed among those arrested.
   It was the first sign of trouble within Noriega's Defense
Forces, which had kept a solid front through nine months of civil
unrest caused by accusations that Noriega was involved in crimes
ranging from drug trafficking to political assassination. He was
indicted on drug charges in Florida.
   The Panama Canal Commision, which supervises operation of the
50-mile waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, said
dockworkers' strikes and an electricity shutoff had not impeded
ship passage. The canal has its own electrical generating capacity.
   But operations stopped on the Trans-Panama pipeline, which
carries about 650,000 barrels of Alaskan crude oil a day across the
isthmus for delivery to Gulf of Mexico and East Coast markets. The
pipeline relies on local power and the U.S. Embassy in Panama City
said the line lacked electricity to drive the pumps.
   BP America Inc. and its subsidiary Sohio Oil own up to
three-quarters of the oil that flows through the line and Exxon Co.
USA owns the rest, comprising about 10 percent of total U.S.
production.
   Washington has put pressure on Noriega, and President Reagan
said Tuesday the United States wants him ``out of there.''
Sanctions such as freezing Panamanian accounts in U.S. banks and
withholding Panama Canal fees created a cash shortage that makes it
impossible to pay the 130,000 public employees.
   Flaming barricades blocked hundreds of streets on the third day
of the latest public protest. By midafternoon, police and military
units began reappearing in the city.
   Many protesters identified themselves as ``civilistas'' _
members of the National Civic Crusade, a coalition of about 200
business, professional, labor, student and opposition groups.
   The Crusade was formed last June to lead the campaign to oust
Noriega as chief of the Defense Forces, which include the military
and police.
   By midafternoon, the demonstrators were dispersed, buses and
taxis stopped running and the city was virtually deserted, with
most shops closed. Widespread looting broke out downtown, mostly by
youths.
   Reporters said men in civilian clothes fired pistols and rifles
at demonstrators from four-wheel-drive vehicles. Opponents have
accused the government of using hired thugs or plainclothes
security agents to break up protests.
   Electricity went out in most of the country after workers at the
state power company joined the protests at midday. Local telephone
service was sporadic.
   Protesters chanted ``Noriega must go!'' and ``Noreiga, tyrant,
your end is near!''
   Residents near the Defense Forces headquarters heard the clatter
of light arms fire inside the walled compound beginning at about
8:15 a.m. It continued for at least half an hour.
   An hour after the shooting stopped, Noriega appeared on the
stairs on one side of the building, dressed in civilian clothes and
accompanied by members of his high command.
   ``They were kisses,'' he said when asked about the shooting.
   To questions from reporters about what had happened, he replied:
``What happened is that you are visiting us here.''
   A communique by the Defense Forces said ``an attempt by several
officers to take over the headquarters of our institution was
foiled. The attempt was an isolated action that was repressed by
the officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the
institution.''
   Among those arrested, the communique said, were Macias; Majs.
Fernando Quezada, Aristedes Valdonedo and Jaime Benitez and Capt.
Humberto Macias.
   The statement said ``most of the officers involved in this
attempt were returned recently to the country after taking
specialized courses in different military installations of the
United States, where they were influenced and compromised into
betraying the oath they had given to the Defense Forces and the
fatherland.
   ``Troops loyal to the commander in in chief, in a quick action,
repressed and controlled the situation, thus avoiding bloodshed.''
   Earlier, soldiers stopped Associated Press reporters Eloy O.
Aguilar and Pauline Jelinek and photographer Diana Smith as they
drove up to the heavily guarded headquarters, forced them from the
car at gunpoint and marched them into the compound.
   They saw guards lead an officer with his hands behind his head
into a barracks.
   A captain told the journalists, who were later released, that
the man was taking part ``in a simulated exercise'' of taking
prisoners.
   The captain would not identify himself.
   Hundreds of soldiers surrounded the headquarters in one of the
older, poorer sections of Panama City. Residents were kept away.
   The U.S. Southern Command put its 10,000 military personnel and
their dependents on the highest security alert, ordering Americans
``not to go into public areas except for essential business.''
   Officials of the canal commission said in Washinton that roads
to the canal were blocked and the Panamanian military closed the
entrance to a U.S. air base near the canal administrative
headquarters in Balboa.
   Dennis P. McAuliffe, administrator of the commission, said he
``would not regard (the blockade) as a hostile act at this moment.''

   Paul Simon's favorite-son primary victory
revived talk of a deadlocked Democratic convention on Wednesday,
but non-candidate Mario Cuomo condemned the possibility as ``the
best way to give this election away to the Republicans.''
   The New York governor joined party chief Paul Kirk in calling
for the Democratic leadership to meet and unify behind the
front-runner at the end of the primary season in June, rather than
wait until the July convention in Atlanta.
   Simon pulled his campaign back from the brink of extinction with
the Illinois primary win on Tuesday, with fellow favorite son Jesse
Jackson running second. Simon took the lion's share of the
delegates, with Jackson winning the rest, shutting out delegate
front-runner Michael Dukakis.

   The housing industry, after staggering for two
months following the October stock market crash, enjoyed a sharp
8.9 percent increase in construction activity in February, the
biggest gain in more than a year, the government reported Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said the increase pushed construction of
single-family homes and apartments up to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.49 million units last month following declines of
15.8 percent in December and 1.9 percent in January.
   Those back-to-back setbacks, coupled with three consecutive
monthly declines in new home sales, had raised concerns because
housing is often the first industry to weaken at the onset of a new
recession. Economists feared that potential home buyers had grown
wary following the record collapse of the stock market in October.

   Hopes for an end to the war in Afghanistan have
focused attention on talks in Geneva this week, but more is at
stake than the Soviet Union's military withdrawal from the
9-year-old conflict.
   The Kremlin's apparent willingness to extract its estimated
115,000 troops may signal a broader policy change in the
superpower's role in foreign revolutions.
   Should an acceptable retreat be found from Afghanistan and the
conflict between pro- and anti-Communist forces be left to the
Afghans, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev would heal one of his
nation's most visible foreign policy sores. He also could improve
relations with the United States, China, the Indian subcontinent
and the Moslem world.

<HEAD>New Polish Ambassador Trying to Mend Ties Shattered by Martial Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jan Kinast left his post at the Polish Embassy
in Washington 20 years ago little dreaming he would return this
winter trying to mend relations shattered by martial law and a
foreign debt that is still rising.
   ``I keep pretty busy,'' says Kinast, a junior diplomat at the
Polish Embassy in Washington 1964-68 and Poland's first ambassador
to the United States since the military crackdown against the
independent Solidarity trade union in December 1981. Kinast's
predecessor, Romuald Spasowski, defected to protest martial law.
   So far, Kinast is having better luck winning friends for Poland
among America's officials than its businessmen and bankers.
   ``We are delighted with Ambassador Kinast,'' said Deputy
Secretary of State John Whitehead, who has traveled twice to Poland
since martial law was lifted in 1983. Whitehead, in a telephone
interview, described Kinast's immediate previous post, deputy
foreign minister, as analagous to his own job as No. 2 in the State
Department.
   Kinast, like many Poles, is a chain smoker, and nicotine stains
the thick glasses through which he pores over reams of finanicial
statistics.
   Poland's foreign debt, which was $25.5 billion in 1981, rose to
$39. billion by Dec. 31, 1987, driven higher by the collapsing
dollar and a lack of quality exports.
   The Reagan administration has lifted the freeze it imposed on
new credits to Poland during martial law, but Poland is still such
a bad risk that Western bankers balk at offering any new loans.
   John Davis Jr., who just became the first U.S. ambassador to
Poland since 1982, said in a televised interview last week that
Polish authorities appeared genuinely interested in economic
reforms.
   ``If economic reform is in place, and we see that it is in
place, it may be that there are some opportunities for joint
ventures, or other means of being helpful,'' said Davis.
   Poland took one step toward better relations with the United
States by closing down a business enterprise affiliated with the
Abu Nidal terrorist organization last fall and ordering the two men
in charge to leave Poland in January. U.S. anti-terrorism experts
say they are watching the situation carefully.
   And U.S. officials say more American help might be forthcoming
if Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski reached political
accommodation with Solidarity and Poland's Roman Catholic Church.
   ``I think that U.S. help would follow liberalization,'' Davis
said in an interview broadcast from Warsaw by ABC-TV.
   The billions of dollars Poland received in credit in the 1970's,
Davis said, ``went down the drain through a combination of bad luck
and bad management,'' creating the economic crisis that spawned
Solidarity in August 1980.
   But Kinast said in a recent interview in his Washington office
that Poland is looking not for new long-term credits but for
short-term commercial credits to facilitate transactions.
   ``Ninety-five percent of our (foreign) purchases are cash,'' he
said. ``No other country in the world is buying machines and
durable goods for cash.''
   A Polish trade delegation which visited Washington Feb. 14 for
the 10th session of the Joint American-Polish Trade Commission _
the first such meeting since 1981 _ went home with friendly words
instead of dollars.
   One deal under discussion is the purchase or rental by Poland's
state-owned Lot airlines of two or three jets from Boeing Corp. The
planes would fly between U.S. cities and Warsaw, and money from
tickets sold in the United States would pay for the planes, say
Polish officials.
   There are geopolitical overtones in Poland's latest turn toward
the West. Lot grounded its fleet of eight Soviet-made Ilyushin 62
jets, the best Moscow has to offer, after one crashed last May near
Warsaw, killing all 183 people aboard.
   A government commission blamed a faulty roller bearing for the
crash, Poland's worst, and the weekly Przeglad Tygodniowy recently
complained that the IL-62 is more costly to operate, and requires
more maintenance, than other jetliners.
   Kinast said that Poland, like other Soviet bloc countries, is
seeking joint ventures with the West, and may be willing to waive
previous requirements, allowing private Polish firms to take part,
allowing the Western firm to own more than half the joint venture,
and relaxing rules and taking hard currency out of Poland.
   Poland is seeking Western help in the agricultural sector, as
well. On Feb. 20, the The Foundation for the Development of Polish
Agriculture, created with the help of the Rockefeller Brothers'
Fund, was opening up a $2.4 million-line of credit for private
farmers in Poland to stimulate the export of hams.

<HEAD>Pastor-Congregation Conflicts Are Common Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICKI BROWN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two weeks after he became pastor of a
Southern Baptist church in west-central Illinois, the Rev. Gerald
Price said he knew the congregation might end up firing him.
   It did.
   Getting along with a congregation is a common challenge for
clergy, particularly in the Baptist system.
   The congregation which ousted Price, he found later, had fired
five previous staff members. It was plagued with financial problems
and had split over the issue of speaking in tongues.
   Price, who now is minister of education at Park Avenue Baptist
Church here, said being fired devastated him and his family. But he
said he found comfort in Scripture and help from friends and family
in relocating.
   The Southern Baptist Convention, in which churches have local
autonomy and can simply fire a pastor, has concluded the problem is
severe enough to set up a special program to help fired pastors.
   Other denominations have found that maintaining good relations
between the pastor and congregation, as well as among members,
often takes some effort. But in most denominations, a pastor can't
simply be fired by the congregation.
   The Southern Baptist Sunday School Board research department
discovered in 1984 that 88 ministers were fired by their churches
each month, said Norris Smith, who coordinates a program to help
fired ministers.
   ``We found that pastors who had been terminated had great need,
both for a job and emotional support,'' Smith said. ``Being
terminated does not change that pastor's internal spiritual
awareness that God has called him into the ministry.''
   Previously, he said, there was no clear place for pastors to
turn for financial or emotional help.
   Smith tries to make sure they receive counseling if they need
it, and seeks to put them in touch with others who can help in
finding another job, if it appears they were unjustly fired. State
conventions have funds to help with financial needs.
   Smith works with churches such as Highview Baptist in
Louisville, Ky., and First Baptist Church of Orlando, Fla., which
have established temporary paid staff positions to help terminated
ministers rebuild their careers.
   In the Methodist, Episcopal, Roman Catholic and Lutheran
churches, severe problems between a pastor and church are referred
to the bishop or someone else within the church hierarchy. Those
churches have structures to investigate problems and work to remedy
them.
   In the United Methodist Church, problems can be referred to a
pastor-parish relations committee, or the bishop. A Methodist
pastor can be transferred, or suspended, if convicted in a church
trial of some serious offense, such as immorality.
   In the Episcopal Church, pastors can be removed only through
joint action of the parish governing body, the vestry, and diocesan
bishop.
   The Rev. Patrick Connor, vicar general of the Nashville Catholic
Diocese, said problems between priest and congregation would go to
a parish-pastoral council and then the bishop, but a parish by
itself can't fire a priest.
   The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod has a full-time consultant on
a ``Peace in the Parish'' program, aimed at improving relations
between pastors and congregations and among members.
   The Rev. Norman Grotelusuhen, president of the denomination's
Mid-South District, said a congregation can fire a pastor for
particular causes, but he would investigate.
   ``If you can get in early enough, you usually can defuse it; if
you come in late, it will more likely lead to a termination,'' he
said.
   ``Sometimes it's the pastor's fault, sometimes the church,'' he
said. Problems can arise over the pastor not spending enough time
visiting the sick and bereaved, or having difficulty administering
congregational affairs.
   The Rev. James Qualben, a Lutheran, has for three years
conducted sessions on such problems with church officials and
ministers from Lutheran, Episcopal and Methodist churches.
   He said that when he is asked to help resolve a problem in a
congregation, he starts by reviewing its value system, and how past
difficulties may come back as old angers and old hurts operating
within the congregation.
   ``I went to one church that had split over slavery in 1872,'' he
said. ``The descendants of the slavery congregation still sit on
one side of the church, while the descendants of the non-slavery
congregation still sit on the other side.''
   Qualben said he tries to help the church get a longer range
perspective for making wise decisions and coping with the past
without hoarding hurts.
   But eliminating all conflict doesn't square with human nature,
he said. ``If the absence of conflict is the mark of a successful
church then the disciples never qualified.''
   But he said conciliating efforts often bring ``new life, new
vitality of mutual ministry in the church.''

   An official team of Lutheran and Roman
Catholic scholars says it is working toward agreements on the role
of Mary and the saints in Christian faith.
   A key issue of the Protestant Reformation was Roman Catholic
belief in prayers ``invoking the intercession'' of Mary and the
saints. Protestants contended this obscured the primacy of Christ
as mediator for humanity.
   At a meeting here, members of the Lutheran-Catholic dialogue
team said they expected to publish their conclusions in 1989. The
team previously agreed that Mary was a model of faith, devotion and
spirituality.

<HEAD>Over 50 Years, Refuge Helped Save Whooping Cranes From Extinction</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ARANSAS NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When three
whooping cranes flew out of a tidal marsh, sounds of awe mixed with
the clicking of cameras on the deck of the Lucky Day.
   The three birds made up nearly 2 percent of the entire
population of their kind.
   ``Flying whooping cranes at 9 o'clock,'' Capt. Harry Sloat told
the 80 passengers, his second tour group of the day on the Gulf
Intracoastal Waterway. ``They're showing off their wing tips for
you.''
   Each year, it gets a little easier to spot the birds at the
Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, which is celebrating its 50th
aniversary.
   There are about 195 whoopers in the world today; in 1941, the
population had dwindled to 15. The decline came as habitats were
developed for farms and cities, while hunters helped to nearly
finish off the species.
   Whooping cranes made Aransas famous, but when Congress created
the coastal preserve in 1937, the legislation did not mention the
bird known scientifically as Grus americana.
   ``This refuge was not established to protect whooping cranes,''
said refuge biologist Tom Stehn. ``It was established to protect
waterfowl habitat.''
   The government saw the need to protect less spectacular game
birds, such as ducks and geese. Whooping cranes just happened to be
lucky enough to share the same area during the winter.
   Their precarious situation by 1945 prompted the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and National Audubon Society to work on rescuing
the birds from extinction.
   ``Without the Aransas refuge, I think it's pretty evident the
whooping crane would have become extinct,'' Stehn said, while
observing an unusual gathering of 14 whoopers in the same field.
   He called it ``just phenomenal to be able to see that many
whooping cranes from one location, to think that at one point there
were only 15 in the entire flock.''
   Scientists don't think the whooping crane population ever
exceeded 5,000, he said.
   Only about 8,000 acres on the refuge provide the marshy winter
habitat whooping cranes use to look for food including plants,
clams, snakes, crabs, snails, fish, worms and insects.
   Several other endangered species make the refuge their home.
They include the bald eagle, brown pelican, peregrine falcon,
Attwater's prairie chicken, jaguarundi and Eskimo curlew.
   The Texas whooping crane flock numbers 132 this year, a 79
percent increase in four years. Virtually all are on or near the
54,829-acre refuge.
   They migrate each winter to Texas from Canada's Wood Buffalo
National Park 2,400 miles away.
   Eighteen to 20 whoopers live among sandhill cranes that migrate
between Gray's Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho and New
Mexico's Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. They were
introduced as chicks into the sandhill families, but none have
started breeding.
   A third group of 41 lives in captivity at the Fish and Wildlife
Service's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland. Lone
specimens of whooping crane also live at the San Antonio Zoo and
the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis.
   With their population steadily growing, the Texas whoopers have
started spreading to a 44,000-acre state park and refuge on nearby
Matagorda Island. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is buying an
additional 11,502 acres at the southern end of Matagorda from The
Nature Conservancy. That will add important new habitat as the
territorial whooping cranes spread out.
   ``We're really encouraged by the land that they're adding''
because wildlife is rapidly losing ground, said Jesse Grantham,
biologist and manager for the National Audubon Society's Texas
sanctuaries. ``We're not creating habitat. We're just saving little
pieces of what's left.''
   Whooper pairs, mated for life, stake out winter territories and
return to the same claims each year.
   The birds stand nearly 5 feet tall and have wings spanning about
7{ feet. Adults are snowy white, with black wingtips and red crowns
on their heads. Immature whooping cranes are rusty red and white
with black wing tips. Males breed at about the age 3, while females
wait until they're about 5.
   In Rockport, where Sloat's Lucky Day and four other whooping
crane tour boats are based, the endangered bird means money for the
local economy.
   Just a couple of years ago, only two whooping crane boats were
operating.
   ``You have people that are staying in motels and eating and
seeing other things while they are here'' to see the whooping
cranes, said Bob Lynch, executive vice president of the
Rockport-Fulton Chamber of Commerce. ``It has an economic impact on
our community, there's no doubt.''
   Some estimate the refuge brings up to $5 million to the local
economy.
   Refuge officials, however, worry about its location on the Gulf
Intracoastal Waterway, a man-made channel that cuts right through
the whooping crane habitat.
   Some 1,485 acres of habitat have been lost since 1941 due to
construction of the canal and erosion caused by boat wakes.
   Regular barge traffic leaves oil, grease, cadmium, arsenic,
nickel and mercury, while many of the barges carry deadly cargo.
   ``There is some nasty stuff going through that canal,'' said
refuge manager Brent Giezentanner. ``You're carrying very toxic
chemicals within 100 yards of the cranes. If we have one barge
break open some time, we potentially could have a major portion of
the whooping crane habitat contaminated.''

   Remember 20 years ago? Black-and-white
television, the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Martin Luther
King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, campus unrest, sexual revolution,
hippies, flower children?
   Other events shook the earth, too. Growing up, for instance.
   In ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' Kevin Arnold is 12 years old in
1968. He has to be careful of the neighborhood bully, namely his
older brother. His father is a distant figure who shows up now and
then to straighten him out. The offstage narrator is Kevin as a
grownup, looking back and remembering. Of course, remembering it in
his own fashion.
   ``The Wonder Years,'' simply put, is wonderful. Every adult out
there who has ever grown up will identify with this awkward age.
   Fred Savage stars as Kevin, Jason Hervey is his older brother,
Wayne, and Olivia D'Abo is his sister, Karen. The midseason
replacement series being given a limited trial by ABC has been
given a Tuesday night spot between ``Who's The Boss'' and
``Moonlighting.''
   ``1968 was a year when a lot of amazing things took place,''
said Carol Black, creator and executive producer with her husband,
Neal Marlens. Marlens also created ABC's ``Growing Pains.''
   ``We were about that age that year. There were a lot of really
disruptive events in the background of a kid's life.''
   Marlens said, ``It's different when you're 12. You know things
are happening, but you're not quite sure about them. It struck us
as an interesting time. There were already retrospectives about
people who were a little older, like `The Big Chill.'''
   ``When you're young you don't have a context in which to place
things,'' Black added. `It's just part of the world. It's a time
when you get your first impression of life.''
   It's also a time when a self-conscious 12-year-old is more
interested in figuring out how he fits in. You can put it into
context later. At 12 you just want to blend in.
   Black admits ``The Wonder Years'' is not really about the 1960s.
`It's the problems a kid has with his older brother, his father,
his girlfriend,'' she said. ``The period is more of a backdrop than
the essence of the show.''
   Black and Marlens share common backgrounds. Both were raised in
the suburbs, he outside New York City and she outside Washington,
D.C. Both had older brothers. They met while students at Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania.
   They started writing together about 6 years ago. He was working
as a newspaper reporter in Massachusetts and she was a graduate
student.
   ``We wrote a spec script for `Barney Miller,' which had just
gone off the air,'' said Marlens. ``We felt it was better to write
for a show that wasn't on the air. It got good response.''
   Marlens wrote for ``Oh Madeline'' and ``Newhart.'' Then he
created ``Growing Pains'' while Black wrote the movie ``Soul Man.''
Actually, they worked together on both projects, but thought it
best to separate the credit.
   They also stress that ``The Wonder Years'' is not
autobiographical.
   ``I was never a 12-year-old boy,'' said Black. ``And Neal was
never this particular 12-year-old boy.''
   ``We make up the specifics,'' said Marlens, ``but we do use
incidents from our lives and those of our friends. It's the story
of a family, but it's seen from the viewpoint of the boy.
   ``We didn't set out to do anything deep. `Leave It To Beaver' in
its day was well thought out. But I think audiences today want to
be challenged by something more substantial. We grew up in a
controversial period and we're more prone to writing that way. But
there are some things about growing up that never change. Things
that happened to the Cleavers could happen to the Arnolds, too.''

   As they file their tax returns this year, many
savers and investors are making a decision by omission _ skipping
any contribution for 1987 to their individual retirement accounts.
   A recent study commissioned by Fidelity Investments found that
less than half the respondents with IRAs from previous years
planned to add any money to them this time around.
   Their reasoning isn't hard to understand. The tax deduction for
contributions has been eliminated for anybody covered by an
employer's retirement plan who has income of $35,000 or more
($50,000 for married couples filing joint returns).
   In the $25,000-$35,000 income range ($40,000 to $50,000 for
married couples), only part of the contribution is deductible.
   All working Americans are still eligible to put up to $2,000
each year in an IRA, whether they can claim the deduction or not.
The interest, dividends or capital gains their money earns can
still compound without being taxed until withdrawals from the
account begin.
   However, money invested in an IRA _ including non-deductible
contributions _ can't be withdrawn before the year in which you
reach age 59{ without incurring a penalty tax.
   Why tie the money up, people seem to be concluding, if the
incentive of the up-front deduction no longer exists? Besides, the
new rules have taken the simplicity of the old system and replaced
it with a lot of paperwork hassles.
   What's the point of spending extra time or professional
preparers' fees on a venture whose after-tax value is less than it
was before?
   These are sensible questions, to be sure. But some advisers
suggest that many people who are no longer eligible for IRA
deductions give the matter some extra consideration.
   After all, they say, no matter what happens with the tax law,
the need to save and plan for retirement hasn't changed.
   ``The discipline of automatic, annual contributions is
especially useful to people who spend instead of save,'' says
Wallace Head, tax partner at the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen
& Co.
   ``They need only ask themselves if they can afford to invest
cash for many years. If the answer is yes, IRAs should be
considered an effective investment.''
   For anyone who does make non-deductible contributions, good
record-keeping is a must to avoid paying taxes on that money twice
_ now, and again when you make withdrawals from the account.
   The Internal Revenue Service requires that any non-deductible
contributions be reported on the new Form 8606, which the taxpayer
attaches to his or her return for the year in question.
   You will probably want to save a file of extra copies of Form
8606s for 1987 and subsequent years, or start a notebook, to serve
as documentation for when you start taking money out of your IRA.
   Although this paperwork may be burdensome, it can make a big
difference in the taxes you will have to pay in the future.
   Suppose at some point around the year 2000 you have accumulated
$100,000 in an IRA, of which $25,000 came from non-deductible
contributions, and you want to withdraw $20,000 from the account.
   Since 25 percent of the total value of your IRA is money that
has already been taxed, having the proper records will enable you
to establish that you owe taxes on only $15,000 of the
distribution, rather than the full $20,000.

   Americans are accustomed to hearing Federal
Reserve chiefs discourse on the threat of inflation, but some might
have been mystified by Alan Greenspan's reference to it this week.
   Greenspan told Congress that a further decline in the jobless
rate, now 5.7 percent, might produce upward pressure on wages _
and, since wages are a large constituent of prices, the probability
of inflation.
   How can that be, many Americans are asking?
   How can there be a worker shortage when 7 million members of the
labor force are without jobs? How can there be a labor shortage
when the jobless rate is so much above the old 4 percent ``full
employment'' standard?
   And how can inflation, which is usually associated with a
boiling economy, be a threat at a time when expansion is so
sluggish at times it takes the most sophisticated statistical
measures to catch any movement at all?
   Greenspan's reference to the subject is bound to be passed off
by some as a mere requirement of the office, a ritual expression
that is now expected of a Fed chairman, since his predecessor had
made it the No. 1 enemy.
   But there is more to it than that.
   The most significant ``more'' involves a better understanding of
market forces than existed back in the 1960s, when it was generally
believed that unemployment could drop to 4 percent before inflation
flared.
   Experience taught otherwise, as witness the decade of inflation
that followed in the 1970s.
   The second ``more'' involves the makeup of the labor force.
   In the 1960s, the economy had lots of younger workers to fill
the beginning jobs. In the 1980s there are fewer labor-force
entrants. And Congress is considering sharp increases in the
minimum wage.
   Stated differently, most of those who are available to take jobs
today are older and more experienced and thus come at higher
prices. You don't need a decline to 4 percent before worrying about
inflation. You worry at 5 percent.
   In truth, there is no certainty among economists on the point at
which a falling jobless rate becomes inflationary. Clearly, they
were wrong in putting it at 4 percent in the 1960s, because
double-digit inflation ensued.
   It can be argued, therefore, that it is merely wisdom and
responsibility that causes a Fed chief always to be vigilant, and
for him to act on the theory it is wiser to ward off inflation than
to treat the infection later.
   Greenspan told Congress that in his opinion the country is
getting close to the point at which inflation could be ignited.
   ``Certainly it's less than a percentage point,'' he said, adding
that it was his impression that the flare point was ``closer to a
half, and maybe somewhat less than that.''
   Is he premature in his concern?
   Hardly, if you consider that the last big bout of inflation was
one of the worst and longest the country has ever experienced, and
that it took a harsh recession to defeat it.
   Consider also that a case of inflation in the range of 6 percent
_ mild, when compared with the double-digit disasters of the 1970s
_ can cut in half the value of everyone's money in a dozen years.

   The destruction of millions of acres of
tropical jungles each year by peasant farmers and others is a
problem for the developed nations as well as the Third World and
requires economic and educational solutions, say scientists at a
leading plant research institution.
   The Missouri Botanical Garden, known for its man-made tropical
atmosphere in the so-called ``Climatron'' designed by Buckminster
Fuller, is working to halt the decimation of the world's real
tropical jungles.
   ``The outlook is pretty grim,'' said biologist Peter H. Raven,
director of the garden. ``Although tropical forests once covered at
least 12 percent of the globe _ an area about twice the size of
Europe _ they have already been reduced to about half that.''
   ``Currently, the forests are being cleared or degraded at the
rate of about 60 million acres a year. That's an area about half
the size of California.''
   Raven said roughly half of all known plant and animal species on
Earth are found in the tropical forests. At the current rate of
destruction, as many as 60,000 species of plants will be extinct by
the year 2020.
   ``The plant-rich tropics supply man with a wealth of food crops,
medicines and other useful products,'' said Dr. Enrique Forero,
director of research at the garden. ``But they are being destroyed
rapidly.''
   The chief culprits, Forero said, are loggers and slash-and-burn
peasant farmers. The loggers obviously need the trees to stay in
business and the farmers often have to destroy the forests to feed
themselves and their families.
   And the scientists say the situation can only get worse unless
something is done to stop it.
   ``At present, over half the people in the world live in
countries that are at least partly tropical, excluding China,''
Forero said. ``Nearly a third of these people are already living in
extreme poverty and with current rates of growth, the human
population of these countries will double in less than 30 years.''
   ``How can you tell these starving people that you are going to
save the very things they have to destroy in order to sustain their
already meager existence,'' asked Raven. ``Education and political
and economic stability are obviously the keys. That and
understanding.''
   Which is why, Raven said, the garden has committed itself to an
all-out effort to explore, document and save the forests.
   With a staff of 70 researchers and technicians, including many
who live permanently in the tropics, the garden makes up one of the
world's largest active field research programs in tropical botany.
   The goals, the scientists said, are to collect the plant species
before they become extinct and to teach the impoverished farmers
how to live in the forest without destroying it.
   With the growing knowledge of genetics, they said, it is
important that the genes, the biological blueprints, of the
endangered species be saved.
   ``To lose this genetic capital through massive extinctions just
as we are developing our capabilities to explore its potential
would indeed be a tragedy,'' Raven said. ``The developments in
genetics make the specter of extinction even worse,'' Raven said.
``For each species of plant or animal lost to extinction, you're
losing the potential for another 20,000 to 30,000 variants in the
future.''
   Many of the plants, scientists say, could almost certainly be
developed into cheaper, easy-to-grow sources of highly nutritious
food. Others could be converted into abundant sources of new
medicines.
   Another important part of the garden's program is to lend
technical assistance to and train scientists from developing
tropical countries through cooperative agreements.
   ``Unfortunately, only 6 percent of the scientists working on the
problem live in the countries involved,'' Raven said. ``We must
change that. Momentum to implement the innovative conservation and
development strategies needed to deal with these urgent problems
ultimately must come from the affected countries themselves,''
Raven said.
   The backbone of the garden's research, the scientists said, is
its herbarium, or plant collection. Along with the New York
Botanical Garden and the Smithsonian Institution, the Missouri
herbarium is one of the three largest in the United States and
among the 12 largest in the world.
   Started by garden founder Henry Shaw in the 1850s, the Missouri
herbarium now contains samples of more than 3.5 million species and
is expected to expand to 4.5 million within the next decade.
   Pointing to a large map showing the locations of the garden's
researchers in Central and South America and Africa, Raven said of
the encroachment on the forests: ``It won't be stopped soon.
   ``But there are encouraging signs. What people have to learn is
that conservation and development are really two sides of the same
coin.''
   ``Producers and consumers have to learn that they have a common
problem. It can all be done, but it won't be easy.''

   Twenty years after a sniper's bullet felled Martin Luther King
Jr., his dream of equality and prosperity for American blacks still
shines like a beacon. Despite some remarkable progress, however,
for too many it remains only a dream. The first story of three in a
series that assesses black progress in economics, politics and
social influence looks at a poor West Side Chicago neighborhood
where King lived in 1966 to wage war on slums and poverty.

   Bonnet Hampton knows what it's like to huddle in
bed with a baseball bat at hand, wondering how to protect her
babies from rats scurrying across the rotting wooden floor of her
tenement flat.
   She knows how to sidestep young men strung out on drugs huddled
in dingy hallways, and she's no longer shocked by dead bodies _
even at her doorstep.
   ``You don't get used to it,'' she said, ``but it's not a
nightmare. If you see someone get shot or stabbed today _ usually
you'd be nervous for days. It's not like that. ... It's just
another one. You don't lose any rest over that.''
   Hampton lives in North Lawndale. A generation ago, Martin Luther
King Jr. lived here in a four-room flat. King had come north to
wage war on poverty and inequality, but 20 years after his death,
the slums and disparity remain. So do dreams of a better life.
   This poor black community he adopted has become even poorer _
and that, say those who knew him, would grieve King if he were
alive today.
   ``If King were to look at Lawndale ... he'd think that his worst
nightmare had come true,'' said Gary Orfield, a University of
Chicago political science professor who did volunteer work with
King.
   Some residents reluctantly agree.
   ``I think he was great enough to know and powerful enough to
know his dream is not being fulfilled,'' said Cleodia Dawkins
O'Quinn, who welcomed King to her home. ``He would know we have
stepped backward.''
   Black poverty is a bleak fact of life. Nearly one in three
blacks _ 31.1 percent _ lived below the poverty line in 1986,
compared with 11 percent of whites, according to federal statistics.
   And 20 years after the Kerner Commission examined inner-city
problems following the mid '60s riots and warned the United States
was moving toward two societies, ``one black, one white _ separate
and unequal,'' the gap remains.
   Life for inner-city blacks has worsened, scholars said in a
follow-up study this year, partly because of industrial decline.
Over 35 years, Rust Belt cities have lost almost half their
manufacturing force, according to a report by the University of
Chicago's William Julius Wilson and Loic Wacquant.
   Chicago, the report said, lost half its manufacturing
blue-collar workers from 1967-82. And that's taken its toll on
North Lawndale. The neighborhood's misery index is high. According
to federal, city and state records:
   _ Four of ten people lived in poverty in 1980, an increase of a
third over a decade earlier.
   _ More than a third of the housing is uninhabitable or so
deteriorated it's beyond rehabilitation.
   _ Eight of 10 children are born out of wedlock. The 1986 infant
mortality rate, 27.2 per 1,000 live births, was more than 2{ times
the U.S. average.
   _ Women headed 61 percent of the households in 1980.
   _ One in five people was out of work in 1980. Unemployment, some
activists say, may now be as high as 30 percent.
   Much of North Lawndale has simply vanished. Since 1960, more
than half the residents, thousands of jobs and most industries have
fled. Gangs are more vicious, drugs more common.
   Still, optimists remain, proud, hard-working folks fighting to
turn things around. ``We have been at the lowest of low,'' said
Jesse Miller, head of the Lawndale Peoples Planning and Action
Conference, an activist group. ``The citizens of this community are
facing up to the problems.''
   But reversing those fortunes is a formidable task. North
Lawndale has block after block of weed-filled lots, gutted
buildings and men in their prime who while away their days
loitering on street corners or huddled around fires in garbage cans.
   ``You can't envision how it looked before,'' Mrs. O'Quinn said,
shaking her head sadly. ``It's a wilderness now.''
   Once a largely Jewish community with gray stone houses, stores,
factories and banks, North Lawndale turned from white to mostly
black in the 1950s. Absentee landlords and political neglect had
contributed to its decline by 1966 when King moved into a
$90-a-month, third-floor flat, with inadequate heat and halls
reeking of urine.
   ``You can't really get close to the poor without living and
being here with them,'' he said. King lived in the building, since
torn down, on and off for several months that year.
   King tried to fight slumlords, build tenant unions, end
discrimination. He led open-housing marches in all-white
neighborhoods and tried to be peacemaker when riots flared in the
summer of 1966.
   King, folks say, brought hope to North Lawndale. His
assassination brought destruction. Riots that tore apart U.S.
cities after King's death in 1968 unleashed a storm of rage here as
well _ the skies were ablaze, the streets filled with looters,
blocks of businesses turned to rubble, houses to ashes and dreams
to despair.

   ``The riots killed or ... almost mortally wounded the hope of
the community,'' said Primus Mootry, executive vice president of
the local Better Boys Foundation.
   ``There was no Marshall plan for this war-torn community. It was
as if someone decided to let them sit there in the mess that they
made and let them stew,'' he said. ``The consequences have been
devastating. The community has been damned from the outside.''
   Today, North Lawndale has 61,000 residents, less than half the
population of almost 125,000 in 1965. Much of the middle-class has
fled.
   ``If I had somewhere to go, I would have run, too,'' said
33-year resident Mildred Hunter.
   Tens of thousands of jobs also disappeared. Seventy-five percent
of businesses were lost from 1960 to 1970. International Harvester
Co. (now Navistar) closed a plant. Sears Roebuck & Co. later moved
its world headquarters out of North Lawndale, keeping only a
distribution and planning center.
   The main shopping strip, Roosevelt Road, remains a burned-out
shell. A proposal by a national organization of planners, builders,
bankers and others to build a $9.5 million shopping mall has been
postponed.
   After 25 years of ``uninterrupted decline, North Lawndale
resembles a war zone,'' Wilson and Wacquant said in their study.
   Today, the neighborhood has some food and liquor stores. To buy
anything else, ``you have to go an area you're not wanted to spend
your money,'' said Isabelle Burrell. ``It's insulting.''
   Shopping, however, seems like a minor problem against the drug
dealing, gangs and violence.
   Hampton, for example, a 30-year-old with three teen-agers and a
baby, has survived four apartments and 14 years of horror stories:
she's fended off giant rats slurping out of her toilet, been forced
out by an arsonist, witnessed a robbery, faced drug users shooting
up in the hallway and seen murder victims, including a decapitated
man.
   ``I've seen a lot of disaster,'' she said, adding that she
carries a knife by day, a gun at night. ``We have a lot of lunatics
out here.''
   Hampton talks about returning to her native Mississippi. In the
meantime, she attends church with her children, visits their
schools and preaches against drugs.
   ``They understand it,'' she said. ``They have seen it.''
   Others have, too. Residents can rattle off the corners where
drugs are sold like newspapers, customers pulling up in cars day
and night.
   ``The only game left is the drug game,'' said Leon Farley, an
unemployed counselor. ``To survive, to eat, to pay the rent. We
don't have a lot of jobs.''
   Drug trafficking wasn't always a problem, and the gangs of
decades past directed their violence at each other.
   ``They didn't bother those of us doing good things,'' said Mrs.
O'Quinn, who with her husband runs a drum and bugle corps for
youths. `The gangs don't respect anything now.''
   Mootry confirmed gangs are more lethal: zip guns, knives and
chains have been replaced by Uzi submachine guns and other
sophisticated weapons.
   Yet the biggest problem, he said, may be a perception among
youths that North Lawndale is ``an island ... a walled city (where)
nothing comes in and nothing comes out. That is the way in which
they are socialized. That's a great tragedy.''
   Mootry's organization tries to broaden horizons, offering
recreational and education programs, including scholarships that
have sent teens to Harvard and the University of Chicago. Block
clubs, slum-busting projects and infant health programs also have
been started.
   ``Because people live in the ghetto, you don't got to be dealing
in dope, be a prostitute or on public aid,'' said Hunter, the
long-time North Lawndale resident. ``You can live anywhere and be
what you want to be.''
   Some businesses have stayed afloat, too. The Community Bank of
Lawndale, which opened in 1977 with $2 million in assets, now has
$25 million.
   But Jim Hadley, senior vice president, said investors still
question the neighborhood's viability, despite its prime location
and good transportation.
   A main reason is housing shortages. Only 727 units have been
built since 1969, city officials say. Some federally subsidized
housing has been built and almost $7 million has been spent to
improve 5,000 units since 1983, they add.
   ``As long as you don't have any housing, you're not going to
have desirable residents,'' said resident Edward Manning. ``This
community is not going to be the way you'd like it to be anytime
soon.''
   Manning and others say a comeback depends on folks flexing
political muscle. For years, ``we didn't demand nothing and we
didn't get anything,'' he said.
   That, many say, changed with the 1983 election of Harold
Washington, the city's first black mayor who died last year and is
regarded in the same revered tones as King.
   Miller, who last Tuesday defeated the incumbent for the
Democratic ward committeeman post, says North Lawndale's problems
may be the same as they were a generation ago, except for one
difference: ``The political maturity is there now.''
   ``Lawndale was and is a very poor community,'' he said. If King
were alive, ``I think he'd be proud of the attitude of the
residents. There's still hope. There are still efforts ... to bring
Lawndale into the 20th century. I think we're very close.''

   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote of his experiences in
North Lawndale in his book ``Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos Or
Community?'' It was published in 1967.
   Here are a few excerpts:
   ``The phone rings daily with countless stories of man's
inhumanity to man, and I find myself struggling constantly against
the depression and hopelessness which the hearts of our cities pump
into the spiritual bloodstream of our lives.''

   ``The children's clothes are too skimpy to protect them from the
Chicago wind, and a closer look reveals the mucus in the corners of
their bright eyes, and you are reminded that vitamin pills and flu
shots are luxuries which they can ill afford. The `runny noses' of
ghetto children become a graphic symbol of medical neglect in a
society which has mastered most of the diseases from which they
will too soon die. There is something wrong in a society that
allows this to happen.''

   On his children's summertime experiences in the community:
   ``Their tempers flared and they sometimes reverted to almost

crowded, too devoid of creative forms of recreation. ... And I
understood anew the conditions which make of the ghetto an
emotional pressure cooker.''

   The ritual of the poor is conducted almost every
day at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's headquarters
here.
   They walk in and sit quietly on battered chairs, their eyes
scanning walls lined with photographs of Martin Luther King Jr.
marching along Alabama roads.
   They wait, sometimes for hours, hoping for help to find a job, a
home or a lost welfare check.
   ``They helped my sister last year when her lights was off, so I
was thinking they would help me find another place to stay _ you
know, a cheaper one,'' said Betty Mitchell, who works at a
fast-food restaurant and was waiting at the SCLC offices last week.
   But trying to meet such demands strains the financially strapped
organization and its skeleton crew, which struggles both to treat
the symptoms of poverty and find a cure for the disease.
   ``Oh, Lord, we get more requests than we can handle,'' said the
Rev. Joseph Lowery, SCLC president. ``We do what we can, but we
just don't have the staff to respond to all the cases.''
   The poor bring complaints about everything from police brutality
to housing and hiring practices, Lowery said.
   ``The major incidents, for example, are the violence of
minimum-wage jobs, or no jobs at all,'' Lowery said. ``The violence
of homelessness. The violence of being the last hired and first
fired.
   ``Most poor people are working; they simply don't earn enough to
get out of poverty.''
   The SCLC has tied itself to the needs of the needy since 1957,
when it was founded by King, Lowery and the Revs. Ralph Abernathy
and Fred Shuttlesworth to expand the non-violent movement against
legal segregation. Its eventual victory over discriminatory laws
earned the SCLC a reputation of militancy that holds to this day.
   ``We are the activist arm of the movement. When you do that, you
step on toes and you don't become the most popular kid on the
block,'' Lowery said. ``We know it's not as popular to give us
support as it is some other groups that are not as controversial.''
   The nation heard from the SCLC frequently last year as it spoke
out on issues it felt could jeopardize human rights. It organized
marches in virtually all-white Forsyth County, Ga.; helped
establish a biracial committee on race relations there; opposed
Judge Robert Bork's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court; condemned
statements about blacks in sports made by Al Campanis and Jimmy
``The Greek'' Snyder, and negotiated with major league groups to
move blacks into upper management.
   ``We still believe in the efficacy of conscience-working and
consciousness-raising and, if necessary, civil disobedience,''
Lowery said. ``We're going to have to continue to have advocacy
groups to keep pressure on _ creative, non-violent pressure. We
have to keep that alive.''
   The group, which lacks solid corporate support, operates from a
dingy brownstone in Atlanta's historic Auburn Avenue district. The
building has changed little since it was first occupied in 1962.
   ``This is Martin's desk,'' Lowery said, running his hand over
the cluttered, chipped wooden desk in his office. ``We have not put
thick carpets on the floor or lined the walls and ceilings with
chandeliers because that's not where our priorities are.''
   On April 4, the 20th anniversary of King's assassination, the
group will kick off its 1988 Poor People's Crusade with hearings on
homelessness and unemployment. It will also hold rallies, starting
in Memphis, Tenn., then sweeping through Alabama, Georgia and
Mississippi.
   The SCLC was ready to start a similar campaign when King was
gunned down at a Memphis hotel in 1968. Days later, SCLC members
dried their tears and marched on Washington, D.C., carrying
thousands of the nation's poor with them to dramatize poverty.
   This time around, the SCLC wants more than a display of what's
gone wrong with efforts to wipe out poverty, Lowery said.
   ``The crusade is trying to get poverty on the national agenda,''
Lowery said. ``Whoever comes into office (as president), we want
them to have a commitment to eliminating poverty and look at it as
the urgent, critical problem that it is.''
   Lowery said he hopes the campaign will change the recent
tendency to celebrate the national King holiday in January with
glitzy, ceremonial events that ignore the issues that dominated
King's life.
   ``We're beginning to honor Martin as a orator, as a dreamer, but
we're not honoring the message,'' Lowery said, glancing at a large
photograph of him talking with King in a church pulpit.
   ``You've got people now who are paying honor to him on that
holiday who are not doing anything about helping the poor or
working for economic justice.
   ``They say, `Dr. King this, Dr. King that,' then they don't
register to vote, they don't join a boycott, they don't work for
peace and human dignity.''

   Here are some statistics on black poverty and related issues:
   
   POVERTY:
   _ The national poverty rate for blacks in 1986 was 31.1 percent,
compared with 11 percent for whites, according to the Census
Bureau. The poverty rate is based on those people whose income
falls below a level determined by the federal government; the level
is $8,737 for a three-person family, and $11,203 for a four-person
family.
   _ In 1968, the year Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the
black poverty rate was 34.7 percent, compared with 10 percent for
whites.
   _ The Midwest had the highest proportion of blacks living below
the poverty line, 34.5 percent, in 1986, according to The State of
Black America, a series of reports published by the National Urban
League.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   UNEMPLOYMENT:
   _ The black unemployment rate in 1987 was 13 percent, 2{ times
the 5.3 percent for whites, the Census Bureau said.
   _ In 1968, before statistics were broken down for specific
racial or ethnic groups, all minority unemployment was 6.7 percent.
The white jobless rate was 3.2 percent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   INCOME:
   _ Median family income for blacks has increased every year since
the recession-fueled low point of 1982, the Urban League said.
However, the average median black family income throughout the
1980s is $16,476, compared with $17,765 for the 1970s.
   _ In a single year, 1986, median black family income was
$17,604, compared with $30,809 for whites.
   _ In 1986, 44.2 percent of black families had incomes of less
than $10,000, compared with 13.7 percent of white families.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CHILDREN:
   _ In 1986, 42.7 percent of all black children under 18 years of
age were officially classified as poor. The comparable figure for
white children was 15.3.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CITIES:
   _ From 1970 to 1980, the number of people living below the
poverty line in the cores of the nation's 10 largest cities
increased by 19 percent, from 3.1 million to 3.8 million, according
to a University of Chicago study by Loic Wacquant and William
Julius Wilson.
   The increase, the study said, was due entirely to increased
poverty among minorities. The cities measured were the largest as
of 1970 _ New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore,
Dallas, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Los Angeles and Houston.
   _ In the 1970-80 decade, the number of poor people rose 30
percent in Los Angeles, 24 percent in Chicago, 20 percent in New
York City and 16 percent in Philadelphia, the study said.
   The proportion of blacks living in extremely poor neighborhoods
doubled in Chicago and tripled in New York City from 1970 to 1980.

<HEAD>Farm Policy Naps But Will Flex Muscles Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This may be a sleep time for great
agricultural crusades in Washington, at least until after the
November elections.
   A widely reported financial recovery in the farm sector, new
credit legislation, rising agricultural exports, and the
approaching busy time of another spring have dulled the swords of
challenge.
   One of the last hints of battle on behalf of producers was put
aside 10 days ago by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., who announced he
had no further plans to seek changes in the current soybean program.
   There was simply ``a lack of consensus'' on how to proceed on a
proposed marketing loan program for soybeans, Glickman said. The
American Soybean Association, in fact, had asked that no changes be
made.
   But an attempt was made last week to include a ``triggered''
marketing loan program in the thousand-page trade bill being
negotiated by House and Senate conferees. Marketing loans, already
in effect for some commodities, provide crop support at U.S. price
levels, allowing farmers to repay the loans at world prices, with
taxpayers making up the difference.
   The marketing loan approach would be triggered for wheat, corn
and soybeans if trade negotiations fail to reduce world
agricultural subsidies by 1990. Administration officials have
indicated President Reagan might veto the trade bill if such a
measure is included.
   Congress in December passed landmark legislation on farm credit,
providing some financial relief to thousands of sorely pressed
families. And a $76 billion budget-cutting package included
reductions and other adjustments in farm program loan rates and
target prices through the 1990 crops.
   Thus, except for the possibility of changes in the sugar program
or sudden tinkering with dairy, the remainder of 1988 may be a
legislative yawner for farm folk.
   But in 1989 _ with a new administration and Congress _ the
debate will begin again, this time on 1990 legislation to amend,
replace or extend the current Food Security Act of 1985.
   The Reagan administration's philosophy for more than seven years
has been in support of ``market-oriented'' agricultural policy,
which the 1985 law, within specific limits, has allowed. The
reduction in crop price support rates, a lowering of milk supports,
and other adjustments are examples of the flexibility permitted in
the current law.
   Critics have proposed more of a ``supply management'' texture to
U.S. farm policy, some advocating the direct role of farmers in
determining how far to go.
   The 1990 farm bill debate will pit old adversaries, or at least
their ideas, some of which have long outlived their progenitors.
   Don Paarlberg, professor emeritus at Purdue University, was a
young farmer with his father and brother at the beginning of the
Great Depression, when farm commodity prices dropped 56 percent
from 1929 to 1932, and land values plummeted by more than half.
   Paarlberg much later held posts in the administrations of three
Republican presidents: Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford. He has been
recognized for decades as one of the nation's foremost agricultural
economists and farm policy experts.
   Last fall Paarlberg wrote an article for IMPRIMIS, the monthly
journal of Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, Mich., in which he
recounted those early Depression years on the northwestern Indiana
farm. He described the differing schools of economic thought that
prevailed at the time.
   One school was led by George F. Warren of Cornell University,
who thought the farm problem was general, resulting from the
collapse of money and credit. Warren thought the remedy lay in
revised monetary policy. Paarlberg agreed.
   The other school, led by John D. Black of Harvard University,
held that agriculture itself was to blame because of surplus
production. The remedy consisted of reducing supplies so that
prices would improve.
   As it happened, the New Deal farm program was built upon the
latter philosophy and was a ``major change in the farm policy
agenda,'' Paarlberg said. For 70 years prior to the onset of New
Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration in 1933, there had
been a ``historic agenda based on increased production, individual
farmer decision and competitive markets,'' he said.
   Paarlberg said the key words for the new farm policy were
relief, recovery and reform.
   ``I recall well the revival of hope on the farm front that
accompanied passage of New Deal farm programs,'' he wrote.
``Farmers were given a role in working out their own chosen
solutions to their problems. They were put on committees by the
thousands. They elected officers, attended meetings and spoke their
minds.''
   Paarlberg added: ``Government checks began to flow. The
hemorrhage of farm foreclosures began to abate. On every hand was
evidence that the government cared. The Great Depression dragged
on, but the mood changed for the better on American farms.''
   But recovery was only partial seven years after passage of the
initial New Deal programs. Complete agricultural recovery from the
depression of the 1930s ``must ge credited more to the stimulus of
(World War II) than to management of supply and price,'' he said.
   Important traits of the New Deal programs persisted beyond their
usefulness, Paarlberg said.
   ``Reform was, for the greater part, aborted,'' he said. ``The
agricultural elite, generally the large landowners, managed to
retain most of the program benefits themselves rather than share
them with tenants or employees.
   The modern Farmers Home Administration, for example, is a
descendant of the Resettlement Administration and the Farm Security
Administration, agencies created to bring relief to impoverished
farmers.
   But the FmHA today ``has been co-opted by the agricultural
establishment,'' Paarlberg said.
   ``The New Deal farm programs, intended to lift average farm
income, actually widened the income gap between the top and bottom
economic groups,'' he said. ``Relief was achieved, recovery
occurred for other reasons, and reform miscarried.''
   In their modern form, government farm programs cannot be called
New Deal programs because ``they have been adopted by most of the
Republican farm politicians,'' Paarlberg said.
   ``As an observer, I can no longer find credible differences in
the Congress between the farm policies of the two major parties,''
he said.
   Yet, when programs persist so long, it can be virtually
impossible to root them out or even change them substantially.
   ``If the programs are to be cut back and reformed, the effort
will have to be applied from outside the farm sector,'' Paarlberg
said. ``The farm lobby will never discipline itself.''

   Oil prices have rebounded slightly, although
analysts say trading remains cautious and light.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for April
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose
9 cents to settle at $15.68 per barrel Tuesday.
   The contract fell 70 cents Monday in response to reports that
Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, had rejected calls for new restrictions on
crude production.
   WTI rose above $16 late last week after OPEC members called for
a meeting of the cartel's pricing committee to stabilize market
prices. Officials of non-OPEC producers also met to discuss similar
concerns.
   Analysts said they didn't know what to make of Tuesday's
rebound. Prices began lower but moved higher later in the session.
   ``I think that what you're seeing here is a reassessment of the
market,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of Elders Futures
Inc. ``I'm not saying that means it's a positive reassessment.
There's a lot of uncertainty right now in the market.''
   Wholesale gasoline for April delivery, down 1.23 cents on
Monday, rose 0.02 cent to 44.38 cents per gallon on Tuesday.
Wholesale heating oil gained 0.13 cent to 43.47 cents per gallon,
after falling 1.35 cents in the previous session.

<HEAD>Shareholders Take Their Time in Deciding Between Campeau and Macy</HEAD>

   Federated Department Stores Inc. shareholders
apparently are not rushing to decide between the competing tender
offers of R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. and Campeau Corp.
   Campeau announced Tuesday that 2.4 million Federated shares had
been tendered to the Toronto-based developer but not withdrawn by
the close of business on Monday.
   Campeau's offer of $75 cash per share for 70.5 million Federated
shares was to expire at midnight EST Friday, although a federal
judge has extended that deadline into next week.
   Macy, whose $77.35 a share offer for 70.43 million Federated
shares expires April 4, declined to announce how many shares it had
received. Maureen Milano, a spokeswoman for the retailer, said
figures usually are not announced until after an offer's expiration.
   Federated stock fell 50 cents to $65.50 a share in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading on Tuesday.
   The number of shares tendered to Campeau, which represents less
than 4 percent of the company's goal, indicates shareholders might
be waiting to see what will happen next in the battle for Federated.
   The focus of attention was federal court in Manhattan, where
U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand was considering the validity of
Federated's ``poison pill'' shareholders rights plan and the
expiration date of the Campeau bid.
   During a hearing late Monday, Macy asked Sand to delay
expiration of Campeau's offer by 20 days to lessen the pressure on
Federated shareholders to accept the hostile bid.
   Macy contended the Campeau offer, which was amended from an
earlier proposal, actually was a new offer and under federal law
would have to remain open past its planned Friday expiration.
   Sand was seeking an opinion from the Securities and Exchange
Commission on the Macy argument and said he would not rule before
today.
   Sand also was considering Campeau's challenge to the poison
pill, which Federated's board approved in January before Campeau
made its hostile bid and after developer Donald Trump indicated
interest in the nation's fifth-largest retailer.
   The plan allows current Federated shareholders to buy more of
the company's stock at a steep discount during a hostile takeover,
making a takeover prohibitively expensive.
   Campeau says its bid cannot proceed while the poison pill is in
effect.
   Sand said both buyout offers would have to remain open at least
three business days after he ruled on the poison pill, meaning
Campeau's offer must now remain open into next week.
   On Monday, Macy sweetened its merger agreement with Federated by
$200 million in cash to a total of $6.3 billion. Macy is offering
$77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 million Federated shares, up from
its original $74.50 per share. Macy will exchange shares in the
merged company and issue convertible debt securities for the
remainder of Federated's 89.5 million outstanding shares.
   Campeau is offering $75 in cash per share for 70.5 million
Federated shares. The remaining of Federated stock would be
acquired later for $44 cash per share in a subsequent merger,
giving the deal an aggregate value of $68 per share or a total of
$6.18 billion.
   On Tuesday, Federated announced its fourth-quarter earnings.
   The company said its net income rose nearly 10 percent to
$176.97 million, or $2 per share, up from $1.71.3 million, or $1.82
per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Sales for the quarter, which ended Jan. 31, totaled $3.55
billion, up from $3.44 billion.
   For all of fiscal 1987, Federated said it earned $313 million,
or $3.40 per share, up 14 percent from $287.6 million, or $2.97 per
share, in 1986.
   Sales for the year rose to $11.12 billion frtom $10.51 billion.

   Late mortgage payments and mortgage
foreclosures increased in the last quarter of 1987, with delinquent
payments rising for the first time in two years, according to the
Mortgage Bankers Association.
   The lenders trade group reported Tuesday that the number of
homeowners who were at least 30 days late in making a mortgage
payment edged up to 4.99 percent of the 10 million mortgages
surveyed in the fourth quarter.
   This compared to 4.63 percent in the July-September quarter,
which had been the lowest level in more than eight years.
   Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the association,
called the increase ``disappointing but not disheartening,'' noting
that the increase reflected continued weakness in depressed areas
of the country such as the oil-producing states of the Southwest.
   Foreclosures also rose to 0.27 percent of mortgages, up from
0.25 percent in the third quarter, with much of the increase coming
in the Midwest and the South.
   The increase in late mortgage payments was the first rise since
the fourth quarter of 1985, when the delinquency rate climbed to
5.75 percent.
   Even with the increase late last year, all regions of the
country reported lower deliquency rates when compared to a year
earlier.
   The West had the fewest delinquent mortgages in the final three
months of last year at 4.6 percent, followed by the Northeast at
4.76 percent and the North Central states at 5.96 percent. The
South had the highest delinquency rate in the fourth quarter with
6.07 percent of mortgage-holders at least 30 days late with a
payment.

<HEAD>Domestic Car and Truck Sales Up 6.3 Percent in Early March From
1987</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Car and truck shoppers who expected General
Motors Corp.'s buyer incentives to expire at the end of February
hastened their GM purchases, weakening the industry-leader's sales
in early March, industry analysts say.
   But early March brought generous surges in domestic car and
light truck sales for GM's top rivals, as Ford Motor Co. joined the
incentives battle that Chrysler Corp. has waged all year.
   Automakers reported Tuesday that total sales of domestic-built
cars and light trucks rose 6.3 percent in early March from a year
ago. Sales reached 328,437 in the nine selling days from March
1-10, compared with the 274,626 sold in the eight selling days of
the same period last year.
   The percentage change in sales measures the difference in
average daily sales during the two periods, not the difference in
total numbers of vehicles sold.
   Sales have improved in each of the seven sales periods of 1988
over early 1987, when showrooms were empty because of the late 1986
buying rush to beat impending tax law changes.
   In early March, automakers sold 211,772 domestic cars, up 3.5
percent from 181,820, and 116,665 light trucks, up 11.7 percent
from 92,806 a year ago.
   Despite last-minute extensions of its buyer incentives, GM's
domestic car sales fell 13 percent from a year ago and its light
truck sales slowed 1.5 percent from early March 1987.
   GM's domestic car sales fell to 95,372 from 97,487 a year ago.
GM's light truck sales fell slightly to 42,489, or 4,721 a day,
from 38,327, or 4,790 a day.
   ``A lot of people rushed to buy (GM) cars in early February, so
we had a kind of pay-back effect in early March,'' said David
Healy, analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   GM dealers also had pushed sales particularly hard in late
February, fearing a buildup of unsold car inventories that would be
hard to move in March without incentives, said Joseph Phillippi,
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York.
   GM's share of the domestic car market slipped in early March to
45 percent from 53.6 percent a year earlier. GM's truck market
share fell to 36.4 percent from 41.3 percent.
   Meanwhile, Ford boosted its early March sales by sweetening its
incentive program, the analysts said. Ford said its combined
domestic car and light truck sales were its highest for early March
since 1979.
   Ford's domestic car sales jumped 21.4 percent to 68,859 in early
March from 50,407 a year ago and its market share rose to 32.5
percent from 27.7 percent.
   Its light truck sales rose 18.1 percent to 46,073 in early March
from 34,685 a year ago as its market slice improved to 39.5 percent
from 37.4 percent.
   Chrysler's domestic-built car sales rose 18.3 percent to 34,667
from 26,046 a year ago. Its light truck sales jumped 24.1 percent,
to 25,287 from 18,108 a year ago.
   The No. 3 automaker's share of the domestic car market rose to
16.4 percent from 14.3 percent a year ago and its truck share
increased to 21.7 percent from 19.5 percent.
   Among the remaining domestic builders, Honda Motor Co. reported
a 71.9 percent jump in sales of cars built at its Marysville, Ohio,
factory. Toyota Motor Corp.'s domestic car sales rose 97.3 percent.
   Nissan Motor Corp.'s domestic car sales fell 19.7 percent from a
year ago but its domestic truck sales rose 48.5 percent. Volkswagen
of America's domestic car sales dropped 18.6 percent.

   Here are the sales results for the eight major
U.S. automakers for March 1-10 and the year to date, as compared
with the same period a year ago.
   The percentage changes are based on average daily sales _ not
total numbers of vehicles sold _ to take into account differences
in the number of selling days in each period.
   There were nine selling days in the first 10 days of March this
year and eight last year. There were 59 selling days in 1988 as of
March 10 and 58 days in 1987.
   Cars and trucks imported for sales under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Volkswagen, Honda,
Nissan, Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic and appear in this
table.

<HEAD>First City Grants Second Extension To Debt Holders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First City Bancorporation of Texas Inc. again has
extended its deadline to dissident debt holders who have been asked
to redeem their securities at a discount under a federal bailout
plan for the institution.
   Only about 51 percent of the holders of First City notes
totaling $225.9 million had tendered their securities as of lare
Tuesday afternoon.
   Texas' fourth-largest bank holding company had sought 90 percent
of those securities, which were to be redeemed at less than face
value as part of a buyout plan contained in a $1.5 billion bailout
led by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   If completed, it would be the second-biggest U.S. bank rescue
ever.
   The low response prompted First City to extend Tuesday's 5 p.m.
EST deadline to March 29. It was the second extension given by the
Houston-based company _ the first being last week after only 41.4
percent, or $93.6 million, of the notes had been redeemed for cash.
   Chicago investor A. Robert Abboud, who would become chairman of
First City under the bailout plan, said actions were being taken to
complete the transaction by alternate means but did not elaborate.
   Under a buyout plan that was made a condition of the federal
bailout, holders of First City's debt securities wre offered from
35 cents to 45 cents on the dollar for their notes.
   Abboud, who said debt holders would fare worse if the bank were
liquidated, told federal regulators in Washington last weekend that
not enough of the note holders had agreed to sell at those prices.
He also has contended there was no intention to raise the amount of
the offer.
   However, some industry analysts have indicated that some debt
holders who don't tender their notes might end up getting a better
deal once First City is recapitalized. Depending on the strength of
the recapitalized institution, the bonds could trade at
significantly higher prices than Abboud is offering.
   Still other analysts have said the FDIC could refuse to raise
the offer for fear of setting a precedent for future bank bailouts.
   Some of the alternatives being discussed for First City included
dropping the participation threshold below 90 percent or
terminating the tender offer.
   Other options available to the FDIC, analysts said, include
canceling the Abboud deal and reopening bidding for the bank, or
having the FDIC itself take over First City. The FDIC did just that
in 1984, pumping $4.5 billion into Continental Illinois Bank and
Trust of Chicago during the largest U.S. bank bailout ever.
   Another plan calls for First City's 59 banks in Texas and one in
South Dakota to fail and merge into a ``bridge bank'' until a new
buyer is found. Still another option is for the holding company,
with $11 billion in assets, to enter voluntary bankruptcy
proceedings.
   First City grew quickly during the Texas oil boom, but was
hammered by energy and real estate losses when oil prices
plummeted. For 1987, the company posted a $1.1 billion loss.
   The bailout plan calls for $970 million in federal assistance, a
$500 million infusion of capital raised privately by an investor
group headed by Abboud and a spinoff of $1.79 billion in book value
of poorly performing assets.
   On March 4, more than 71 percent of the bank holding company's
37 million shareholders approved the controversial bailout.

<HEAD>Airbus Subsidy Battle Heating Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, angry over European
subsidies for the Airbus aircraft-manufacturing consortium, is
increasing pressure on Airbus nations to abolish or at least reduce
the payments, say diplomatic sources.
   ``The Americans at a minimum want the Europeans to give a signal
that they are willing to accept some effective discipline in regard
to subsidies,'' an informed diplomatic source, who asked not to be
identified further, said Tuesday.
   The United States estimates that the four countries involved in
Airbus Industrie _ France, Britain, West Germany and Spain _ have
pumped $10 billion into the consortium since it was created 17
years ago.
   Ministers of the four Airbus countries are to meet with U.S.
trade officials in the southern West German resort city of
Constance on Friday to continue discussions on the dispute.
   Willy de Clercq, the European Economic Community's external
relations commissioner, said last week that there was a ``realistic
chance'' of settling the dispute, but said EEC governments could
not entirely renounce state aid payments to Airbus.
   He predicted an agreement would require ``further rounds of very
difficult negotiations.''
   The United States maintains that subsidies to Airbus are unfair
to U.S. aircraft makers in the wide-body, long-haul passenger jet
market.
   The Airbus nations contend the subsidies do not distort trade
and are allowed under the civil aircraft provisions of the General
Agreements on Tariffs and Trade.
   The EEC also contends U.S. aircraft manufacturers long have
enjoyed huge, indirect subsidies through military contracts from
the Pentagon and millions in government research grants.
   The United States has threatened to retaliate against Airbus if
the negotiations fail, despite a recent decision by the four Airbus
ministers to have Airbus managers enter into direct negotiations
with McDonnell Douglas Corp. on a possible joint project.
   The aim of the talks is to see whether the two sides could
collaborate on one or more new airplanes. Under the prosposal, the
new aircraft would not compete with existing models.
   But diplomatic sources told The Associated Press that the move
was unlikely to reduce tensions over the subsidy issue.
   ``It may well be helpful for Airbus and McDonnell Douglas to
agree on a joint project, but that will not solve the core problem
of the current subsidies,'' said another diplomatic source, who
also declined to be identified further.
   A spokesman for U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter in
Washington declined comment on the upcoming meeting. Yeutter is
expected to attend the talks.

Week</HEAD>

   The announcement Tuesday that weekend office hours
will end next year for the nation's Postal Savings System could
mean an effective move to a five-day work week.
   Japan's Posts and Telecommunications Minister, a top banking
official and the president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange all
indicated separately on Tuesday that they favored moving toward a
nationwide five-day work week beginning February 1989.
   Such moves by the concerned parties would eliminate Saturday
business hours for the Postal Savings System, banks and stock
trading.
   Japan's banks and stock market currently only close on the
second and third Saturdays of each month, while keeping half-day
hours for the remaining Saturdays. A six-day work week still is
routine for many Japanese.
   The proposal is designed to promote a less workaholic and a more
leisure-based society commensurate with Japan's higher standard of
living. Such a trend, proponents argue, could indirectly stimulate
domestic demand by increasing personal consumption and the growth
of service and other non-export industries.
   The movement toward a five-day work week has drawn increased
support from financial and government groups for the past several
years.
   Posts and Telecommunications Minister Masaaki Nakayama touched
off a flurry of comments Tuesday by announcing he had decided to
terminate weekend office hours for the Postal Savings System
beginning next February.
   The ministry oversees the system _ one of the largest savings
networks in the world _ where cash deposits have been declining due
to higher interest rates on other investment instruments.
   In response to Nakayama's decision, Kenichi Kamiya, chairman of
the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan said, ``It is
important for all large participants to be in agreement.''
   A federation spokesman said Kamiya's comments, made at a
separate press conference, meant to suggest major banks and
securities houses would be willing to fall in line with the savings
ministry's move.
   In another separate comment, Tokyo Stock Exchange president
Michio Takeuchi said he favored the five-day work week in the wake
of Nakayama's decision.
   Kamiya, who also is president of Mitsui Bank Ltd., added the
banking federation, which represents the interests of major
Japanese banking institutions, has been working on the concept of
creating a five-day work week since November of last year.
   Japan's banking industry had hoped to shift toward the five-day
week as early as October 1988, but postponed its action until early
1989 in order to overlap with the anticipated weekend closing of
government postal savings offices, industry sources said.

<HEAD>E.W. Scripps To Sell Some Stock to Public</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   E.W. Scripps Co., the privately held parent
corporation of the Scripps Howard Media Group, says it plans to
sell some of its limited-voting common stock to the public.
   The newspaper publishing company said Tuesday that the number of
shares to be sold had not been determined but that control of the
company would remain with the founding Scripps family.
   It said the required paperwork was expected to be filed with the
federal Securities and Exchange Commission next month.
   Lawrence A. Leser, president and chief executive officer, said
the stock sale was intended to pay off debt incurred for the
company's acquisition program begun in 1986 and to finance further
growth.
   Leser said it also would provide liquidity for members of the
Scripps family who will control the company after the termination
of the Edward W. Scripps Trust, the present controlling shareholder.
   The trust is to terminate upon the death of the last of the four
eldest children of Robert P. Scripps, son of company founder E.W.
Scripps. At termination, the assets of the trust are to be
distributed to 28 great-grandchildren of E.W. Scripps.
   During its existence, the trust is required to maintain voting
control of E.W. Scripps Co.
   The company has an 80 percent-owned subsidiary, Scripps Howard
Broadcasting Co., which has public ownership and is traded
over-the-counter. The stock sale will not affect the status of that
company, the announcement said.
   E.W. Scripps Co. owns 21 daily newspapers, nine television
stations, five radio stations and cable systems nationwide that
serve approximately 400,000 cable TV subscribers. It also owns
United Media, a New York-based syndicator of newspaper columns and
comic strips.
   E.W. Scripps Co. was reincorporated in Delaware in 1987 and has
two classes of common stock outstanding: regular common and Class A
common, which has limited voting power. The capital structure is
similar to that of other media companies that seek to retain
control within the founding family, Leser said.
   The Edward W. Scripps Trust now owns 73 percent of the regular
common shares and 90 percent of the Class A shares.
   Holders of the Class A common shares to be sold to the public
will be entitled to elect a third of the company directors, but
will not have other voting rights.
   In all other respects, the Class A stock is comparable to the
regular common shares, the company said.
   Charles E. Scripps, board chairman of the E.W. Scripps Co. and
chairman of the trustees of the trust, said: ``My grandfather,
through the trust, perpetuated family control for as long as was
legally possible. The present capitalization, with a public market
for the Class A common shares, will permit the next generation of
the family to retain control of the company after the termination
of the trust and provide liquidity for their holdings.''
   The majority of the shares to be offered will be newly issued
stock. The trust will sell a portion of its holding, but it will
continue to hold a majority of both the regular common and Class A
shares after the sale.

<HEAD>Giant Texas Bank Holding Company Seeking Federal Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT ROTHSCHILD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First RepublicBank Corp.'s attempt to seek federal
assistance comes as the nation's 13th-largest banking company tries
to bolster the waning confidence of its depositors and the
financial markets.
   First RepublicBank indicated Tuesday it was seeking federal aid
to keep from failing, and had held preliminary discussions with the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   ``We seek some assistance, yet to be defined. We will be putting
together, over the next few weeks, a plan that we can submit to the
FDIC for assistance,'' said Gerald W. Fronterhouse, chairman and
chief executive officer.
   ``It was important that we initiate those discussions in order
to provide a more stable environment for our company,'' he said.
   Shaken by the slumping real estate and energy sectors and a loss
of confidence in the institution by Wall Street, First RepublicBank
suffered a loss of about $600 million in deposits over a five-day
period last month, prompting the decision to seek federal help.
   ``Certainly two or three weeks ago we didn't believe this would
be necessary,'' said Joseph C. Bowles, a spokesman for the company.
   First RepublicBank officials tried last month to combat rumors
that the bank was considering merging with another financial
institution, taking the unusual step of buying full-page newspaper
ads to assure customers their deposits were safe.
   Bowles said he didn't believe the latest development would lead
more depositors to withdraw their money because ``we expect our
customers will understand that their money is protected.''
   First RepublicBank is discussing whether to pursue open-bank
assistance from the FDIC, generally used only if the agency finds
keeping a bank open would be less costly to the government than
letting it fail.
   An FDIC bailout of that kind would require regulators to
determine that the bank would fail without help.
   Disclosure of the talks with the government _ and the company's
suspension of payment of preferred stock dividends _ were greeted
with pessimism by Wall Street.
   First RepublicBank's stock fell 25 cents to $1.50 a share
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange _ a 14.3 percent drop.
   Furthermore, Standard & Poor's Corp. downgraded First
RepublicBank's senior debt rating to its lowest level short of
default. The Wall Street credit rating form also downgraded the
bank holding company's certificate of deposit and commercial paper
ratings.
   Fronterhouse contended the company would continue to thrive and
remain an important institution in the state for years.
   But financial analysts said the request for federal aid could
foretell a buyout or merger for First RepublicBank, which was
created by the merger of Dallas rivals InterFirst Corp. and
RepublicBank Corp. in 1987.
   ``The real estate market turned down, I think, much more rapidly
than the bank had thought and it just turned into a snowball
effect,'' said Frank Anderson, a Dallas independent bank
consultant. ``And they got into a situation where news was being
leaked from meetings of some of their top-level officials to
various news media.
   ``And whereas that did not cause the problem, it surely
exacerbated the problem,'' said Anderson.
   First RepublicBank lost $656 million in 1987, mainly because a
staggering 17 percent of its $15 billion loan portfolio was either
past due or renegotiated.
   Reports indicate the holding company stands to lose another $450
million this year. The company has 73 affiliate banks in Texas and
assets of $33.2 billion, and employs 15,188 people.
   Separately, Houston-based First City Bancorporation of Texas
Inc. extended a Tuesday deadline for debt holders to redeem their
securities at a discount under a rescue plan representing the
second-largest bank bailout in U.S. history.
   First City granted a second extension, to 5 p.m. EST March 29,
after the required 90 percent of debt holders failed to tender
their the securities.
   Some industry analysts contended that First RepublicBank's
decision to seek federal aid could help Texas banking.
   ``It should lend further stability to the banking system in the
state,'' said Sandy Flannigan, an analyst and vice president of
PaineWebber Inc. ``There has been a great deal of negative press,
and the fact that they are seeking some kind of FDIC assistance
should create some additional confidence in the system.''

<HEAD>Manufacturers Hanover President In Suprise Resignation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John R. Torrell III's surprise resignation as
president of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. comes as the bank holding
company is on the verge of an expected rebound from recent
financial setbacks.
   Torell resigned ``at his initiative'' to pursue other business
opportunities, according to spokesman John Stefans. The resignation
is effective at the end of this month.
   ``The board accepted it with deepest regret,'' Stefans said.
   Recent speculation on Wall Street about a possible management
shakeup at the bank had focused not on Torell but on John F.
McGillicuddy, Manufacturers Hanover's chairman and chief executive,
according to analysts.
   In his most recent position, Torell was the company's No. 2
executive behind McGillicuddy and widely was considered his heir
apparent.
   Analysts have said Torell played a key role in helping the
banking company emerge from its recent earnings problems and was
largely responsible for developing its successful consumer finance
business.
   In its annual report released earlier this month, Manufacturers
Hanover said it expected a profit of at least $807 million this
year. Like other big money-center banks, Manufacturers Hanover
established a huge loan-loss reserve to cover shaky foreign debts
in 1987, which was largely responsible for a $1.14 billion loss
that year.
   Torell, 48, said in a news release from the bank that after a
27-year career at Manufacturers Hanover, including 10 years as a
director, ``it is time for a change.''
   Torell joined the bank fresh from graduation from Princeton
University. He became vice chairman in 1978, president of the bank
in 1982 and president of the holding company in 1985, Stefans said.
   Manufacturers Hanover is the nation's sixth largest bank holding
company with assets totaling $73.3 billion.
   A search committee of the board will be convened to choose a
successor for Torell. Candidates from inside and outside the
institution will be considered, according to McGillicuddy.

<HEAD>Citibank Accused of Denying Credit to Humanities Majors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH CARTIERE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citibank says it is retreating from a
policy that denied credit cards to some university students because
they majored in humanities, after receiving complaints from around
the country.
   In the latest fallout from the policy, students at the
University of California who said they were denied cards because of
their humanities majors called for the bank to change the policy or
get its representatives off campus.
   ``It doesn't take people from college to see that their
reasoning that a humanities major is more of a financial risk than
an engineering major is pretty weak,'' said student Kennedy Yip, 22.
   Yip _ a rhetoric major _ received a Visa last year while
attending a different college as a mathematics major. Yip's
rejection letter for a Citibank MasterCard dated Feb. 13 listed
``field of study'' as the cause.
   Other liberal arts majors who say Citibank rejected their credit
applications include some studying Italian and history.
   Bill McGuire, a Citibank spokesman in New York, said the bank
was ``moving away'' from the policy, which would be discontinued by
the end of June. He admitted the company had received complaints
from students at other universities around the country but he would
not identify the schools.
   McGuire, in an interview Tuesday with the Oakland Tribune, would
not describe how the policy was applied.
   Some students with humanities majors at Berkeley reported they
had received Citibank credit cards.
   Furthermore, a spokesman for the U.S. Comptroller of the
Currency in Kansas City, Mo. said Tuesday that the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act does not prohibit using a student's academic major
in a credit application system.
   Nevertheless, some of the students turned down for credit at
Berkeley are seeking to have Citibank denied access to the campus,
where its representatives set up tables around the student union to
accept credit applications.
   The humanities policy surfaced last week when Irene Chang, a
reporter for the independent campus newspaper, The Daily
Californian, asked a campus bank-card canvasser how to apply.
   ``I told her I had heard a rumor that English majors were being
turned down, and she said I should give her a student photo
identification instead of my registration card, which lists my
major,'' Chang said Tuesday in an interview.
   ``She then told me to fill in the application by putting in
business administration or electrical engineering as my major,
instead of English, which she said was what students (at another
university) were doing,'' Chang said.
   Matt Denn, Berkeley student body president, said he doesn't want
to threaten Citibank but believes student government's right to
regulate groups at the student union building gives him ``leverage
to suggest a policy change.''
   Molly Sorkin, 22, an art history major rejected last fall for a
Visa from Citibank because of her major, says she supports punitive
action against Citibank.
   ``It's obvious discrimination, and I don't think they should be
allowed to get away with thinking that some majors are the ones
that are going to be making all the money,'' she said.
   ``What I study says nothing about my responsibility or whether
or not I can pay my bills,'' said Sorkin, who graduated in December
and now works in retail sales.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aggregate overseas equity investment
by South Korean companies since 1962 totaled $1 billion as of the
end of February, the Finance Ministry reported Wednesday.
   Ministry officials said it was the first time the cumulative
tally topped the $1 billion mark since 1962 Korean companies began
investing abroad in 1962.
   They said about one-third of the total went to the United States
for manufacturing and other projects.
   Officials also said Korean investment abroad had shown marked
rises in the past two years, reflecting the country's growing
current account surplus, with $157 million invested in 1986 and
$397 million in 1987.
   Ministry statistics indicated foreign equity investment in South
Korea since 1962 was a cumulative $3.92 billion as of the end of
January, after deducting withdrawals over the period.

<TEXT>
   The dollar gained ground against all major foreign
currencies except the Canadian dollar in thin European trading
early today despite some profit-taking.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign currency dealers said market attention was focused on
Thursday's scheduled release of U.S. trade figures for January.
Analysts are divided on whether the figures will show an expanding
or shrinking trade deficit.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.24 yen to 127.49. Later, in London, it was quoted
at 127.40 yen.
   ``The yen is easing against the dollar ... but everyone is
waiting for the latest U.S. trade data,'' said an exchange dealer
at a major commercial bank in Tokyo.
   A trader with a major Italian commercial bank in Milan, Italy,
said his bank was predicting a January shortfall of $13.5 billion,
wider than $12.2 billion in December. But he said ``it shouldn't
hurt the dollar too much.''
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.6683 West German marks, up from 1.6650; 1.3802
Swiss francs, up from 1.3760; 5.6770 French francs, up from 5.6605;
1.8734 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8705; 1,237.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,232.40; and 1.2540 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2564.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8505, cheaper for buyers
than late Tuesday's $1.8570.
   Gold was firming in London at midmorning amid reports of Swiss
buying.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $445 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $443.50. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $447.15.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $442, down from $442.50 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.52 to close at a bid $447.79.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.36 a troy
ounce, up from Tuesday's $6.25.

   Tokyo's leading stock index surged today to its
highest level since last October's crash, while the U.S. dollar
rose slightly as traders awaited the release of U.S. trade deficit
figures for January.
   The dollar closed at 127.49 yen, up 0.24 yen from Tuesday's
close. It opened at 127.38, and ranged between 127.32 yen and
127.55 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which climbed 42.16 points Tuesday, closed today
at 25,704.43 points, up 228.76 points, or 0.90 percent.
   Today's closing was the highest since stock prices plunged in
October. The previous post-crash high was 25,682.82 points, on
March 2.
   Volume in the first section was estimated at 1.6 billion shares,
roughly the same as Tuesday, but 1.1 billion shares changed hands
during the morning session alone in what traders were calling
exceptionally heavy trading.
   Heavy industrials, steel and electronics were leading the surge,
said one broker.
   Investors were spurred by U.S. payments data for the final
quarter of 1987 showing the invisible trade balance in the black,
one analyst said.
   In the foreign exchange market, traders continued their attitude
of wait and see.
   ``The yen is easing against the dollar ... but everyone is
waiting for the latest U.S. trade data,'' said an exchange dealer
at a major commercial bank in Tokyo.
   The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled to release the
nation's foreign trade figures for January on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan was poised today to veto a
major piece of civil rights legislation and call for an alternative
giving corporations and religious schools more exemptions from
anti-discrimination laws.
   A top civil rights leader said the veto would leave ``a terrible
and lasting stain on the Reagan presidency'' and Democratic leaders
predicted that Congress would quickly override the president's
action.
   Today was the deadline for action on the sweeping measure,
designed to overcome the effects of a 1984 Supreme Court decision
that has allowed institutions to receive federal aid even when some
of their departments discriminate illegally.
   The bill would require all parts of any institution receiving
federal aid to obey anti-discrimination laws.
   ``We have said all along we would veto,'' White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   Fitzwater said the president believes the Supreme Court's
decision, which involved Grove City College in Pennsylvania, was a
mistake but that the corrective legislation goes too far in seeking
to correct the problem.
   The bill became an issue in Tuesday's Illinois presidential
primary when Vice President George Bush refused to say whether he
would veto or sign the legislation if he were president.
   Fitzwater said the administration has ``a very positive
alternative bill'' but he declined to give details.
   An administration official, however, speaking on condition he
not be identified, said the alternative was expected to be ``very
much like'' a GOP substitute that the House rejected by a 266-146
vote on March 2.
   That measure would have scaled back the bill's impact on
corporations and allowed more schools to avoid compliance with
civil rights laws on religious grounds.
   Reagan wrote to House Republicans that he objected to the bill
that eventually passed because it ``dramatically expands the scope
of federal jurisdiction over state and local governments and the
private sector'' and ``poses a particular threat to religious
liberty.''
   The Senate passed the bill 75-14 and the House passed it 315-98,
margins substantially greater than the two-thirds majority of both
houses needed to override a presidential veto.
   House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Tuesday
that he expected the Senate to override Reagan's veto later this
week and the House to follow suit next week.
   Ralph Neas, executive director of the 200-group Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, said that by vetoing the bill Reagan
would be ``favoring federal subsidies to discrimination.''
   ``A presidential veto of a bill to end federal funding of
discrimination would be unconscionable,'' he said. ``It will leave
a terrible and lasting stain on the Reagan presidency.''
   The administration official who spoke anonymously said the White
House strategy would be to try to get House members who voted for
the GOP substitute to vote to sustain the veto. Since 146 _ the
number of legislators who supported the House GOP substitute _ is
slightly more than one-third of the full House membership of 435,
that could be enough to sustain.
   The civil rights bill would require entire colleges, school
systems, government agencies and private entities to comply with
anti-discrimination laws if any program or activity within them
receives federal money. Institutions that did not comply would lose
their federal funding.
   The Supreme Court's Grove City decision limited the penalty to
the specific program or activity that violated the law.

   Stock prices fell Wednesday amid concerns about
British monetary policy following Tuesday's fiscal 1989 budget
announcement.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 stocks was down
9 points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,830.9 at midday.
   Volume was a moderate 314.1 million shares, compared with 241.3
million shares the same time Tuesday.
   Concerns focused on the strength of the pound and perceptions
that the next move in British interest rates likely would be higher.
   The pound's recent rise has spurred worries about lower
corporate profitability. The budget announcement did little to
dispel these fears, dealers said.
   Also hitting share prices was profit-taking following strong
gains posted in the run-up to the budget announcement, dealers said.
   They added that prices were being marked down amid light volume
as the market awaits Thursday's release of U.S. trade figures for
January.
   ``With U.S. trade figures tomorrow, I don't think I'd be an
aggressive buyer either,'' said Nicholas Knight, an equities
strategist at James Capel and Co.

<HEAD>Chrysler Ups Rebates on 6 Models, Plans Cut After Weekend on 3
Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has boosted buyer incentives on
six models, offering as much as $1,500 in rebates, and one analyst
said a ``fire sale'' seemed to be under way at the No. 3 U.S.
automaker.
   Chrysler said Tuesday it was raising rebates on five 1987 and
1988 Dodge cars and trucks and one Jeep model. The incentive
program has no expiration date.
   The automaker also said it planned to reduce rebates on three
other models after the weekend.
   Analysts credit the aggressive use of incentives with spurring
sales. In early March, Chrysler's domestic car sales were up 18.3
percent and its light truck sales were up 24.1 percent from a year
ago.
   ``Chrysler has the most generous incentives of any automaker.
It's really running a fire sale on its left-over '87s,'' said
Ronald Glantz, analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc. in San
Francisco.
   Rebates rose to $1,500 from $750 on the Daytona Pacifica; to
$1,000 from $750 on Daytona Shelby Z and standard Ram pickups; to
$1,000 from $500 on standard Ram B150, B250 and B350 passenger
vans; and to $750 from $500 on Dakota mid-size pickups and Jeep
Comanche pickup.
   Chrysler said it also added its 1987 and 1988 Chrysler LeBaron
convertible to the program with a $750 rebate.
   On Monday, rebates on three other models will be reduced. The
rebate on the 1987 and 1988 LeBaron coupe will drop to $750 from
$1,500; to $1,000 from $1,500 on the Dodge Ramcharger sport-utility
vehicle; and to $500 from $750 on the Dodge Daytona Highline.
   Instead of rebates, buyers can opt for low-rate financing with
interest rates of 3.8 percent on loans up to 48 months and 8.8
percent on loans up to 60 months, Chrysler said.
   Meanwhile, General Motors Corp.'s GMC Truck division said it was
extending its $500 rebate campaign through the end of the month on
1987 and 1988 S-15 compact pickups and sport-utility vehicles.
   GM also added its new 1988 Sierra full-size pickup and 1987 and
1988 Rally passenger vans and Vandura cargo vans to the program,
also with $500 rebates.
   The rebates may be used in addition to continuous option
discounts.
   Analysts said GM sales fell in early March because buyers took
advantage of widespread incentives in February.

   The publisher of a Canadian computer magazine
says he was trying to show the dangers of software piracy when he
wrote a rogue computer program that has popped up in software
developed by Seattle's Aldus Corp.
   But to Aldus and others, the so-called computer ``virus'' _
apparently the first to appear in commercial software _ has caused
consternation.
   Viruses are programs created by computer operators for secret
insertion into other programs as jokes or as acts of vandalism.
They can spread from computer to computer when operators share
contaminated software.
   Consequences of the ``disease'' can range from a surprise
message that pops up on a computer screen, as happened with the
Aldus virus, to the destruction of information stored in computer
memories.
   Until now, personal computer viruses were thought to reside only
in non-commercial software, such as that available free or at low
cost on computerized bulletin boards or on software disks shared by
computer users.
   Experts had thought viruses could be avoided if users used only
commercial, off-the-shelf programs.
   Richard Brandow, publisher of Montreal-based MacMag,
acknowledged Tuesday in an interview that he wrote the so-called
``peace message'' that popped up on thousands of Apple Macintosh
computer screens.
   Brandow claimed that besides calling for world peace, the virus
was intended to discourage software piracy or unauthorized copying
and to encourage computer users to buy original copies.
   The virus was discovered in FreeHand, a new program developed by
Aldus for Macintosh computers, said Aldus spokeswoman Laury Bryant
said. The message flashed when the program was loaded in the
computer, Ms. Bryant said.
   Although it ``was a very benign incident,'' Aldus officials are
angry and ``are talking with our attorneys to understand what our
legal rights are in this instance,'' Ms. Bryant said.
   ``We feel that Richard Brandow's actions deserve to be condemned
by every member of the Macintosh community,'' she said.
   The incident resulted in Aldus having to recall or rework
thousands of packages of the new software. Ms. Bryant declined to
say how much the recall or reworking of software would cost.
   The incident also sent a scare through the computer industry,
because several of the nation's largest software companies also are
clients of a MacroMind Inc. of Chicago, a subcontractor that
inadvertently spread the virus to Aldus.
   MacroMind President Marc Canter said in a telephone interview
Tuesday that he believed Aldus was the only customer that received
the virus.
   Among Canter's clients are the nation's three largest software
producers _ Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Ashton-Tate, and Lotus
Development Corp. _ and Apple.
   Ashton-Tate declined comment, but officials at Microsoft, Apple
and Lotus all said none of their software was infected.
   Canter said the virus apparently was in a packet of software he
obtained from Brandow. Unaware of the infection, Canter ran the
progam once and when he used the same computer to work on Aldus
software, the disk eventually sent to Aldus became infected, he
said.
   The computer virus then inadvertently was copied onto disks sold
to customers and infected their computers, he said.
   Brandow said he met Canter, but denied giving him software.
   Brandow said the virus program was written and tested for a year
on a number of Macintosh computers, and was left for two days in
December on a Macintosh at the magazine's offices.
   The publisher said he had expected that people making
unauthorized copies of programs on the machine would spread the
virus in the Montreal area and possibly a few other areas of Canada
and the United States.
   Instead, Brandow said, an estimated 350,000 people in North
America and Europe had the message pop up on their computers on
March 2.
   Brandow said neither he nor his employees put the message on a
computer billboard or information network, but he did not rule out
the possibility that others who copied it without permission placed
programs containing the message on such services.
   Ms. Bryant and Brandow both said the virus died out after March
2.
   The full message, according to Brandow, read: ``Richard Brandow,
the publisher of MacMag, and its entire staff would like to take
this opportunity to convey their universal message of peace to all
Macintosh users around the world.'' Beneath that was a graphic of
the globe.

<HEAD>Northwest Eases Advance Purchase Requirement on Some Discount
Fares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines has lowered the advance
purchase requirement, to three days, on a discount fare used by
business travelers.
   The change took effect Tuesday as major airlines, including
Northwest, raised full coach fares and ended some discount fares,
sharply increasing the cost of travel for people who cannot make
plans in advance.
   Northwest's change, which its competitors are expected to match,
will make it easier for travelers to take advantage of some
discount fares. The fare, available on a limited number of seats on
most routes, carries no cancellation penalty and has no other
restrictions.
   Under the changes that took effect Tuesday, most discount fares
generally require a seven-day advance purchase and carry a
cancellation penalty of 25 percent.
   If other airlines match the Northwest fare, it would be the
first modification of a series of fare increases proposed this
month by Continental Airlines and matched by all leading carriers.
   William Wren, vice president for public relations at Northwest,
said the airline was joining its competitors in extending to seven
days from two the advance purchase requirement on Maxsaver fares,
the lowest fares available.
   In addition, Wren said some carriers were proposing a 14-day
advance purchase requirement, but that Northwest did not support
the idea.

   The stock market showed a small gain today,
continuing the sluggish pattern of the past two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .83 to 2,048.24 in
the first half hour.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 468 up, 446 down and 578
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.47 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market has been in a holding pattern since the start of the
week as traders await Thursday's report on the nation's trade
balance for January.
   Most economists look for a modest increase in the trade deficit
after two months of pronounced declines. If the figures match those
expectations, analysts believe the market wouldn't feel any great
shock effects.
   But traders apparently are sticking with a cautious approach
until then so as not to be caught off guard by any surprise either
way.
   After the trade report, the market is also faced with a
quarterly ``triple witching hour'' involving a series of stock
index options and futures that will be settled Friday.
   That too may pass quietly, brokers say, but until it is over it
adds an additional element of uncertainty for investors.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Union Carbide rose | to 25 and

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged

   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2.66 to

<HEAD>Housing Construction Up Sharply, Industrial Production Inches
Higher</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 5 grafs to UPDATE with figures on industrial
production, tighten. Picks up 5th graf pvs, On Tuesday ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction posted the biggest increase in more than a
year as new projects climbed by 8.9 percent in February, while
industrial production edged up 0.2 percent, the government reported
today.
   The Commerce Department said last month's gain in housing
construction raised activity to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 1.49 million units. The increase followed declines of 1.9
percent in January and 15.8 percent in December.
   The unexpectedly strong February report was likely to ease
worries about a possible recession. The 8.9 percent rise in housing
starts in February was the sharpest monthly gain since a 12.7
percent rise in December 1986.
   The increase in February industrial production represented the
fifth consecutive monthly gain, according to the Federal Reserve.
The Fed said the advance followed a 0.3 percent increase in January
and left American industry operating at a rate 5.8 percent above a
year ago.
   Analysts said the report was consistent with their view that the
economy will continue to move forward this year, but at a slower
pace than in 1987.
   On Tuesday, a jump in early March auto sales and news of a
record 1987 trade deficit failed to wield much influence in the
financial markets.
   Major automakers said Tuesday that sales of domestic cars and
light trucks rose 6.3 percent in the first 10 days of March
compared with a year earlier, led by surging sales of vehicles made
by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. Industry leader General Motors
Corp. reported weaker results.
   In Washington, the Commerce Department said the deficit in the
broadest measure of foreign trade surged to a record $160.7 billion
in 1987, a reflection of America's deepening debt to the rest of
the world.
   The deficit in the U.S. current account was 13.7 percent higher
than the 1986 deficit of $141.4 billion and marked the fifth
consecutive year that this trade deficit has hit a new record.
   The Reagan administration has sought to downplay the
significance of the trade deficits, but private economists contend
the rapid buildup of foreign debt could cause a further weakening
in the dollar's value and a recession.
   The current account measures not only the flow of merchandise
across U.S. borders but also the flow of services, primarily
investment earnings.
   Net debtor status means Americans own less investments abroad
than foreigners do in this country.
   Despite the latest trade statistics, Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday that Americans shouldn't be
overly concerned and that foreign investors make ``good corporate
citizens.''
   ``We will find that foreign investment in the United States will
be a plus,'' even at present record levels, Greenspan told the
House-Senate Joint Economic Committee.
   Neither the auto sales or foreign trade figures had much impact
on Wall Street, where stocks were mixed in light trading. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials fell 2.66 points to 2,047.41.
   Prices in the bond market, a sensitive barometer of interest
rates and the economy, also ended little changed.

   Housing construction posted the biggest
increase in more than a year as new projects climbed by 8.9 percent
in February, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the increase last month pushed
construction activity to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.49
million units.
   The increase followed declines of 1.9 percent in January and
15.8 percent in December.
   Those back-to-back monthly declines, which left housing starts
at their slowest pace since the end of the last recession, had
raised fears of a possible new economic downturn in the wake of the
record collapse of the stock market in October.
   Pessimists noted that housing is often the first sector to turn
down at the onset of a new recession.
   However, the big jump in housing activity in February, which was
much stronger than expected, was likely to ease worries about a
possible recession this year, especially since other business
barometers including employment gains, have shown strength since
the Oct. 19 stock market collapse.
   In another report today, the government said that production at
U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percent in February
following a 0.3 percent January gain. It was the fifth consecutive
increase and left American industry producing at a 5.8 percent
higher level than a year ago.
   Economists said the increase in housing starts, while still
leaving them well below the level of a year ago, was a good sign
that the industry's two-month skid had been halted.
   ``The rebound in housing is yet another sign of an economy that
is growing slowly but is far from a recession,'' said John A.
Tuccillo, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors.
``The lower interest rates enjoyed by the mortgage market in late
January through February have revived what had seemed to be a dying
housing sector.''
   James Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, said he expected that mortgage rates, which are
currently at an average of 9.96 percent for 30-year, fixed-rate
mortgages, will not likely fall further but should stay around that
level for the next several months.
   The 8.9 percent rise in housing starts in February was the
sharpest monthly gain since a 12.7 percent rise in December 1986.
   Housing permits, considered a good sign of future economic
activity, also rose sharply in February, jumping 11.5 percent to an
annual rate of 1.40 million units, also the biggest monthly gain
since December 1986.
   Many economists had been predicting a rebound in housing, given
the fact that mortgage rates have fallen sharply since the first of
the year and are again in the single-digit range.
   The strength in starts last month came in the construction of
both single-family and multi-family housing.
   Construction of single-family homes rose 9.3 percent in February
to a seasonally adjusted 1.10 million units.
   Construction of multi-family units was up 7.8 percent to an
annual rate of 399,000 units.
   The strength was widespread in all sections of the country
except the West, where starts fell 9 percent.
   Housing starts rose 25.6 percent in the South, 13.8 percent in
the Midwest and 2.7 percent in the Northeast.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. announced today it has
agreed to buy a majority interest in Western Auto Supply Co. and
will make a tender offer for the remainder of Western Auto's
outstanding shares in a $402 million deal.
   Sears said in a statement it will pay $19 a share for 52.3
percent of Western Auto's stock held by certain stockholders,
including officers and directors.
   Sears said it will offer the same cash price for all remaining
stock if it can win the approval of Western Auto's board of
directors this week.
   Western Auto's stock, which is traded on the over-the-counter
market, was up $6 to $18.50 a share in early trading today.
   The stock buyout would cost Sears $250 million and the retailer
also would assume the auto supply company's $152 million debt.
   Western Auto is a Kansas City-based marketer of auto supplies,
tires, appliances and lawn and garden equipment. It has 6,600
employees and operates 278 company-owned retail stores. It also
sells at wholesale to 1,570 independently owned Western Auto stores
nationwide.
   The acquisition would represent Sears' further expansion into
specialty marketing. The nation's largest retailer previously
bought apparel store and optical center chains.
   Last year, Western Auto had a profit of $10.5 million on sales
of $930.8 million. Sears earned $1.65 billion and had revenues of
$48.44 billion.
   Sears said it reserved the right to cancel the deal if the
Western Auto board fails to give its approval by Friday.

<HEAD>Proposed Merger Hits Snag In Federal Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge sent attorneys working on
A.H. Robins Co.'s merger agreement with American Home Products
Corp. back to the drawing board today, but the hitch did not appear
to be major.
   ``My view right now is I will not approve it as it stands,''
U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. said at a brief hearing
on the proposed merger.
   Merhige, who is overseeing Robins' Chapter 11 bankruptcy case
with U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Blackwell N. Shelley, said he was
concerned about the status of Dalkon Shield claims during the
expected appeals of the case.
   Under the $700 million merger agreement, American Home Products
would not be obligated for claims from users of the intrauterine
device until the final order is entered after appeals.
   Merhige said he found that provision unacceptable.
   ``I'm not going to delay this any more. These women have waited
and waited and waited,'' the judge said.
   Merhige suggested that the case go forward by having American
Home Products put up $100 million of the proposed $2.475 billion
fund to resolve claims against the intrauterine birth control
device.
   If the merger is voided on appeal, Merhige said, then American
Home Products could recover the money from Robins.
   Merhige sent the attorneys to work on the problem.
   Robins' reorganization must include a settlement of about
195,000 claims from women who contend they were injured by the IUD,
which was sold by Robins in the early 1970s.
   Robins and American Home Products of New York reached a merger
agreement Jan. 21 after the Richmond-based pharmacuetical company
had negotiated similar agreements with two other potential buyers,
France's Sanofi SA and the Rorer Group Inc. of Pennsylvania.
   Robins has been under Chapter 11 protection from creditors since
August 1985 because of the Dalkon Shield claims.

   Most grain and soybean futures prices opened
slightly higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade but began
slipping in early trading.
   Traders say soybeans got some help from reports of dry weather
in Brazil's main bean area, which creates the prospect of reduced
yields there.
   Light movement of corn and wheat in this country supported those
grains on the Board of Trade. However, traders said gains were
limited by dull export demand.
   In early dealings, wheat was { cent lower to 1\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $2.96\ a bushel; corn
was unchanged to { cent lower with $2.05{ a bushel; oats were
unchanged to { cent higher with March at $1.89 a bushel; and
soybeans were 1 cent to 2\ cents higher with March at $6.15 a

   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent lower to .03 cent higher with the

<HEAD>South Korean Economy Expected to Grow 8 Percent This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brisk exports will help South Korea's
economy grow by at least 8 percent this year, the Economic Planning
Board said.
   In its revised economic management program issued Wednesday, the
agency forecast that South Korea's gross national product would
swell to the equivalent of $145 billion, up 8 percent from last
year.
   That would boost the country's per capita GNP for this year to
$3,450, up $637 from last year, the planning board said.
   Under the original projections, 1988 GNP was expected to reach
$124 billion for a per capita GNP of $2,922.
   The GNP is the total output of goods and services a country
produces in a year.
   Government officials said stronger-than-expected exports so far
this year have prompted them to revise the projections upward.
   South Korea's merchandise exports during January and February
reached $8.01 billion, up 39.9 percent from the same period last
year.
   At that pace, total 1988 exports would rise to $55 billion and
imports to $50 billion, creating a trade surplus of $5 billion,
according to the revised figures.
   The projected trade surplus, combined with an expected surplus
of $2 billion in invisible trade items such as tourism income,
would help South Korea register a current-account surplus of $7
billion this year.
   Helped by strong exports, South Korea's current-account surplus
more than doubled to $9.78 billion last year from the 1986 level.
   The current account measures trade in goods and services plus
certain unilateral transfers.
   The projected current-account surplus would help South Korea
trim its external debts to $31 billion from $35.6 billion at the
end of last year, the agency said.
   An additional 354,000 new jobs would be created this year but
the unemployment rate would rise to 3.7 percent from 3.1 percent
last year, it said.

<HEAD>A.E. Hotchner: From Hemingway to Newman's Salad Dressing</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A.E. Hotchner traveled with Ernest Hemingway,
has authored best-selling books and scripted plays. This is not the
man one expects to find running a food business, but there he is,
assuming the role of entrepreneur at the behest of another of his
famous friends, Paul Newman.
   Listening to Hotchner talk, one gets the feeling he is also
incredulous _ even after six years _ to find himself in charge of
Newman's Own Inc., a $40 million-a-year business Hotchner calls
``this wacko food thing.''
   And the author's wife, Ursula, a former researcher at Time Inc.,
also seems a little bewildered to be overseeing the day-to-day
operations of a company that manufactures salad dressing, spaghetti
sauce, lemonade and popcorn.
   So, how did these neophytes get into the business? By the
persistence and persuasiveness of Paul Newman, the star of films
such as ``The Hustler'' and ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid''
and the president of Newman's Own.
   They started the company in 1982, with a vinaigrette dressing.
   ``Newman was always into salad dressing,'' Hotchner recalled
during a recent interview.
   Hotchner said the actor had his own homemade dressing. When he
visited friends, he took bottles of it with him. He gave it as
Christmas presents.
   One Christmas, he beseeched Hotchner, his longtime friend and
neighbor in Westport, Conn., to help fill wine bottles with
dressing, and when there was some left over, Newman got the notion
of selling it.
   ``I did everything to ignore him,'' Hotchner said.
   But Newman wouldn't let go of the idea. While he went off to
film ``The Verdict,'' he put his friend to work, setting up a salad
dressing company.
   ``He would call from the movie set between takes: `Hotch, how
are we doing? You got a bottler?''' the author recalled. ``He drove
me nuts.''
   With a $40,000 investment, they began to market the dressing
locally in Connecticut.
   ``We didn't know what we were doing,'' Hotchner admitted.
   But after two months they began to get orders from major
supermarket chains like Grand Union and A&P.
   So they hired Advantage Food Marketing, a company on Long Island
that found factories, set up a national distribution network and
arranged for publicity.
   The salad dressing, with a drawing of Newman smiling expansively
on the label, became enormously successful. The Hotchners became
corporate vice presidents.
   Hotchner sounds like he still does not believe it all happened.
``It was 80 percent luck,'' he said.
   The Newman aura was a major factor in their initial success,
Hotchner admitted. But, he said, what has kept the company going
since then is its insistence on quality.
   ``You can get acceptance because of Paul's face on the label,
but what's in the bottle better be good,'' he said.
   While quality was a major concern, profits weren't.
   ```Look, we don't intend to be food tycoons, so let's just give
it all away,''' Hotchner quoted Newman as saying. In the six years
since Newman's Own began, it has donated $15 million to charity and
helped set up a camp for seriously ill children.
   People expected Newman's Own to come out with another dressing
after the vinaigrette caught on, but as Mrs. Hotchner put it, ``We
don't do logical things.''
   So, next came spaghetti sauce, followed by popcorn and most
recently, lemonade. As its product base expanded, the company's
sales grew by 20 percent a year, Hotchner said.
   Hotchner _ the A.E. stands for Aaron Edward _ is a 67-year-old
St. Louis native who attended Washington University, became a
lawyer but hated it and then went off to serve in World War II.
After the war, he worked for Cosmopolitan magazine, and while on an
assignment in Cuba in 1948, met Ernest Hemingway.
   With Hemingway, Hotchner traveled to Paris, Madrid, Havana,
Venice _ ``not a bad way to be introduced to Venice,'' he now says
_ and other cities. He hunted with Hemingway, watched bullfights
with him and drank with him.
   Hemingway killed himself in 1961. Hotchner wrote of their
friendship in his best-known work, ``Papa Hemingway.''
   It was Hemingway who indirectly brought the future food makers
together.
   In 1956, Hotchner was asked to adapt a three-page Hemingway
story, ``The Battler,'' for television. One of the actors in the
drama was Paul Newman.
   The two men became friends, and later, neighbors in Westport, an
affluent suburb of New York City.
   They owned boats and fished together, but ``Paul and I never got
involved in anything over the years other than mischief until this
wacko food thing came up,'' Hotchner said.
   He sounds disparaging of the business and his own role in it,
but he's committed to it, fielding inquiries from Advantage Foods
at 7:45 a.m. if necessary. He manages to keep his literary projects
going, but said he sometimes feels like he's a juggler who ``has
one apple too many.''
   Both Hotchner and his wife give a lot of credit for the success
of Newman's Own to Advantage Foods and David Kalman, a vice
president at the marketing company.
   ``He was out there hustling,'' Mrs. Hotchner said. ``He believed
in us.''
   Kalman handles what Hotchner calls the nitty-gritty of the
business, dealing with the factories and workers.
   But there is still enough to keep the Hotchners busy. The night
before the interview, Mrs. Hotchner returned from West Germany,
where she met with one of the company's international distributors.
   Mrs. Hotchner, 44, a native of Cologne, West Germany, is in the
Newman's Own office in Westport almost every day, supervising a
staff of five people. Although they began as amateurs, the
Hotchners said they have learned plenty about the angles of running
a food business. In the early going, for example, they discovered
that if they discounted Newman's Own products, supermarkets would
pay faster and the company would have the cash to pay its own bills.
   But the couple is well aware that unlike most business people,
they have the luxury of nothing to lose.
   ``We don't have to produce $3 million every month,'' Hotchner
said. ``No heads are going to fall. No executives are going to be
out on the street.''
   ``It's not like anything else,'' he said. ``It's mostly fun.''

<HEAD>Sex Discrimination Suit Hailed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge approved a settlement
Tuesday of a sex-discrimination suit against State Farm Insurance
Co. that grants women who were denied jobs as insurance agents in
California up to $420,000 each.
   The settlement, restricted to California because the case was
filed as a state class-action suit, also requires that 50 percent
of the sales agents hired by the company during the next 10 years
be women.
   Lawyers for three women who sued on behalf of the discrimination
victims said the total award could range between $100 million and
$300 million, a record for a civil rights suit, based on 1,100 jobs
that were filled between 1974 and 1987, the years covered by the
suit.
   But company lawyers say the payment estimate is far too high in
light of the stringent test claimants will have to meet.
   To qualify for an award, a woman must not only show that she was
rejected or was discouraged from applying for an agent's job during
the period, but also convince a court-appointed fact-finder that
she was more qualified than the man who was hired. She would then
collect between $15,575 and $420,822, which includes the amount of
pay she was wrongfully denied and interest on that figure. The
women would receive additional interest from now until the date
they are paid.
   The suit was filed in 1979 by three former company secretaries,
Muriel Kraszewski of Los Angeles County, Wilda Tipton of Ventura
County and Daisy Jackson of Santa Clara County, who has since died.
Under the settlement, each, including Ms. Jackson's estate, will
get the maximum award of $420,822.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson ruled in 1985 that State
Farm had discriminated against women in hiring, prompting the
settlement negotiations.
   Henderson approved the settlement Tuesday after a brief hearing,
calling it fair and comprehensive. He deferred a ruling, however,
on whether some women would be allowed to sue separately in state
court on discrimination claims.
   The four-month claims period will begin May 1. Women who applied
for jobs with the company between 1974 and 1987 will be mailed
claim forms, said Guy Saperstein, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.

   Aspiring Wall Street broker Bud Fox thought he
had a deal that couldn't go wrong. He would make a killing in the
stock market by trading on inside information about secret takeover
plans for Bluestar Airlines.
   Fox _ the fictional focus of the movie ``Wall Street'' _ didn't
count on getting nailed by a computer.
   His trades sent the airline stock into an erratic flight
pattern, which sounded an alarm in the control tower of the New
York Stock Exchange.
   As it might have unfolded in real life, the exchange's ``stock
watch'' monitors triggered an investigation that resulted in Fox's
arrest for securities fraud.
   Collaring Wall Street's bad guys is not always so easy, but the
movie turned the spotlight on a surveillance system that has become
the first line of defense against abuse in the stock market.
   ``They stole it from us,'' joked Donald J. Solodar, the NYSE's
senior vice president for market surveillance, who supervises a
staff of more than 100.
   At the center of the Big Board's operation are four analysts who
scrutinize oddly behaving stocks from a carpeted, glass-walled
office crammed with computer terminals and newswire printers high
above the exchange floor.
   Solodar's detectives have played roles in exposing some of the
biggest insider traders in history, ranging from former LTV Corp.
executive Paul Thayer to ex-investment banker Dennis B. Levine.
   In an era marked by takeover speculation and daily volume that
has multiplied 12-fold over 20 years, tracking suspicious trades
has become a high-tech adventure.
   ``In 1965, we averaged a few million shares a day. We read
ticker tape and clipped items from the papers,'' said Solodar,
whose NYSE career began then as an investigator. ``You didn't have
all the mergers and acquisition stuff.''
   On a typical trading day now, dozens of computer alerts about
unusual stock activity go off in the monitoring rooms at the New
York and American exchanges in Manhattan and the National
Association of Securities Dealers on-line office in Washington,
which follows over-the-counter trading.
   The computers are programmed to know the price and volume
behavior of every listed issue over the past several months, which
stock watchers call a parameter or ``fingerprint.'' When a sleepy
stock suddenly jumps in value, the computers send out their
warnings.
   They range from colored lights at the NYSE to a synthesized
voice that shouts ``high price!'' or ``volume!'' in the Amex's
``Stockwatch Automated Technique'' system, dubbed ``SWAT'' for
short.
   ``It doesn't mean by necessity there's a violation,'' said
Solodar. ``But when you have a 200 million-share day you need that
computer support to guide the analysts. Once those flags or
whistles go off, we try to ascertain whether there's public news to
account for it.''
   The news could include relatively innocuous events such as a
dividend payment, earnings report, stock repurchase or a buy
recommendation from a respected investment firm.
   When 32.4 million shares of Detroit Edison stock changed hands
March 8, for example, NYSE analysts ignored their computer's
red-alert, the most serious warning. They knew investors were
trading the stock based on the company's quarterly dividend.
   When more than 600 million shares were traded during the Oct. 19
crash, volume warnings blazed across every computer screen, but
analysts paid little heed because massive selling affected many
stocks.
   If an analyst cannot determine the source of a stock's curious
behavior, the next step is to call the exchange floor for an
explanation. The analyst also might call the company and brokers
who traded the stock.
   ``More times than not it takes more than something on the screen
to figure it out,'' said Solodar. ``It doesn't flash, `insider
trader.'''
   If questions persist, a mysterious trading pattern might be
referred to an exchange investigator and possibly the Securities
and Exchange Commission, which is ultimately responsible for
enforcing securities laws.
   A common example is a stock that suspiciously rises in price,
suggesting an impending takeover that hasn't been disclosed.
Insiders with advance knowledge of that information might be buying
illegally, knowing the stock's price will jump after the takeover
is announced.
   The SEC has sharply increased its prosecution of these insider
trading violations over the past few years. But in most cases, the
agency must rely partly on evidence of wrongdoing supplied by the
stock markets themselves.
   ``I guess we're more like the cops on the beat,'' said Jay S.
Bono, head of the Amex system in a cramped office 10 stories above
the trading floor. ``I think we deter members from getting involved
in shady things. They know what we do.''
   Bono oversees three analysts who work in perhaps the most
advanced surveillance system of any exchange, with
synthesized-voice computers that not only shout warnings but also
read news from a financial information service to advise analysts
of market-sensitive developments.
   The Amex operation also includes about 60 staffers who follow up
leads uncovered by the stock watchers. Like the NYSE, Amex's system
has been credited for exposing many illicit trades, notably the
conspiracy that resulted in the arrest and conviction of former
Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans a few years ago.
Winans had peddled advance knowledge of his ``Heard on the Street''
column, which often influenced the price of a stock he wrote about.
   In a typical day, Bono's stock watchers will arrive an hour
before the exchange opens and talk with floor traders to acquaint
themselves with the latest news and gossip. They also will scour
the newspapers and overnight copy from financial wire services.
   The Amex computer ordinarily will record about 100 daily alerts,
called ``kickouts'' or ``parameter breaks.'' Bono said about half
are readily explainable and the others require further inquiry.
   Ultimately, a few might be referred to an Amex investigator and
about 50 a year are referred to the SEC, Bono said.
   NYSE stock watchers conduct a similar screening process, also
referring about 50 trades a year to the SEC. Solodar didn't
disclose the number of outstanding in-house inquiries but said it
exceeds 100.
   Does the operation deter wrongdoers?
   ``In a broad sense I would say yes,'' observed Solodar. ``But if
somebody wants to be a crook, they're going to be one, irrespective
of the bells and alarms that are available to us.''

   Koppers Co.'s board today rejected a $1.27
billion takeover bid from a group led by Beazer PLC and Shearson
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and said it is mulling a
recapitalization plan to fend off unwanted suitors.
   British investor Brian Beazer, who heads the London-based
construction concern, and Shearson Lehman launched a $45-per-share
tender offer for Koppers' common shares on March 3. Koppers
management today called the offer inadequate and recommended
stockholders not tender their shares.
   Beazer, Shearson and NatWest Investment Bank Ltd., a British
investment bank, reportedly own about 7.45 percent of Koppers'
outstanding common shares.
   The Pittsburgh-based road builder and manufacturer of
construction materials said in a statement its board is
``considering alternative plans intended to enhance shareholder
values both immediately and over the long term.''
   Koppers shares fell 75 cents to $53.75 in early trading on the
New York Stock Exchange after jumping $2.25 on Tuesday.
   Charles Pullin, Koppers' chairman, said the board is considering
a recapitalization plan that would involve a ``substantial cash
distribution or dividend'' to common shareholders.
   He said the company will explore the sale of some or all of its
construction materials and services business, the proceeds of which
would be used to fund the dividend payout.
   Beazer has said it probably would sell Koppers' chemical
business if it gained control.
   Pullin said a recapitalization also could include the sale of
stock to an employee stock ownership plan that the company would
establish.
   ``Koppers' board believes that the company remaining independent
would, over the long term, be a superior alternative to accepting''
the buyout offer, the company said.
   Koppers said the Beazer-Shearson offer to pay $107.75 for each
of the 150,000 outstanding shares of preferred stock was adequate
but declined to advise preferred shareholders whether to tender
their stock.
   Beazer and Shearson made their bid through BNS Inc.

   In October 1983, a computer at the American
Stock Exchange sounded an alarm about TIE Communications shares,
which were slipping in extraordinarily active trading.
   It was the beginning of the end for the career of R. Foster
Winans, a Wall Street Journal reporter who played a key role in
what would become one of the most publicized insider trading
conspiracies in history.
   A day after the TIE alarm, a negative story about the company
appeared in Winans' ``Heard on the Street'' column, which made the
stock tumble even more.
   ``It looked like it was intentionally made to do a job on TIE,''
said Jay S. Bono, head of the Amex stock watch unit, where
suspicions arose that something was seriously wrong.
   Shortly thereafter, the Amex computer sounded the alarm about
Key Pharmaceuticals shares, which were falling in heavy volume. A
few days later, a negative story about Key appeared in the
``Heard'' column and TIE pattern repeated itself.
   ``Then we alerted our surveillance department, saying, `This is
amazing. Definitely look at this sucker,'' Bono recalled.
   Amex investigators began checking records to determine which
brokerages had been active in TIE and Key in the days before the
``Heard'' columns appeared.
   Their inquiries showed significant trading was done by Peter N.
Brant, then a star trader for Kidder Peabody & Co., and two of
Brant's friends, Kenneth P. Felis, and David W.C. Clark.
   Before TIE and Key fell, they had been aggressively buying ``put
options'' on the stocks, entitling them to sell at a certain price
within a specified time. The options soared in value when the
stocks declined.
   Securities and Exchange Commission investigators were alerted,
and eventually the Journal's senior management. It was almost
certain that Brant, Felis and Clark had known the pre-publication
contents of the ``Heard'' column.
   Faced with exposure, Winans told the SEC of a secret arrangement
under which he would leak advance word of the ``Heard'' column to
Brant and the broker would share the trading profits he made with
Winans and Winans' male lover, David J. Carpenter.
   All were prosecuted for insider trading.
   In a book about the conspiracy, Winans wrote that none of the
participants had been aware market stock watchers would be alerted
by their trading, especially Brant, who had ``muscled his way into
TIE like a refugee trying to catch the last helicopter out of
Saigon.''
   In hindsight, Winans wrote, ``fewer people would have noticed
what Peter was doing if he'd hired a skywriter.''
   Despite the success of such surveillance in the Winans case,
market officials concede other instances of blatant abuse can be
hard to identify. A good example was the insider trading done by
Ivan F. Boesky, a notorious speculator who was exposed by
co-conspirator Dennis B. Levine.
   Using secret tips about impending takeovers supplied by Levine,
a former investment banker, Boesky made millions of dollars buy
acquiring stocks of acquisition targets.
   ``Boesky was not a name that was foreign to us; in fact we had
tracked a number of trades by Ivan Boesky over a long period of
time,'' said Donald J. Solodar, head of the New York Stock Exchange
stock watch unit.
   ``But it's like seeing a woodsman in the forest,'' Solodar said.
``We expected him to be there. Because as a big player, we knew and
were able to see he was in many deals, many times. And there was no
discernible pattern.''
   NYSE stock watchers had better luck with Levine, who did all his
illicit trading under a phony name through an account at the
Bahamas branch of Bank Leu International Ltd., a Swiss bank.
   Solodar said his analysts forwarded to the SEC about two dozen
suspicious trading patterns over a period of several years that
originated from the Bank Leu account. SEC investigators used that
information to help identify Levine.
   ``Beyond Bank Leu, because of a jurisdictional problem, we had
to rely on the SEC,'' Solodar said. ``But we do take partial
credit.''

   The stock market drifted lower in quiet trading
today, continuing the sluggish pattern of the past two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.94 to 2,037.47
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 511 up, 770 down and
543 unchanged.
   The market has been in a holding pattern since the start of the
week as traders await Thursday's report on the nation's trade
balance for January.
   Most economists look for a modest increase in the trade deficit
after two months of pronounced declines. If the figures match those
expectations, analysts believe the market wouldn't feel any great
shock effects.
   But traders apparently are sticking with a cautious approach
until then so as not to be caught off guard by any surprise either
way.
   After the trade report, the market is also faced with a
quarterly ``triple witching hour'' involving a series of stock
index options and futures that will be settled Friday.
   That too may pass quietly, brokers say, but until it is over it
adds an additional element of uncertainty for investors.

<HEAD>Crude Oil Production Fell, Imports Rose in February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domestic crude oil production dropped again last
month, while increased imports continued to feed the nation's
ever-growing thirst for petroleum-based products, a trade group
reported Wednesday.
   The nation's output of crude dropped 1.8 percent from January to
8.16 million barrels a day _ a fall of 11 percent from the level of
two years ago, the American Petroleum Institute said in its monthly
report.
   At the same time, daily imports averaged 6.66 million barrels of
crude and products, which was up 14.8 percent from 5.8 million
barrels a day in February 1987, the Washington-based group said.
   That marked a 38 percent increase in imports from February 1986,
when the nation bought 4.84 million barrels of foreign crude and
products each day, said Joe Lastelic, an API spokesman. A barrel is
the equivalent of 42 gallons.
   February's deliveries of refined products increased by 2.5
percent, or 417,000 barrels daily, reflecting expected trends in
actual consumption after an unusual 7 percent year-to-year leap in
January, the report said.
   Gasoline led the increase in deliveries of refined products,
rising 2.6 percent from last February. On a year-to-date basis,
however, this worked out to an expected 2 percent gain when
adjusted for unusual factors, the trade group said.
   The report said annual domestic consumption of motor fuels has
grown by 2.2 percent to 3.2 percent a year in the 1982-1987 period,
as Americans traveled nearly 3.8 percent more each year.
   Among other highlights, the API reported that:
   _February deliveries of home heating oil and diesel fuel were
essentially flat, compared with February 1987, partly because
weather in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states was warmer than
usual.
   _Heavy fuel oil, known as residual fuel oil, rose 2 percent from
the previous February, apparently reflecting ``the competitive
nature of the fuel in the electric utility and industrial markets.''
   _Kerosine jet fuel deliveries fell a sharp 3.5 percent from a
year ago, in part because of heavy inventory buildup in January.
   _The utilization rate of the nation's refineries slackened to
81.9 percent from an average 83 percent use over the winter months,
as the winter heating season wound down.
   _Inventories of crude and products dropped 1.6 percent from
January and 2 pecent from February 1987.

<HEAD>Tyler Company Agrees to Let Getty Become Majority Stockholder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A son of late oil billionaire J. Paul
Getty will become a majority stockholder in DeltaUS Corp. under an
agreement reached with the financially troubled Tyler drilling
company.
   The 57-year-old Delta USCorp. last turned a profit in the oil
boom year of 1981.
   An unnamed corporation owned wholly by Gordon P. Getty is to pay
$7 million for newly issued shares of common stock in Delta, giving
Getty 75 percent ownership of the Tyler company, Delta chairman
Keating Zeppa said Tuesday.
   The agreement also calls for the Getty-owned corporation to
provide Delta with a $2.5 million cash infusion to help finance its
weakened drilling operations.
   Zeppa said Delta suffered a net loss in excess of $10 million
last year on revenues of $51 million.
   The company has 1,100 employees, less than half its peak
employment of about 2,400 workers in 1982. Only 13 of its 50
U.S.-based rigs are active, Zeppa said. Six of seven Delta rigs in
Italy are in operation.
   The agreement with Getty should ``give us the ability to
withstand worse-case conditions for three to four years and still
be around when things turn up (in the drilling industry),'' Zeppa
said.
   Zeppa said Getty does not anticipate any changes in management
or current operations.
   Getty, 54, is a resident of San Francisco and reportedly has no
plans to assume an executive role with Delta.
   Getty played a major role in 1984 merger talks involving Getty
Oil Co. and Houston-based Pennzoil Co.
   Texaco Inc. wound up making a higher bid and buying the
California-based company.
   A Houston jury in 1985 awarded the largest court judgment in
history _ $10.53 billion _ to Pennzoil, which had argued that
Texaco had improperly interfered with the proposed Pennzoil-Getty
merger.
   Texaco has since agreed to pay Pennzoil $3 billion to settle the
case.

<HEAD>Union at Kenosha Chrysler plant plans to approach shareholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers Local 72 plans to
approach Chrysler Corp. stockholders in its fight to keep as many
of the automaker's jobs in Kenosha as possible this fall when car
assembly is scheduled to end here.
   Ed Steagall, president of the local, said Tuesday the union
plans to solicit proxies from stockholders in time for Chrysler's
May 19 shareholder meeting in New York.
   Steagall said the union is ``contacting somebody to see how to
obtain the maximum amount of proxies'' and would announce its
strategy at a news conference.
   Asked what the proxies would say, Steagall said the union has
not set a complete agenda.
   A proxy is a ballot that empowers somebody to vote for another.
   Joseph Philippi, an auto analyst at Shearson Lehman and Hutton
in New York, said he doubts the union could get enough votes to
make Chrysler's board of directors change its mind about halting
assembly operations at Kenosha.
   But he said the proxies could serve as a show of support for the
union cause.
   ``It's a means of registering protest,'' he said. ``In terms of
the effectiveness, I seriously doubt they're going to get enough
votes for it.''
   Baron Bates, Chrysler vice president of public affairs, the
company is on the verge of sending out its proxies, said the UAW
itself is a big Chrysler shareholder. Several Local 72 members also
own shares which they got in a stock swap after Chrysler bought
American Motors Corp. last August.
   Chrysler said Jan. 27 that it would stop car assembly at Kenosha
by September, wiping out 5,500 jobs. It, however, intends to
preserve about 1,000 jobs in continuing engine operations.

<HEAD>IBM Scientists Create Fastest Silicon Circuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists at International Business Machines
Corp. have made and tested the world's fastest silicon circuits,
the company said Wednesday.
   IBM said the experimental circuits could switch on and off 75
billion times a second, twice as fast as the fastest silicon
transistors known to date.
   The extra speed was made possible by shrinking the circuit parts
down to a tenth of a micron across, which is one-thousandth the
width of a human hair and only a few hundred atoms wide.
   The company cautioned that complex problems remain to be solved
before entire chips can be made that take full advantage of the
experimental transistors.
   IBM's advance helps close the speed gap between silicon and
gallium arsenide, another kind of semiconducting material that is
faster than silicon but more expensive and harder to work with.
   The fastest gallium arsenide circuits can switch on and off
about 200 billion times a second, IBM said.

   General Electric Co. said its scientists have
put a superconducting film on a silicon chip and gotten it to work
at temperatures warmer than liquid nitrogen, the first such
achievement.
   The matching of a superconductor and silicon is considered
important because of silicon's dominance in the microelectronics
field, GE said in an announcement for release Thursday.
   ``Virtually all of the world's microchips are made from silicon,
so if you want to use the new superconducting materials in any way
in microelectronics, it is advantageous to be able to deposit them
on this substrate,'' Antonio Mogro-Campero, who did the research
along with Larry G. Turner, said in a statement.
   Previous attempts to apply a superconducting film on silicon had
failed because the layers mixed in the process of heating the film,
known as annealing. Researchers at GE's research center in
Schenectady, N.Y., solved the problem by using a buffer layer of
zirconia, a heat-resistant metallic oxide.
   GE said the thin film remained superconducting _ that is, with
zero loss of energy to resistance _ at temperatures as high as 310
degrees below zero Fahrenheit, 10 degrees above the point at which
nitrogen becomes liquid.

<HEAD>Black & Decker May Offer More For American Standard</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New info and editing throughout to include court ruling
today.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black & Decker Corp. says it may submit
another takeover bid for American Standard Inc., which is
considering rival bids to the power tool maker's $2.27 billion
offer.
   American Standard says it has at least one all-cash bid of more
than $75 per share. Black & Decker's hostile tender offer is for
$73 a share.
   The plumbing and air conditioning maker has said it was
negotiating with several potential buyers, including one willing to
pay at least $2.4 billion.
   American Standard's board was meeting today to consider
definitive bids arising out of talks with other suitors,
spokeswoman Lois Stewart said.
   The result of the meeting was considered pivotal to the outcome
of a six-week takeover battle that has pushed American Standard's
stock price from $38 to an all-time high above $75 a share.
   In a related development today that might influence the fight, a
judge in Delaware, where American Standard is incorporated, granted
a Black & Decker request at least temporarily prohibiting American
Standard from making defensive changes in its retirement and
severence pay plan.
   Black & Decker had argued the changes would cost the company
more money only if it were acquired by a third party, while
producing little effect under a recapitalization plan American
Standard is considering, said Black & Decker attorney Robert Zimet.
   On Tuesday, Black & Decker spokeswoman Barbara Lucas said the
company was reviewing internal financial information supplied by
American Standard and was expected to make a decision on whether to
offer a new bid.
   If Black & Decker doesn't submit a new bid, it would be taking
the chance that American Standard's management might strike a deal
with another bidder, she acknowledged.
   Industry analysts said that American Standard's internal
five-year growth projections, made public by Black & Decker Monday,
appeared to back a bid in the $75-a-share range.
   ``Taken at face value, these numbers seem to support a bid
higher than $73, but it's hard to say whether they support a bid
higher than $75,'' said Franklin Morton, of Alex. Brown & Sons in
Baltimore. ``There's a significant downside to these numbers
because they're based on a pretty optimistic scenario.''
   He said a $73 bid would enhance Black & Decker's aim of
broadening its earnings base but questioned whether that objective
would be reached at a higher price.
   Other analysts noted that American Standard's estimates are
based on a business climate similar to that of the past year.
   Cornelius Sewell, an analyst at Argus Securities in New York,
said the projections don't reflectthe cyclical downturn expected to
affect the building supplies industry, to which American Standard
sells air-conditioning and plumbing products.
   Katherine Stults, an analyst at Dean Witter, said a bid in the
$75 range might be attractive to a company that specializes in
buying going concerns and selling them off in parts.
   There has been little speculation over the identity of American
Standard's potential suitors. Wickes Cos. Inc., a major
home-improvement and furnishings company based in Santa Monica,
Calif., has been mentioned, as well as Textron Inc., a $7 billion
aerospace, automotive products and financial services conglomerate
based in Providence, R.I. Hanson Trust PLC, a $10 billion London
industrial management conglomerate, has also been mentioned as a
possible white knight.

   A judge has postponed until April 12
hearings in the $3 billion compensation suit filed by the
government against Union Carbide Corp. for the 1984 Bhopal gas
disaster, it was reported.
   Bhopal District Judge M.W. Deo on Wednesday delayed the hearings
because of an appeal in the Madhya Pradesh High Court against an
order directing Carbide to pay $350 million in interim relief to
the gas disaster victims. The high court has scheduled its hearing
on the appeal for April 4.
   Deo had ordered Carbide to pay interim relief in December. The
compensation suit was filed in his court by the government in
September 1986.
   The government says the Danbury, Conn.-based multinational
corporation is responsible for the poisonous gas leak from the
Carbide plant in Bhopal. Union Carbide says the leak was caused by
sabotage.
   At least 2,800 people were killed and more than 20,000 injured
in the Dec. 3, 1984 disaster, considered the world's biggest
industrial accident.

   Swedish researchers have developed an
electronic identity card for cars so that drivers can pay tolls
without stopping, according to a spokesman for the company which is
marketing the invention.
   The 5-by-6 centimeter (2-by-2.4 inch) plate on the rear window
identifies the car by a microwave transmitter to a computer when
the car passes a toll booth at normal speed, said Stig Rune
Johansson, of Kista Industrier AB.
   He said the small town of Aalesund on Norway's western coast
became the first to try the system last October. It was developed
at Stockholm's Institute for Microelectronics.
   About half the 3,000 cars passing through Aalesund's tunnel
every day never stop and pay the fee. The information is
transmitted to the car owners' bank, and charges are automatically
deducted once a month.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Oil Ministry and U.S., Italian and
Japanese companies signed an agreement Wednesday that would create
the Soviet Union's largest joint business venture with foreigners.
   Under the $6 billion deal, the venture would build and operate a
petrochemical complex off the Caspian Sea in the Central Asian
republic of Kazakhstan. It is expected to produce 400,000 tons of
polypropylene, 600,000 tons of polyethylene and more than 1 million
tons of granulated sulfur annually.
   Polypropylene and polyehylene are used to make plastics.
   The foreign partners are Occidental Petroleum Corp. of Los
Angeles, the Italian companies of Montedison and Enichem and
Marubeni of Japan.
   Officials of the four companies signed a preliminary agreement
with Soviet representatives on Wednesday, committing them to study
plans for the petrochemical complex for nine months before
completing a long-range contract.
   Montedison Chairman Raul Gardini said the Soviets had invited
the four companies to establish the joint venture.
   ``It reflects the necessity for the Soviet Union to get involved
in the world market and the necessity for Western firms to get
closer to sources of raw materials in order to process them more
efficiently at the sites,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union has vast natural resources, and is the world's
largest oil producer.
   Vassily A. Dinkov, Soviet oil minister, told a news conference
that housing for the petrochemical workers, roads, a railroad link,
electricity and communications facilities are under construction
for the complex, which will be built near the western Kazakh town
of Kulsary.
   Under the agreement, Dinkov said, gas and oil extraction
facilities are to be operating next year, with refining plants
following within the next few years. Oil reserves in the deposit,
known as the Tengiz Oil Field, are estimated at between 14 billion
and 17.5 billion barrels, Dinkov said.
   Foreign participants will hold a total of no more than 49
percent of the joint venture's capital, with the rest held by the
Soviet government.
   Occidental Chairman Armand Hammer told the news conference each
of the foreign partners will invest $750 million in the project,
and the Soviets will put in $3 billion. The Western partners will
utilize bank financing, he said.
   Previous joint ventures, which have sprung up under Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's overhaul of the Soviet economy, have been worth in the
millions of dollars.
   The foreign partners will sell half the complex's products
abroad. The Soviets will sell the other half, either domestically
or on the world market.
   Hammer, whose business ties with the Soviets date to the 1920s,
expressed confidence that the Western partners will find the deal
financially satisfying.
   ``We're not here for charitable purposes,'' he said. ``We, each
of the four companies, expect to make profits.''

   The stock market declined slightly in quiet

sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.11 to 2,038.30

   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 557 up, 797 down and

   The market has been in a holding pattern since the start of the
week as traders await Thursday's report on the nation's trade
balance for January.
   Most economists look for a modest increase in the trade deficit
after two months of pronounced declines. If the figures match those
expectations, analysts believe the market wouldn't feel any great
shock effects.
   But traders apparently are sticking with a cautious approach
until then so as not to be caught off guard by any surprise either
way.
   After the trade report, the market is also faced with a
quarterly ``triple witching hour'' involving a series of stock
index options and futures that will be settled Friday.
   That too may pass quietly, brokers say, but until it is over it
adds an additional element of uncertainty for investors.

<HEAD>Retailing Giant Buying Western Auto Supply</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. is expanding its role in
specialty retailing with a plan announced Wednesday to buy Western
Auto Supply Co. in a $402 million deal.
   Sears said it was buying 52.3 percent of Western Auto stock from
officers, directors and others for $19 a share and will make a
tender offer for the remainder of the stock at the same price.
   The acquisition will cost the nation's biggest retailer $250
million. It also will assume the auto supply company's $152 million
debt.
   Western Auto's stock, traded on the over-the-counter market,
rose $5.87{ a share to $18.37{ by Wednesday afternoon.
   John Landschultz, a financial analyst in Chicago with Mesirow
Financial Corp., said this was probably the first of several steps
Sears would take to increase its presence in the specialty field.
   ``This move does several things that were needed,'' said
Landschultz.
   First, he said, it gets Sears out of the major malls where it
has had a dominent influence and into the smaller markets. It also
capitalizes on Sears' strength in automotive parts and equipment.
   Western Auto sells auto supplies, tires, appliances and lawn and
garden equipment through nearly 2,000 stores nationwide.
   The Kansas City-based company operates 278 retail stores it
owns, and sells wholesale to 1,570 independently owned Western Auto
outlets.
   Sears said John T. Lundegard, Western Auto's chairman and chief
executive officer, will remain as head of the auto supply unit and
will report to Alfred G. Goldstein, president of Sears' specialty
merchandising.
   These personnel decisions are significant, said Landschultz.
   ``It's very important that (Lundegard) stays in place,'' he
said, adding that Goldstein has been extremely successful in the
specialty field.
   The acquisition would represent Sears' further expansion into
specialty marketing. It previously bought apparel and optical
chains.
   But the Western Auto deal is the first significant move in this
direction, said Landschultz.
   Last year, Western Auto earned $10.5 million on sales of $930.8
million. Sears earned $1.65 billion and had revenues of $48.44
billion.

<HEAD>Lytle Exceeded Lending Authority, Court Told</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former vice president of Continental Illinois
National Bank & Trust Co. exceeded his authority and improperly
approved risky loans in the years before the bank's near-collapse,
a former lending officer testified.
   John Lytle, accused of misusing bank funds, exceeded a limit of
$5 million on the amount of loans he could approve by granting
extensions on a loan, the former lending officer, Anne Liddell,
testified Tuesday.
   And she said Lytle's initials appeared on a credit reporting
form that was submitted in her name but that she did not fill out.
The form listed the history of a prospective borrower.
   ``My name was misspelled,'' she said.
   Ms. Liddell's statements came during the second day of testimony
in the five-day-old U.S. District Court trial of Lytle and two
other men.
   Lytle headed energy lending in Oklahoma for Contintental. The
government has accused him of buying high-risk loans from the
now-defunct Penn Square Bank in Oklahoma City in exchange for
nearly $600,000 in kickbacks between 1980 and 1982.
   Defendant William Patterson, former head of energy lending at
Penn Square, gave the kickbacks to Lytle in the form of unsecured
personal loans, the government contends.
   A third defendant, Tulsa oil driller Jere Sturgis, is accused of
purchasing oil-well investments from Lytle at inflated prices in
hopes of getting future loans from Continental.
   All three are charged with multiple counts of wire fraud. Lytle
and Patterson are also charged with misapplication of bank funds.
   The 1982 failure of Penn Square Bank jolted Continental, which
was rescued in a massive bailout by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. two years later.

<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wickes Cos. Inc. said Wednesday it
is negotiating to sell the Kayser-Roth Hosiery Group to members of
the unit's management and Narragansett Capital Inc. of New York.
   The hosiery unit, based in Greensboro, N.C., is one of the
world's leading manufacturers of men's and women's hosiery,
including such brands as No Nonsense, Liz Clairborne, Calvin Klein,
Burlington and Supp-Hose.
   It has 9,600 workers at 16 manufacturing plants and four
distribution centers in the United States and Europe.
   The Kayser-Roth units were part of Gulf & Western Industries'
consumer and industrial products segment that was acquired by
Wickes for $1 billion in 1985.
   The hosiery group was one of three units put on the auction
block by Wickes last October. The others are its Kayser-Roth
Apparel Group and Wickes Lumber.
   None of the three has been sold. Wickes had tentatively agreed
to sell the lumber segment to members of management, but that deal
was called off in January because of financing problems. The lumber
unit's management group is seeking other financing and Wickes is
looking at other possible buyers.
   The three units last year had sales of $1.8 billion and
operating income of $80 million. Of that, the hosiery group
accounted for $500 million in sales, but no operating income
figures were disclosed.
   Wickes has said that proceeds from the asset sales will be used
to buy back stock, pay debt and possibly fund acquisitions to
expand continuing operations.
   The management group leading the buyout talks includes James I.
Spiegel, who was president of the consumer and industrial products
units and corporate senior executive vice president at Gulf &
Western and later at Wickes, and Michael C. Proies, president of No
Nonsense Fashions Inc. Spiegel retired from Wickes in early 1986.
   Narragansett is a private investment firm that manages over $500
million in risk capital. Industrial companies that make up its
investment portfolio have sales of about $1 billion a year.
Narragansett also owns several radio and television stations and
cable TV systems serving more than 350,000 subscribers.

   Business took precedence over brotherhood in a
suit that ended in U.S. District Court when Michael B. Shane was
awarded $1.3 million after suing his brother and partners six years
ago.
   Michael Shane is the founder of Leading Edge Products Inc. of
Canton, a leading supplier of Asian-made clones of IBM personal
computers, in 1980.
   The case decided by a jury Tuesday involved Appendagez, a
company founded in 1973 that sold a popular brand of blue jeans
called Faded Glory.
   Michael Shane was 25 and had made $1 million selling wigs when
James Ip, a Hong Kong businessman, approached him about selling
blue jeans. They were joined by Shane's brother, James Shane, and
Charles Lee, a Hong Kong businessman.
   Ip owned 14.5 percent of the Hong Kong company that made the
jeans.
   Appendagez at its peak sold $50 million to $60 million in jeans
a year, said Michael B. Keating, lawyer for Michael Shane.
   Michael Shane was president and majority stockholder of
Appendagez until 1979 when he sold his stock in the company in two
transactions.
   In January 1979, he sold 30 shares for $1.3 million. In
November, he agreed with his three partners to sell his remaining
26 shares for $50,000 and ended all business relations.
   Three years later he sued his brother and his other two former
partners, charging them with securities fraud.
   He claimed that between the times of the two transactions, the
three conspired to deceive him about the condition of Appendagez so
they could buy him out for less than his remaining shares were
worth.

cash, the company said.
   Tiger, parent of the world's oldest and largest air-cargo
concern, Flying Tiger Line Inc., wrote off its entire $132 million
investment in North American Car in 1984.
   In January, Tiger said it had reached an agreement with holders
of the North American Car debt to repay them at a discount.
   Tiger wouldn't say Wednesday how much the discount was, other
than that it was substantial.
   The $100 million in new debt is in notes that are due no later
than 1993 and are secured by a pledge of 51 percent of Flying
Tiger's stock.

   Most grain and soybean futures prices turned
weaker today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Hedge selling from South America put pressure on the soybean
market from the start, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with G.H.
Miller & Co.
   This was compounded by industry data putting the soybean crush
figure for February at 3.7 million tons, substantially lower than a
month earlier and the year-agofigure.
   The implication is that soybean processors still have large
supplies of beans.
   A lack of export interest in corn and wheat weighed on those
markets, said Gidel.
   On the close, wheat was 3 cents lower to { cent higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $2.92{ a bushel; corn was \ cent
to 1\ cents lower with March at $1.97{ a bushel; oats were } cent
lower to 1 cent higher with March at $1.89{ a bushel; and soybeans
were 2\ cents to 4{ cents lower with March at $6.11{ a bushel.

   The stock market showed some spotty losses in
quiet trading today, continuing the sluggish pattern of the past
two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.30 to 2,041.11
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 604 up, 840 down and
489 unchanged.
   The market has been in a holding pattern since the start of the
week as traders await Thursday's report on the nation's trade
balance for January.
   Most economists look for a modest increase in the trade deficit
after two months of pronounced declines. If the figures match those
expectations, analysts believe the market wouldn't feel any great
shock effects.
   But traders apparently are sticking with a cautious approach
until then so as not to be caught off guard by any surprise either
way.
   After the trade report, the market is also faced with a
quarterly ``triple witching hour'' involving a series of stock
index options and futures that will be settled Friday.
   That too may pass quietly, brokers say, but until it is over it
adds an additional element of uncertainty for investors.
   Losers among the blue chips included Merck, down 2 at 156\;
American Express, down | at 25|; USX, down { at 31[, and American
Telephone & Telegraph, down \ at 28].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.20 to 149.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .82 at 295.93.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 114.54 million shares with an

   A group of venture capitalists recently polled
will have an average of $44.8 million to invest in growing
companies this year, up 11 percent from the average earmarked for
investments last year, according to a study released Wednesday.
   Grant Thornton, the accounting and management consulting firm
that conducted the survey, notedthat 93 percent of the 183 venture
capital firms that responded said they anticipate receiving more
requests from young companies seeking funds for expansion this year
compared with the previous year.
   Forty-seven percent of the venture capitalists polled said they
would invest in more companies this year, the study said.
   Only 13 percent of the respondents said they have shifted
investment strategies since the October stock market crash, with
several noting they prefer ``later-stage'' companies that may
present less risk.
   A full 96 percent said they expect going public will be a more
difficult and lengthy process in the post-crash environment.
   Grant Thornton mailed questionnaires to 501 venture capital
firms across the country in January. The 183 completed surveys
represent at 36 percent response rate.

   Warner-Lambert Co. said it is
planning a $5 million joint venture with the People's Republic of
China to make and market chewing gum, cough drops and candies.
   The pharmaceutical company said an agreement with the Chinese
government calls for a plant to be built in the city of Harbin,

   The joint venture, to be called the Harbin Warner-Lambert
Confectionary Co. Ltd., would employ about 120 people, the company
said in an announcement Tuesday. The plant would produce Dentyne
gum, Halls cough drops and Fruitfuls candies for use in China and
for export.
   Warner-Lambert has another joint partnership with China, called
Suzhou Capsugel Ltd., which makes empty hard gelatin capsules. It
was established in 1985.

Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Societe Generale de Belgique SA
announced Tuesday that it will call a shareholders meeting on April
14, the first since Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti tried to
take control of Belgium's largest holding company two months ago.
   Cerus SA, the French investment company controlled by De
Benedetti, has called for such a meeting. Societe Generale said
Cerus and other allied companies had furnished proof that they hold
at least 20 percent of shareholder capital, the minimum percentage
required to force the calling of such a meeting.
   Societe Generale said the agenda of the meeting will include a
speech by the president of the company, Rene Lamy, and the
nomination of directors.
   In addition, the company said, there will be items on the agenda
which had been requested by Cerus.
   Cerus has said that the number of company directors must be
decided and that the nominations of De Benedetti as well as his
allies, Andre Leysen of Gevaert N.V. and Pierre Scohier of
Compagnie Belge de Participations Paribas SA, must be put forward.
   Cerus also has said that a request would be made that Societe
Generale not make use of its recent capital increase of 12 million
shares. The shares were issued by the company immediately after it
became aware of De Benedetti's takeover bid, but De Benedetti
contested the capital increase in court and the case is still under
review.
   Societe Generale claims that, together with its allies led by
France's Compagnie Financiere de Suez, it controls more than 52
percent of the company's shares. De Benedetti and his allies, on
the other hand, say they have more than 47 percent.

<HEAD>Overhaul Efforts Hurting Financial Foundation Of Defense Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts by Congress and the Pentagon to
overhaul defense contracting policies since 1984 are having the
unintended effect of dissolving the financial foundation of the
entire U.S. arms business, an industry-sponsored study said Tuesday.
   The new policies, taken together, are beginning to reduce the
industry's profitability to the point that contractors will not be
able to attract new investors, nor will they be able to sustain
their private research efforts, the study says.
   That, in turn, is going to ``slow the rate of technological
growth and result in a loss of (U.S.) technological leadership,''
the study adds.
   ``Our findings should concern those in the Congress and DoD who
believe that a strong, research-and-development and
investment-oriented defense industry is a key factor in maintaining
the United States' military strength,'' the authors wrote.
   The study, entitled ``The Impact on Defense Industrial
Capability of Changes in Procurement and Tax Policy, 1984-1987,''
was released by the Aerospace Industries Association, the
Electronic Industries Association and the National Security
Industrial Association.
   The research was funded by the three associations but performed
independently by The MAC Group, a management consulting firm based
in Cambridge, Mass.
   The three associations asked the consultant to analyze the
combined impact of a number of recent changes in the defense
procurement world, ranging from an end to certain tax deferral
benefits; a reduction in profit markup allowances; a cut in the
percentage of money paid out monthly for work in progress, and
requirements that industry pay for more of the upfront costs of
research and development.
   Those changes were all enacted or promulgated during the period
from 1984 to 1987 ``and were introduced in a piecemeal fashion,''
the study found.
   ``We find no evidence that the combined impact of the changes
was studied by the Congress or the Department of Defense,'' it said.
   While the effects of the changes may be absorbed on an
individual basis, the combined impact is devastating, the study
said.
   To demonstrate, the authors collected actual data from nine
contractors on nine large weapons programs and then applied the
various tax and contracting changes as if they had been in effect
from the start of the programs.
   ``The return on investment on the programs analyzed would have
been less than the return necessary to preserve shareholder
value,'' the report stated.
   ``Put simply, there would have been no financial reason to bid
the programs. Profits will be substantially reduced _ by an average
of 23 percent on the companies' defense business.''
   As a result of slower cash flows and lower profits, defense
contractors are almost assuredly going to have to begin borrowing
heavily, the report continued.
   Using the case studies, ``the additional financing required to
fill the gap caused by the changes _ $8.5 billion _ is equivalent
to 50 percent of the total 1985 equity of the companies in our
study.''
   The industry is unlikely to be able to raise that kind of money,
meaning it will have to slow plant modernization and curtail
private research.
   ``Competition will be reduced because there will be fewer
competitors willing to bid on future programs. And a financially
weakened industry will be less able to compete against growing, and
sometimes subsidized, foreign competition.''
   Congress and the Pentagon might not like it, but the only real
answer is to restore to contractors some of the profitability they
have lost when performing defense work, the study concluded.
   ``Equally important, the Congress should ensure that the type of
uncoordinated policy change that led to this unintended outcome is
not repeated,'' it said.

   The stock market jumped ahead in late trading
Wednesday, putting on a show of strength in advance of Thursday's
monthly report on the nation's balance of trade.
   Trading remained relatively quiet, however.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which sat for most of
the day with a modest loss, closed up 16.91 at 2,064.32.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 3 on the

   Meanwhile, the debate continues on Wall Street over whether the
market is making a sustainable comeback from the crash last fall.
   The pessimists argue that stocks are merely enjoying a ``bear
market rally'' that may not last much longer. But to date the
optimists seem to have the upper hand.
   Takeover rumors continued to abound. Pillsbury, said variously
to be a potential target for any of several financiers, gained 3~

shares.
   Similarly, U.S. Shoe climbed 2{ to 22{ and Carolina Freight

low oil prices and signs of movement in the industry toward higher
fares.
   AMR rose 1\ to 43[; Delta Air Lines 1[ to 48{; Trans World
Airlines | to 25{; NWA ] to 43~, and Allegis 2[ to 81|. Allegis
said its self-tender offer for 35.50 million of its shares at $80

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $20.24 billion, or
0.77 percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 177.08 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 2.84 to 311.39,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.52 at 268.65.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

<HEAD>Murdoch's Company to Acquire Australian Press Agency, Get Big
Reuters Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News Corp., an international media
company controlled by publisher Rupert Murdoch, said Wednesday it
had arranged to buy nearly all the shares of Australian Associated
Press Pty.
   That company, which is no relation to the Associated Press in
the United States, distributes news and photographs throughout
Australia. It owns a 7.75 percent voting stake in Reuters Holdings
PLC, the large British news and information service.
   If Murdoch's acquisition succeeds, his company would become the
biggest single shareholder in Reuters because News Corp. already
owns a 6.8 percent voting stake in Reuters.
   News Corp., which had owned 44.65 percent of the Australian
Associated Press, said it had acquired another 8.3 percent from
Bell Group Ltd., a concern controlled by Australian investor Robert
Holmes a Court.
   News Corp. said it also had agreed to acquire a 44.65 percent
stake from John Fairfax Ltd., one of Australia's major media
companies.
   Prices weren't disclosed.
   Murdoch, a native Australian who became a U.S. citizen in 1985,
already controls about 60 percent of Australia's press and has
encountered government resistance to an expansion from government
antitrust officials.
   It was not immediately clear whether Murdoch's arrangement to
effectively acquire the Australian Associated Press would be
blocked by the government. But an official of the Trade Practices
Commission, which regulates such transactions, said it would
investigate.
   The official, who declined to be identified by name, said
elements of the sale appeared to conflict with an order issued last
year that prevented Murdoch from acquiring the parent company of
the Australian Associated Press, the Australian Associated Press
Information Services Ltd.

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge approved the A.H. Robins
Co.'s merger pact with American Home Products Corp. on Wednesday
after Robins agreed to put $100 million toward Dalkon Shield claims
before its Chapter 11 bankruptcy case is completed.
   U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr., who earlier in the
day had raised questions about the merger deal, signed an order to
execute the agreement in the wake of the pharmaceutical company's
offer, said Roscoe E. Puckett Jr., a Robins spokesman.
   The $100 million would cover administrative costs to set up a
Dalkon Shield trust fund that eventually will grow to $2.475
billion, the amount Merhige said is needed to pay claims against
the intrauterine birth-control device.
   The claims covered by the initial funding would be smaller
amounts to women who show minimal proof of Dalkon Shield use and
injury, said Puckett, the Robins spokesman.
   Earlier Wednesday, Merhige, citing years of delay in paying
Dalkon Shield claims, refused to ratify the merger unless it
allowed some compensation before the company's reorganization
became final.
   The surprise ruling sent attorneys in the 2{-year-old bankruptcy
case back to the drawing board to hammer out a compromise that
would allow payments of some claims pending expected appeals of the
reorganization.
   ``You know it's coming. I know it's coming,'' Merhige told the
attorneys of expected court challenges. ``But we can't wait any
longer.''
   Merhige's objection involved a section of the merger agreement
that would allow the New York-based American Home Products, which
plans to acquire Robins through a $700 million exchange of stock,
to back out after one year, if appeals of the court's confirmation
order for Robins' reorganization plan are still pending.
   Putting off payments of injury claims against the intrauterine
device until all appeals are resolved and a final order approving
the reorganization is entered would be unacceptable, the judge said.
   Instead, the judge suggested that American Home Products put up
$100 million to begin paying claims pendig appeal. If the
reorganization is later voided, he said, then AHP could recover the
money from Robins.
   ``I'm not going to delay this any more,'' he said. ``These women
have waited and waited and waited.''
   Under the agreement reached later Wednesday, Robins will put up
the $100 million instead of AHP, Puckett said.
   Until the hearing before Merhige and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Blackwell N. Shelley, there were no known hitches with the merger,
except for a $25 million breakup claim against Robins filed by the
Rorer Group Inc.
   Robins and Rorer, a suburban Philadelphia drug manufacturer, had
reached a tentative merger pact late last year. But in subsequent
talks involving Rorer, AHP and a third potential Robins' buyer,
France's Sanofi SA, officials of Robins accepted the American Home
offer.
   Merhige said he would conduct a hearing on the Rorer claim at a
later time.
   The American Home deal, reached Jan. 19, had been endorsed by
attorneys for 195,000 women with Dalkon Shield claims and by Robins
stockholders. In addition to the $2.475 billion Dalkon Shield trust
fund, Robins' trade creditors would receive full payment of claims.
   When the merger proposal came up in court, Robins' attorney
Dennis Drebsky said the plan ``happily is largely consensual.''
   But Merhige surprised attorneys by announcing, ``I have a
problem.''
   The judge said AHP's withdrawal option put an unnecessary delay
on paying claims unless the appeals court ordered a freeze on
payments pending a resolution of the case.
   Robins filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in August
1985 as millions of dollars in claims mounted against the Dalkon
Shield. The company distributed about 4.5 million of the IUDs in
the United States and abroad in the early 1970s.
   At the time it entered bankruptcy court, Robins had settled
9,500 of 15,000 Dalkon Shield lawsuits with payments of about $530
million. Injury claims have ranged from pelvic infections to
sterility.

<TEXT>
   The dollar firmed slightly against most major
currencies Wednesday, but traders remained cautious in advance of
new trade data to be released Thursday.
   Gold prices edged lower in domestic trading after climbing
overseas. Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at
$445 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $1 from late Tuesday.
   Analysts said the foreign-exchange markets remained relatively
quiet in anticipation of the government's January trade figures,
which are expected to show a small increase in the monthly trade
deficit.
   Although estimates have varied, most traders now expect the
deficit for January to total somewhere between $13 billion and $14
billion, compared with $12.2 billion in December.
   A figure at the low end of the range would be a boon to the U.S.
currency; a high-end number would revive the downward pressure on
the dollar, they said.
   The dollar has been pressured lower in the past by trade reports
showing a growing imbalance of imports over exports. But as recent
reports have shown improvement in the trade gap, the currency has
stabilized.
   In advance of the latest report, traders were reluctant ``to
step up and buy the dollar,'' according to Karen Gibbs of the
investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   The currency managed its slight gains in response to
better-than-expected government reports on housing construction and
industrial production. The Commerce Department said housing starts
jumped 8.9 percent in February, while the Federal Reserve said
output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2
percent during the month. Both appeared to be positive signs for
the U.S. economy.
   Because it is viewed as a safe haven in times of international
turmoil, the dollar also drew strength from reports of an attempted
coup in Panama and of a Nicaraguan attack on Contra rebels in
Honduras.
   In Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar rose 0.24 yen
to a closing 127.49. Later, in London, it was quoted at 127.37 yen.
In New York, the dollar traded at 127.455 yen, up from 127.375 late
Tuesday.
   In London, the British pound slipped to $1.8505, cheaper for

<HEAD>Oil Futures Move Higher on Panama Trouble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices spurted upward Wednesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, reponding to a drop in oil inventories and to
turmoil in Central America.
   On other markets, copper futures moved sharply higher; cattle
prices were a little higher while other livestock and meat
declined; grain and soybean prices retreated.
   Oil traders said an unsuccessful coup attempt in Panama against
the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega set the oil market on
edge.
   ``And there were rumors that workers on the Panama oil pipeline
went on strike,'' said Richard Kane, an analyst in New York with
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   The pipeline is the primary means of moving crude oil shipped
from Alaska across Panama to other tankers that take it to Gulf
Coast.
   There also were rumors that the Panama military cut off roads to
the U.S. military base in the Panama Canal Zone and fears that the
canal could be closed, Kane said.
   ``All this helped people to make up their minds to cover'' their
``short'' positions, Kane said.
   There has been an unusually large number of open contracts on
crude oil, with many traders having sold contracts with the idea of
buying them back later in hopes prices would fall in the interval _
a practice known as ``selling short.''
   Fearing the events in Panama could drive prices up instead, many
people who were short felt it was wise to buy now to offset their
earlier sales, Kane said.
   The reports out of Panama topped a market that opened bullish on
industry data released Tuesday.
   The American Petroleum Industry said crude oil, gasoline and
heating oil stocks were all down in the latest week. Gasoline was
down 3.59 million barrels from the previous week and heating oil
was reduced by 5.6 million barrels.
   ``These are very good product drawdowns,'' said Kane.
   Prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose 19 cents to 32
cents a barrel, with the contract for delivery in April settling at
$16. Heating oil was .43 cent to .66 cent higher, with April at
44.08 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .40 cent to .89
cent higher, with April at 45.24 cents a gallon.
   Copper futures rallied strongly after suffering sharp declines
the previous day on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   The recovery was triggered by a reversal in outlook for the size
of stockpiles in the exchange warehouses.
   ``The inventory expectations went from the plus side to the
minus side,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst in New York with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The expectations Wednesday, she said, was that there would be
further drawdowns in stocks.
   Trading of precious metals, meanwhile, was quiet as the market
awaited the government's report Thursday on the nation's foreign
trade balance during January.
   Copper settled .30 cent lower to 3.05 cents higher, with the May
contract at 97.55 cents a pound.
   Gold was $1 lower, with March at $445.30 a troy ounce; and
silver was 3.8 cents to 4 cents lower, with March at $6.327 a troy
ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures prices turned weaker on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Selling from South America put pressure on the soybean market
from the start, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with G.H. Miller & Co.
   This was compounded by industry data putting the amount of
soybeans processed in mills during February at 3.7 million tons,
substantially lower than a month earlier and the year-ago figure.
   The implication is that soybean processors still have large
supplies of beans.
   Gidel said the corn and wheat prices were depressed by a lack of
export interest.
   Wheat was 1{ cents to 2} cents lower, with March at $2.92{ a
bushel; corn was \ cent to 1\ cents lower, with March at $1.97{ a
bushel; oats were } cent lower to 1 cent higher, with March at
$1.89{ a bushel; and soybeans were 2\ cents to 4 cents lower, with
March at $6.11{ a bushel.
   Live cattle futures rallied to close a little higher, while
other livestock and meat were weaker at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Traders said a snowstorm in the Plains encouraged buying of
cattle futures.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .15 cent higher, with the
April contract at 73.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged
to .32 cent lower, with March at 82.40 cents a pound; live hogs
were unchanged to .30 cent lower, with April at 44.77 cents a
pound; and frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .25 cent lower,
with March at 52.50 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures moved higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 2.80 points higher at 268.80 points. The
underlying spot index gained 2.52 points, closing at 268.65.

   Financially troubled De Laurentiis
Entertainment Group Inc. said Tuesday it will sell the foreign
television, video and non-theatrical rights to virtually its entire
320-movie library for $69 million.
   The foreign rights are being acquired by a newly formed British
company controlled by financier Michael W. Stevens.
   Stevens also controls Parafrance Communications S.A. of Paris
which, through its Tele-Cip subsidiary, is the largest privately
owned television production concern in Europe.
   De Laurentiis still is seeking a buyer for the remaining rights
to its library and the sprawling Wilmington, N.C., studio where
most of its films are made.
   The company has been dogged by a string of box-office flops
since it went public three years ago.
   In first nine months of the company's past fiscal year, it took
$42.5 million in writeoffs on unsuccessful films. The company
posted a net loss for the three quarters of $36.2 million. Results
of the fiscal year ended Feb. 29 haven't been released.
   In mid-February, the company's founder, Italian filmmaker Dino
De Laurentiis, 68, stepped down as chairman and chief executive,
but he continues to own 60 percent of the company.

<TEXT>
   Henley Group Inc., a two-year-old
holding company, on Wednesday announced plans to split into two
public companies and buy back 22 percent of its stock.
   The stock buy-back would cost about $512 million at current
prices. Henley jumped $1.75 a share to close at $25.625 a share in
over-the-counter trading.
   Henley is an amalgam of 35 construction, environmental, energy,
chemcial, manufacturing and finance businesses spun off in April
1986 by Allied-Signal Inc., which itself was formed by a $5 billion
merger in 1985.
   Henley has gained a reputation for tightening operations to
boost profits in individual units and then taking those units
public. The current market value of Henley's investments in its
subsidiaries that have publicly traded shares and its other
long-term investment securities is $2 billion.
   In recent months Henley has been involved in a so-far
unsuccessful bid for Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., the
Chicago-based railroad, land and natural resources giant.
   Under the restructuring, which was approved in principle by the
company's board on Wednesday, Henley's assets would be divided
between two public companies:
   _Wheelabrator Group Inc., which already is publicly traded,
would take over Henley's stake in its successful Wheelabrator
Technologies Inc. subsidiary and other assets related to the
refuse-to-energy business.
   Wheelabrator Group would have the flexibility and resources to
speed up the expansion of its businesses through mergers,
acquisitions and joint ventures.
   _A newly created entity, to be called Henley Group Inc., would
own Signal Capital Corp., Signal Landmark Holdings Inc., Henley
Manufacturing Corp. and Henley's stake in Fisher Scientific Group
Inc., plus other assets.
   ``This program will enable our shareholders to participate
directly in Henley's $650 million investment in Wheelabrator
Technologies, the nation's leading refuse-to-energy business,''
said Michael Dingman, Henley's chairman and chief executive.
   Shares of the new entity that will be created for Henley's other
holdings will be distributed to stockholders as a partially taxable
special dividend, the company said.
   Henley's board also authorized the repurchase of 20 million of
the company's 90 million outstanding shares. The number of
outstanding shares peaked at 129 million in November 1986 before
the company initiated a series of stock buy-backs.
   After the buy-back is completed, Henley will have repurchased
nearly 43 percent of its stock.
   Separately, Henley said it decided to waive protection under a
recently enacted Delaware statute providing that a holder of 15
percent of a company's stock is prohibited from merging with the
company or undertaking certain other actions for three years.
   ``We do not believe it is in the best interests of shareholders
to impose these restrictions,'' Dingman said. ``We prefer to give
investors a free hand to make those decisions.''
   Henley's top management owns about 6.5 million of the company's
shares. That stake would rise to 9.3 percent with the completion of
the stock repurchase.
   Henley spokesman Norman Ritter said management wasn't
considering a bid to take the company private.
   Henley also said it intends to raise $1 billion by issuing
notes, then using the proceeds to pay off its current $980 million
in bank debt. That will allow the company to arrange $2.5 billion
in new bank credit, Henley said.

<HEAD>Avis Ends Five-Year Ban on Cornrows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAN GEHORSAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The car rental company Avis suddenly
reversed a five-year policy forbidding employees to wear cornrows
after two black workers filed a racial discrimination complaint
Tuesday.
   In a memorandum filed with the Philadelphia Commission on Human
Relations, longterm employees Linda Holman, 43, and Wanda Williams,
35, contended a ban against the small, tight braids injected
``racial considerations into the employment process.''
   They argued the ban targeted blacks because the hair style was
worn predominantly by blacks, often as an affirmation of their
African heritage.
   Just hours after the memorandum was filed by the American Civil
Liberties Union, the Avis headquarters in Garden City, N.Y.,
notified the Philadelphia branch the ban had been lifted.
   ``I am delighted that Avis is in fact trying harder,'' ACLU
attorney Stephan Presser said. ``The ... office tells me I am to
inform my clients that they are free to wear their cornrows proudly
to work tomorrow. This is the fastest victory I ever had in my
life. I'm just delighted. My clients won.''
   John Britton, a spokesman for Avis Rent A Car Systems Inc., said
the company was in the process of ``formalizing'' new standards
allowing cornrows before the employees' filed their complaint. The
new grooming guidelines will appear in a brochure that will be
issued to Avis' 1,400 national branches in May, he said.
   Cornrows were banned in a written circular in 1983 along with
``extreme'' bouffant hairdos and unkempt layered cuts.
   ``But things are modified, hairstyles are modified and attitudes
are modified,'' Britton said. ``In the '60s, we used to require
women behind the counter to wear girdles, and we had rules
governing hair length and facial hair. All those things have
changed over time.''
   When the ban was implemented, cornrows were not predominantly
considered a sign of black pride, he said.
   ``My first awareness of cornrows was with a (white) movie
actress, Bo Derek,'' he said.
   Avis reversed its position as part of an effort to respect
cultural differences, he said.
   According to Presser, Ms. Holman and Ms. Williams were warned
that they would be fired when they began wearing cornrows in July.
The rental agents wore wigs over the cornrows ``until they
literally became a headache'' and then gave up the hairstyle, he
said.
   Their memorandum charged that the ban on cornrows violated city,
state and federal job discrimination laws. Had the Philadelphia
Commission on Human Relations concurred, the agency could have
taken Avis to court, Presser said.
   Presser said he will wait a few weeks to see how the women fare
before withdrawing the charges.

<HEAD>FERC Says Construction Applications Involve 31 Projects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
decided Wednesday that 71 applications to construct new natural gas
pipelines serving the Northeast really amount to 31 projects, and
the staff has warned two that they are in danger of rejection
already.
   The analysis was necessary because a single project may require
more than one request to the commission to proceed. If a new
pipeline would use a segment of an existing line in the middle, it
might mean three applications _ one for the middle and one for each
end.
   The commission attracted the applications during an ``open
season'' ending in January for new pipeline applications to serve
New England, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where demand
for gas is rising.
   As is its custom, the commission declined to release immediately
the text of what it had voted on, but staff lawyer Susan Court told
reporters afterward the commission wanted public comment on its
analysis and how to proceed, and would request market data from the
applicants and schedule technical conferences in the next step.
   Chairman Martha Hesse told her four fellow commissioners she
would propose a schedule in the next few days.
   Without the text of what the commission voted, it was impossible
to tell which companies fell in what class. But the commission was
told in a staff briefing that of the 31 projects, 20 appear to be
competitive, requiring hearings comparing one proposal against
another.
   Court said later it was not clear yet whether all 20 would be in
one hearing, or whether separate competitions were involved and the
hearings could be held in groups, perhaps according to the market
that would be served.
   Seven projects have no competition and can proceed on their own,
and backers of four were sent ``deficiency letters,'' warning that
their applications were inadequate.
   Two of those letters went to ANR Corp., whose Erie subsidiary
has one project, and to Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., whose
Indiana-Ohio subsidiary has another.
   The two companies were among three applying for permission under
an optional procedure whereby the applicant assumes the economic
risk of building the line and is forbidden from spreading those
costs among other other lines and customers if its expectations
don't pan out.
   The commission, however, has limited such applications to
pipelines promising to transport gas for anybody _ and has denied
such applications from ``open access'' companies it judged mere
extensions of a ``closed'' company.
   That is the case with ANR and Panhandle, Court said.

<HEAD>Personnel Vice President Says Chrysler Plans Management
Streamlining</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER HILLS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. will try to meet
its foreign competition by trimming executive-suite jobs and
stepping up teamwork on the plant floor, a Chrysler vice president
said Tuesday.
   By year's end, the No. 3 automaker will begin cutting its
eight-level organizational chart to a six-tier plan similar to
Japanese auto company structures, said Anthony St. John, vice
president of human resources and Chrysler's chief labor negotiator.
   The company also plans a new dispute-resolution system for
management employees in addition to opening early negotiations with
the United Auto Workers union on a contract for some 60,000 union
employees.
   Contract talks could begin as early as the third week in April,
St. John said. The UAW agreed last week to Chrysler's request for
early negotiations on a contract to replace a three-year contract
expiring Sept. 14.
   St. John said Chrysler needs to find ways to inspire employee
commitment and loyalty while keeping the company's employment costs
at competitive levels.
   ``The outcome may well be determined by our ability to provide
meaningful assurances of employee security,'' St. John said at a
labor-management seminar at Oakland University's Ken Morris Labor
Studies Center.
   Chrysler's request for an early start of talks was part of an
effort to return to a teamwork labor-management approach, he said.
Talks normally begin in mid-July.
   Tension already is running high in response to Chrysler's
decision to close down operations in Kenosha, Wis., and its plan,
since reversed in the face of bitter UAW opposition, to sell its
Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary.
   ``Our goal is to reach a strike-free settlement,'' St. John
said. ``It is going to then put the adversarial action behind us.''
   Chrysler already has begun talks with the UAW on a contract
covering 800 employees who will continue engine assembly work at
Kenosha and a closing agreement to cover 5,500 employees losing
their jobs in assembly and stamping operations at the former
American Motors Corp. factory.
   In addition to the contract talks, St. John said, the company
will be attempting to negotiate additional modern operating
agreements such as those set up in six of its plants since 1985.
   The agreements involve a teamwork concept, also found in
Japanese auto plants, involving workers in decisions, cutting the
number of supervisors by about 30 percent, and eliminating
artificial barriers such as separate management dining rooms and
parking.
   ``It puts into practice the simple but long neglected truth that
people exist from their shoulders up as well as from their
shoulders down,'' St. John said.
   The 1985 contract established a six-member joint activities
board with three members each from the company and union. The board
has organized training to bring employees up to date in areas such
as computers, new technology, robotics.
   Training programs will be stepped up, along with such modern
operating agreement features such as higher pay for workers
mastering additional skills.
   ``Roughly 25 percent of our hourly work force is illiterate,''
St. John said.
   St. John did not say how many jobs would be involved in the
upper-level cuts, but said most are expected to be accomplished
through retirements and other normal departures.

<HEAD>Housing and Production Up, Markets Quiet Ahead of Trade Figures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Stronger industrial production and a rebound in housing
construction were reported by the government Wednesday, but the
financial markets had mixed reactions in advance of a more potent
statistic, the trade deficit.
   The Federal Reserve said industrial production edged up 0.2
percent in February despite output reductions at auto factories and
coal mines. Economists said the gain, although slower than the
January level, represented good news for the economy and further
dampened concerns about a severe slowdown.
   The Commerce Department said the housing industry, after
staggering for two months following the October stock crash,
enjoyed a sharp 8.9 percent increase in construction activity in
February, the biggest gain in more than a year.
   The department said the increase pushed construction of
single-family homes and apartments up to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.49 million units last month following declines of
15.8 percent in December and 1.9 percent in January.
   Those setbacks, coupled with three consecutive monthly declines
in new home sales, had raised concerns because housing is often the
first industry to weaken at the onset of a recession. Economists
feared that home buyers had grown wary following the record
collapse of the stock market in October.
   But the February upturn in construction starts was seen as an
encouraging sign that while housing activity will be slower this
year, it will not weaken so much that it threatens overall economic
growth.
   ``Housing is on the rebound,'' said Warren Lasko, executive vice
president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. ``With interest
rates at low levels and the economy growing and no recession in
sight, we think we have all the ingredients in place to generate a
strong spring building season.''
   Nevertheless, the news hurt the bond market, a barometer of
interest rates and the economy. Since stronger growth implies
future inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income
investments, bond prices tumbled.
   The Treasury's key 30-year issue fell $10 per $1,000 in face
amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, jumped from 8.51
percent to 8.60 percent, its highest level since late January.
   On the other hand, the stock market closed largely higher. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which sat for most of
the day with a modest loss, ended with a 16.91 point gain at
2,064.32, though trading was slow.
   Analysts said the markets remained preoccupied with what the
Commerce Department would report Thursday on the January trade
deficit. That monthly statistic has become one of the most
important influences because of its implications for American
monetary and trade policy.
   The deficit declined in November and December, suggesting that
the dollar's depreciation over the past two years has made American
products more competitive. Three straight monthly declines would
provide further confirmation of that trend and lessen pressure for
more devaluation of the U.S. currency.
   Conversely, if the deficit significantly widened in January, the
dollar likely would fall, raising fears of inflation and foreign
flight from U.S. investments.

   The U.S. Labor Department agreed Tuesday
to let some North and South Carolina school districts continue to
use 17-year-old bus drivers through the end of the school year.
   The agreement supersedes a Labor Department order that had
required both states to end the use of 17-year-old school bus
drivers by April 1.
   The department had told the two states it was ending an
exemption allowing the 17-year-old drivers because the states had
violated the terms of the exemption, primarily by using drivers who
had moving violations.
   Officials in both states had protested that some districts had
been unable to find qualified replacements, and that abruptly
replacing experienced 17-year-olds with new drivers could create
safety problems.
   Under the agreement announced by Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin,
school districts that have had the most problems finding new
drivers can use 17-year-old drivers through June 15, and all
districts may use drivers who will turn 18 before that time.
   All 17-year-old drivers must have been hired and trained before
the school year began and must have clean driving records, the
agreement said.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell called the compromise a
``fair agreement.''
   ``This agreement was essential to provide the safest possible
situation for our children for the remainder of the school year, as
well as prevent major disruptions in the 12 districts unable to
find qualified adults,'' Campbell said.
   ``The state of South Carolina will not seek another extension,''
Campbell said. ``We will have an all-adult force in place by the
beginning of the next school year.''
   Campbell and state Education Superintendent Charlie Williams
said they support state budget proposals that would raise minimum
bus driver pay from $3.47 to $4.75 an hour and fund some fringe
benefits.
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin said he would seek a $24 million
budget amendment during the June session of the General Assembly to
increase drivers' pay to enable the state to attract and hire
additional adult drivers. The state has 2,085 drivers under age 18,
officials said.
   ``During our discussions with Secretary McLaughlin, I think it
became apparent that our school children would be a lot safer
riding with 17-year-olds with seven or eight months of bus driving
experience than it would be to have them riding with drivers who
have little or no experience driving a school bus,'' Martin said.
   Williams said the agreement leaves South Carolina with about 350
adult positions to fill by next year. After beginning the year with
2,250 17-year-old drivers, the state now has 808 17-year-olds among
its 6,000 drivers, Deputy Superintendent of Education Carl Garris
said.
   The 17-year-olds have been permitted to drive in the two states
under an exemption to the Fair Labor Standards Act. But that was
repealed after Labor Department investigations during January and
February found North Carolina had violated the act 80 times, and
South Carolina had recorded 200 violations during the two-month
period.
   The investigation was triggered when a 4-year-old boy in West
Columbia was struck and killed by a 17-year-old bus driver with a
bad driving record.

   A federal judge Wednesday blocked a moved by an
Italian tire maker to stop an Ohio law from hampering its attempted
takeover of Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.
   U.S. District Judge Alice M. Batchelder ruled that the Ohio
Control Share Acquisition Act does not violate federal law by
discriminating against interstate commerce, or causing inconsistent
state regulation.
   The statute requires a corporate raider to wait up to 50 days
for shareholders to vote before purchasing tendered shares. Federal
law requires that any tender offer remain open for no less than 20
business days.
   Pirelli Societe Generale SA of Italy made a tender offer of $58
a share last week for Firestone, which has its corporate offices in
Chicago and its North American tire headquarters in Akron.
   The $1.9 billion offer is contingent on Firestone dropping its
plans to enter into a joint tire venture with Bridgestone Corp. of
Japan.
   Firestone officials said Pirelli's offer killed earlier plans to
sell most of the Firestone tire-making business to Bridgestone, but
the Firestone board met Monday and decided to explore other
options. Firestone said it is again talking with Bridgestone,
adding that the talks concern ``what course of action Bridgestone
may now wish to pursue.''
   The U.S. tire maker said it would advise shareholders by Friday
on the Pirelli offer.
   Firestone attorney Patrick F. McCarton opposed Pirelli's attempt
to win a preliminary injunction during a court hearing Monday,
saying ``Control is one of the most valuable assets a shareholder
can possess. It is a collective asset and should be (given up) in a
collective manner.''
   Dennis Orr, an attorney representing Pirelli-owned Veere Inc. of
Delaware, argued the law is a burden on interstate commerce and
could hurt shareholders by giving Firestone time to defeat
Pirelli's tender offer.
   Ms. Batchelder said it is possible for companies to comply with
both Ohio and federal law.
   ``The Ohio act ... by allowing the shareholders collectively to
evaluate the fairness of the tender offer and to vote as a group,
... furthers the policy of investor protection,'' Ms. Batchelder
wrote, in a 14-page opinion.
   The Ohio statute does not discriminate against interstate
commerce or cause inconsistent state regulation because it has the
same effects on raiders from inside and outside of Ohio, she said.

   Koppers Co. said Wednesday it was studying a
cash payout to shareholders, asset sales or a recapitalization plan
to battle a takeover attempt by a British investor and a New York
investment bank.
   Koppers did not disclose the options it was studying, but
investor Brian Beazer, who has joined with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in making the $45 a share, or $1.3 billion, takeover offer,
criticized the company's disclosure.
   Beazer said that if Koppers decided to undertake a
recapitalization, the case the company essentially was bidding for
itself. As such, Koppers was obligated to give Beazer's group
access to the same confidential corporate information Koppers would
use to formulate such a plan.
   ``You now have a duty to provide us with a `level playing
field,' to meet with us, and to furnish us with the same
information you would provide to potential lenders or investors in
any recapitalization or asset sale program that Koppers is
considering,'' Beazer said in a public letter issued Wednesday.
   In addition to disclosing possible alternatives to thwart
Beazer, Koppers likely will launch a publicity campaign criticizing
Shearson, according to one securities analyst.
   ``I would expect the first thing you'll see ... will be some
newspaper advertising that'll peel the hide off Shearson,'' said
Donald A. Pattison of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. of New York.
   Pattison said Shearson is vulnerable to criticism for owning 46
percent of BNS Inc., the company formed with Beazer to attempt the
takeover of the Pittsburgh building materials and chemical company.
   Shearson's equity participation is a more aggressive variation
of investment bankers' traditional role as adviser and financier in
hostile takeovers.
   Koppers alleged in a federal lawsuit filed March 11 that
Shearson violated disclosure requirements of securities laws and
that it offered to sell Koppers its services defending the company
against hostile takeovers after laying plans with Beazer to raid
the company.
   Pittsburgh filed suit in federal court Wednesday alleging that
Shearson, as underwriter of city bonds, violated its duty not to do
anything to hurt the Pittsburgh economy, said David Welty,
spokesman for Mayor Richard Caliguiri.
   Under Beazer's plan to sell Koppers' chemical business, about
1,100 jobs could disappear in Pittsburgh, city officials contend.
   Caliguiri also ordered city department heads to exclude Shearson
from consideration as an underwriter of future financing, Welty
said.
   A Koppers spokesman said the board set no timetable for settling
details of any recapitalization offer.
   ``The question is what's it worth'' to shareholders, said
securities analyst Gregory Drahuschak of Butcher & Singer of
Pittsburgh. ``Until that happens you wait around.
   Pattison said he expects Koppers to defeat the tender offer
through the lawsuit and an offer to common shareholders of cash and
securities worth up to $60.
   ``I don't see a third party out there that would be a competitor
to Beazer,'' said Drahuschak. ``I tried to find one and couldn't
even scare up a good rumor.''
   Pattison, however, said aggregates, the crushed stone used in
roadbeds and mixed with cement to make concrete, are tightly
controlled in Britain, enhancing interest in U.S. producers like
Koppers. The weak U.S. dollar and accounting rule differences in
Britain and the United States might also attract other bidders for
Koppers.
   ``Koppers' board believes that the company remaining independent
would, over the long term, be a superior alternative to accepting
the BNS offer,'' which is inadequate, the company said.
   Koppers common stock jumped $2.75 a share Tuesday to $54.50 on
the New York Stock Exchange, apparently in anticipation of
Wednesday's deadline for the company to respond to the tender
offer. The announcement sent the stock down 87{ cents to $53.62{
Wednesday in heavy trading.
   Koppers Chairman Charles R. Pullin said management will explore
the possible sale of an equity interest in all or part of the
construction materials and services business or portions of the
business and the proceeds used to sweeten the payments to common
shareholders.
   Beazer has said it probably would sell Koppers' chemicals
business if it gained control.
   The BNS offer of $107 for each preferred share is adequate,
Koppers said, while declining to advise holders whether to tender
their stock.
   Koppers said it is being advised by The First Boston Corp.
