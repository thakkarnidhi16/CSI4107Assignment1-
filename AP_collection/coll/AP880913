<HEAD>AP Board Approves 4.4 Percent Assessment Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of The Associated Press
approved unanimously a 1989 general assessment increase of 4.4
percent for newspaper and broadcast members.
   The increase takes effect Jan. 15, 1989, for AP's 1,463
newspaper and 5,700 broadcast members.
   William J. Keating, AP board chairman and chief executive
officer of the Detroit Newspaper Agency, noted that the increase
was below inflation estimates of 5 percent to 5.5 percent for next
year.
   ``The increase continues the recent trend of assessment
adjustments less than the general rate of inflation,'' he said
Tuesday.
   Keating said ``stringent cost controls and new revenues from
nonmember sources'' enabled the board to restrict the increase to
4.4 percent and still fund major service improvements now under way.
   Keating said the AP's proposed operating and capital budgets
were examined by the board on a detailed, line-by-line basis.
   The budgets provide for expansion of AP's news staff, mostly in
the United States, to help meet the needs of AP's 28 percent
increase in newspaper membership over the past five years, Keating
said.
   The budgets also provide support for the new high-speed
PhotoStream and GraphicsNet systems, as well as for total
replacement of editing systems in all domestic bureaus.
   The general assessment increase will be combined with the fifth
step of the phase-in of the circulation-based newspaper formula for
those not yet on card with the new formula, which was adopted in
1985. Changes in circulation will also be reflected in the new
assessment for each newspaper member.
   Each member will receive exact figures on the assessment change
in October, Keating said.

<HEAD>School Board President Says He Lies To Uncover Leaks</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout with mayor removing board president,
comments from Hollis new conference.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Kurt Schmoke removed the Baltimore School
Board president on Tuesday after he admitted lying to board members
as a way of finding out who leaks stories to the media.
   Meldon S. Hollis, who was appointed by the mayor to a one-year
term as board president in December, will remain on the board. The
mayor appoints the nine board members, who serve as volunteers.
   Hollis, an attorney, admitted earlier Tuesday that he used poor
judgment in planting three different versions of a story to track
down news leaks and said that he would resign if the mayor asked
him to.
   ``Whether or not I retain the public confidence ... is ... a
matter for the public to decide, for the mayor to decide and for
the school board to decide,'' Hollis said at a news conference
Tuesday afternoon.
   Schmoke called Hollis' actions ``a terrible mistake in
judgment.''
   ``My view is that the public can tolerate an official being
wrong on an issue,'' Schmoke said. ``What people generally find
intolerable is an official lying to them.''
   Tape recordings of Hollis's remarks Monday to the Foundation for
Community Unity in Service, a political club, show he said he
leaked false information to school board members ``to see if they
were lying to me.''
   ``I know who's doing the lying,'' he said in the speech. ``I
know who it is. I feed them the lies, then they run out and lie to
the press.''
   Hollis said Tuesday he could not recall using the word ``lie''
in describing the way he released information on how candidates for
school superintendent would be interviewed earlier this year.
   He said he believed leaks were undermining the selection
process, because some candidates threatened to withdraw if their
candidacies were made public.
   He said he had become a political target and the object of news
leaks because of his attempts to uncover favoritism in the awarding
of grants in the school system.
   Board member Edward J. Gutman said Tuesday that he was
bewildered by Hollis' remarks.
   ``I think there's something wrong with the man. I don't even
know what he's talking about,'' Gutman said. ``The whole thing is
getting uglier and uglier. We are trustees (with) the most
important responsibility in the city.''
   Some board members, Hollis said, ``walk out of meetings and tell
you we have a deal and then before I can get to my office the press
is calling me asking me `did you all decide so and so.'
   ``I know who they are. I know who is doing the leaking. I know
who is doing the lying. That's OK. It will be taken care of in
time,'' Hollis said.
   Hollis acknowledged dissension within the board. However, he
took issue with an article in Monday's editions of The (Baltimore)
Sun, which said the school board was in a revolt.
   Problems arose last spring between Hollis and board members when
they were prevented from participating in the selection of a new
school superintendent. Problems resurfaced in July when Hollis
decided to hire a new executive director and several board members
said they felt the full board should have voted on the post.

<HEAD>House Of Reptiles Will Be Limited To Four Snakes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT COQUITLAM, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new law prompted by
Larry Moore's slithering, squeaking menagerie is forcing him to get
rid of 146 of his snakes.
   Responding to neighbors' complaints about living next door to a
house filled with 150 snakes _ and several hundred rats and mice
needed to feed them _ the municipal council voted Monday to limit
to four the number of snakes or rodents in a household.
   ``They don't belong in a residential neighborhood; in an urban
setting, 150 of anything is too much,'' said Alderman John Keryluk.
``I wouldn't want to live next door to a house where I know there
are snakes or rodents in large numbers.''
   Keryluk, co-chairman of the council committee that proposed the
bylaw amendment, said Moore keeps his reptiles and rodents in cages.
   ``The concern in the neighborhood is about the rodents or the
snakes breaking loose,'' he said. ``What if an uncaring person were
to break into his house and kick some of the cages apart?''
   Alf Miller, who lives across the street from Moore, said he
complained about the snakes 2{ years ago after he found one in his
yard.
   ``It was over 6 feet long and had a head about the size of an
orange,'' Miller said. ``It was sunning itself half on the wall of
my patio and half on the ground.''
   Moore has a large variety of snakes, but Keryluk said he
believes none is venomous.
   Moore did not return messages left on his home answering machine.
   The amendment to the animal regulation bylaw, which excludes pet
stores and schools, also prohibits venomous snakes.

   Graeber and others hook pilots and engineers to monitors while
they fly. They hope to see whether crew members make more mistakes
when such physical signs as body temperature and heartbeat suggest
they are less alert.
   Much of that data is still being collected and analyzed. But
Graeber said it's clear that by the third night of such schedules
as the San Francisco-London-Seattle tour, the cockpit crew becomes
increasingly lethargic.
   Dr. Mary Carskadon of Brown University has shown in the
laboratory what Graeber sees in the cockpit: The effects of lost
sleep accumulate over time.
   ``Most people, particularly those who are trained as pilots are,
can cope with the effects of chronic sleep deprivation fairly well
most of the time,'' she said. ``But ... a vulnerability is set up
that puts them at risk for catastrophic events to occur.''
   Experts say that when people are tired, they become sloppy.
Motivation flags, inertia sets in. They take short-cuts and ignore
small details.
   Flying a big plane, however, is mostly a matter of paying
attention to small details _ setting instruments, following
checklists, getting weather reports, watching dials.
   ``It's the errors of omission that occur because of lapses in
attention that are the hallmark of fatigue-related accidents,''
said Dr. Charles Czeisler of Harvard Medical School. Such omissions
would include not ``noticing an indicator that's not right,
anticipating a problem before it occurs, thinking many steps down
the line,'' he said.
   Sometimes pilots and flight engineers fall asleep. On long
cruises, especially over oceans, this is not terribly dangerous as
long as someone in the cockpit stays awake. But sleep is
contagious. The sleep experts say their research has turned up many
tales of entire crews nodding off.
   Another concern is micro-sleep, a shadowy state in which people
are half asleep. With the brain waves of sleep intruding on those
of wakefulness, people in this condition can continue to perform
duties while only vaguely aware of what's going on around them.
   ``It's much worse than being, frankly, fully asleep, because
they can continue to carry out routine tasks,'' said Czeisler. ``If
they were truly asleep, someone else at least might notice.''
   These problems occur, in part, because jet travel ignores the
circadian timekeeper, the product of millions of years of evolution
on a planet rotating once each 24 hours. Each day, the clock
oversees a symphony of changes in body temperature, alertness and
hormonal secretions, all of them geared to roughly a 24-hour cycle.
   For most people, the daily swing reaches its low point from 3:30
to 5 a.m. This is when they are sleepiest. There is another, less
pronounced, valley of drowsiness in the afternoon from 4 to 5. The
body temperature is also lowest at these times.
   Consider the pilot who leaves California on a late-night,
cross-country flight. Even if he slept during the day, he's likely
to feel sleepy early in the morning as his body temperature falls.
By the time he checks into a New York hotel, his body temperature
is rising again _ his body clock is telling him to wake up. Even
though he is tired, sleep is difficult. He awakens feeling ragged
and has to fly again.
   ``The pilot who flies across multiple time zones faces the
problem that his body continues at the old time zone,'' said
Dinges. ``He is forced to try to sleep when his body clock wants
him to be awake and to be awake when his body clock wants him to
sleep.''

<HEAD>Meese Attorney Says Ethics Office Impugns Former Attorney General</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for Edwin Meese III says the former
attorney general's reputation has been impugned unfairly by a
Government Ethics Office memorandum on Meese that declares that
``simply avoiding criminal conduct is not the mark of public
service.''
   Ethics office director Frank Nebeker said Monday that Meese
failed to meet federal ethics requirements by hanging onto $14,000
in telephone stock and by assisting longtime friend E. Robert
Wallach.
   Nebeker's based his memo on the results of a criminal
investigation completed this summer by independent counsel James
McKay. Although McKay declined to prosecute Meese, he concluded
that Meese probably broke federal conflict-of-interest laws twice
by handling matters affecting the telecommunications industry at
the time he held the phone stock.
   Meese declared he had been vindicated because he had not been
prosecuted.
   But Nebeker said: ``A major purpose of this memorandum is to
remind and inform that simply avoiding criminal conduct is not the
mark of public service.''
   The critique was sent to ethics officers in the federal
government.
   James Rocap, a lawyer for Meese, said in a statement: ``We are
dismayed'' by Nebeker's memo, that Meese's ``integrity and
reputation have been unfairly impugned.''
   Rocap said Nebeker ``apparently read the McKay report,'' but not
the rebuttal to it filed by Meese's lawyers. In it, they said
Meese's behavior had met the highest ethical standards.
   Rocap also said Nebeker had rejected a request to meet with
Meese's attorneys.
   A letter last Wednesday from Nebeker to Meese's lawyers said the
findings would be based on ``undisputed facts'' and that the
request for a meeting was therefore being denied.
   Nebeker said Meese also may have violated a presidential
executive order on ethics and accompanying regulations, a question
under review by the Justice Department's office of public
responsibility.
   The executive order says federal employees should avoid any
action which might create the appearance of, among other things,
using public office for private gain, giving preferential treatment
or adversely affecting the confidence of the public in the
integrity of government.
   ``There is no more clarion standard ... than that which exhorts
an employee to avoid any action that adversely affects the
confidence of the public in the integrity of the government,''
Nebeker said. ``While Mr. Meese's personal reputation could not but
have suffered as a result of this investigation, the public's
confidence in the Department of Justice has also suffered. One need
only look at the well-publicized personnel resignations in the
department to see why this standard is at issue.''
   Concerned over the impact Meese's continued tenure was having on
the Justice Department, former Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns
and criminal division chief William Weld resigned in protest in
March.
   Nebeker noted that Meese promised in 1985 when he became
attorney general to sell the phone stock because it presented a
potential conflict of interest. Meese listed the stock on
subsequent financial disclosure forms as having been sold.
   In reality, Meese, without informing the Senate or the ethics
office, transferred the stock to his financial manager, W. Franklyn
Chinn, who is under indictment along with Wallach, a San Francisco
attorney, on charges of racketeering in the Wedtech scandal. Meese
finally retrieved the stock and sold it last year after he came
under criminal investigation.
   In addition, Meese's agreement with the ethics office stipulated
that he would remove himself temporarily from any matter involving
Wallach, a longtime friend of the attorney general who had
represented him in an independent counsel's investigation in 1984.
Wallach was owed legal fees as a result.
   But during the period Meese had agreed to recuse himself from
involvement with matters concerning Wallach, Meese telephoned
then-national security adviser Robert McFarlane to arrange a
meeting for Wallach in connection with a proposed $1 billion Iraqi
oil pipeline.
   ``This office did not accept Mr. Meese's ethics agreement
lightly, does not accept his failure to comply with it lightly and
will not accept other nominees' agreements lightly in the future,''
Nebeker's memo said. ``These agreements serve an important purpose
not only for the individual involved but for the public. This
investigation of Mr. Meese is a stark example of the results of
inattention to such an agreement by an official.''

   Today's federal rules for pilot rest and duty hours come out of
the era of the DC-3, when propeller-driven airliners droned along
at speeds less than 200 mph and took eight hours to fly from New
York to Miami.
   Revised in 1964 and again in 1985, many of the Federal Air
Regulations differ little from rules first issued in the 1930s.
   Crews for large airlines on domestic routes can't be scheduled
to fly longer than eight hours between required rest periods. They
can't fly more than 30 hours in seven days; 100 hours a month and
1,000 hours a year. Crews may exceed the eight-hour limit if their
scheduled flights are delayed by weather, traffic or equipment
problems.
   Commuter airline pilots may fly 34 hours in 7 days; 120 hours in
a month and 1,200 a year.
   Crews must be given at least nine hours' rest in a 24-hour
period. However, that can be cut to eight hours if the next rest
period is increased by two to three hours, based on an FAA formula.
   Three-member international crews can fly up to 12 hours a day;
they must get 18 hours' rest if they fly more than 24 hours in 72
hours or 20 hours within 48 hours. Larger crews can fly longer;
two-member crews can fly only eight hours between rest periods.
   However, the rules don't speak to duty hours _ measured from the
time a pilot reports to the airport, usually an hour before first
takeoff, through the day's schedule including sitting on the ground
between flights, to departure after the final flight. Such
reckoning can stretch a crew's time on the job to 16 hours.
   West Germany, Britain and the Netherlands limit their pilots'
hours by calculating duty time, the number of takeoffs and
landings, the time of day and the number of time zones crossed.
   None of these factors is considered under U.S. commercial
regulations.
   The latest FAA rules are the result of so-called ``regulation by
negotiation.'' Union and airline representatives met in 1983-84
with FAA officials and a mediator to work out minor changes in
domestic rules.
   These rules are often used by airlines and their unions as a
baseline for schedules stricter than government guidelines.
   ``Our own rules go on beyond the FAR (federal air
regulations),'' said George Hof, head of American Airlines flight
operations. ``We find the FAR is a place to begin.''
   FAA administrator T. Allan McArtor strongly denies federal
regulations run second in safety to union contracts.
   ``Our standard is not the thinnest ice you can skate on,'' he
said.
   Yet in 1975 an FAA investigation of a series of Pan American
crashes in the Pacific raised questions about the adequacy of FAA
regulations.
   Dr. Stanley Mohler, then chief of the FAA's Aeromedical
Applications Division, suggested U.S. regulators look to the
factors that the Europeans use to set flying limits.
   ``It was the feeling at the FAA to leave it up to the unions to
negotiate relative to their airlines' specific type of flying,''
said Mohler, now head of aerospace medicine at Wright State
University. ``It seemed to make sense, up until deregulation.''
   With deregulation, airlines stretched into new markets, added
new routes and faced new competition. Efforts to cut costs and keep
fares low put pressure on various parts of the industry, including
the pilots. According to the Airline Pilots Association, the
average pilot flies 13 percent more each month today than 10 years
ago.
   McArtor says he has an open mind to change. The FAA is
supporting fatigue research being done by NASA on several airlines.
   ``I don't know of any carrier that won't voluntarily do all they
can to ensure efficiency in the cockpit,'' he said. ``But I don't
believe we know all that we will know about this phenomenon. As we
understand it better, the scheduling, I think, will reflect that.''

<HEAD>Consumer Group Attacks Proposed Change on Hot Dog, Sausage
Labeling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group says it will fight to retain
federal rules requiring food processors to acknowledge when finely
ground bone is used in hot dogs, sausage and other meat products.
   Rodney E. Leonard, executive director of Community Nutrition
Institute, decried an Agriculture Department proposal issued Monday
that would require that such ingredients as ground bone be included
on package labeling only when the material exceeds 10 percent of
the meat portion of the finished product.
   Under current regulations, so-called mechanically separated meat
or MSM can comprise up to 20 percent of the meat portion of certain
products, which include hot dogs, luncheon meats, sausage,
scrapple, canned spaghetti with meat sauce and other items. But
labels must state that the product contains MSM.
   The department said that if the new proposal is adopted, MSM
used in meat and poultry products ``would not have to be listed in
the ingredients statement on the label as long as it does not
exceed 10 percent of the meat and poultry portion of the finished
product.''
   Leonard said the proposed rule change was ``politically
motivated'' by the outgoing Reagan administration, which he said
could have made the proposal long ago.
   ``They want to get all of the junk and crud and sleaze done
before they leave (office),'' Leonard said. He said his
Washington-based consumer group would challenge the proposal during
the USDA hearing process.
   MSM is produced by putting the bones and attached meat remnants
of a slaughtered animal through a grinder and forcing the mixture
through sieves. Although most of the bone is strained out, some
small particles _ about the size of black pepper flakes _ wind up
with the salvaged meat in the final mixture.
   Mechanically deboned meat has been approved for use in certain
foods since 1978. However, the industry complained that the
stricter initial regulations called too much attention to the
finely ground bone, and the product failed to gain widespread use.
   Department officials said the proposal to allow up to 10 percent
MSM in products without labeling ``reflects a petition submitted to
USDA'' by four processors: Bob Evans Farms Inc., Columbus, Ohio;
Odom Sausage Co., Madison, Tenn.; Sara Lee Corp., Memphis, Tenn.;
and Owen Country Sausage Inc., Richardson, Texas.
   The proposed change in regulations will be open for public
comment until Nov. 8. Those can be sent to: Policy Office, Attn:
Linda Carey, Hearing Clerk, Food Safety and Inspection Service,
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 3171-S, Washington, D.C.

   An unlikely coalition of wealthy
housewives and cattlemen is spearheading opposition to Mexico's
first nuclear power plant.
   The plant, Laguna Verde, has been a pet project of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party for more than 20 years.
   But the party, which lost ground to the opposition in the July 6
general election, announced soon afterward that it was delaying the
plant's startup.
   ``After July 6, nothing is the same,'' said Rebecca Labastida, a
founder of the Mothers of Veracruz Anti-nuclear Committee, one of
several groups that have been working to get the plant mothballed
or converted to non-nuclear fuel.
   The coalition of urban housewives and cattle ranchers fighting
the project includes members of the governing party.
   ``A social consciousness is growing in Mexico. One point is
nuclear energy,'' said regional planner Tomas Berlin, who just
finished a book critical of Laguna Verde. ``In it you will see a
new face of Mexico.''
   Many residents in Xalapa, 140 miles east of Mexico City, oppose
the plant, which is located 40 miles outside the city on a winding
road dotted with roadside stands laden with local honey, cheese and
fruit.
   Thick stands of sugar cane carpet the steamy coastal plain where
white power pylons march down to the Gulf of Mexico and the green
lagoon that gave its name to Mexico's first nuclear plant.
   Inside the 13-story Unit One containment building, uranium fuel
rods wait in a dry concrete pool next to 657-megawatt reactor from
the United States.
   The men who are building the plant say they are confident of its
safety and are ready to turn on the first of two reactors.
   ``The first unit is ready. It's a political decision now,''
project spokesman Hector Luna Lastra said recently.
   Critics say the reactor, made by the U.S.-based General Electric
Co., and its containment building are dangerous and obsolete.
   The William H. Zimmer plant in Ohio, which had a reactor of the
same design, is being converted to coal fuel. The owners sued,
alleging the reactor design was flawed, and won an out-of-court
settlement of more than $78 millon.
   The Union of Concerned Scientists says all similar plants should
be phased out because the containment building could leak
radioactive materials.
   ``The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has concluded there is a 90
percent chance that it (the containment building) will break if
there is a meltdown,'' Robert Pollard, a nuclear safety engineer,
said from Washington.
   Laguna Verde is all that is left of a grand plan for a
nationwide network of 20 nuclear plants. The idea died when oil
prices plunged, but Laguna Verde lived on, despite a price tag that
rose from $263 million to $3.5 billion.
   The project was announced in 1968. Construction began in 1973,
and for years the project moved quietly along, providing thousands
of jobs.
   Opposition to Laguna Verde began in April 1986 after the nuclear
accident at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union, said Patricia Ortega,
another founder of Mothers of Veracruz. The explosion and fire at
the Soviet plant killed 31 people and sent a cloud of radiation
around the world.
   The Federal Electricity Commission countered criticism of
Lagunda Verde with a public relations campaign, but the opposition
kept growing.
   Mothers of Veracruz turned a group of traditional Mexican
housewives into a feisty band of activists that sent telegrams to
public officials, organized phone banks and printed booklets about
nuclear energy.
   ``Waking people up, waking people up. That's been the hardest
thing. To make them realize you can do something,'' Mrs. Labastida
said.
   Local cattlemen joined in, some even offering to help pay to
turn Laguna Verde into a non-nuclear plant. Last year, cattlemen
and housewives blocked traffic by linking arms across the road
leading to the plant.
   The plant has two reactors, one ready to be started up. The
governing party didn't say how long it would delay that procedure.

   The United States should develop new proposals
for U.S.-Soviet conventional arms control talks in case Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev succeeds in cutting back on military
spending, says a key congressman.
   The plans should be prepared even though there's no indication
Gorbachev has yet been successful, said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   ``A central element of Gorbachev's `new thinking' is that the
Western threat can be reduced by political means _ that is, arms
control _ which then reduces Soviet defense requirements,'' the
report said.
   ``For Gorbachev, arms control can cut the size of the Western
threat and a revised military doctrine can scale back the
military's response to that threat,'' it said.
   The panel's defense policy subcommittee concluded Monday that
``to date, there have been no significant, identifiable changes
traceable to Gorbachev's drive to scale back defense spending.''
   The study by the Democratic-run panel was based on a series of
hearings, including testimony from the CIA, Defense Intelligence
Agency, and other experts in government and private industry.
   Republican members of the panel issued a dissent, disputing the
majority's implication that the Soviets may be moving away from
what the GOP legislators said is a drive to achieve nuclear
superiority over the West.
   Gorbachev has called for economic and military reforms aimed at
shifting more spending into consumer goods and away from the huge
Soviet military structure, Aspin noted.
   ``Gorbachev's reform agenda for the military is driven primarily
by domestic concerns, not military or strategic factors,'' the
study said. ``The equation is simple: In order for his economic
reforms to succeed, Gorbachev must shift resources from the defense
sector to civilian use.''
   The current five-year plan began in 1986 and was developed
before Gorbachev took power in March 1985, Aspin said at a news
conference. Some changes may be seen in the Soviets' next five-year
plan, he said.
   ``There is a growing consensus among the experts that Gorbachev
intends to shift some of the Soviet Union's economic capacity from
military to civilian use,'' said Aspin.
   ``What the United States ought to be doing is probing. ... We
should move cautiously and carefully, but we should move,'' he
said. ``We need some concrete proposals in conventional arms.''
   He was referring to the long-stalled talks aimed at reducing
non-nuclear weapons and troops in Europe.
   The upcoming ``year we're looking at is a critical year,'' Aspin
said. ``It's too bad the United States is in transition.''
   As the Reagan administration winds down, no new proposals are
likely. In addition, a new administration will take six to eight
months to prepare its plans, no matter whether Republican George
Bush or Democrat Michael Dukakis is elected president, Aspin said.
   U.S. officials have a difficult time estimating Soviet military
spending, since the Soviets don't publish details about their
programs.
   The Soviets appear to be spending about 18 percent of their
gross national product on defense, compared to about 6 percent for
the United States, the study said. But the U.S. GNP is much larger.
   Soviet military spending increased about 2 percent annually in
the decade before Gorbachev took power, and has increased about 3
percent in each of the past two years.
   The study cited the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF)
treaty, which includes strict verification procedures and bigger
cuts in the Soviet arsenal than in the U.S. stockpile of weapons.
   The GOP minority, led by Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., the
ranking Republican on the committee, criticized part of the report.
   ``This report accepts, without the slightest qualification, the
idea that the Soviet leadership has accepted the implications of
nuclear parity _ implicitly meaning that the Soviets reject the
concepts of superiority, pre-emption, first use and victory,'' the
GOP members said.
   ``The apparent justification underlying this assumption appears
to be a decade of both Soviet public statements and arms control
activities. However, neither can be taken at face value as evidence
of a meaningful transformation in Soviet nuclear doctrine,'' the
dissent said.

<DATELINE>BANCHHARAMPUR, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the past two weeks, the
15,000 people of this town have been living in flood waters.
   They say they have received almost no help from the government,
although the town is only 25 miles east of Dhaka, the capital.
   Even in normal times, Banchharampur is isolated, like thousands
of other towns and villages in this country that is now
three-quarters submerged by overflowing rivers.
   There are no roads connecting the town to the outside world. The
trip from Dhaka takes five hours by motorboat across winding rivers
and through inundated rice paddies.
   Most people in Banchharampur are weavers or landless farmers who
have not been able to work since the flood waters from the Titash
River reached their houses Aug. 29.
   Firoz, who delivers goods from the market when it isn't flooded,
and his wife Hana, said they tried to get medical help for their
7-year-old daughter Rahima, who had a fever.
   ``Government medical workers came here once, but the crowd was
too big and they left before we could see them,'' Firoz said.
Townspeople said eight people drowned or died of diarrhea or
dysentery caused by drinking contaminated water. He said his family
had received 4.4 pounds of free rie from the government, and had to
borrow money from other villagers to buy more. A grain seller named
Farid said he had only two baskets of low-quality rice to sell.
   The government and foreign relief agencies are struggling to
reach millions of marooned flood victims by helicopter and boat.
But with at least 65,000 villages spread across 55,000 square miles
_ an area the size of Wisconsin _ the task is slow.
   On Sunday, fresh vegetables reached Banchharampur by boat from
unsubmerged fields 12 miles away, but the prices had soared by as
much as 175 percent since the floods began June 13.
   Sattar, his wife Alia and their three children normally eat 4.4
pounds of rice a day. Since the flood, the family has been getting
by on 2.2 pounds or less of rice a day, Alia said. She uncovered a
tin cooking pot, displaying an inch of rice in the bottom.
   ``This is all we have left. We have no more money,'' she said,
speaking in Bengali through an interpreter.
   The family has purchased rice with Sattar's last earnings as a
porter, and money from the family's only salable item _ a chicken
Alia managed to save when they abandoned their straw house, where
the flood water has reached the roof.
   ``We stayed in our house until the water got as high as
Saliha,'' Alia said, drawing her oldest child close to her.
   Saliha, wearing only a pair of cotton shorts and a jewelry stud
in her nostril, stood about three feet tall. Alia _ who like many
Bangladeshis doesn't have a family name _ said she did not know her
daughter's age, but the girl appeared to be about 10.
   Alia said her family took refuge with 20 other people in one
room of a hostel built for college students, where the water was 18
inches deep. The families piled wooden benches on top of each other
in two tiers, creating a wobbly wooden platform above the water.
   The highest path through the village is a foot under water. Some
people are living in houses where women wade waist-deep in water to
cook food on boards propped just above the water.
   But life in the village went on. The government-run bank was
open, although the few customers stood ankle-deep in water. At the
deed registry office, clerks sat on platforms above the water with
a black goat tethered in their midst.

<HEAD>Even Without Biaggi, Congressional Office Carries On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the Capitol Hill office for New York's 19th
Congressional District, phones still ring, mail comes in, letters
go out.
   The only thing missing is a member of Congress.
   Until Aug. 5, the district was represented by Rep. Mario Biaggi,
a Democrat who for nearly 20 years represented the East Bronx and
part of Yonkers. Biaggi, who was convicted of racketeering last
month in the Wedtech trial, resigned rather than face almost
certain expulsion by his colleagues.
   But even without an elected representative, the work of the
congressional office goes on. House rules provide for keeping
offices running in the event that a member resigns, dies or is
expelled.
   Constituents still get some services; what they don't get is
their own advocate who can sponsor and vote on legislation and
perform work in committees.
   In the case of Biaggi's constituents, they lost their voice in
Congress last year when Biaggi agreed to stop voting on the House
floor after being indicted for accepting illegal paid vacations. He
later was convicted of that charge in a separate trial.
   Deputy Clerk W. Raymond Colley said that when a vacancy occurs
in the House, ``The clerk of the House becomes in effect the
supervisor or manager of the vacant offices until a successor is
elected.''
   The clerk usually selects one of the former House member's
senior staffers to run the office, Colley said. Robert Blancato,
Biaggi's longtime administrative assistant, was appointed to run
the office upon the congressman's departure.
   ``We are carrying on the way that not only Mario Biaggi would
expect of his staff and the years of experience that we have, but
also using our own standards of what we believe we should do,''
Blancato said.
   Blancato said he still talks daily to Biaggi, who has returned
to the Bronx, and that the business of the congressional office
inevitably comes up.
   ``I don't know if there are rules about discussing business,''
Blancato said. ``... His advice and guidance and counsel, do I
still need it for what I do everyday? Absolutely, sure.''
   Colley said such communications are to be expected, and voiced
confidence that Blancato ``understands his role and what he's
doing.''
   Blancato said he has no sense of role reversal during
conversations with Biaggi.
   ``Every time I speak to him ... in a philosophical way, even if
it isn't in a literal way, I'm stll speaking to my boss,'' he said.
   Even the hurdle of sponsoring legislation is not insurmountable
without an elected representative. If the appointed administrator
believes some problem requires legislation, ``He can talk to the
other members of the delegation from that particular state and ask
them to support the issue,'' Colley said.
   ``These are not unusual situations,'' Colley said. ``We have had
vacancies for various reasons over the years.''
   Ten seats, including one belonging to the delegate from American
Samoa, have been vacated since the 100th Congress began almost two
years ago, Colley said. Most of those seats have been filled
through special elections.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo has called no special election to fill
Biaggi's seat, so whoever is elected on Nov. 8 won't begin serving
until January 1989.
   Chances are good that Biaggi will be re-elected to the seat he
vacated, but he has said he would not serve. If he wins, it is
expected that he would quit again and a special election would be
held.

<HEAD>USDA Estimates Show Huge Losses In June, July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The huge losses to 1988 harvests came mostly
in June and July, when drought and searing heat shriveled corn and
soybean yields across much of the nation, new Agriculture
Department estimates show.
   Assistant Secretary Ewen M. Wilson, the department's chief
economist, said total grain production this year is expected to
drop to 191 million metric tons, down 31 percent from 1987.
   Total supplies of grain for 1988-89, which include inventories
at the beginning of the season, are forecast at 366 million tons,
down 24 percent from last year.
   Wilson said at a news conference Monday that ``crop development
now has progressed to the point where production can be forecast
with a reasonable degree of confidence.''
   The corn yield, for example, was estimated at 78.5 bushels per
harvested acre, down from 119.4 bushels last year, the largest
drought-induced reduction in yield on record, he said.
   From 1965 to 1987, the September estimate overstated corn
production on nine occasions and understated it on 14 occasions,
Wilson said. In the case of soybeans, the September estimate
overshot final production in 12 years and understated it in 11.
   Wilson said rainfall in the last month ``has improved the
conditions of pastures and ranges, although more precipitation is
needed to restore them to normal.''
   Wilson said he is holding to an earlier prediction that consumer
food prices will go up an average of 3 percent to 5 percent this
year, with about 1 percent of the rise caused by drought. A further
increase is expected in 1989.
   The new USDA estimates showed the corn harvest, which is under
way, is expected to be at a five-year low of 4.46 billion bushels,
down 37 percent from 7.06 billion bushels harvested in 1987. Even
so, that was down by less than 1 percent from the forecast a month
ago.
   In May and June, before the drought tightened its grip, USDA
projected the corn harvest at 7.3 billion bushels, based on trends
and an assumption of normal weather.
   Those projections were revised downward in July to 5.2 billion
bushels, assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder of the
season. In August, the forecast was lowered to 4.48 billion
bushels, the smallest harvest since 1983, when drought and federal
acreage curbs reduced output to 4.17 billion bushels.
   The soybean harvest was estimated at a 12-year low of 1.47
billion bushels, down 23 percent from 1.9 billion bushels produced
last year but virtually unchanged from the August forecast.
Estimates last spring called for about 1.88 billion bushels, and
the July projection was 1.65 billion bushels.
   Production of all wheat was projected at 1.81 billion bushels,
down 14 percent from 2.1 billion produced in 1987 and 1 percent
below the August forecast.
   In May and June, USDA forecast this year's wheat output would be
up slightly. The July projection was 1.84 billion bushels, and the
August forecast was 1.82 billion bushels.
   Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American
farmers and, as a feed ingredient, is essential to the production
of meat, poultry and dairy products.
   Soybeans, which provide high-protein meal and quality vegetable
oil used in food processing, also are vital to U.S. food production.
   No new estimate of winter wheat production was included. Last
month's forecast, which was carried forward into the September
report, was 1.55 billion bushels, down 1 percent from last year.
   New estimates for spring planted wheat included durum, 49.2
million bushels, down 47 percent from 1987 production and the
smallest harvest since 1961. The new estimate was also down 10
percent from August.
   Other spring wheat was estimated at 206 million bushels, down 54
percent from last year and 3 percent below the August forecast.
   Cotton production was estimated at 14.7 million bales, down 2
percent from August but only slightly below the 1987 crop. The crop
was projected at 13.7 million bales in July.
   Overall, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said
U.S. crop production this year is expected to drop to 88 percent of
a 1977 base used as a comparison. That would be the lowest since
1983.
   Crop production last year averaged 106 percent of the base year.
The record was 117 percent reached in 1985, 1982 and 1981.

<HEAD>Inspector Says Rowan Violated Weapons Law</HEAD>

   A District of Columbia police inspector
testified that syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan broke a local gun
control law when he fired on a backyard intruder in June.
   Following a pre-trial hearing Monday that included testimony
from police Inspector James R. Lee, D.C. Superior Court Judge
Arthur Burnett said he would rule by Friday on a motion that
weapons charges against Rowan be dismissed.
   Rowan, 63, has been charged with using an unregistered revolver
to wound a teen-ager who was intruding in the backyard of his home.
He also has been charged with unlawful possession of ammunition for
the handgun.
   Rowan, who has written and spoken frequently on behalf of gun
control, maintains that his son, Carl Jr., a former FBI agent, was
told by city officials he was not required to register the weapon
used in the June 14 shooting.
   Rowan testified that he had complained repeatedly to police
about trespassers and said that death threats heightened his
concern over intruders.
   The columnist, who contends the police knew he had a gun, said
he had warned a police officer that if anyone ever confronted him
on his property late at night, he would have to shoot them and he
didn't want to do that.
   The officer, Jasper L. Chatman, contradicted Rowan's testimony,
saying, ``He never made a statement to me about any action he was
going to take.'' Chatman said he'd been to the Rowan house between
10 and 20 times in the last few years, all on complaints about
trespassers using the pool.
   Lee, who has worked in the district's gun records division since
1976, said Rowan had broken the law that prohibits anyone but the
registered owner from using a weapon.
   He acknowledged that city police officers and federal law
enforcement agents are not required to register weapons, but he
insisted that only those individuals are allowed to use the weapons.
   Lee added that it is a violation of law for other family members
even to touch an agent's weapon.
   The FBI does not require agents to register with local
authorities weapons used for official duties, according to Ray
McElhaney, an FBI spokesman. He declined to say whether a
.22-caliber revolver, the weapon used in the shooting, would
normally be approved for use by FBI agents.
   Rowan Jr., a lawyer, testified Monday that he spoke three times
with police about whether the weapon should be registered and was
told he needn't register it, but never got a written statement on
the matter.
   The senior Rowan shot Benjamin Smith, 19, of suburban Chevy
Chase, Md., on the night of June 14 after he caught Smith and three
other youths taking an unauthorized swim in his pool.
   If convicted on the misdemeanor weapon and ammunition charges,
Rowan faces a possible maximum penalty of two years in prison and a
$2,000 fine.

<HEAD>Republican Task Force Issues Recommendations on Developing
Hispanic Talent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republicans today released a set of
recommendations to encourage full development of Hispanic talent,
including a trade policy with Mexico that benefits businesses on
both sides of the border and expanded education initiatives to
lower the illiteracy and dropout rates.
   The Senate Republican Conference task force on Hispanic affairs
said in issuing its recommendations that four advisory committees
had examined Hispanic education and literacy, economic development,
employment, and health.
   ``By taking a fresh look at these and additional issues on the
threshold of the 1990s, we intend to re-energize and refocus
attention on the needs and potential of Hispanic Americans,'' the
report said.
   ``We do not see this potential as different from other
Americans. Rather, we want to ensure that Hispanic Americans have
access to the opportunities and support systems already available
to most Americans for many generations,'' said the committee, led
by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   The task force's recommendations include:
   _Expanding national and local initiatives to reduce illiteracy
and combat a high Hispanic student dropout rate.
   _Advocate programs at the federal, state and local levels and in
the private sector that provide managerial skills assistance to
small minority businesses.
   _Pursue an aggressive trade policy with Mexico to benefit
businesses on both sides of the border.
   _Improve the recruitment of qualified Hispanics into managerial
and professional positions in the private and public sector.
   _Promote health and disease prevention efforts, with an emphasis
on fighting AIDS.
   _Support better access to bonding and insurance for small firms.
   The committee said it hoped its efforts would boost the nation's
appreciation for ``one of our rich cultural treasures _ the
American of Hispanic descent.''
   The Senate Republican Conference is the official caucus of
Republican senators.
   In addition to Hatch, other members of the task force are Sens.
William Armstrong of Colorado, John H. Chafee of Rhode Island,
Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Bob
Dole of Kansas, Phil Gramm of Texas, John McCain of Arizona, Alan

<HEAD>Pentagon Pursues Development Of Earth-Burrowing Warheads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department is pursuing the
development of nuclear warheads that would penetrate the earth
before detonating and which could be a more effective weapon
against Soviet underground command centers.
   Pentagon officials said Monday that Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci had authorized development of the so-called ``burrowing
nukes'' that have been under study for years.
   Military scientists are convinced they would be far more
powerful against underground bunkers than other nuclear devices
that explode on the surface, even if they don't pack the same
explosive power.
   The new weapon, which is highly classified and the
responsibility of the Air Force, is formally known as an earth
penetrator.
   The Energy Department disclosed in June 1987 it had begun
preliminary development work on the warhead needed for a burrowing
missile because it expected the Pentagon to request one.
   According to a Defense Department spokeswoman and other Pentagon
sources, that request now has been formally made. The Energy
Department will be expected to step up its work on warhead design
while the Air Force pursues missile development and integration
work.
   Spokeswoman Jan Bodyani said the Pentagon's Defense Acquisition
Board last month recommended approval of an Air Force statement on
the need for the weapon and Carlucci subsequently approved it.
   She said the final authorization was dated Aug. 19 ``and
approves this program as a new start.'' She would not discuss
program details such as funding and anticipated deployment
schedules.
   Another Pentagon official, who insisted on anonymity, said
Carlucci had directed the Air Force to provide cost estimates and
predicted performance data for a more rudimentary version of the
weapon that could be produced by modifying an existing missile or
bomb.
   ``There will almost certainly be an interim earth penetrator,''
this official said. ``But the authorization clears the way for the
broad-based research needed to produce a brand new weapon.''
   The Reagan administration recently has begun spotlighting Soviet
construction of underground bunkers, saying it appears the Russians
are convinced they can protect their leaders while waging a nuclear
war.
   Earlier this spring, the Defense Department reported in its
latest edition of the publication ``Soviet Military Power'' that
such construction had been under way for 40 years and the bunkers
could ``accommodate thousands of people.''
   A burrowing warhead would not have to penetrate more than a few
feet before posing an increased threat to a bunker, but ``it's not
easy'' to develop a warhead that can withstand the shock of
striking and burrowing through the ground, one official said.

   The viewing area from which reporters and
spectators have watched 25 space shuttle launches at the Kennedy
Space Center will be off-limits to most onlookers when shuttles
start flying again because of safety concerns, officials say.
   The Air Force and NASA on Monday announced the new precautions
at the Cape Canaveral, Fla., space facility, citing studies that
``have shown that the danger to persons on the ground is much
greater than was understood should an accident occur.''
   The restrictions cover the viewing area that overlooks launch
complex 39, where space shuttle Discovery is being prepared for
space.
   A press viewing area 3.5 miles from the launch pads has been
used by media representatives since the shuttle program began.
Invited guests, including astronauts' families, watched from a
nearby VIP area, and Kennedy Space Center workers and their
families also were able to watch from certain areas.
   Under the new plans, most nearby areas will be cleared just
before and during the launch. Details of the plans were to be
explained at a briefing today at the Washington headquarters of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The plan drew protests Monday from Rep. Bill Nelson, R-Fla., who
said at the Kennedy Space Center that the House Committee on
Science, Space and Technology had argued against such a change in a
letter sent Friday to President Reagan.
   ``I don't think an iron curtain should be placed about the
Kennedy Space Center when we're getting back into space,'' said
Nelson, a member of the committee and chairman of its subcommittee
on space science and applications.
   ``The press has been very much a part of the manned space flight
program for 29 years and to arbitrarily say that some of that press
has to be excluded is not right,'' Nelson said.
   NASA officials said the new rules were developed after studies
of the Challenger explosion in January 1986 and the loss of an Air
Force Titan 34D the following April.
   Air Force range safety officers monitor each launch and have the
responsibility of blowing up any rocket that strays out of control.
   During the Challenger accident, the solid-fueled rocket booster
engines broke away and were destroyed by the Air Force range safety
officer. A study of this accident, and of the Titan 34D loss, gave
new understanding of the dangers to people near the launch pad, the
announcement said.
   ``Under certain conditions, a solid rocket booster released from
the vehicle as a result of an accident would follow an unknown
ballistic trajectory rather than begin to tumble on course as had
been previously thought,'' the announcement said.
   Also, the statement said, it was learned that if out-of-control
boosters had to be destroyed in flight, ``the boosters fragmented
into thousands of pieces and the explosive properties of unburned
solid motor propellant were greater than originally determined in
laboratory tests.''
   ``Because of this new information,'' the statement said, ``NASA
and the Air Force have determined that the prudent action is to
minimize the population at the close-in viewing areas.''
   Accredited journalists will be able to work in the area ``except
for the hours just before the launch and the launch itself,'' the
statement said.
   During the prohibited period, only ``media with an immediate
need for the facilities at the press site will be allowed.'' The
rest, it said, will view the launch from a site on a causeway. The
alternate site will be equipped with a countdown clock, audio
commentary and video monitors.
   About 3,000 members of the media have requested accreditation
for the first post-Challenger launch, that of Discovery, which is
expected to occur in about two weeks. The exact number that will be
permitted at the press site has not been disclosed.
   The letter to Reagan from the congressional committee, headed by
Rep. Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., said, in part, ``Although we have no
doubt that the new assessments leading to this proposal are well
intended, the calculation of such risks is highly uncertain.''
   It asked the president to intercede and permit continued access
to traditional viewing areas.

   Political jockeying over family issues is
taking a new turn in the wake of Republican presidential nominee
George Bush's remark that women with newborns should not face loss
of their jobs if they take a few weeks off.
   House Democrats jumped on Bush's comment Monday and urged the
vice president to support a family leave bill that both chambers
are expected to vote on this month.
   ``We would welcome your support for and participation in the
consideration of the bill so that it may be enacted into law this
year,'' five legislators, backed by Democratic leaders, told Bush
in a letter.
   The Family and Medical Leave Act would require employers of more
than 50 to grant unpaid, job-protected leaves to parents of
newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill children; seriously ill
employees; and workers who must care for sick parents.
   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, a longtime supporter of the
measure, reiterated his view in a letter Monday to Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., two of the
bill's chief sponsors.
   The Massachusetts governor said the bill would ``bring us one
step closer to a more humane workplace for all Americans.''
   In the letter to Bush, Schroeder and four other House members
said the Reagan administration has opposed the family leave act
since its introduction in 1985 by Schroeder and Rep. William Clay,
D-Mo.
   ``However, the press has reported a willingness on your part to
reverse this historically held position and endorse family and
medical leave legislation,'' the lawmakers said.
   Last Friday before a GOP women's group, Bush departed from his
text and also from the administration's hard-line opposition to
government-mandated family leaves.
   ``Look, we also need to assure that women don't have to worry
about getting their jobs back after having a child or caring for a
child during a serious illness,'' he told the Illinois Federation
of Republican Women in Rockford, Ill.
   Bush did not elaborate on the remark at the time, but his
campaign is developing a more detailed proposal.
   The letter to Bush was signed by Clay, Schroeder and Reps. Pat
Williams, D-Mont.; Norman Mineta, D-Calif.; and Augustus Hawkins,
D-Calif. Mineta is chairman of a leadership task force on the bill
and Hawkins is chairman of the Education and Labor Committee.
   Dukakis, in his letter to Schroeder and Dodd, left no doubt he
agrees that job-protected leave should be available to men as well
as women and for personal illness as well as a child's medical
crisis.
   ``A father who needs a few weeks to care for his sick son, a
worker who has cancer, or a mother who brings home a new baby _
they should not have to sacrifice their jobs,'' Dukakis wrote.
   The House bill, which counts 16 Republicans among its 151
co-sponsors, would require employers to make 10-week leaves
available to parents of newborn or newly adopted children. Medical
leaves of up to 15 weeks would have to be available. Businesses
employing fewer than 50 would be exempt for at least three years.
   The small business community is fighting the family leave bill
on the grounds that it would create hardships for their companies
and that the government shouldn't dictate employee benefits.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, has estimated the bill would cost businesses less than
$200 million.

   A Rockville man has been charged with
murdering his common-law wife although police said they ``don't
even know where to begin looking for the body'' of the woman who
disappeared in July.
   Gregory Tu, 58, was arrested at a Las Vegas, Nev., hotel on
Saturday, a day after Montgomery County police charged him with
first-degree murder in the suspected death of 42-year-old Lisa Tu.
   Police said scientific and circumstantial evidence led them to
conclude that the woman had been slain at the couple's home in
Rockville.
   ``We don't even know where to begin looking for the body,'' said
Capt. Robert F. McKenna, the county's chief of detectives.
   Police said they interviewed people who spoke of discord in the
couple's marriage. Other factors cited by the police were
allegations that Tu threw out his wife's favorite love seat shortly
after she disappeared, traces of blood found where the love seat
had stood in the home and Tu's departure for Las Vegas before he
was scheduled to take a polygraph test.
   Tu, a marketing employee of a real estate development, told
friends and relatives in July that his wife had gone to San
Francisco to help a friend who was ill. Police said the friend
reported she had not seen the woman and had not been expecting her.
   Lisa Tu' grown son and daughter from an earlier relationship
reported her missing to police on Aug. 10. Tu was questioned by
police on Aug. 13 and 14 about his wife's absence and agreed to
take a lie detector test, but left the state before doing so.
   Detectives said Tu was being held at the Clark County Detention
Center in Las Vegas pending extradition proceedings. The couple had
lived together for about 10 years, police said.

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Jamaica
on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds, ripping the
roofs off buildings and spawning flash floods and mudslides. One
report said 30 people were killed.
   Doren Miller, general manager of Radio Cayman, told The
Associated Press that a lawyer in Jamaica called the radio station
and said at least 30 people had died across Jamaica as the brunt of
the storm lashed the Caribbean island Monday afternoon.
   Miller said his station's correspondent in Jamaica reported that
hundreds of families had fled their homes because of rising
floodwaters.
   The hurricane pounded Kingston on the southwest coast and
Montego Bay and Ocho Rios on the north.
   In Cuba, 115,000 people were evacuated from their homes as a
precaution in five eastern provinces when Gilbert's winds brushed
the island, said Prensa Latina, the government news agency.
   Authorities in Kingston said looters stole mattresses from a
hospital, the roof was torn off a home for physically handicapped
people and a firefighter was hurt when heavy winds blew him off his
truck.
   Bob Sheets, director of National Hurricane Center, in Coral
Gables, Fla., said his office was in touch with a meteorological
office in Kingston as the eye of the storm passed over city. On the
leading edge of hurricane, winds gusted to 140, he said.
   ``Then on the trailing edge of the eye wall, there were winds
just as strong and they said they couldn't see anything outside
their windows,'' Sheets said. ``It was quite a frightening
experience for them.''
   At midnight EDT, Gilbert was centered near latitude 18.5 north,
longitude 79.5 west, or 135 miles east-southeast of Grand Cayman,
the National Hurricane Center reported.
   ``The hurricane is moving toward the west near 17 mph,'' the
center said in a statement. ``This motion will bring the center of
the hurricane over or near Grand Cayman in the early morning hours
Tuesday.''
   The Cayman Islands, south of Cuba, are flat and have few
sheltered areas, the center said.
   In Kingston, Jamaica's capital with 750,000 people, the initial
30-minute shock of the storm let up as the hurricane's eye moved
across the city. Skies brightened, winds died and people waited for
an hour before the second blow arrived.
   Amateur radio operators in the United States said they received
reports of buildings collapsing and severe power outages across
Jamaica.
   Bill Carpenter of Shelby County, Ala., said he monitored a
report from a radio operator staying at the Wyndham Hotel seven
miles east of Montego Bay ``and the building was shaking badly by
his description.''
   ``They've been without power in Jamaica since last night for the
most part and telephone service has been real, real spotty,''
Carpenter said.
   Another ham radio operator went off the air after reporting
storm damage at his house near Montego Bay, Carpenter said.
   ``When he got back on the air, he said most of his house had
disappeared,'' Carpenter said. ``It's been a heart-rending
listening to them all day.''
   Amateur radio operator Martin P. Maragni of Coconut Creek, Fla.,
said he also received transmissions indicating widespread and heavy
damage in Montego Bay.
   ``They've had the airport with severe damage,'' Maragni said in
a telephone interview Monday night. ``They had to evacuate the
Montego Bay meteorology center approximately about 8 o'clock this
evening (EDT), so I've been unable to get any reports out of
there.''
   Bob Ebaugh, a National Hurricane Center forecaster, said some
hangar roofs blew off at the international airport in Kingston and
some runway aircraft were damaged. All flights were canceled on the
island.
   Amateur operator Rafael Estevez in Hialeah, Fla., said he has
been speaking with other radio operators in the Dominican Republic,
Haiti, Cuba and Jamaica since Monday morning.
   Estevez also said he heard a report from Kingston saying the top
of a city hospital was blown off and the main television station on
the island was not broadcasting.
   ``People were telling me they saw trees and stuff flying
around,'' said Estevez. ``But so far I haven't heard of anyone
being killed.''
   He said reports from the Dominican Republic and Haiti indicate
widespread blackouts and some damage along coastal areas from high
waves.
   Heaviest damage reports were in Jamaica, however.
   ``The eye of the storm moved right lengthwise down the island,''
Sheets said at 5 p.m. EDT. ``They're getting five to 10 inches of
rain (in Jamaica), and so the mudslides, flash floods and all of
that will be continuing for the next six to eight hours.''
   Sheets said the Cayman Islands has a dearth of sheltered areas.
``They're very flat, there's not a lot of places people can go to
get refuge,'' he
   Miller said at 9 p.m. EDT that Little Cayman had been evacuated,
as well as lower-lying areas of Grand Cayman.
   ``Everyone is waiting with bated breath,'' Miller told The
Associated Press in Puerto Rico in a telephone interview. ``It is
calm here at the moment but we are expecting to take the brunt of
it.''
   Cayman Island airlines was running flights every two hours to
Miami to evacuate as many people as possible before the hurricane
hit, said airline spokesman Claude Chisolm.
   Gilbert reached Jamaica after skirting southern Puerto Rico,
Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Hurricane warnings were issued
Monday for the south coast of Cuba east of Camaguey, the Cayman
Islands, and Haiti, while warnings were discontinued for the
Dominican Republic.
   In Kingston, a policeman suffered a broken leg when a fence fell
on him, another resident was injured when a wall collapsed and a
firefighter answering an emergency call was hurt when the wind blew
him off the fire truck, the disaster office reported.
   The Mona Rehabilitation Center for paraplegics reported its roof
had been blown off.
   Police reported people were stealing mattresses from the
University Hospital and there was scattered looting in the Kingston
suburbs of Westchester, Portmore and St. Catherine.
   There was an unconfirmed report that prisoners had escaped from
Kingston's Gun Prison.
   Jamaica House, the office of Prime Minister Edward Seaga, was
the crisis center. Seaga said in a radio interview that he would
seek international aid.
   Most of Jamaica's 2.3 million people stayed home and boarded up
their windows.
   Prensa Latina, monitored in Mexico City, said 40 mph winds from
the hurricane prompted authorities to evacuate more than 115,000
people from the eastern provinces of Tunas, Guantanamo, Santiago de
Cuba, Granma and Holguin.
   The region is about 90 miles north of Jamaica at its closest
point. More than 80,000 head of livestock in that area also were
moved to safer ground, the agency said.
   In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken precautions but
appeared safe.

   Two clowns who fell in love at a clowns'
convention took a shot at tying the knot in a ceremony that was a
regular circus.
   ``I take Chubby Cheeks to be my awful wedded husband,'' Sparkles
the clown said in the weekend ceremony. ``I promise to love, honor,
and bathe him... And I will not nag at him for eating candy bars,
ice cream and cookies.''
   The bride clutched fake flowers and sported gold tinsel hair,
twinkling gold eyelashes and size 18 shoes.
   Before the vows, Chubby Cheeks, trembling from matrimonial
jitters, tried to make a run for it.
   ``My mother cooks better than her!'' he shouted as he tried to
wobble to freedom in his white baggy pants and oversized shoes.
   He was headed off and returned to the side of his bride, where
he said: ``I take Sparkles to be my lawful-wedded wife, I promise
not to eat peanut butter and cookies before going to bed, I will
help with the housework, I promise to take out the garbage and hang
up my clothes every night, and I promise to visit her relatives
without any argument whatsoever.''
   Chubby Cheeks, whose real name is Ed Savage, and Milly
Fantucchio, who plays Sparkles, met at a Clowns of America
International meeting three years ago.
   Sunday's ceremony at Castle Land amusement park, where the
couple works as clowns on summer weekends, was a dress rehearsal
for a more traditional ceremony later this month.

   A new dairy is bringing back the milkman
and a rich, creamy milk for special customers is this opulent
resort town.
   Palm Beach Milk Co. plans to start home deliveries of milk and
other dairy products this fall with milkmen who have undergone
police background checks.
   ``We're giving people a comfort level, saying, `These guys are
OK. You can allow them on your property and they won't steal your
silverware,' '' said David Young, who founded the dairy with Baron
Jacques Von Spiro.
   Von Spiro, naturally, drives a cream-colored Rolls-Royce.
   In keeping with its upper-crust standards, the dairy isn't using
just any milk. While most Americans drink milk from Holstein cows,
Palm Beach Milk has opted for the richer product of Jersey cows.
   ``A Jersey milk has more of everything,'' said Jones.
   Young and Von Spiro hope to take their product to select towns
and cities nationally at prices about 25 percent above the
store-bought variety.

   Michael Dukakis never will win an award for
stirring oratory but generally he can be expected to deliver his
speeches, aided by a TelePrompTer, without major gaffes.
   But even the unemotional Dukakis had to step back from the
microphone and laugh at himself after flubbing a line in a speech
on national security Monday at a union hall in Philadelphia.
   The Democratic nominee had just finished railing against Vice
President George Bush for his role in the Iran-Contra affair and
promised that a Dukakis admininstration never would sell arms to a
terrorist nation.
   His text then called for the following line: ``I don't question
George Bush's patriotism.''
   Instead, Dukakis said: ``I don't question George Bush's
terrorism.'' He immediately realized his error and, after taking a
few seconds to laugh along with his audience, delivered the line
from the text.

   Ohio Sen. John Glenn also is not high on the list of great
orators in the Democratic Party but he delivered a lively and
emotional defense of Dukakis before the same Philadelphia audience.
   Criticizing Reagan administration budget and trade policies that
Glenn said were responsible for the massive U.S. trade deficit,
Glenn said Reagan had failed to use his ``enormous'' powers to
protect U.S. trade interests.
   ``They've talked like Rambo and they've acted like Bambi,''
Glenn said to the roaring approval of the partisan audience.
   Glenn, the first man to orbit the earth, used his stature as an
American hero to defend Dukakis in the flap over his veto of a 1977
bill that would have required Massachusetts teachers to lead
students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Dukakis vetoed the bill after being advised it was
unconstitutional, but Bush and other Republicans have raised the
issue in not-so-subtle attacks on Dukakis' patriotism.
   Glenn, declaring himself to be ``very irritated'' by the GOP
attacks, stood in front of a huge American flag as he denounced the
Republicans.
   ``That Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States is
your pledge, it's my pledge, it's our pledge and it's Michael
Dukakis' pledge,'' Glenn said.
   Glenn also accused the Republicans of ignoring the final six
words of the pledge: ``with liberty and justice for all.''

   Dukakis' visit Monday to Philadelphia was without a major
protest, in stark contrast to an event he held here on Labor Day as
part of his fall campaign kickoff.
   A small group of anti-abortion protesters gathered outside the
union hall where Dukakis delivered a speech on national security
and a handful also met the Democratic nominee outside a
Philadelphia television studio.
   The relative calm came just a week after a Dukakis event in a
nearby neighborhood was disrupted by about 100 anti-abortion
protesters whose chants drowned out most of Dukakis' remarks to
residents of a narrow street where he held an outdoor meeting.
   The advance man who arranged the Labor Day event has since been
fired by the Dukakis campaign.

   Chicken soup is good for you, according to
folklore, but dieticians at Holyoke Hospital say it's too salty for
a healthy heart and have come up with a broth for the Eighties.
   Patients at this 250-bed hospital in western Massachusetts may
dine on ``Just What the Doctor Ordered'' low-sodium, low-fat
chicken soup.
   ``A typical 7-ounce portion of dried soup contains 726
milligrams of sodium and the same-sized bowl of canned soup
contains 850 milligrams of sodium, while our frozen `Just What the
Doctor Ordered' soup contains 22 milligrams of sodium,'' Patrick
Ascolese, food services manager at the hospital, said Monday.
   The typical restricted diet for a patient with high blood
pressure or heart trouble limits sodium intake to 1,000 milligrams
a day, he said, so a bowl of commercial soup would just about use
up the daily allotment.
   The chicken noodle soup, as well as a vegetable beef soup, were
an outgrowth of the hospital's 2-year-old frozen meal program for
recently released patients and the elderly, Ascolese said.
   The hospital began looking into packaging frozen meals after
federal reimbursement regulations were changed in 1984 to shorten
average hospital stays, he said.

   At least 14 people were injured Monday
when Sinhalese militants attacked a bus in Colombo during a
national general strike called by anti-government Sinhalese, police
reported.
   They said strike enforcers hurled a bomb at the bus, one of the
few state-transport vehicles operating, and several of the victims
were hospitalized.
   The driver of another bus was stabbed for defying the strike
call and a bus was set afire, according to police.
   Police and army patrols were deployed throughout the capital.
   A few shops and banks opened Monday morning but were shuttered
by noon.
   The Sinhalese People's Liberation Front called the strike to
protest the death of lawyer Vijedasa Liyanarachchi while in police
custody.
   Liyanarachchi, 35, died on Sept. 3, nine days after he was
arrested in southern Sri Lanka and accused of being linked to
several assassinations. The front said an autopsy report indicated
he died from more than 100 internal injuries caused by a blunt
instrument.
   The government has ordered a public inquiry into the death.
   The government has blamed the Liberation Front for killing more
than 500 people, including members of the ruling United National
Party, security personnel and supporters of an India-mediated
accord aimed at ending the 5-year-old civil war between Sihnalese
and Tamils.
   Liberation Front leaders claim the July 1987 agreement gives too
many concessions to Tamils who comprise 18 percent of the island's
16 million people.
   Tamil separatists have been fighting for a homeland in northern
and eastern Sri Lanka. Most Tamils are Hindus and they accuse the
Buddhist Sinhalese majority of discrimination.

   Ex-Beatles drummer Ringo Starr halted the auction
of a 1965 bass drum bearing the famous British rock group's logo
because of a wrangle over its ownership.
   The drum was expected to fetch $50,000 in a rock'n'roll
memorabilia sale at Sotheby's auction house Monday.
   The auction catalog said the drum was given to George Peckham,
who worked in the group's Apple Recording studios.
   A spokesman for Starr's lawyers, Frere Cholmeley, said Starr won
a court order Friday preventing Peckham or Sotheby's from selling
the drum. Auctioneer Hilary Kay said she learned of the court order
just minutes before the auction began.
   Cholmeley said Starr would agree to the sale going ahead only if
the proceeds went to a children's hospital in London.

stage that truly satisfies.

   ``I don't really feel that film has tapped my potential,'' said
the star of such movies as ``Honeysuckle Rose,'' ``Voices,'' ``The

   ``I kind of got swept up in it (making films),'' Miss Irving

myself, `Something is not being fulfilled here and I went off to
think about it all.' And the next move I made was to do `Amadeus'
on Broadway. And suddenly I went, `Ahh, that's what's been missing.'
   ``I felt more gratification on stage than in front of a

   Former Mayor Mike Roark, who resigned
last year after pleading guilty to federal drug possession charges,
soon will be offering his conservative opinions to radio listeners.
   Roark, a Republican, will go on the air once or twice a month on
West Virginia Public Radio to comment on current events, said
station spokeswoman Beth Vorhees. His first segment will run in the
next few weeks, she said.
   West Virginia Public Radio has about 12 commentators who receive
$5 for offering their two cents, she said.
   ``This is not a full-time, hired position,'' Vorhees said
Monday. ``He's doing us a favor. We needed a conservative
commentator, so we asked him.''
   Roark pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor charges of cocaine
possession and was sentenced to 179 days in prison Jan. 14. As part
of a plea bargain, he resigned as mayor. He was released July 20
after serving 5{ months of his term.

   Actress Jessica Lange says she sees the family
unit disintegrating in the United States and fears that it's a
``signal of the end.''
   ``You know, if you don't like your wife, you can get rid of her;
if you don't like your husband for a day, you can get rid of him,''

   ``I think that's what's wrong with civilization in America,''
Lange said.
   The star of ``Frances,'' ``Tootsie'' and ``Sweet Dreams'' says
she fears the erosion of the family unit is ``a signal of the end,

   Despite her feelings, Lange has resisted remarrying. She lives
with playwright Sam Shepard and they have two children. She has a
third child by dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov.
   Her marriage to a Spanish photographer ended before she became

   Eastwood films and artifacts also will go to the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, the school said.
   The museum will hold the original prints of Eastwood's films,
starting with ``Play Misty for Me,'' the 1971 thriller which
Eastwood starred in and directed.
   Jeanine Basinger, the archive's curator, said the collection is
likely to include scripts, photographs, correspondence and other
``working papers.'' She said the full contents of Eastwood's
collection won't be known until it is received at Wesleyan and

<HEAD>Trial Begins for Preacher Accused in Handyman's Decapitation</HEAD>

   Parishioners who once admired their
minister of nearly two decades expressed mixed emotions as he went
on trial on charges he decapitated a handyman in an attempt to
assume a new identity.
   The Criminal Court trial of the Rev. David Terry began Monday
with jury selection, which is expected to take most of the week. He
is charged with first-degree murder and arson, and faces the death
penalty.
   James C. Matheny's decapitated body was found in a rolled-up
carpet in the burned-out remains of the Emmanuel Church of Christ
Pentecostal Oneness where Terry, 43, preached.
   ``Two days before this happened we would have given him our last
dime,'' said Marsha Brown, 30, who with others in the congregation
has been attending weekly services in a borrowed building in nearby
Gallatin. ``I don't feel personally betrayed. More let down than
anything else.''
   ``It's just a lot of mixed feelings about him (Terry) right
now,'' said Teresa Matheny, the victim's ex-wife. ``I hope he can
tell the truth so that he will have a chance of getting forgiveness
from God.''
   Mrs. Matheny said she and the victim were close to a
reconciliation when his body was found June 15, 1987.
   The congregation, once closely knit, was stunned by the slaying
and the church's burning.
   Some parishioners, though, have stuck by Terry. The congregation
numbers about 40. About 20 members have left since the slaying,
Mrs. Brown said.
   ``I think as far as the evidence is concerned I believe he's
guilty,'' said Marlane McClanahan, 35, who has not been attending
services held by the current pastor, the Rev. Wayne Cole. ``I'm sad
for him (Terry). I guess I'm a little bitter, but you have to keep
the love of God no matter what.''
   ``He was a friend,'' Virginia Howard, 63, another member of the
congregation, said of Terry. ``We had known him since he was a boy.
Our children and he grew up together. There wasn't anything ever
bad about the boy. He just did good things. We're amazed that
someone we've known and never knew anything bad against is guilty
of this.''
   Police say Terry tried to fake his own death by putting his belt
and other clothing on the headless body, which also was missing
part of the right arm and two spots where Matheny had tattoos.
   Court documents allege that Matheny, 32, was killed in Terry's
attempt to assume a new identity and disappear with $50,000 in
church funds. A driver's license with Terry's photograph but issued
in the name of a man dead since 1951 was later recovered with other
false identification issued in the same name.
   Matheny's head and arm were cut off with butcherlike precision,
police said. Terry once earned extra money as a supermarket butcher.

<DATELINE>LAKE WILDWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wind-whipped fire racing through
the Gold Rush country of the Sierra Nevada foothills Monday
destroyed 138 homes and other structures and forced more than 8,000
people to evacuate.
   Some 4,500 residents of the Lake Wildwood area, where some
houses cost $1 million, were forced from their homes twice in the
past two days as the out-of-control wildfire raged through rugged
terrain.
   Late Monday, hundreds more were ordered from the communities of
Smartville, Rough and Ready and Penn Valley, said state Office of
Emergency Services spokesman David Sandino, bringing to 3,500 the
number evacuated from that area in two days.
   Two firefighters were injured and others had to dive for cover
as capricious winds drove the fire through timber and dry brush
about 60 miles northeast of Sacramento, or about 150 miles
northeast of San Francisco.
   The latest evacuations were ordered after the fire's 70-foot
flames jumped a highway and headed southwest, threatening hundreds
of scattered rural dwellings.
   ``There are hundreds here and they are pouring in,'' said Red
Cross worker Elizabeth Quirk, at the Nevada Union High School
evacuation center. ``The school buses are bringing in senior
citizens, and there are campers and motor homes in the parking
lot.''
   By late Monday, the blaze dubbed the 49er Fire had burned an
estimated 15,000 acres, or nearly 25 square miles, of western
Nevada County. Flames threatened the high technology Grass Valley
Group, the county's largest employer with 1,000 workers.
Authorities said the fire reached three sides of the company's
grounds, and that a storage shed had been burned.
   The Yuba County Board of Supervisors met in emergency session in
Marysville to declare the zone a local disaster area, and expressed
concern that the fire may threaten Beale Air Force Base near
Marysville, 20 miles to the west of the fire and the home base of
the SR-71 ``Blackbird'' spy plane.
   The blaze was fueled by drought-dry brush, wood shake roofs and
propane tanks which exploded like small bombs in the intense heat,
said state Department of Forestry spokesman Charlie Jakobs.
   The destroyed structures were valued at $9 million, according to
the U.S. Forest Service. Along with 84 homes, 54 outbuildings also
were razed, said Ann Westling, a Forest Service spokeswoman. She
said the figure represented only a preliminary estimate of losses
and that it could climb higher.
   Two firefighters were burned when their truck was caught in
flames. One suffered leg burns, was wrapped in wet gauze and taken
by helicopter to a nearby hospital. The other man was treated at
the scene.
   About 40 men in two fire crews were forced to use their portable
fire shelters when wind shifted suddenly and swept the flames over
them.
   Flames engulfed a bulldozer, forcing the operator to wrap
himself in an asbestos blanket and take refuge under the vehicle.
   It was one of 11 fires that destroyed nearly 30,000 acres of
timber and brush in five rural California counties Monday.
   Residents of this affluent mountain town of 4,500 people 45
miles northeast of Sacramento and the tiny town of Rough and Ready
were evacuated Sunday, and Highway 49 was closed.
   They were allowed to begin returning home Monday morning, but
were ordered evacuated again later.
   Smartville, evacuated later, is about 15 miles west of the
Nevada City-Grass Valley area, the largest communities in the
region. Penn Valley and Lake Wildwwood are about six miles west of
Nevada City.
   A force that had grown to 1,700 firefighters saved the majority
of the resort homes, but flames destroyed 13 large resort homes,
five boats and a dock. Nineteen other structures outside of the
Lake Wildwood area were destroyed, including several residential
trailers and agricultural buildings.
   It skipped through the community, burning yards and oak trees
between large houses, some valued at $1 million.
   In some places, flames reached the town lake, igniting marina
railings, several boats and a dock.
   ``I was coming back from the Bahamas, sitting in San Francisco
International Airport, and I see my father's house burning on
television,'' said insurance agent Don Sanzone, 41. He said the
3,000-square-foot home was destroyed even though it was separated
from the forest by pavement.
   ``It's amazing, one burns down right in between others that
don't, and this one that burned had a tile roof.'' said Fes
Venardi, 67, who lives two house away from one destroyed home.
   ``I never thought this would happen,'' Sanzone said. ``I didn't
think there was enough underbrush, but the wind was blowing so
bad.''
   Wind was estimated at 25 to 30 mph Monday throughout most of
northern California, but higher gusts were reported on the fire
lines.
   ``The wind is our biggest enemy out here today,'' said Jakobs.
``We had a solid front of fire about a half-mile long moving at a
rapid rate through dense brush and timber.''
   The 49er fire reportedly started along Highway 49 _ named for
the 1849 Gold Rush towns it winds among _ about six miles north of
Nevada City by a transient burning toilet paper.
   The fire spread southwest away from the nearest populated areas.
But pushed by gusting winds, it quickly skipped in a matter of
hours over nearly 10 miles of unpopulated foothills to the posh
Lake Wildwood area.
   A second Nevada County fire burned along Highway 49 in an area
of brush, light timber and scattered homes midway between Grass
Valley and Auburn.
   Most schools were closed in the region. Thick smoke made it
unsafe to operate school buses, and the Red Cross converted at
least three schools into temporary evacuation centers.
   The Lake Wildwood residents, some of whom fought alongside fire
crews, were first pulled out Sunday. They were allowed to return
early today only to be ordered out later, said Jakobs.
   State Department of Forestry information officer John Carter
said about 5,000 state, federal and local firefighters were
battling nine other timber and brush fires Monday, mostly in remote
areas. No homes were destroyed in any of those blazes.

<HEAD>She Wants to Help Guide Young People in Amoral World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new Miss America says her title should give
her a platform to help young people lost in an increasingly amoral
society.
   ``I'm an ambassador now for America,'' Gretchen Elizabeth
Carlson told a news conference Monday.
   ``I feel that we are living in an amoral world, that society has
truly lost its bearings, its moral values,'' said the 22-year-old
from Anoka, Minn.
   Crowned early Sunday in Atlantic City, N.J., Miss Carlson said
she wants to attend Harvard Law School and become a lawyer.
   Among the country's problems are the ``divorce rate, drugs,
violence, sex issues,'' she said.
   ``All of these things are manifestations of the breakdown of the
family actually. I feel that's where it starts. Our morals and our
values. Our society is lax.''
   In addition, Miss Carlson has found that ``our children today
are more narcissistic. They are in love with themselves. We are in
an individualistic era.''
   One solution would be better education, she said.
   ``My concern about education is that there is not enough time
being spent on curriculum,'' she said. ``I don't necessarily think
it would involve more funds to help this problem. I think we just
need more stringent guidelines.''
   Another solution is to teach about volunteerism, she said.
   Miss Carlson said she can help as Miss America because people
will listen to her. She said her outstanding attribute is her
intelligence.
   A registered Republican, Miss Carlson said she voted in 1984 for
President Reagan but has not made up her mind about whether to vote
for Vice President George Bush or Gov. Michael Dukakis in November.
   Miss Carlson said she disagreed with a recent runner-up at a
California pageant who turned out to be a feminist opposed to Miss
America-type contests.
   ``She talks about exploitation. It is exactly the opposite. We
are showing off what the young women of today truly are,'' she said.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Find Prehistoric Artifacts In Colonial Barracks

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaelogists sifting through the rubble of
a colonial barracks that housed Hessian soldiers defeated by George
Washington in the Revolutionary War have found some surprises:
prehistoric artifacts almost 4,000 years old.
   ``It's really turning out to be a very exciting project,''
project director Ian Burrows said Monday. ``It shows there are
well-preserved prehistoric remains right underneath Trenton.''
   The dig by the Hunter Research Associates archaeological firm
began about four weeks ago in this state capital as part of the
$2.4 million renovation of Old Barracks Museum.
   The barracks _ a bunkhouse where soldiers lived joined to an
officers' house _ was built in 1758. It was used at various times
through history to house British and American soldiers, smallpox
victims and single women and widows. The original no longer stands,
and a reconstruction forms the museum.
   However, the structure is best known for its significance in the
Battle of Trenton in 1776. In December of that year, Gen.
Washington's war-weary soldiers crossed the Delaware River into New
Jersey and defeated Hessian troops stationed at the barracks.
   It marked the first time Hessians _ West German mercenaries who
fought for the British _ were defeated by Washington, who went on
to win several key victories.
   The state hired Burrows' firm to determine the original layout
of the building, as well as to find the parade grounds where
soldiers performed military drills.
   But in the course of their work, the archaeologists discovered
artifacts and sites dating back nearly 4,000 years.
   For instance, near the southwest section of the building,
workers found projectile points _ some resembling arrowheads _ and
other artifacts dating back to 2000 B.C., said Dick Regensburg, a
prehistoric specialist working on the project.
   Historians are excited by the finds, said museum director
Cynthia Koch.
   ``We've had a lot of prehistoric archaelogists from all over the
state coming over to look,'' she said.
   Near the southeast part of the building, archaeologists
discovered part of an Indian hearth from between 500 and 700 A.D.
Workers also uncovered a piece of a clay tobacco pipe, carrying a
design that dates it to between 1000 and 1500 A.D.
   The findings suggest the area was a popular settlement used over
and over by succeeding generations because it sits on a bluff near
the Delaware River and between two streams _ the Assunpink Creek
and Petty's Run.
   ``When people started to think about it, it made perfect
sense,'' said Ms. Koch.
   As for the original renovation project, Burrows and his crew
have found evidence of support posts for the second-floor
balconies, a possible staircase in the front of the building, and
ground-level windows which seemed to have been bricked up about 20
years after the structure was built.
   Workers also found part of the parade grounds, Burrows said.
   A musket ball and boot spur are among a number of artifacts
dating back about 240 years found near the building's foundation,
he said.
   ``The archaeological evidence is very well preserved,'' Burrows
said. ``There's a lot of information in the ground.''

<HEAD>Port Workers Strike; Students Clash With Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees of the port at the Pacific
end of the Panama Canal stopped most operations in a strike to
demand payment of bonuses, and students protesting the delays
clashed with police, sources said.
   Luis Asprilla, secretary general of the Workers' Association,
said the strike by most of the port's 800 employees paralyzed cargo
and fueling operations Monday and stopped food and water supplies
to ships.
   He said the strike would continue indefinitely.
   Panama Canal operations were not affected.
   Asprilla said workers were demanding the government pay
one-third of annual bonuses.
   About 20,000 government employees held a demonstration last
Thursday to demand payment of similar annual bonuses.
   The government, financially strapped in part by U.S. economic
sanctions, has said it will make the payments soon but does not
have sufficient funds now.
   In a related incident, a group of high school students
protesting the late payments clashed with police outside a school
Monday, witnesses said.
   A leader of the parents' association of the school, the National
Institute, said 20 students were struck by police. Police denied
the report.
   The Education Ministry closed the school indefinitely.
   Last week, a cash shortage forced the Cabinet to cut the pay of
Gen. Manuel Noriega and other top officials from 12.5 percent to 30
percent. A government communique said the cuts would save about
$230,000 a month.
   Panama's once-thriving economy has been hard-hit by several
months of political protests demanding Noriega's ouster, U.S.
sanctions imposed to force the general to leave, and a period when
banks were closed or handled only limited operations. Business
sources say the economy is about half what it was in early 1987.
   Earlier this year, the government had trouble meeting its
payroll.
   Noriega, who as commander of the Defense Forces is the power
behind the civilian government, is charged with drug trafficking in
the United States.
   He denies the charges and accuses the United States of trying to
undermine the Panamanian government as part of a plan to avoid
turning the Panama Canal over to the Central American country under
treaties signed in 1977.

GOP Races</HEAD>

   Voters settle primary contests in six states today, including a
high-stakes Democratic Senate race in Wisconsin, bitter legislative
battles in Arizona, and Republican clashes in two states where
mothers of small children were criticized for seeking office.
   In Wisconsin, Democrat William Proxmire's decision to retire
after 31 years in the Senate enticed four members of his party into
the race, including former Gov. Anthony S. Earl, who lost a
re-election bid two years ago. Earl appeared to be the front-runner
until the entry of Milwaukee Bucks basketball team owner Herbert
Kohl, who spent $2.1 million, much of it his own money, on TV ads.
   A poll published by the Milwaukee Journal on Sunday showed Kohl
preferred by 43 percent of the voters, Earl by 40 percent, Edward
R. Garvey, an unsuccessful Senate candidate in 1986, by 8 percent,
Secretary of State Douglas J. La Follette 5 percent, and 4 percent
undecided. The poll had a margin of error of 6 percent.
   The heavy spending by Kohl became a major campaign issue,
especially since Proxmire spent just $145.10 in his last race.
   La Follette, who reported spending $15,536, ran a radio
commercial that began with the sound of a toilet flushing, his way
of saying that a Wisconsin tradition of personal campaigning was
going down the drain.
   A Garvey commercial showed a Frankenstein monster with a
television on its shoulders and a Kohl ad on the screen. In the
background, film clips from horror movies showed citizens fleeing
in terror.
   The Republican field was smaller but the fighting was just as
intense, with Senate Minority Leader Susan Engeleiter pitted
against former state party chairman Stephen B. King. Engeleiter
labeled King an ultraconservative, while he condemned her as a
liberal and also questioned whether she could campaign for and hold
an office like the Senate while also taking care of two small
children.
   In the Journal poll, Engeleiter held a 61 percent to 30 percent
lead.
   Motherhood also became an issue in New Hampshire, where former
state legislator Betty Tamposi and former state Supreme Court
Justice Charles Douglas are the front-runners in a six-way GOP race
for the nomination to succeed Republican Rep. Judd Gregg.
   Last week, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, a Douglas supporter, said
Tamposi should stay home and care for her toddler daughter.
Humphrey apologized for his ``dumb'' remark after it was roundly
denounced and deplored by virtually everyone.
   Gregg gave up his seat to run for governor after Republican
incumbent John Sununu announced he was retiring. Gregg is heavily
favored in the GOP primary against Robert Shaw, a former Manchester
mayor, and political unknown William Lawrence. The winner will face
Democratic lawyer Paul McEachern, a staunch opponent of the
Seabrook nuclear power plant who narrowly lost Sununu in 1986.
   In neighboring Vermont, another longtime Republican congressman
is giving up his seat to run for higher office _ Jim Jeffords, who
is seeking the nomination to replace retiring Republican Sen.
Robert Stafford.
   Jeffords, as popular with Democrats as with Republicans, is
favored in a primary over Michael Griffes, a former Grumman Corp.
employee. Griffes has attacked Jeffords' independence _ which in
1987 earned him the second-highest anti-Reagan voting record of any
House Republican as analyzed by Congressional Quarterly magazine.
   Former GOP Gov. Richard Snelling donated $1,000 to the Griffes
campaign, but declined to endorse Griffes, saying the 35-year-old
political newcomer had not ``sufficiently established his
credentials.''
   The winner of the race will face Democrat William Gray, a former
U.S. attorney.
   In Arizona, the main focus has been on state legislative races
in which a number of GOP candidates are ultraconservative backers
of ousted Gov. Evan Mecham. In some cases, they are challenging
Republican lawmakers who voted to impeach or convict Mecham for
obstructing justice and misusing funds.
   After his removal, Mecham predicted ``a revolution at the ballot
box.'' But he insists that those who keep talking about the Mecham
factor are ``trying to divert the attention of the voters'' from
the real issue _ record tax and spending increases that were passed
after his departure to bail the state out of a deficit.
   The two other states holding primaries today are Minnesota,
where voters are expected to nominate Republican Sen. David
Durenberger for a third term and give Democratic Attorney General
Hubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey III the right to challenge him, and
Utah, which has just one contested congressional race.

   ``Moon Over Parador'' rose to box office
heights in its first weekend of release, taking in $3.27 million
and dropping the latest ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' sequel from the
top spot.
   The comedy starring Richard Dreyfuss, Raul Julia and Sonia Braga
is about an actor drafted to impersonate a dead South American
dictator.
   The film, produced and directed by Paul Mazursky, edged
``Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master'' from its three-week
reign in the No. 1 spot.
   ``Nightmare'' earned $3.2 million, according to a tally of

   Third in the weekend box-office sweepstakes was the
British-American comedy, ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' which took in
$2.8 million in its ninth week in release.

fourth place in its ninth week with $2.6 million in earnings.
   Next was the white supremacy-themed ``Betrayed'' with $2.5
million, followed by the Tom Cruise vehicle ``Cocktail'' with $2.22
million after seven weeks.
   The new-wave western ``Young Guns'' was seventh with $2.17
million.
   The irrepressible ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' continued as the
smash of the summer, placing eighth with $1.9 million in weekend
ticket sales for a 12-week total of $133 million.
   ``Married to the Mob'' placed ninth with $1.6 million and Tom
Hanks' ``Big'' was 10th with $1.33 million.

   Authorities banned a television broadcast
by the opposition because it contained a report on torture of
dissidents, political activists said.
   The banned 15-minute, late-night segment is the only televised
political program allowed to opponents of President Augusto
Pinochet, the sole candidate in a presidential referendum next
month that could extend his rule for eight years.
   Also Monday, six people wounded during street violence Sunday
were reported in serious condition with gunshot wounds. All were
from Cerro Navia, a northwestern working-class suburb of Santiago,
where Gen. Pinochet's motorcade was stoned by angry protesters on
Sunday's 15th anniversary of the military coup in which he seized
power.
   National police responded by using tear gas and water cannon to
disperse demonstrators who hurled stones and set up barricades of
burning tires.
   About 50 people were wounded and 400 arrested, police said.
   The government-controlled National Television Council said the
opposition program was rejected Monday night because ``it did not
abide by the electoral law,'' which grants the government and
opposition 15 minutes each of free time on national television to
carry their message to voters in an Oct. 5 presidential referendum.
   The free nightly broadcasts, from 10:45 p.m. to 11:15 p.m., are
the only television advertisements allowed to the opposition. The
government has ample access to the television, which it controls.
The programs started one week ago.
   A coalition of 16 parties opposing the re-election of Pinochet
said the program was censored because it included an interview with
a judge, Rene Garcia, who told about the torture of political
dissidents by security agents.
   ``We reject the attempt by government officials to determine
what Chileans can and can not see on television,'' the coalition
said in a statement. ``Our struggle in the upcoming referendum
includes the promotion of a complete freedom of expresion and
rejection of any kind of censorship.''
   The government's 15-minute program was broadcast normally Monday
night. In addition, the government has maintained for months a
series of ads urging voters to support Pinochet in the referendum.
   The law prohibits political advertisement on television, but the
government claims it is not breaking the law. It says its ads do
not constitute ``political propaganda,'' but an information to
citizens on its works and achievements.
   The National Television Council that censored the opposition
program includes Education Minister Juan Guzman and several other
government officials.
   The council's secretary, Alfredo Lustig, appeared on state
television to say that the opposition program was barred because
the comments by Judge Garcia had not been authorized by the court
in which he serves.
   The opposition called the council's decision ``illegal and
unconstitutional.''
   Genaro Ariagada, secretary general of the opposition coalition,
denied the censored program broke the law.
   ``The only one that has broken the law here is the National
Television Council,'' Arriagada said. ``This an abuse that every
decent Chilean citizen must reject.''
   When the time came for the opposition program to be broadcast, a
sign appeared on the screen saying it had been suspended because it
``did not abide by the law.''
   Within minutes, residents in a number of Santiago neighborhoods
started banging empty pots from inside their homes, a traditional
form of protest.
   In the Oct. 5 referendum, voters will vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on
Pinochet, the single candidate nominated by the nation's military
commanders, including Pinochet himself as commander of the army.
   About 7.2 million voters are registered for the Oct. 5 poll. If
approved by voters, Pinochet will start a new eight-year term next
March. If rejected, an open election will be held within a year,
with Pinochet remaining in power until then.
   Pinochet toppled the elected government of President Salvador
Allende and took power Sept. 11, 1973. Allende, a Marxist, died in
the takeover.

<HEAD>Paulsen Says Wife Defrauded Him, Files For Divorce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Pat Paulsen, saying his wife of
less than two months bilked him, has sued to end the marriage and
business relationship with the former Linda D. Chaney.
   In a lawsuit filed in Jefferson County District Court, Paulsen,
61, said he filed for divorce from Chaney, 35, in Denver District
Court Aug. 31.
   The suit contends that Chaney altered her written contract with
Paulsen, refused to give him an accounting of finances and
bookings, and diverted at least $200,000 from the Lakewood-based
Pat Paulsen Enterprises to her private accounts.
   The damage suit was filed Friday, the same day the couple had
planned to celebrate their marriage with a reception at the
Aviation Club in Lakewood. The reception never took place.
   Denver District Court officials confirmed Monday that the
divorce petition was filed, but said it had been sealed by a
judge's order.
   Paulsen, now staging his third tongue-in-check campaign for the
U.S. presidency, wed Chaney secretly July 20 in Atlanta, where they
were attending the Democratic National Convention.
   The couple met about five years ago at a Denver comedy club.
Chaney has served as Paulsen's personal manager and booking agent
for four years. Paulsen said he has obtained a restraining order to
prohibit further use of his name by Pat Paulsen Enterprises.
   Paulsen contends in his suit that Chaney met secretly with
reporters from the National Enquirer ``to inspire a story harmful
to Paulsen and his former wife in order to advance Chaney's wish to
marry Paulsen.''
   The suit also contends she faked illness to elicit Paulsen's
sympathy and deter him from obtaining an accounting of his business
affairs.
   A call to Chaney's home early today was answered by a woman who
said Chaney was not available.

   A strong earthquake with a preliminary reading of
5.3 on the Richter scale shook an uninhabited island in the Pacific
Ocean this morning, the Central Meteorological Agency said.
   The tremor occurred at 9:59 a.m. (8:59 a.m. EDT Monday) and was
centered at 275 miles under the seabed near the Japanese island of
Torishima, about 360 miles south of Tokyo. In the capital, the
tremor jiggled furniture in skyscrapers, but went unnoticed by most
people. No injuries were reported.
   The agency said there was no danger of tidal waves.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An earthquake registering 5 on the Richter scale is considered
``very strong'' and a 6 ``severe,'' capable of widespread damage
near the epicenter.

   Legislation on its way to President Reagan
would have the government buy the last privately held land on a
Texas island that is a wintering ground for the world's only
surviving flock of whooping cranes that breeds in the wild.
   The Interior Department appropriations bill, passed last week by
Congress, provides $5.5 million for the purchase of 5,017 acres at
the southern tip of Matagorda Island, officials say.
   The purchase will be the government's third and final
acquisition from the Texas Nature Conservancy, bringing the federal
property on the Gulf Coast barrier island to 11,502 acres.
   Because of growing flocks, the whooping cranes have had to
search for new wintering grounds away from their traditional winter
home on nearby Aransas National Wildlife Refuge.

<HEAD>Britain Says Evidence Of Iraqi Chemical Weapon `Compelling'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government, citing evidence from the
United States, pressed for a U.N. investigation of charges that
Iraq used chemical weapons against ethnic Kurds.
   ``We now consider the weight of evidence of the use of chemical
weapons to be compelling,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman who, in
accordance with British practice, demanded anonymity.
   The United States, Britain, West Germany and Japan asked U.N.
Secretary- General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Monday to send a team
to Iraq to investigate the allegations that poison gas was used
against the Kurds, The New York Times reported in today's editions.
   In a story from Washington, the newspaper cited unidentified
diplomatic sources as saying the request from the four allies
reflects a growing irritation with the Iraqi government for
ignoring U.N. protests over prior use of chemical weapons during
Iraq's 8-year war with Iran.
   The British Foreign Office said it toughened its stand Monday
partly because of U.S. State Department evidence of such attacks,
which led the Senate on Friday to vote for tough economic sanctions
against Iraq.
   The measure still must be approved by the House and signed by
President Reagan.
   Last week the Foreign Office summoned the Iraqi ambassador and
expressed ``grave concern'' about the alleged attacks, but at the
time British officials maintained there was no firm evidence the
charges were true.
   ``There is now compelling evidence to trigger action,'' said the
Foreign Office spokesman.
   He said that in terms of a recent U.N. resolution the next step
was an independent investigation by Perez de Cuellar before a
decision on sanctions.
   Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Sadiq al-Mashat has reiterated his
government's denials of the charges and told Britain to stop
interfering in Iraq's internal affairs.
   British official sources have acknowledged a reluctance by
Britain and other Western European countries to accuse Iraq for
fear, they said, of upsetting the delicate cease-fire in the
8-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
   The Foreign Office maintained Monday it had changed its mind
also because of other evidence, including reports from Western
journalists in Turkey, where thousands of Iraqi Kurds, many
suffering chemical injuries, have fled.
   In a Kurdish refugee camp near Silopi, Turkey, near the Iraqi
border, refugees on Monday showed reporters a 13-year-old boy with
severe burns on his face and neck that they said were caused by
poison gas attacks.
   The Kurds claim Iraq used the chemical weapons as part of a
bloody offensive against the Kurds, an ethnic group in northern
Iraq that is seeking autonomy.
   About 60,000 Kurds recently fled Iraq to Turkey, citing poison
gas attacks.
   In Cairo, meanwhile, Egypt criticized the Senate sanctions,
which a Foreign Ministry official contended were groundless. The
official cited a Turkish Anatolia News Agency report claiming there
was ``no case proving Iraq used these banned weapons.
   Turkey said Friday no evidence of the use of chemical weapons
was found while screening sick and injured refugees.

   The dollar moved lower against the Japanese yen,
while stock prices edged up in lackluster trading in Tokyo today.
   The dollar closed at 133.07 yen, down 0.35 yen from Monday's
close of 133.42 yen. After opening at 133.23 yen, the U.S. currency
declined further, but stayed within a fairly narrow range of
132.95-133.25 yen. Spot trading was a moderate $4.7 billion.
   Dealers said many investors stayed on the sidelines, waiting for
the scheduled release of July U.S. trade figures on Wednesday. But
dollar-selling sentiment continued to dominate the market, they
said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues added 37.42 points or 0.13 percent, closing at
27,794.16. The index rose shortly after the market opened, lost
steam, but then managed to recover in the afternoon.
   ``Steels attracted investors in the early morning and led the
Nikkei to rise, but the market lacked the energy to maintain the
trend,'' said a dealer with Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
   ``The market was not strong enough to keep the trading active
all day long. But investors were at least eager to buy reasonably
priced issues,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 850 million shares.

<TEXT>
   A publishing company closed its offices in
the belief that millions of the faithful will be called to heaven
today in a prelude to the Second Coming. Most religious scholars
and ministers doubt it.
   All such forecasts in the past have been wrong, noted Malcolm
Tolbert, professor of New Testament interpretation at Southeastern
Theological Seminary in Wake Forest.
   Nonetheless, a woman who answered the telephone at the World
Bible Society in Nashville, Tenn., Monday said the office was
closed to give employees time to be with their families. The
company published the book by Edgar C. Whisenant that contains the
prediction, ``88 Reasons The Rapture Will Be In 1988.''
   ``If anyone is left here, they'll be here Wednesday morning,''
said a woman named Lorraine, who refused to give her last name.
   ``The odds of anybody being right are certainly greater than the
odds of winning the recent Florida lottery,'' Tolbert said Monday.
   He noted that such predictions have been made countless times in
the past 2,000 years. ``Nobody's been right.''
   Some evangelical and Pentecostal interpreters of biblical
prophecy believe ``the Rapture'' is a sort of prelude to Christ's
Second Coming.
   But Tolbert said people who believe in the theory support it by
plucking various passages from the New Testament.
   ``People are treating the Bible as sort of a smorgasboard ...
and come out with a kind of unified approach that is not justified
by any single passage in the Bible,'' he said. ``So what you have
is interpretations by people'' who are not biblical scholars.
   Whisenant, a former rocket engineer, predicted the Rapture would
come by tonight. He used mathematical calculations and biblical
interpretations to predict that it would occur in the 48 hours of
this year's Jewish New Year _ 40 years and 120 days after Israel
became a nation on May 14, 1948.
   The time of the Rapture _ by noon EDT _ was determined according
to the hour of sunset in Jerusalem, said KAAY general manager
Dianne McArthur, whose Little Rock, Ark., radio station has been
carrying Whisenant's ``Rapture 88 Ministries'' programs since March.
   Whisenant spent most of Monday in Little Rock trying to spread
his message.
   He fully expects to be taken to heaven today, Ms. McArthur said.
   Whisenant will not talk with the secular press ``because God
plainly told him not to sensationalize this,'' she said.
   Whisenant, a 56-year-old self-taught Bible student, has
predicted on broadcasts carried by more than 90 radio stations
nationwide that Jesus would ``rapture the church'' _ take the
faithful to heaven.
   But several ministers said the exact time of the Second Coming
could not be pinpointed.
   ``How do they know that?'' asked the Rev. M.D. Battle of the
Praise Temple Church in Raleigh. ``Because Jesus said he didn't
even know the minute or the hour. I don't believe (the Rapture) is
coming by Tuesday night. Of course, Jesus could come at any time.''
   The Rev. Tom Vestal of Mount Olivet Baptist Church in Raleigh
said: ``I have had calls from all over the state from people asking
`Do you think Jesus is coming Tuesday?'''
   He said some of the callers were concerned that ``Jesus really
is coming before they have a chance to be married or have a family
or see their children grown.''

   A Greyhound bus smashed into a rock slide
over a river in northern New Mexico, killing five people and and

Santa Fe near the point where the river meets the Rio Grande, State
Police spokeswoman Lupita Carrion said in Santa Fe.
   The driver and four passengers died, 14 passengers were injured
and two passengers escaped unharmed, Ms. Carrion said.
   The bus had been bound for Albuquerque from Denver when the
accident occurred less than a mile north of the Embudo Post Office,
the spokeswoman said.
   ``The bus hit a rock slide,'' which tore away the front of the
bus, she said. ``It did not go into either river.''
   The accident was first reported at 10:41 p.m., Ms. Carrion said.
   The 14 injured were taken to the emergency room of Espanola
Hospital, nearly 20 miles southwest of Embudo, said hospital
administrator Grant Nelson.
   Vern Wittner, transportation supervisor for Greyhound in
Albuquerque, said he was busy helping with rescue efforts and could
not discuss the accident.
   He referred all inquiries to Greyhound public relations in
Dallas. A call to the Dallas office reached a recording that said
the office was closed.

<TEXT>
   Blades of grass and wildflowers
are sprouting through much of the blackened earth at Yellowstone
National Park, heralding a dynamic rebirth in the wake of the
fires, park researchers say.
   The vegetation was spotted around Grant Village, which was
besieged by flames last month, said John Varley, Yellowstone's
chief of research.
   In other areas of the park, scorched pine cones from lodgepole
pines, Yellowstone's predominant conifer, are slowly opening to
spill their seeds to the earth, he said Monday.
   However, it is hard to say how quickly the burned areas will
rebound from the devastating summer of 1988, Varley said.
   In the 16 years since U.S. Forest Service and National Park
Service officials adopted a ``let-it-burn'' policy for most
naturally caused fires, there have been approximately 140 wildfires
in Yellowstone that seared some 33,000 acres, said the researcher.
But those fires didn't fully prepare researchers for this summer's
blazes, so predicting how the forests will rebound is not easy, he
added.
   ``We have a considerable body of knowledge on the rate at which
these things recover,'' said Varley. ``We're pretty confident that
they would come back well.''
   To help make those projections, a team of scientists and
researchers will meet next month to study the aftermath, Varley
said.
   The fires have created a huge laboratory for Varley and his
colleagues that will show them Yellowstone's regenerative
capabilities. It also will show tourists the devastation of fires.
   ``It is not dead,'' stressed Varley. ``There are some tops of
things that are certainly killed. But again, on the basis of the 16
years, that experience that we've had with fire and the research
thereof, we know that there will be a lot of sprouting. We know
that most of the living organisms are underneath the surface of the
soil and still are alive and well.''
   The grasses and flowers that have reappeared around Grant
Village, said Varley, have done so without rainfall.
   ``These plants are remarkably resilient to fire,'' he said.
``Most of the species have insurance policies, so to speak, because
they've been putting up with fire for thousands of years. Some of
the strategies are truly remarkable.''
   One example, he said, is the lodgepole pine. Its cones are
covered by resins that are melted away by fire, causing ``that cone
to open up slowly after the fire passes.''
   ``And so in many of these areas, in places that totally look
like moonscapes, then these seeds are being broadcasted out over
the forest floor right now, and that's the next generation that
will be coming up,'' Varley said.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today it has
agreed with Hungary to open permanent missions, the first
diplomatic relations between South Korea and a communist nation.
   The move to normalize relations stopped short of full diplomatic
recognition, but South Korean officials said they expected the two
nations to establish diplomatic ties in the near future.
   The Seoul government is hoping the Olympic Games, which begin in
Seoul on Saturday, will play a major role in helping to open
relations with communist nations.
   Foreign Minister Choi Kwang-soo went on national television to
announce the two governments had agreed to open missions in their
capitals of Seoul and Budapest to oversee trade, scientific and
cultural relations and consular affairs.
   The two governments agreed to start negotiations on establishing
full diplomatic relations, a ministry statement said.
   ``Both governments expressed their determination to bring their
negotiations to a success as soon as possible,'' it said.
   South Korea has no relations with communist nations because of
its bitter rivalry with communist North Korea. The North has
opposed any ties between communist nations and South Korea.
   President Roh Tae-woo, who took office in February, has worked
to establish relations with communist nations to try to reduce
tension with North Korea and to boost trade.
   Roh wants to establish relations with the North's main allies,
China and the Soviet Union, to reduce their support for any North
Korean threat to the South.
   ``The exchange of missions is very significant in that South
Korea has secured a bridgehead for South Korea's advance into the
East European bloc,'' said a senior official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   China, the Soviet Union and most other communist nations ignored
a North Korean call to boycott the Olympics. The Seoul government
hopes the participation of communist nations in the Olympics will
play a major role in developing relations.
   North Korea said it will boycott the Olympics because its demand
to be a co-host of the Games was turned down by the International
Olympic Committee on the grounds that they are awarded to a single
city.
   North Korea invaded the South in 1950 and sparked the bloody,
three-year Korean War. The two sides technically remain at war
since no peace treaty was signed and the North has staged a series
of attacks on the South over the years.
   South Korea and Hungary agreed last year to establish trade
offices in the first such move between Seoul and a communist nation.
   The Seoul government is anxious to develop trade with communist
nations to open new markets and reduce its dependence on the United
States as its main export market.

<HEAD>NRC: Management Ready to Operate Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Managers at Pilgrim nuclear power plant, shut down
since 1986 under a government order, can handle a restart under
careful supervision, federal regulators concluded.
   A Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspection at Pilgrim recently
concluded ``with high confidence'' that Boston Edison Co.
management controls, programs and personnel are ready to support
safe startup and operation of the plant, an NRC official said
Monday.
   The commission ordered the closing because of technical and
management problems.
   An inspection conducted Aug. 8-24 found no ``fundamental flaws''
that would inhibit reactor or public safety during plant operation,
said Samuel J. Collins, the NRC's deputy director of the reactor
projects division.
   Inspectors reached their conclusions after carefully monitoring
managers' performance and qualifications, said Collin.
   He said the problem of how to decide if managers could do a good
job of running a nuclear power plant by judging their performance
at an idled facility was partly solved by using a simulator.
   The NRC is still evaluating whether the plant should be allowed
to restart.
   Collins noted that intense supervision would be necessary under
actual operating conditions. ``We intend to stay very close to that
station during any proposed restart program,'' he said.
   Boston Edison has proposed a four-month supervisory plan for the
restart process, said utility spokeswoman Elaine Robinson.
   ``It's a very careful, well-considered approach to the restart
process. There will be very intensive NRC oversight, but it also
provides for additional senior management oversight,'' she said.
   The inspection consisted of interviews with licensee personnel,
plant tours, observations of plant activities, and selective
examinations of procedures, records and documents. Inspectors also
observed plant activities on all shifts.
   Most of the senior management is new since 1986, but many
department heads remained in place, Ms. Robinson said.
   The previous management was often unstable, fixing a problem in
one area but then neglecting to maintain the improvement, Collins
said.
   ``The team they have now appears to be committed to the station
and they have a pretty good track record in the industry,'' Collins
said.

   A recount was set for Wednesday in the
Democratic Senate primary after election officials discovered they
miscounted the returns, giving the wrong man the victory.
   Unofficial results Monday showed Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo the winner by
a slim 88-vote margin over civic activist Samuel S. Beard for the
Democratic nomination to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. William V.
Roth Jr. in November's election.
   Nearly 48 hours earlier, Beard was declared the victor in
Saturday's primary. But on Monday the unofficial statewide tally
showed Woo the winner with 20,221 votes to Beard's 20,133.
   At Beard's request, the New Castle County Board of Elections
voted unanimously for a recount. The second tally was scheduled to
begin Wednesday morning, and both candidates expressed anger over
the delay.
   The delay was due to the need to collect voting machines from
around the state, said William Burke, deputy administrative
director for the Department of Elections for New Castle County, one
of three counties in Delaware.
   Woo's win came after Beard lost 2,800 votes when a computer
keypunch error was discovered.
   Meanwhile, Woo became angry late Monday night when one of his
staffers discovered the doors to the Department of Elections for
New Castle County were wide open.
   Woo was at the election department's office and could not be
reached for comment. But his wife, Katy, said they believed the
keys to voting machines were kept in the office.
   Attorney General Charles M. Oberly III said he was contacted by
Woo about the unlocked doors and ordered Wilmington police to guard
the door overnight.
   Election officials learned early Monday that a computer keypunch
operator's error had recorded 2,800 votes too many for Beard,
according to Paul T. Hart, administrative director of the county
elections department.
   The discrepancy came in a district in New Castle County where
there are about 280 registered Democrats. In that district, Beard's
total was tallied at 2,828 votes when he actually received only 28
votes, officials said.
   Woo, a 51-year-old physics professor at the University of
Delaware, became the nation's highest ranking Chinese-American in
state office after being elected lieutenant governor four years ago
in his first bid for elected office.
   His opponent in that election, Battle Robinson, requested and
received a statewide recount. Woo won by 429 votes.
   Beard had been heavily outspent by Woo, a native of Shanghai,
China, who enjoyed the financial backing of Chinese-Americans from
across the nation.
   Beard, 49, had support from most Democratic organization leaders
and labor. He has served as chairman for job creation commissions
under the last four presidents.

<TEXT>
   Author Barry Sadler, who composed the
``Ballad of the Green Berets,'' was listed in critical condition at
a veterans hospital today after being shot in the head in Guatemala.
   Sadler, who has written 20 adventure books, was flown to the
Veterans Administration Medical Center here Monday so he could get
proper medical care, said his literary agent, Bob Robison.
   He had been hospitalized in Guatemala City after being shot
Thursday during an apparent robbery attempt, Robison said.
   Sadler has been unconscious since the shooting, Robison said.
Hospital officials said today his vital signs were stable.
   ``From what we know, it was an attempted robbery. He was on his
way home in a cab,'' Robison said.
   ``He's been living there. He writes down there and lives there
temporarily, on a ranch outside of Guatemala,'' Robison said.
``Barry's always traveled. He sort of lived all over the world the
last 10 years.''
   Sadler sometimes stayed in Nashville, according to Robison, who
said the author was about 46.
   Sadler was a Green Beret when he wrote the ``Ballad of the Green
Berets,'' a hit he recorded in 1966 that sold 9 million singles and
albums.
   He is also known for a series of books on soldiers and
mercenaries that draw from his experience serving in the Vietnam
War.
   ``Seppuku'' is the title of the most recent book, Robison said.

<HEAD>Lawyer Disciplined for Wearing Tennis Shoes in Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A public defender faces a weeklong jail
term for wearing green tennis shoes in court.
   Superior Court Judge William Scholl ordered Ralph Malanga last
month not to wear his green tennis shoes in court. But Malanga
showed up in the shoes the next day.
   ``If you're a member of the Boston Celtics, it's OK,'' he told
Malanga. ``But this is Superior Court.''
   The judge sentenced the lawyer Monday, saying the shoes
detracted from the court's dignity. He further prohibited the
attorney from seeing other lawyers during his jail term.
   Malanga, wearing brown leather shoes, asked Scholl Monday to
drop the matter, saying the issue was moot because neither he nor
anyone else is wearing sneakers any more.
   He apologized, but Scholl was unmoved, even when Malanga told
him that he was supposed to go to trial today, representing a
defendant in a first-degree murder case.
   ``The attitude of a lawyer to the court must be one of
respect,'' Scholl said.
   When a lawyer comes to court wearing green sneakers after he is
told not to, ``it's no longer funny. It's contempt,'' Scholl said.
   Malanga said he probably would try to get the state Court of
Appeals to stay the sentence, then added: ``Maybe I'll just let him
put me in jail if he thinks that's appropriate.''

   The kidnapping of a 6-year-old girl ended with the
suspect lying in the bottom of ditch and the victim's aunt standing
over him with a cocked .38-caliber pistol, authorities said.
   The aunt rescued the young victim and captured the assailant
Monday when she went looking for them, and, by chance, found them
on Lookout Mountain south of Golden near Buffalo Bill's grave,
police said.
   ``I wasn't going to shoot him or anything,'' Marla, identified
only by her first name, told The Denver Post, which described the
incident in today's editions. ``I was scared as he was.
   ``When I saw (my niece) Audrey, I didn't say anything,'' she
said. ``I just pulled the gun out and I cocked it and told him to
get out.''
   Donald Dale Lewis, 26, was being held without bail in the Denver
City Jail for investigation of first-degree kidnapping,
first-degree sexual assault and sexual assault to a child.
   Lewis, who police say is on parole for sexually assaulting a
2-year-old, was being held at gunpoint by the victim's 27-year-old
aunt when police arrived and took him into custody.
   Some last names were not contained in the Post's story because
the newspaper has a policy of not naming sexual assault victims.
   Police said the little girl was playing on the sidewalk in north
Denver with a 5-year-old cousin just before 1 p.m. Monday when a
man grabbed her, dragged her into a van and sped away. The girl's
mother and a different aunt chased the van on foot for a couple of
blocks, then called police.
   Marla said her two sisters came to her house about 1:30 p.m. to
tell her the girl had been kidnapped.
   ``I said, `We'll go look for her,''' the slightly built woman
recalled. ``I had just got out of the shower, and I went and got my
gun and I got my bullets.''
   Because of the ruckus that had been raised at the scene, Marla
figured the kidnapper would be heading out of town.
   ``I told her (the mother) we'd go to this one place, so we drove
up to Lookout Mountain.''
   While the girl's mother was calling her own mother in Elk City,
Okla., from a pay telephone atop the mountain, Marla and the other
aunt saw a van matching the description of the kidnapper's vehicle.
Marla jumped back in her car to follow it while the other aunt
stayed to tell the mother what was happening.
   Soon the van pulled over and the driver waved her by, she said.
   ``But, I got out of the car and had the gun in my pocket. And I
walked up to the car and I saw (the girl) there, and that's when I
pulled the gun out and I told him to get out of the car and told
him to get in front of the van and lie down.
   ``He lay down in the ditch in front of the van.''
   She then told her niece to get out of the van and into her car
and lock the doors. She told passers-by to call the police.
   ``I just held him there until the police came. When the police
came I just walked over to the car and hugged (the girl).''
   Marla recalled that when police arrived, she had to tell them
she didn't know how to uncock the pistol. The officer had her put
the gun on the ground.

<HEAD>Florence's Remains Douse Northeast; Keys Brace for Gilbert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Florida Keys braced for thunderstorms and possible minor
coastal flooding from Hurricane Gilbert today and the remains of
the season's previous tropical storm, Florence, doused part of the
Northeast.
   Gilbert was moving westward away from Jamaica and toward the
Cayman Islands in the northwest Caribbean, packing winds of 125
mph. The hurricane is expected to strengthen as it moves across
open waters.
   The rains left behind by Florence were concentrated mainly on
eastern Ohio, New York and Pennsylvania. Rickenbacker Air Force
Base in Columbus, Ohio, recorded 1.99 inches of rain in the six
hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT.
   Showers also were scattered from eastern New Mexico and eastern
Colorado to Utah, and winds gusting up to 60 mph were reported in
Utah's Cache Valley.
   Early morning temperatures were in the 30s and 40s in the
northern Rockies; the 40s and 50s from the central and northern
Plains to the upper Mississippi Valley; in the 70s in the
south-central states and the Southeast; and in the 70s and 80s in
the desert Southwest. Readings were in the 60s in most other areas.
   Today's forecast called for showers across much of the
Northeast, and rain was expected to extend into the upper Ohio
Vally and into central Appalachia. Scattered rain also was forecast
in the central Rockies and Plateau region and thunderstorms
associated with Gilbert were predicted for southern Florida.
   Highs were forecast in the 70s or 80s across much of the nation;
in the 50s and 60s from the central Rockies to the central Plains
and northern New England; and in the 90s in the valleys of Oregon
and central and northern California, the desert Southwest, and from
central Texas across the lower Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast to
northern Florida and the southern Atlantic Coast.
   At 3 a.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 34 degrees at Butte,
Mont., to 85 at Homestead, Fla.

   A woman who survived last month's crash of a Delta
Air Lines Boeing 727 has filed a lawsuit against the airline and
the pilot, claiming injuries, emotional trauma and economic loss.
   The suit, filed in State District Court Monday by Alicia Hayes,
32, seeks unspecified damages.
   Delta Flight 1141 crashed moments after takeoff from Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport on Aug. 31, killing 14 people. There
were 94 survivors.
   The Dallas woman was not hospitalized but suffered substantial
trauma to her neck and lower back, according to her lawyer, Frank
Branson.
   Delta ``failed to exercise ordinary care that a reasonable
aviation common carrier would have exercised,'' particularly in
regard to inspection, maintenance and repair, the lawsuit alleges.
It also alleges that pilot Larry Davis failed to inspect the
aircraft properly.
   Spokesmen for Delta and its insurance carrier, U.S. Aviation
Underwriters Inc. of New York, declined to comment on the suit.

<HEAD>Cisneros Will Forego Run For Fifth Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saying the time has come for him to
move on, Mayor Henry Cisneros vowed not to seek a fifth term, but
declined to rule out the possibility of running for a higher office
in the future.
   The 41-year-old mayor's fourth 2-year term will expire next
spring, and Cisneros said he will go into private life.
   Along with handing over the gavel to the nation's ninth-largest
city, Cisneros also will pass along some major civic projects he
once said were the reasons he wasn't interested in seeking higher
office.
   When his term ends, the popular mayor and one of the country's
leading Hispanic politicians will have served his native city for
14 years.
   ``It's been work, and it's been fun. Mostly, it's been the most
engrossing and fulfilling thing I've ever done,'' Cisneros said at
a news conference Monday.
   ``Basically, I've been at it for 14 years _ eight years as mayor
and six as council member. That's a long time to go at full
throttle,'' he said.
   ``Our country believes that eight years in a high office should
be enough to get a job done. Presidents serve eight years.
Governors serve eight years. And eight years is a good round number
for a mayor, especially this one,'' he said.
   The charismatic, bilingual mayor has served on several
international commissions, was interviewed by Walter Mondale as a
potential vice presidential running mate in 1984 and was frequently
mentioned as a possible Cabinet-level appointee.
   Last year, Cisneros said he would not be running for statewide
office because he wanted to devote time to San Antonio projects and
to his son, John Paul Anthony, who was born with a congenital heart
defect and stomach abnormalities.
   Earlier this year, Cisneros declined an offer to make a keynote
address to the Democratic National Convention. The former president
of the National League of Cities said he wanted to devote time to
the city projects, which include a controversial $160 million domed
stadium proposal and a regional water plan.
   Cisneros was approached this year by several San Antonio
businessmen about the prospect of forming a business to handle
business investments. He said he has since received numerous job
offers, but declined to elaborate.
   The mayor's salary is less than $5,000. With two daughters
nearing college age and an ill infant, Cisneros supplemented that
income by writing columns and giving lectures. However, he had to
cut back on outside activities because of the health of his son and
the time-consuming city projects.
   ``Today is a little sad for me. It has to be,'' Cisneros said
Monday. ``But I expect to wake up tomorrow morning, ready to make
the most of the next eight months, same pace, same energy, same
devotion to the city until midnight of the day before the next
mayor takes office.''

<TEXT>
   The craziest new gadgets may get the
most attention at the second annual Invention Convention this
weekend, but organizers hope the show dispells the notion that
inventors are wacky.
   ``We're trying to stress high tech this year,'' spokeswoman Suzy
Mallery said Monday. ``It seems everybody pictures inventors as
some kind of long-haired weirdos. And we're trying to change that.''
   ``We've got some high-tech stuff that will blow your mind,'' Ms.
Mallery said.
   A magnetic car that travels 200 mph, a flying boat, an automatic
squeeze-handle screw driver and a sound-emitting chair that is
supposed to provide the equivalent of eight hours of sleep in 20
minutes are among the 300 inventions that will be on exhibit.
   Another thing organizers hope to change with the displays are
the relatively small number of Americans marketing their creations,
said Steve Gnass, a Beverly Hills marketing consultant who runs the
convention.
   ``We think the convention is rekindling America's creative
spirit,'' Gnass said. ``Inventors are the underpinning of our
economic future. Politics have never really done anything
revolutionary for people. It's been technology that's always put us
ahead, advanced civilization.''
   Half of the U.S. patents issued last year went to foreigners,
Gnass said.
   Some 20,000 people are expected to attend the four-day affair at
the Pasadena Center, Ms. Mallery said.
   The convention starts with seminars and panels Thursday and
exhibitions are open to the public Saturady and Sunday.
   Also on tap are more than 50 seminars for would-be inventors.
Panel speakers will include Yoshiro Nakamats, inventor of the
computer floppy disc, and Jack Ryan, who dreamed up the Barbie Doll.

   Gold prices firmed following their sharp fall Monday.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the U.S. currency would most
likely trade in a narrow range before the release of the U.S. July
trade figures.
   A Rome-based dealer with a major Italian commercial bank said he
expected a $12.75 billion trade deficit, wider than June's $12.54
billion gap.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar dropped 0.35 yen to close at 133.07 and dealers said the
market was moving slowly while awaiting the trade figures.
   Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 133.15 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.8455 West German marks, up from 1.8453
   _1.5565 Swiss francs, up from 1.5535
   _6.2807 French francs, up from 6.2775
   _2.0822 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0817
   _1,379.50 Italian lire, up from 1,378.50
   _1.2365 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2395
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6985, compared with $1.6958
late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $420.50 a troy ounce, up
from a $419.25 bid late Monday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $420.80.
   One London dealer said gold appeared hemmed in a tight range for
the near future because it found strong support between $417 and
$420 an ounce.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $420.40, up from $418 late Monday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $3.11 to close at a bid of $422.69.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.43 a troy
ounce, up from Monday's $6.41.

<HEAD>Report Criticizes Soldiers Who Killed Hijacked Passengers</HEAD>

   Soldiers who stormed a hijacked plane in Leningrad
in March shot a passenger in the back and didn't take precautions
to prevent injuring innocent people, a government newspaper
reported.
   Izvestia's article Monday represented a rare public criticism of
the country's security forces, and raised new questions about the
bungled attempt to end the March 8 hijacking.
   ``Our forces are not prepared to act in extreme situations,''
said an article published Monday in the state-run daily Izvestia.
   A family of 11 Siberian jazz musicians known as the Ovechkins
hijacked a Tu-154 plane carrying 76 people on a flight from the
Siberian city of Irkutsk to Leningrad. They demanded that the
Aeroflot Soviet jetliner fly to London or Bonn, West Germany.
   Ground controllers tricked the family into thinking the plane
was landing in Finland, but it actually touched down at an airfield
near Leningrad. A special anti-terrorist squad of soldiers stormed
the plane after the Ovechkins set off a homemade bomb, starting a
fire, Soviet press reports said.
   The soldiers killed a stewardess and three passengers in the
amubush, during which four of the Ovechkins committed suicide after
killing their mother at her request, the official news agency Tass
reported.
   In the disorderly evacuation of passengers, some were forced to
jump onto the tarmac and 35 people were injured, news reports said.
   The Izvestia article, quoting witnesses who testifieed at the
trial of two members of the Ovechkin family that began last week,
called into question the assault squad's actions.
   ``I fell onto the ground, crouched, my hands were twisted behind
me, I was placed with my face to the concrete and shot in the
back,'' said a passenger identified only as Maizel, a Leningrad
student. He implied that the soldiers mistook him for one of the
hijackers.
   ``Then they ... moved me forward several meters (yards) and put
my face down and made me lie with my arms behind my head,'' Maizel
added.
   He said the soldiers beat him on his legs and tried to hit his
face and head, but he shielded himself.
   The prosecutor's office is investigating this incident and other
actions of the rescue squad.
   Two of the surviving Ovechkins, 28-year-old Olga and her
17-year-old brother, Igor, went on trial Sept. 6 in Irkutsk. They
are charged with ``seizing an airliner with a view to flying abroad
with use of arms that resulted in the death of people and other
grave consequences,'' Tass said.
   It said Olga Ovechkin testified that she tried to prevent her
brothers from hijacking the plane.

   The USS Boulder landing craft ran aground
today off central Norway during a NATO exercise, spewing about 880
gallons of diesel oil into the Norwegian Sea, the Allied Press and
Information Center said.
   No one was reported injured in the accident northeast of Froeya
island. It occurred at 2 a.m during the nine-nation Teamwork '88
land and sea maneuver involving 45,000 soldiers, the center said.
   A Norwegian tug was steaming to the scene to help free the ship.
   Late Sunday, the 8,400-ton British logistics landing vessel Sir
Geraint ran aground in the Hemnesfjorden but later returned to duty.
   On Sunday, the British HMS Penelope and the Canadian support
ship HMCS Poreserver collided during a refueling operation. The
Penelope was sailing back to Rosyth, Scotland for inspection.
   No injuries were reported on either vessel, said a Defense
Ministry spokesman in London.

   Rose Boyer loaded her station wagon
with family pictures and memorabilia and her husband, Bud, sprayed
water on the dry grass around their home while a mountain blaze
flickered just up the hillside.
   ``We stayed last night, and I want to stay, but a fire is one of
the worst of my fears,'' she said late Monday night.
   At least 15 homes have been lost in the affluent residential
area and the fire continued to burn on the edge of the community,
about 60 miles northeast of Sacramento, on Monday evening.
   The out-of-control mountain blaze has forced the evacuation of
at least 8,000 people. At least 142 structures, including nearly
100 homes, were destroyed, according to officials who early today
estimated the blaze had burned more than 20,000 acres.
   Around the Boyers' home, separated by a 30-foot street and just
one row of homes from the closest burning trees, about a third of
the homes were still occupied by residents who said they wouldn't
leave until the last moment.
   But Boyer, 48, said one sleepless night was all he and his
46-year-old wife could take.
   ``We stayed last night, but we didn't sleep at all, didn't even
try. We stayed with the house all day,'' he said. ``It seems the
fire came up, backed down and now it's back up again, only closer.''
   For Harry Derrick, 64, and his wife, Jean, 63, the fire that
brushed through this Sierra foothill community was a stunning
shock, but not a new experience.
   ``I'm going to think positively. We went through it before and
we will again,'' Mrs. Derrick said, recalling being evacuated from
a 1971 fire that came near their home in the Los Angeles suburb of
Chatsworth.
   The Derricks moved into their new retirement home here just a
month ago. ``I can't believe it,'' Mrs. Derrick said. ``I don't
even have the drapes up yet. The paint isn't even dry. This is just
terrible.''
   For some residents, the fire made a quick entrance into their
community.
   ``All of a sudden it was here,'' said John Bridges, 30. ``It
swept right past us, even burned the brush under the deck, but the
house didn't catch. I can't image all the things we would have
lost,'' he said.
   Bridges and a friend, Matt Waldrom, 28, said after the fire
brushed past Bridges' home Sunday night they joined about six other
residents to help three professional firefighters.
   ``I couldn't believe those guys,'' Waldrom said. ``They told us
exactly what to do and we saved maybe a half dozen homes, and they
told us, `Watch out. It's coming.'''
   ``It was half a mile away, and two minutes later it was 100
yards away, and we got behind a building and it blew right by us.
I've never seen anything like it.''
   ``It was terrible,'' Bridges added, ``but it was probably the
most satisfying weekend of my life. We saved some homes, and I even
saved my brand new truck.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul began a tour of one of
Africa's most prosperous and democratic countries today as the
Vatican announced a fifth papal visit to the continent next year.
South Africa was not included.
   ``Botswana is an island of peace with itself and its
neighbors,'' the pope told an airport crowd of several thousand,
among them a choir of barebreasted schoolgirls. ``In fact, it can
be rightly called an island of peace in a troubled sea.'
   The diamond-rich nation maintains a Western-style, multiparty
democracy in a region of one-party black-ruled states. Besides
conflict over racial segregation in South Africa, southern Africa
is torn by guerrilla warfare and civil strife.
   Botswana has largely avoided involvement in these conflicts but
South Africa has made several raids against what it claims are
guerrilla centers of the African National Congress, which is
fighting to overthrow South Africa's government. Botswana has
denied that it harbors guerrillas.
   Before the pope flew from Zimbabwe for the second stop on his
five-nation African tour, Vatican spokesman Joaquim Navarro said
John Paul had accepted invitations to visit Madagascar and Tanzania.
   There has been speculation that John Paul also would visit
Angola and possibly South Africa on that trip, expected next May.
Navarro said neither country was ``on the program,'' although he
confirmed that Angolan bishops had recently addressed an invitation
to the pope.
   On his current visit, the pope has coupled condemnation of South
Africa's apartheid policies with pleas for dialogue with South
Africa to solve regional problems.
   According to Navarro, the Vatican plays an active role in
regional peacemaking efforts, and sent French Cardinal Roger
Etchegarray, a top aide, to the region three times in the past
year. Etchegarray met with officials of South Africa, Angola and
Mozambique in May and presented them with a letter from John Paul.
   The pope concludes his tour with a visit to Mozambique on
Saturday. Mozambique National Resistance guerrillas, in a statement
issued in Lisbon, Portugal, said they would declare a unilateral
cease-fire around the Mozambican cities the pope will visit _
Maputo, Beira and Nampula.
   But Navarro stopped short of claiming a mediation role for the
Vatican.
   ``The role of the Holy See in affairs of the region is not and
doesn't want to be a mediation role in the diplomatic sense of the
word,'' Navarro told reporters. ``It wants to create a climate in
which dialogue can be possible.''
   John Paul was scheduled to meet Botswana President Quett Masire
and give a Mass at the national stadium in Gaborone during a visit
of less than 24 hours. The expected crowd of 50,000 at the stadium
would be larger than the number of Roman Catholic church members in
the country, about 45,000.
   The pontiff was scheduled to leave Wednesday morning for the
mountain kingdom of Lesotho, where thousands of pilgrims from South
Africa were expected to attend ceremonies.
   During a three-day visit to Zimbabwe, the pope appealed for
reconciliation and human rights, and for an end to racial and
tribal discrimination. He celebrated two masses, held a rally of
more than 30,000 young people, talked with diplomats and met
Catholic bishops and other Christian leaders from the region.

   Charlie Palmieri, a popular salsa pianist who as
a band leader helped create new forms of Latin jazz, has died,
apparently of a heart attack.
   Palmieri, in his early 60s, was at Jacobi Hospital on Monday
when he was stricken.
   Born in Puerto Rico and reared in the Bronx, Palmieri played
with Latin dance orchestras and hotel bands, including those led by
Tito Puente and Mongo Santamaria.
   In the 1950s, he led various groups, and in 1959, introduced the
band Charanga Duboney, a group that was extremely popular and
influential in New York. In 1961, he became musical director of the
Allegre All-Stars, who merged mambos with jazz solos.
   Besides performing with his own groups and as a guest with other
jazz musicians, he played in all-star ``piano summits'' with his
brother, pianist Eddie Palmieri.
   Several years ago, he suffered a heart attack and was told he
would not regain the use of his hands. But he returned to
performing and recording. His most recent album was ``A Giant
Step.''
   He is survived by his mother; his wife, Esther; three children;
and one grandchild, all of New York.

   Christian militiamen kidnapped Defense
Minister Adel Osseiran on Beirut's dividing Green Line today, but
freed him after the army threatened to move against them, police
said.
   Osseiran, a Shiite Moslem, was released in Christian east Beirut
this afternoon and was on his way to the western Moslem sector of
the capital, a police spokesman said. The spokesman cannot be named
under standing regulation.
   The warning by army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, a Christian,
came an hour after gunmen of the Lebanese Forces, the Christians'
main militia, seized Osseiran, 83, near Beirut's dividing Green
Line and took him to their seaside headquarters, police reported.
   The Lebanese Forces command denied it was holding Osseiran. It
said in a statement that the militia's security apparatus has been
``put on alert with orders to search every corner of east Beirut
for Osseiran.''
   But the police spokesman said the militia command had initially
offered to swap Osseiran for Christian parliament member Farid
Serhal, who it said had been kidnapped in west Beirut on Thursday.
   The Lebanese Forces are the Christians' main militia.
   The police spokesman said Aoun has long been at odds with the
Lebanese Forces over their growing dominance of a ``state within
the state'' in east Beirut and the Christian heartland north of the
capital that has eroded the authority of Lebanon's divided
government.
   ``The general simply cannot tolerate the abduction of his own
chief, the defense minister, in an area that is supposed to be
under direct army control,'' the spokesman said.
   The Lebanese Forces have claimed that Serhal, a Maronite
Catholic, was kidnapped by pro-Syrian militiamen of Druse warlord
Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party at a checkpoint south
of Beirut last Thursday as he was driving to Jezzine.
   The Christians claimed he was was being kept at the Bristol
Hotel in west Beirut ``against his will.''
   The Bristol acknowledged that Serhal has been staying there
``incommunicado'' since Thursday.
   Osseiran's kidnapping heightened tension between Christians and
Moslems amid a political deadlock in efforts to elect a new
president. The political wrangling has raised fears it could
rekindle Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war.
   Police said Osseiran's kidnappers made the demand for Serhal's
return in a telephone call to the office of acting Prime Minister
Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, in west Beirut.
   The spokesman said the Christian militiamen stopped Osseiran's
black limousine at a Lebanese Forces checkpoint on the east side of
the Green Line.
   ``Two militiamen entered the car and drove with the defense
minister to the Lebanese Forces headquarters,'' the spokesman added.
   Osseiran was kidnapped a few hundred yards from a sit-in by
Serhal's supporters to demand his return.
   ``Return Deputy Serhal!'' the protesters chanted as the sit-in
blocked traffic across the nearby Museum Crossing, which links the
two sections of Beirut.
   Serhal was among Christian legislators who boycotted a
parliamentary session called Aug. 18 to elect a new president
because they opposed the candidacy of Suleiman Franjieh, a former
president who is backed by Syria.
   The session foundered because not enough legislators turned up
to form the required quorum. Franjieh, president from 1970 to 1976,
was the only serious candidate.
   Franjieh's followers accused the Lebanese Forces of forecefully
preventing deputies from showing up at the session.
   Osseiran's son, Ali, was kidnapped in west Beirut on June 17,
1987 with American journalist Charles Glass and their driver. Ali
Osseiran and the driver were freed that June 24, and Glass escaped
Aug. 17, 1987.

<HEAD>Former Ambassador to Ireland Dead at 77</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John D.J. Moore, who was ambassador to Ireland
during the Nixon administration and a W.R. Grace & Co. executive,
has died at age 77.
   Moore had been diagnosed as having bone cancer six months ago,
but remained active until about a week ago when ``he took a turn
for the worse,'' said Fred Bona, a W.R. Grace spokesman. He died
Monday at his Manhattan home.
   A 1935 graduate of Yale University Law School, Moore practiced
law in New York City and was assistant corporation counsel under
Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia and an assistant district attorney.
   He was with W.R. Grace, a diversified chemical company, from
1946 to 1969, serving in Peru, Washington and as a vice president
at the New York headquarters.
   Vice President Richard Nixon had Moore accompany him to South
America in 1958 and to the Soviet Union in 1959. When he became
president in 1969, Nixon appointed Moore ambassador to Ireland.
Moore served six years.
   As ambassador, Moore negotiated an aviation agreement that
gained the United States landing rights for U.S. airlines in
Dublin. He also established a professorship of American studies at
the National University of Ireland.
   In 1976, he rejoined Grace as a member of its board. Upon his
retirement at age 75, he became a director emeritus and a
consultant to the company.

<HEAD>NBC Asking Advertisers To Give Up Part of Screen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC officials have asked Olympic advertisers to
allow silent live coverage of certain events to continue during
commercials in a corner of the television screen, according to a
report published today.
   NBC Sports executive producer Michael Weisman confirmed that the
plan had been presented to certain advertisers and said some have
indicated interest, the Daily News reported.
   Under the plan, unprecedented in Olympic coverage, NBC would
superimpose a silent picture in the lower-righthand corner of the
television screen during commercials in sports such as basketball,
volleyball, cycling and long-distance track events. The sport would
occupy one-quarter of the television screen.
   NBC is hoping to avoid the harsh viewer criticism ABC was
subjected to during this year's Winter Olympics, when goals were
scored during commercial breaks of hockey telecasts. NBC has
experimented with the technique during telecasts of major-league
baseball games.
   ``Some of these athletes have worked a lifetime to get to the
Olympics,'' said Weisman, speaking from Seoul, where the Olympics
begin later this week. ``It would be a shame if a great performance
wasn't seen by the home folks because we were in a commercial
break.''
   Advertisers are paying NBC up to $330,000 for a 30-second
commercial.
   Weisman said advertisers should consider the ``good-will'' value
of consenting to the proposal.
   ``Viewers will appreciate the gesture and so will the
athletes,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old mother accused of putting
her newborn baby inside a brown paper bag and dumping her on the
sidewalk says she wants her daughter back.
   The Lake Worth teen, whose name was not being released, turned
herself in Monday and faced child-abuse charges for allegedly
abandoning the baby outside an apartment complex after giving birth
Saturday, said police Detective Susan Pults.
   The baby was placed in the custody of the state health
department and was reported in good condition Monday at St. Mary's
Hospital in West Palm Beach, said hospital spokesman Don Chester.
   Meanwhile, more than 20 families contacted the health department
Monday and offered to adopt or care for the 6-pound, 2-ounce girl.
   The mother told police she panicked after giving birth about
noon Saturday and dumped the baby ``some place where she was sure
it would be found,'' said Pults. The baby was found about an hour
later by an 88-year-old woman.
   The mother feared ``she would be thrown out of her house if she
came home with a baby,'' police said.
   A judge will decide whether to return the infant to her teen
mother, award custody to her grandparents or put the baby up for
adoption, said HRS spokesman Cam Freedlund.
   Police learned the mother's identity after someone called and
told them her name, Pults said.
   The father of the infant was identified, but was not charged,
she said.
   Following the mother's arrest, she was taken to the Juvenile
Detention Center in West Palm Beach and was later released into her
parents' custody, police said.

   Talks are ``moving forward'' on sales of U.S.
military goods to mainland China, Defense Decretary Frank Carlucci
said today.
   ``We are moving forward on a number of programs with the
Chinese. Avionics upgrades for their fighter aircraft and radar
programs, some torpoedo programs. We're discussing some other
programs with them, all within the constraints of our normal
technology transfer program,'' Carlucci said on NBC's ``Today''
program.
   Asked if that means the transfer of military technology to China
will occur, Carlucci responded:
   ``The technology transfer is moving forward, yes.''
   Transfer of some technology to China had been held up in the
past because of concern about sales of weapons to Iran, although
those sales were denied by the Chinese.
   Carlucci, who returned Sunday from a five-day trip to China for
discussions with defense officials there, said that after
discussing the problem with the Chinese he is ``quite satisfied
that they will do nothing to destabilize'' the Middle East.
   But he declined to expound, saying the Chinese prefer that
details not be discussed in public.
   Carlucci said a decision was also reached in principle to allow
the Chinese to launch three American satellites, ``but there is no
technology transfer involved.''

<HEAD>Nixon Adviser Calls Bush Aide's Resignation Unfair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House adviser John D. Ehrlichman
said today that Frederic V. Malek took ``a bum rap'' in resigning
from the Republican National Committee because of alleged
anti-Semitism while he worked for President Nixon.
   In searching out what a White House memo described as a possible
``Jewish cabal'' in the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1971, Malek
was simply carrying out orders from a Nixon who was simply
``venting spleen,'' Ehrlichman said on the CBS-TV ``This Morning''
program.
   Malek had been named deputy GOP chairman by Republican
presidential nominee George Bush, but resigned Sunday when The
Washington Post reported he had compiled a list of senior Jewish
officials in the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Nixon's orders.
   Nixon thought the Labor Department agency was reporting
unemployment statistics with an unfavorable slant. Two Jewish
officials subsequently were demoted.
   ``When all of the facts are looked at I think its a bum rap,''
said Ehrlichman, who was Nixon's chief domestic policy adviser.
   Ehrlichman said the phrase ``Jewish cabal'' written in the
margin of a memorandum was ``straight, vintage Richard Nixon.''
   ``This thing, `Jewish cabal' and all of that, is kind of pure
Nixon venting spleen,'' Ehrlichman said. ``Most people on the staff
really didn't pay any attention to that. They didn't do anything
about it. And those things kind of blew over as kind of rhetorical
excess.''
   Ehrlichman said it was ``extremely unfair'' to Malek, who ``is
the farthest thing from a bigot of anybody I know.''
   ``If you recognize it for what it is, which is a fellow back 17
years ago doing something the president of the United States
instructed him to do and he had no discretion in doing, I think it
ought to just go away,'' he said.
   Malek said in a statement Sunday that he resigned to keep the
Bush campaign focused on the issues. He admitted compiling data for
former White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman, but denied he had
a role in any demotions.
   Bush strongly defended Malek and denied that he was prejudiced.

   A federal judge refused to lift the suspension
of a Georgia Southwestern College professor, saying academic
freedom was no excuse to make a racial remark.
   ``If academic freedom or tenure gives one the right to use
expressions in public that are patently offensive to a particular
group ... then quite possibly the boundaries of proper conduct
should be redrawn,'' said U.S. District Judge Duross Fitzpatrick.
   Fitzpatrick also said in Monday's rejection of a suit by Allen
Towery that issuing an injunction in favor of the professor could
inflame racial feelings at the college.
   Towery, a tenured associate professor of English, was suspended
with pay in March after calling freshman Ginevra Dennis of Atlanta
a ``black bitch.''
   He admitted making the remark, but said Miss Dennis had provoked
him when the two argued over her request to withdraw from his class
with a passing grade.
   Towery said Monday evening of Fitzpatrick's ruling, ``Who could
be happy with this? There's not really anything else I can say.''
   Miss Dennis said she was relieved. ``I thought he might be able
to return, even though he had been suspended.''
   She said she still believes Towery should have been fired.
   After a hearing in June, a faculty committee recommended that
Towery be allowed to teach again during fall quarter. Georgia
Southwestern President William H. Capitan overruled the committee
last month and suspended Towery without pay for the quarter.
   Towery, 50, then filed a lawsuit charging his suspension without
pay was a violation of due process and that his career, reputation
and finances have suffered. The suit asked $250,000 in damages.
   Towery argued in a hearing his constitutional right of due
process had been violated when Capitan overruled the committee.
Capitan said he based his decision in part on evidence not
presented to the committee.
   Capitan testified that his work to relieve racial tensions on
campus would be difficult if the professor returned to the
classroom this month.
   In his ruling, the judge said that Towery ``showed a lack of
discipline when he used a particularly egregious expression in the
presence of a young black woman, whatever the provocation.''

   A freighter carrying a cargo of
beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine
crew members were rescued from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman
said.
   The ship sank at about 12:45 p.m. in high winds, some 28
nautical miles north of the island of Ameland.
   It was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29
miles off the Dutch island of Ameland, according to the coast guard
spokesman, who was not identified. There were no casualties, he
said.
   The coast guard official, who spoke in a Dutch radio interview,
identified the ship involved as the Finnish-registered freighter Ra
and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer. He did not give the
ship's origin or destination.
   The nine crew members boarded two life rafts after the sinking
in high winds. They were taken ashore by a West German helicopter
from the island of Borkum, about 30 miles from the site of the
sinking, the official said.
   A Dutch navy aircraft and two life boats also rushed to the
scene.
   Earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry,
possibly one of the Dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes
between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland.
   Freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its
vicinity to the ports of Delfzijl in the Netherlands and Emden in
West Germany.

<HEAD>Government Urges All Residents Test for Dangerous Radon Levels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The problem of residential radon contamination
appears to be more widespread than previously believed and serious
enough to warrant testing for the deadly gas in every home
nationwide, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency said
today.
   New surveys show particularly high levels of the invisible,
odorless gas in Minnesota, North Dakota and Pennsylvania. The
average home in those states contains radon above the EPA's
guidelines, according to figures released Monday at a joint news
conference of EPA and the Public Health Service.
   Discussing the findings on the ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America,'' EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas said the agency had
believed radon was a major problem for several years, but ``what
this information shows us is that it is a problem in many states,
more states than we had thought. In addition, the estimates (of
concentrations) are a little higher than we had thought.''
   EPA has estimated radon-caused lung cancers could be killing
20,000 people out of the nation's annual toll of 130,000 lung
cancer deaths.
   And though EPA hasn't changed its estimate that 10 percent of
some 80 million homes have radon above the guidelines, the new
surveys in seven states and on Indian lands in two more showed more
than 29 percent of all homes above the guidelines.
   Combined with the results of 10 states surveyed last year, that
means one home in four of the 12 million in the two surveys was
above the agency's guideline of 4 picocuries per liter, said Rich
Guimond, head of EPA's radiation office.
   ``We think we've documented the problem enough to recommend that
every home be tested,'' Thomas told the news conference.
   ``Even if we are off by (a factor of 10), the problem is severe
enough so that we ought to do something about it,'' said Vernon
Houk, assistant surgeon general attending the news conference to
announce a formal public health advisory calling for radon testing.
   Houk said the health toll from radon ``probably exceeds by 10
times outdoor air pollution,'' and physicians should learn about it
to advise their patients.
   Radon is a radioactive gas produced in the decay of uranium
found in all soil and rock in at least trace amounts, and present
in the outdoor atmosphere normally at a concentration about 0.5
percent of EPA's 4 picocurie ``action level.'' Homes tend to
concentrate radon indoors.
   Radon kills by leaving its own radioactive decay products in the
lung, irradiating the tissues for a lifetime. Smoking, itself the
major cause of lung cancer, increases the effectiveness of radon by
15 times, Houk said.
   ``If you have any detectable radon in your home, don't permit
smoking indoors,'' Houk said.
   ``We have not characterized 4 picocuries as safe,'' Thomas
noted, and the agency is studying the adoption of using outdoor
background levels as a goal for indoor programs. At 4 picocuries,
EPA believes a lifetime resident increases his or her chance of
lung cancer by about 1 percent, a risk level larger than any the
agency tolerates in its other programs.
   This extra risk is about equivalent to smoking half a pack of
cigarettes per day, Guimond said.
   EPA has certified that about 1,000 companies are qualified to
test for radon, and the test can be done for as little as $10,
Thomas said.
   The first thing someone confronted with an abnormal result
should do is get it confirmed, ``not unlike a lot of other things
when you go to see your physician,'' Houk said.
   If action is needed, a majority of homes probably can be fixed
for less than $1,000, Thomas said.
   What can be done depends on the house. Some homes might require
a simple sealing of cracks in basement walls. Others might require
complicated systems to draw air from beneath basement slabs and
discharge it outdoors. Still others might be cured by better
ventilation stepping up the exchange of indoor and outdoor air.
   Houk noted that most mortgage lenders require homes to be
checked for termites, and said, ``It is time to certify that our
homes are free from radon'' when sold.
   In Minnesota and North Dakota, the survey identified ``an area
similar in severity to the Reading Prong,'' a well-known narrow
area of high-uranium soils extending from about Reading, Pa.,
across northern New Jersey into New York.
   Below is a list of the states surveyed. After each state is the
percentage of homes above 4 picocuries per liter, and then the
average concentration in that state. Surveys were designed to be
statistically sound, and the agency said there was a 95 percent
chance the true percentages would be within 3 percentage points of
the percentages given.
   Arizona, 7 percent, 1.6 picocuries per liter; Indiana, 26
percent, 3.6; Massachusetts, 24 percent, 3.4; Minnesota, 46
percent, 4.8; Missouri, 18 percent, 2.6; Pennsylvania, 37 percent,
6.2; North Dakota, 63 percent, 7.0; Indian reservations in
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, 20 percent, 2.9.
   States surveyed last year were Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut,
Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Wisconsin and
Wyoming. Surveys are planned next year in Alaska, Iowa, Maine, New
Mexico, Ohio, Vermont, West Virginia and Indian lands in New
Mexico, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa.

<HEAD>Hamburger Chain Founder's Son Ordered to Pay $10,500 in
Insider-Trading Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of the founder of the Carl's Jr.
hamburger chain was ordered to repay $10,500 as part of a federal
insider-trading suit against him and more than a dozen other
relatives and company officers.
   Carl Leo Karcher was ordered to give up the amount he avoided in
losses by acting on inside information to sell debt securities in
Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. in 1984.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie, who ordered the payment
Monday, also issued a permanent injunction barring Karcher from
future insider trades. However, the judge declined to impose triple
damages requested by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
had filed the civil suit in April after trading irregularities were
uncovered in random computer checks.
   The case continues against the other defendants, including
Carl's Jr. founder Carl N. Karcher and his brother, Donald, who is
president and chief operating officer of Karcher Enterprises.
   Carl N. Karcher, who appears in folksy commercials for the
hamburger chain with 450 outlets in California, Nevada, Arizona and
Oregon, is a prominent social benefactor in Orange County.
   The SEC contends that the brothers told relatives in advance of
an unfavorable earnings report on the chain in October 1984. The
relatives are accused of using that information to sell securities,
avoiding losses totaling $300,000.
   If they are found guilty and triple damages are applied against
them they could face more than $1 million in penalties.
   The brothers aren't accused of making trades themselves.
   Carl Leo Karcher maintained he didn't know he had broken any
laws by selling Karcher debentures in October 1984.

   The launch team here is ready to see
Discovery off in about two weeks in the first space shuttle mission
since the Challenger tragedy, NASA says.
   Launch Director Bob Sieck and his team held a launch readiness
review Monday, and concluded there were no ``show stoppers'' that
would bar a launch the last week of this month, NASA said.
   Space shuttle officials from around the country began a two-day
meeting today to assess preparations for the mission and set a firm
launch date.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been
considering a date between Sept. 26 and 29. An announcement is
expected Wednesday.
   The purpose of today's meeting ``is to have all project
managers, both NASA and contractors, to say if they are ready or
not,'' said Rear Adm. Richard Truly, director of the shuttle at
NASA headquarters in Washington.
   ``Then we'll set a date,'' Truly said. ``It will be in the last
week in September, unless there is a hiccup.''
   Among those taking part in the meetings are two of the
astronauts who will fly aboard Discovery, commander Rick Hauck and
mission specialist Mike Lounge.
   The shuttle has been grounded since Challenger exploded Jan. 28,
1986, killing the crew of seven.

<HEAD>70-Year-Old Law Used in AIDS Sex Assault Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors are using a 70-year-old state
law dealing with the spread of venereal disease against an AIDS
carrier being retried for allegedly sexually assaulting a woman.
   Clinton Ray Johnson, 38, is charged with knowingly causing a
woman to be in danger of getting a venereal disease, prosecutors
said.
   Prosecutors believe it is the first time a defendant in the
state who is a carrier of acquired immune deficiency syndrome has
been tried under the 1919 law.
   Johnson is also charged with oral sodomy, with attempted rape
and with robbery after an earlier felony conviction. Jurors were
deadlocked in Johnson's first trial in May on the three felony
counts.
   Prosecutors said the added the venereal disease charge to the
other charges against Johnson after the first trial, after
researching state laws.
   He is accused of attacking his half brother's girlfriend Feb. 11
in his apartment. He contends the woman made up the accusations
after he rejected her sexual advances.
   The woman has had an AIDS test, and it was negative, prosecutor
Wes Lane said.
   Johnson said Monday that his AIDS test was positive but he
hasn't developed symptoms of the disease. AIDS carriers can test
positive for AIDS antibodies without becoming sick for years, but
they still can transmit the disease to others.
   AIDS, which is most often transmitted through sexual contact, is
an affliction in which a virus attacks the body's immune system,
leaving the victim susceptible to a wide variety of infections and
cancers.

<HEAD>United DC-10 Skids, Nose Wheel Snaps In Mud At Stapleton</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines officials are still uncertain
about what caused Flight 225 to skid off a runway and its nose gear
to collapse, the second such accident in recent months involving a
DC-10's landing gear.
   United said there were 197 passengers and 10 crew members on
board the flight, which originated in Hartford, Conn., and made
stops in Detroit and Chicago. No one was seriously injured.
   The nose gear broke when the plane went off the runway during
landing at Stapleton International Airport at 1:50 p.m.
   In May, the nose gear on an American Airlines DC-10 collapsed
when it ran off the end of a runway at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport. Six people were injured in that accident,
which prompted a special Federal Aviation Administration
investigation of all DC-10 landing gear braking systems.
   That investigation is incomplete.
   In Monday's accident, a pilot said he lost control of the
steering on the 13-year-old plane just as it landed, said Lt. Jerry
Stout of the Denver Fire Department. United officials declined to
speculate on the cause.
   Many passengers were shaken after the rough landing _ one
passenger suffered a minor ankle injury during the evacuation _ but
they praised the actions of the crew.
   ``People were really flipping out, but the (flight attendants)
were incredibly under control,'' said passenger Frank Lampe, of
Boulder, Colo.
   The Rev. Jeffrey Loebl, a Jesuit priest from Milwaukee, said the
plane landed ``on a wing and a prayer.''
   ``I was afraid, but all God needs is a good simple act of trust
and he can do the rest,'' he said. ``And there were a lot of people
besides me praying.''
   ``When we got on the bus to take us back to the terminal, we all
cheered,'' Loebl said. ``Once for the crew, because they were
great, and once just because we made it.''
   Passenger Jennifer Bandt said she knows what caused the accident.
   ``The plane got sick,'' said the 3-year-old, who had bumps and
scrapes like many of the other passengers.

<HEAD>Reagan Signing Anti-Discrimination Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House is turning on some
election-year, Rose Garden charm to celebrate President Reagan's
signing of a bill that strengthens the government's power to combat
housing discrimination.
   Some 100 congressional leaders, Cabinet officers and other
administration
   officials were scheduled to gather today at the White House to
witness the presidential signing ceremony.
   The effort is seen as a boon to the White House aspirations of
Vice President George Bush, whose staff was described as helping
forge a compromise on the measure.
   But members of both parties, however, had rushed to become
co-sponsors of the measure after the president signaled his
willingness to sign it into law.
   The original fair housing law, passed in 1968 after the
assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., gave the federal
government only a mediation role in settling housing disputes.
   Under the new law, the secretary of housing and urban
development is empowered to go to court to seek stiff fines against
property owners accused of discrimination.
   The bill received final congressional approval in early August,
before Reagan left on his traditional three-week summer vacation.
However, the legislation's transfer to the White House was delayed
so that a signing ceremony could be held after Reagan's return to
Washington last week.
   The measure gives the federal government its first significant
powers to combate housing discrimination.
   The handicapped and families with children under 18 would be
protected for the first time from housing discrimination. The
current law covered discrimination against racial minorities and
legislation signed into law in 1974 barred discrimination on the
basis of sex.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a chief sponsor, hailed the new
legislation as giving the government ``a tough remedy'' against
housing discrimination.
   Specter credited Bush's staff with being ``very active'' in
negotiating compromise language that helped bring the bill to the
floor.
   Other primary sponsors of the bill included Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y.
   Opponents of the measure, such as Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho.,
had criticized the measure as ``unfair housing bill,'' contending
it intruded on property rights and increased costs due to
accessibility requirements for the handicapped and disabled.
   Other major provisions of the bill include:
   _The secretary of housing and urban development would try to win
a conciliation agreement after a complaint is filed. If that effort
fails, the secretary or any party could take the case to an
independent administrative law judge in HUD or to U.S. District
Court.
   _If the administrative judge finds that someone has engaged or
is about to engage in a discriminatory practice, he shall order
appropriate relief, which may include actual damages, an injunction
or civil penalties.
   _The maximum fines would be $10,000 for a first violation,
$25,000 for a second violation in a five-year period and $50,000
for two or more violations within a seven-year period.
   _New buildings with four or more units must be constructed to
they are readily accessible to the handicapped. Doors must be wide
enough to accommodate wheelchairs; switches and outlets must be in
accessible locations; bathroom walls must be reinforced to allow
later installation of grab bars. This would apply to dwellings set
for occupancy 30 months after the law's enactment.
   _Children could be barred from housing intended for the elderly.
Such housing is defined as a community where at least 80 percent of
the dwellings are occupied by at least one person age 55 or older,
and significant facilities and services are provided; or those
occupied solely by people age 62 and older.

<HEAD>Soviet Leader Gets Second Day Of Complaints From Siberians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the second day in a row, Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev faced complaints today from Siberians angry about
housing, food shortages and medical care.
   After Gorbachev told workers at a synthetic fiber factory that
the ruling Politburo he heads was asked to turn special attention
to a shortage of kindergartens, a voice rang out:
   ``We have kindergartens. We don't have housing, and the medical
facilities are bad,'' the Tass news agency quoted one worker as
shouting to Gorbachev at the Khimvolokno plant in the Siberian city
of Krasnoyarsk.
   On Monday, Gorbachev heard similar complaints when he stopped in
a tiny village, Yemelyanovo, on his way to Kransoyarsk from the
airport to which he had flown from Moscow.
   ``We have no hot water. You do what you can to wash,'' one man
shouted at the 57-year-old Communist Party chief.
   Usually, Soviet citizens politely praise Gorbachev and his
policies or ask mild questions when he stops for chats as he tours
the vast country. But Gorbachev came back from a six-week vacation
to a street-side discussion in Yemelyanovo and at the Krasnoyarsk
factory filled with complaints about food and living conditions.
   The evening television news program Vremya led its Monday
evening program with a report of about 20 minutes on Gorbachev's
trip to the city about 2,000 miles east of Moscow. It included the
acrimonious exchange in Yemeleyanovo.
   As a crowd pressed closer and closer to Gorbachev and his wife,
Raisa, shouting complaints and questions, the general secretary cut
in: ``OK, comrades, I got caught your drift.''
   The Soviet leader blamed local and national officials for
failing to develop social services in Krasnoyarsk, and reiterated
that he is committed to providing each Soviet family with a
separate apartment by the year 2000.
   But some in the crowd were not satisfied.
   ``There will never be that,'' said one man, apparently referring
to the planned individual housing.
   Another man doubted the discussion would be covered by the
officially controlled media.
   ``Mikhail Sergeyevich, will everything be shown on television or
will half be cut out?''
   ``All of it will be shown,'' the Soviet leader responded.
   One of the most vocal of the crowd members, a blond-haired man
in his 20s, began the complaints by shouting about poor management
of a local grain storage facility.
   Gorbachev asked for support for his reform policies as residents
complained about long lines for meat, sausage and other foods, as
well as a lack of hot water.
   ``The most important thing is that you believe in our politics
and in the leadership that is still being formed. It's still being
formed at the regional and provincial levels,'' Gorbachev said.
   He told the group that he was not interested in blind faith, but
in reasoned trust for his policies and the people implementing them.
   ``We're on the right path, comrades,'' he said. ``No need to get
lost. We're on the right path.''
   Today, Gorbachev stopped at Khimvolokno, which Tass said was a
factory key to improving the supply and quality of consumer goods.
The plant is now under reconstruction because it, as well as
associated facilities, are old.
   ``Social development has chronically lagged: housing, schools
and hospitals. Now we must together restore that which we lost
during those long years,'' Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   Tass said Gorbachev would stay in the Krasnoyarsk region, which
occupies one-tenth of the Soviet Union, until the end of the week.
   Krasnoyarsk also is the site of a Soviet radar station that the
United States says is an obstacle to arms control negotiations.
Gorbachev did not discuss the radar site in comments distributed by
the Tass news agency and shown on Soviet television.
   He had been out of public view since July 30, when he met with
the West German foreign minister. Soviet officials said he had been
on vacation.

<HEAD>Flight Engineer Says Hamadi Was Joyful Over Stethem's Blood</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates throughout with additional quotes. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The flight engineer of TWA jet
hijacked in 1985 testified today that Mohammed Ali Hamadi
``joyfully pointed'' to the blood of a murdered U.S. hostage and
indicated his death was a great victory for the hijackers' cause.
   Flight engineer Benjamin Zimmermann said the hijackers beat him
and passengers after the Athens to Rome flight was seized June 14,
1985. He said he was kicked and pistol-whipped.
   ``I would be hit on the side of the head with the gun butt. When
I would bend forward the blows would go down my back,'' Zimmermann
testified.
   The Arab hijackers forced the jetliner to fly to Beirut and held
39 Americans hostage for 17 days. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem
was shot and killed during the ordeal. During the hijacking, the
jet first flew to Beirut, then to Algeria, and then back to Beirut.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is on trial on charges of air
piracy and murder.
   Zimmermann, of Cascade, Idaho, said Hamadi proudly pointed to
Stethem's blood on the jet's fuselage as he and Hamadi walked
around the plane when it landed in Algiers from Beirut.
   ``When we went around the front, the nose of the airplane, Mr.
Hamadi joyfully pointed to the blood running down the door. And
with the pistol he pointed _ he indicated _ he was very proud of
this gun and of him having caused this,'' Zimmermann testified.
   ``He seemed to be demonstrating that he was capable of being a
worthy soldier of the cause for some revolution,'' Zimmermann added.
   Zimmermann did not describe the cause. However, Hamadi testified
earlier in the trial his cause was ``the fight against Israel and
its allies,'' including the United States. The hijackers had
demanded the release of Shiite Moslems held by Israel.
   After the hijacking, Israel freed 700 Lebanese, mostly Moslems,
from prison camps in Israel.
   Under questioning from chief judge Reiner Mueckenberger,
Zimmermann said he was ``absolutely'' certain about the events that
occurred outside the plane.
   The judge indicated Hamadi denied the incident took place.
   Zimmermann said the flight crew tried to keep the plane in
Algiers for as long as possible. He said that as part of a stalling
action, he and Hamadi left the plane to inspect the engines.
   ``Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything wrong with airplane,
at least nothing noticeable to Mr. Hamadi,'' Zimmermann said.
   Zimmermann said he was stunned by Hamadi's behavior as they
observed the blood.
   ``I wondered how he expected me to respond to him. It was as if
he wanted congratulations. It seemed to be a great moment to him,
what that blood represented to him,'' Zimmermann said.
   He also described the events that led up to Stethem's shooting.
   Zimmermann said that when negotiations for fuel with the tower
in Beirut went too slowly, Hamadi shouted ``Get up! Get up!'' to
Stethem.
   The flight engineer said both hijackers then left the cockpit.
   ``I heard a pop. I heard someone exhale very loudly. I heard it
above the engine noises. The shock of that noise was added to by
the co-pilot on the radio stating that we needed fuel because they
were killing passengers,'' Zimmermann testified.
   The TWA pilot, John Testrake, testified Monday that he believed
Hamadi shot Stethem because the defendant seemed to enjoy violence.
The pilot said he did not see Hamadi pull the trigger and said both
hijackers may have been with Stethem when the American was killed.
   Hamadi has admitted being one of the hijackers, but has denied
killing Stethem.
   Also today, Mueckenberger expressed relief that a West German
businessman was released Monday after 20 months of captivity in
Lebanon.
   ``I am extremely relieved that Mr. (Rudolf) Cordes has been
released,'' the judge said. ``This happy news means an end to
endless speculation about what influence Cordes' captivity would
have on these proceedings.''
   Mueckenberger said ``outside elements'' had never influenced the
court, adding: ``It is not the job of the court to conduct
diplomacy.''
   Cordes and another West German, Alfred Schmidt, were kidnapped
in Beirut in January 1987 in the week after Hamadi was arrested at
Frankfurt Airport with explosives in his luggage.
   Hamad's older brother, Abbas Hamadi, was convicted by a
Duesseldorf court of helping kidnap Schmidt and Cordes in a bid to
free his brother.
   Schmidt was released Sept. 7, 1987 in what his kidnappers said
was a ``good will gesture.''
   In Beirut, Cordes' pro-Iranian captors said his release was
linked to Mohammed Hamadi. In a statement, the captors said that if
Hamadi's release cannot be gained legally, ``then we shall be
obliged to again resort to violence.''

   U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Vernon A.
Walters today called for an U.N. investigation of Iraq's alleged
use of chemical weapons against ethnic Kurds.
   In London, the British Foreign Office joined the U.S. call,
asking the United Nations to send a team to Iraq to look into
allegations that gas was used against the Kurds, most of whom live
in northern Iran and Iraq and eastern Turkey.
   Herbert S. Okun, the second-ranking diplomat at the U.S. Mission
to the United Nations, met Monday with Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar to make the request, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Mission said today in New York.
   Okun acted on behalf of the United States, Britain, Japan and
West Germany, said the spokeswoman, who requested anonymity.
   Walters said the United States ``is extremely concerned about
chemical warfare'' and backed a recent unanimous resolution by the
U.N. Security Council condemning its use.
   ``We now have a case before us in the use of chemical warfare by
the Iraqis against the Kurds and I believe that we will have to ..
. ask the (U.N.) secretary-general to investigate this as he
investigated the previous allegations'' against Iraq.
   ``The United States is determined that the use of chemical
warfare will not become an accepted part of regional conflicts. It
is a danger in its own way as great as nuclear warfare and we
intend to stop the proliferation of chemical warfare.''
   The British Foreign Office said it toughened its stand Monday
partly because of U.S. State Department evidence of such attacks,
which led the Senate on Friday to vote for tough economic sanctions
against Iraq.
   The measure still must be approved by the House and signed by
President Reagan.
   Iraq has denied the charges.
   British official sources have acknowledged a reluctance by
Britain and other Western European countries to accuse Iraq for
fear, they said, of upsetting the delicate cease-fire in the
8-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
   The British Foreign Office maintained Monday it had altered its
stance also because of other evidence, including reports from
Western journalists in Turkey, where thousands of Iraqi Kurds, many
suffering chemical injuries, have fled.
   The Kurds claim Iraq used the chemical weapons as part of a
bloody offensive against the Kurds, who are seeking autonomy from
Iraq.
   About 60,000 Kurds recently fled Iraq to Turkey, citing poison
gas attacks.
   In Tunis, Tunisia today, the Arab League said charges that Iraq
has used chemical weapons were ``fallacious'' and marked
unwarranted interference in Iraq's internal affairs.
   In a statement issued at its headquarters, the organization
denounced what it called ``an Israeli-American media campaign''
against Iraq.
   In Cairo, meanwhile, Egypt criticized the Senate sanctions,
which a Foreign Ministry official contended were groundless. The
official cited a Turkish Anatolia News Agency report claiming there
was ``no case proving Iraq used these banned weapons.''
   Turkey said Friday no evidence of the use of chemical weapons
was found while screening sick and injured refugees.
   Walters is touring Asia to discuss issues to come up at the 43rd
session of the U.N. General Assembly to convene in New York on
Sept. 20.
   He is leaving on Wednesday for Mongolia on the first visit ever
by a member of the U.S. Cabinet to that landlocked Soviet-bloc
country.
   Walters said he would meet the foreign minister and other senior
officials during his one-day visit to Ulan Bator, the capital of
Mongolia.
   The United States and Mongolia established diplomatic relations
in January 1987.
   While in China, Walters met with Vice Premier Wu Xueqian and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. After visiting Mongolia he is to fly
to South Korea, where he will be chief of the U.S. Delegation to
the Summer Olympic Games in Seoul.

   The U.N.-mediated peace talks between Iran and
Iraq will move to New York next week in what could be a prelude to
the withdrawal of forces from the war zone, Iran's foreign minister
said today.
   The minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said U.N. mediator Jan
Eliasson asked the two delegations to come to New York City on
Sept. 22 during a 20-minute face-to-face meeting today between the
two enemies.
   ``We accepted,'' Velayati said. ``We hope that in New York we
could finalize the timetable which starts with the withdrawal of
the forces to the internationally recognized borders.''
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq, the first to emerge after
the formal session, declined to speak to reporters.
   In another development, Iran released 72 wounded or sick Iraqi
prisoners of war who were flown home under the auspices of the
International Committee of the Red Cross, the organization reported.
   The Red Cross said the repatriation of the 72 Iraqis Monday was
``the result of a unilateral decision by the Iranian authorities
and was not connected with the release'' of all POWs as called for
under the U.N. cease-fire resolution.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iran now has
released 775 Iraqi war prisoners since the U.N.-sponsored
cease-fire went into effect Aug. 20.
   Red Cross figures show 613 Iranian prisoners have been
repatriated.
   The organization has registered 50,182 POWs in Iranian camps and
19,284 in Iraqi camps, but a U.N. report released last week
estimated that Iran may be holding up to 70,000 war prisoners and
Iraq about 35,000.
   Iran and Iraq went to war in September 1980.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar presided over the
first week of negotiations that began last month between Iran and
Iraq and then appointed Eliasson as his personal representative.
   Iraq is demanding sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab estuary
that is its only waterway access to the Persian Gulf and that the
outlet be cleared of sunken ships and silt.
   Iran's priorities include the withdrawal of both side's troops
to internationally recognized borders, the exchange of war
prisoners and a U.N. investigation to determine who started the war.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George
Bush are running neck and neck in a pair of newly released national
polls.
   A CNN-USA Today survey of 1,260 certain voters, released Monday,
found 48 percent preferred Bush compared with 46 percent who
favored Dukakis. But the margin of error of 3 percentage points
negates the GOP lead.
   A second poll, conducted Sept. 8-10 by the Roper Organization,
gave Dukakis the lead, 49 percent to 43 percent. Once again, the 5
percent margin of error meant the lead could fall either way.
   The Roper poll, done for Maryland Public Television and released
Monday night, surveyed 619 likely voters nationwide.
   The CNN-USA Today poll, conducted last week by the Gordon Black
Corporation, also suggested that the gender gap has narrowed
considerably with women opting for Dukakis over Bush by a 47-45
margin. Fifty-one percent of men polled preferred Bush, however,
compared with 45 percent for Dukakis.
   Bush's choice of Dan Quayle for his vice presidential nominee
hurt him among swing voters and independents, according to the
poll, but left Republicans unswayed as a whole.
   Another group receiving considerable attention this year, Reagan
Democrats, gave Bush a slight edge over Dukakis, 50-43 percent. But
negative voting seemed to favor Dukakis with 34 percent of Dukakis
supporters voting against Bush and 20 percent of Bush backers
saying they were in effect voting against Dukakis.
   The poll concluded that swing voters will have a substantial
impact on the outcome of the presidential election.
   It hinted at soft support among voters on both sides, with one
in six backing either candidate saying the other could do something
to change their minds. A full fifth of those questioned said they
weren't very committed to either candidate or had not decided who
to vote for.

   A Bay Area Rapid Transit District manager
could face 33 years in prison and a $1 million fine after pleading
guilty to accepting kickbacks over a three-year period from
undercover FBI agents.
   Arnold Flores, 45, who entered the plea Monday on four felony
charges, also could have to return nearly $16,000 in kickbacks.
Sentencing is scheduled on Dec. 12.
   It was the first guilty plea to result from the FBI's
investigation of corruption in contracts involving the three-county
commuter train system. The three-year probe was made public last
month.
   Charges are pending against two other midlevel managers and a
private contractor. Transit system officials say they are
investigating about 20 other managers.
   The FBI says it set up five companies as fronts to do
maintenance for BART and offer kickbacks to managers in exchange
for preferential treatment on contracts.

   Republican George Bush today promised a new era
of individual ``economic empowerment'' and urged voters to reject
Democrat Michael Dukakis' vision of ``an America shackled to the
mistakes of the past.''
   The vice president criticized ``prophets of pessimism'' who he
accused of ignoring the fruits of eight years of President Reagan's
economic policies _ lower interest rates and inflation and creation
of nearly 18 million jobs since 1982.
   ``Americans at every income level are certifiably better off
than they were in 1981,'' Bush told the Executives' Club of
Chicago. ``So the next time somebody tells you that America is
declining, tell 'em to put away the 1980 calendar. This is 1988.
America is a rising nation again.''
   The GOP nominee offered a ``flexible freeze'' on government
spending without any tax increases and _ borrowing a phrase from
former Democratic presidential contender Jesse Jackson _ ``economic
empowerment'' for the individual rather than government controls.
   ``The strength of our economy comes from the people, not from
the government, from the creativity and initiative of the
individual, not from official directives, five-year plans and
so-called industrial policies,'' he said.
   ``Let's remember that today, when the prophets of pessimism are
again heard in the land. The jobs, say the pessimists, they're not
good enough. The trends, say the pessimists, they're worrisome. The
international competition, say the pessimists, it's too tough,''
Bush said.
   He accused Dukakis of espousing a big government philosophy that
will lead to a growing bureaucracy, less competitive industry ``and
an America shackled to the mistakes of the past.''
   Bush said Dukakis ``is on a magical mystery tour,'' promising to
create a fund to rebuild America with a helping hand from
Washington.
   But the vice president said this helping hand is reaching right
for the voters' wallets.
   ``What will pay for that helping hand? Your money. And who is
being helped? Not you,'' Bush said.
   ``This isn't a helping hand,'' he said. ``This is the same old
heavy hand of government.''
   Bush set the tone for today's speech during appearances SMonday
at a Hispanic-owned food plant in Secaucus, N.J., and a rally at an
Alton, Ill., shopping center.
   Touring the Goya Foods plant, Bush told 100 employees that
Hispanic workers ``have been some of the biggest winners in
America's economic comeback,'' with their jobs increasing at three
times the rate of the entire U.S. labor force.
   At the shopping center, Bush attacked the Democratic
presidential nominee for suggesting that the vice president was
emulating the late Joseph R. McCarthy, the inquisitorial
anti-communist senator who questioned the patriotism of many
Americans in the 1950s.
   At the same time, Bush suggested that he was a friend of the
people and implied that Dukakis wasn't.
   ``He suggested that when I said he's a card-carrying member of
the American Civil Liberties Union, that that was McCarthyism,''
Bush told a crowd of about 7,000 supporters.
   Dukakis actually used the term in reference to Bush's attack on
him for refusing to require teachers to lead their classes in the
Pledge of Allegiance.
   Bush referred to an Aug. 17 New York Magazine article that
quoted Dukakis saying he was a card-carrying member of the ACLU.
   ``He said that, not me,'' Bush said heatedly. ``I am for the
people. He's that. He says he's that.
   ``I am the vice president of the United States of America, a
partner in an administration that has turned this economy around,
that has put America back to work, that has strengthened our
national security and that has enhanced the peace.''
   Earlier Monday, the Bush campaign announced the resignations of
five members of his American Nationalities Coalition, an ethnic
outreach panel made up of volunteer advisers. A newspaper,
Washington Jewish Week, reported last week that a handful of the
group's 88 members had ties to anti-Semitic, Nazi or other fascist
organizations, or were blocking the prosecution of suspected Nazi
war criminals.
   Bush told reporters in Alton that the campaign conducted a
review of allegations made in the newspaper and ``we were unable to
substantiate any of them.''
   `Nonetheless,'' he said, ``these individuals have done the right
thing by removing themselves from the controversy and any further
use by political opponents.''
   He said the five had left voluntarily, and added with visible
annoyance that the campaign: ``We're getting into a very peculiar
deal where some people are accusing people. I don't like it a bit.''
   Those who resigned were Philip Guarino, Laszlo Pastor, Florian
Galdau, Ignatius Bilinsky and Bohdon Fedorak.
   The resignations follow the departure last week of coalition
member Jerome Brentar, who had been an active supprter of John
Demjanjuk, the former Ohio autoworker who was extradited and
convicted in Israel of being a Nazi war criminal.
   On Sunday, Frederic V. Malek resigned as the Bush-appointed
deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee after
acknowledging a newspaper report that while serving in the Nixon
administration, he tallied the number of Jews in a federal agency.

uninhabited house in a Roman Catholic neighborhood of Londonderry,
a spokesman said today.
   ``This was one of the most deadly arsenals of weapons and
bomb-making material ever found in the city,'' said the police
spokesman, who refused to be identified. ``We are concerned about
the possible consequences of such an arsenal of death being stored
in a densely populated area.''
   Londonderry is the province's second largest city.
   He declined to say if police know who owned the cache. No
arrests were made during the search.
   The police spokesman said the arms cache was discovered less
than a mile from the apartment where an Irish Republican Army bomb
killed two civilians on Aug. 31.
   The IRA is fighting to oust the British from Northern Ireland
and unite the province with the Irish Republic.
   Police in the Irish Republic, meanwhile, said that on Monday
night they discovered a hidden underground bunker near the border
containing 79 pounds of bomb-making materials.
   A Dublin police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the bunker was found in a routine search of land near the town
of Dundalk, about a half mile from the border with Northern Ireland.
   He said 18 two-pound packs of nitro-benzine and fertilizer mix
were found in the bunker, which was buried under six inches of
earth and sealed by steel doors. He said it was not known who owned
the bunker.
   Such material has been used in bombs made by the IRA, the
domestic British agency Press Association said.

<HEAD>Postal Employees Return To Work After Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Postal employees began returning to work today
after nearly two weeks of strikes, but officials said it would take
as many weeks to deliver a backlog of 150 million letters and
packages.
   The strike ended Monday night after the Union of Communication
Workers reached an agreement with post office officials. The two
sides said they established a framework for further talks on
differences over pay bonuses, overtime compensation and the hiring
of temporary staff.
   The union, which represents the 140,000 post office employees
involved in the dispute, said it hoped all workers would be back at
work by Thursday.
   About 1,700 workers returned to post offices by mid-morning
today while more than 98,000 other strikers continued negotiations,
Garner said.
   She said workers are on their jobs at Tonbridge and Sevenoaks,
both southeast of London, and in other small offices around the
country.
   Public mailboxes that were sealed during the dispute will be
opened gradually, she said.
   Post office officials said international mail and first-class
letters and parcels will receive priority as the backlog of mail is
cleared over the next two weeks.
   About half of Britain's 1,500 post offices were closed during
the strike, and only one of the 82 major mail sorting centers _ in
Belfast, Northern Ireland _ remained open during the strike.
   Post Office spokeswoman Jane Garner said the agreement condones
the ``use of temporary staff, reasonable levels of overtime (pay)
... and some diversions of mail to offices which can best handle
it.''
   The post office wants to pay bonuses to new workers in London
and southeast England, where the cost of living is high and
recruiting employees is difficult.
   The union, which demanded that the bonuses be paid to all
employees or not at all, called a series of strikes that began with
a 24-hour work stoppage Aug. 31.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis said today the United States should
encourage better Soviet relations but still deal firmly with any
Soviet deception or aggression. Republican George Bush, emphasizing
economic themes, said Americans are better off than when President
Reagan took office.
   Dukakis said of U.S.-Soviet relations, ``We in America should
stand ready to respond to progress with progress. But we must be
ready to meet stubbornness with determination, deception with the
truth and aggression with the full power of a strong and united
democratic alliance.''
   His comments, continuing a week-long emphasis on foreign and
military policy, came one day after he pledged support for the
Stealth bomber, which he said was begun during a Democratic
administration and would be completed during his own.
   Bush, renewing his attack on Dukakis as too liberal for the
presidency, said today in a speech to the Executives' Club in
Chicago that the Democrat supports a big-government philosophy that
will leave ``America shackled to the mistakes of the past.''
   In his remarks, Bush embraced Reagan principles of less
government but also praised the idea of ``economic empowerment,'' a
phrase often used by Jesse Jackson, a Democrat generally considered
more liberal than Dukakis.
   Bush said that in addition to his stands against new taxes and
in favor of a ``flexible freeze'' on government spending, ``the
third principle is economic empowerment. The strength of our
economy comes from the people, not from the government, from the
creativity and initiative of the individual, not from official
directives, five-year plans and so-called industrial policies.''
   Dukakis, in a speech to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations
today, said, ``Yes, it would be naive to take (Soviet leader
Mikhail) Gorbachev at his word, but it would be dangerous to allow
his words to go unanswered and untested in the court of public
opinion around the world.''
   He praised Reagan for the progress his administration has made
on nuclear arms control but said too often the arms-reduction
proposals came from the Soviet Union. And he questioned whether
Bush or his running mate, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, had the judgment
and experience to negotiate with the Soviets.
   ``George Bush has been around Washington a long time but if he
couldn't stand up to the ayatollah or say no to Noriega, how will
he measure up to Gorbachev?'' Dukakis asked.
   Meanwhile, five members of Bush's Coalition of American
Nationalities resigned Monday amid charges of ties to anti-Semitic
organizations. They said in a statement they were leaving ``because
we have been attacked unfairly by George Bush's political
opponents.''
   The resignations come on the heels of Frederic V. Malek's
decision to leave his Republican National Committee post after a
published report said he had compiled a list in 1971 of Jews at the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. Bush had appointed Malek to the RNC job.
   The two presidential candidates were deadlocked in the latest
public opinion poll. A Cable News Network-USA Today survey of 1,260
certain voters, conducted last week by the Gordon Black Corp.,
found 48 percent favored the Republican ticket while 46 percent
preferred the Democratic slate.
   The margin of error of 3 percentage points makes the race a
virtual dead heat.
   A second poll, conducted Sept. 8-10 by the Roper Organization,
gave Dukakis the lead, 49 percent to 43 percent. Once again, the 5
percent margin of error in either direction meant the lead was
uncertain.
   The Roper poll, done for Maryland Public Television and released
Monday night, surveyed 619 likely voters nationwide.
   Stepping up his offensive on Monday, Dukakis issued an unusual
promise to support the Stealth bomber _ a pledge that appeared to
go beyond the candidate's previous statements that he supported
continued research on the project.
   ``That bomber was started by a Democratic administration; it was
supported by the Democrats in Congress, and it's going to be
completed under my administration,'' Dukakis told workers at a
General Electric plant in Ohio.
   The Massachusetts governor encountered boos and chants of
``Bush, Bush,'' from the employees at the plant where engines for
the radar-evading aircraft are manufactured. Those booing were in
the minority and Dukakis' speech was not interrupted.
   At a shopping center rally in Illinois, Bush repeated his charge
that Dukakis is a liberal Democrat and ``card-carrying member'' of
the American Civil Liberties Union _ terms the Democratic nominee
used to describe himself, according to the vice president.
   ``Recently, the governor of Massachusetts accused me of
McCarthyism,'' Bush said. ``And it was suggested that when I said
he is a card-carrying member of the ACLU that that was McCarthyism;
when I say he's a liberal that's ... unfair.''
   Shouting until he was nearly hoarse, Bush said it was Dukakis
himself who said in Iowa, ``I'm a very strong Democrat, a liberal
Democrat ... a progressive Democrat ... a card-carrying member of
the American Civil Liberties Union.''
   At the rally, Bush did not directly respond to Dukakis'
criticism that Republicans were attacking his patriotism, using the
tactics of the late-Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy.
   Earlier in the day, however, in a taped interview with the ``USA
Today'' television program, Bush was asked what question would he
pose to Dukakis and responded: ``Do you think the vice president's
impugned your patriotism? Were you serious when you suggested to
this man who's been in public life for 30 years he is guilty of
McCarthyism?''
   Dukakis, answering Bush in a separate interview, said, ``Oh sure
he has. ... You don't run around suggesting to people that a rival
for the presidency of the United States is less committed to the
Pledge of Allegiance and what it means without impugning his
patriotism.''

   Michael Dukakis said today he would welcome an
expanded Soviet role in world trade if the Kremlin makes
long-awaited progress in guaranteeing human rights, ending regional
conflicts and halting weapons shipments to terrorist nations.
   The Democratic nominee, promising a hard-line approach on
U.S.-Soviet relations, also questioned whether Republican
candidates George Bush and Dan Quayle are tough enough to deal with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``George Bush has been around Washington a long time but if he
couldn't stand up to the Ayatollah or say `no' to (Panamanian
leader Gen. Manuel Antonio) Noriega, how will he measure up to
Gorbachev?'' Dukakis asked.
   ``And if he truly believes that J. Danforth Quayle is qualified
to be one heartbeat away from the presidency, how can we trust his
judgment when America's future is on the line?''
   Dukakis said Quayle paled in comparison to the three vice
presidents who have become president since World War II.
   ``Dan Quayle is no Gerald Ford,'' he said. ``He's no Lyndon
Johnson. And he sure ain't Harry Truman. Can we stake our future on
the hope that he is a match for Mikhail Gorbachev?''
   Dukakis told the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations that the
next president ``must understand the obstacles that exist to an
improved relationship with the Soviet Union, but he must not be put
off by them.''
   He added: ``We must act, not react, if we are to regain and
maintain the initiative in world affairs. Yes, it would be naive to
take Gorbachev at his word, but it would be dangerous to allow his
words to go unanswered and untested in the court of public opinion
around the world.''
   Dukakis said Soviet actions have fallen short of Gorbachev's
words in reforming Soviet society.
   He called on Gorbachev to reduce the Soviet advantage in
conventional forces in Europe and promised a Democratic
administration's cooperation in negotiating further cutbacks in
nuclear weapons.
   Dukakis urged the Soviets not only to help end conflicts in the
Middle East and Nicaragua but to support trade unions and
alternative political parties in Eastern bloc nations.
   ``We must constantly remind the Soviets of the regional conflict
they created in Eastern Europe, a conflict that has resulted in
totalitarian rule over six proud nations for more than 40 years,''
he said.
   While Gorbachev has publicly promised to help curb terrorism,
the Massachusetts governor assailed the Soviets for supplying
military and economic aid to Syria, Libya and the Palestinian
Liberation Organization, and providing nuclear missiles to other
countries.
   ``As president, I will work with our allies to persuade Mr.
Gorbachev that if he wants to join the international economic
community he must first get out of the business of exporting these
weapons to volatile regions of the world,'' Dukakis said.
   He also accused Gorbachev of failing to deliver on his promise
to improve human rights in the Soviet Union. ``It is not enough to
pretend that rights exist when they do not exist,'' Dukakis said.
   ``We, in America, should stand ready to respond to progress with
progress,'' Dukakis said. ``But we must be ready to meet
stubborness with determination, deception with the truth and
aggression with the full power of a strong and united democratic
alliance.''
   It was Dukakis' first major policy speech on Soviet-American
affairs, and was part of a three-day campaign effort to counter
Bush's charges that Dukakis was weak on defense and naive on
foreign policy.
   He began the counteroffensive Monday with an overview of his
views on national security in Philadelphia and later by touring a
General Electric plant outside Cincinnati. He reiterated his
support for the Stealth bomber, whose engines are made at the
plant, but nonetheless was periodically interrupted by booing Bush
supporters.
   ``It was a good audience,'' Dukakis said after the Cincinnati
event, during which he did not acknowledge his detractors. ``It was
fun. That's democracy.''
   From Chicago, Dukakis was heading to Michigan to visit a plant
where the M-1 tank was designed. The Democratic nominee supports
the tank program.
   Dukakis attacked Bush's judgment in light of the resignation of
five Bush campaign officials amid published reports of their past
ties with pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic organizations.
   ``I think it raises continuing questions about Mr. Bush's
judgment,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis, whose own polls show uneasiness among critical swing
voters with Bush's selection of Quayle, also criticized the
Republican senator in his Philadelphia speech. He called Bush a
failed leader in the war on drugs and derided Bush's promise to
appoint Quayle as his point man in the drug fight.
   ``We're going to put someone who is tough and aggressive and
experienced in charge of the war against drugs,'' Dukakis said
after praising his running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen. Dukakis
spoke at a gathering of about 250 people in a Philadelphia union
hall.

   Thirty percent of high-achieving
teen-agers said they have considered committing suicide and 45
percent said they knew someone who had killed themself or had tried
to, a new survey found.
   The 19th annual survey of high achievers, conducted by polling
teen-agers listed in the directory ``Who's Who Among American High
School Students,'' found that 4 percent said they had tried to
commit suicide.
   Since the survey began tracking attitudes toward suicide among
high achievers four years ago, the percentage who reported knowing
a teen-ager who had attempted or committed suicide has grown from
40 percent to 45 percent.
   The percentage who reported having personally considered suicide
has been relatively stable, rising from 28 percent to 30 percent
over the four-year period, while the percentage who report trying
to commit suicide went from 3 percent to 4 percent, the
organization said.
   ``The problem may be especially serious among black high
achievers,'' the organization said in a news release.
   The survey found that 10 percent of the black high-achievers
polled this year said they had attempted suicide. The survey
results were based on responses from 2,024 students, 5 percent of
whom were black, the Who's Who organization said.
   On other issues, the new Who's Who survey found that drug use
continues dropping among the nation's brightest high school
students, with less than 1 percent reporting they smoke marijuana
more than once a month. That's down from 4 percent five years ago
and 11 percent a decade ago.
   Alcohol use also is decreasing, with 63 percent of the
teen-agers surveyed saying they never drink alcohol, compared to 50
percent in 1978 and 48 percent in 1983.
   The news release did not contain a margin of error for the
survey, and Who's Who officials cautioned that it was not designed
to be representative of all teens.
   ``It's important to note these statistics represent high
achievers, not the general teen population,'' said Paul Krouse,
publisher of the directory of high school students.
   He noted that the findings on suicide were lower than those
found in the recent survey by the American Alliance for Health,
Physical Education, Recreation and Dance, which polled a general
teen-age sample.

   Opposition leaders today rejected
elections that would be organized by the country's one-party
government and repeated their call for an interim government to
supervise the vote.
   About 75 students and others, including two Buddhist monks, went
on a 48-hour fast for democracy, reviving a tactic used decades ago
in the struggle for greater freedom from British colonial rule.
   Tens of thousands of people marched in the capital demanding the
interim government. They included striking government employees,
uniformed students and about 3,000 uniformed doctors, nurses and
staff members of militry and other hospitals.
   The demonstrations were smaller than those the day before.
   After weeks of political turmoil, many people in this city of
3.5 million have begun eating rice porridge or gruel instead of
pure rice because prices have skyrocketed due to growing shortages.
   Strikes by transportation workers and a lack of fuel have
restricted supplies from the countryside, and there has been
hoarding by worried residents. A 4.4-pound bag of rice that cost
the equivalent of $1.70 a month ago now costs $5.80.
   Gasoline was selling at $16 a gallon on the black market,
compared to $1 a year ago, a Western diplomat said.
   Opposition leaders Aung Gyi, Aung San Suu Kyi and former Defense
Minister Tin Oo said in their meeting with the government-appointed
election commission that they will not support or take part in the
elections and will continue pressing for an interim government.
   The Burma Socialist Program Party, which came to power in a 1962
military coup, announced Saturday it will end 26 years of one-party
rule and hold elections as early as the end of October.
   They told the commission that polling could not be conducted in
the country's rapidly deteriorating security situation, Aung Gyi
said later.
   Aung Gyi said he told election commission chairman Ba Htay, a
retired financial commissioner under a pre-1962 civilian government:
   ``After 26 years of this rule, most people in the country do not
know you and will not have confidence. More so, people do not trust
any government-appointed commission.''
   Like the other four elderly commission members, Ba Htay is
regarded as politically neutral.
   The three opposition leaders were later joined by a fourth
anti-government figure, former Prime Minister Nu, in a meeting with
student rebel leaders. The students asked them to immediately form
an interim government, but were told that was not possible without
cooperation from the current government.
   On Monday, Aung Gyi, Aung San Suu Kyi, and Tin Oo signed their
first joint statement, a letter to President Maung Maung demanding
the interim government. Photographs of them eating together and
signing the statement received prominent display in private and
government-run newspapers Tuesday, buoying the opposition movement.
   This morning, the group of hunger strikers sat on the road in
front of City Hall, where several anti-government demonstrators
were shot dead by security forces Aug. 8. They began fasting at 9
a.m., looked after by doctors and other sympathizers.
   Gen. Saw Maung, defense minister and armed forces chief of
staff, called for citizens and the military to cooperate in holding
the proposed government-organized general elections.
   The last multi-party elections in Burma were held Feb. 6, 1960,
when former Prime Minister Nu's Clean Anti-Fascist People's Freedom
League won a landslide victory over an army-backed party.
   Gen. Ne Win led the March 1962 coup that toppled Nu, who uses
only one name. The military crushed dissent and pursued rigid
policies that made Burma, once one of Asia's richest countries, one
of the world's poorest nations.
   In September 1987, students stages riots against the
government's economic policies, followed by widespread protests in
March and in June. After Ne Win resigned July 23, the party chose
hardliner Sein Lwin to succeed him. After only 17 days in office,
Sein Lwin was succeded on Aug. 19 by Maung Maung, the first
civilian leader since Nu.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1,500-year-old tomb uncovered on the
northern coast of Peru has yielded one of the richest collections
of crafted gold and artifacts ever found in the Americas, the
National Geographic Society announced today.
   The tomb, officials said, was the burial place for a
warrior-priest of the Moche people, a civilization that dominated
the Peruvian area from 100 A.D. to about the end of the 7th century.
   ``This is the richest tomb ever excavated archaeologically in
the western hemisphere,'' according to Christopher B. Donnan, an
expert on ancient Peru.
   Walter Alva, director of the Bruning Archaeological Museum in
Lambayeque, Peru, said that the area near the village of Sipan may
be the burial site for a succession of high-ranking Moche leaders
and that other tombs with more treasure may be found.
   ``I am sure that when we finish digging here, we will know more
about the life, social and economic organization, the metallurgical
knowledge and religious practices of the Moche,'' Alva was quoted
as saying in an announcement released by the National Geographic
Society.
   Officials said the Moche peoples dominated the Peruvian area
prior to the time of the Inca civilization. The Incas were the most
powerful group in the area at the time of the Spanish conquest in
the 1530s.
   The Moche tomb was discovered after authorities learned in
January 1987, that a number of remarkably fine gold and silver
artifacts were being sold on the black market in Peru. Police
raided the home of a tomb robber and, after a shoot out that killed
one person, recovered some of the treasures.
   Information gathered from the raid led to the Sipan area and the
tomb was found after careful excavation.
   Among the treasures found were a crown, mask, knives and jewelry
of gold, along with more than 1,000 ceramic and copper artifacts.
   In addition to the warrior-priest, the tomb also contained the
remains of two women and three other men, all apparently part of a
ceremonial entombment ritual.
   Excavation of the tomb was financed by the National Geographic
Society under the auspices of the Peruvian government.

   Oil futures prices, which are trading near
two-year lows, could stabilize at higher levels amid speculation
that Saudi Arabia might take the lead in curbing OPEC production,
traders say.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange this morning, prices for
near-term contracts of crude oil opened slightly higher than
Monday's closing prices.
   Crude futures prices had skidded below $14 a barrel Monday but
then surged higher in the final hour of trading after Saudi King
Fahd called for joint cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC
producers in establishing production limits.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude, was trading between $14.50 and $14.58 a 42-gallon barrel in
early trading today, compared with Monday's $14.49 closing price.
Before the late rally Monday, the contract had dropped to $13.75,
the lowest level since oil traded for $13.73 on Oct. 29, 1986.
   Contracts for refined oil products also were trading higher this
morning. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery ranged
between 42.90 cents and 43.50 cents a gallon, compared with
Monday's closing of 42.62 cents. The October wholesale heating oil
contract ranged between 41.80 cents a gallon and 42.05 cents,
compared with Monday's settlement price of 41.68 cents.
   Fahd's statement could indicate Saudi Arabia _ the world's
biggest crude exporter _ was moving to take a leadership role and
lower its own oil production, said George Konikowski, an analyst at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Two years ago when oil prices hit similar lows, Saudi production
curbs helped reverse the market's decline, traders said.
   ``If the king says he doesn't want the market to go much lower
you would think the Saudis would set some limits,'' said Peter
Beutel, an energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc. ``It looks like
prices are going to stabilize in this range.''
   Monday's early selloff was fueled by anxieties about the
continuing world oil glut.
   Analysts said Fahd's statement came as the market was looking
for positive news following a string of negative indicators that
had steadily eroded prices.
   Fahd's statement, reported by the official Saudi Press Agency
following a weekly government Cabinet session, had a strong impact
on the market because the king rarely makes public statement
related to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
brokers said.
   Before the statement was released, analysts had focused on the
inability of OPEC's 13 members to keep within their production
quotas despite the worldwide oversupply of oil.
   After predicting prices could drop below $13 a barrel by week's
end, some analysts reversed their position by the end of Monday's
session, saying such an assessment was now overly pessimistic.
   OPEC members are scheduled to meet in Vienna, Austria, Nov. 21.
   As more oil floods the market, refiners have taken advantage of
the bargain rates to pad their inventories before winter, analysts
said. Normally, refiners build up inventories during the summer
months, but with refineries near capacity, the extra oil is going
into storage rather than refining.
   ``Everyone thinks prices are probably at the lowest they're
going to see through the remainder of the year,'' said Ken Miller,
senior principal and engineer at Purvin & Gertz Inc. petroleum
consulting firm in Houston.

<HEAD>Botha's Visit to Malawi Completes First Summit Trip To Black

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha announced
today that South Africa will donate 3,000 tons of corn to feed
refugees in Malawi, as he completed his first summit trip into
black Africa in his 10 years in power.
   Botha's announcement followed private talks in Mzuzu, Malawi,
with the country's long-serving president, Hastings Kamuzu Banda.
Malawi is the only African state maintaining full diplomatic ties
with South Africa, where whites dominate the government.
   On Monday, Botha had a 90-minute private talk in northwestern
Mozambique with President Joaquim Chissano, whose Marxist
government has accused South Africa of supporting an 11-year-old
rebel insurgency.
   Botha gave assurances to Mozambique that this support had ceased
and invited Chissano to South Africa to continue talks on increased
cooperation.
   The refugees who are to receive the gift of corn in Malawi are
residents of Mozambique who have fled the fighting there.
   In Mzuzu, Botha and Banda issued a joint statement reaffirming
the friendly relations between South Africa and Malawi. Both also
said South Africa would negotiate a rescheduling of Malawi's debt
``on terms agreeable to both parties.''
   Banda, believed to be almost 90, has ruled Malawi in
authoritarian style since independence from Britain in 1964.
Opposition political parties are banned, and Banda maintains
personal control over most government ministries.
   In Mozambique, Botha and Chissano agreed to work at reviving the
1984 Nkomati Accord, in which South Africa pledged to withdraw
support from guerrillas in return for controls on African National
Congress exiles based in Mozambique.
   Mozambique repeatedly has accused South Africa of breaking the
agreement.
   Chissano spoke of mutual hopes to end regional conflicts and
said, ``We are ready to take this process as far as possible.''
   Mozambique in the past has accused Malawi of allowing the
Mozambican rebels to operate from its territory. Relations between
the two countries have improved since Malawi agreed last year to
deploy troops in Mozambique to help protect a railroad line against
sabotage.

<TEXT>
   The sister of America's longest-held
hostage in Lebanon says she is pushing for a United Nations
resolution condemning international kidnapping by extremist groups.
   Peggy Say said during a news conference Monday that her brother
Terry Anderson will celebrate his 41st birthday Oct. 27, and she
would like to see the resolution passed on that date.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, by a pro-Iranian group in
Moslem West Beirut.
   Say said she and the Journalists' Committee to Free Terry
Anderson are also attempting to arrange an appearance by former
French hostages on the ``Donahue'' television talk show.
   Say said she has deliberately been quiet in recent months since
moving from Batavia to Kentucky, hoping that the lack of media
attention might bear some positive developments in her brother's
release.
   ``I have to believe the end is near,'' Say said. ``It could be a
logical assumption that he could be here by the end of the year.''
Prospects appear more promising because of negotiations to end the
war between Iran and Iraq, she said.
   After his release by the Islamic Jihad earleir this year, French
national Marcel Fontaine met with Say and told her of her brother's
condition. That meeting produced the last reliable information
about Anderson, Say said.
   Say said she believes the Reagan administration has negotiated
vigorously for the release of other American hostages _ such as
during the hijacking of the TWA jetliner to Beirut in 1985 _ but
not for Anderson.
   ``I don't see the administration doing anything now,'' she said.
``What we're being told is to devalue these hostages.''

<HEAD>Panel Says Redesigned Booster Appears Safe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A committee that has been looking over NASA's
shoulder as the space shuttle booster rockets were redesigned said
today it is satisfied no safety issues stand in the way of a launch
late this month or early in October.
   The report, however, disclosed for the first time that a crack
had been found in a strut among stored booster parts and that ``the
implications of the occurrence of this defect'' on the upcoming
flight ``are being evaluated.''
   But the committee, in a report to NASA Administrator James C.
Fletcher, said, ``We have no basis for objection to the current
launch schedule for STS-26,'' the next flight.
   The report was submitted by H. Guyford Stever, chairman of the
National Research Council's panel on the redesign of the shuttle
booster rockets. A leak in the joint between the bottom two of the
four segments that make up the booster was blamed for the
Challenger disaster.
   ``During the redesign activity, two booster components were
found to have structural safety factors that did not satisfy
specifications,'' the report said. A redesigned aft skirt on the
booster ``has failed to meet the ultimate design load condition
required in the specifications,'' the report said, but will not
affect flight safety.
   The other problem is the cracked strut that was found among
stored parts.
   ``We understand that the struts installed in STS-26 had been
inspected in accordance with procedures and proof tested and that
the implications of the occurrence of this defect for STS-26 are
being evaluated,'' Stever wrote.
   Top space agency managers are meeting at the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida for a flight readiness review today and
Wednesday. Presumably this was an issue on the agenda.
   The NRC committee's report was the seventh since it was assigned
the task of monitoring the shuttle's return to flight but was not
as critical as others have been.
   The committee said the five design features thought to have
contributed to the Challenger explosion have been fixed. But the
panel said it was ``disappointed to learn'' of NASA's money-saving
decision to evaluate the redesign with special instrumentation on
only the first three flights.
   ``While not every test that the panel and others might have
desired was conducted before the return to flight, it is clear that
the current test program has been considerably more extensive and
thorough than the test program that preceded the first shuttle
launch,'' the NRC said.
   ``As a consequence, we conclude that NASA can have
commensurately more confidence in the redesigned SRM (solid rocket
motor) than it had in the original design.''

   Jim and Tammy Bakker and a former aide
took money out of PTL and were indifferent to the ministry's
financial woes, a PTL attorney says.
   In a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing expected to last all week,
PTL representatives are trying to regain $52 million they contend
the Bakkers and former aide David Taggart took through
mismanagement of funds, cash advances on PTL credit cards and
unjustified compensation, benefits and fees.
   As the trial began Monday, PTL attorney Brad Leggett said the
Bakkers and Taggart were uninterested in money problems ``while
taking money out at times faster than it was coming in.''
   Peter Bailey, an accountant and financial director at PTL from
June 1979 through July 1987, testified he routinely warned Bakker
of financial troubles.
   Bailey testified today that he was continually frustrated by a
``lack of financial integrity'' on the part of Bakker and other
ministry executives. Memos regarding cost reductions and a limit of
expenditures were either ignored or inadequately addressed, he
charged.
   Bakker lawyer Ryan Hovis told Judge Rufus Reynolds, who is
hearing the case without a jury, that the continuing financial
crisis PTL experienced under Bakker's leadership was not unusual.
   ``Every ministry of this type in the nation had the same type of
financial crisis,'' he said.
   The Bakkers and Taggart were not in court Monday or today, but
Hovis told reporters he plans to call them as witnesses when it is
time to present their case.
   Meanwhile, bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton filed papers
in court saying he couldn't meet Monday's deadline to recommend a
buyer for the ministry's assets. He asked for an extension until
Sept. 27 to continue negotiations.
   In court Monday, PTL lawyers maintained that the Bakkers took
huge personal bonuses while bills weren't being paid, and used
money that was raised to build hotels as general operating funds.
   Entered into court records were numerous memos from Bailey to
Bakker recommending such things as cutting expenses, reducing
payroll and using competitive bidding for construction jobs.
   Bailey said some staff members were hesitant to approach Bakker
with information about financial problems. ``He (Bakker) was out
there planning and building, and he had a saying _ he didn't want
to hear any bad news,'' Bailey said.
   PTL lawyers used internal documents to detail the ministry's
problems from 1984-1987. They cited bonuses given to the Bakkers
and Taggart at the same time the ministry was having serious
financial problems.

   A third of American adults questioned in a
recent survey said they personally know a teen-ager who either
committed suicide or tried to, according to a report released today.
   A separate study of high-achieving teen-agers, meanwhile,
disclosed that 30 percent said they have considered suicide and 45
percent know someone who has tried it, or succeeded.
   The national survey of 1,000 adults, questioned by the National
Association of Private Psychiatric Hospitals, found that 27 percent
of those questioned said they knew a teen-ager who had tried to
kill themselves and 17 percent knew a teen-ager who had killed
themselves.
   Charles Riter of Riter Research, the Annapolis, Md. company that
conducted the survey, said there was overlapping and that a net of
32 percent of those questioned knew a teen-ager in one of the two
categories.
   John E. Meeks, a child psychiatrist and a professor at George
Washington University School of Medicine in Washington, said the
study was ``reassuring'' in the sense it showed adults realize that
modern teen-agers face severe problems.
   ``Teen-agers frequently worry that adults don't take their
problems seriously,'' Meeks said at a news conference.
   Entitled ``Teen-agers at Risk: an Adult Perspective,'' the
survey also found that 72.4 percent of those interviewed think
teen-agers today face far more serious problems than they did at
the same age.
   The survey commissioned by the Washington-based organization
also found that adults focused on three major areas of concern when
asked about 10 specific problems facing adolescents: drug abuse,
alcohol abuse and peer pressure.
   Slightly more than 87 percent said drug abuse was an
``overwhelming'' concern, alcohol abuse was second and peer
pressure third.
   Unwanted pregnancy ranked fourth with 70.8 percent.
   A cluster appeared around the next five areas: Child abuse, 56
percent; crime among teen-agers, 54 percent; depression 53 percent;
conflict with parents 53 percent; and suicide 53 percent.
   The 10th greatest concern was runaway behavior at 44.5 percent.
   Notwithstanding the concern expressed for America's youth, 47
percent of those questioned agreed that when a teen-ager is
admitted to a psychiatric hospital ``it puts a cloud over this
person's head for the rest of his@her life.''
   And 86.3 percent agreed to some degree that ``families find it
difficult to admit that their children need professional
psychiatric help.''
   Of those questioned, 17.1 percent had teen-age children and 31.5
percent had children under 12. Grandparents represented 30.7
percent of the sample.
   The survey of high-achieving teen-agers was conducted by polling
youths listed in the directory ``Who's Who Among American High
School Students.''
   Four percent of the 2,024 respondents said they had actually
attempted suicide.
   It was the fourth year for that study. During that period the
share who said they knew someone who has tried suicide rose from 40
percent to 45 percent; those considering it were up from 28 percent
to 30 percent, and those who tried edged up from 3 percent to 4
percent.

<HEAD>Stowaway's Parents Say She Was Sexually Abused on U.S. Navy Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Irish teen-ager who stowed away on a U.S.
Navy destroyer was sexually abused and supplied with drugs while
detained against her will on the ship for 10 days, an attorney for
the girl's parents said.
   John and Christine Twomey, parents of Suzanne Twomey, wrote
Margaret Heckler, U.S. ambassador to Ireland, that they plan legal
action against the United States for alleged conduct that ``may
have amounted to kidnapping.''
   Navy spokesmen Lt. Cmdr. John Lloyd said Monday, ``We don't have
anything to substantiate a charge of kidnapping.'' But he declined
to comment on the drug or sex abuse allegations.
   Miss Twomey, 17, was found aboard the destroyer Conyngham on
July 22, a day before it reached its home port, Norfolk. The girl
apparently had slipped aboard on July 12 while the ship was in
Cork, Ireland, and was concealed by several crewmen, officials said.
   Four Conyngham sailors face October courts-martial on charges of
aiding and harboring an alien. Four others face an administrative
hearing on less serious charges.
   Raymond O'Neill, an attorney in Cork for the Twomeys, wrote Ms.
Heckler that the teen-ager's stay aboard the Conyngham was
``unlawful, against her will, involuntary and might have amounted
to kidnapping.''
   ``It appears that during the course of her unlawful detention
Ms. Twomey was, on a number of occasions, supplied with narcotics
and, in addition, was repeatedly sexually abused,'' O'Neill said.
   The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star of Norfolk quoted an
unidentified Navy official as saying that Miss Twomey apparently
intended to ride on the ship, because she boarded it herself with a
bag containing clothes, books and a radio or cassette player.
   Irish officials have said that Miss Twomey has run away from
home several times, once to Spain. She is now under the care of
Irish health officials, who said they applied for custody ``in the
interests of the girl herself and after consultation with her
parents and the police.''

   Police launched stun grenades into a
home, then stormed it early today to end a 10-hour stand-off with a
gunman who had sprayed the neighborhood with hundreds of rounds of
ammunition.
   Police said Walter Kumpel, 56, was not holding hostages but he
refused to surrender, despite numerous pleas from police who took
cover to escape the barrage of fire. No one was injured, but dozens
of nearby residents were evacuated.
   Officers found Kumpel barricaded in a back bedroom clutching two
handguns. The man did not fire on the officers, police said.
   Authorities said Kumpel and his wife had been having marital
problems in recent weeks. ``He was acting erratic. ... He was
threatening to kill himself and his family,'' said Police Chief
Steven Rhoads.
   The ordeal in this south suburb of Chicago started about 4:10
p.m. when neighbors called to say the man was threatening to kill
himself and others, police said. Officers were able to get the
man's wife and daughter away from the home before the man started
firing, police said.
   Authorities said they waited for 10 hours before entering the
home because they feared the house was booby trapped, a fear they
later said was unfounded.

<TEXT>
   A judge ruled that only limited
discussion will be allowed in the jury's presence about the sexual
history of a 19-year-old woman whose complaint of a gang rape led
to the indictment of 10 men on charges ranging from kidnapping to
sexual assault.
   After lengthy pre-trial motions by defense attorneys, jury
selection finally began late Monday and continued today in the
sexual assault trial of Orlando Garza, 23, the first of several
scheduled as a result of the woman's allegations.
   State District Judge Ricardo Garcia granted a prosecution motion
to block references to the woman's sexual history in the presence
of the jury without first determining whether such discussion would
be admissible evidence.
   Defense attorney Albert Pena protested that prior sexual
behavior ``touches on the very basis of the defense of consent.''
   Pena told the jury pool they would have to ignore the extensive
media coverage the case has attracted since the 19-year-old woman
said she was abducted and gang raped March 26.
   The woman told authorities she was abducted while walking home
from a relative's house and raped over four hours by as many as 20
men. She said the attack began at a ranch north of town where a
cockfight was being held, and that her attackers urged men at the
cockfight to join in. Some did, despite her pleas of help, she said.
   Ten men were indicted on various kidnapping or sexual assault
charges. A 14-year-old youth also has been charged.
   Garza, of San Diego, also faces a later trial on a charge of
aggravated kidnapping.
   The judge denied motions by the defense to replace the jury
panel. The defense had tried to show that an inordinate number of
the potential jurors were relatives of one of the prosecutors and
residents of areas the county where the prosecutor's family has a
``historical political stronghold.''

<TEXT>
   The escape trial of a reputed drug lord
whose recapture touched off riots in Honduras was headed into its
final stages after just one hour of testimony.
   With extra security guards posted outside U.S. District Court,
closing arguments were scheduled today in the trial of Juan Ramon
Matta, 43, who faces charges of escaping from the Federal Prison
Camp at Eglin Air Force Base in 1971. His trial opened Monday.
   Matta was serving a three-year sentence at the air base in the
Florida Panhandle for illegally entering the United States. He
allegedly slipped out the back door of a chapel at the
minimum-security prison during church services.
   Evidence was covered in only an hour of testimony after a
12-member jury was selected Monday. Defense lawyer Martin Stolar
produced evidence that shortly before he left the prison, Matta had
been told his mother was ill.
   Stolar had also challenged the escape charge on grounds Matta
was illegally seized, but his argument was rejected by U.S.
District Judge Roger Vinson.
   Honduran police captured Matta on April 5, using helicopters to
raid his home. Police then put him on a flight to the Dominican
Republic, which in turn put him on a flight for New York City,
where U.S. marshals arrested him.
   His return to the United States touched off rioting in
Tegucigalpa, Honduras, by students, leftists and others who
contended the extradition was barred by the Honduran constitution.
Several protesters were killed and the U.S. Consulate was burned.
   At the time of his arrest in April, Matta had been living openly
in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, since 1986 when he escaped from a
Colombian prison, where he had been held on charges involving the
Medellin drug cartel.
   Authorities said Matta also was wanted for questioning in the
1985 slaying of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique
Salazar in Mexico.

   Britain expelled the Cuban ambassador and another
envoy today after the junior diplomat wounded one man when he fired
a gun at people he believed were following him.
   With a wry smile and a wave, Ambassador Oscar Fernandez-Mell was
driven from his official residence in north London to catch a
flight to Prague, Czechoslovakia, within the 24-hour expulsion
deadline set by British officials.
   The ambassador, accompanied by his wife and 12-year-old son,
picked up another diplomat, believed to be the gunman, Third
Secretary Carlos Manuel Medina Perez, at the embassy en route to
Heathrow Airport.
   Police said anti-terrorist squad detectives had traced one man
who was slightly injured in the Monday afternoon shooting and added
they were satisfied he ``was not posing a threat to anyone.''
   In a statement, Scotland Yard police headquarters said it would
not release the identify of the injured man, adding the police
inquiry into the shooting was closed.
   Speculation grew about the group that Medina Perez, described as
a commercial attache in the diplomatic list, claimed was stalking
him.
   The British radio reports quoted the Cuban Foreign Ministry as
saying on Havana radio that the expulsion was ``arbitrary and
unjust'' and that Medina Perez was being followed by a Cuban exile
who had tried to get the diplomat to defect.
   The Daily Mail said he believed he was being trailed by an
assassination squad. The Daily Express the group were members of
Britain's MI5 counter-intelligence agency, ``who watch Cuban
diplomats round the clock.''
   It added that Medina Perez said he opened fire in panic because
he thought the group were agents of the government of South Africa,
which supports pro-Western guerrillas who oppose the Cuban-backed
Marxist government of Angola.
   The government acknowledged a shooting incident on Monday but
provided few details.
   In London, a Cuban Embassy spokesman in a radio interview said
the British retaliation was ``excessive,''
   The Foreign Office in a statement retorted, ``We have reacted
appropriately to a totally unacceptable and outrageous action on
the streets of London.''
   The Foreign Office said Medina Perez told police he fired
because he was afraid for his safety. The Foreign Office said he
was released from police custody after he claimed diplomatic
immunity.
   Foreign Office Minister Timothy Eggar summoned Fernandez-Mell to
the Foreign Office after the shooting and told the ambassador that
he and Medina Perez, who also held the embassy post of commercial
attache, were being expelled.
   In a later statement, Eggar called the expulsions ``an
indication of how strongly we feel ... We are not prepared to have
this kind of behavior in the streets of London.''
   The Daily Mail reported said Medina Perez barricaded himself in
the official Cuban apartment after the incident. It said two police
officers negotiated with Medina Perez from an adjacent balcony.
   Press Association said Medina Perez fired up to five shots at a
car with four people inside. It quoted an unidentified witness as
saying she saw the four run away, one holding a blood-soaked
handkerchief to his head.
   British authorities refused comment on the news reports.
   In a nation where ordinary police do not carry guns, weapons
possession by diplomats is a grave issue. It became particularly
sensitive after a gunman fired from the Libyan Embassy during a
protest demonstration in April 1984, killing a British policewoman.
After a police siege, the embassy was shut and diplomatic ties cut.
   On Sunday, Vietnamese Third Secretary Khang Than Nhan left
London, expelled by Britain after the Vietnamese ambassador turned
in a gun he said Khang waved Sept. 4 during a demonstration by
British-based Vietnamese refugees.
   The Vietnamese ambassador first handed over a toy gun but later
returned with a real one and apologized, the Foreign Office said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hoodlums burned down a Roman
Catholic chapel in a slum overnight after six self-proclaimed
killers boasted on government television that they participated in
Sunday's massacre at another church.
   The Chapel of Immaculate Conception in the sprawling Cite Soleil
slum burst into flames at 11 p.m. Monday and burned to the ground.
Reporters who rushed to the scene were chased away by the
arsonists, Radio-Soleil reported.
   One of the men who appeared on television was recognized by a
Radio Metropole reporter at the scene of chapel fire.Empty gasoline
cans littered the area around the chapel.
   The chapel is served by the Rev. Arthur Volel, a Salesian priest
known in Haiti for his work with the poor. The Salesian Fathers
specialize in vocational training.
   A Salesian vocational school was partially damaged on Sunday
when St. Jean Bosco, the church of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
another Salesian priest, was attacked by thugs armed with handguns,
sharpened steel pikes and machetes. The assailants shot, stabbed
and slashed at parishioners and then burned down the church and
several vehicles parked outside.
   Radio Haiti-Inter reported today the casualty toll from Sunday's
massacre had reached six dead and 77 wounded.
   ``The government has committed a genocide on an unarmed people.
It is for the international community to put a stop to it,''
Christian Democratic leader Sylvio Claude declared on Radio
Metropole this morning.
   Five men and a woman spoke on Radio Metropole and Tele-Haiti
Monday afternoon before appearing on Television Nationale, the
government network, and declared they had participated in Sunday's
massacre at Aristide's church.
   The six made no attempt to hide their identity and spoke on the
government-controlled network without apparent fear of reprisal.
   They claimed the violence was related to an internal conflict
within the church and threatened ``a heap of corpses'' at future
Masses.
   ``We were after Father Aristide; what you saw yesterday (Sunday)
was child's play. In whatever parish Father Aristide is accepted, a
heap of corpses will attend that Mass,'' a spokesman for the group
said on the Radio Metropole broadcast.
   Aristide, one of the most popular figures among the poor masses
in this Caribbean nation, regularly has preached against army
atrocities and has led his supporters in street demonstrations.
   The priest has been the target of several assassination attempts.
   During the 9 a.m. Mass on Sunday about 300 people stoned Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide's St. Jean Bosco church in the La Saline
slum. Then two dozen men with guns and machetes burst into the
church began killing people. Soldiers watched from across the
street and did nothing, radio stations and witnesses said. The
assailants then set the church on fire.
   Aristide escaped unhurt and went into hiding.
   Witnesses at the church said they recognized some of the
attackers as city hall employees, but did not identify them.
   Port-au-Prince Mayor Franck Romain, a former colonel in
ex-dictator Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier's presidential guard and
former chief of police under Jean-Claude Duvalier, denied city hall
had been involved, although he said Aristide was ``justly
punished'' in the attack.
   ``If (city) employees were involved ... I don't see how I am
concerned .. I am not someone who preaches violence and who sends
people out to die as Aristide has always done,'' Romain told Radio
Metropole Monday. ``He who sows the wind, reaps the storm.''
   Romain, Port-au-Prince mayor until the younger Duvalier's ouster
on Feb. 7, 1986, returned to that office in army-run elections in
January, and remained after Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy ousted President
Leslie Manigat in a coup on June 19, ending four months of civilian
rule.
   ``His (Romain's) name is well-connected with the worse offenders
of human rights under Duvalier,'' Paul Latortue, a Haitian
economics professor at the University of Puerto Rico and a former
senatorial candidate, told The Associated Press in San Juan Monday.
   Manigat, who lives in the United States, denounced the incident
as the work of Namphy's secret police.
   ``Brute force is the principal instrument of those who now
control the country,'' Manigat said from his home in Maryland.
   Among those injured were a woman and her infant _ both skewered
by the same homemade, steel pike while the baby girl was in her
mother's womb. An operation saved mother and child.
   In Washington, State Department spokeman Charles Redman
condemned the behavior of the police.

   An out-of-control wildfire zeroed
in on hundreds of rural dwellings in the rugged Sierra Nevada today
after leveling nearly 100 homes and forcing the evacuation of at
least 8,000 people.
   The warm, dry winds that drove the fire across 40 square miles
of terrain covered with timber and brush continued this morning as
sleep-starved firefighters struggled to hold their own against the
70-foot-high flames.
   ``We probably have as extreme a condition as anywhere in
California or anywhere in the U.S. today,'' said operations
director Ed Waggoner of the state Department of Forestry.
   At least 149 structures, including 92 homes, were destroyed in
an area about 60 miles northeast of Sacramento, authorities said.
Some of the homes were valued at $1 million.
   Fire officials stressed that many more houses are still in
extreme danger, especially Rough and Ready, a community of about
500 residents _ all evacuated _ in the heavily wooded bottom of a
steep canyon on the edge of the fire.
   Fire planning chief Steve Iverson said saving Rough and Ready
was one of the top priorities today, but he cautioned that it was a
particularly dangerous area for firefighters because of the limited
access on a narrow road.
   ``If we have shifty winds, we're not going to sit around in
there,'' Iverson said.
   A preliminary estimate by the U.S. Forest Service put the loss
in structures alone at more than $9 million, and the figure was
expected to climb much higher.
   ``I was coming back from the Bahamas, sitting in San Francisco
International Airport, and I see my father's house burning on
television,'' said insurance agent Don Sanzone, 41.
   Jim Mowner, a state forestry spokesman, said the continued stiff
winds and low humidity were hampering firefighting.
   ``I would say the fire will burn actively overnight,'' he said
early today.
   Before dawn, Mowner's prediction was borne out, as Department of
Forestry officials reported that the fire had grown overnight from
25 to 40 square miles.
   The only good news, Mowner said, was that the fire was spreading
into an area east of Beale Air Force Base, where there were fewer
homes.
   ``That could help us,'' he said. ``We've been spending an awful
lot of time and manpower protecting structures, so the main fire
has been burning relatively freely.''
   More than 1,000 firefighters had been added to the lines Monday
and today, bringing the total to nearly 2,800 battling the blaze,
said forestry department spokeswoman Karen Finlayson.
   The blaze began early Sunday when a transient set fire to toilet
paper. The unidentified man was cited for burning without a permit
and released, authorities said.
   About 4,500 residents of the affluent Lake Wildwood area were
forced from their homes Sunday and Monday as erratic winds shifted
the blaze. At least 3,500 people have been evacuated from the
nearby communities of Smartville, Rough and Ready, and Penn Valley,
since Sunday.
   Two firefighters suffered second- and third-degree burns. Their
conditions were not immediately available.
   The fire jumped Highway 20 and headed southwest on Monday,
threatening hundreds of scattered, rural dwellings and forcing the
latest round of evacuations.
   ``There are hundreds here and they are pouring in,'' said Red
Cross worker Elizabeth Quirk at the Nevada Union High School
evacuation center. ``The school buses are bringing in senior
citizens, and there are campers and motor homes in the parking
lot.''
   Most schools were closed in the region. Thick smoke made it
unsafe to operate school buses, and the Red Cross converted at
least three schools into temporary evacuation centers.
   By early today, the fire had burned an estimated 25,000 acres,
or nearly 40 square miles, of western Nevada County.
   Flames threatened the high-technology Grass Valley Group, the
county's largest employer with 1,000 workers. The fire reached
three sides of the company's sprawling grounds, and destroyed a
storage shed. The company produces video equipment used at
television stations, and makes special-effects software for
national television broadcasts.
   The Yuba County Board of Supervisors met late Monday in
emergency session to declare the zone a local disaster area, and
expressed concern that the fire may threaten Beale Air Force Base
near Marysville, 20 miles to the west of the fire and the home base
of the SR-71 ``Blackbird'' spy plane.
   The blaze was fueled by drought-dry brush, wood roofs and
exploding propane tanks, said state Department of Forestry
spokesman Charlie Jakobs.
   The greatest concentration of damage was around Lake Wildwood,
where at least 15 homes, five boats and a dock were destroyed.
Nineteen other structures outside of the Lake Wildwood area were
destroyed, including several residential trailers and agricultural
buildings.
   Another fire about 80 miles west of Lake Wildwood in the coast
range of Sonoma County blackened more than 10 square miles,
destroyed several structures and temporarily threatened Pacific Gas
& Electric Co.'s geothermal plants.
   Altogether, almost a dozen fires destroyed nearly 30,000 acres
of timber and brush in California Monday. About 5,000 firefighters
were on fire lines statewide.

   Airlines, already pinched by deregulatory competition and a
pilot shortage, may have trouble staffing their cockpits and paying
additional salaries if researchers say pilots should fly reduced
schedules.
   FAA scheduling regulations have changed little since the 1930s,
when lumbering prop planes rarely crossed more than one time zone a
day. Among those who think they can be improved is John Lauber, a
sleep researcher on the National Transportation Safety Board.
   ``An arbitrary restriction on flight and duty time and mandatory
rest time that doesn't take into account circadian factors is
simply not 20th century,'' he said. ``We know that an hour of sleep
is not an hour of sleep, depending on when you take it. One of the
biggest improvements we could make in our regulations would be to
recognize those factors and adjust schedules appropriately.''
   The experts contend that schedules should consider the time of
departure, the number of time zones crossed and the direction of
travel. (The body adjusts more quickly when traveling west to east
than east to west.)
   Another part of the problem is the plane itself. The modern
cockpit is a fine place for involuntary slumber. The lights are
dim. The seats are comfortable. The air rushes past with a soothing
hum.
   Planes are so automated that they quite literally fly
themselves. Except while landing and taking off, there is often
little for crew members to do. The newest planes don't even require
a flight engineer, so standard crew size is being reduced from
three members to two. Some pilots and sleep experts complain that
this increases the odds the entire crew will doze off.
   ``The fewer people in the cockpit, the fewer safeguards you
have,'' said Dr. Martin Moore-Ede of Harvard, a sleep expert at
Harvard Medical School. ``It's easier for two people to nod off
than three.''
   But Delmar Fadden, a Boeing administrator, asserts just the
opposite is likely: ``If there are only two in the cockpit, both
know that they can't rely on a third person, so they are more
attentive to the tasks they are doing and are much less likely to
allow themselves to go to sleep.''
   Fadden, who establishes design requirements for the Boeing 747
and 767, said, ``We can't do a lot about the fact that the crew
might be fatigued. What we try to do is make the airplane tolerant
of the crew's reaction.''
   This means designing planes to be safe even when flown by bored,
drowsy, inattentive pilots. If something goes wrong, such as a
generator failure, the plane automatically compensates without
waiting for the crew to act.
   Fadden said some planes being built will monitor their crews.
Alarms will sound if pilots do nothing for 20 minutes. Such a lapse
of activity could mean the pilots are daydreaming or worse.
   Another possible solution, used by the British during the
Falkland Islands crisis, is a drug to help pilots sleep before
night flights. Bill Storm, a psychologist at Brooks Air Force Base
in San Antonio, Texas, said the U.S. military is experimenting with
the drug temazepam.
   All of these suggested changes are intended to lessen the chance
that cockpit fatigue will combine with bad weather, equipment
failure and other random hazards to trigger a disaster.
   ``We run a very safe air transportation system,'' said Lauber.
``But we are pushing people harder. We know from anecdotal data
that people are not as alert as they should be. They are falling
asleep in some circumstances. I think it's appropriate that we
re-examine the way we approach these things.''

<HEAD>Sixth Member of Bush's Ethnic Coalition Resigns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A sixth member of an ethnic coalition
supporting Republican George Bush's presidential candidacy resigned
today as President Reagan declared that ``there isn't one iota of
discrimination'' among the group's members.
   Bush campaign spokesman Mark Goodin said the resignation of Radi
Slavoff as national co-chairman of Bulgarians for Bush was accepted
today.
   Slavoff quit the campaign after the Philadelphia Inquirer
identified him over the weekend as former head of the Bulgarian
National Front, which the paper said was formed after World War II
by members of the Nazi-aligned Bulgarian Legion.
   Reagan told reporters at the White House he believed five other
ethnic advisers resigned Monday ``because they didn't want to harm
the campaign.''
   The president was not asked specifically about the resignation
of Frederic V. Malek, a key Bush operative and deputy chairman of
the Republican National Committee who was named in a published
report about possibly anti-Semitic activities during the Nixon
administration.
   Asked whether he thought the Bush campaign suffered from an
appearance of anti-Semitism among some of the vice president's
supporters, Reagan replied, ``No.''
   Asked to elaborate, he said, ``Because I know him (Bush) and I
know the people involved and there isn't an iota of discrimination
in any of them.''
   Reagan commented after a Rose Garden ceremony where he signed
fair housing legislation.
   Bush and the five former officials of the ethnic coalition said
the controversy was politically motivated.
   ``We are resigning today from the `Coalition of American
Nationalities' and removing ourselves from the controversy because
we have been attacked unfairly by George Bush's political
opponents,'' the five said in a statement Monday issued by Bush
spokesman Mark Goodin. The statement did not name the opponents.
   In announcing the resignations, Goodin said the Bush campaign
conducted a review of the allegations and found nothing to
substantiate the reports.
   ``The charges appear to be politically inspired by individuals
who wish to divert public attention from the issues of the
campaign,'' Goodin said. ``Nonetheless, we believe these
individuals have done the right thing by removing themselves from
the controversy.''
   Asked about the resignations during a campaign stop in Illinois,
Bush told reporters, ``Nobody's giving in. These people left of
their own volition. We're not accusing anybody of anything.''
   The vice president added, ``We're getting into a very peculiar
deal where some people are accusing people. I don't like it a bit.''
   The controversy arose after publication last week of an article
in Washington Jewish Week, which said the Bush campaign committee
included Florian Galdau, described as the New York chief of the
Iron Guard, Romania's anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi movement, and Philip
Guarino, a Roman Catholic priest listed as member of an illegal,
neo-fascist Italian group.
   Galdau, honorary chairman of the committee, and Guarino, the
coalition's vice chairman, were among the five who resigned. Laszlo
Pasztor, described in the article as a Hungarian-American who
served in Hungary's pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic Arrowcross as a youth,
also resigned.
   The other two committee members to step down were Ignatius
Bilinsky and Bohdan Fedorak. Their alleged activities were not
immediately known.
   In the statement, the former coalition members said, ``these
Sasso-like attacks are aimed at neutralizing the strong support
which George Bush has and will continue to have in the ethnic
community.''
   John Sasso, a top aide to Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis,
was forced to resign last year after he circulated the so-called
``attack video'' against former Democratic candidate Sen. Joe Biden
of Delaware. Sasso rejoined the Dukakis campaign during the Labor
Day weekend.
   On Monday, Dukakis attacked Bush's judgment after the additional
resignations.
   ``I think it raises continuing questions about Mr. Bush's
judgment,'' Dukakis said, also raising as an issue Bush's selection
of Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate.
   The resignations came one day after Malek, a Bush appointee to
the Republican National Committee, stepped down after a published
report said that while Malek served in the Nixon administration he
compiled a list of Jewish employees in top posts at the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.
   John D. Ehrlichman, a former White House aide to President
Nixon, said Malek's resignation was politically ``exactly the right
thing to do,'' but that Malek was the victim of a ``bum rap''
because he was only following Nixon's orders.
   Ehrlichman, interviewed on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' show, said
Nixon's order to determine whether a ``Jewish cabal'' existed at
the Labor Department agency was ``pure Nixon venting spleen'' and
``rhetorical excess'' that his aides usually ignored.
   He said Malek was ``the farthest thing from a bigot of anybody I
know.''
   The decision by the five committee members also comes less than
a week after the coalition's co-chairman Jerome Brentar was
dismissed following the disclosure that he had defended John
Demjanjuk, the one-time Cleveland autoworker convicted in Israel as
a Nazi war criminal. He was also reported to be active in groups
that questioned whether the Holocaust had actually occurred.
   No replacements for the five committee members have been named,
Goodin said.

   Americans spent $449 million more than normal
last month to keep their cool.
   That's the word from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, which said that August's steamy weather raised the
national electricity bill to nearly $4.3 billion.
   The average residential electricity bill came to $104 in August,
$11 more than normal, according to the monthly climate impact
assessment issued by NOAA.
   Costs varied widely by region, however, ranging from a high of
$137 per residence for the month in the West South Central states
to a low of $50 along the Pacific Coast.
   The West North Central region was farthest above normal, while
electricity costs in the Pacific states were a dollar below normal.
   Normal cooling costs are defined as what it would be expected to
cost to cool a residence in average August weather, based on
temperature records for the past 30 years.
   Here is a rundown of the estimated August residential
electricity bills in each region and their difference from what
would have been expected in a normal August:
   _West South Central, $137, $10 above normal. Includes Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana.
   _East South Central, $118, $12 above normal. Includes Kentucky,
Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama.
   _West North Central, $113, $20 above normal. Includes North
Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and
Missouri.
   _South Atlantic, $113, $7 above normal. Includes Maryland,
Delaware, District of Columbia, West Virginia, Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.
   _East North Central, $99, $19 above normal. Includes Wisconsin,
Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
   _Mid-Atlantic, $90, $12 above normal. Includes New York, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania.
   _Mountain, $82, $3 above normal. Includes Montana, Idaho,
Wyoming, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico.
   _New England, $61, $9 above normal. Includes Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.
   _Pacific, $50, $1 below normal. Includes Washington, Oregon and
California.
   The monthly analysis does not includes cost estimates for Alaska
and Hawaii.

   An 18-year-old man told authorities he
sprayed the chemical Mace in three stores at a shopping center as a
practical joke, police said Tuesday. Eleven people were treated for
breathing problems.
   Fumes forced the evacuation of the Rosedale Center nearly two
hours before closing time, police said.
   Eleven people, including a firefighter, were treated at St.
Paul-Ramsey Medical Center and released, said Nursing Supervisor
Joanne Pesek.
   Police said Tuesday that a witness had seen the man spraying
Mace and charges were pending.
   ``We were in the store and all of our customers just started
coughing and wheezing at the same time,'' said Kelli Mulvaney of
Pet Centers, one of the three stores.
   Firefighters used fans to force contaminated air out. The center
reopened Tuesday.

<HEAD>Diarrhea Epidemic Worsens As Flood Waters Recede</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patches of foul-smelling mud emerged
Tuesday as flood waters filled with sewage and rotting garbage
continued to recede, and the government fought a losing battle
against a diarrhea epidemic.
   Although vast sections of the nation remained under several feet
of water, land emerged in Dhaka and other areas where millions of
people were living in waterlogged homes and makeshift shelters
because their houses were flooded.
   The number of officially reported diarrhea cases rose sharply,
and a senior health ministry official warned of major health
hazards.
   ``The filth caused by flooding and the millions of gallons of
sewage and tons of rotting garbage are posing a serious threat to
the health of 6 million people'' in Dhaka, the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The government's press information department said 33,054 new
cases of diarrhea were reported across the country in the past 24
hours. That's more than triple the number of cases reported on a
daily basis a week ago.
   Tuesday's report brought to 283,703 the number of officially
recorded diarrhea cases since Aug. 27, when the last round of
flooding began. The information department said the number of
diarrhea deaths since then was 150.
   The total number of flood deaths since June 13 _ when the summer
floods started, then receded before rising to new heights in late
August _ was 893, according to a government reports. But daily
reports in Dhaka newspapers said 1,723 people died from drowning,
snake bites, house collapsing and diseases.
   The real number is impossible to ascertain, given Bangladesh's
unwieldy bureaucracy and communications that were poor even before
floods that covered three-quarters of the nation.
   The Flood Control Center said all major rivers, including the
Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna, continued to fall by 1{ to 2 inches
a day. In most places this meant the rivers were still 16 to 27
inches above flood level.
   Jay F. Morris, deputy director of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, toured floded areas Tuesday and told
reporters he knew the water was receding, but ``It's worse than I
expected at this stage _ it's one of the worst things I've ever
seen in my life.''
   Morris arrived in Dhaka on Monday aboard a transport plane
bearing part of the United States's promised $150 million in relief
materials.
   Morris's tour included the village of Maosaid 15 miles northeast
of Dhaka where he distribuited about 350 food packets that were
prepared by the Care relief organization with funds from U.S. aid.
   Families designated by Care field workers received the packages
after waiting five hours for Morris' arrival at a Roman Catholic
church where flood waters lapped at the steps.
   Behind the church is a home for retarded girls operated by the
Sisters of Charity, the order headed by Mother Teresa of Calcutta,
India, winner of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize.
   Sister Blaise, a native of Ranchi, India, said she and the six
other Indian and Bangladeshi nuns had to tie the girls to keep them
from falling into three feet of water that flooded their dormitory
two weeks ago.
   The dormitory is now above water, but most of the village is a
sea of ankle-deep mud with pools of stagnated water.
   Sister Marie-Noel said most people in the village were eating
one meal a day because food stores were low, and the nuns were
taking rice and lentils from their dwindling stock to nearby areas
where people had lost their homes.

   Firefighters took
advantage of a cold spell to make some headway against blazes that
have devastated much of this famed park before hotter, drier
weather returns.
   ``The fire people realize that things could heat up again this
week,'' said fire information officer Sonya Capek. ``The fires are
still a threat; we are not out of it yet. We know there is some
more fire time left in the season, but hopefully it won't be as
intense.''
   Temperatures were only in the 40s this morning while the force
of some 8,000 firefighters worked to strengthen existing firebreaks
and prepare to protect the areas of Mammoth Hot Springs, and
Gardiner and Jardine, Mont., if necessary. Jardine and park
headquarters at Mammoth were evacuated before rain and snow fell
over the weekend.
   President Reagan said today that the Interior Department policy
of letting naturally caused fires burn in national forests had been
scrapped in the wake of the Yellowstone fires.
   Asked what he thought of the policy, Reagan told reporters, ``I
have questioned it. I did not even know it existed, frankly.'' He
said that Interior Secretary Donald Hodel has ``made it plain that
... we were withdrawing from this policy.''
   Updated forecasts for the area said the sky would be cloudy
through Wednesday, with highs rising to around 60 degrees and
isolated showers expected late today.
   In California, a fast-moving fire continued to burn out of
control today in the Gold Rush country of the Sierra Nevada
foothills, but firefighters said it was 30 percent contained.
   That blaze, which covered 40 square miles early today, has
consumed about 150 buildings, including more than 90 homes, and
forced the evacuation of more than 8,000 people.
   The fire was spreading into an area east of Beale Air Force
Base, a less populated area, and a forestry spokesman said
firefighters may be able to spend less time protecting structures
and devote more energy on containing the blaze.
   But fire officials stressed that many houses were still in
extreme danger, especially in Rough and Ready, a community of about
500 residents in the heavily wooded bottom of a steep canyon on the
edge of the fire.
   Elsewhere in California, fires burned in a remote section of
Sonoma County, north of San Francisco, and in Del Norte County near
the Oregon border.
   Fires also burned Monday in Montana, Colorado, Idaho, Utah,
Oregon and Washington state. The Interagency Fire Center in Boise,
Idaho, which coordinates firefighting efforts in the West, calls
this the worst forest fire season in 30 years.
   Temperatures at Yellowstone remained in the 40s Monday, keeping
humidity at up to 50 percent.
   , but the weather was expected to begin clearing today and the
mercury was expected to climb to 70 degrees by Wednesday.
   ``It's a sleeping giant now,'' said incident commander Denny
Bungarz during a briefing. ``We want to tie it down so when it
wakes up it can't run on us.''
   The historic fires have charred 939,270 acres of the 2.2
million-acre park since June.
   About 1,000 Marines from Camp Pendleton, Calif., were to reach
Yellowstone today to bolster firefighters. Some of the first
soldiers sent to Yellowstone, Army troops from Fort Lewis, Wash.,
were not to be released until at least Saturday.
   ``We'll have lots of people here, so maybe we can nail this
thing,'' Bungarz said.
   Firefighters worked Monday to strengthen fire lines and attack
hot spots as officials worked to establish a fire camp at Mammoth
Hot Springs.
   The favorable weather allowed park officials to open all roads
through the park except the northeast entrance leading to Cooke
City, Mont., where workers were repairing roads.
   Despite the return of warmer weather, the arrival of fall, with
lower temperatures and shorter days, had officials optimistic the
fires would make no more major advances.
   ``We still expect fire activity, but it won't be as intense or
as much or as fast as it has been in the past,'' said fire
information officer Sonya Capek. ``The days are getting shorter, so
the burning period is getting shorter.''
   Officials were also hopeful that a heavy snow will throw a wet,
white blanket on the fires soon. Light snow fell on Yellowstone
Sunday.
   ``We can generally expect some pretty good snowfalls in
September and early October,'' said the park's chief researcher,
John Varley. ``We usually have a pretty good snowstorm around the
equinox (Sept. 21), and I think we've all got our fingers crossed
that that will indeed come and put a further damper on the fires.''
   Elsewhere in the Yellowstone area, firefighters in the
Bridger-Teton National Forest hoped to control a 38,000-acre fire
by tonight.
   In northwestern Montana, crews made progress in their battle
against a 31,500-acre fire burning in and near Glacier National
Park. Gov. Ted Schwinden lifted a sweeping ban on all outdoor
recreational activities that was imposed because of fire danger.
   In Colorado, crews were pulled from fire lines Monday when
drizzle, rain and snow fell on the last of the forest fires that
have scorched more than 13,000 acres.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf ``Cordes was...'' with one graf to add that

<TEXT>
   Freed West German hostage Rudolf Cordes
was reunited with his wife Marlene today after she flew from Bonn
with senior government officials to take him home. Cordes said he
felt ``born again.''
   Hugging his tearful wife tightly, Cordes was escorted by Syrian
security officers to the Foreign Ministry in Damascus at 5 p.m. and
turned over to West German government envoys by Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa.
   ``I'm rejoicing for being a free man again. I feel I'm born
again,'' Cordes said. ``It is as if I have been granted a new life.
I am feeling perfect, and I'm in a very good shape.''
   Earlier, Cordes and his wife had an emotional reunion at the
government guest house where he spent the night after his release.
   ``She fell into his arms and they kissed each other for a long
time,'' an official who witnessed the reunion told The Associated
Press.
   He said Mrs. Cordes turned to Syrian army officers who escorted
her from the airport to the guest house and said: ``Thank you.
Thank you so much.''
   Cordes, 55, was released late Monday in Beirut by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem extremists who kidnapped him in January 1987. He was
driven to Damascus by Brig. Ali Hammoud, Syria's military
intelligence chief in Beirut.
   Cordes was the last West German hostage in Lebanon, where 17
other foreigners are held captive. Asked today if he had seen any
of the other hostages, he said: ``I haven't seen any hostages. I
was alone.''
   Cordes' captors said his release was linked to a Lebanese Shiite
on trial in West Germany for the 1985 hijacking of the TWA jet and
the shooting death of U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem.
   In a note issued in Beirut, they said if Mohammed Ali Hamadi's
release cannot be gained legally, ``then we shall be obliged to
again resort to violence.''
   Cordes and his wife were expected to drive from the Foreign
Ministry to the airport to take off in the Canadian-built
twin-engined jet for the five-hour flight to a military airbase
near Bonn.
   Seventeen foreigners, including nine Americans, are still
missing in Lebanon and it is believed most are held by pro-Iranian
Shiite kidnappers. Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. Anderson, 40, was
kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   In Bonn, a West German government spokesman, who asked not to be
further identified, said he knew of no deal with Iran or with the
kidnappers for Cordes' freedom.
   The government has repeatedly denied that it paid a ransom for
the release last September for Alfred Schmidt, another West German
who had been held captive in Beirut.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said his government will use the
country's ties with Iran and Syria to try gain freedom for other
hostages in Lebanon. And Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
credited West Germany's continuing ties with Iran for helping to
bring about Cordes' release.
   Cordes and Schmidt were kidnapped in Beirut in January 1987 in
the week after Hamadi's arrest in Frankfurt.
   Schmidt, an engineer, was freed Sept. 7, 1987.
   Hamadi, 24, has acknowledged in a Frankfurt court to hijacking
the plane but denies killing Stethem. In the murder and air piracy
trial Monday, the captain of the hijacked jetliner, John Testrake,
testified that he believed Hamadi fired the shot that killed
Stethem aboard the aircraft.
   The kidnappers' note, one of three issued Monday in Beirut, said
the decision to release Cordes ``does not mean in any way the
abandonment of holy warrior Mohammed Hamadi.''
   His brother, Abbas Hamadi, 29, is serving a 13-year prison
sentence in Frankfurt. He was convicted in April of complicity in
kidnapping Cordes and Schmidt in an effort to force West Germany to
free Mohammed Hamadi.
   In another development, Lebanon radio and U.S. officials said an
American engineer who was kidnapped in Lebanon on Sunday
overpowered his captors and escaped to Damascus on Monday with the
help of Syrian troops.
   Another version said Syrian troops in Lebanon rescued the
engineer, identified in Washington as Kenneth Wells, after
overpowering the kidnappers.
   The discrepancies could not immediately be reconciled.
   Gunmen abducted Wells, 25, who reportedly works in Saudi Arabia
for Litton Industries and holds a black belt in karate.

   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and former Labor
Secretary Bill Brock were among 10 prominent men honored Tuesday as
``Good Guys'' by the bipartisan National Women's Political Caucus.
   Clinton was chosen ``for his leadership in the national campaign
for safe, quality child care,'' the caucus said.
   The Arkansas Democrat, perhaps better known for the
extraordinarily long speech he delivered at the Democratic National
Convention in July, has been heavily involved in congressional
efforts to expand child care services and help welfare mothers.
   Representing the National Governors Association, Clinton has
testified numerous times on behalf of welfare reform bills and a
$2.5 billion initiative designed to improve and expand child care.
   Brock, who left the administration this year to head Sen. Bob
Dole's unsuccessful presidential bid, was cited ``for his
behind-the-scenes support in the battle to maintain afirmative
action programs.''
   The caucus scheduled a Good Guy Awards Dinner on Tuesday night
in honor of Clinton, Brock and eight other ``men who have made
special contributions to women's progress.'' They are:
   _Television producer Gary David Goldberg, creator of ``Family
Ties'' and ``Day to Day,'' for his pivotal role in guaranteeing
on-site child care at Paramount Studies and his support for
parental leave.
   _Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., for advocating women's rights and
``his role as a steadfast standard-bearer for Republican
feminists.''
   _Cartoonist Greg Howard, for the comic strip ``Sally Forth,''
``his sensitive yet humorous depiction of the conflicts and
victories of working women.''
   _Novelist John Irving, author of ``The Cider House Rules,'' for
``his searing tale of women who risked their lives when abortions
were illegal ... and his passionate activism for abortion rights.''
   _Retiring Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., for 40 years as ``a premier
statesman'' and leader in the fights for civil rights and the Equal
Rights Amendment.
   _Hicks B. Waldron, Avon chairman and chief executive officer,
for his role in guaranteeing Avon's commitment to training and
advancement of women and minorities for senior management-level
positions.
   _William Wynn, international president of the United Food and
Commercial Workers Union, for leadership in attaining workplace
benefits for women.
   _Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, for actively recruiting and
supporting women as senior participants in city government.

   A firebombing apparently stemming from a $275
drug deal that went sour killed two young sisters who had been left
alone in a locked room and critically injured a third, police said.
   The Sunday evening firebombing had been meant for another man in
the building, authorities said.
   Police announced today that they have arrested one man and were
expecting the surrender of a second later in the day. Lt. George
Hollocher said investigators were seeking warrants charging both
with two counts of first-degree murder, arson and assault.
   Their identities were not released pending formal filing of
charges. Four men who had been with the suspects were being sought
for questioning.
   Sgt. Joe Marcinkiewicz of the bomb and arson squad said
investigators had determined that two Molotov cocktails were thrown
through a first-floor window of the three-story home.
   Firefighters rescued the children, who authorities said had been
left unattended in a locked bedroom. But Erica Butler, 1, and
Ashley Evans, 4, died later of smoke inhalation at Children's
Hospital. Lenora Butler, 5 months, was in critical condition this
morning, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   The children's mother, Cassandra Evans, 18, was not at home at
the time of the firebombing because she and her boyfriend were out
looking for her 16-year-old brother, who was allegedly involved in
the drug deal, Marcinkiewicz said.
   Marcinkiewicz said that shortly after 11 p.m. Sunday, six men
stopped at the home and one of them paid $275 for drugs to the
brother and another 16-year-olds. Instead of giving the man drugs,
the two youths fled with the money, the investigator said.
   He said the car returned about 20 minutes later, and the
firebombs were hurled into the house.
   Several family members said Ms. Evans routinely locked her
children in the bedroom to protect valuables she kept there. Other
adults and children escaped without injury. A total of 15 people
lived in the house, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   A handicapped woman who persisted with
efforts to help the needy even while she was homeless has been
honored by the same federal agency that had her evicted last year.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development honored Dorothea
Bradley at a luncheon Monday with a Presidential Recognition Award
for her community service.
   The award covers 1987, the year she was locked out of her house,
where she used to distribute groceries to fellow handicapped
residents.
   Ms. Bradley had lived rent-free in the Pasadena home for five
years, but the owners defaulted on their low-interest Federal
Housing Administration loan and a U.S. marshal padlocked the door
last November.
   That left her a bit skeptical about HUD.
   ``When HUD called to tell me I had won an award, I said, `Sure.'
Then I began to get letters telling me about it,'' she said.
   In July, HUD sent correspondence that offered congratulations
from President Reagan for her ``successful efforts to improve the
nutritional well-being of low-income, handicapped persons.''
   After she was evicted, Ms. Bradley continued to help the needy,
distributing food from a room at the American Friends Committee in
Pasadena under a food giveaway program subsidized by HUD.
   Ms. Bradley said she lived in her van for two months until a man
who heard about her plight rented her a small house.
   ``I never stopped helping the handicapped,'' said Ms. Bradley,
who suffers from an arthritic spine and lives on a monthly Social
Security check.
   Despite the eviction, Ms. Bradley apparently harbors no
bitterness. The commendation letter from HUD has an honored place
in her home.
   ``Everyday when I sit down for dinner I look at it, smile and
know that they do care about me,'' Ms. Bradley said. ``I didn't
think anybody paid any attention to me or even cared.''

<TEXT>
   The California Supreme Court has refused to
hear the appeal of a gay bathhouse that was shut down by a court
order under a new Los Angeles County enforcement policy aimed at
combatting the spread of AIDS.
   The court's action Monday left intact the first such order under
the county's policy, which requires any bathhouse in which anal or
oral sex takes place to be closed as a public nuisance. A previous
policy prohibited anal sex without condoms in bathhouses but did
not seek to close the establishments.
   ``We were attempting to work with bathhouses, have them serve as
education centers,'' said Deputy County Counsel Steven Carnevale.
``We thought they would go away by themselves because they were
losing business. It turned out that they were much larger than
anybody expected.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread largely through
sexual contact and sharing of infected needles by drug abusers.
   In May, Los Angeles County officials sought to close Mac's
bathhouse after an undercover investigation found numerous
violations. An injunction was issued Aug. 30.
   After a state appeals court refused to intervene, lawyers for
Mac's appealed last week to the state Supreme Court.
   Attorney Barrett Litt argued that the order closing Mac's was
excessive because an order forbidding specific sexual practices
would accomplish the same goal while protecting the privacy rights
of the bathhouse's customers.
   Quoting a number of health experts, Litt said closing gay
bathhouses would not reduce the risk of AIDS and would likely
increase it. Sexual activities at bathhouses were ``safer than in
the general population,'' he said.
   After the violations were found, Mac's required every patron to
sign a copy of the rules, distributed cards stating the risk of
specific types of sexual activities, and started showing ``safe
sex'' videos, Litt said.
   The county still has about 10 bathhouses, which are generally
making good-faith efforts to follow the rules prohibiting sexual
intercourse, Carnevale said. San Francisco closed down its gay
bathhouses.

<TEXT>
   Heavy combat in northern rebel
strongholds killed or wounded more than 80 leftists guerrillas and
government troops, a military spokesman said today.
   Col. Galileo Torres said guerrillas attacked the El Paraiso
garrison, headquarters of the 4th army brigade, in Chalatenango
province at 1:05 a.m. with mortar fire.
   Nine soldiers and five guerrillas died in the attack 37 miles
north of the capital of San Salvador and 12 government troops were
wounded, he said.
   Torres, head of the armed forces press office, also said there
were a series of clashes in northern Morazan province between
government units and guerrillas.
   The rebels suffered 50 casualties in Morazan and five soldiers
were wounded, he said in a telephone interview.
   Both provinces are strongholds of the rebel Faribuno Marti
National Liberation Front where guerrillas move freely and even
exercise some administration of towns and villages.
   He said the fighting at El Paraiso lasted two hours and officers
on the scene believed ``quite a few'' rebels were wounded. The
bodies of five rebels and six M-16 assault rifles were recovered,
Torres said.
   It was the first guerrilla attack on a brigade headquarters
since a February assault on the 3rd brigade in eastern Usulutan
province.
   A U.S. military adviser, the first to die in combat, was killed
at El Paraiso in March 1987 when rebels penetrated the base,
killing 70 government soldiers. There are several dozen U.S.
military advisers at bases in Chalatenango.
   Torres said the fighting in Morazan began at 4 p.m. Monday and
lasted until 3 a.m. Tuesday. He called it a series of encounters
between three government commando units of about 15 men each and a
``significant'' guerrilla column.
   Helicopters ferrying wounded soldiers and supplies were still
coming under fire several hours after the main clashes ended, he
said, and troops were still mopping up around Gigante Hill outside
Perquin, 125 miles northeast of San Salvador.
   He said Col. Emilio Ponce, commander of the eastern military
zone, told him at mid-morning there was still no breakdown between
dead and wounded in the 50 guerrilla casualities. He said he did
not know how many bodies had been recovered.
   There was no way to immediately confirm the official casualty
figures.
   Earlier this month, the military claimed 25 rebels dead near
Tejutepeque in central El Salvador. But reporters at the scene
confirmed only four dead. Precise casualties are also hard to pin
down because the rebels try to remove their dead from the
battlefield.

   The president of First Nationwide Bank
complained to a congressional panel Tuesday that his institution
should not have been frozen out of negotiations in the largest-ever
government rescue of a savings association.
   Robert E. Lackovic, president of the San Francisco-based First
Nationwide, told the House Energy and Commerce oversight
subcommittee, that federal regulators cannot be sure they got the
best deal in the rescue of American Savings and Loan Association of
Stockton, Calif., because regulators had negotiated exclusively
since April with the investors who were eventually chosen to take
over American.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board announced Sept. 5 that they
were providing $2 billion in government assistance to the Robert M.
Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas, to acquire American, the largest
insolvent S&L in the nation. Bass, in its first venture into the
savings industry, is putting up $550 million.
   First Nationwide, a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co., had
unsuccessfully tried through most of 1987 and early this year to
close a deal with the bank board. As the government's negotiations
with Bass continued, First Nationwide failed in attempts to get
back in the running.
   ``First Nationwide cannot help but be disappointed in the
outcome of negotiations. Had we been given the opportunity to
remain in the bidding, the outcome may have been the same, but the
uncertainty as to whether the government indeed had accepted the
best bid would have been eliminated,'' Lackovic told the
subcommittee chaired by Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich.
   Lackovic also criticized a provision of the Bass deal which
permits the investment group to use $1.5 billion of American's
resources for a merchant bank to invest in corporate takeovers and
other ventures not traditional for savings institutions.
   ``We do not believe that (Congress') intent was to permit ... a
merchant bank to use low-cost funds from savings and loan
institutions,'' he said. ``... In many instances, the troubled
thrifts are the ones that deviated widely from their traditional
role and have engaged in highly risky investments.''
   Lackovic questioned the wisdom of the government in retaining
about a 30 percent ownership interest in the new American.
   ``Can the board apply the same standards to thrifts in which it
owns a significant share, versus a competitor it regulates that is
owned by private sector shareholders?'' he asked.
   Also, alluding to Bass' lack of experience in the savings field,
Lackovic said, ``It is vital that the bank board work with ...
companies that have demonstrated long-term commitments to the
savings and loan industry.''
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the bank board, has defended the Bass
deal, arguing that the $1.5 billion is a relatively small piece of
American and that a merchant bank was worth trying.
   He also has said that maintaining and ownership interest in a
rescued institution gives the government a chance to recoup some of
its investments. And, he has said it is important to bring outside
capital into the savings industry.

<HEAD>City Ordered To Return Documents From Wayne Williams Files To FBI</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of documents relating to the slayings
of 29 black children in Atlanta must be returned to the FBI, a
judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman instructed city officials
to return files containing 2,300 documents related to the
investigation of the killings in 1979-81.
   The files were released to the public in 1987 along with Atlanta
police files on the case. The federal government then sued Atlanta
Public Safety Commissioner George Napper, charging that he violated
federal law when he released FBI documents along with the police
files.
   Freeman's order, filed Aug. 31, said the issue was whether the
city had acted properly in releasing information the FBI had shared
only on the condition it remain confidential.
   ``The court here is not concerned with whether the investigatory
documents should be released to the public,'' Freeman's order said.
``The question before the court is who owns, and is entitled to
possession of, the documents.''
   Napper had released the police files in response to an order by
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Luther Alverson, who ruled in a
lawsuit filed by several news media organizations.
   Wayne Williams, an Atlanta free-lance photographer, was
convicted in 1982 of two of the 29 murders and was sentenced to
life imprisonment. Police officials later attributed 22 other
slayings to Williams; five cases remain open.
   Williams is appealing his conviction.

   The richest treasury of archeological
artifacts ever found in the Americas has been discovered in the
1,500-year-old tomb of a warrior-leader of a civilization that once
dominated Peru, the National Geographic Society announced Tuesday.
   The tomb, containing the remains of a man who apparently was a
major chief of the Moche people, was excavated by Peruvian
archeologists who were tipped to the site by grave robbers.
   ``It is truly the richest-ever find archeologically in the
Americas,'' said Christopher B. Donnan, a UCLA professor who has
spent his career studying the Moche people. ``This should greatly
accelerate the reconstruction of one of the greatest of the
American civilizations.''
   The year-long excavation of the tomb was conducted by a team of
Peruvian archeologists led by Walter Alva, director of the Bruning
Museum of Lambayeque, Peru. The work was funded by the National
Geographic Society.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Alva said through a translator
that the tomb was discovered after gold and silver artifacts began
turning up on the black market in January, 1987. Some of the
artifacts were confiscated by the customs office in Los Angeles, he
said.
   Police in Peru raided the home of a suspected grave robber,
resulting in a shootout that killed one, said Alva. Artifacts
recovered from the home were traced to a site near the village of
Sipan.
   Alva said the area, adjacent to two eroding adobe pyramids,
appears to contain up to 10 tombs of Moche leaders. He said there
are plans to excavate them all.
   The Moche people, said Alva, created a civilization skilled in
metal work and agriculture. He said they built a complex irrigation
system that enabled them to establish an advanced society on the
dry coastal plains of Peru starting in about 100 A.D. The
civilization lasted about 1,000 years, he said, and eventually was
supplanted by the Incas. The Incas, in turn, were conquered by the
Spanish in the 1530s.
   Alva said the tomb that has been excavated contains the remains
of a ``warrior-priest'' encased in a wooden coffin and surrounded
by thousands of articles made of gold, silver, precious stone, and
ceramic. He said the man was about 40 and was at or near the
pinnacle of power in the Moche civilization during his lifetime.
   Decay of the bones made it impossible to determine the cause of
death, he said, but there was no evidence of violence.
   Also in the tomb, said Alva, are up to eight other human
remains, plus those of a dog and two llamas.
   It appears, he said, that the servants and wives of the Moche
leaders were sacrificed and buried with them.
   One of the skeletons was found above the others, apparently
placed there, Alva said, as a ``guardian.'' The skeleton is that of
a young warrior. Alva said both feet of the guardian had been
amputated, apparently in the belief that it would keep the young
warrior from fleeing his assignment to guard his leader in death.
   Alva said excavation of the site began under armed guard because
many of the people living in nearby villages regarded the official
archeologists as grave robbers. Now, he said, there is a growing
understanding that artifacts in the tomb ``are treasures that
belong to the all the Peruvian people.''
   Many of the art works discovered, including a crown, a knife, a
mask and strands of beads, are made of gold. One strand of gold
beads is fashioned to resemble unshelled peanuts.
   One bead is about the size of a human palm and is made of 22
karat gold, Donnan said. The bead, which is a sculpted human head,
had eyes made of silver and eye pupils made of precious stone. It
was shown at the news conference while two armed guards stood
nearby.
   The tomb also contained more than 1,000 pots, bowls, beakers and
jars, along with articles made of copper.
   Alva said his team now is excavating another tomb in the Sipan
area.

<HEAD>Pentagon Cuts Length of Panama Duty Tours</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Defense Department has ordered a cut in
the required tour length for all military personnel stationed in
Panama as part of an effort to reduce the number of dependents in
the troubled Central American nation, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   Dan Howard, the department's chief spokesman, said the policy
change would reduce from 36 months to 30 months the required tour
for servicemen accompanied by their families and drop from 24
months to 15 months the tour for those deploying alone.
   The latter reduction is considered the most important. Howard
explained the department also is enforcing a change to its
``concurrent travel'' policy, under which servicemen cannot bring
their families to Panama unless they have already secured housing
on a military reservation.
   Since there is currently a waiting period of up to nine months
for such housing, ``the new tour length should encourage more
soldiers just to go unaccompanied,'' added Maj. Kathy Wood, a
Pentagon spokeswoman.
   Panama is the home of the U.S. Southern Command, the
organization responsible for all U.S. military forces in Central
and South America. About 10,000 American servicemen are stationed
permanently in Panama, and about 2,200 others have been assigned
there on a temporary basis since the spring to upgrade security at
U.S. bases.
   According to Wood, the decision to reduce the tour lengths was
made initially last week by the Army, gaining the approval of Gen.
Carl E. Vuono, the chief of staff, and Army Secretary John O.
Marsh. The Defense Department then reviewed the matter and ordered
similar changes for the Air Force and Navy, which have much smaller
contingents in Panama.
   Over the past six months, the Pentagon has succeeded in reducing
by 50 percent the number of military families living outside U.S.
bases in Panama _ dropping the total still off base to about 1,100.
The effort has taken on more momentum this summer because of what
the United States describes as a deliberate campaign of harassing
Americans assigned to Panama.
   U.S. officials in Panama City said on Aug. 21 that American
personnel had reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by
Panamanian authorities this year, including attempts to extort
bribes for traffic violations and the stoppage of mail.
   The harassment comes at a time when the United States is
continuing to press economic sanctions against Panama in a bid to
oust the country's military leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
who has been indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida on
drug-trafficking charges.

<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle
ridiculed Michael Dukakis' national security credentials today and
joked that the Democratic nominee ``lost his top naval adviser last
week _ his rubber duck drowned in his bathtub.''
   Quayle accused Dukakis of lacking knowledge of defense and
foreign policy matters even as the Democratic candidate delivered a
major policy speech in Chicago on Soviet-American relations.
   ``It's sad for America to have somebody that doesn't have the
understanding or qualifications in national security to be the
Democratic nominee for president,'' Quayle told an audience at
Bush-Quayle campaign headquarters for Wisconsin.
   He said he had ``a sad story'' to tell about the Dukakis
campaign.
   ``The governor of Massachusetts, he lost his top naval adviser
last week,'' Quayle said. ``His rubber duck drowned in his
bathtub.''
   Dukakis press secretary Dayton Duncan responded, ``Quayle's
trying to call attention to his age.'' Quayle is 41.
   On Monday, Quayle blasted Dukakis' economic program, telling a
Michigan audience that the Democratic candidate's heart ``may be in
the right place but his hand'll be back in your pocket'' with
higher taxes and government spending if he is elected in November.
   Dukakis would end the economic expansion of the Reagan years and
``return us once again to those chilling days of no-growth'' under
Jimmy Carter, Quayle asserted at a speech in Kalamazoo, Mich., and
in campaign stops aimed at blue-collar workers and their employers.
   The Republican vice presidential candidate travels to Bismarck,
N.D., today and Colorado as he continues this week's swing through
the Midwest and West.
   The trip began with a tour of an American Instruments
Corporation plant in Kalamazoo, a city of about 100,000 that has
weathered tough economic times during the decade.
   About half of American Instruments' 75 workers have participated
in training programs through the Job Training Partnership Act,
which Quayle helped write. The 1982 federal law encourages
businesses to train disadvantaged or dislocated workers and place
them in local jobs.
   In remarks to business leaders at the Rotary Club, Quayle
sounded the ``good jobs, good wages'' theme that has become a
standard part of Dukakis' speeches.
   He said stagnation and ``unguided'' economic policies had been
the result of ``the last liberal state governor we plucked from
relative obscurity and put in the White House'' _ a reference to
Carter.
   But during the Republican administration, 17 million new jobs
were created, 12 million of them in occupations with wages
averaging more than $20,000 a year, including 5.5 million with
wages averaging closer to $30,000, Quayle said.
   ``They're good jobs at good wages and that's a record to be
proud of,'' Quayle said.
   The message for those who have not yet ``made it'' because of
past disadvantage or discrimination, Quayle said, is that America
still can be ``the land of opportunity in which free men and women
can prosper through their own efforts and their own hard work.''
   Quayle also toured a Milwaukee plant which makes heavy equipment
for U.S. weapons systems. He drew cheers from the workers when he
got behind the controls of a giant forklift and told the crowd, ``I
want my union card.''
   When someone shouted that he would have to pay his dues, Quayle,
whose campaign has been beset by a series of highly publicized
controversies over his military service and academic record, shot
back: ``I've paid some dues over these last few weeks.''
   Quayle also responded later to comments by Dukakis, who said
Monday that George Bush's ``answer to drug kingpins like (Panama
leader Manuel) Noriega is J. Danforth Quayle.''
   ``The governor obviously doesn't know what he's talking about,''
Quayle told reporters. ``We've conducted a very vigorous war on
drugs ... Quite frankly, contrary to the governor of Massachusetts,
who obviously doesn't believe that tough law enforcement provides a
deterrence, we do.''

   Three of the most prominent
anti-apartheid activists detained under state-of-emergency
regulations escaped from a hospital today and took refuge in the
U.S. consulate.
   The three men have requested a meeting with U.S. Ambassador
Edward Perkins.
   Two of the men are senior officials of the banned United
Democratic Front _ publicity secretary Murphy Morobe, a black, and
acting general secretary Mohammed Valli Moosa, an Indian. The other
is Vusi Khanyile, a black who was chairman of the banned National
Education Crisis Committee.
   The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria issued a statement confirming that
the three had taken refuge at the consulate, on the 11th floor of
an office building in downtown Johannesburg.
   ``We were in frequent contact with these three men prior to
their detention without charge and hold them in high regard,'' the
statement said. ``We will not press them to leave against their
will.''
   The statement said the United States does not offer asylum at
its diplomatic offices. But it said these premises are inviolable
under international law and may not be entered by the host
government without consent.
   The embassy said it was discussing the situation with the
activists and the South African government.
   Brig. Leon Mellet, a spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry,
confirmed the incident and said the men escaped from Johannesburg
General Hospital, where they had been receiving physiotherapy. No
details of the escape were disclosed.
   Previously, the three had been at Johannesburg's Diepkloof
Prison.
   At the consulate, there was no visible sign of security force
deployments. A private guard stood at the entrance while about two
dozen journalists waited in the hall.
   Morobe, 32, and Valli Moosa, 34, were detained in July 1987
after working clandestinely for the front since a state of
emergency was declared June 12, 1986. Khanyile, 37, was detained in
December 1986.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the state of emergency. The government has
not released comprehensive statistics, but it said recently that
802 people who had been held at least 30 days were still in custody.
   Many of the detainees were members of organizations affiliated
to the United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition of more than
600 anti-apartheid groups.
   Also detained were virtually all top leaders of the National
Education Crisis Committee, a coalition of parent, teacher and
student groups seeking to give blacks more control over curriculum
and policies in their schools.
   The committee was instrumental in calling off classroom boycotts
that spread nationwide in 1985-86, but the government outlawed its
subsequent campaign for ``people's education.''
   The United Democratic Front and the crisis committee were among
17 anti-apartheid organizations banned in February from conducting
any activities.
   Twice in recent years, activists have taken refuge at diplomatic
missions in South Africa. Six front leaders stayed at the British
Consulate in Durban for several weeks in late 1984 before emerging
to face arrest for high treason. The charges later were withdrawn.
   In September 1987, South Africa agreed to let a Dutchman, Klaus
de Jonge, return to the Netherlands after being holed up at a Dutch
Embassy office in Pretoria for two years. De Jonge escaped into the
office from police custody after being arrested for aiding the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.

   A large boulder tumbled onto a roadway after
a thunderstorm and sheared off the front of a Greyhound bus,
killing five people and injuring 14, authorities said.
   ``I felt an impact ... a big concussion and (what sounded like)
a loud explosion, kind of deafening,'' said Sean K. Jones, one of
two passengers who escaped injury. ``All of a sudden, I felt debris
coming at us. A bright light flashed, like sparks and electricity
in the front end of the bus.''
   The bus, bound from Denver to Albuquerque with 20 passengers and
a driver aboard, was struck on New Mexico Highway 68 late Monday,
said State Police spokeswoman Lupita Carrion.
   The accident occurred in a mountainous area about 50 miles north
of Santa Fe, where the highway parallels the Rio Embudo near the
point where that river meets the Rio Grande.
   The driver and four passengers died, and 14 passengers were
injured, Ms. Carrion said. Four of the injured passengers were
admitted to hospitals; their injuries were not described as
life-threatening.
   Satwant Khalsa, deputy state medical investigator, said all five
of the dead were adults. Although positive identification remains
incomplete, he said one of the victims was from India and another
was from Japan. Hospital officials said six of the injured were
children under 10 years old.
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley identified the driver as
Gaylon Greer Parks, 39, of Denver, who had been with the company
exactly seven years Monday.
   A large rock tumbled from the mountain as the bus approached,
said State Police Officer Harold Zuni. ``It sheared the front end
of the bus off,'' Zuni said, describing the boulder as ``about as
big as the front end of a car.''
   At the site of the crash, the highway is flanked on the left by
a sheer cliff and on the right by a bank that drops off about 40
feet into the Rio Grande.
   Witnesses said the impact of the boulder pushed the bus into
some rocks that had fallen at the right side of the road, keeping
the bus from plunging into the river. The driver apparently was
killed instantly.
   The Rev. Andrew McComb, a fire department volunteer, said that
if the bus had gone off the road 10 feet sooner, it would have
tumbled into the Rio Grande. ``There wouldn't have been anything
left of this bus,'' he said.
   The area had been hit by a powerful thunderstorm just a few
hours before the accident, and state Police Officer T.R. Rodella
said the rain may have triggered the fall of rocks.
   It was initially feared that some of the passengers may have
been thrown into the river, but O.R. Mascarenas of a search and
rescue team said all 21 people aboard had apparently been accounted
for.
   Jones, a Mormon missionary from Fort Garland, Colo., said that
after the impact, ``I immediately went down, put my head against
the seat ahead of us, and my companion did the same. And we came to
a really abrupt halt (in the rocks).''
   ``I do feel lucky,'' he said.
   ``All we heard were screams,'' said passenger David Fuller, 20,
another Mormon missionary who was on his way to Albuquerque to take
up a post there.
   One of the injured passengers, Cruz Sanchez of Houston, told the
Albuquerque Journal that after the impact he hit the floor while
others were thrown around the bus. He said he saw a crying infant
trapped beneath some seats; the child's mother, who appeared to be
dead, was nearby.
   ``Children were crying, people were crying, people were lying
down,'' Sanchez said.
   He said he and another man freed the infant and then began
helping other passengers from the bus because they feared an
explosion.
   ``I feel fortunate,'' he said. ``I didn't even feel the pain
until afterwards. ... I was just concerned for that woman and her
baby.''
   Fuller said the driver was ``taking it easy,'' going only 45 or
55 mph, when the crash occurred.
   The 14 injured were taken to the emergency room of Espanola
Hospital, nearly 20 miles southwest of Embudo, said hospital
administrator Grant Nelson.
   He said four people were admitted, two of whom were later
transferred to another hospital, and 10 were treated for lesser
injuries and released.
   Vicki Dudley, district sales manager for Greyhound in
Albuquerque, who was at the scene, said the company is cooperating
with the police and rescue investigation but declined to comment
further.

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts has slipped from first place to
10th in the past year among states with the lowest unemployment
rates, while neighboring Vermont emerged as the best job provider
for its residents, according to a government report issued Tuesday.
   With an unemployment rate of just 2.3 percent in July, and just
6,900 of its workers lacking jobs, Vermont replaced New Hampshire
as the state with the lowest joblessness, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics said.
   New Hampshire, whose jobless rate climbed from 2 percent in June
to 2.5 percent in July, had been leading the nation with the lowest
unemployment since last October.
   Massachusetts' unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose from 3.4
percent in June to 3.6 percent in July. It was a full percentage
point higher that the same month a year ago, when it held the title
as the state with the lowest joblessness.
   The number of jobless in Massachusetts climbed by more than
25,000 to 155,600 over the year, despite the addition of nearly
60,000 new jobs in the state, according to the BLS data.
   Following Vermont and New Hampshire with the lowest unemployment
rates in July were Hawaii and Delaware at 3.1 percent each,
Connecticut and North Carolina at 3.2 percent each, Rhode Island at
3.3 percent, Nebraska at 3.4 percent and Minnesota at 3.5 percent.
   Louisiana continued to be the only state with double-digit
joblessness, 10.2 percent in July, down from 10.6 percent a month
earlier.
   Kentucky, New Mexico and West Virginia all had unemployment
rates above 8 percent compared with a nationwide jobless rate of
5.5 percent for the month, the bureau said. All of the figures are
unadjusted for seasonal variations.
   While the jobless rate nationwide declined 0.6 percentage point
over the year, it dropped much more dramatically in several states.
Mississippi, Wyoming, Idaho and Texas all saw their unemployment
rates drop by more than 2 full percentage points in the 12 months.
   Unemployment rates over the year rose in only three states:
Massachusetts, Georgia and Arkansas.
   States with the largest job growth over the year were Nevada, up
6.1 percent; Delaware, up 5 percent; Florida and Maine, both up 4.7
percent, and Washington, up 4.4 percent.
   The bureau said service type employment increased in virtually
all of the states while 80 percent of them also showed gains in
manufacturing, transportation, trade and government jobs.
   Cities with the lowest jobless rate in the country were
Burlington, Vt., at 1.8 percent and Stamford, Conn., at 2 percent.
Flint, Mich., had the highest unemployment rate at 14.9 percent
followed by the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission area of Texas at 14.8
percent.

<HEAD>Israeli Peace Crusader Meets With Arafat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli peace crusader Abie Nathan could be
criminally prosecuted for holding talks with PLO chief Yasser
Arafat and offering a peace plan that calls for mutual recognition,
Israel radio reported today.
   The meeting prompted a political storm in Israel.
   Right-wing legislators said Nathan should to be tried for
treason, but left-wing politicians praised the meeting as an
important step toward ending the 9-month-old Palestinian uprising
in the occupied lands.
   Israel radio said Nathan recently met with Arafat in Tunis and
presented the PLO leader with a peace plan that includes mutual
recognition between Israel and the PLO, a PLO agreement to a
100-day moratorium on violence, and an end to the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Nathan's plan also calls for the release of Israeli soldiers
missing or captured in Lebanon in exchange for the Israeli release
of thousands of Palestinians detained since the uprising began Dec.
8, Israel radio said.
   According to the United Nations, more than 260 Palestinians have
been killed in the uprising and five Israelis also have died.
   Nathan said Arafat promised to consider the peace proposals
after he meets Tuesday with socialist members of the European
Parliament in Strasbourg, France, according to Israel radio.
   Nathan, who founded the Voice of Peace radio station in 1973,
could face prosecution and a prison sentence of up to three years
for his visit with the Palestine Liberation Organization leader.
   The meeting violates a 1986 Israeli law barring unauthorized
contacts with members of terrorist groups. Israel views the PLO as
a terrorist group.
   Four Israeli leftists are serving six-month prison terms for
meeting with PLO members in Romania in 1986.
   Nathan hopes to brief Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres on his encounter with the PLO chief when he
returns to Israel, Israel radio said.
   Both Peres, who favors an international Middle East peace
conference, and Shamir, who opposes such a forum, have staunchly
refused to include the PLO in peace negotiations.
   Right-wing legislator Yuval Nehman of the Tehiya Party demanded
that Nathan be arrested on his return to Israel for illegally
meeting with an enemy, the radio said. But two Israeli left-wing
parties _ Mapam and the Progressive List for Peace _ praised Nathan
for making an important step toward peace.
   Left-wing legislator Yair Zaban of Mapam said Nathan was an
Israeli ``patriot'' and urged the PLO to recognize Israel, Israel
radio said.
   Nathan's radio station beams mostly rock music programs from a
ship anchored outside Tel Aviv in the Mediterranean Sea.
   In its heyday a decade ago, the so-called Peace Ship dodged
bullets to broadcast peace messages from Beirut during the 1973
Arab-Israeli war.
   Two years later, the vessel delivered 100,000 flowers to the
people of Egypt as a gesture of peace.

   Robert W. T'Souvas died a bum, a homeless
39-year-old man shot in the head after arguing over a bottle of
vodka under a downtown bridge.
   Relatives say life had mostly been downhill for T'Souvas in the
nearly two decades since he was charged with killing two Vietnamese
children in what came to be known as the My Lai massacre.
   ``He had problems with Vietnam over and over. He didn't talk
about it much. But he had problems with the body counts, things
like that,'' said his father, William T'Souvas, of San Jose, Calif.
   ``He lasted 20 years, but he was walking a tight line,'' the
elder T'Souvas said.
   Army Spec. 4 T'Souvas, then 19 and a high school dropout in San
Jose, was a member of one of three platoons that entered the
village of My Lai on March 16, 1968, looking for Viet Cong troops
but finding civilians instead.
   The platoon moved into My Lai, firing on fleeing Vietnamese,
tossing grenades into houses and slaughtering animals. When the
soldiers left, at least 175 men, women and children were dead,
according to a 1970 Army report, although later investigations put
the toll as high as 500.
   The Army charged T'Souvas with premediated murder of two
unidentified Vietnamese with a machine gun. He was one of nine
enlisted men charged.
   George T. Davis, the attorney who represented T'Souvas in the
1970 Army hearing, gave this account Monday:
   ``On the way out (of the village) T'Souvas saw two small
children lying in the road with their intestines hanging out. In an
emotional reaction, he took his M-16 and killed both to put them
out of their misery.''
   Lt. William Calley Jr. was convicted of killing at least 22
civilians at My Lai. Of the enlisted men, two soldiers were
acquitted and the charges against T'Souvas and the six others were
dropped. All were given honorable discharges.
   Calley was ordered to spend life in prison, but President
Richard Nixon later reduced his sentence to 20 years. He actually
served three years under house arrest at Fort Benning, Ga. He was
released when his conviction was overturned by a federal district
judge, and he was not returned to house arrest when an appeals
court reinstated the conviction.
   Relatives of T'Souvas said that while he awaited the
court-martial at Fort McPherson, Ga., he lived in an Atlanta
commune, where he met and married a woman named Rebecca. Both later
spent time in jail on marijuana charges before they moved to
California, they said.
   They raised two children and T'Souvas worked in a bakery and at
various other jobs before their marriage broke up, said Lynn
T'Souvas, an aunt.
   About four years ago, he met a carnival worker, Kathleen
T'Souvas, now 36, the woman Pittsburgh police have charged with
shooting him.
   Even though T'Souvas never divorced, family members said
Kathleen assumed his last name.
   ``She was more like a buddy than a wife, a drinking buddy,'' his
father said.
   ``She did nothing but drag him down,'' his aunt said.
``Everybody tried to warn him. She drank nothing but straight vodka
and she didn't care if she had a roof over her head or shoes on her
feet as long as she had her vodka. I saw her fight him over a drink
several times.''
   Police said the couple left California in August 1987,
criss-crossing the country in a van for several months before
arriving in Pittsburgh, where T'Souvas hoped to get a construction
job.
   Police said Kathleen's diary showed they lived in the van, often
parking it near Three Rivers Stadium, as they fished in the rivers,
sold their blood for money and worked part-time in a food kitchen
for the homeless.
   After the van broke down they built a makeshift shelter on the
banks of the Monongahela River, according to police.
   On Sept. 3, police said, the couple and a homeless man, David
Bozic, 42, spent the day drinking, fishing and using Bozic's
.22-caliber pistol to shoot rats and cans under a bridge.
   While Bozic was gone to get food, police said, the couple argued
over a bottle of vodka T'Souvas had. Police said the woman took
Bozic's gun and shot T'Souvas once in the head.
   Bozic said he didn't realize T'Souvas was dead until the next
morning, when the woman said she couldn't rouse him, authorities
said.
   Kathleen T'Souvas was charged with criminal homicide and was
being held without bail at the Allegheny County Jail. A coroner's
hearing is scheduled Thursday.
   William T'Souvas said he talked to his son a few days before his
death.
   ``I just tried to tell him to put it together and come home,''
the father said. ``I sent him some money, but he never came.''

<HEAD>Two F-14 Jets Crash In Separate Accidents</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to UPDATE with third crash in Utah; no
injuries. ADDS 2 grafs on end with details.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coast Guard and Navy aircraft and vessels today searched for a
crewman missing from an F-14 jet fighter that plunged into the
Atlantic Ocean off North Carolina while practicing combat
maneuvers, killing his crewmate, officials said.
   Six people were injured in another F-14 crash Monday after two
Navy aviators bailed out of their jet over an airfield in the San
Diego suburb of El Cajon, sending it smashing into a hangar. And a
pilot in Utah escaped injury today in a third military training
flight in two days.
   The crash off Hatteras, N.C., occurred Monday afternoon 22 miles
east of Oregon Inlet, the Navy said. A fishing boat picked up a
crewman, who was pronounced dead.
   The identity of the dead aviator and his missing crewmate were
not released pending notification of relatives.
   Five people, including the two Navy fliers, remained
hospitalized today following the crash Monday morning in El Cajon
15 miles east of San Diego.
   The $35 million jet crashed upside down into hangars at
Gillespie Field and exploded. The blaze ignited by the crash
destroyed a hangar and an attached extension, but spared a nearby
restaurant.
   Authorities said the two crewman tried to guide the jet to the
runway at Gillespie Field before bailing out.
   Capt. Gary Hughes, commanding officer of Naval Air Station
Miramar, said he was grateful there weren't more injuries,
``particularly when you're this close to El Cajon. It's a very
populated area.''
   The jet passed within a mile of an elementary school.
   ``I thought they were just doing tricks. And then we saw the
parachutes,'' said Washington Moscuso, a sixth-grader at Ballantyne
Elementary School.
   In the Atlantic accident, Lt. Cmdr. Mike John, a spokesman for
the Navy's Atlantic Fleet air force in Norfolk, Va., said the plane
was engaged in mock dogfights with another F-14 and an A-4 jet in
restricted military airspace off the North Carolina coast.
   ``It was flying a routine training mission,'' John said.
   The cause of the crash was not determined, officials said. The
aircraft sank soon after impact, John said.
   The twin-engine supersonic fighter was attached to Fighter
Squadron 143 at Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach, Va.
   In northern Utah today, an F-16A jet fighter crashed west of
Hill Air Force Base after the pilot bailed out, a base spokeswoman
said. The aircraft, assigned to Hill's 388th Tactical Fighter Wing,
was on a routine training mission.
   Spokeswoman Silvia Le Mons-Liddle said the plane went down about
25 miles west of the base about 9:05 a.m. MDT. She said the crash
site was in or near the Promontory Mountains, which are on a
peninsula jutting into the Great Salt Lake, but she declined to be
more specific.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Housing Bias Legislation, Lauds King</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation Tuesday
putting new enforcement teeth in the open-housing law Congress
passed in the wake of Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1968 assassination.
   Standing with members of Congress in the White House Rose
Garden, Reagan hailed the newly enacted bill as ``the most
important civil rights legislation in 20 years.''
   Singling out Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who had accompanied King to
Washington for the civil rights leader's ``I Have a Dream'' speech
in 1963, the president said the legislation ``has brought us one
step closer to realizing Martin Luther King's dream.''
   The measure, which was passed overwhelmingly by the House and
Senate, extends anti-discrimination protections to the handicapped
and to families with children. It also empowers the federal
government _ for the first time _ to seek fines of up to $100,000
against individuals or organizations found to have engaged in a
pattern of housing discrimination.
   Under the open-housing provision of the Civil Rights Act of
1968, the government was given only a mediating role in housing
discrimination disputes.
   ``Discrimination is particularly tragic when it means a family
is refused housing near good schools, a good job or simply in a
better neighborhood to raise children,'' Reagan said. ``This bill
is the product of years of bipartisan work, and repairs a
significant ... defect in civil rights law.''
   He said that while the 1968 law was well-intentioned, ``it
lacked teeth. Its concilation provisions were ineffective when
used.''
   Reagan said that he and Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce had
``devoted eight years'' to seeking improvements in the 1968 law,
``to redress the absence of penalties and the inability of the
government to initiate actions except when `a pattern of
dsicrimination' could be proven.''
   Under the bill he signed Tuesday, the Department of Housing and
Urban Development will have authority to initiate enforcement
actions and to seek penalties against individuals, businesses or
organizations that discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex or
national origin in the sale, rental or financing of housing.
   It authorizes civil penalties, which could be recommended
following an agency administrative enforcement process, of up to
$10,000 or a first offense, $25,000 for a second and up to $50,000
for a third.
   In instances where a pattern of discrimination has been alleged,
the government could seek up to $50,000 for a first offense and as
much as $100,000 for subsequent offenses.
   Besides strengthening existing provisions in law dealing with
racial discrimination, the measure protects the handicapped against
housing bias. For instance, a landlord could be considered to be in
violation if he refused to make reasonable modifications in
premises to accommodate the handicapped.
   Under the section protecting families with children from
discrimination in the sale, rental or financing of housing,
buildings that are now ``adult only'' could exclude children only
if the managers or owners of these structures adopted a policy to
rent or sell to the elderly only.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who took part in the ceremony, said
that ``today, there is wide agreement after nearly two decades of
experience that the Fair Housing Act has not been invested with
adequate enforcement remedies. ... Today, we give the law the tools
needed to make its promise a reality for all of our families.''
   Reagan used the occasion to throw a bouquet in the direction of
Vice President George Bush, who was out on the campaign trail as
the Republican presidential nominee.
   ``The Civil Rights Act of 1968 included for the first time in
our history a fair housing provision. That was a major achievement,
one that many members of Congress _ including a young congressman
named George Bush _ had to show enormous courage to vote for,'' the
president said.
   And then he called people's attention to the presence on the
platform of Lewis, who was among the many young blacks who joined
King in the civil rights leader's battles of the 1950s and '60s.
   ``Twenty-five years ago, as a young leader of the civil rights
movement, Congressman Lewis was standing in this very Rose Garden
pressing for federal action to eliminate housing discrimination,''
he said.
   ``To all of you and to everyone involved in the passage of this
legislation, the nation says thank you.''

<HEAD>Compelling Evidence Iraq Used Chemical Weapons, Shultz Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George Shultz said Tuesday
the United States has ``compelling'' evidence that Iraq has used
chemical weapons against its Kurdish citizens.
   But he said the United Nations should conduct its own probe
before being asked to condemn Iraq for alleged genocide.
   Several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee said, however,
that an immediate Security Council session is imperative to make
the case against Iraq.
   Shultz contended that it is important that the world body
investigate the facts independently.
   ``Not everybody agrees with what we say the facts are,'' Shultz
told the committee. He added that the government of Turkey has said
it can find no evidence among the Kurdish refugees fleeing from
Iraq that chemical weapons were used against them.
   ``What you want is for the United Nations to form a team and go
an see what the facts are,'' Shultz said.
   Shultz commented as senator after senator said the evidence the
United States possesses appears to be solid and should be presented
to the Security Council now, to bring into focus the question of
whether Iraq is subjecting its Kurdish minority to a deliberate
campaign of genocide.
   Shultz said the United States reached the conclusion Iraq is
using chemical weapons against the Kurds based on its own
examination of Kurdish refugees inside Turkey and on ``other
evidence which to me seems to be compelling.''
   ``I feel our evidence is quite convincing ...,'' he said. ``But
we're not in a position to make that public.''
   Shultz noted that the U.N. conducted an earlier investigation
into accusations that Iraq had used chemical weapons in its war
with Iran and concluded such weapons were in fact used.

   Confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed
Ali Hamadi proudly pointed out the blood of a slain U.S. hostage
and indicated he was happy the Navy diver was dead, an American
witness testified Tuesday.
   Flight engineer Benjamin Zimmermann described how he and Hamadi
walked around the front of the TWA aircraft in Algeria in June
1985, and Hamadi showed him the blood left by the shooting death of
U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem.
   ``Mr. Hamadi joyfully pointed to the blood running down the
door. And with the pistol he pointed, he indicated, he was very
proud of this gun and of him having caused this,'' Zimmermann told
the court.
   Stethem, of Waldorf, Md., was shot to death during the June 1985
hijacking of TWA Flight 847. His body was thrown onto the runway in
Beirut before the plane went to Algiers. In previous testimony,
Flight 847 pilot John Testrake identified Hamadi as Stethem's
killer.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is on trial on air piracy and
murder charges. He has admitted to the court that he was one of the
two hijackers, but he denied killing Stethem.
   Zimmermann of Cascade, Idaho, was the only witness Tuesday. He
was the flight engineer aboard the Athens-to-Rome flight when it
was hijacked to Beirut on June 14, 1985. He said he was kicked and
pistol-whipped during the ordeal.
   The Arab hijackers held 39 Americans hostage for 17 days. During
the hijacking, the jet flew to Beirut, then to Algeria, then back
to Beirut.
   As Tuesday's court session began, Chief Judge Hainer
Mueckenberger welcomed the release of West German hostage Rudolf
Cordes in Beirut. Cordes was freed Monday after 20 months of
captivity.
   Cordes and another West German, Alfred Schmidt, were kidnapped
in Beirut in January 1987 soon Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt
Airport with explosives in his luggage. Hamadi's older brother,
Abbas, was convicted by a Duesseldorf court of helping kidnap
Schmidt and Cordes in a bid to free his brother.
   Schmidt was released Sept. 7, 1987 in what his kidnappers said
was a ``good will gesture.'' Cordes' captors referred to the Hamadi
trial when they freed Cordes on Monday. In a note issued in Beirut,
the kidnappers said if Hamadi's freedom can't be gained legally
they will again resort to violence.
   ``This happy news means an end to endless speculation about what
influence Cordes' captivity might have had on these proceedings,''
judge Mueckenberger said Tuesday, adding that ``outside elements''
had never influenced the court.
   Zimmermann said he was stunned by Hamadi's behavior in pointing
out the blood. ``I wondered how he expected me to respond to him.
It was as if he wanted congratulations. It seemed to be a great
moment to him, what that blood represented to him,'' Zimmermann
said.
   When asked by the judge if he wished to comment on the
testimony, Hamadi said: ``There is a lot of conflicting testimony,
but I have nothing to say.''
   Zimmerman said the hijackers beat him and other passengers
during the ordeal. ``I would be hit on the side of the head with
the gun butt. When I would bend forward the blows would go down my
back,'' he told the court.
   Zimmermann described the events that led up to Stethem's death.
   He said that when negotiations for fuel with the tower in Beirut
went too slowly, Hamadi shouted ``Get up! Get up!'' to Stethem. By
that time, according to other testimony, Stethem had been severely
beaten by the two hijackers.
   Zimmermann said the hijackers then left the cockpit.
   ``I heard a pop. I heard someone exhale very loudly. I heard it
above the engine noises. The shock of that noise was added to by
the co-pilot on the radio stating that we needed fuel because they
were killing passengers,'' Zimmermann told the court. He added in
later testimony that he did not know which of the hijackers had the
pistol just before the sailor was shot.
   ``They exchanged the pistol frequently so it was hard to
determine who had it when,'' Zimmermann said.
   Zimmermann, echoing earlier testimony from the plane's captain,
said the hijackers seemed well-trained and familiar with the
aircraft.
   ``Someone had taught them about the airplane. They knew where
the crash axe should have been stored,'' said Zimmermann, who added
that he hid the ax after realizing that the plane was being
commandeered.
   Testrake testified Monday that he believed Hamadi shot Stethem
because Hamadi seemed to enjoy inflicting violence on the
passengers and crew.

   Salvadoran presidential candidate Fidel Chavez
Mena said Tuesday the Nicaraguan government continues to support
the leftist guerrilla movement in his homeland.
   Chevez Mena, candidate of the ruling Christian Democratic party
in El Salvador, said the insurgents nonetheless are a far less
potent force than they were earlier in the decade.
   While giving no specifics, Chevez Mena said the leftist
Sandinista government in Managua ``continues to give support in one
way or another'' to the rebels and ``have not concealed their
sympathy'' for the insurgents' program.
   Chevez Mena, a former foreign minister and planning minister,
told reporters the Sandinistas have shown no inclination to abide
by the provisions of the Central American peace plan they signed
last year.
   ``I have to regret how Nicaragua, instead of making their
process more flexible, becomes more radical every day,'' he said.
   He said the peace accord signed by the region's five presidents
``deligitimized'' the rebel forces because it confirmed the need
for democratic solutions to the region's problems.
   One measure of how much the insurgent threat has been reduced,
Chavez Mena said, is that he can travel almost anywhere in the
country ``practically without risk.''
   Chevez Mena expressed confidence that he and his party will
prevail in presidential elections next March.
   In contrast to other contenders, including the rightist ARENA
party, Chavez Mena said he represents the ``great center'' of the
Salvadoran political spectrum that reflects the sentiments of most
of his countrymen.
   He said the ARENA victory in legislative elections last March
was a ``punishment vote'' against the Christian Democrats, based on
the party's inability to move quickly enough to solve economic and
social problems.
   He acknowledged that unemployment and other social problems
remain acute but said the Salvadoran people will take the vote for
president next year more seriously and will give the Christian
Democrats another five-year term in office.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill Protecting Aviation Workers Who Report Safety
Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed legislation Tuesday barring
airlines, aircraft manufacturers and other aviation companies from
retaliating against employees who complain to the government about
safety problems.
   The measure prohibits employers from firing or taking other
actions against workers who notify government agencies about what
they believe are safety problems, or who refuse to allow an
aircraft to operate because they believe a hazardous condition
exists.
   The bill, passed on a voice vote, gained momentum this year
after lawmakers heard from workers, including pilots and other
employees of Eastern Airlines, who complained that pressure was
placed by management on those who object to safety problems.
   ``It is imperative employees feel they can come to the Federal
Aviation Administration or to Congress with their safety concerns
so the traveling public can be protected,'' said Rep. Glenn
Anderson, D-Calif., chairman of the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee.
   The bill's future is uncertain because there is no similar
Senate version. There is a much broader Senate measure that would
protect all private-sector whistleblowers, including aviation
industry workers, but that bill seems unlikely to pass this year.
   The House bill would allow workers to appeal to the Labor
Department if they believe they have lost their jobs or been
punished because they complained about safety problems.
   A party dissatisfied with the labor secretary's decision could
appeal to an administrative law judge within the department, and
ultimately to the courts.
   If a worker is found to have brought his complaint in bad faith,
the employee can be held liable for the company's legal fees, up to
$5,000.

   A bandit stole a United
Parcel Service truck and posed as a deliveryman to rob a woman of
$40,000 in jewels, authorities said Tuesday.
   The UPS driver was kidnapped Monday afternoon while making a
delivery in Torrance, said Los Angeles Sheriff's Deputy Kathryn
Nielsen. The UPS Gardena office asked that the driver's name be
withheld for his safety.
   ``The driver was handcuffed and placed in back of the van, then
the suspect drove to Rolling Hills Estates and robbed a woman,''
Ms. Nielsen said.
   Sandra Del Conte, 44, had just returned home, in an exclusive
area 25 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles, when the phony
driver approached and pulled a gun, the deputy said.
   ``The suspect, who apparently had been waiting in the UPS van
outside the house, approached her carrying a large box. He then
pulled a gun, forced her into house and handcuffed her to a pool
table,'' the deputy said.
   The robber took $40,000 in jewelry and fled in the UPS van,
which was found a short distance away with the driver still
handcuffed inside, Ms. Nielsen said.
   The driver and Ms. Del Conte were not injured, investigators
said.

   Here is a sampling of recent foreign press comment on the U.S.
presidential race between Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican
George Bush:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FRANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Jan Krauze, writing from Washington in Le Monde (independent,
left of center) of Paris, Sept. 12: ``Dukakis is at the top,
Dukakis is at the bottom. Bush is on the ground, Bush is in the
sky. For several months, the two candidates for the American
presidential election have been perched at the two ends of a
see-saw, rising and falling with the polls, while the commentators
flock alternatively in one direction or the other, amplifying these
movements to an extreme with a surprising unanimity. ...
   ``There is really no reason for this game of teeter-totter to
stop. The voters seem to be looking with a gloomy and sceptical eye
at these two candidates scrambling to seduce them, who both present
themselves as representatives of the fair middle, the `main stream'
of opinion, but who are scarcely successful in attracting that
opinion; two men who, failing to convince by their own qualities,
apply themselves, not without success, to denouncing the faults of
their rival and throwing low blows. The seesaw is likely to stay in
movement, with more and more grating.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ARABS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Arab editorialists reacted strongly to what Bush and Dukakis
told a B'Nai B'rith assembly Sept. 7 in Baltimore. Here is some of
what Arab newspaper editorials had to say:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JORDAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Jordan Times (liberal, pro-government) of Amman, Sept. 10:
``The performance of both ... U.S. presidential contenders before
B'nai B'rith last Wednesday was a misfortune for American
statesmanship. The two gentlemen acted more like gladiators than
responsible leaders of their respective parties.
   ``Their willingness to outbid one another in support of Israel
and its bankrupt policies shocked all of us who watched it with
dismay and disbelief. Mr. Bush assured the Jewish constituency in
the United States, and through them Israel, that under his
administration the United States would neither accept an effective
United Nations role in settling the Arab-Israeli conflict nor
accept a Palestinian state in the West Bank.
   ``His reasoning was unfortunate and untenable. Interpreting U.N.
involvement in the Middle East peace process as tantamount to
imposing a solution on Israel is most regrettable. Calling any
future Palestinian state a `threat' to Israel is also unwarranted.
How can a truncated and demilitarized state pose a threat to
Israel, a country with nuclear capabilities?
   ``By insinuating that such a state would also threaten the
security and stability of Jordan, Mr. Bush went beyond the realm of
reality. ...
   ``Gov. Dukakis sadly attempted to outbid Mr. Bush in support of
Israel. For by asserting that Washington will never accept a
solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, no matter how just and
legitimate, if it is rejected by Israel, Mr. Dukakis has
permanently mortgaged his country's national interests to Israel. .
..
   ``It is sad to see would-be statesmen so lose sight of all
long-term interests, their own included, in the short-term hunt for
votes.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Al-Rai (pro-government) of Amman, Sept. 10: ``Statements by
both U.S. president candidates ... on the Palestinian issue assures
us of the absence of American truthfulness and sincerity toward the
Palestinian people in particular and the Arab world in general.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EGYPT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Al-Akhbar (state-owned) of Cairo, Sept. 11 _ ``Jews in America
are a minority, they cannot tilt the balance in favor of either
candidate, but their influence is decisive. ...
   ``That is why each candidate seeks to win Israel friendship and
outbids the other for winning the influence of American Jews.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>KUWAIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Kuwait Times (independent), Sept. 10: ``A good look at the
Bush-Dukakis play-acting would, in our opinion, leave one too
dispirited to comment. What they say is, in the first place, so
obviously self-contradictory as to mean nothing at all. The two
have no fresh ideas, no strategies, no sense of direction and
absolutely no sense of purpose.
   ``It is no exaggeration to say that Bush shows little
understanding of what the Palestine question is and Dukakis reminds
that his sense of the world never went beyond his own navel.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>UNITED ARAB EMIRATES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Al-Wehda (conservative), Sept. 10: ``It has become clear that
the future president of the United States intends to distort
reality and insists on overshooting facts and ignoring the
legitimate Palestinian rights.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BAHRAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Gulf Daily News (conservative), Sept. 10: ``While few rules
exist in American political circles whenever the election circus
hits town, this year's presidential contenders have been stronger
in their verbal attacks on the Palestinian situation than in
previous polling pledges.
   ``Television news films screened in the U.S. have, in recent
months, shown a little of the day-to-day violent and ruthless
suppression of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories.
   ``And yet both Bush and Dukakis have, by making biased and
reckless speeches, spelled out a very clear lack of understanding
of an issue at the center of the whole Middle East peace question.
   ``The next man in the White House, whether it be Bush or
Dukakis, will have to tackle the Middle East situation very
differently if he hopes to gain the help and friendship of anyone

   _Arab News (English-language, conservative), Sept. 13: ``As the
U.S. presidential campaign heats up, both the Republican and
Democratic candidates have been falling over each other in
professing their unswerving support to the state of Israel. ...
   ``After Republican Bush's assertion against the creation of a
Palestinian state, a willing Dukakis has gone a step further to
declare that he will shift the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to
occupied Jerusalem, a move resisted so far by successive Republican
and Democratic administrations. Blinded by his electoral interests
to appease a seemingly all-powerful Jewish lobby, Dukakis, it
appears, has failed to see the grave implications of such a move
for the U.S. policy in the Middle East. ...
   ``Although Dukakis found it easy to shrug off the probable
reaction such a U.S. decision would provoke in the Arab and Moslem
world, any U.S. backing for the usurpation (Israeli annexation) of
the Holy City would set off a chain reaction which could be
disastrous for American economic and strategic interests in the
region.''

   The United States plans to extend trade
preferences soon to Guyana under the Caribbean Basin Initiative,
President Reagan told Guyanan President Hugh Desmond Hoyte on
Tuesday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan told Hoyte of
the U.S. plan during a brief meeting at the White House. He said
the products to which the trade preferences will apply will be
announced later.
   The United States has given Guyana, a nation on the northeast
coast of South America, $14 million in food aid since 1986.
   Fitzwater said Reagan ``expressed his gratification at the state
of our relations'' with Guyana during the brief meeting.
   The Caribbean Basin Initiative, an administration program
enacted by Congress during Reagan's first term, is a system of
economic aid to countries of the region through trade preferences
and other forms of assistance.

   The British Royal Navy is hoping the
Boy Scouts and the local PTO can help them out.
   The Royal Navy wants to take back from the town a bell that once
rang aboard the destroyer HMS Campbeltown. The bell was one of 50
returned to the United States by the Royal Navy after World War II.
All were taken from the 50 U.S. Navy destroyers given to the United
Kingdom under a lend-lease program in 1940.
   The Royal Navy plans to commission a new HMS Campbeltown in
March and would like the original bell. British officials have
offered a replica.
   Members of the Campbelltown Fire Co., the bell's caretaker, said
the town should decide.
   At a meeting Monday night, the fire company put the issue to a
committee of representatives from the Boy Scouts, the South
Londonderry Township School Board, the American Legion, the fire
company, fire company auxiliary, Parent-Teacher Organization,
Campbelltown Water Co. and a justice of the peace.
   The new committee will be asked to decide if the issue should be
put to a town vote.

   A sixth-grade class of gifted and talented
students has been forced to summon all its energy this week _ just
to concentrate.
   For two weeks, teacher Sharon Arnold's 21 students have been
meeting under a stairwell at Lakewood Elementary School as they
await a portable classroom.
   The students have had to put up with noisy halls between
classes, no air conditioning and poor lighting.
   Penumbra, which means ``a space of partial illumination,'' was
one of the vocabulary words during a morning reading lesson, made
more difficult by burned-out light bulbs.
   ``Now when your parents ask you about your classroom at school,
you can tell them it's a penumbra,'' Ms. Arnold told the students.
``At least you'll have a good vocabulary, no matter where we're
having class.''

   Children and monks joined thousands of
striking civil servants who marched through Rangoon on Tuesday to
demand the government resign and be replaced by an interim
administration to supervise multiparty elections.
   Opposition leaders told a new Parliament-appointed election
commission that neither they nor the people will accept elections
organized by the government.
   International telephone and telex lines from Rangoon were cut
off Tuesday, but it was not known if they were deliberately
disrupted, since communications with Burma normally are poor.
   Residents of the capital were hoarding food and cutting down on
rice consumption as transportation strikes pushed up the prices of
essential items. About 75 people _ including two Buddhist monks _
began a two-day pro-democracy hunger strike outside city hall. On
Monday, more than 1,000 children ending a 36-hour fast gathered at
the Rangoon General Hospital shouting ``Give Us Democracy!'' and
``Give Us Interim Government!''
   Tens of thousands of striking government workers, students,
medical personnel, children and monks staged peaceful
demonstrations in Rangoon Tuesday against President Maung Maung and
his ruling Burma Socialist Program Party.
   Opposition leaders Aung Gyi, Aung San Suu Kyi and former Defense
Minister Tin Oo told the election commission they rejected the
government's promise to end 26 years of one-party rule and hold
elections as early as late October.
   The three told the commission that polling could not be held
amidst the country's political turmoil and violence, Aung Gyi said,
and that they will not support or participate in elections
organized by the government. In a letter to Maung Maung on Monday,
the opposition demanded an interim government.
   The three leaders also said it would be unfair to hold the
elections before opposition groups form parties and raise funds to
compete against ruling party candidates, state-run Radio Rangoon
reported.
   Aung Gyi said he told election commission chairman Ba Htay, a
retired financial commissioner under a pre-1962 civilian government:
   ``I know you and I respect your integrity and I am confident you
want to hold a free and fair election, but after 26 years of this
rule, most people in the country do not know you and will not have
confidence. More so, people do not trust any government-appointed
commission.'' Like the other four elderly commission members, Ba
Htay is regarded as politically neutral.
   In this city of 3.5 million, strikes by transportation workers
and a lack of fuel have restricted food deliveries from the
countryside. The resulting shortages and an increase in the price
of staples such as rice have forced residents to eat porridge or
gruel and to hoard food.
   A 4.4-pound bag of rice that cost $1.70 a month ago now costs
$5.80, said a Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
He said gasoline was selling for $16 a gallon on the black market,
compared to $1 a year ago.
   The last multiparty elections in Burma were held Feb. 6, 1960,
when former Prime Minister U Nu's Clean Anti-Fascist People's
Freedom League won a landslide victory over an army-backed party.
   Gen. Ne Win led the March 1962 coup that toppled U Nu. The
military crushed dissent and pursued rigid policies that made
Burma, once one of Asia's richest countries, one of the world's
poorest nations.
   In September 1987, students staged riots against the
government's economic policies, followed by widespread protests in
March and in June. After Ne Win resigned July 23, the party chose
hardliner Sein Lwin to succeed him. After only 17 days in office
and massive anti-government protests, Sein Lwin was replaced on
Aug. 19 by Maung Maung, the first civilian leader since U Nu.

   A federal judge has thrown out a $4 billion
libel lawsuit brought by the inventor of the Nautilus exercise
machine, who claimed he was defamed in a ``20-20'' news program.
   Nothing in the episode damaged Arthur Jones' reputation, U.S.
District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich said in a ruling last week.
   Jones said Tuesday from his ranch near Ocala that his attorney
would appeal.
   ``I'm not happy with the judge's ruling ... in a case where
we're patently right and they're patently wrong,'' he said. ``We'll
take it clear to the Supreme Court if we have to.''
   The broadcast concerned Jones' attempts to save 63 baby West
African elephants by flying them from Zimbabwe to his ranch. The
elephants had been slated for slaughter to control the size of the
herd.
   In 1984, ``20-20'' broadcast a segment about Jones' efforts to
save the animals. In a March 1987 follow-up, the ABC show revealed
some elephants were being sold from Jones' ranch.
   Reporter Roger Caras said several elephants had gone to small
circuses, ``a fate worse than death.'' In an on-air exchange with
anchor Barbara Walters, Caras said Jones should have kept the
elephants for good, as had been implied from the beginning.
   Jones was quoted as saying that he did not have control of the
animals at the time they were being sold because he was selling
business assets. But the company buying the assets told ABC it was
not responsible for selling the elephants.
   Two weeks after the segment aired, Jones sued, saying the show
deliberately made him seem dishonest and cruel.
   ``The court finds that a reasonable person would not have
intrepreted the broadcast, in whole or in part, as being
defamatory,'' Ms. Kovachevich wrote. She found that the statements
in the broadcast were either constitutionally protected opinion or
not damaging to Jones' reputation.

<HEAD>Those Most Mentally Ill Get Worst Care, Groups Contend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The most seriously mentally ill patients in
the United States tend to get the worst treatment largely because
so many good psychiatrists leave public hospitals to make more
money in private practice, two advocacy groups contended Tuesday.
   ``The lack of adequate services for the seriously mentally ill
is the major failure of American medicine and social services,''
the Public Citizen Health Research Group and the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill said in a report.
   Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, co-founder with Ralph Nader of the Public
Citizen health group, called for ``using the leverage of federal
funding to force'' psychiatrists to devote a certain amount of time
to working in public mental health facilities.
   At a news conference and in a subsequent interview, Wolfe said
medical schools in general are more heavily subsidized by federal
money than other professional schools and that psychiatric training
is the most heavily subsidized of the medical specialities.
   ``It's almost impossible to get competent psychiatrists in
public practice in some states,'' said E. Fuller Torrey, a
psychiatrist and a co-author of the report. He said it would not be
too much to require psychiatrists to devote four or five hours a
month to public practice in return for having their education
subsidized by tax money.
   The report itself said the failure to provide adequate care ``is
particularly striking since we now know that the majority of these
people can be successfully treated and rehabilitated.''
   Expanding on a ranking system first used in 1986, a new survey
by the groups concluded that Rhode Island, Wisconsin, New
Hampshire, Maine, Vermont and Connecticut are the best at providing
services.
   Lowest-rated in the survey were Hawaii, Arizona, the District of
Columbia, Delaware, Wyoming, Idaho and Mississippi.
   But Torrey said being at the top of the list was not much to
crow about. ``When most are giving third- and fourth-class care,
states that are delivering second-class care look pretty good. It's
a little like being the smartest kid in the dumb class at school,''
he said.
   The report said: ``In general, it can be said that hospital care
for the seriously mentally ill in state mental hospitals is
somewhat worse than it was two years ago, while outpatient services
are modestly better.
   ``Rehabilitation services and housing for the seriously mentally
ill remain on the best of days seriously deficient and on the worst
of days abysmal,'' it said.
   ``The reasons for the general deterioration of hospital care
center primarily on staffing deficiencies, especially in nursing
and psychiatry,'' the report said. ``In both cases, the
deficiencies are being exacerbated by the mushrooming of private
psychiatric hospitals which are taking the best staff from the
public sector with the lure of higher wages.''
   It attributed marginal improvement in outpatient services ``to
increased public attention to the sorry plight of the homeless
mentally ill, an issue which has moved from the back alleys and
grates of the city to the front pages of its newspapers.''
   The report said conservative estimates suggest that nearly 2
million people in the United States are seriously mentally ill,
with 8 percent of them hospitalized.
   ``Approximately one-third of homeless individuals are seriously
mentally ill,'' the report said. ``Their visibility on America's
streets is a poignant reminder of the debacle of
deinstitutionalization and failure of federally funded community
mental health centers.''
   Laurie M. Flynn, director of the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill, noted that her organization is made up of 70,000
families of people suffering from mental illness.
   ``For us the lack of services is a personal and family
tragedy,'' she said.
   The overall state rankings were based on a composite figure
drawn by awarding points ranging from zero to five in each of four
categories: hospital care, outpatient services, rehabilitation and
housing.
   The report relied on questionnaires to state mental health
directors, various government surveys and visits to 35 states and
the District of Columbia. The report said 82 percent of the state
mental health directors returned nine-page questionnaires _ when
guaranteed anonymity _ even though their national organization did
not endorse the survey.

   Here are state-by-state rankings on the level
of care provided for the seriously mentally ill as compiled by
Public Citizen Health Research Group and the National Alliance for
the Mentally Ill.
   The rankings were based on a composite figure drawn by assigning
a zero to five-point value in each of four categories: hospital
care, outpatient services, rehabilitation and housing.
   Data collection methods included questionnaires to state mental
health directors and others, various government surveys and visits
to 35 states and the District of Columbia.
   When states have an equal number of points, they were ranked
according to per capita income, with poor states ranked higher on
the assumption that, all other things being equal, wealthy states
should do better than poorer states.
   The number in brackets is the 1986 ranking. The groups said
inclusion of additional data in the 1988 figures could account for
some changes in position rather than actual improvement or
worsening of services.

   The Senate, bowing to a veto threat and the
House's will, today retreated from its position that the federal
Medicaid program should fund abortions for poor victims of rape and
incest.
   The Senate voted 47-43 to drop an amendment that would have
liberalized the current policy of federal funds only when abortion
is necessary to save a woman's life.
   In July, the Senate voted 73-19 to expand Medicaid to pay for
abortions in promptly reported cases of rape or incest. States
would have had the option of retaining the current, more limited
policy.
   The abortion controversy had been holding up a massive $140
billion spending bill meant to keep the departments of Labor,
Health and Human Services, and Education in business during fiscal
1989, which starts Oct. 1.
   The bill contains money for college loans, disadvantaged
children, job training and AIDS research and education, among other
things.
   President Reagan has repeatedly said he would veto the entire
Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill if it came to him with the
Senate abortion provision. The latest threat came in a letter Sept.
7 to congressional leaders.
   The House on Friday refused 216-166 to go along with the Senate
expansion.
   Three hours of often emotional debate preceded today's vote,
with some senators decrying abortion and others maintaining that
poor women in desperate circumstances deserve access to a legal
medical option.
   ``The question is, is a child conceived by rape any less of a
human being than one who is not?'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
``One atrocity... doesn't justify another. Rape doesn't justify
murder.''
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., countered that it ``defies all
common sense'' not to permit federal payments for ``the most narrow
exceptions under the most extraordinary and dismal of
circumstances.''
   Fourteen states and the District of Columbia pay for Medicaid
abortions, but only receive federal reimbursement for
life-threatening cases. The Senate vote in July was the first time
since 1981 that either chamber had approved more liberal
eligibility.

   Here are major provisions of the Fair Housing
Amendments Act of 1988, which President Reagan signed into law
Tuesday:
   _Protection against housing discrimination would cover the
disabled and handicapped and families with children under age 18.
Current law already protects against discrimination because of
race, sex, religion or national origin.
   _The secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development would try to win a conciliation agreement after a
complaint if filed. If that effort fails, the secretary or any
party could take the case to an independent administrative law
judge in HUD or to a U.S. district court.
   _If the administrative judge finds that someone has engaged or
is about to engage in a discriminatory practice, he shall order
appropriate relief, which may include actual damages, an injunction
or civil penalties.
   _The maximum fines would be $10,000 for a first violation,
$25,000 for a second violation within a five-year period and
$50,000 for two or more violations within a seven-year period.
Civil penalties ranging from $10,000 for a first offense to
$100,000 for succeeding offenses would be authorized in cases where
a ``pattern or practice'' of discrimination has been proved.
   _The administrative law judge's ruling would be subject to
review by a federal appellate court.
   _A U.S. district judge could impose the added penalty of
punitive damage.
   _New buildings with four or move units must be constructed so
they are readily accessible to the handicapped. Doors must be wide
enough to accommodate wheelchairs; switches and outlets must be in
accessible locations; bathroom walls must be reinforced to allow
for installation of grab bars. This would apply to dwellings set
for occupancy 30 months after the law's enactment.
   _Disabled tenants would have the right to make reasonable
modifications to a dwelling at their own expense. The tenants would
have to agree to restore the property to its original condition
when they leave.
   _Children could be barred from housing intended for the elderly,
but that would be the only exception to an open-housing policy for
those 18 and under. Housing for the elderly is defined as a
community where at least 80 percent of the dwellings are occupied
by at least one person age 55 or older, and significant facilities
and services are provided; or those occupied solely by people age
62 and older.

session with recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Speaker Jim Wright said the pledge, which has become an item of
controversy in the presidential campaign, would be recited on the
House floor at the beginning of each day's session until Congress
adjourns next month.
   But Wright, D-Texas, also lashed out harshly at Republicans who
have sought to make the pledge an issue, saying such efforts are
``childish, immature and mean-spirited as a person can be.''
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., held his hand over his
heart as he led about three dozen lawmakers in reciting the 31-word
pledge. Montgomery's podium was turned sideways from its normal
position so he could see the large U.S. flag that hangs behind the
speaker's chair.
   The pledge was to be led on Wednesday by Rep. Jerry Lewis,
R-Calif., with Democrats and Republicans alternating days through
the end of the session. The members in the chamber Tuesday appeared
to be roughly equally divided between the two parties.
   Rep. John Rowland, R-Conn., who brought the pledge squabble to
the House chamber last week, called it a historic moment and said
he would press to make the recitation a daily fixture. Wright
promised that such a rules change would be considered through
normal channels.
   ``I compliment the speaker for recognizing that the dignity and
integrity of the House would be enhanced by the recitation of the
Pledge of Allegiance at the beginning of each session day,''
Rowland said.
   The pledge has become the centerpiece of an argument, begun in
the presidential campaign, over whether Democrats or Republicans
are more patriotic.
   Republican nominee George Bush began the fight by criticizing
Democrat Michael Dukakis for vetoing a bill in 1977 that would have
penalized teachers for not leading the pledge in Massachusetts
schools. Dukakis, the governor, said he vetoed the bill because it
was unconstitutional, and has labeled Bush's attack a McCarthyite
tactic.
   Wright also repeated his belief that attempting to use the
pledge as a political weapon ``is McCarthyism,'' a reference to the
fervently anti-communist senator who impugned many Americans'
patriotism in the 1950s.
   The pledge, Wright said, is like the daily prayer that opens
House sessions. ``It's a personal matter'' and members are ``free
not to do so'' if they choose. ``I don't think it's up to me to go
around and see whose lips are moving,'' he said.
   Republicans appeared to delight last week when Rowland surprised
the chamber's Democratic leadership and sought a sudden rules
change to make the pledge permanent. The move was defeated on a
226-168 vote, largely along party lines.
   Without mentioning Rowland, Wright today said ``the idea of
trying to use the pledge as a wedge of division among Americans is
what I regard as McCarthyism.''
   He added: ``To suggest that another political party is less
patriotic ... is childish, immature and mean-spirited as a person
can be.''
   Rowland rose after the pledge was recited today to add that he
agreed with Wright that it should ``not be confrontational.''
   Congress formally endorsed the pledge in a 1942 law, and the
words ``under God'' were added in 1954 by a second law. But the
31-word sentence has not been a part of the chamber's own routine.

<HEAD>Quayle Ridicules Dukakis on Defense, Jokes About `Rubber Duck'
Advisers</HEAD>

   Dan Quayle ridiculed Michael Dukakis'
national security credentials Tuesday with jokes about the
Democratic nominee's ``rubber duck'' naval adviser and foreign
policy dealings limited to his New Hampshire neighbors.
   At a rally of several hundred supporters in Bismarck, the
Republican vice presidential candidate said Dukakis was
``dangerously naive'' on national security and ``the most
anti-defense candidate on a national level since George McGovern.''
   Earlier, Quayle told backers in the Milwaukee suburb of
Wauwatosa it was ``shocking'' that Dukakis found it necessary to
receive defense briefings last weekend from members of Congress.
   ``He doesn't know enough about national defense,'' said the
Indiana senator. ``He has to stop in and ask members of Congress
that I've been working with for the past 12 years.''
   On a day when Dukakis delivered a major speech on U.S.-Soviet
relations in Chicago, Quayle said the Massachusetts governor
doesn't have ``the understanding or qualifications'' to run for
president.
   ``Want to hear a sad story about the Dukakis campaign?'' Quayle
asked.
   ``The governor of Massachusetts, he lost his top naval adviser
last week. His rubber duck drowned in his bathtub,'' Quayle said to
roars of laughter from his audience at Bush-Quayle campaign
headquarters for Wisconsin.
   Dukakis press secretary Dayton Duncan responded in Chicago that
``Quayle's trying to call attention to his age.'' Quayle is 41.
   Republican nominee George Bush's running mate then headed for
Colorado on a Western campaign swing that focused on jobs, economic
prosperity and a strong defense.
   The Republicans have tried to portray Dukakis as weak on defense
and foreign policy issues, and have criticized his opposition to
the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles and President Reagan's Star
Wars plan for a space-based missile defense.
   ``You don't learn what you need to know about the national
security of our nation in one weekend cram course,'' said Quayle,
referring to Dukakis' weekend meetings with Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
and Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairmen of the Senate and House Armed
Services committees.
   ``The closest thing he (Dukakis) has to foreign policy
experience is dealing with the governor of New Hampshire,'' Quayle
said.
   He accused Dukakis of having a ``midnight conversion'' on
defense, presumably a reference to a recent, apparent softening in
the governor's opposition to Star Wars.
   ``He didn't just find religion. He found his poll numbers,''
Quayle said.
   He noted that Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser to
former President Carter, had endorsed Bush, who named Brzezinski on
Monday to a 13-member panel of campaign advisers on national
security.
   ``Dr. Brzezinski ... is willing to put his reputation, his
integrity ... to support George Bush,'' Quayle said. ``The reason
he made that decision is because he knows the governor of
Massachusetts. He knows what kind of a president he would be.''

   Voters chose candidates Tuesday to succeed retiring Sens. Robert
Stafford and William Proxmire, with moderate Republican Rep. James
Jeffords facing a conservative in Vermont and former Democratic
Gov. Anthony S. Earl battling a sports team owner in Wisconsin.
   In other highlights of primary voting in six states, New
Hampshire Rep. Judd Gregg was favored over two opponents for the
GOP nomination to succeed retiring Gov. John Sununu.
   And in Arizona, more than a dozen Republican legislators who
voted to impeach or convict Evan Mecham last spring were challenged
by candidates loyal to the ousted governor.
   Jeffords, whose frequent opposition to President Reagan's
policies angered fellow Republicans, faced newcomer Michael Griffes
in the Senate primary. Democrat William Gray, a former U.S.
attorney, had no primary opposition.
   Proxmire's retirement in Wisconsin after 31 years in the Senate
sparked spirited races in both parties. On the Democratic side, the
latest newspaper polls showed Earl and Milwaukee Bucks basketball
team owner Herbert Kohl leading a four-way race that included
former Deputy Attorney General Edward R. Garvey and Secretary of
State Douglas La Follette.
   Kohl, who had never before sought public office, spent nearly
$2.1 million, much of it on TV ads, and drew criticism from his
rivals that he was trying to buy the election.
   Republicans chose between state Sen. Susan Engeleiter, a
moderate, and the more conservative Stephen B. King, former GOP
state chairman.
   In New Hampshire, Gregg, son of a former governor, faced former
Manchester Mayor Robert Shaw and political neophyte William
Lawrence for the Republican nomination for governor. The unopposed
Democratic nominee was lawyer Paul McEachern, a foe of the Seabrook
nuclear power plant who narrowly lost to Sununu in 1986.
   In Gregg's 2nd District, Chuck Douglas, a former state Supreme
Court justice, was locked in a bitter contest with former state
Rep. Betty Tamposi in a six-way GOP race.
   Primaries also were held in:
   _ Minnesota, where Sen. David Durenberger and Democratic
Attorney General Hubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey III were expected to
breeze past primary challengers for Senate nominations;
   _ Utah, where Democrats Craig Oliver and Robert Stringham sought
the nomination to oppose Republican Rep. Howard Nielson.

   Stafford, a Republican, and Proxmire, a Democrat, were among six
senators _ three from each party _ to retire this year. Democrats
now control the Senate by a margin of 54 to 46.
   There was irony in the high-stakes campaign to succeed the
72-year-old Proxmire, who had become famous for his low-budget
campaigns and congressional budget-cutting efforts. In winning
re-election 1982, Proxmire said he spent $145.10, some of it for
postage to return contributions.
   Kohl, a former chain store owner, was by far the leader in
spending, followed by $431,000 by Earl, $360,000 by Garvey and
$15,500 by La Follette, as of Aug. 24, Election Board records
showed.
   In the GOP race, King, 47, a former FBI agent and one-time
chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, sought to pin a
liberal tag on Engeleiter, 36, a veteran of 11 years the
Legislature and the Senate's minority leader.
   King stressed his opposition to a tax increase and abortion and
his support for the death penalty. Engleiter, who said she had the
backing of a broader segment of the party, said she had spent much
of her legislative career fighting against increased taxes.
   King criticized Engeleiter for running for the Senate when she
has two small children at home.
   Motherhood also became an issue in New Hampshire, where Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, who endorsed Douglas for Congress, created an
uproar last week when he said Tamposi shouldn't run because she has
a 22-month-old daughter. Humphrey apologized two days later.
   Douglas won endorsements from nationally known conservatives,
including Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York.
   In Vermont, Griffes called himself the real Republican in the
race to succeed the 75-year-old Stafford, who served as governor
and congressman before entering the Senate in 1971.
   Jeffords' support of Democratic initiatives over the years
angered many of the GOP faithful, including former four-term Gov.
Richard Snelling, who donated $1,000 to the Griffes campaign.
   In 1981, Jeffords was the sole House Republican to vote against
Reagan's tax-cut package; In 1987, he had the second-highest
anti-Reagan voting record among Republicans in the House, as
analyzed by Congressional Quarterly magazine. He opposed the
president on 71 percent of the key votes.

<HEAD>Cuba Blames Defector For London Shooting Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Havana Radio on Tuesday blamed a shadowy defector
and British intelligence for an incident in which a Cuban diplomat
in London pulled out a gun and fired shots at people he said were
menacing him.
   Britain ordered Cuba's ambassador, Oscar Fernandez-Mell, and the
Cuban embassy's third secretary, Carlos Manuel Medina Perez, to
leave the country Monday in the wake of the shooting.
   A statement by the the British Foreign Office expelling the two
Cubans said the government ``would not tolerate the use of firearms
by diplomats.''
   The Foreign Office said Medina Perez told police he fired
because he was afraid for his safety. It said he was released from
police custody after he claimed diplomatic immunity.
   Government-operated Havana Radio blamed Cuban defector
Florentino Aspillaga Lombard for the shooting, saying he tried to
strong-arm Medina Perez into defecting.
   In a broadcast monitored in Miami, the radio station said
Aspillaga defected from the Cuban embassy in Prague,
Czechoslovakia, in June 1987 ``to put himself at the service of the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.''
   Aspillaga, along with three men and a woman, approached Medina
Perez and tried to persuade him to defect, the government radio
said.
   ``The traitor (Aspillaga) threatened Medina Perez to make him
desert,'' said Havana Radio. ``In response, Carlos Medina Perez
drew the gun he was carrying and fired against the traitor, and the
whole group ran away.''
   The Cuban radio said ``it is absolutely impossible that a man
totally in the hands of the CIA and under strict security measures
could travel to Great Britain and carry on this type of action
against a Cuban diplomat without the cooperation of the British
Intelligence Service and British authorities.''
   The radio called Perez's expulsion ``deeply unfair and
arbitary,'' saying it was aimed at hiding cooperation between
British intelligence and the CIA in the affair.
   Police said detectives had traced one man who was slightly
injured in the shooting and were satisfied he ``was not posing a
threat to anyone.'' Scotland Yard police headquarters said it would
not release the man's identity, adding the police inquiry into the
shooting was closed.

   Comedian Pat Paulsen and his wife of less
than two months were going to celebrate their marriage with a
reception. Instead, he sued for a divorce.
   The suit was filed Friday, the same day the couple had scheduled
their reception.
   Paulsen's suit contends that Linda D. Chaney, 35, altered her
written contract with him, refused to give him an accounting of
finances and bookings, and diverted at least $200,000 from the Pat
Paulsen Enterprises to her private accounts.
   Paulsen, now staging his third tongue-in-check campaign for the
U.S. presidency, wed Chaney secretly July 20 in Atlanta, where they
were attending the Democratic National Convention.
   A call to Chaney's home Tuesday was answered by a woman who said
Chaney was not available.

   For Mel Torme, the arrival of rock 'n' roll in
the 1950s signaled it might be time to leave show biz.
   ``I found myself playing out-of-the-way joints where I drew as
little as 15 people a night,'' the pop-jazz singer said. ``I
decided, OK, if there's no place for me in show business anymore,
I'll become an airline pilot and continue my writing.''
   The crooner dubbed ``the Velvet Fog'' didn't heed that call.
Still, Torme, who turned 63 on Tuesday, did fly planes and write
books. His third book is an autobiography, ``It Wasn't All
Velvet,'' which is due in bookstores in two weeks.

   Actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg on Tuesday
began a three-day fast to draw attention to a national boycott of
California table grapes grown with pesticides.
   ``I sent (United Farm Workers President) Cesar Chavez a telegram
while he was fasting, that I would do anything I can to help,'' Ms.
Goldberg said.
   The actress, who has been in Baltimore this summer working on
films, was joined in the fast by Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a
lawyer and daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
   ``Men, women and children who pick grapes suffer the highest
cancer rate, miscarriages and birth defects. They suffer because of
pesticides,'' Mrs. Townsend said.
   Chavez ended his 36-day fast in August. Others have continued
the protest with three-day fasts.

   Playwright Neil Simon has never been one to
draw attention to himself.
   Entertainer Sid Caesar says Simon is one of the most soft-spoken
guys in show business.
   ``He was always so quiet,'' Caesar said. ``When he had something
to say, he'd whisper it to Carl Reiner because Carl was a `shirer'
_ a yeller. Then Carl would jump up and start to speak and I'd
start yelling, `What is it Neil's got to say?'''
   Responded Simon: ``You don't have to be noisy to be a writer.''
   The exchange came during a recent fund-raising dinner honoring
Simon, during which he was presented with the Lifetime Achievement
Award by the Los Angeles Music Center.
   The event raised more than $200,000 for the Center Theater
Group-Ahmanson Theater and the Music Center, where 69 Simon
productions have been featured, including the premieres of
``California Suite,'' ``Chapter Two'' and ``Brighton Beach
Memoirs.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republicans proposed a series of
education, employment and health initiatives Tuesday aimed at
ensuring that Hispanics ``have access to the opportunities and
support systems'' already available to most Americans.
   But the Democratic chairman of the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus, Rep. Albert Bustamante of Texas, said there was ``not
really any substance to that report'' and that its findings were an
``election year-type of rhetoric.''
   ``They need a primer on understanding the issues because they
always vote wrong on the issues. I'm happy to see they've at least
put a position out there,'' he said, calling the 1980s ``really and
truly a disaster for Hispanics.''
   But another Hispanic leader, Rita Di Martino of Staten Island,
N.Y., board chairman of the the National Council of La Raza and New
York state Republican Party vice chairman, said the report dealt
meaningfully with the issues affecting Hispanics, the nation's
fastest-growing population group.
   ``We have some very important people on this (task force). This
is a first. This is historic,'' said Ms. Di Martino, a member of
the task force's bipartisan advisory committee.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the panel, said many of
the recommendations could be accomplished with legislation, while
the executive branch would be encouraged to take action with
through executive orders.
   He said the task force had already backed efforts to provide $6
million to fund national and local Hispanic literacy programs.
   Bustamante challenged the Senate Republicans to do more, and
back up their promises with discretionary funds for programs and
minority contracts benefiting Hispanics.
   The report said education is the most critical issue in the
Hispanic community. Unless literacy and dropout rates are turned
around, it said, young Hispanics will not be able to find jobs as
the United States evolves from a manufacturing to a technology and
service-based economy with greater needs for workers with higher
skills.
   Studies show Hispanics are the least educated major population
group in the country, the study said.
   The task force's recommendations include:
   _Expanding national and local initiatives to reduce illiteracy
and combat a high Hispanic student dropout rate.
   _Advocating programs at the federal, state and local levels and
in the private sector that provide managerial skills assistance to
small minority businesses.
   _Pursuing an aggressive trade policy with Mexico to benefit
businesses on both sides of the border.
   _Improving the recruitment of qualified Hispanics into
managerial and professional positions in the private and public
sector.
   _Promoting health and disease prevention efforts, with an
emphasis on fighting AIDS, and increasing the number of health care
professionals serving the Hispanic community and increasing
Hispanic input in health care policy issues.
   _Supporting better access to bonding and insurance for small
businesses.

<TEXT>
   Standing on South Africa's doorstep,
Pope John Paul II called on the people of this desert nation
Tuesday to assist victims of racial discrimination who are
``deprived of their legitimate rights.''
   The pope, on a one-day visit to diamond-rich and bone-dry
Botswana, praised the nation as ``an island of peace in a troubled
sea.''
   Botswana, a landlocked country of 1.1 million people, has never
fought a battle in its 22 years of independence despite bordering
such turbulent places as Angola, Mozambique, South-West Africa and
South Africa.
   ``You are a peace-loving and friendly people who believe in the
basic equality and human dignity of every man and woman,'' the
pontiff told about 2,000 people who greeted him at the airport,
including a choir of bare-breasted, teen-age schoolgirls.
   Later, in a speech at the Cathedral of Christ the King, the
pontiff clearly referred to South Africa and its apartheid policies
of racial segregation, without mentioning the country by name.
   ``You have witnessed the plight of those who are subjected by
law to discrimination,'' the pontiff told the audience in Gaborone,
10 miles from South Africa's northern border. ``I gladly support
your desire to be close to those who are unjustly deprived of their
legitimate rights and lack decent living conditions.''
   The pope arrived Tuesday from Zimbabwe, the first stop on his
five-nation tour of southern Africa.
   He travels Wednesday to Lesotho, a mountain kingdom surrounded
by South Africa, where he is likely to make additional comments on
apartheid. The pontiff is not visiting South Africa on this trip
but the Vatican has said he may do so in the future.
   At an afternoon mass in Botswana's national stadium, John Paul
renewed his call for regional peace to a crowd of 50,000 _ more
than Botswana's entire Catholic population of 45,000. Several
thousand of those attending were from South Africa, according to
church officials.
   ``What are the causes of humanity's fears?'' the pontiff said.
``It is the absence of justice and peace in our lives, and in the
world, that so often troubles us and arouses our fears.''
   ``Nation still lifts sword against nation. There is much
training for war,'' he said.
   South Africa has raided Botswana several times in past years
killing alleged guerrillas of the African National Congress.
   The pope was serenaded by several hundred members of a women's
choir and received gifts from Catholic parishes around the country.
Two parishes from western Botswana brought crosses they had carried
by foot and car across the Kalahari desert, which makes up 80
percent of Botswana.
   Botswana has a Western-style, multiparty democracy, a rarity in
Africa. Diamond mines make it relatively wealthy on the continent
but it remains heavily dependent economically on South Africa.
   On papal matters, the Vatican said Tuesday the pope would return
to Africa next year, with stops in Tanzania and the island nation
of Madagascar.
   There has been speculation that the trip, expected next May,
also may include Angola and South Africa. Vatican spokesman Joaquim
Navarrro, traveling with the pope, said neither country was ``on
the program,'' although he confirmed that Angolan bishops had
recently sent an invitation to the pope.

<TEXT>
   Mario Biaggi's campaigns for Congress have been
pretty dull affairs the last couple of decades; he's won every one
by a landslide. This year, Biaggi hopes for something new. He hopes
to lose.
   At least he says he hopes to lose. Nothing comes at face value
in Bronx politics, a world where tempers run hot, bad blood runs
deep and rap sheets serve as the nearest thing to a score card.
   What is certain is that the race for Biaggi's seat is one of the
oddest in years, even by Bronx standards. A month ago, convicted of
corruption, Biaggi quit his office. Now, he just might win it back.
   ``What we've got there are pretty unique circumstances,'' said
Raymond Smock, historian of the House of Representatives. Without
checking, he said, the last case of an unwilling winner to spring
to mind occurred in 1788.
   Of course, Biaggi has yet to win, and his opponents in the
Democratic primary predict he won't. ``People have a lot of
affection for him,'' said state Assemblyman Eliot Engel. ``But
they're not going to vote for him.''
   Some will. Biaggi's focus on constituent services made him
immensely popular in his district, which takes in much of the north
Bronx and Yonkers. He won each of his last six races with at least
90 percent of the vote.
   Indeed, his career came to an end at the jury box rather than
the ballot box. Twice in the past year he was convicted of federal
corruption charges, and he was facing expulsion from the House when
he tearfully quit last month.
   In addition to resigning his seat, ``I am withdrawing as a
candidate for re-election,'' he said at the time. ``I will not
campaign. I will not run.''
   But neither of his opponents in the primary Thursday is remotely
as well known as Biaggi; even a strong sympathy vote conceivably
could win him the nomination. And because Democrats outnumber
Republicans 3-1 in the district, the Democratic nominee generally
wins the seat. In any case, there is only one candidate on the
Republican line: Mario Biaggi.
   The issue goes beyond Biaggi. The Bronx Democratic organization
has been shaken by recent corruption convictions of party leaders.
If Biaggi won and declined to serve, the organization could
reassert itself by naming its own candidate to run in a special
election, which are held without primaries.
   Borough President Fernando Ferrer, who presents himself as a
reformer, was concerned enough this week to warn voters away from
Biaggi. ``We in the Bronx have worked hard to recover our lost
respect,'' he said. ``Let's not lose an opportunity to better the
Bronx by throwing away a vote.''
   One issue is why Biaggi remained on the ballot at all. He did
not contest his opponents' court challenge of his nominating
petitions, hoping, said his lawyer, to be thrown off the ballot.
   But the state Board of Election already had ruled the petitions
valid, and without evidence otherwise, the court upheld it.
Biaggi's federal prosecutor expressed a dim view of the suggestion
that he move out of state as a ploy to disqualify himself. And with
no other legal reason for the court to remove him from the ballot,
he stayed on.
   A victory by one of the challengers would make the matter moot.
Engel, a state assemblyman since 1977, has won all the key
endorsements. Also running is a former assemblyman, Vincent
Marchiselli, who has sought to link Engel to the discredited party
organization.
   The fight has been hostile, though traditional issues have
hardly figured in it. The race itself is the issue: Marchiselli
charged that Engel sought secretly to keep Biaggi on the ballot so
Biaggi and Marchiselli would split the Italian-American vote.
Engel, meanwhile, charged that politicians who want the seat were
conducting a ``whispering campaign'' to win votes for Biaggi so the
party would designate them to run in a special election.
   Biaggi, who faces sentencing for his latest conviction next
month, is keeping quiet. He declined to be interviewed, and a
spokesman, Bob Blancato, would refer only to the resignation
statement saying he would not campaign.
   ``At the juncture where we are, that stands,'' Blancato said.
``After Thursday, there may be a need for a new statement.''

<HEAD>Appellate Court Hears Arguments Over Fairness Doctrine</HEAD>

   An appellate court heard arguments Tuesday
that the Federal Communications Commission decision to abolish the
fairness doctrine for broadcasters both hurt and advanced the cause
of free speech.
   The requirement that television and radio stations present
opposing viewpoints on controversial questions was a ``prevalent
deterrent to broadcasters to air public issues,'' FCC general
counsel Diane S. Killory told a panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals here.
   ``Elimination of the doctrine would best further the public's
interest in recieving robust debate on controversial issues,'' she
told the three-judge panel, which is reviewing last year's 4-0 FCC
vote abolishing the fairness standard.
   The FCC found that because there were so many sources of
information, the 38-year-old fairness doctrine was no longer needed
to ensure the dissemination of all points of view in the debate on
a public issue, she said.
   Enforcement of the fairness doctrine prompted many broadcasters
to avoid controversial issues so they would not be required to air
all sides to a question and the result was bland speech, she said.
   But Andrew Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Access
Project, accused the FCC of ignoring abundant evidence that many
broadcast outlets had not presented alternate points of view on
controversial subjects.
   ``There was a blatant predisposition to reach this result, the
FCC has flip-flopped,'' he told Circuit Judges Patricia Wald,
Kenneth Starr and Stephen Williams.
   ``Why shouldn't an agency that now says we're concerned about
core First Amendment values get credit for that?'' Starr asked.
   ``It's one thing for the FCC to say it's sensitive to First
Amendment concerns,'' Schwartzman said. But he accused the agency
of conducting a ``one-sided and narrow review.''
   If it found that the regulation had a chilling effect on free
speech, ``the commission is free to tinker with the adminstration
of the fairness doctrine,'' he said. ``It's very convenient outcome
for the FCC to say `there is a very chilling effect, we have to
throw out the whole thing.'''
   But Killory argued that stricter enforcment ``would require the
FCC to get into the editorial judgment of broadcasters.''
   The fairness doctrine requires broadcast stations to present the
opposing viewpoint on a controversial issue in the event that the
other side had purchased advertising to promote its arguments.
   The doctrine's constitutionality was upheld by the Supreme Court
in 1969, but in 1984 the high court said it would review that
decision if presented with new evidence that enforcement was no
longer necessary.
   The next year, the FCC concluded the doctrine no longer served
the public interest but said it would continue its enforcement
because of uncertainty over whetherit was legally binding.
   In 1986, the federal appeals court here found that the fairness
doctrine was not codified as part of the 1959 Communications Act.
   Meredith Corp. then challenged the constitutionality of the
fairness doctrine after the FCC found that a station it owned in
Syracuse, N.Y., had filed to present opposing views about the
construction of a nuclear power plant.
   The appeals court ordered the FCC to consider Meredith's
constitutional challenge, a review that resulted in the Aug. 4,
1987 vote to abolish the doctrine.
   Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment lawyer who represents
Meredith, urged the panel to ``defer to old-fashioned commission
expertise'' which found that ``the public is receiving information
not because of the fairness doctrine but in spite of the fairness
doctrine.''
   Communications attorney Timothy Dyk predicted ``the case will
turn on a constitutional issue. I think this is a case for the
Supreme Court.''
   Organizations supporting the CC included the National
Association of Broadcasters, the Reporters Committee for the
Freedom of the Press and the American Newspaper Publishers
Association.

<HEAD>Cuba Says Envoy Fired At Stalking CIA Man</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cuban Embassy charged Tuesday that its
commercial attache, who was expelled along with the ambassador,
opened fire on a CIA operative who had tried to get him to defect.
   The commercial attache, Third Secretary Carlos Manuel Medina
Perez, and the ambassador, Oscar Fernandez-Mell, left London
Tuesday on a scheduled flight for Prague, en route to the Cuban
capital, Havana.
   In a statement read on the embassy steps, First Secretary
Roberto De Armas charged that the Central Intelligence Agency
operative was a former Cuban diplomat who defected in June _
Florentino Azpillaga Lombard.
   De Armas claimed British and U.S. secret services had worked
together during the incident. The British Foreign Office was
enraged by the shooting because of its strict ban on diplomats
carrying arms.
   ``The traitor in a menacing way instructed Senor Medina Perez to
defect,'' said De Armas. ``In reply to this he took out the gun he
was carrying, fired it and the group ran away.''
   London police said in a statement that anti-terrorist squad
detectives ``traced and interviewed'' a man slighted injured in the
Monday afternoon shooting and ``we are wholly satisfied he was not
posing a threat to anyone.''
   ``We will not be releasing his details,'' the statement from
Scotland Yard police headquarters added. ``Following the action of
the Foreign Office, the inquiry is now closed.'' Officials at
Scotland Yard refused to elaborate.
   The Foreign Office told ambassador Fernandez-Mell he must take
responsibility for Medina Perez being armed, but the ambassador
told reporters at the airport that he found his swift ousting
``very strange.''
   The British domestic new agency, Press Association, said police
sources confirmed that the wounded man ``was a security officer''
and part of a team keeping the diplomat under surveillance.
   Witnesses have said that Medina Perez, who opened fire outside
his apartment in west London, shot at a group of three men and a
woman who fled in a car. He was stopped by police, claimed
diplomatic immunity and then told the Foreign Office he fired
because he was in fear of his life.
   The Foreign Office refused to comment on the reports that the
communist diplomat was under British or U.S. security surveillance.
   ``We have reacted appropriately to a totally unacceptable and
outrageous action on the streets of London,'' said a spokesman, who
according to British civil service practice, declined to be
identified.
   Havana Radio, in a broadcast monitored in Miami, said Aspillaga
defected from the Cuban Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in June
1987 ``to put himself at the service of the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency.''
   The radio called the expulsion of Medina Perez ``deeply unfair
and arbitary,'' saying it had absolutely nothing to do with the
incident.
   Since a policewoman was shot and killed by a gunman firing from
the Libyan embassy at demonstrators in April 1984, the Foreign
Office has taken a harsh attitude towards violations of its blanket
ban on embassies having guns.
   The Cubans were expelled within days of a Vietnamese diplomat
being ordered out for brandishing a gun at demonstrators outside
his embassy.
   In normal circumstances, British policeman are not armed, a fact
which heightens official anger at gun-toting diplomats.
   In his statement, Cuban diplomat De Armas said the alleged CIA
operative could not have entered Britain without collusion between
the U.S. and British authorities. He demanded to know what had
happened to the wounded man and why the British authorities refused
to identify him.
   ``It is possible now that both the British authorities as well
as the British and American secret services will find themselves in
an embarrassing situation when they explain what really happened,''
said De Armas.
   The expulsions mean Cuba has 12 diplomats left in London.
Britain has five diplomats in Havana.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania Officials To Certify Radon Testers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Pennsylvania, where the seriousness of
radon contamination first came to light when a man set off
radiation alarms at a nuclear plant, the state is moving to
regulate companies that test homes for the deadly gas.
   The steps are the outgrowth of nearly four years experience with
radon, an odorless, colorless gas the Environmental Protection
Agency has now linked to 20,000 lung cancer deaths a year
nationwide. The EPA said Monday every home in the country should be
tested for radon because contamination is wider spread than
previously believed.
   Radon is a radioactive gas, trace amounts of which are produced
in the decay of uranium in soil and rocks. The gas is present in
the outdoors normally at about 0.5 percent of the EPA's 4 picocurie
``action level.'' Homes tend to concentrate radon indoors.
   Radon kills people by leaving its radioactive decay products in
the lungs, irradiating the tissues for a lifetime.
   Pennsylvania will require companies testing for the gas to pass
a state-approved course in radon detection, demonstrate at least a
year of professional experience and agree to provide radon-testing
data to the government, said Jason J. Gaertner, a state Department
of Environmental Resources official.
   After Sept. 21, ``it will be illegal to provide radon services
in the state unless they are certified,'' he said Tuesday.
   ``It's simply a health issue which needs to be investigated
house by house,'' Gaertner said. ``The problem levels are
sprodadic, but in being sporadic, they're spread across the entire
country. There aren't really bad areas, there are problem homes.''
   Gaertner, who works in the DER's Bureau of Radiation Protection,
said his office received ``a tremendous number'' of calls Tuesday
because of the EPA report.
   ``What we are really telling them is the same message we have
been giving the public for a year now,'' Gaertner said. ``That
message, based on DER data from the past, is that problem homes can
occur anywhere in the state, but most people after testing don't
have a problem.''
   In neighboring West Virginia, the state Health Department said
it had received more than 50 calls by mid-day Tuesday from
residents concerned about the effects of radon gas.
   ``What the people are mainly concerned about is how they can get
the radon kits to have their homes tested,'' said Rod Kovack, a
radiological technician for the Health Department. ``We've been
furnishing them with a list of places where they can obtain the
kits and along with that list, we've sent a couple of pamphlets
that the EPA has put out for concerned homeowners.''
   The Pennsylvania department plans to publish guidelines for
contractors and homeowners on specific remediation techniques for
homes with unacceptable radon levels, Gaertner said. A companion
booklet will offer tips on selecting contractors, along with a list
of state-certified contractors, he said.
   ``This will help the public in that the industry will be
regulated,'' he said. ``We haven't seen severe problems, but you
want to make sure problems don't occur, that the firms have proper
training and that they are following the proper methods for
remediation.''
   Of the 429 Pennsylvania homes tested in the national survey
released Monday, 37 percent had more than 4 picocuries of
radioactivity per liter of air, the level used by the EPA as the
trigger for more sophisticated tests that determine if remediation
is needed. The highest level was 114 in Perry County.
   Those readings contrast to levels in the thousands of picocuries
found previously in the uranium-rich Reading Prong geological
formation of eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and New
York, Gaertner said.
   Those earlier findings were accurate but rare, he said.
   ``What it did was present a distorted picture of the radon
situation,'' he said. ``The highest reading we have encountered
outside the Reading Prong is no more than 800. And now, we do a
statistically random study and the highest reading is 114.''
   On Dec. 14, 1984, Stanley Watras, a field engineer for a
subcontractor building Philadelphia Electric Co.'s Limerick nuclear
plant, tripped radiation alarms as he went to work.
   Investigators discovered his home atop the Reading Prong had
radon levels 675 times the acceptable state guidelines. He and his
family were evacuated.
   The discovery awoke scientists and officials to the severity of
radon contamination in some areas and led to the creation of the
radiation bureau in Gilbertsville, about a two miles from Watras'
home.

   Consumers planning to test their homes for
radon in the wake of the report by the federal Environmental
Protection Agency can get some free help through state agencies and
the EPA.
   Stephen Page of the EPA's Radon Program said homeowners or
renters should get a copy of the ``Citizen's Guide to Radon''
available through state agencies or an area EPA office. The guide
outlines steps consumers should take when using one of the several
commercially available home testing kits.
   Before purchasing a home kit, Page said, people should check
with a list of 216 companies that have passed the EPA's proficiency
test. Also, it is important to carefully follow kit instructions
because even a slight deviation can easily alter the results, he
said.
   If the reading is 4 picocuries or higher, Page suggests a
follow-up test.
   Bill Belanger, the EPA's regional radiation representative for
Pennsylvania, said homeowners also can buy, for $400, a continuous
radon monitor that uses electronic detectors to count the
disintegration of radon particles.
   Once the level is known, several steps can be taken to alleviate
the problem.
   One method, called sub-slab ventilation, is used in homes with
the highest levels and costs $800 to $1,500. It involves poking a
hole in the basement floor and inserting a polyvinylchloride pipe
that leads to the attic or the outside where a fan carries away the
gas. This can reduce the radon level by as much as 99 percent, Page
said.
   Two other relatively easy methods are sealing the sump pump or
ventilating crawl spaces.
   A third method, caulking any cracks in the basement floor,
should almost always be used in conjunction with another method, he
added.
   Jason J. Gaertner, a A Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources official in Gilbertsville, the state's central office for
radon issues, said Pennsylvania is one of two states with a radon
certification program for companies providing radon services _
kits, staff visits, remediation and supplies. Companies are now
applying for certification, and by the winter, the DER should have
published a list of certified firms.

<HEAD>Senate Drops Effort to Fund Abortions for Rape, Incest Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate surrendered to political reality
Tuesday and gave up its fight to permit federally funded abortions
for poor victims of rape and incest.
   Facing strong House opposition, a White House veto threat and
the prospect of a $140 billion social spending bill held hostage to
the abortion controversy, the chamber agreed by voice vote to scrap
its position.
   The vote came after two roll calls in which members first
refused, 46-44, and then agreed, 47-43, to kill a motion to insist
on allowing federal Medicaid payments for abortions in promptly
reported rape and incest cases.
   Abortion was the only area of disagreement between the two
chambers in the huge spending bill for the departments of Labor,
Health and Human Services and Education.
   The House rejected the Senate view last Friday, voting 216-166
to continue the current policy of federal funds only when an
abortion is needed to save a woman's life.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the subcommittee that
handled the spending bill, pleaded with his colleagues to accept
defeat and help enact the overall measure.
   ``We're talking about a House that we're 50 votes short in.
We're talking about a president that's going to veto the bill.
We're talking about a clock that's ticking,'' Chiles said. ``You
can stand on principle forever and you'll have nothing, if you
don't know when you have to close that gap.'''
   The Senate voted 73-19 in July to expand Medicaid to pay for
abortions in rape or incest cases that are promptly reported.
States would have had the option of retaining the current, more
limited policy.
   The abortion provision was part of the $140 billion
Labor-HHS-Education measure for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
The bill contains money for medical research, job training, college
loans and programs for disadvantaged children, among many other
items.
   In a Sept. 7 letter to congressional leaders, President Reagan
reiterated his intention to veto the entire package if it came to
him with the Senate's abortion provision.
   ``The Senate language would permit the use of federal funds for
the salughter of unborn children, depriving the innocent of the
most basic of civil rights _ the right to life,'' Reagan wrote. ``I
urge the Congress to vote to protect the lives of America's unborn
children.''
   The rhetoric on the Senate floor Tuesday was equally intense.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., a social worker, said she vividly
recalls the coat-hanger abortions suffered by poor women without
access to the high-priced society doctors willing to perform
underground abortions.
   ``Abortion is a legal medical procedure that is now available to
women who are well-off. Denying it to poor women is discrimination,
pure and simple,'' she said. Mikulski also said that making a woman
bear the child of her attacker is ``grotesque and inhumane.''
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., argued that a child conceived by
rape is not ``any less of a human being than one who is not ... One
atrocity ... doesn't justify another. Rape doesn't justify murder.''
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., who launched the crusade for wider
federal abortion coverage, excoriated the administration for
pressing Congress to the wall on the issue.
   ``They're going to use their last gasp and their last piece of
political capital'' to deny abortions to rape and incest victims,
Weicker charged. ``What a legacy for an outgoing president.''
   Weicker, who is up for re-election this year, acknowledged in
advance that he was beaten on the floor vote. But he added, ``I
think it's important that the record be established ... so people
understand how they can respond on Election Day.''
   The National Right-to-Life Committee termed the Senate and House
votes ``a sharp setback for the pro-abortion movement groups'' and
said the administration's support had been ``extremely helpful.''
   Fourteen states and the District of Columbia pay for Medicaid
abortions but only receive federal reimbursement in
life-threatening cases. The Senate vote in July was the first time
since 1981 that either chamber of Congress had approved more
liberal eligibility.

<HEAD>Who's Who Survey Finds Teen-Age Suicide Persists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half the nation's high-achieving
teen-agers knew someone who committed suicide or tried to, and 30
percent said they've considered killing themselves, according to a
survey released Tuesday.
   A separate survey of adults found that a third of them knew a
teen-ager who committed suicide or tried to.
   ``You don't have to be a psychologist to realize all of the
things that are crashing in on these kids today,'' said Paul
Krouse, publisher of the directory, ``Who's Who Among American High
School Students,'' which conducted the survey of teen-agers.
   The survey polled 2,024 teen-agers listed in the directory and
found that 45 percent said they knew a teen-ager who had attempted
suicide or succeeded. Four percent said they had tried it.
   Krouse said Tuesday he believed the findings would be much
higher in a survey of the general teen-age population.
   High achievers likely ``are less vulnerable than a general teen
audience because they have much more success and they seem to be
coming from more stable, family backgrounds where there is more
parental involvement,'' he said.
   A separate national survey of 1,000 adults, questioned by the
National Association of Private Psychiatric Hospitals, found that
27 percent said they knew a teen-ager who had tried to commit
suicide and 17 percent knew a teen-ager who had succeeded.
   Charles Riter of Riter Research, the Annapolis, Md., company
that conducted the survey, said there was some overlap between the
two groups and that 32 percent knew a teen-ager in one of the two
categories.
   The other survey, ``Teen-Agers at Risk: an Adult Perspective,''
found that 72.4 percent of those interviewed believe teen-agers
today face more serious problems than they did at the same age.
   In the Who's Who survey, the percentage of those polled who knew
someone who had tried or committed suicide was down from 48 percent
in 1987, but the poll's margin of error was 2 percentage points,
Krouse said.
   The survey also showed ``the problem may be especially serious
among black high achievers,'' the company said.
   It found that 10 percent of the black high-achievers polled this
year said they had attempted suicide. Five percent of those
surveyed were black.
   Asked what factors contributed most to teen-age suicide, 86
percent of the high achievers said a feeling of worthlessness; 84
percent said a feeling of isolation and loneliness; 72 percent said
pressure to achieve; and 65 percent said a fear of failure.
   Most of those surveyed said they felt suicide prevention
hotlines, awareness programs for teen-agers and their parents and
private counseling in school would help combat the problem.
   Students with grade point averages of A or B can be nominated
for listing in the Who's Who high school directory. The most recent
directory listed about 575,000 students, said spokesman Michael
Sadowski.
   The Who's Who survey also found that:
   _Drug use continues to decline among the nation's brightest high
school students, with less than 1 percent reporting they smoke
marijuana more than once a month. That's down from 4 percent five
years ago and 11 percent a decade ago.
   _Alcohol use also is decreasing, with 63 percent saying they
never drink alcohol, compared with 50 percent in 1978 and 48
percent in 1983.
   _About 75 percent said they had never had sexual intercourse.
   _Forty-eight percent believe schools should dispense condoms to
curb the spread of AIDS, and 49 percent believe schools should
provide other contraceptives to reduce the number of pregnancies.
   _Twenty-eight percent said they don't approve of abortion under
any circumstances, while 22 percent said they approved of abortion
at a woman's discretion.
   _Thirty-two percent said they support Republican George Bush for
president, 23 percent favored Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis,
10 percent liked former Democratic candidate Jesse Jackson and 30
percent were undecided.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first Marines sent to
help battle forest fires that have charred nearly 1 million acres
of Yellowstone National Park arrived Tuesday as the wet weather
that has helped quiet flames began to lift.
   The Marines will help bolster sagging firefighter numbers in the
park and provide relief for fire crews that have been on fire lines
for some time, said Bob Valen of the National Park Service.
   ``We knew we were losing our crews,'' he said. ``Some of them
have been out there way past the usual 21-day assignement. Some
need to get back to college. So we're rotating a lot of crews out.''
   About 550 Marines flew into West Yellowstone, Mont., from Camp
Pendleton, Calif., to help the estimated 7,200 firefighters still
in the park battling fires that have plagued northwestern Wyoming
since early July.
   However, Marines will have received only two days of training
before they are placed on fire lines and will have to be
accompanied by seasoned firefighters, Valen said, putting
additional pressure on fire personnel.
   In all, 1,200 Marines are being sent, with 1,400 Army soldiers
due from Fort Lewis, Wash., to double the number of military
personnel assigned to the fires.
   By Tuesday, the fires had blackened 939,270 acres of the 2.2
million-acre park. Fires in the national forests and parks
surrounding Yellowstone in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho bring the
total burned acreage to 1.4 million acres.
   Fires also burned Tuesday in northern California, where 8,000
people were evacuated from communities in an area northeast of
Sacramento; Oregon, Washington and Utah, which had its last big
fire almost under control at 8500 acres. Washington state's biggest
fire, in Colville National Forest, was declared contained at 20,126
acres.
   Controversy has surrounded the Yellowstone fires because of the
Park Service's ``let burn'' policy, of not fighting most fires that
start naturally. In past years such fires have remained small, but
critics blame the policy for letting fires get out of control in
this unusually dry summer.
   President Reagan said Tuesday he had not been aware of the
policy, but said Interior Secretary Donald Hodel told him ``we were
withdrawing this policy.''
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer said Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis would join him, Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan, Montana
Gov. Ted Schwinden and Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus on Thursday to
survey fire damage in Yellowstone and discuss policy.
   Romer said Dukakis was changing his campaign schedule for the
meeting. Dukakis' campaign headquarters in Boston had no immediate
comment about any Yellowstone appearance, said a media assistant,
Tripp Jones.
   Rain that had fallen on parts of Yellowstone since Saturday
tapered off Tuesday, but had continued longer than expected. The
forecast called for partial clearing by Wednesday and for
temperatures to rise to the low 70s by Thursday.
   But the weather remained cool enough Tuesday that officials
began distributing cold-weather gear donated by residents of
communities around Wyoming to firefighters.
   Few firefighters had been prepared for the cold, wet weather
that limited fire activity and the Salvation Army and other
organizations started collecting coats and other clothing to send
to fire camps.
   Firefighters continued to take advantage of the cool weather to
strengthen fire lines in anticipation of the warmer, drier weather.
   ``The fires are still a threat, we are not out of it yet,'' said
fire information officer Sonya Capek. ``We know there is some more
fire time left in the season, but hopefully it won't be as
intense.''
   Along the north side of the park in Montana, school resumed
Tuesday in Gardiner, the park's northern entrance, after being
closed Monday, but an evacuation plan was ready in case fires
advanced, said Janet McBride of the Gallatin National Forest.
   Near Cooke City and Silver Gate just outside the park's
northeast tip, rehabilitation work has already begun along fire
lines flanking the 81,400-acre Storm Creek fire, which threatened
the towns for several days last week.
   Information officer Ted Coffman said crews were smoothing dirt
over bulldozed lines, repairing creek drainages and planting some
fire lines.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev got an earful of complaints
about housing and food problems in Siberia for the second day in a
row Tuesday, and then tore into local officials for mismanagement.
   ``I felt that it's already impossible to talk to the people,''
the Soviet leader said in a meeting with local officials in the
city of Krasnoyarsk.
   ``Wherever I was, on the street in a factory, or here, the
people are simply at your throat. And I think they're right.''
   His comments were included in an hourlong report about his visit
on the Soviet television evening news program ``Vremya.'' The visit
has received heavy TV coverage, emphasizing the importance of his
message.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said KGB chief Viktor
Chebrikov, also a member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo,
discussed housing and other problems of everyday life on Tuesday
with workers in the Far East port of Vladivostok.
   The public appearances by both men seemed to be part of a
Kremlin effort to show concern about poor living conditions.
   Gorbachev has made the issue of improving the daily lives of
average Soviets a key element of his policy of perestroika, or
restructuring of Soviet society. He has said he is not satisfied
with the efforts made so far.
   The Politburo has called for building enough new housing to give
every family its own apartment by the year 2000.
   Local officials tried to explain their approaches to solving the
region's problems, but were clearly embarrassed by Gorbachev's
criticism.
   One Krasnoyarsk official told Gorbachev that Krasnoyarsk
residents receive the government's recommended yearly allotment of
154 pounds of meat, but the Soviet leader retorted that people
laugh at such standards.
   He said Chinese and Japanese eat much less meat, ``but everyone
who goes there says everything is on the shelf to buy. That's the
story. People are laughing at these scientifically based norms.''
   Soviet citizens shown on televised reports of Gorbachev's
frequent visits around the country usually praise his policies, or
ask uncritical questions.
   But Gorbachev ran into loud complaints about life in Krasnoyarsk
upon flying to the Siberian city, about 2,000 miles east of Moscow,
following a six-week vacation.
   He said the slow rate of development in the huge Krasnoyarsk
region was a constant topic of concern in Moscow. The region
encompasses one-tenth of the entire Soviet Union, produces half of
its coal and 20 percent of its forest products.
   Gorbachev said the government has invested billions of rubles in
the area and is getting little in return.
   He told workers at the Khimvolokno synthetic fiber factory in
Krasnoyarsk that the Politburo was giving special attention to a
shortage of kindergartens.
   Tass quoted one worker as shooting back: ``We have
kindergartens! We don't have housing, and the medical facilities
are bad.''
   Gorbachev heard similar complaints Monday when he stopped in
Yemelyanovo village on his way to Kransoyarsk from the airport
after arriving from Moscow.
   ``We have no hot water! You do what you can to wash!,'' one man
shouted at the 57-year-old Communist Party chief.
   ``I'll tell you right off, comrades, that we cannot count on
successful perestroika if the people ... (have) got so many
problems piling up to form a single big problem, that of inadequate
social amenities,'' Gorbachev said.
   He spoke frequently about environmental problems, criticizing
``gigantomania'' _ the propensity to build huge factories and power
stations regardless of their impact on the environment.
   Too often projects ``carried out under the flag of Communism
threaten nature, and the interests of the people are considered
last,'' he said.
   Tass said that on Chebrikov's visit to Vladivostok, workers at
the Dalvostok ship repair yard complained about work and living
conditions, medical care, shortages of consumer goods and cultural
amenities.

   There she is, No. 1 in the weekly Nielsen
ratings, Miss America on NBC.
   NBC estimates that between 50 and 55 million viewers watched all
or part of ``The Miss American Pageant'' on Saturday night. It was
the highest-ranked pageant since 1982's was No. 1.
   This year's pageant rated 22.3 with a 44 share, an improvement
over last year's, which had a rating of 20.4 and a 42 share,
according to the A.C. Nielsen Co. The highest-rated pageant was in
1986 when it got a 23.0 rating and a 44 share.
   Each rating point represents 886,000 homes with televisions. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   The other two networks ran college football games against the
pageant that ended up ranked 59th and 60th, respectively.
   The two NBC shows that preceded Miss America on Saturday ranked
second and third in the weekly ratings. One of them was especially
good news for NBC, the preview of a new show, ``Baby Boom,'' based
on the movie by the same name and starring Kate Jackson as an
executive who inherits a baby. It ranked third. It had preceded
Miss America and followed ``Golden Girls,'' which was No. 2 in the
ratings. NBC said the ``Baby Boom'' rating was the highest this
season for the network in that time period.
   The rest of the top 10 were: ``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``Monday
Night Football _ Washington vs. New York Giants'' ABC, the Bob Hope
Special on NBC, ``Full House'' on ABC in its Tuesday time period,
``Who's the Boss?'' ABC, ``Cheers'' NBC and ``227'' NBC.
   For the week ending Sept. 11, NBC won with a 12.6. ABC was
second with 11.2. CBS was third with 9.3. It's the 51st week since
the season began last September, and NBC has a season-to-date
rating of 14.5 to CBS' 12.2 and ABC's 12.1. NBC has placed first in
45 out of 51 weeks.
   The lowest-rated prime-time shows were: ``Blacke's Magic,''
``ABC Saturday Morning Preview,'' ``Funny People,'' ``Michigan Vs.
Notre Dame,'' ``Nebraska Vs. UCLA,'' ``Highwayman Special,'' ``48
Hours: Smoking War,'' ``First Impressions,'' ``Frank's Place'' and
``Tickets Please.''
   The evening news race was even tighter than usual, perhaps
partially due to the New York CBS affiliate moving the ``CBS
Evening News'' to 6:30, putting it against ABC's ``World News
Tonight.'' ``NBC Nightly News'' is on its own in New York at 7. New
York represents about 7 percent of the total television audience.
   But a lot of stations pre-empted network news last week for the
Jerry Lewis telethon, and that skewed the numbers. ABC News said it
had an ever lower station clearance because of ``Monday Night
Football,'' 96 percent to 97 percent for NBC and 98 percent for CBS.
   CBS and ABC's ``World News Tonight'' tied with a rating of 9.5.
``NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.4. Each of the three got a 20 share.
   Fox Broadcasting recorded the highest rating yet for its
prime-time series when ``America's Most Wanted,'' with got a 9.0
and ranked 43rd among all network shows. Two other Fox shows,
``Married ... with Children'' and ``21 Jump Street'' also landed
high enough in the ratings to out-rank several network programs.

<HEAD>Federal Commission Says Teacher Test Biased</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission has ruled that a literacy test all Texas teachers were
required to pass to keep their jobs discriminated against teachers
who were black or over 40.
   State officials said they do not agree with the ruling and plan
to negotiate with the EEOC in an attempt to modify or reverse the
decision.
   A summary of the EEOC ruling was released by the Texas State
Teachers Association.
   ``We said all along that the test was discriminatory toward
blacks and older teachers,'' said Ollie Besteiro, vice president of
the Texas State Teachers Association.
   ``This means that school districts will have to go back and
review their records to see which former teachers might be eligible
for reinstatement, back pay or pension adjustments,'' Besteiro said.
   In the spring of 1986, teachers and school administrators had
two chances to pass the Texas Examination of Current Administrators
and Teachers, or TECAT.
   Out of the estimated 200,000 teachers and administrators in the
state, 1,875 failed the test and were not qualified to work in
Texas schools that fall.
   ``Failure rates for blacks and older persons indicated that the
TECAT adversely impacts on blacks and persons within the protected
age group under (federal law) who were either applicants or
employees for teaching positions in the Texas public school system
in 1986,'' the EEOC said.
   State figures showed a passing rate for whites of 99.9 percent,
compared to 98.9 percent for Hispanics and 95.4 percent for blacks.
   State education Commissioner William Kirby challenged the EEOC
decision, said the same statewide results showed that 99.29 percent
of educators under age 40 passed the test, while 99.64 percent of
teachers over 40 passed.
   ``Older educators did better on the test than younger ones. The
results clearly refute the contention that the test discriminated
against individuals on the basis of age,'' he said Tuesday.
   ``The test was a fair and accurate measure of the examinees'
basic reading and writing skills that was in no way influenced by
race or age,'' Kirby said.
   He said another federal agency, the Office of Civil Rights, had
looked at the test and ``found no evidence whatsoever of racial
discrimination.''
   The EEOC ruling was made in response to complaints filed by
several of the failed teachers against their school districts, the
state and the State Board of Education, which approved the content
and passing score of the exam.
   The teachers association represented the teachers before the
EEOC.
   David Thompson, legal counsel for the Texas Education Agency and
the State Board of Education, argued the EEOC erred in its findings
about the literacy test.
   ``We don't think their findings are factually or legally
valid,'' he said. ``I think they got their facts wrong and failed
to consider some legal precedents that affect the case.''
   State attorneys are negotiating with EEOC officials before
taking any action, said Thompson.
   Kirby said EEOC officials had asked for additional information,
including the civil rights report. ``We are confident they will
revise their decision when they review the complete information,''
he said.

<HEAD>Jury Find Seven Officers Guilty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury Tuesday found seven former and
current police officers guilty of 55 counts charging them with
accepting more than 18,000 in bribes from restaurants and bars to
overlook violations and perform special services.
   The jury had deliberated for six days. The seven officers showed
little or no emotion as the verdicts were read.
   Each officer was convicted of two counts under the federal
racketeering statute, or RICO, which carries a maximum sentence of
20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Some defendants also were
found guilty of federal extortion charges, substantive mail fraud
and mail fraud conspiracy.
   In all, the officers were found guilty of 55 counts of a
58-count indictment.
   During closing arguments two weeks ago, Special Prosecutor James
B. Farmer of the New England Organized Crime Strike Force said the
case was ``about misuse of office for personal gain. It's about
each one of them using their power as Boston police officers to
line their own pockets.''
   But defense attorneys argued that the money accepted from
business owners that led to the indictment was just Christmas and
vacation gifts from people with whom the officers worked closely
over several years.
   Defense attorney Anthony Cardinale called the government's
allegations of racketeering a ``gossamer web'' that would collapse
under careful scrutiny.
   Cardinale admitted his client, Detective John F. McCormick,
accepted $400 for himself from a bar manager on two occasions. But
Cardinale said McCormick did not conspire with the other defendants
and was not guilty of racketeering or extortion.
   ``My client, in accepting money, was wrong. But it was not a
felony. This was not an illegal conspiracy,'' he said during the
trial. Cardinale said the officers deserved disciplinary action
from their department, but were not racketeers.
   The seven officers convicted Tuesday were John E. Carey, Thomas
J. Connolly, McCormick, Matthew A. Kilroe, Peter Boylan, Francis X.
Sheehan and Kenneth J. Nave.
   Much of the prosecution's case revolved around tape recordings
made by the manager of the 1270, a downtown nightclub. Joseph
McGowan became an FBI informant.
   Defense attorney's challenged McGowan's credibility, saying he
had lied about being in the Marines and about being blind in one
eye.

<HEAD>EPA Issues Regulations On Underground Tanks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday
issued a 370-page set of regulations that requires almost all
owners of underground tanks, including the corner gasoline station,
to test and protect their tanks, fix leaks and clean up spills.
   One set of requirements applies to all tanks installed after
December of this year. Another set gradually applies to the nearly
2 million existing tanks _ 97 percent of them holding gasoline or
other petroleum products _ and makes them generally meet the new
tank standards in December 1998.
   The first requirement to bite is that existing tanks more than
25 years old must have leak detection systems _ which may be
inventory checks and annual tightness tests _ installed in the
coming year, with the requirement applying to the youngest tanks in
1993. Corrosion protection systems and spill and overfilling
prevention devices would be required only in 1998.
   About 80 percent of the tanks in use are steel tanks without
protection against rust. EPA says its surveys show that anywhere
from 10 percent to 30 percent of the 750,000 tank locations have,
or have had, significant leaks.
   Only about 5 percent of existing tanks have leak detection
systems.
   The regulations, four years in the drafting, require
double-walled tanks or similar double-barrier protection only for
some 60,000 chemical tanks, and one environmental group immediately
criticized the agency for the omission.
   Failure to require double barriers for petroleum product tanks
means ``EPA is leaving the U.S. supply of drinking water vulnerable
to petroleum contamination,'' said staff scientists Lois Epstein of
the Environmental Defense Fund.
   ``The regulations are designed to minimize their impact on the
regulated community, not to protect the environment and the public
from the hzards of petroleum contamination,'' she said.
   But J. Winston Porter, assistant EPA administrator with
jurisdiction over the tank program, said that ``secondary
containment is quite expensive'' and would add unspecified billions
to the cost of the final regulations.
   One of his staff, David O'Brien, said a double-barrier
requirement would add $80,000 to the cost of a new three-tank
service station, and existing stations would have to rip out all
their tanks if the requirement were imposed on existing
installations.
   Such a station might have to spend $3,000 to $8,000 on a leak
detection system and $10,000 to $48,000 on an electrical
rust-prevention system, EPA estimated.
   As it stands, the agency estimated that tank owners will have to
spend the equivalent of $54 billion in today's dollars, but the
owners and society will reap $73 billion worth of benefits in
reduced damage, inventory losses and cleanup costs. It did not
present an estimate of the extra costs and benefits associated with
double barriers, nor did it estimate health benefits from less
contamination of groundwater.
   ``Whether you're mom and pop or Exxon, it doesn't make a lot of
sense to keep a leaking gasoline tank in the ground. The liability
is enormous,'' Porter said.
   About a dozen states already have tank regulations of their own
in place, and part of Tuesday's regulatory package was the
announcement of procedures by which states can win approval of
those programs from EPA.
   A state does not have to have a program at all, which would
leave EPA to enforce the new regulations. Porter said the agency at
this point had made no provision for operating tank programs, and
``we hope very few'' states will opt out.
   Still to come in about six weeks are regulations prescribing
financial responsibilities of tank owners. EPA administers a $500
million fund to help pay for cleanups.
   The regulations exempt septic tanks, tanks of 1,100 gallons or
less storing fuel for farm or non-commercial use, home heating oil
tanks and tanks on basement floors, which are considered
above-ground tanks.
   The regulations take effect 90 days from publication, expected
soon in the Federal Register.

   A judge on Tuesday sentenced a woman and her
three sons to life in solitary confinement at separate prisons so
they ``will understand the pain of separation'' felt by the
families of the three police officers they killed.
   Wayne County Circuit Judge Richard P. Hathaway also said he
wished he could have imposed the death penalty on Alberta Easter
and her sons George, Roy and William Lemons.
   Michigan does not have the death penalty.
   Easter and her sons killed three Inkster police officers during
an 11-hour hostage siege on July 9, 1987.
   Sgt. Ira Parker and officers Clay Hoover and Daniel Dubiel were
killed when they tried to serve a bad check warrant on Easter. All
three were taken hostage in adjoining rooms of the motel in the
Detroit suburb, where Easter and her sons were staying, and were
found dead of multiple gunshot wounds when the four surrendered.
   ``The actions on July 9 are a disgrace to the word family. I
only wish the victims' families could step forward and sentence the
defendants instead of the court,'' Hathaway said.
   In a 10-minute statement to the court, Easter passionately
maintained her innocence.
   ``Our blood is on your hands. You pray for us and our lives,''
she said.
   All three sons expressed remorse for the slayings but maintained
their innocence.

   President Reagan said Tuesday that Vice
President George Bush's child care plan would help provide children
with ``tender, loving family care'' while the Democratic plan
favored by Michael Dukakis would lead to ``licensing grandmothers.''
   Bush, the Republican candidate for president, has proposed a
plan to give tax credits of up to $1,000 to assist families with
child care. The money could be used either to pay for outside child
care or to enable a mother to stay home and take care of her
children instead of working.
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential candidate, has endorsed a
bill by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., providing for the federal
government to reimburse providers of child care. The providers
would have to meet federal standards in order to receive the funds.
   Dodd said recently that Bush's proposed tax credit was ``as
likely to be used for household expenses'' as for care of children
and would fall far short of the $3,000 average annual cost per
family for child care. He also said it would fail to repay the
wages lost by a mother who stays home.
   But Reagan, speaking at a Rose Garden ceremony at which he
signed a proclamation setting the current week aside as National
Hispanic Heritage Week, said Bush's plan ``will allow parents to
choose among a variety of options if they need child care
assistance.''
   ``Experts tell us what common sense always has _ the best people
to take care of children are family members,'' the president said.
``And that's the kind of care that George Bush's plan will help
provide _ tender, loving, family care.
   ``Now, compare this plan with the one offered by the liberals.
They've written a bill that gives assistance not to the parent, but
to the person who provides the care. And why? Because they want to
make sure that they have control over the kind of care your child
receives.
   ``And that means if you want to leave your child with his
grandmother during the day, she will have to be licensed under
federal standards if she's to be given assistance for helping to
raise her grandhild. Licensing grandmothers. Can you believe it?
Well, I think it's terrible, and I don't think the American people
are going to stand for it.''
   Dodd commented, ``No one is worried about the kinds who are left
in their grandmother's care; in a perfect world, every infant and
every young child would have a parent or grandparent who could stay
at home and look after him.
   ``What we are worried about and what the Act for Better Child
Care Services will address is the millions of children whose
parents don't have that option, who work for a living and have to
leave their kids in the hands of strangers _ in day care centers
and family day care homes. That's where we need at least some
minimum health, safety and competency standards.''
   Jason Isaacson, press secretary for the Senate subcommittee on
children and the family, headed by Dodd, said it was true that a
grandmother would have to meet federal standards in order to
receive funds under the bill.
   ``How else can you design a program that receives federal
funds?'' he asked. ``You just can't give federal funds out without
some assurance that they are not going to be used for child neglect
and abuse. We are not worried about grandmothers; we are worried
about 16- and 17-year-olds and people who have no training and no
qualifications.''

<HEAD>Soviets to Buy 350,000 More Metric Tons of Corn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
350,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery during the coming
year, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The sale brought total corn sold to the Soviets in the last two
weeks for the 1988-89 delivery year that started Sept. 1 to more
than 2.95 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 350,000 tons of
corn would be about 13.8 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.73 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $38 million.
   As with the other recent sales, no indication was given whether
the new sales of corn to the Soviets would count under the current
long-term grain supply agreement between the two countries or be
carried forward separately in case a new pact is forthcoming.
   The current five-year pact is set to expire Sept. 30 and
negotiators are trying to work out a new one, or at least an
extension of the current agreement, to take effect on Oct. 1.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   Prior to sales announced since Sept. 1, the Soviet Union had
purchased 9.05 million tons of wheat and 5.17 million tons of corn
for delivery in the fifth year of the agreement, plus 830,000 tons
of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

<HEAD>White House Aide Opposed Change in Product Labels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department proposal to allow up
to 10 percent salvaged meat and tiny bone chips in hot dogs without
telling consumers about it on product labels was made over the
objections of a White House regulatory aide, documents disclosed
Tuesday.
   Jay Plager, administrator of information and regulatory affairs
in the Office of Management and Budget, told USDA in a letter Aug.
19 that the proposed rule change ``does not appear to be consistent
with several of the administration's basic regulatory principles.''
   ``Nor does it appear that the potential benefits to society of
this regulation outweigh the potential cost to society,'' Plager
added.
   Christopher Hicks, the USDA's general counsel, replied that
department officials ``do not agree with the conclusions'' set
forth by Plager.
   ``There are compelling reasons for proposing this rule,
including the fact that it may produce benefits to society that
outweigh societal costs,'' Hicks told Plager in a Sept. 6 letter.
   Copies of the letters by Plager and Hicks were provided to The
Associated Press.
   Advocates of the rule change contend that consumers won't buy
products containing the salvaged material if labels inform them
about it.
   The proposal, which began a 60-day rulemaking procedure Sept. 9,
was announced Monday by the department's Food Safety and Inspection
Service.
   It involves the use of ``mechanically separated'' meat, or MSM,
although current regulations describe it as MS(S) to acknowledge
the species of animal involved. Thus, salvaged meat from a hog
would be mechanically separated pork, or MSP.
   According to the plan, which will be open for public comment
until Nov. 8, processors would be able to use MS(S) to comprise up
to 10 percent of the meat in franks, bologna, luncheon meats,
sausage and similar products without stating so on product labels.
   However, the label would have to indicate the percentage of the
Recommended Daily Allowance of calcium that the product contained.
Calcium is a primary ingredient of bone tissue.
   Regulations limit the salvaged product to no more than 0.75
percent calcium. But bones are about one-fourth calcium, so that
would translate into a maximum of about 3 percent bone.
   The American Meat Institute, a private association that
represents meat packers and processors, said in a statement that
the use of calcium on labels would be ``a more meaningful and
useful term'' to consumers than MS(S), particularly to those who
have a calcium deficiency and to a few who are allergic to calcium
and should be warned away from such products.
   ``There is no wholesomeness or safety issue involved'' in the
MS(S) proposal, the institute said in the brief statement, citing
the department's own description of the product as ``safe and
wholesome as the species from which it is derived.''
   But Plager said the assertion that consumers would avoid
products labeled as containing MS(S) had not been documented in the
proposed rule change.
   ``Furthermore, if one accepts the assertion that some consumers
would be reluctant to purchase a product that they know to contain
MS(S), why should this information be omitted from the label?'' he
said. ``Would its omission, in other words, be inconsistent with
the FSIS (Food Safety and Inspection Service) obligation to prevent
labels that are `false or misleading' and, hence, contrary to FSIS'
statutory mission to protect the public from misbranded items?''
   Plager said that in seeking ways to carry out less burdensome
food safety regulations, ``We must also provide consumers with
more, rather than less, information about food products so that
they may reach informed market decisions.''
   Under current regulations, MS(S) can comprise up to 20 percent
of the meat portion of these products, but the labels must state
that the products contain MS(S).
   The department said that under the proposed rule change _ which
was sought by a group of meat processors and supported by the trade
_ MS(S) ``would not have to be listed in the ingredients statement
on the label as long as it does not exceed 10 percent'' of the meat
portion of the finished product.
   When animals are slaughtered, most of the red meat is cut or
scraped from bones by hand. But a lot of edible tissue clings to
the bones and gristle, particularly in neck bones, ribs, joints and
other hard-to-scrape places.
   The bones and the attached meat remnants are put through a
grinder and forced through fine sieves. Although most of the bones
are strained out, the resulting mixture still contains bits of bone
about the size of ground pepper.
   According to the meat processors who asked USDA for the rule
change, no company at present is commercially producing MS(S) for
consumer products because of ``unwarranted negative connotations''
associated with the term MS(S).
   Under various names, MS(S) has been authorized for use in the
meat products since 1978 and has undergone numerous legal
challenges from consumer groups opposed to the salvaged product
itself or labeling requirements.

   The Pentagon has re-created a tiny slice of
the Soviet military machine to serve as a mobile laboratory for
testing American weapons and equipment.
   The unusual amalgamation of enemy gear is now undergoing its
first operational test at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M., the
Pentagon announced Tuesday.
   Known formally as the Mobile Integrated Threat Test, the setup
replicates ``a key slice of a Soviet Army headquarters and division
organization'' and uses real enemy equipment obtained through a
variety of means, officials said.
   Most of the equipment is electronic _ primarily radar and radio
gear. But MiG jet fighters also will be used in simulating the
``threat force,'' the Pentagon added in a statement.
   The U.S. military has long conducted tests and experiments with
pieces of military equipment made in the Soviet Union, Warsaw Pact
and Third World countries and then captured, stolen or covertly
purchased.
   What makes the new effort different is an attempt to combine the
radar, radios and targeting equipment into the type of
``integrated'' system that U.S. forces would face on a battlefield.
   Also setting the work apart is the creation of a small
organization known as the Defense Test and Evaluation Support
Agency that is responsible for operating the gear and playing the
enemy.
   ``We're not re-inventing the wheel; bits and portions of this
have been done in the past,'' said James Wilson, the director of
the Mobile Integrated Threat Test.
   ``What we're going to offer is the ability to deliver, set up
and operate this (enemy) gear for testing U.S. systems. We're
trying ... to come close to the real thing. The gear we have is not
state-of-the-art, but it's still in use within the Warsaw Pact.''
   The tests now under way at Kirtland are designed to demonstrate
that a relatively large network of Soviet equipment can be operated
just like the Russians would handle it. Once that goal is
accomplished, the support agency will respond to requests from the
military services for assistance in checking out the effectiveness
of various types of American equipment.
   The Kirtland tests, which will run to early October, will
include some flights by Soviet aircraft ``simulating close-air
support missions'' as well as flights by New Mexico Air National
Guard A-7 attack jets.
   The A-7s will be used ``to test the capabilities of the Soviet
sensors,'' the Pentagon statement said.
   ``But this is not a traveling road show,'' Wilson said. ``There
won't be any dogfights or anything like that. We don't want to
oversell what we're doing.''

   In the battle for the White House, one of the
fiercest fights of all is being waged over defense, with George
Bush accusing Michael Dukakis of opposing every military advance
``since the slingshot'' and the Democrat claiming the Republicans
have neglected ``our troops in the field'' to pursue a nuclear
shield in space.
   By opposing the MX and Midgetman missiles and ridiculing the
Strategic Defense Initiative as ``a fantasy,'' Dukakis has laid
himself open to Republican barbs that he would undermine American
strength in arms talks with the Soviets.
   Dukakis, in turn, has demanded that Bush explain how he proposes
to pay for all the weapons in the Pentagon arsenal.
   The Massachusetts governor has launched a counteroffensive in
recent days, visiting an Ohio plant that makes engines for the
Stealth bomber Monday to dramatize his support for that
radar-evading plane.
   On Tuesday, Dukakis donned a helmet and rode in a M-1 Abrams
tank at a General Dynamics facility in Sterling Heights, Mich.,
where he charged the Reagan administration sought to cut tank
production by a quarter.
   ``We'll continue research on strategic defenses, but we're not
going to waste hundreds of billions of dollars on a system our best
scientists say won't work, at a time when we're shortchanging our
troops in the field and mortgaging our future,'' said Dukakis, who
also planned a major address on defense in Washington Wednesday.
   To date, Dukakis has been on the defensive in arguing that what
the American military really needs is a ``conventional defense
initiative'' to beef up its front-line forces in Europe.
   Far from promising actual cuts in Pentagon spending, Dukakis has
suggested any savings on strategic weapons may be offset by the
need to buy more tanks, artillery and conventional weaponry.
   Bush, meanwhile, has had a field day making the rounds of
military plants and bases, pillorying a rival who ``gives me the
impression he's opposed to every new weapons system since the
slingshot'' and quipping that Dukakis ``thinks a naval exercise is
something you find in the Jane Fonda Workout Book.''
   But Bush, who has not suggested scrapping a single Pentagon
weapons program, so far has not spelled out how he proposes to keep
the $289 billion Pentagon budget within the constraints of his
so-called ``flexible freeze'' on all federal spending save Social
Security.
   Regardless of who wins, the next president will inevitably be
faced with hard decisions on Pentagon spending.
   ``It's been a dirty little secret of the Reagan administration
that for the whole second term the defense budget has undergone
real declines,'' said Kenneth Adelman, Reagan's former director of
the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
   After doubling in his first four years, the Pentagon budget has
fallen 10 percent in real dollars since 1985. It is still 53
percent higher than before the Carter-Reagan buildup.
   But it would take a major new spurt in spending to get all of
the major new weapons off the Pentagon's drawing boards and into
the field _ or space.
   Lawrence Korb, a former Reagan assistant secretary of defense,
said: ``Right now in defense you have a $400 billion program and a
$300 billion budget. Whoever gets in there is going to have to get
that program down. ... Something will have to go.''
   The Democrats' platform calls for ``more stable defense
budgets,'' not cuts. Dukakis says his top priority ``will be to
improve our conventional forces ... while negotiating sensible arms
control agreements.''
   But building up that conventional strength will not be cheap.
   Korb, director of the Center for Public Policy Education at the
Brookings Institution, estimates it would cost $5 billion for each
extra day the U.S. wants to be able to fight a conventional war in
Europe against the Soviets.
   Adelman, now vice president of the Institute for Contemporary
Studies, said: ``Dukakis cannot save any money like he talks about
by cutting down the strategic forces and pouring those funds into
conventional forces. There's not going to be that much to pour in.
Strategic forces account for at the most 12 percent of the U.S.
defense budget. Eighty-eight percent is conventional.''
   Military analyst Joshua M. Epstein said it is Bush's figures
that don't add up.
   ``Bush is talking about trying to drive eight lanes of traffic
through a three-lane tunnel as far as the Pentagon budget is
concerned. He has just not realistically faced up to the budget
constraints that will be imposed by Congress,'' said Epstein, a
Brookings senior fellow.
   ``The extra five lanes are continuing funding at high levels for
SDI; following through on plans for a 600-ship Navy; continued
modernization of the strategic triad with not one bomber but two,
the B-1 and the Stealth; the MX and Midgetman missile; a full
Trident submarine program,'' said Epstein.
   ``If you're not prepared to cut some of these glamor programs
then things like readiness and training and personnel and
maintenance and conventional forces are going to take a beating,''
he said.
   Dukakis has said he would continue basic Star Wars research at a
reduced level of $1 billion, less than a third of what is now
spent. He opposes a rail-based MX missile system and the Midgetman.
He favors scrapping plans to build two new supercarrier task forces
that cost $18 billion each.
   The Massachusetts governor supports the radar-evading Stealth
bomber, which he boasted Monday was ``started by a Democratic
president, it was supported by a Democratic Congress and it's going
to be completed by my administration.'' He also favors the D-5
submarine launched ballistic missile.
   He charges that despite spending nearly $2 trillion on defense
and increasing the U.S. nuclear arsenal from 7,000 warheads to
12,000, the Reagan-Bush administration has left U.S. armed forces
short of spare parts and ammunition.
   Bush has committed himself to research, testing and deployment
of SDI as rapidly as possible _ but he cautioned last month that
``a full deployment ... would be very expensive.''
   Bush pledges to support ``rail mobility for the MX missile.'' He
says the single-warhead Midgetman would be ``hard to locate and
could enhance stability. However, it is very expensive.''

<HEAD>Air Force Says Most Spectators To Be Moved Away From Shuttle
Launch</HEAD>

   Spectators and journalists in the traditional
shuttle launch viewing area have one chance in a thousand of being
killed from an out-of-control rocket booster, the Air Force said
Tuesday.
   For that reason, said Col. Larry Gooch, visitors and more than
half the journalists expected for the Discovery liftoff later this
month will be placed at a site 6{ miles away from the launch pad,
instead of the usual 3{ miles.
   The chance of being killed by an exploding booster at the more
remote site is hundred times less _ or, one in 100,000 _ said
Gooch, the commander of the Eastern Space and Missile Center at
Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   The Air force is responsible for safety in the entire area which
is dotted with launch pads.
   More than 3,600 members of the news media already have applied
for credentials and the total is expected to rise to more than
4,000, said NASA public affairs chief William Sheehan.
   He said all news media who need to be at the close-in press site
at the moment of launch will be accommodated, the maximum number
being about 1,800. The journalists who will be moved will be those
who don't have immediate deadlines, such as weekly newsmagazines,
Sheehan said.
   He issued guidelines for credentials: as many as 40 for each of
the major television networks, 10 for each wire service, two each
for daily newspapers, six each for small television networks, four
each for radio networks, three each for individual television
stations and two each for individual radio stations.
   The rest of the credentialed journalists will be put at the
remote site, where there are no telephones and only minimal
services. The general public, which has turned out a million strong
for some past launches on the roads near the Kennedy Space Center,
will not be affected because admittance to the center is restricted.
   The changes were ordered, Gooch said, because the booster
rockets did not tumble end over end when the Challenger exploded,
but instead continued to fly ``in a missile mode.''
   In the case of the Challenger, they went out over the sea. But
if they had returned to land, they would have had to be destroyed
by command of the range safety officer, scattering shrapnel over
the area, Gooch said.
   ``We can never guarantee absolute safety but we can minimize the
risk by minimizing the number of folks,'' said Gooch.
   Jay Greene, a veteran shuttle flight director and chairman of a
NASA risk analysis team said, ``The risk hazard hasn't increased
since (the Challenger accident) ... we understand the risk better.''
   Asked if the Air Force was imposing censorship under the guise
of public safety, Gooch replied: ``I believe we are addressing the
safety issue.''

<HEAD>House Passes Legislation to Require Federal Licenses for Medical
Labs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday approved legislation that
would for the first time require all medical laboratories _
including nearly 100,000 such labs in doctors' offices nationwide _
to be federally licensed.
   Such laboratories perform four billion to six billion tests a
year for diagnosis and monitoring of disease, and some have been
criticized because of rushed procedures that can lead to mistakes.
   Under the bill, passed on a voice vote, all medical labs would
have to meet quality control, personnel and equipment standards and
would be subject to penalties for violations.
   All laboratories would be licensed for two years at a time,
would have to pass proficiency tests and would have to meet
specific, stringent standards for evaluations of Pap smears which
are used to detect cervical cancer.
   There have been charges that private labs that process thousands
of Pap smears daily have been careless in efforts to maximize
profits and on occasion failed to spot cases of cancer.
   Backers of the legislation said there are some 4,500 independent
labs in the United States, 6,600 hospital laboratories and 98,000
labs in doctors' offices. The labs would be required to pay
issuance and renewal fees for their federal certificates.
   The measure now goes to the Senate for further action. The
Reagan administration has not expressed a position on the bill.
   Current law subjects hospital and independent laboratories to
regulation, but does not affect labs in physicians' offices. The
bill would require doctors'-office labs to be certified in order to
receive reimbursement for Medicaid and Medicare cases beginning in
1990.
   Certain relatively simple tests done in doctors' offices, such
as pregnancy tests, diabetes tests and certain urine tests, would
be exempted from the legislation.

   The West German government, citing its
good ties to Iran and Syria, promised Tuesday to seek freedom for
other foreign hostages in Lebanon following the release of a
Frankfurt businessman.
   Rudolf Cordes, who was kidnapped in Beirut 20 months ago, was
released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors late Monday night.
   The kidnappers seized Cordes and another German, Alfred Schmidt,
in January 1987 to try to win freedom for a Lebanese Shiite,
Mohammed Ali Hamdi, now on trial in Frankfurt for the 1985 TWA
hijacking and the shooting death of a U.S. Navy diver. Schmidt, an
engineer, was freed Sept. 7, 1987.
   Just before freeing Cordes, the kidnappers said they would now
try unspecified legal means to win Hamadi's release, but if that
didn't work ``then we shall be obliged to again resort to
violence.''
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Tuesday
that no ransom was paid for Cordes, and no deal was struck. West
German officials have also denied that any ransom was paid for
Schmidt's release.
   Genscher said that he had known since Aug. 24 that after months
of diplomatic efforts, Cordes would be freed on Monday.
   ``It was one of the best-kept secrets in Bonn,'' he said in an
interview with the Deutschlandfunk radio station.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl joined other West Germans in rejoicing
over the release of Cordes. Kohl also praised Syria and Iran for
helping to get him free. ``The Federal Government is extremely
happy over the release of Rudolf Cordes,'' Kohl told a Cabinet
meeting.
   Kohl said good relations between Iran and Syria were key
elements in West Germany's success in winning Cordes' freedom.
``Intense contacts with Iran and Syria were a central point in our
efforts (to gain Cordes' release),'' he said.
   Genscher met several times with Iranian officials over recent
months urging Iran to exert its influence over Cordes' kidnappers
to gain his freedom.
   West German officials had also been in contact with Syria, which
has thousands of troops in Lebanon and has been pressuring Shiite
Moslem militants there to release Western hostages.
   Both Genscher and Kohl pledged West Germany's help in trying to
get other foreign hostages in Lebanon released.
   Seventeen other foreigners, including nine Americans, are still
missing in Lebanon and it is believed most are held by pro-Iranian
Shiite kidnappers. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press, is the longest held. Anderson, 40, was
kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Residents of Cordes' hometown, the Frankfurt suburb of
Fischbach, were jubilant that he was finally coming home.
   ``And now I have only one wish,'' said Mayor Winfried Stephan.
``I hope that Mr. Cordes has been able to withstand the trials of
his captivity. That is the hope of everyone here who knows him and
his family.''

   The National Abortion Rights Action League
endorsed Michael Dukakis for president Tuesday, saying his
appointees to the Supreme Court will ``respect women's right to
decide whether and when to have children.''
   ``Nineteen eighty-eight is truly the year of decision for
reproductive choice in America,'' said Kate Michelman, executive
director of the organization.
   ``Reproductive choice in America has survived eight years of
Ronald Reagan,'' Michelman told a news conference. ``It might not
survive four more years with George Bush.''
   She said Dukakis and his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas, ``have demonstrated true concern for women, for families and
for the rights of individuals.''
   ``Their appointees are likely to respect women's right to decide
whether and when to have children,'' she said.
   She said Republican nominee Bush ``has abandoned reproductive
choice for the rigid views of the far right.''
   Dukakis says he personally opposes abortion, but believes that
decision that should be left to the woman and her doctor. He has
supported government funding of abortion for poor women.
   Bush supports a human life amendment to outlaw abortion except
in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. He
supports government funding only to save the mother's life.

   ``Pope, Tutu clash,'' said a
headline Tuesday in one South African newspaper. ``Tutu and Pope in
agreement,'' said a headline in another.
   The conflicting messages reflected the intense battle being
waged by South African political factions to capitalize on Pope
John Paul II's visit to five neighboring countries.
   The pope is bypassing South Africa, but his comments on issues
such as apartheid, sanctions and political violence are being
analyzed and interpreted here with great intensity and diversity.
   Pro-government media seized upon some of the pope's comments en
route to Harare, Zimbabwe, on Saturday and suggested that he had
repudiated Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   This interpretation was based on the pope's unqualified
denunciation of political violence, and his reservations about
sanctions and election boycotts.
   Tutu advocates sanctions and is urging a boycott of the upcoming
segregated elections. He has repeatedly condemned violence but says
he understands how some South African blacks feel they have no
other alternative in seeking to end white-minority domination.
   One pro-government paper, Beeld, ran a cartoon Tuesday showing
Tutu with a chain of bullets around his neck.
   ``Is this what your rosary looks like?'' the pope asks Tutu, as
they stand near a newspaper poster that reads: ``Pope Strongly
Against Sanctions and Violence.''
   ``It is a pity that Archbishop Tutu was not in Harare to hear
the pope, since he would have learnt what a man of such eminence
has to say in leading the faithful on the paths of reconciliation
and peace,'' said The Citizen, a pro-government daily, in an
editorial Monday.
   ``But then, the pope is a great religious leader, whereas
Archbishop Tutu has decided to involve himself in politics.''
   John Paul also was praised by the state-run South African
Broadcasting Corp. In a commentary Tuesday, it contrasted his
``forthright declarations'' with the ``vagueness, prevarication and
endless qualifications'' from South African clergymen.
   Tutu's spokesman, John Allen, said there are no fundamental
differences between the pope and the archbishop, who met earlier
this year at the Vatican.
   Both oppose violence and agree that strategies such as sanctions
and election boycotts should not be used indiscriminately, if other
effective tactics were available, Allen said.
   The papal visit also has prompted ideological maneuvering in
Marxist-ruled Mozambique. John Paul will travel there Friday on the
last leg of his trip.
   The government-backed newspaper Noticias, in a front-page
editorial Monday, said the visit to Mozambique proves that the pope
sides with ``the peoples of southern Africa'' in a struggle against
``the forces of colonialism, apartheid and destabilization.''
   The editorial denounced the ``hesitations, ambiguities or
collaborationist silence'' of local Roman Catholic leaders who have
urged the government to change its policy and negotiate with the
Mozambique National Resistance guerrilla movement.

<TEXT>
   The House passed by voice vote Tuesday a bill
setting up a new federal program to try to figure out what to do
with the growing number of drug-addicted and AIDS-infected infants
abandoned in hospitals.
   The bill is similar to legislation passed Aug. 5 by the Senate.
Minor differences between the two measures will now have to be
resolved before each chamber votes again and sends the bill to
President Reagan.
   The House bill authorizes $10 million in the next fiscal year
for the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a
program to deal with abandoned infants.
   Growing numbers of children are being abandoned in big-city
hospitals, particularly in New York, California, and Florida,
according to the report accompanying the legislation.
   But there is no accurate number of abandoned children available.
In fact, the legislation directs HHS to survey the program and
report to Congress.
   The abandoned babies are children born of mothers who are drug
addicts or infected with the AIDS virus. Both those conditions can
be passed along to infants.

   Appealing to Vietnam to permit thousands of
people who were detained in re-education camps after the Vietnam
War to leave the country, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Tuesday the United States is prepared to accept up to 94,000
refugees during the next fiscal year.
   But Shultz said that number could be reduced to no more than
70,500, in the 1989 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, if Congress cuts
President Reagan's budget requests.
   ``We want to offer the opportunities of a new home in a new land
to the masses of unfortunates who need and long for these
privileges, as were given to our own forefathers,'' Shultz told the
Senate Judiciary subcommittee which has jurisdiction over the
refugee program.
   Since October 1981, the United States has processed and admitted
to the United States more than 400,000 refugees from Indochina,
200,000 of them from Vietnam, Shultz told the panel.
   But he noted that, ``for reasons not satisfactorily explained,''
the Vietnamese recently suspended cooperation with the United
States on resolving the issues of Americans missing or taken
prisoner of war in Vietnam and the resettlement of Vietnamese who
were sent to re-education camps after the war.
   ``We call upon Vietnam to heal one of the most painful of wounds
remaining from the war _ by responding favorably to the wish of
thousands of re-education camp detainees to be reunited with their
families in the United States or to come with their families to our
country,'' Shultz said.
   ``We hope Vietnam will lift its `temporary' suspension of
cooperation with us on this compelling humanitarian issue,'' he
said.
   Shultz said last year the administration set refugee admissions
numbers that were higher than the funds made avaiilable for the
program by Congress.
   ``This led to confusion and disappointment as the year went on
and the money ran out,'' he said.
   The House and Senate versions of the bill funding the refugee
program contain varying amounts.
   Shultz said that if the final bill provides $338.4 million, the
same amount as last year, that will be enough money to bring in
68,500 refugees, with funds available from other sources to bring
in an additional 2,000.
   A $361.9 million appropriations would pay for resettling 82,000
refugees, with funds avvailable from other federal and private
sources to bring in a total 94,000, he said.
   At the higher level the government would plan to resettle in the
United States 28,000 Vietnamese, including 25,000 Amerasian
immigrants, Shultz said.
   He said that level of funding also would permit resettling
24,500 persons from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, 7,000
people from the Near East and South Asia, 3,500 from Latin America
and the Caribbean and 2,000 from Africa with 4,000 refugees from
all areas to be paid for by private sector contributions.

<HEAD>Government Accuses Solidarity of Violating Agreement on Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday the opposition
has broken terms set by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and the
interior minister that talks on Poland's future be held without
preconditions.
   However, government spokesman Jerzy Urban said he still hoped
the talks would take place and be fruitful. And a member of the
ruling Politburo said on state-run television that the talks still
could begin within the next few days.
   No date has been announced for the discussions, which are to
consider Solidarity's status in addition to the enormous problems
facing Poland.
   Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the Polish United Workers (Communist) party
official in charge of propaganda, said the Politburo was informed
at its normal Tuesday meeting on preparations for the meeting.
   ``We believe that if everything goes well, the round table will
still take place this week,'' Rakowski said.
   Urban complained that resolutions adopted by the opposition
demanded legalization of the trade union Solidarity before the
talks begin.
   ``It was accepted in the talk between (Interior Minister)
Czeslaw Kiszczak and Lech Walesa that talks would be held without
preconditions and limits on subjects,'' Urban said at his weekly
news conference.
   ``This arouses justified doubts about whether some of our
potential partners at the round table really have a will for
dialogue,'' Urban said.
   Urban was referring to a meeting convened by Walesa at St.
Brygida's church in Gdansk over the weekend, where opposition
leaders called on the government to signal its readiness to
``create conditions'' for legalizing the union.
   However, they did not say they considered it an ultimatum.
   Solidarity's information commission responded to Urban's
comments on Tuesday by saying the spokesman ``distorted the
resolutions... None of the aforesaid statements laid down any
preliminary conditions.''
   Urban also said there would be no meeting Wednesday between
Walesa and Kiszczak, as proposed by Solidarity officials, to work
out remaining obstacles to the talks. But the government spokesman
did not exclude a meeting later.
   ``I can rule out, in fact, that this meeting will be held
tomorrow (Wednesday) in view of what I have said about the need for
certain preparations'' for the full-scale talks, he said.
   After nationwide strikes, the government agreed to the
negotiations on Aug. 31 and promised they would cover Solidarity's
future, the broader issue of union pluralism and workers'
grievances.
   Walesa then successfully persuaded strikers to end Poland's
worst wave of labor turmoil in seven years to allow the talks to
begin. The government earlier said that talks would start
automatically once the strikes stopped.

   UNITED NATIONS _ Ten nations have called on the United Nations
to investigate claims that Iraq used poison gas in an attempt to
crush the Kurdish rebellion in its country, an official said
Tuesday.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar conveyed the request
to Iraq's charge d'affaires, Ali Mahmoud Sumaida, said U.N.
spokeswoman Nadia Younes.
   Herbert S. Okun, the second-ranking diplomat at the U.S. Mission
to the United Nations, made the U.S. request Monday to Perez de
Cuellar. Okun acted on behalf of the United States, Britain, Japan
and West Germany, said a spokeswoman for the U.S. mission, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The other nations who requested the investigation were Italy,
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland, she said.
   In Baghdad, an Iraqi official said Tuesday his country probably
would not admit the proposed United Nations team to conduct the
investigation.
   ``This is considered a question of sovereignty and therefore I
do not think we are going to accept that,'' said the official, who
demanded anonymity.
   Iraq has denied charges that it used poison gas in a bloody
offensive against Kurdish guerrillas, a minority people living in
northern Iran, Iraq and eastern Turkey who are fighting for a
separate homeland in northern Iraq.
   Iraq acknowledged on July 1 that it used chemical weapons during
its nearly 8-year-old war with Iran but claimed the Iranians had
used them first.
   In Washington, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Tuesday
the United States has ``compelling'' evidence that Iraq has used
chemical weapons against its Kurdish citizens. But he said the
United Nations should conduct its own probe before being asked to
condemn Iraq for alleged genocide.
   Shultz said the United States reached the conclusion Iraq was
using chemical weapons against the Kurds based on an examination of
Kurdish refugees in Turkey and on ``other evidence which to me
seems to be compelling.''
   About 60,000 Kurds recently fled Iraq to Turkey, citing poison
gas attacks.
   ``I feel our evidence is quite convincing...'' Shultz said.
``But we're not in a position to make that public.''
   The evidence led the Senate on Friday to vote for tough economic
sanctions against Iraq. The measure still must be approved by the
House and signed by President Reagan.
   In Geneva, about 150 Kurds demonstrated outside the U.N. office
Tuesday, calling for the world body to investigate the alleged gas
attacks and shouting ``Saddam, assassin,'' a reference to Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein.
   In Beijing on Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations
Vernon A. Walters said the United States ``is determined the use of
chemical warfare will not become an accepted part of regional
conflicts.''
   Walters spoke to reporters during a tour of Asia to discuss
issues to be considered at the 43rd session of the U.N. General
Assembly, which convenes Sept. 20 in New York.
   In London, the British Foreign Office said it wants an
investigation partly because of State Department evidence of
chemical attacks.
   The Foreign Office said it also based its decision on other
evidence, including reports from Western journalists in Turkey who
have seen Kurdish refugees they say are suffering from poison gas
injuries.
   However, Turkey said Friday it found no evidence of the use of
chemical weapons while examining sick and injured refugees.
   In Tunis, Tunisia, the Arab League said Tuesday that charges of
Iraq's use of chemical weapons were ``fallacious.''
   In Cairo, Egypt criticized the Senate sanctions, and a Foreign
Ministry official said the accusations against Iraq were groundless.
   The U.N. concluded in August following an investigation that
``chemical weapons continue to be used on an intensive scale
against Iranian forces.''
   In March, Iran claimed the Iraqi air force dropped cyanide and
mustard gas bombs on three Kurdish towns in Iraq, killing 5,000
Kurds and injuring 5,000. The towns targeted by the attack had been
captured by Iran.
   The 1925 Geneva Protocol bans the use of chemical or biological
weapons, although their manufacture and stockpiling is allowed to
deter attack.

<HEAD>US Proven Reserves Up Substantially, DOE Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proven reserves of U.S. crude oil rose
surprisingly last year, mainly because oil companies upgraded their
estimates of what Alaskan fields can produce, the Energy Department
said Tuesday.
   The department's Energy Information Administration said the
revisions in estimates of existing reserves were the largest ithas
ever recorded.
   Proven reserves amount to oil in the ground that has been
measured, and is considered producable with ``reasonable
certainty'' with current prices and techniques. Many analysts liken
the category to the on-the-shelf inventory in a store.
   Since the amount recoverable depends on price, with
costly-to-produce formations being passed over when prices are low,
proven reserves will fluctuate even if additions to reserves just
balance production.
   As of Dec. 31, the department said, U.S. proven reserves were
27.256 billion barrels, up 1.4 percent or 367 million barrels from
26.889 billion barrels recorded a year earlier.
   Proven natural gas reserves fell 2.3 percent from 191.6 trillion
cubic feet to 187.2 trillion cubic feet, continuing the trend of
the past six years.
   Alaska crude oil reserves increased 503 million barrels with net
upward revisions in estimates totaling 535 million barrels before
discoveries, other adjustments and production of 718 million
barrels. Projects to recover oil normally left in the ground,
``infill'' drilling to increase production from existing fields and
better estimates of field performance all contributed to the
increases, the department said.
   In the lower 48 states, reserves decreased 0.7 percent or 136
million barrels with net upward revisions in estimates of 1.353
billion barrels before discoveries, other adjustments and
production of 2.155 billion barrels.
   Large gross upward revisions in reserves also were recorded in
California, 505 million barrels, and in West Texas, 477 million
barrels, because of ``enhanced recovery'' efforts to produce oil
from existing fields, the department said.
   Overall Alaska reserves increased 7.3 percent from 6.875 billion
barrels to 7.378 billion barrels. Lower-48 reserves decreased 0.7
percent from 20.014 billion barrels to 19.878 billion barrels.
California reserves fell 0.5 percent from 4.734 billion barrels to
4.709 billion barrels and Texas reserves fell 0.6 percent from
7.152 billion barrels to 7.112 billion barrels.
   For the country as a whole, discoveries added 691 million
barrels to reserves in 1987, 29 percent above the 534 million
barrels added in 1986 but 22 percent below the 1977-1986 average.
   A higher average price for the year, $15.41 per barrel vs.
$12.51 for 1986, enabled oil companies to count more oil in the
``proven'' category, the department said.
   Prices are now falling, said Ed Murphy of the American Petroleum
Institute, the principal trade group.
   Though the Alaska gain was larger than he expected and the
lower-48 decline smaller, he expected, ``the downward trend in
reserves over the last four to six years is apparent,'' he said. In
only two years since 1980, when reserves were 29.805 billion
barrels, have reserves increased, 1984 and 1987.
   The upward revisions from enhanced recovery projects ``are the
result of substantial investments made in the late 1970s and the
early 1980s which are just showing up.''
   Such investments are now declining, and the consequent lack of
production and upward revision in reserve estimates will take a few
years to become apparent, Murphy said.

   Saying people of Hispanic descent have
``written countless chapters in the unique saga of the United

``National Hispanic Heritage Week.''
   ``Hispanic Americans give many gifts to our nation, such as
perpetuating the traditions of their ancestral homelands and
offering a great array of talents and insights as they achieve and
excel in every area of endeavor,'' the president said in the
proclamation.
   ``Let us pause during National Hispanic Heritage Week, 1988, to
reflect on the many and varied cultural heritages of
Hispanic-Americans and on the continuing and growing part these
citizens play in affirming America's heritage of faith, freedom,
brotherhood and opportunity and in creating that heritage anew.''

<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts of the speech PLO
leader Yasser Arafat delivered in a closed session to some members
of the European Parliament. The text of the speech was released by
the Parliament's Socialist political group, which invited Arafat to
speak:
   I realize you have a lot of queries, especially in the light of
the historic steadfastness of the Palestinian people as manifested
by the uprising of its masses to end the occupation and wrest
independence.
   Granted, they are legitimate queries: It is your right to get
clear and specific answers to them from us outlining our overall
line of thinking and action, without necessarily going into
specific details, especially when they are sensitive. The final
decision on these rests with our own parliament, the Palestine
National Council ...
   The intefadeh (Arabic for uprising) was an expression of the
extent of our people's alertness and their determination to resist
the occupation by all means at their disposal, exercising thereby
their legal right under the U.N. charter and resolutions.
   Today, our people are confronting the iron fist policy and the
Israeli war machine with stones, children and youths, creating the
image of a Palestinian David pitted against a Goliath armed to the
teeth with the latest means of warfare and destruction.
   We had hoped that the sight of children yielding stones to
confront armored vehicles, gunfire and suffocating gas would be
sufficient to arouse the conscience of the Israeli occupiers and to
open their minds to the future, realizing that recognition of the
Palestinian people and their right to self-determination and
independence is the only road to peace _ away from the massacres
and daily killings to which our men, women and children are being
subjected and in favor of a future built on peace and justice for
all. ...
   I hereby declare that the people of the intefadeh, the
Palestinian people whom I represent, are committed to peace based
on justice. Our heritage and culture and our Islam, Christianity
and Judaism disallow hatred and repudiate aggression. Inasmuch as
they open our minds to peace based on justice, they shape our
resolve to defend ourselves, uphold our rights, and resist the
occupation.
   We respect our international commitments. We also respect
international legitimacy. At the same time, we believe that a just
peace cannot be achieved through the selective application of half
what international legitimacy provided for and the dumping of the
other half.
   That is why it is imperative that we witness and sense the
respect by Israel and the U.S. administration of international
resolutions, particularly those upholding the Palestinian people's
right to self-determination and statehood, and which constitute the
cornerstone of the proposed international peace conference. ...
   It would be possible at the said conference and through the
negotiations which will take place within its framework to discuss
and agree (on) arrangements for international guarantees of peace
among all states of the region, including the independent
Palestinian state. ...
   We endorse the charter of the United Nations organization and
all its resolutions, including 242 and 338. International
legitimacy is an indivisible whole and no one can choose to accept
only what suits him and discard what does not. ...
   Consequently, we declare our acceptance of one of the two
following options as the basis for convening the international
conference under U.N. auspices and with the participation of the
Security Council permanent members and all parties to the conflict
in the region, including the PLO and Israel:
   a. All U.N. resolutions relevant to the Palestine Question,
including Security Council resolutions 242 and 338.
   b. Resolutions 242 and 338 along with the legitimate rights of
the Palestinian people, foremost among which is their right to
self-determination.
   ... In order to create an atmosphere of good will conducive to a
just peace, we responded positively _ and still do _ to all
proposals calling for the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation
forces from the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 and
placing these under U.N. administration or an internationally
supervised European force for a limited interim period. The
proposed international force could stay on after the establishment
of the independent Palestinian state for as long as the Security
Council deems necessary to guarantee the security of everyone
concerned. ...
   We all know of the measures recently adopted by Jordan
concerning the West Bank.
   The PLO Central Council accepted these measures and decided to
shoulder the responsibilities resulting therefrom, including the
political among them, regardless of the timing and the manner in
which the measures were introduced _ without consultation or
coordination with us _ and irrespective of the difficulties which
we found ourselves facing.
   The Jordanian measures ended the European, American and Israeli
debate on Palestinian representation and the international
conference.
   No one can claim anymore that there is someone else to share
with the PLO the representation of the Palestinian people,
particularly after the cessation of the Jordanian option and the
failure of the autonomy option. The only option left is the right,
realistic and irreplaceable one - namely, the Palestinian option,
the essence of which is the independent Palestinian state...
   We are working to set up an independent Palestinian state on the
land liberated from Israeli occupation. This state will have a
republican, democratic and multi-party system; it will abide by the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and will not discriminate
among its citizens on the basis of color, race or religion
   We are at a crucial stage. The Palestinian state, the key to
peace, security and development in the Arab region...is in the
offing.''

<TEXT>
   The U.N.-sponsored peace talks between Iran and
Iraq, stalled since they started almost three weeks ago, went into
recess Tuesday and will move temporarily to New York.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar hopes to unblock the
negotiations at U.N. headquarters there.
   U.N. mediator Jan Eliasson of Sweden said both sides accepted an
invitation by Perez de Cuellar to continue direct talks ``soon'' at
U.N. headquarters. He said they agreed to return to Geneva for
subsequent meetings.
   Eliasson has been presiding over the talks since last week as
the U.N. chief's personal representative. He said Perez de Cuellar
invited foreign ministers Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and Tariq Aziz
of Iraq to meet in New York on Sept. 22. But the Iraqi delegation
said in a statement issued Tuesday night that Aziz could not be in
New York before the first week of October.
   The statement indicated that acceptance of ``one meeting'' in
New York was conditional on agreeing on a binding date for
reconvening the talks in Geneva.
   Eliasson told a news conference earlier Tuesday that both Iran
and Iraq ``seem committed to keep the peace process going'' and
both confirmed that they will continue to observe the cease-fire.
The truce went into effect Aug. 20 after nearly eight years of
fighting and about 1 million dead or wounded.
   The talks in Geneva began on Aug. 25.
   Eliasson conceded that ``on issues of substance there has been
little if any progress'' but said the most important thing at this
stage was that ``the peace process is kept alive.''
   The talks bogged down over differing priorities. Iran wants them
to stick to implementation of U.N. cease-fire resolution 598,
starting with withdrawal of ``all forces to the internationally
recognized boundaries without delay.'' Iraq wants the negotiations
to focus first on clearing the Shatt-el-Arab waterway, its main
link to the sea, and on freedom of negotiation in the Persian Gulf.

   Roger Hargreaves, who turned his deskpad doodlings
into the popular ``Mister Men'' and ``Little Miss'' storybooks for
children, died of a heart attack at his home near London, death
notices said Tuesday. He was 53.
   The Times of London said Hargreaves died Monday.
   Hargreaves, a laundryman's son, was born in the northern English
county of Yorkshire and went into advertising after service in the
Royal Air Force. His career prospered but he said boredom turned
him to writing children's stories.
   Combining his doodles with bed-time stories he made up for his
own children, it took Hargreaves just two weeks to find a publisher
and in 1972 his first six stories went on sale. They introduced
young readers to Mister Bump, Mister Strong and Mister Sneezy.
   In 1981 he began a series featuring such characters as Little
Miss Fussy and Little Miss Sunshine.
   His texts were simple and his drawings childlike _ bold colors,
a few lines, some squares and dots.
   The books, published in soft cover, were inexpensive.
   Some 85 million are in circulation, translated into 22 languages.
   The stories have more than 750 characters and spinoffs include a
television cartoon series and childrens' cups and plates,
stationery and clothing.
   Hargreaves is survived by a wife, two daughters, two sons, and a
granddaughter.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan got a grim report on the
status of the nation's forest fires on Tuesday and was told there
is no way to predict when the blazes will be tamed.
   ``We are fighting with everything at hand,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman met with reporters after Reagan was briefed on the
forest fire situation by Interior Secretary Donald Hodel,
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Deputy Defense Secretary
William H. Taft at the White House.
   Fitzwater described their session with Reagan as an ``update''
and said there were no new efforts to be announced following the
session.
   ``No one could give a prognosis of when the fires would be put
out, but it is clear that we have dedicated all of the resources
available and all of our energies, and the goal is the same for
everyone _ and that is, put those fires out,'' Fitzwater said.
   The meeting came as thousands of firefighters continued to
battle blazes in eight states, particularly California, Montana,
Colorado, Idaho, Utah, Oregon and Washington state.
   It also followed harsh words on the government's ``let-burn''
approach to the fires from a usually strong Reagan administration
supporter, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who called the situation ``a
catastrophe.''
   Fitzwater, asked if the president had been given a ``worst-case
scenario'' of the devastation in the briefing, shot back, ``We are
in the worst case.''
   He did note later, however, that some of the officials had
expressed ``some cautious optimism'' about prospects for calming
the fires.
   Hodel, Lyng and Taft had traveled West to review the situation
over the weekend.
   ``The president has been assured that we have been doing
everything possible,'' Fitzwater said.
   He noted that some 30,000 firefighters were involved in battling
32 fires in eight Western states, with approximately 4 million
acres burned.
   With the most recently dispatched military personnel on station
by mid-week, Fitzwater said, some 2,300 soldiers and 22 aircraft
had been sent to Yellowstone National Park alone to battle the
fires.
   ``The president has repeatedly expressed his concern for the
people living in the fire areas, for the welfare of their families,
for their businesses and occupations, and for the hardship that has
undoubtedly consumed their lives,'' Fitzwater said.
   He called the situation ``a natural disaster of unprecendented
proportions'' and said the people in the area and government
officials ``have responded with great selflessness and
determination to get the situation under control.''
   ``We will continue to work tirelessly to put out these fires,''
Fitzwater pledged.
   Earlier in the day, Reagan had said he'd not been aware of a
U.S. Park Service policy permitting some forest lands to burn, and
said that the policy has been scrapped.
   Asked what he thought of the so-called ``let-burn'' policy that
has been carried out by the Interior Department in recent years,
Reagan told reporters, ``I have questioned it. I did not even know
it existed, frankly.''
   Answering questions as he headed back into the Oval Office after
signing the fair housing bill, Reagan said that when Hodel arrived
in Wyoming last weekend, ``he made it plain that ... we were
withdrawing from this policy.''
   Asked how the administration planned to deal with any new
outbreaks of fires, Fitzwater said the ``let burn'' policy had been
dropped in July and that all new fires would be put out.
   The spokesman refused to entertain any discussion of the
criticism of the administration's controversial policy. But he
noted that since the nation has never faced such an outbreak of
fires before, the time ``certainly calls for some review of the
policy.''
   ``It's not a clear case of what's right and what's wrong,'' he
said. ``At this point, what's clear is that the fires are out of
control. ... We have extraordinary drought conditions and there is
no need to argue over policy differences until we come up with the
next firefighting season next year. Right now, its all-out,
fight-the-fires.''
   The government's let-burn policy has been harshly criticized by
House and Senate members from the Western states.
   Hatch, speaking to reporters after visiting the White House,
said, ``We all knew how dry it was and a lot of us were saying,
`Hey, Don't let this burn and they could have contained it at that
time.'''
   Some 8,000 firefighters have worked in past days to dampen fires
in Yellowstone National Park, where the historic fires have charred
939,270 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park since June.
   Referring to the damage done to Yellowstone, Hatch went on:
``Now you have a million acres lost in one of the most important
national park areas in the world. ... It's a catastrophe....''
   Without explanation the senator added, ``I suspect it comes from
just too much extremism in the environmental area and a lot of our
people in the West are very disappointed, very disenchanted about
it.''
   House Republican leader Robert Michel, emerging from a meeting
of GOP congressional leaders with the president earlier, also said
that he had not been aware of the policy. ``This let-burn policy
obviously is going to come under review,'' Michel said.

   The hasty departure of seven advisers to
George Bush with alleged ties to anti-Semitic activities
underscores how firmly James A. Baker III has taken charge of the
Republican nominee's campaign, according to top aides.
   ``Jim Baker is a guy who likes to get things resolved,'' said a
senior campaign official who spoke only on condition that he not be
identified.
   A top Bush adviser said the campaign was ``totally blindsided''
by the allegations of anti-Semitic activities, which surfaced last
Wednesday as the vice president prepared to address a national
B'nai B'rith convention in Baltimore.
   Circulated at that convention were copies of an article in
Washington Jewish Week which raised questions about members of the
the campaign's ethnic coalition. Baker met with Bush that evening
and discussed the smoldering controversy, aides said.
   Tension built over the weekend with a report in The Washington
Post that Frederic V. Malek, a senior Bush operative on the
Republican National Committee, had collected information on Jewish
officials in the Bureau of Labor Statistics for President Nixon in
1971.
   Malek resigned the same day, saying he was quitting for the sake
of the Bush campaign. He acknowledged collecting the data but
denied he had anything to do with the Jewish officials' later
demotions.
   Campaign sources said six members of Bush's Coalition for
American Nationalities who resigned had been approached by campaign
officials and told of Baker's resolve to take ``firm and decisive
action.''
   The situation was spelled out to those involved, said one top
official, and they were asked ``what do you folks want to do?''
   ``These individuals came to this conclusion (to resign) on their
own anyway,'' the official said.
   Five of the ethnic officials resigned Monday. The Bush campaign
announced the sixth resignation on Tuesday, when Radi Slavoff quit
as national co-chairman of Bulgarians for Bush.
   ``It was accepted. I think we're over it now,'' said Bush
spokesman Mark Goodin.
   Slavoff's resignation followed a story in the Philadelphia
Inquirer that identified him as former chief of a Bulgarian group
formed after World War II which consisted of members of the
Nazi-aligned Bulgarian Legion.
   The other five resigned after published reports linked them to
anti-Jewish or fascist activities.
   Bush campaign sources said they had no plans to replace Malek as
deputy Republican national chairman.
   The resignation of Malek and the six ethnic advisers occurred
with a lightning speed that would have been impossible before
Baker, the former treasury secretary and White House chief of
staff, took command of the Bush campaign, aides said.
   Even though Bush vigorously denied that any of the departing
officials were anti-Semitic, the resignations were viewed as a way
to distance the vice president quickly from a potentially explosive
campaign issue.
   Those who resigned said they were leaving to avoid any political
embarrassment to Bush, not because there was any substance to the
allegations of anti-Semitism.
   Bush, speaking Tuesday aboard Air Force Two, expressed
irritation at the allegations, saying: ``We are going through an
interesting period here, without hard evidence on various things. I
don't like the allegations about people, and I don't like it being
injected into the campaign.''
   Bush refused to say whether Malek would be given a position in a
Bush administration, but said he had ``a lot of confidence'' in
Malek.
   President Reagan declared Tuesday that ``there isn't one iota of
discrimination'' among members of the coalition created to court
ethnic votes.
   Reagan told reporters at the White House he believed the ethnic
advisers resigned ``because they didn't want to harm the campaign.''
   Before Baker's arrival, the Bush campaign was managed by a
committee of six advisers and marked by frequent squabbles between
Bush's campaign officials and his vice presidential office.
   Aides said Baker quickly established new lines of authority.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, and Lee Atwater, the
campaign manager, had shared overlapping responsibility for Bush's
overall campaign activities in the past.
   Under Baker's reorganization, Fuller is responsible only for
scheduling and Atwater for political activities, the sources said.

   The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide is
a hero to the poor and hated by the government, a target of both
adulation and assassination for his outspoken criticism of Haiti's
military regime.
   The Roman Catholic priest was saying morning Mass last Sunday
when 20 to 30 thugs armed with knives, machetes and guns burst into
the St. Jean Bosco church in Port-Au-Prince and randomly
slaughtered worshipers.
   Six people were confirmed dead and 77 wounded, witnesses and
hospital officials said.
   Despite the carnage, witnesses said parishioners surrounded the
priest and protected him with their bodies, sweeping him to safety
and into hiding. Aristide is perhaps the most popular figure among
Haiti's slum-dwelling masses.
   During his sermons, in which he vigorously denounced army terror
and atrocities, his small, cement-block church in the La Saline
slum was regularly packed with exuberant, sometimes hysterical
supporters. He has often led them into the streets for
demonstrations during periods of unrest.
   ``Satan is eating us everywhere,'' Aristide said of the army
during a wave of anti-government demonstrations and harsh
repression in June and July of 1987. ``They (the army) are the
savages. Those who load their guns and shoot our children.''
   Since the riots that summer, gunmen in speeding cars have
frequently sprayed gunfire at the wall of his church's compound and
the homes of other Salesian priests close to Aristide.
   On Aug. 23, 1987, Aristide and four other priests were ambushed
near St. Marc on the main north-south highway 60 miles north of the
capital, Port-au-Prince.
   As they returned from a Mass in memory of a recent peasant
massacre, about 40 men armed with machine guns, stones and clubs
attacked their car, injuring two of the priests. Soldiers at a
checkpoint 70 yards away did not intervene.
   Aristide escaped and went into hiding for several weeks
following the incident.
   During a Sunday Mass on Sept. 4, a man entered Aristide's church
with a gun stuck in his belt. The man fled after parishioners
wrestled him to the ground and seized the pistol.
   Aristide's name and those of other opposition leaders are on a
``death list'' of people marked for assassination which has
circulated in Port-au-Prince.
   Aristide, who preaches that Marxism and Christianity are
compatible, has not actually called for an armed uprising, but
repeatedly advocated the overthrow of the Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy's
military government by ``active non-violent struggle.''
   The conservative hierarchy of the church has rejected Aristide's
``notion of class struggle.'' In April the church leadership
apparently attempted to rob Aristide of his power base _ the
capital's slums _ by transferring him to a remote rural parish
north of Port-au-Prince.
   For several days a dozen of his youthful followers occupied the
Notre Dame Cathedral in the capital and went on a hunger strike
which forced the bishops to rescind their order.
   Aristide, in his mid-30s, was ordained by his uncle, Bishop
Willie Romelus of the western town of Jeremie, who is the only
openly anti-military member of Haiti's 10-member Bishops Conference.
   Although the bishops have never called for the overthrow of
Namphy's government, they issued a statement last month that echoed
one made by Pope John Paul II during a tour of Haiti in 1983 which
said ``things must change'' in the impoverished nation.
   The statement protested the expulsion of a priest, the
assassination of human rights leader Lafontant Joseph in July and
accused the military government of authoritarian rule and disregard
for human life.
   Pope John's visit helped crystalize public repudiation of the
dictatorship of Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled to exile in France
on Feb. 7, 1986.

   Two national polls Tuesday found George Bush
pulling past Michael Dukakis in the presidential race, and they
indicated that Bush has scored points by pressing the Pledge of
Allegiance as an issue.
   Bush led by eight points in both national surveys, 47-39 percent
in a CBS News-New York Times poll and 49-41 percent in a Gallup
poll. The Gallup poll found Dukakis suffering his highest negative
rating of the race.
   Two polls released Monday showed a closer race, but two surveys
last week found Bush leading by six and eight points respectively.
Moreover, the new polls found support for Bush on underlying issues
he has been pressing.
   On defense, 28 percent of the probable voters in the CBS-Times
poll said Bush would make the nation stronger and only 4 percent
said he would make it weaker. By contrast, 39 percent said Dukakis
would make U.S. defenses weaker, and just 13 percent said he would
make the nation stronger. The rest in both cases said defenses
would remain unchanged.
   In another measure, Gallup found that 68 percent of the
registered voters it interviewed had heard of the Pledge of
Allegiance issue, and by a 2-1 margin they had a less favorable
view of Dukakis because of it.
   Bush, in what has become a repeated refrain, has criticized
Dukakis for vetoing legislation in Massachusetts requiring teachers
to lead classes in the Pledge. Dukakis said he acted on the basis
of a court opinion that the law was unconstitutional, and he
accused Bush of impugning his patriotism.
   But 70 percent in the CBS-Times poll said teachers should be
required to lead pupils in the pledge. And half of that group said
it should be mandated even if the courts ruled the requirement
unconstitutional.
   Bush also has been stressing environmental issues, traditionally
a strong suit for Democrats, and the CBS-Times poll found him
ranked nearly evenly with Dukakis on protecting the environment.
   The CBS-Times poll even found backing for Bush on an issue
Dukakis had sought to make his own: competence. Fifty-one percent
said Bush would be more competent at managing the federal
government, to 32 percent for Dukakis.
   Overall, the Gallup survey found 40 percent expressing an
unfavorable view of Dukakis, up from 32 percent three weeks ago and
the highest all year for Dukakis in Gallup's poll. Dukakis was
rated favorably by more voters, 53 percent, but Bush bettered him
in both ratings, with 59 percent favorable and 35 percent
unfavorable.
   Dukakis' confidence rating suffered in the CBS-Times poll, but
in that measure Bush's score worsened as well. Fifty-nine percent
said they would be uneasy with Dukakis in an international crisis,
up from 53 percent just after the Republican convention last month.
   Fewer _ 47 percent _ said they would be uneasy with Bush in a
crisis, but that was up 10 points from the post-convention poll.
Also, 45 percent said they would be confident with Bush, down from
51 percent; for Dukakis, 28 percent expressed confidence, little
changed from 29 percent.
   Dukakis continued to lead Bush on one other key issue:
Forty-seven percent said the Democrat would do more to help the
middle class, while 33 percent picked Bush.
   Finally, Bush encountered a low rating on his choice of Sen. Dan
Quayle of Indiana as his running mate. Fifty-eight percent said
they would be worried about Quayle stepping in as president if
something happened to Bush, and just 32 percent said Quayle was
qualified to serve as president.
   The CBS-Times poll was conducted among 1,043 probably voters
from Thursday through Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points. The Gallup poll was done Friday through
Sunday among 1,003 registered voters and was given a four-point
margin of error.

   A man was charged Tuesday in a federal
indictment with attempting to kill Democratic presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis.
   The three-count indictment said Stephen W. Kimberling, 36, of
Springfield, told an unidentified party that he would shoot Dukakis.
   Kimberling was arrested Sept. 2 as he tried to board a plane at
Springfield Regional Airport. He was carrying a pistol and a 7-inch
hunting knife in his flight bag, authorities said.
   Kimberling has been undergoing evaluation at the psychiatric
unit of the federal prison medical center in Springfield since his
arrest.
   Kimberling was charged Tuesday with carrying concealed weapons,
attempting to kill a major presidential candidate _ a count
carrying a possible penalty of life in prison _ and threatening to
kill a major presidential candidate.
   He appeared before U.S. Magistrate James England shortly after
the indictment was issued Tuesday. England set a Friday hearing at
which Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Jones indicated he would ask
that Kimberling be held without bail.
   England ordered that Kimberling be held until Friday.
   Jones would not elaborate on the information contained in the
indictment.
   ``I can't tell you what the evidence is,'' he said.
   Initial reports indicated Kimberling had threatened Vice
President George Bush, but authorities later discounted those
reports.
   The flight Kimberling attempted to board was headed to Los
Angeles, where the Republican nominee appeared three days later,
and police said Kimberling was carrying documents pertaining to
Bush's campaign.

   Rain was scattered along the Rockies and across the South and
parts of the East on Tuesday, while the outer fringes of Hurricane
Gilbert brushed the Florida Keys with rain squalls and strong wind
gusts.
   Wind gusted to 39 mph at Key West Airport and tides ran 1 to 2
feet above normal.
   The hurricane's center was located far south of the Keys moving
towards the west-northwest.
   Its maximum sustained wind speed increased to 160 mph.
   This storm had become a category 5 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson scale, on which category 1 is the weakest and
category 5 the strongest, the National Weather Service said.
   Showers were scattered over western New Mexico, and northwestern
Wyoming.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended over the northern half of
Texas, the Gulf Coast states, Alabama and Florida.
   Wichita Falls, Texas, had a wind gust to 60 mph during a
thunderstorm that dumped more than 1.5 inches of rain.
   Showers were scattered across southeastern Ohio, northern West
Virginia, southwestern Pennsylvania and northeastern Pennsylvania.
   Storms that dumped 2 to over 6 inches of rain on northern
Alabama on Monday caused the Paint Rock River to crest Tuesday more
than 5 feet above its banks at Woodville, Ala., the weather service
said.
   In northeastern Florida, the Saint Marys River was 2 feet above
flood stage near Macclenny, the agency said. Lower river access
roads were flooded.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 45
degrees at Cody, Lander, Riverton and Yellowstone National Park,
Wyo., to 96 at Thermal, Calif. Tuesday morning's low was 21 degrees
at Truckee, Calif.
   For Wednesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
across eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle, and over eastern
Louisiana, southern Mississippi and the Florida Peninsula.
Scattered showers were forecast over western Colorado, northeastern
Utah, most of Wyoming, and western Nebraska and western South
Dakota. Snow showers were forecast at higher elevations of the
central Rockies. Scattered showers were forecast over northern New
England and northern New York state.
   Highs in the 50s and 60s were predicted over the central
Rockies; in the 60s from northern Minnesota across the northern
section of the upper Great Lakes to northern New England; in the
90s over the inland valleys of California and Oregon, eastern
Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley, the Gulf Coast, Florida, and
extreme eastern sections of the southern Atlantic Coast states;
around 100 over the desert Southwest; and in the 70s and 80s over
the remainder of the nation.

<TEXT>
   A high-ranking official said Tuesday that
Iraq is moving many Kurds from small villages for security or
better services, but insisted it is not trying to wipe them out or
change their style of life.
   Kurdish rebel groups and others have denounced Iraq's policy of
demolishing small villages and relocating their population. The
U.S. Senate suggested on Friday such acts were connected with
``genocide'' against the Kurdish people.
   But the official, Nizar Hamdoon, deputy foreign secretary and
former Iraqi ambassador to the United States, said in an interview
that the government has no intention ``to change the life of the
Kurds.''
   Asked about reports of widespread relocations, he said: ``If
you're talking about the border area, the reasons are mainly
security reasons, so that (rebel) infiltration stops.
   ``With development ... it's more feasible to bring people
together to provide better services.''
   Hamdoon said some of the Kurdish rebels who were offered amnesty
after fleeing to Turkey would be relocated if they return.
   ``Obviously, for security reasons we have to relocate some of
them ... but they will be provided with a place within Kurdistan,''
he said, refering to the remote northern region of Iraq where Kurds
live.
   Following a round of fighting that ended in 1975, Iraq
demolished a string of villages along its border with Iran and
moved their people.
   Over the last year, Baghdad-based diplomats said the Iraqi army
demolished scores of other small villages in the mountainous
Kurdish territories and moved the people into towns or new concrete
apartment blocks along main roads.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
intention seemed to be to keep closer watch on the Kurds and rob
the rebels of village sanctuaries in the rugged mountains.
   Iraq grants its 2.5 million to 3 million Kurdish inhabitants a
form of regional autonomy, including their own assembly and use of
the Kurdish language.
   Rebel groups demand wider autonomy or creation of an independent
state. An additional 6 million Kurds live in Turkey, Iran, the
Soviet Union and Syria.
   Hamdoon noted that none of those countries granted the Kurds any
form of autonomy.
   He said the policy of moving Iraqis from remote villages to
larger towns is not limited to Kurdistan.
   He said similar moves had also taken place in the marshy Misan
province in the south; the Kut region, south of Baghdad, and the
western deserts.
   Observers who visited eastern Kurdistan said they saw only a few
small villages still standing along the main roads, and many old
ones bulldozed.
   But an Associated Press reporter who recently visited the
northern town of Amadiya, 12 miles from the Turkish border, said
relatively few destroyed villages were visible and several small
ones still were standing and populated.
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
conveyed to Iraq's charge d'affaires, Ali Mahmoud Sumaida, on
Tuesday a request from 10 nations, including America, that Iraq let
chemical weapons experts go there to investigate claims that Iraq
used poison gas to crush the Kurdish uprising.
   Iraq denies using gas against the Kurds, but previously
acknowledged using chemical weapons against Iran in their
8-year-old war.
   An Iraqi official said in Baghdad that Iraq probably would not
admit such a proposed U.N. team as a matter of sovereignty.

<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who predicted all the faithful
would be called to heaven by Tuesday morning, leaving a warring
world of non-believers, has revised his prediction.
   Edgar C. Whisenant now believes a process called the Rapture
will begin at 9:55 a.m. CDT Wednesday, said Dianne McArthur,
general manager of Christian radio station KAAY at Little Rock.
   Whisenant will not consent to interviews with the secular press,
Mrs. McArthur said. Calls to Whisenant's Rapture 88 Ministries in
Little Rock were greeted by an answering machine, and Whisenant did
not return a call to The Associated Press.
   Whisenant, 56, a retired civil engineer and self-taught Bible
student, has predicted on broadcasts carried by more than 90 radio
stations nationwide that Jesus would ``rapture the church'' _ take
the faithful to heaven _ on Sept. 11, 12 or 13.
   Mrs. McArthur said she spoke with Whisenant on Monday.
   ``I wanted to nail down when he felt like was the last possible
moment before the rapture,'' she said.
   That's when she discovered Whisenant's revision.
   ``All through this, Edgar has been basing things on Jerusalem
time because he feels like God's heart is in Jerusalem,'' Mrs.
McArthur said.
   But Whisenant was reminded Monday of Bible teachings that the
rapture will not occur until the last trumpet blast on earth
signaling the end of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year, Mrs.
McArthur said.
   Whisenant figures the last trumpet blast will occur along the
international date line, and that will signal Christians that they
are about ``to meet the Lord in the clouds,'' she said. ``As best
he can calculate it, that looks like 9:55 a.m. Wednesday.''

   Seventy-five days after he set sail, and
44 days after he was reported missing at sea, Donovan Jones
returned to dry land Tuesday with new respect for canned food and
the Coast Guard.
   The 58-year-old Eugene, Ore., man had planned to sail his
32-foot wooden sloop from Marina Del Rey in southern California to
Oahu, Hawaii. He left in late June expecting to arrive by late July.
   ``I'm not an old salt or anything like that, but I'm not a
novice,'' he said.
   On July 31, his family reported him missing.
   ``I'm married, but I did tell my wife before I left not to call
the Coast Guard. I told her it takes a long time to get anywhere,''
he said during a telephone interview with The Associated Press
minutes after he reached land here in northern California.
   ``I haven't called her yet.''
   Jones' plans went astray shortly after he left. He headed south,
then turned west at 16 degrees north latitude to swing over toward
Hawaii.
   ``And then a storm came along and blew me south and to the west
of Hawaii,'' he said.
   Because of prevailing wind patterns, ``I couldn't come back
(northeast) to Hawaii against the wind, so I decided to come back
to the mainland.''
   With his radio batteries dead, he slowly worked his way through
a small stock of canned food and vitamins. He dragged a line in
hopes of catching fish, but ``I guess I'm not much of a fisherman.''
   He hadn't had a chance to weigh himself yet, but guessed he lost
20 to 25 pounds.
   Early Sunday, when he was just 100 miles off Eureka, a large
storm came up and ripped away his hatch cover.
   ``Everything was in a shambles inside and I was having a hard
time keeping the water out,'' Jones said. Then another sailboat
came along and called the Coast Guard on its radio.
   A Coast Guard helicopter flew out a portable generator to power
Jones' radio and some rations. Then a Coast Guard boat towed him
into Humboldt Bay.
   ``The Coast Guard was really wonderful, and I can't say enough
about them,'' said Jones.
   He isn't ready to give up sailing just because of one
misadventure.
   ``I love the sea, and this hasn't changed me so far as I want to
give it up,'' he said. ``I feel healthier since I've sailed. Life
in the city isn't good for you.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some comments Tuesday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, underscoring his theme that Dan Quayle is not
up to dealing forcefully with the Soviet Union, and noting that
three vice presidents since 1945 later had to deal with the Soviets
as president: ``Dan Quayle is no Gerald Ford. He's no Lyndon
Johnson. And he sure ain't Harry Truman. Can we stake our future on
the hope that he is a match for Mikhail Gorbachev?''
   
   DAN QUAYLE, in a zinger aimed at Dukakis' foreign policy
credentials: ``Want to hear a sad story about the Dukakis campaign?
The governor of Massachusetts, he lost his top naval adviser last
week. His rubber duck drowned in his bathtub.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, attacking Dukakis' plan for a federally funded,
regional job-creation and economic development program: ``All you
need to do is to make a small down payment, $500 million, to get
those industrial planning technocrats to work in Washington. My
opponent calls this kind of government `the helping hand.' Well,
where is the helping hand reaching? Right for the wallet.''
   
   PRESIDENT REAGAN, railing on the Democratic proposal to
reimburse providers of child care who meet federal standards: ``And
that means if you want to leave your child with his grandmother
during the day, she will have to be licensed under federal
standards if she's to be given assistance for helping to raise her
grandhild. Licensing grandmothers. Can you believe it? ''

<HEAD>Fighting Leaves More Than 100 Salvadorans Dead or Wounded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EL PARAISO, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 Salvadorans were
killed or wounded in fighting between rebels and troops and in
clashes between students and riot police Monday and Tuesday,
officials, witnesses and news reports said.
   About 150 leftist rebels attacked the garrison at El Paraiso,
headquarters of the 4th Army Brigade, shortly after 1 a.m. Tuesday
with mortars and small arms fire.
   A two-hour battle left nine soldiers and seven guerrillas dead,
according to Col. Ciro Lopez Roque, garrison commander. He said 12
soldiers and an undetermined number of rebels were wounded.
   Col. Galileo Torres, head of the armed forces press office, told
The Associated Press in a telephone interview that government
forces inflicted 50 casualties on guerrillas in northern Morazan
province between late Monday and shortly before dawn Tuesday. No
breakdown of dead and wounded was given.
   Morazan and Chalatenango are the two of El Salvador's 14
provinces where guerrillas maintain a constant presence, move
freely and administer some towns and villages.
   In the capital, about 300 riot troops clashed with approximately
3,000 university students marching to the Finance Ministry to
demand increased government spending on education.
   The helmeted troopers, some carrying assault rifles and others
toting plastic shields and nightsticks, fell in behind the marchers
and continuously prodded, shoved and insulted the demonstrators.
   When one student turned to confront them, he was beaten by
several troopers. A melee ensued, with sporadic pistol and rifle
fire resounding through the streets for nearly 30 minutes. The
troopers fired tear gas to disperse the demonstrators.
   Officers on the scene said urban commandos of the leftist
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front fired pistols from within
the crowd of demonstrators.
   Reporters saw more than 200 demonstrators arrested and shoved
into buses. Several were bleeding from beatings.
   A riot trooper told the AP a policeman was killed by fire from
the demonstrators.
   The riot troops shoved and insulted journalists, fired bursts
low over their heads and forced them to lie face-down on the
pavement.
   ``Don't move!,'' one shouted at the prostrate reporters. ``This
is what you get for only telling lies!''
   The National Police, contacted by the AP, declined immediate
comment on the clash in San Salvador.
   In the western provincial capital of Santa Ana, troops of the
2nd Infantry Brigade tangled with local university students
marching to demand a bigger budget.
   The independent radio station KL reported from Santa Ana that
gunfire wounded two students and two soldiers, that 20
demonstrators were beaten and an undetermined number were arrested.
   At El Paraiso, reporters were shown the bodies of six guerrillas
on the base's soccer field. Lopez Roque said the body of a woman
guerrilla was found about a half-mile from the base.
   Troops were still mopping up around Morazan's Gigante Hill
outside Perquin, 125 miles northeast of San Salvador, as of midday,
Torres said.
   There was no way to immediately confirm the official casualty
figures.
   Early this month, the military press office said 25 guerrillas
were killed during combat around Tejutepeque in central El
Salvador. Reporters who went to the scene found four rebels killed.
   Precise casualty figures are hard to pin down as the guerrillas
make every effort to remove their dead from the battlefield.
   Five soldiers were wounded in the Morazan fighting, Torres said.
   Torres said reporters would not be taken to the combat zone
since helicopters ferrying wounded soldiers and supplies came under
guerrilla fire hours after the fighting stopped.

<HEAD>Dukakis Doubts Bush Could Deal With Gorbachev; Bush Talks Recovery</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: EDITS and UDPATES throughout to include new poll results and
Bush comments on latest resignation, and to tighten.
^By DAVID ESPO</NOTE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis questioned on Tuesday how George Bush would be
able to deal with Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev ``if he couldn't
stand up to the ayatollah or say `no' to Noriega.'' The vice
president preached the gospel of Republican prosperity and said
America is a ``rising nation again.''
   GOP vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle got off the snappiest
one-liner of the day when he announced to a Milwaukee audience that
Dukakis had lost his top naval adviser. ``His rubber duck drowned
in his bathtub,'' Quayle said in another in a series of comments
designed to undercut the Democratic candidate's foreign policy and
defense credentials.
   Bush campaigned as two new national polls found Bush pulling
ahead of Dukakis by eight points. Bush led by 47 percent to 39
percent in a CBS News-New York Times poll and 49 percent to 41
percent in a Gallup poll.
   Gallup found results from Bush's attacks on Dukakis for vetoing
a Massachusetts law requiring teachers to lead students in the
Pledge of Allegiance. The poll said 68 percent of the registered
voters it interviewed had heard of the Pledge of Allegiance issue,
and by a 2-1 margin they had a less favorable view of Dukakis
because of it.
   The Republican campaign was buffeted with more controversy when
the co-chairman of ``Bulgarians for Bush'' resigned after being
identified in a newspaper report as the former head of a
Nazi-aligned group formed in Bulgaria after World War II. Radi
Slavoff became the sixth person to resign from Bush ethnic
organizations over allegations of anti-Semitic activities.
   Top Republican National Committee official Frederic V. Malek
also resigned Sunday after it was reported that he had conducted a
survey under orders from then-President Nixon of top Bureau of
Labor Statistics officials to see how many of them were Jewish.
   Bush expressed irritation at what he called the lack of ``hard
evidence on various things.'' Although he refused to say whether he
would hire Malek in a Bush administration, the vice president
expressed confidence in him.
   President Reagan, in remarks before Slavoff's departure had been
announced, said he was sure the vice president's campaign hadn't
suffered from any appearance of anti-Semitism. He added he was
certain ``because I know (Bush) and I know the people involved and
there isn't an iota of discrimination in any of them.''
   Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach said Bush's policy on questions of
bigotry is to ``ignore the shame'' and blame the opposition.
   The new polls came on the heels of two surveys providing
snapshots of a close presidential race with eight weeks remaining.
One survey indicated Bush was leading, but by less than the poll's
margin of error. The other indicated Dukakis led, but also by less
than the margin of potential error.
   The image was thus of a race still forming, with the outcome
likely to be heavily influenced by two presidential debates in late
September and mid-October, as well as by an early October
confrontation between Quayle and Democratic vice presidential
candidate Lloyd Bentsen.
   NBC executives said Tuesday the network has reversed its
decision and will carry the first presidential debate live on Sept.
25, interrupting prime-time coverage of the Summer Olympics. The
other major networks said earlier they would cover the debate as it
occurred.
   Both Bush and Dukakis made their way through large battleground
states during the day.
   Dukakis, hoping to bolster his standing as a candidate
knowledgable about foreign policy, offered his view of U.S.-Soviet
relations, criticizing Bush and Quayle and invoking the optimistic
rhetoric of John F. Kennedy.
   ``Civility is not a sign of weakness and sincerity is always
subject to proof,'' he quoted the last president from
Massachusetts. Dukakis said he would challenge Gorbachev to reach
additional arms control accords and to open the Eastern bloc to
more freedom.
   He said Republicans ``are content to leave the intiative on arms
control and regional disputes and the spread of advanced weapons
systems around the world to Mr. Gorbachev. We are not.''
   ``George Bush has been around Washington for a long time, but if
he couldn't stand up to the ayatollah or say `no' to Noriega, how
will he measure up to Gorbachev?'' Dukakis said in a speech to the
Chicago Council on Foreign Relations.
   That was a reference to the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages affair
and U.S. government dealings with Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who is under indictment on drug charges.
   Dukakis later went to a tank factory in Sterling Heights, Mich.,
where he donned a helmet and rode in an M-1 Abrams tank for the
benefit of television cameras. He recalled Bush's statement last
year that Soviet tank workers would be useful in Detroit, and he
said, ``Mr. Bush, I'd rather have mechanics from Michigan.''
   As for Quayle, Dukakis noted that since World War II, three vice
presidents have moved into the Oval Office without being elected
president.
   ``Dan Quayle is no Gerald Ford. He's no Lyndon Johnson. And he
sure ain't Harry Truman,'' the Democratic presidential candidate
said.
   Bush countered on his running mate's behalf: ``Isn't it
interesting that the top of the ticket has to be shooting at the
vice presidential nominee now.''
   Bush made his way from Illinois to Missouri to California during
the day _ states accounting for 82 electoral votes of the 270
needed for victory _ as he stressed the economic recovery of the
Reagan era.
   Scorning Dukakis as the governor from ``Taxachusetts,'' Bush
depicted Dukakis and the Democrats as ``prophets of pessimism.'' He
told the Executives Club of Chicago, ``Americans at every income
level are certifiably better off than they were in 1981. So the
next time somebody tells you that America is declining, tell 'em to
put away the 1980 calendar, this is 1988. America is a rising
nation again.''
   The CBS-Times poll was conducted among 1,043 probably voters
from Thursday through Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points. The Gallup poll was done Friday through
Sunday among 1,003 registered voters and was given a four-point
margin of error.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Seeking Another $550,000 For Wright Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee is seeking another
$550,000 to pay the outside counsel hired by the panel in July to
investigate allegations against House Speaker Jim Wright.
   The committee's contract with the special counsel, Chicago
attorney Richard J. Phelan, provides that he will be paid not more
than $300,000 plus expenses.
   But Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, said
Monday that based on costs for professional services provided by
Phelan's law firm through Aug. 31, the committee will exceed the
$300,000 limit before Congress adjourns next month.
   In a letter to Rep. Frank Annunzio, chairman of the House
Administration Committee, Dixon said the extra $550,000 will ensure
that ``there will not be any financial impediment to the efficient
completion of the preliminary inquiry'' into the allegations
against Wright.
   Dixon said he was prohibited by House rules from disclosing
``the status, progress or projected completion date'' of the Wright
investigation, but he said Phelan's law firm has six attorneys
working on the case full time and other attorneys working part
time, ``all of whom are compensated at an hourly rate of $125.''
   The ethics committee, formally known as the Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct, initially received a $400,000
appropriation for fiscal 1988. After the panel hired Phelan to
conduct the Wright investigation, the House approved an additional
$350,000 for the panel.
   The committee, acting on a complaint filed by Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., voted in June to launch an investigation into six
allegations against Wright, including charges that he used his
office improperly to lobby federal officials and others on matters
in which he had a financial interest.
   The investigation also is focusing on alleged improprieties in
the publication of a book by a campaign contractor for which Wright
received unusually high royalties.
   Wright has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted that he will
be cleared by the investigation.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
on Tuesday welcomed the U.S. decision to pay in full its U.N.
financial arrears, but added that the world body needs more money
and still faces a financial crisis.
   U.N. officials had said that without the U.S. payment, the
organization would have run out of funds in October and would be
forced to use money meant for salaries to finance a peacekeeping
force in the Persian Gulf.
   Perez de Cuellar told reporters as he left U.N. Headquarters,
``It (the U.S. decision) is a very positive development which I
very much welcome and which alleviates our difficulties.
   ``Of course, it is not the end of our financial problems, but it
will alleviate them very much.''
   The United States is the biggest U.N. contributor and is
assessed one-quarter of the annual regular budget of about $800
million. It has withheld funds for years to protest what it called
the organization's political bias and to compel it to institute
budgetary, political and administrative reforms.
   Perez de Cuellar said that because of the payment, President
Reagan would ``feel much more comfortable'' when he addresses the
General Assembly Sept. 26, but added that the president ``is always
welcome.''
   He said he hoped other nations also would pay their arrears to
the 159-member organization. A U.N. statement on July 31 said 73
nations owe money.
   On Tuesday the U.S. government said Reagan authorized immediate
release of $188 million in U.S. dues to the United Nations. He also
directed the State Department to work on a plan for settling all
past debts of $520 million.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the
United Nations ``has reformed its operations to the point'' where
Reagan felt he could act.

<HEAD>Gulf Coast States Brace for Gilbert's Wrath</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Residents along the Texas Gulf Coast on Tuesday braced for the
possible onslaught of Hurricane Gilbert, which ripped through
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands with winds of 140 mph before taking
aim at the Gulf of Mexico.
   In Louisiana, oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from
rigs in the gulf, and residents along the coast awaited word on
whether Gilbert would become the second storm to hit them in a week.
   And on the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil futures prices
moved up a bit Tuesday, driven by a rise in gasoline prices spurred
by concerns about the effects of the hurricane.
   ``Oh man, business is really booming,'' said George Shannon, an
assistant manager at a Wal-Mart store in Galveston, Texas. ``We've
got people all over the place right now buying flashlights,
batteries, lamp oil _ everything.
   ``It's very steady and they're not just coming in getting a
handful of stuff _ it's cartloads of stuff.''
   Gilbert, which could hit the Gulf of Mexico by Thursday, reached
Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength. The
scale lists such a storm as causing catastrophic damage and having
a storm surge of greater than 18 feet.
   ``Everyone's buying plywood,'' Ricky Burge, an assistant manager
at McCoy's Building Center in Galveston, said. ``It's escalating at
this time and it doesn't look like it's going to slow down. Our
business easily has doubled since yesterday.''
   ``Everybody is on standby,'' added Mary Vandewalli, Galveston
County disaster chairman for the Red Cross. ``No matter where it
hits, we're going to get something.''
   Ms. Vandewalli said no shelters would be set up on Galveston
Island and if an evacuation was ordered, people would be sent to
Houston, about 45 miles to the north, and to shelters planned north
of Houston as far away as Conroe, nearly 90 miles inland.
   ``It is not safe to be on the island,'' she said, explaining why
no shelters would be established on Galveston before the storm.
   Elsewhere along the Texas Gulf Coast, emergency preparedness
officials were meeting to plan for the possibility of a storm and
to decide if and when evacuations would be ordered.
   In Louisiana, where last week, Hurricane Florence blew ashore,
oil company officials said they weren't taking any chances with
crews at sea.
   The storm was moving to the northwest about 15 mph.
   ``We began evacuating our offshore drilling personnel yesterday
and we're finishing that up today,'' Shell spokesman Billy
Vehnekamp said. Other companies were following suit.
   Gene Graves, marketing director for Petroleum Helicopters Inc.
in Lafayette, said his company's 18 bases in the Gulf Coast region
were operating at full capacity evacuating the rigs. He estimated
that all the 10,000 or so workers who normally work the gulf would
be evacuated by Wednesday.
   ``I don't think anybody's going to ride this one out, that I'm
sure of,'' he said.
   Vehnekamp said many workers had not yet returned to Gulf rigs
following evacuations before Hurricane Florence hit the southeast
Louisiana Gulf coast last weekend.
   While the oil industry was gearing up for the storm, residents
in areas along the south Louisiana coast were monitoring the
storm's progress.
   ``People have been watching this storm since it was a depression
and they'll be watching it until it comes through,'' said Hayes
Picou, Jr., civil defense director in Cameron, La.
   ``It's too early for us to be doing anything about it,'' he
said. ``Our action will begin tomorrow.
   ``Believe me though, you won't have to tell anyone in Cameron
what to do about it if it comes.''

   Christian militiamen kidnapped the
defense minister Tuesday but freed him three hours later under
pressure from the army. The incident worsened a political crisis
that could reignite Lebanon's civil war.
   Police said the kidnappers, members of the Lebanese Forces
militia, released Adel Osseiran, 83, at 2:40 p.m. after the army
command threatened to storm an apartment building in which he was
being held in east Beirut.
   A police spokesman said Moslem and Christian militiamen traded
automatic rifle fire and rocket-propelled grenades across Beirut's
dividing Green Line after the Shiite Moslem minister's abduction.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with standing
regulations, said at least two gunmen were killed and two wounded
in the fighting, which he described as a ``localized'' incident.
   He said the commander of the Lebanese Forces, Samir Geagea,
received Osseiran after his release and ``apologized to him for the
behavior of the unruly militiamen.''
   ``We denounce such acts in our areas, especially when they
target a personality like Osseiran who is one of heroes of
Lebanon's independence,'' Geagea said in a statement broadcast by
radio stations in east Beirut.
   The silver-haired Osseiran drove from east Beirut to the Alumni
Club of the American University of Beirut in the city's Moslem
sector for lunch after his release.
   The minister, wearing a dark gray suit, told reporters his
captors took him to a ninth-floor apartment in east Beirut's
Ashrafiyeh district.
   ``They prepared coffee for me,'' he said. ``As a matter of fact,
I can say that I enjoyed meeting these people.''
   Osseiran said in English that the kidnappers were members of the
Lebanese Forces from the Christian town of Jezzine in south Lebanon.
   The kidnappers had offered to trade Osseiran for a Christian
parliament deputy, Farid Serhal, who they claimed was kidnapped
Thursday in west Beirut.
   Police said gunmen seized Osseiran in east Beirut at a
checkpoint near the Green Line manned by the Lebanese Forces and
took him to their headquarters.
   An hour later, army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, a Christian,
ordered his 42,000 troops on alert and warned the kidnappers to
release Osseiran ``at once.''
   Aoun has long been at odds with the Lebanese Forces over their
growing dominance of east Beirut and the Christian heartland north
of the capital that has eroded the authority of Lebanon's divided
government.
   The Lebanese Forces claim Serhal, a Maronite Catholic, was
kidnapped by pro-Syrian militiamen of Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party at a checkpoint south of
Beirut as he drove to Jezzine. They said Serhal was being kept at
west Beirut's Bristol hotel ``against his will.''
   Osseiran's abduction heightened tension between Moslems and
Christians during a political deadlock in efforts to elect a new
president.
   Moslem factions and Christians have been fighting a civil war in
Lebanon for 13 years, ravaging the economy and leaving more than
130,000 dead. Syria is the main power broker, maintaining 40,000
troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and south
Beirut.
   In the southern port city of Sidon, fighting broke out Tuesday
between two local Sunni Moslem factions. Police said one person was
killed and seven were wounded.

   President Reagan has authorized the release of
$188 million in U.S. dues payments to the United Nations and has
directed the State Department to work on a plan for settling all
past debts, the White House announced Tuesday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters in a late
afternoon briefing that Reagan told the State Department to work
out ``a multi-year plan'' for paying a grand total of $520 million
in current and late U.S. dues payments to the world body. The U.S.
also has $111.8 million in past due payments separately to the U.N.
peacekeeping fund.
   Fitzwater said the United Nations ``has reformed its operations
to the point'' where Reagan felt he could act.
   ``The president will release $44 million, which was withheld in
fiscal 1988, and $144 million which was withheld in fiscal 1989. He
will request full funding of the United Nations' in Fiscal 1990,
which amounts to approximately $476 million,'' he said.
   The $44 million will be released immediately, Fitzwater said,
while the $144 million that had been earmarked in Fiscal 1989,
beginning Oct. 1, will be set free as funds become available.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told reporters as
he left U.N. headquarters in New York that Reagan's decision ``is a
very positive development which I very much welcome and which
alleviates our difficulties. Of course, it is not the end of our
financial problems, but it will alleviate them very much.''
   In an earlier statement written on his behalf, Perez de Cuellar
said, ``Until the outstanding contributions by all member states
are paid, the organization will continue to operate with inadequate
current income and virtually without reserves.''
   Fitzwater noted that Congress required the president to
determine that the United Nations had made reforms, ``including
cutbacks in the (U.N.) secretariat, the hiring of temporary
employees'' and improved budgeting procedures.
   Fitzwater said Reagan was convinced that the United Nations had
made progress in instituting reforms and that the president noted
the increasing peacekeeping role of the world body in such hot
spots as Afghanistan, Namibia and the Persian Gulf.
   The United Nations, he said, is ``serving important longterm
interests'' of the United States in these troubled regions.
   Fitzwater said Reagan's decision to release a portion of the
funds owed the United Nations immediately ``makes clear that the
United States is ready to meet its obligations.''
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, ``President Reagan's
actions breathe new life into our hopes for world peace'' by
enabling the U.N. to fund peacekeeping operations.
   ``I do, however, deeply regret that this administration has
found it necessary to wait to act until the United Nations is near
the brink of financial disaster and U.S. credibility has been
severely damaged,'' Pell told the Senate.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a House Foreign Affairs Committee member
who has urged increased U.S. leadership on U.N. issues, said, ``The
Reagan decision appears to signal a new era of cooperation rather
than confrontation with the United Nations. The only question is
whether Congress has the vision and the fortitude to reverse course
and follow the president's lead.''
   The United States' regular U.N. dues assessment amounts to a
quarter of the money in the body's budget. And the United States
also is assessed 31 percent of the peacekeeping costs.
   ``We have seen in the last six months some important reforms in
terms of the budget and hiring practices, and so forth, and so that
has been a determining factor,'' Fitzwater said. He also credited
the United Nations with being ``an important factor'' in getting
Soviet troops to withdraw from Afghanistan, and he said there had
been an improvement in the political environment in the world body
where American interests are concerned.
   Reagan is scheduled to visit the United Nations for two days
later this month, and will address the General Assembly on Sept.
26. He also will meet with a number of foreign leaders while in New
York.
   ``During the seven and a half years of this administration, the
president has sought to change the political environment,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``Although the reform is incomplete, the progress is striking,''
he said, saying the United States had been demanding more
accountability from the United Nations for the money it spends.
   The aim, he said, was to ``prod the United Nations to become an
even greater force for peace throughout the world.''
   ``In announcing these decisions, the president called on the
United Nations to continue progress in areas where reform remains
incomplete,'' the spokesman said. ``The president reiterated the
commitment of the U.S. to assist the U.N. in its reform program as
well as in its new peacekeeping efforts.''
   Vernon Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, had
said in late July that the United States hoped to pay $188 million
of its debt to the United ations before the year was out to help
prevent the world body from running out of money at a time of
heightened peacekeeping activities.
   Testifying July 29 before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Walters said that if progress were reached at resolving
such world problems as Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the Cuban
presence in Angola, a transition to independence for Namibia and
the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, the U.N. could face an
annual peacekeeping bill of more than $1.5 billion.
   ``All of these are important to the interests of the United
States and all are likely to involve the United Nations
significantly,'' he said at the time. ``This increase in activity
takes place at a time when the U.N. is facing a very tight cash
situation.''

   Dealing with his first major hurricane
as director of the National Hurricane Center, Bob Sheets wasn't
skipping a beat Tuesday as a multitude of reporters fired questions
at him.
   Sheets, who was acting director during the 1987 Atlantic
hurricane season and was named director in March, spent most of the
morning on the sixth floor of hurricane headquarters beside a large
monitor showing the destructive Hurricane Gilbert sprawled across
much of the western Caribbean.
   His schedule of interviews was timed to the minute. But Sheets,
rosy-cheeked and good-natured, didn't so much as flinch in his seat.
   After all, he noted, ``I've flown into 200 hurricanes ... I
really don't think this is difficult.''
   The transition from former Director Neil Frank, widely known for
his distinctive style and flattop haircut, to Sheets, his dark
blond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with a
gray wool-blend jacket, has been a smooth one.
   ``He knows his job very well and he's a calm personality,''
Vivian Jorge, the center's budget analyst, said of Sheets. On days
with active tropical weather, Ms. Jorge steps in to coordinate
media interviews.
   And interest in Gilbert has been high since it started packing
hurricane-force winds over the weekend and by Tuesday afternoon
became a Category 5 storm with winds of 160 mph and a central
pressure of 26.66 inches.
   A Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength
has winds in excess of 155 mph and pressure less than 27.17 inches
and has the potential for causing catastrophic damage.
   ``This would be considered a `Great Hurricane,' '' said Sheets.
``It's certainly in the top 10 percent as far as intensity, size
and destructive potential.''
   Gilbert was being compared to the hurricane of 1935, which
slammed into the Florida Keys and killed 600 people, and Hurricane
Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969, killing
256. Those are the only Category 5 storms which have made landfall
this century.
   The last major hurricane to make landfall was Elena in 1985,
along the Mississippi, Alabama and Florida Panhandle.
   The major television networks, local stations and newspapers
media were on hand to monitor the hurricane, which could reach the
Gulf of Mexico by Thursday, said Sheets. From there, it's anybody's
guess where it will go, he said.
   ``It's a brand new ball game as far as the continental United
States is concerned,'' said Sheets.
   The center's 33-member crew, including seven hurricane
forecasters and specialists, are keeping a close watch of the
hurricane in a large, open room of blue monitors flickering with
color and non-color graphics.
   And while Sheets might appear to be spend most of his day with
tiny microphones snaking down his back for TV interviews and
fielding questions, he also writes most of the hurricane advisories
issued every three hours and makes hurricane forecasts.
   Dealing with a major hurricane isn't much different from dealing
with smaller ones or tropical storms, Sheets said, adding that
Gilbert has been particularly ``well-behaved.''
   ``It does what we think it's going to do ... You feel a lot more
confident about what you're doing than with weaker systems,'' he
said.

   Freed hostage Rudolf Cordes arrived
home in West Germany Tuesday night, ending a 20-month ordeal at the
hands of Shiite Moslem kidnappers in Lebanon.
   Cordes was accompanied by his wife and German envoys who flew to
Damascus, Syria, after his release late Monday in Beirut.
   In Damascus, the 55-year-old businessman said, ``I feel I'm born
again.''
   A twin-engine West German military jet carrying the couple
arrived at the Cologne-Bonn Airport at 10:20 p.m. (4:20 p.m. EDT)
after a five-hour flight from Damascus.
   The plane taxied to the military area of the Cologne-Bonn
airport, where Cordes was greeted by West German authorities. The
couple then was taken to an undisclosed location in Bonn.
   He is to have a medical examination and is expected to be
debriefed by security officials.
   In Damascus, Cordes hugged his tearful wife, Marlene, and the
couple was escorted by Syrian security officers to the Foreign
Ministry and turned over to West German officials.
   Cordes said in Damascus he nearly despaired during the ordeal
and he saw none of the other 17 foreign hostages missing in
Lebanon, including nine Americans.
   ``There were moments during which I was feeling so terrible. But
now that I am a free man again, that I am joining my family,
everything seems so far away,'' he told a news conference at the
Syrian Foreign Ministry.
   ``I'm rejoicing for being a free man again. I feel I'm born
again. It is as if I have been granted a new life. I am feeling
perfect, and I'm in a very good shape,'' he said in German as he
greeted Bonn's German State Minister for Chancery Affairs Wolfgang
Schaeuble who arrived to escort him home.
   Schaeuble, speaking on West German TV, said Cordes told him his
kidnappers ``treated him humanely, but the conditions were hard, he
was always isolated and was always chained.
   ``He was moved often and was in a continuous state of
uncertainty. He told me he received few letters from his
relatives.''
   Schaeuble said Cordes was not able to identify the kidnappers
because they wore masks in his presence.
   Cordes, Beirut manager for the Hoechst AG pharmaceutical
company, was freed in Beirut at midnight Monday, escorted to
Damascus by Syrian officers and spent the night at a government
guest palace.
   There was no further information about the reported abduction
and escape of an American engineer identified as Kenneth Wells.
   Various reports said Wells was abducted Sunday by gunmen in
eastern Lebanon after he married a Lebanese woman. U.S. officials
in Washingotn said Wells subdued his abductors, reached a Syrian
army checkpoint and was escorted to Damascus where he was turned
over to the U.S. Embassy. They said Wells was employed in Saudi
Arabia for Litton Industries but they did not know his hometown.
   Neither Syrian nor U.S. Embassy officials would comment on the
case Tuesday and Wells could not be located.
   Cordes was kidnapped in Beirut Jan. 17, 1987, by Shiite Lebanese
extremists who were seeking to swap him for an Arab jailed in
Germany on terrorist charges. Mohammed Ali Hamadi, 24, is being
tried in Frankfurt on murder and air piracy charges in the 1985
hijacking a TWA jetliner to Beirut. U.S. Navy diver, Robert Stethem
was killed during the 17-day ordeal.
   Hamadi's brother, Abbas, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in
April after he was convicted of kidnapping Cordes and another
German, Alfred Schmidt, in Beirut in January 1987 to try and
exchange them for Mohammed.
   Schmidt, an engineer, was freed Sept. 7, 1987.
   In Bonn, a West German government spokesman who demanded
anonymity said he knew of no deal with Iran or with the kidnappers
for Cordes' freedom. The government has repeatedly denied it paid a
ransom for Schmidt's release.
   Cordes appeared healthy, smiled all the time and spoke
confidently.
   Asked at the news conference if he had seen any of the other 17
foreign hostages held in Lebanon, he said in English: ``I haven't
seen any hostages. I was alone.''
   Speaking slowly in a trembling voice, Mrs. Cordes, said in
English: `It is wonderful. I couldn't wait for it to happen _ that
our life becomes normal again. It is smashing, so exciting I cannot
believe it is really happening.''
   Cordes' captors, a group calling itself the Holy Warriors for
Freedom, said in a statement Monday that they were freeing him in
response to Iranian and Syrian intervention. The statement did not
elaborate.
   Cordes was reunited with his wife about two hours before he was
turned over to the German officials at the Syrian Foreign Ministry.
   ``She fell into his arms and they kissed each other for a long
time,'' an official who witnessed the reunion said.
   Syurian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said: ``On behalf of
President Hafez Assad I express how glad that he (Cordes) is
released and going back home.''
   Syria maintains about 40,000 troops in east and north Lebanon as
well as Moslem west Beirut. It has been trying to secure the
release of the foreign hostages most of whom are held by Shiite
zealots loyal to Iran.
   It is believed that most of the 17 foreigners still missing in
Lebanon are held by pro-Iranian Shiite kidnappers.
   Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press. Anderson, 40, was kidnapped in Beirut on
March 16, 1985.

   A recount began Tuesday of ballots cast in
Delaware's Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, after the
discovery of a clerical error that incorrectly tallied 2,800 votes.
   The Kent County Board of Elections conducted its recount Tuesday
and recounts were scheduled Wednesday in the state's other two
counties.
   The Kent County board recertified its ballots when the recount
determined nothing had changed.
   ``We have no change in the results. It's over in Kent County,''
said Donna Harrington, administration director of the board of
elections.
   The recounts were requested by both candidates, civic activist
and millionaire Samuel S. Beard and Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo.
   They are seeking their party's nomination to challenge incumbent
Republican William V. Roth Jr., who is seeking a fourth term. Roth
did not have a primary opponent.
   Beard was declared the winner in Saturday's voting, but election
officials discovered early Monday that he had been given 2,800
votes too many.
   Saturday's results showed Beard with 22,418 votes to Woo's
19,624.
   By Monday night, the unofficial statewide tally showed Beard
trailing by 88 votes, with 20,133 votes to Woo's 20,221.
   Those figures included certified results from Kent and Sussex
counties, which had changed slightly from the counties' reports
Saturday night.
   The 2,800-vote mistake occurred in the 23rd representative
district in New Castle County, where about 280 Democrats are
registered. Beard received 28 votes in the district, but the votes
were recorded as 2,828 in the computer at the county's department
of elections, according to Paul T. Hart, administrative director of
the county Department of Elections.
   Woo, 51, a physics professor at the University of Delaware, was
a political newcomer when he was elected lieutenant governor four
years ago. The native of Shanghai, China, had heavy financial
backing from Asian-Americans nationwide.
   Woo heavily outspent Beard, a millionaire who inherited his
wealth.
   Beard, 49, had the backing of party loyalists and labor. He has
served as chairman for job creation commissions under the past four
presidents.

   Three prominent anti-apartheid
activists, detained for more than a year without charge, escaped
from a hospital Tuesday and took refuge at the U.S. Consulate in a
high-rise office building.
   The U.S. Embassy said it had ``high regard'' for the men and
would not force them to leave against their will.
   Two of the three are senior officials of the now-banned United
Democratic Front _ acting publicity secretary Murphy Morobe, a
black, and acting general secretary Mohammed Valli Moosa, an
Indian. The other is Vusi Khanyile, a black who was chairman of the
banned National Education Crisis Committee.
   The U.S. Embassy statement confirmed that the three had taken
refuge at the consulate, on the 11th floor of an office building in
downtown Johannesburg. The building is two miles from the hospital
where they were being treated.
   The main U.S. embassy is in Pretoria.
   Several associates of the escapees later met with U.S.
Ambassador Edward Perkins and they said he assured them the men
would be well cared for.
   The three have asked to meet with their relatives and with
leaders of the anti-apartheid movement, but they have not disclosed
any other requests.
   ``We were in frequent contact with these three men prior to
their detention without charge, and hold them in high regard,'' the
U.S. statement said. ``We will not press them to leave against
their will.''
   The statement said the United States does not offer asylum at
its diplomatic offices. But it said these premises are inviolable
under international law and may not be entered by the host
government without consent. The embassy said it was discussing the
situation with the activists and the South African government.
   Jay Naidoo, an anti-apartheid labor leader, said he and several
colleagues including Max Coleman conferred with Perkins, America's
first black ambassador to South Africa, and they were assured the
escapees' physical needs would be cared for. Coleman said of the
three, ``They're very pleased to be where they are.''
   Brig. Leon Mellet, a spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry,
said the men had escaped from Johannesburg Hospital, where they had
been receiving physiotherapy. No details of the escape were
disclosed.
   Previously, the three had been at Johannesburg's Diepkloof
Prison.
   At the consulate, there was no visible sign of security force
deployments. A private guard stood at the entrance while about two
dozen journalists waited in the hall for several hours before
dispersing.
   Morobe, 32, and Valli Moosa, 31, were detained in July 1987
after going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared June
12, 1986. Khanyile, 37, was detained in December 1986.
   Between the emergency declaration and his detention, Morobe
operated from underground, wearing disguises and showing up
unannounced at newspaper offices.
   As one of the United Democratic Front's most eloquent writers
and speakers, he played a key role in conveying the positions of
the nation's largest anti-apartheid group, at a time when most of
its leaders were in jail or in hiding.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge at
some point during the emergency. The government has not released
comprehensive statistics, but it said recently that 802 people who
had been held at least 30 days were still in custody.
   Many of the detainees were members of organizations affiliated
to the United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition of more than
600 anti-apartheid groups.
   Also detained were virtually all top leaders of the National
Education Crisis Committee, a coalition of parent, teacher and
student groups seeking to give blacks more control over curriculum
and policies in their schools.
   The committee was instrumental in calling off classroom boycotts
that spread nationwide in 1985-86. But when it subsequently
campaigned for ``people's education,'' the government outlawed it.
   The United Democratic Front and the crisis committee were among
17 anti-apartheid organizations banned in February from conducting
any activities. The U.S. government was among many to condemn these
bannings.
   Twice in recent years, activists have taken refuge at diplomatic
missions in South Africa. Six United Democratic Front leaders
stayed at the British Consulate in Durban for several weeks in late
1984 before emerging to face arrest for high treason. The charges
later were withdrawn.
   In September 1987, South Africa agreed to let a Dutchman, Klaus
de Jonge, return to the Netherlands after being holed up at a Dutch
Embassy office in Pretoria for two years.
   De Jonge escaped into the office from police custody after being
arrested for aiding the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement.

   The author of the 15-year-old Supreme
Court decision legalizing abortion in the case of Roe vs. Wade
warned Tuesday that the 1988 term of the court could see the ruling
overturned.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who wrote the 1973 decision
overturning restrictive anti-abortion laws in Texas, indicated the
decision could turn on how faithful new Justice Anthony Kennedy is
to the judicial doctrine of ``stare decisis,'' a policy of courts
not to disturb a settled point of law.
   ``The next question is, `Will Roe vs. Wade go down the drain?'
'' Blackmun, 79, told a class of first-year law students at the
University of Arkansas at Little Rock. ``I think there's a very
distinct possibility that it will _ this term. You can count the
votes.''
   In an apparent reference to Kennedy, Blackmun said: ``One never
knows what a new justice's attitude toward stare decisis is. It's
now 15 years old.''
   No abortion case is scheduled for argument before the court, but
there is speculation in the legal community that the court will
look for one now that the panel includes three appointees of
President Reagan, a noted opponent of abortions.
   Blackmun said his majority opinion in Roe vs. Wade ``has been
criticized from all points of the compass,'' but he wouldn't change
it much if he were to write it today. He decided the case primarily
on the basis of a woman's constitutional right to decide what to do
with her body.
   Blackmun went into no further detail on the possibility of the
decision being overturned.
   Blackmun said the abortion issue, which he has addressed in many
decisions for the court since 1973, is a ``very controversial,
emotional, distressful kind of litigation that has been politicized
in the last few years.''
   He noted the picketing by anti-abortionists around the country
during the presidential campaign, saying: ``I respect their
opinions. I just wish they wouldn't make a single issue out of a
political campaign but this too will pass away, as Mr. Dickens said
a long time ago.''
   Commenting on Blackmun's remarks, Douglas Johnson, legislative
director of the National Right to Life Committee, said: ``It is
highly improper for a Supreme Court justice to interject himself
into a presidential campaign, as Justice Blackmun did.''
   ``Apparently Justice Blackmun himself is on the campaign trail,
trying to energize certain opinion elites to rally in defense of
Roe v. Wade, '' Johnson said from his Washington. ``Apparently
Blackmun recognizes that Roe v. Wade cannot survive merely on its
constitutional merits, so he is calling for cavalry support.''
   Johnson's group claims 3,000 chapters nationwide.
   Blackmun said his abortion opinion has generated more mail than
any other court opinion.
   ``I would say that probably, I get a dozen letters a day, some
very abusive and others, on the other side of the case, are the
most lovely letters I get,'' Blackmun said. ``Just as an example, I
got this cheery little mailgram recently from Decatur, Illinois:
   `Because you satanic Supreme Court justices stand against God,
against justice, against victims, against common sense, against
honesty and everything clean, you will also stand before almighty
God while your blood-soaked hands drip with the blood of innocent
victims. You Supreme Court justices stink with moral rot.'''
   ``Here's one that I rather like,'' he said. ``It came out of
Iola, Kansas. It has little stamps up here, `Go Union.' `May I
please have your autograph. Paragraph. You are responsible for the
deaths of more babies than anyone else in the history of the world
and this is just the beginning of the slaughter of the helpless.
Paragraph. I would certainly appreciate your autograph.' If ever
there was a schizophrenic letter.''
   ``Well, they come in,'' he said of the letters. ``There are some
threatening materials, of course, and a good bit of it is
organized. And a lot of it is tunnel vision.''

   Officials from Jamaica and the Cayman Islands in
Miami readied relief efforts Tuesday as they anxiously awaited
details on the damage wrought by Hurricane Gilbert's passage
through their home islands.
   A U.S. Air Force C-130 plane with international and U.S.
officials aboard went to Jamaica to set up a satellite
communication system to coordinate help in the giant hurricane's
aftermath.
   ``This hurricane from what I can gather is about the worst in
its (Jamaica's) history,'' said Percival R. Todd, Jamaica's deputy
consul-general in Miami. ``It just souped up over the entirety of
Jamaica. There's no place on the island that escaped.''
   Gilbert missed most of Florida, bringing strong winds, rain
squalls and tides 1 to 2 feet above normal to the Florida Keys. But
officials of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, a British colony, were
preparing to hear the worst.
   ``We experienced Hurricane Charlie, so we're accustomed to
savage attacks by tropical storms,'' Todd said. Charlie was the
last major hurricane to strike the island directly, claiming 111
lives in 1951, he said.
   Serious flooding had already swamped the Cayman Islands by
Tuesday afternoon, and officials there expected heavy damage, said
Erina Nichols, a spokeswoman for the Cayman Island Department of
Tourism in Miami.
   Nichols said a relief center for the Caymans was accepting
donations in Miami, and three centers in Dade County were
collecting food, clothing and medical supplies for Jamaicans left
homeless or injured by the hurricane.
   Three Air Jamaica planes full of supplies were ready to fly from
Miami International Airport to Jamaica once an airport there was
confirmed to be safe, said Rupert Williams, commander of the St.
John Ambulance Brigade of Jamaica's Army Medical Corps.
   ``With 150 mph winds lasting 10 hours over Jamaica, it has to be
serious,'' Williams said. The relief effort was being coordinated
by the Jamaican Consulate and Metro-Dade County, Kingston's
``sister city,'' he said.
   Both of Jamaica's major airports were reported to be seriously
damaged, but the Air Force plane was able to land. Aboard was a
team of U.S. State Department disaster specialists, Metro-Dade Fire
Rescue communications experts, Pan-American Health Organization
officials and Jamaica's Miami Consul-General Marie Wray.
   In Broward County, Ingrid Brice said the Jamaican community was
responding to pleas for help with promises of food and clothing,
and volunteers including nurses and doctors.
   ``It's been overwhelming,'' she said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Asks How Bush Would Measure Up to Gorbachev</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS two grafs of Dukakis comments in Washington</NOTE>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis questioned on Tuesday
whether Republican rival George Bush is up to dealing with Soviet
leaders at a time when Soviet economic difficulties offer great
opportunities for the United States.
   ``George Bush has been around Washington for a long time, but if
he couldn't stand up to the ayatollah or say `no' to (Panamanian
Gen. Manuel) Noriega, how will he measure up to Gorbachev?''
Dukakis said.
   ``And if he truly believes that J. Danforth Quayle is qualified
to be one heartbeat away from the presidency, how can we trust his
judgment when America's future is on the line,'' he said.
   Dukakis spoke to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations in
what campaign aides described as a major address outlining his view
of U.S.-Soviet relations. It was part of a week devoted largely to
national security issues by the Democratic presidential nominee,
who is trying to counter the Republicans' depiction of him as soft
on defense.
   Dukakis intensified that effort later at a General Dynamics tank
facility in Sterling Heights, Mich., where he donned a helmet and
rode in a M-1 Abrams tank, the military's top battlefield tank, and
pledged to make strengthening conventional weapons among his top
defense priorities.
   Dukakis stood through the hatch of the tank, his hand resting on
a 7.62 mm machine gun, the tank's turret and cannon spinning, as
the tank was driven at high speed around a grassy field.
   He said the Reagan administration had tried to cut tank
production by one-quarter and asserted that Bush would cut
conventional military spending to finance the Star Wars nuclear
defense program.
   Dukakis planned to address defense and weapons in a speech
Wednesday in Washington. Aides scheduled a stop in Yellowstone
park, to view fire damage, on his way to California Thursday.
   In his Chicago speech, Dukakis said the next president must
``seize the intiative'' in dealing with the Soviets. However, he
said Bush ``has no strategy for testing the limits of what is
called `new thinking' in the Soviet Union.''
   He said the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev has an
economy facing difficulty in providing for its people and that
Gorbachev wants access to Western technology, resources and trade.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev wants to make his country part of the
international economic community,'' Dukakis said. ``What is he
prepared to do in return? Will we allow him to pursue that strategy
unchallenged, or will we have a strategy of our own to rotect
American interests and translate Soviet economic weakness into
improved Soviet behavior in world affairs?''
   Dukakis said he would deal firmly with the Soviets and said
Gorbachev is a Leninist who ``has not abandoned Soviet goals.''
   He said, ``It would be naive to take Gorbachev at his word, but
it would be dangerous to allow his words to go unanswered.''
   Dukakis said he would challenge the Soviets to reduce European
troops, cool regional conflicts, end the spread of nuclear and
chemical weapons and missiles, reject terrorism and allow the
emigration of Jews and other minorities.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev must understand that if there is to be a
fundamental change in the relationship of his country with the
Western world, there must first be a fundamental change in the
balance of forces in central Europe,'' Dukakis said.
   He said he wanted to build on the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces reduction agreement and would challenge Gorbachev to
eliminate a Soviet advantage in tanks and artillery in Europe,
``not just by demobilizing those weapons but by destroying them.''
He also said he would seek to have the Soviets withdraw troops
``back into the Ukraine.''
   Dukakis hammered at his theme that Sen. Quayle, Bush's running
mate, was not up to dealing forcefully with the Soviets. He noted
that three vice presidents since 1945 have been propelled suddenly
to the presidency and that all of them later met as president with
Soviet leaders.
   ``Dan Quayle is no Gerald Ford,'' Dukakis said. ``He's no Lyndon
Johnson. And he sure ain't Harry Truman. Can we stake our future on
the hope that he is a match for Mikhail Gorbachev?''
   Dukakis wrapped up the day in Washington, where in a speech to
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus he said Reagan's appointment of a
Hispanic, Lauro F. Cavazos, to Secretary of Education, was too
little too late.
   ``For some people it's enough to wake up after eight years and
create opportunity for one Hispanic,'' he said. ``I want to stand
with you and create opportunity for 20 million Hispanics.''

<HEAD>Woerner Warns Against Dropping Guard, Sees Larger European Role In
NATO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said on
Tuesday that Western Europeans will have to spend more for defense
to avert a trans-Atlantic ``slanging match'' between the United
States and its allies.
   Woerner, in his first public speech since taking over as top
political official of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said
he welcomed Soviet reforms, but doubted they would ``go far
enough.''
   ``We must take account of realities more than intentions,''
Woerner told the Atlantic Council, a private organization. ``Soviet
defense programs have not slowed down.''
   But he added, ``I see more opportunities than risks ahead.''
   The NATO allies should challenge Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to make more progress toward military stability in
Europe, a global ban on chemical weapons, greater observation of
human rights and deeper economic and scientific cooperation.
   ``The success of the West is the driving force behind the Soviet
leadership's reforms, political as well as economic, but it is
doubtful that they go far enough to overcome the structural
failings of the Soviet system,'' Woerner said.
   ``All this underscores just how wrong, indeed dangerous, it
would be for the alliance to take a leap of faith and to let down
its guard,'' said Woerner who had been the West German defense
minister before taking the alliance post last July 1.
   Woerner said the issue of Europe and Japan assuming a larger
share of the common defense burden had been a central theme in his
first discussions with European leaders, and ``they are committed
to an equitable sharing of responsibility for collective defense,''
he said.
   ``The burden-sharing debate must not be allowed to degenerate
into a numbers game or a trans-Atlantic slanging match,'' he said.
   Woerner said he would work for ``a stronger European pillar
within the alliance'' but added that it was essential for the
United States and Canada to remain committed to the defense of
Europe.
   He said the allies should expand their cooperation outside the
NATO area, an idea that has encountered resistance in Europe.
   ``The Europeans and Canadians do not have the same kind of
superpower responsibilities as the United States, but they do have
a global role,'' Woerner said, citing examples such as providing
aid to the Third World, thwarting Libyan aggression in Chad and
patrolling the Persian Gulf.
   Woerner met for nearly three hours on Tuesday with Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci and discussed the ``full range of NATO
issues,'' a Defense Department spokesman said. He is to meet with
other U.S. officials this week, including President Reagan on
Friday.

   Investigators from the National Transportation
Safety Board talked with the captain of Delta Flight 1141 for the
first time Tuesday afternoon, but gleaned no information that could
pinpoint the cause of the Aug. 31 crash, a board member said.
   ``He does not know why this plane crashed,'' said Lee Dickinson
Jr., who summarized the NTSB's interview with Delta Capt. Larry
Davis in a telephone interview from Washington, D.C.
   Davis, who spent nearly two hours talking with investigators,
had been at Parkland Memorial Hospital since his Boeing 727 crashed
as it took off from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport,
killing 14.
   Davis, one of 94 survivors, was discharged from the hospital
following the NTSB interview. Wearing a back brace and with his
mouth wired shut, he left the hospital with his wife and Delta
officials, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Dickinson said the NTSB hadn't expected the interview with
captain to yield a clue that might solve the puzzling crash,
although investigators had been awaiting permission to talk to
Davis. Davis' physician had barred investigators from interviewing
Davis earlier.
   Davis told investigators that the flight from Jackson, Miss., to
Dallas had been uneventful, and that everything seemed normal again
as he waited on the taxiway to leave for Salt Lake City.
   He recalled shutting down the right engine to save fuel as the
plane waited on the runway, then restarting it, Dickinson said.
   But as the Boeing 727 climbed into the air, Davis heard ``two
loud bangs, or explosions.'' Davis did not recall any warning
beforehand to indicate something was amiss.
   ``He previously experienced compressor stalls, but nothing like
this,'' Dickinson said.
   Davis told investigators he went to full power and simply
``tried to keep the airplane in the air.'' But he doesn't recall
looking down at his instrument panel to see if there were any
warning signals activated.
   Investigators had hoped Davis might be able to tell them if the
plane's wing flaps had been set correctly. But he could only tell
them that he remembered they were approved in a preflight checklist.
   One of the inconsistencies the NTSB had been trying to clear up
has been the fact the cockpit recording indicated the flaps were in
a normal takeoff position for a Boeing 727.
   But wreckage from the plane showed the flaps to be in a
retracted, or improper, position.
   ``He said he does not remember anything in relation to the flap
handle,'' Dickinson said.

   A severe thunderstorm may have triggered a
rock slide that sheared off the front of a Greyhound bus, killing
five people and injuring 14, police said Tuesday.
   The accident occurred late Monday as the driver and 20
passengers drove through a mountainous strip of New Mexico Highway
68 above the rain-swollen Rio Grande, about 50 miles north of Santa
Fe. The bus was en route to El Paso, Texas, from Denver, via
Albuquerque.
   A boulder the size of a car's front end tumbled from the
mountain as the bus approached, striking it broadside and
apparently killing the driver instantly, police said.
   ``It sheared the front end of the bus off,'' said state police
Officer Harold Zuni.
   Witnesses said that after the boulder hit, the bus crashed into
several large rocks but remained upright. The rocks probably
prevented the bus from careening off a steep embankment and
plummeting into the Rio Grande, said the Rev. Andrew McComb, a
Dixon Fire Department volunteer.
   ``All we heard were screams,'' said David Fuller, a Mormon
missionary from Toronto traveling with another missionary, Sean K.
Jones. ``People were thrown out of the bus when we hit these rocks
here.''
   The driver was identified as Gaylon Greer Parks, 39, of Denver.
George Gravley, a spokesman for Greyhound in Dallas, said Parks had
worked for the bus company exactly seven years on Monday.
   The dead were identified as Peedjk Akkandi Sridnaran, 59,
Bombay, India; Esther Grimes, 41, who was believed to be en route
with her family to a new home in Arizona from Denver; a 64-year-old
man from Tokyo, whose name was not being immediately released; and
a woman about 18 years old who carried no identification and is
believed to be a Mexican national.
   Authorities still were trying to identify the toddler belonging
to the unidentified woman who was killed. The child, estimated to
be 18 months to 2 years old, was in the Espanola Hospital in stable
condition, and will be placed in the state's custody if relatives
can't be found, officials said.
   Four of the 14 injured were hospitalized in either stable or
satisfactory condition. Ten people were treated and released.
   Rocks ranging from baseball- to file cabinet-size littered the
road near the bus. The owner of an Espanola radio station said the
area had been hit by a powerful storm just hours before the
accident.
   State Police Officer T.R. Rodella said the rain might have set
off the slide. ``It's been raining off and on here all day,'' he
said.
   Fuller said the driver was going only 45 or 55 mph when the
crash occurred.
   ``I felt an impact,'' said Jones. ``All of a sudden I felt
debris coming at us. A bright light flashed, like sparks and
electricity in the front end of the bus, being destroyed.''
   Jones said he and Fuller, the only passengers not injured,
escaped through windows and helped others out.
   Passenger Cruz Sanchez of Houston said he was sitting about six
seats behind the driver when he heard three crashing sounds he
believed were caused by rocks.
   He said he hit the floor and that people were flying around the
bus. He looked next to him and saw a crying baby trapped beneath
some seats, he said.
   Sanchez said he went to the mother and saw blood on her face. He
was unable to feel a pulse and assumed she was dead, Sanchez said.
He said he and another man freed the child.
   ``Children were crying, people were crying, people were lying
down,'' Sanchez said.

   Shark attacks off Panama City
Beach on Tuesday killed a 38-year-old man and injured a couple from
Georgia, officials said.
   The identity of the victim was being withheld pending
notification of family members, said Florida Marina Patrol Lt. J.
Mike Sweet.
   A McDonough, Ga., couple received minor injuries in the second
attack, which occurred about 45 minutes after the fatal attack at
St. Andrews State Park on the Florida Panhandle.
   Dennis Hadden, 42, and his wife Ann, 41, said they were
returning to shore from a snorkeling trip when the shark struck in
about 4{ feet of water.
   Hadden said the shark bit his wife's arm and released its grip
after he kicked it in the head. The couple said they kept kicking
at the shark until they reached shallow water.
   The Haddens were treated at Bay Medical Center in Panama City
for abrasions and bites on their arms.
   Officials did not know what kind of shark or how many sharks
were involved in the attacks.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A militiaman was acquitted in a
November 1985 slaying which created such public outrage that it led
to the eventual ouster of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, Radio
Soleil said Tuesday.
   A criminal court in Gonaives, 100 miles north of Port-au-Prince,
acquitted Cereste Saint-Phard because of insufficient evidence
after three of six witnesses failed to appear at his trial, the
station said.
   Saint-Phard is an ex-member of the feared Tonton Macoutes, a
private militia of terror that kept the Duvalier family in power
for 29 years.
   He was charged with the Nov. 28, 1985, shooting death of
Jean-Robert Cius, one of three high school students killed by
Macoutes during an anti-government demonstration.
   The killing of Cius, Machenson Michel and Daniel Israel in the
playground of their Immaculate Conception High School in Gonaives
fueled anti-government protests that led to Duvalier's flight to
France on Feb. 7, 1986.
   Haiti was taken over by a military junta led by Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy, who ruled two years. Namphy returned to power in a June 19
coup that ousted President Leslie Manigat, who held the title of
president for only four months.
   Radio Soleil said two of the three witnesses who appeared in
court Monday evening were also former Macoutes under the orders of
Saint-Phard, who was a commander of the Volunteers of National
Security, the formal name of the Tonton Macoutes.

<TEXT>
   Retired Air Force Gen. Lauris Norstad, the
first airman to serve as commander of NATO forces in Western
Europe, is dead at the age of 81.
   Norstad died Monday at Tucson Medical Center, officials at the
hospital said. The cause of death was not released.
   Norstad was a resident of Tubac, 60 miles south of Tucson, since
1963.
   Promoted to brigadier general in 1943, one day after his 36th
birthday, Norstad was involved in planning for the Allied invasion
of North Africa. He personally went ashore with the assault forces,
earning a Silver Star for gallantry.
   Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, then Army chief of staff, appointed
Norstad director of plans and operations after the war. Later, when
Eisenhower was head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he
made Norstad his leading air commander.
   Norstad was promoted to four-star general in 1952. In 1956, he
was appointed supreme commander of Allied forces in Western Europe,
becoming the first airman to head the 15-nation NATO forces.
   Norstad graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point
in 1930. He transferred from the cavalry to the Air Corps in 1931.
   Norstad was named president of Owens-Corning Fiberglas
International after he retired from the military.
   He is survived by his wife, Isabelle Jenkins Norstad, and a
daughter, Kristin Jaffe, of Atlanta.
   A memorial service will be held Friday at the Davis-Monthan Air
Force Base Chapel. Burial will be Sept. 21 at Arlington National
Cemetery.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders on Tuesday denounced
the banning of an anti-government campaign commercial describing
alleged torture by President Augusto Pinochet's secret police.
   Pinochet, meanwhile, ordered the cancellation of a
pro-government television advertisement scheduled for Tuesday to
make up for the banning of the opposition's Monday night spot.
   Pinochet, the 72-year-old army commander who seized power in a
1973 military coup, faces a national referendum Oct. 5 on a
proposed eight more years of rule. According to government-approved
rules for the campaign, his backers and opponents each receive 15
minutes of free television time nightly.
   On Monday night, only the pro-Pinochet spot was aired. The
national television censorship board had objected to a one-minute,
55-second segment of the opposition's advertisement that quoted a
federal judge investigating alleged cases of torture by the secret
police.
   Opposition leaders said Wednesday the board offered to let them
substitute a different segment, but they refused. The board then
decided to bar airing of the entire 15-minute spot.
   ``We don't accept censorship,'' Socialist Ricardo Lagos,
co-leader of a 16-party opposition coalition, told a news
conference Tuesday. ``What happened last night helps to remind us
that we are facing a dictator, and not in a fair electoral battle.''
   Andres Zaldivar, a Christian Democrat also leading the
coalition, said: ``It's a dictator's action.''
   The absence of the opposition ad sparked pot-banging and other
demonstrations of anti-government sentiment around Santiago,
especially in working-class neighborhoods.
   ``Pinochet made a big mistake,'' Zaldivar said. ``In trying to
do us damage, he created a reaction in the people that is
overwhelmingly in our favor.''
   Denis Lustig, executive secretary of the censorship board,
called the National Television Council, said it objected to the
segment because ``it attempted to involve the judicial power in a
political campaign.''
   He said at a news conference that the council had consulted the
Supreme Court, which said it had not authorized the judge's remarks.
   The judge, Rene Garcia, was quoted in the advertisement as
saying he is investigating cases of torture involving more than 50
people arrested by the secret police agency, called the National
Information Center, known by its Spanish acronym, the CNI.
   ``It is duly established that they were arrested by CNI agents,
that they were tortured by CNI agents, in CNI jails,'' Garcia
declares in the segment. The segment was extracted from a
television interview Garcia gave months ago, apparently to a
foreign network. In March, he was told by the Supreme Court to stop
speaking publicly about the cases.
   Lagos said the segment had been broadcast in at least 15 other
countries. ``I ask why they refuse to let Chileans see what a
Chilean judge has said, and which can be seen in the rest of the
world?'' he said.
   Orlando Poblete, the Cabinet-rank government general secretary,
told reporters that on Tuesday night only the opposition's
15-minute time slot would be broadcast. The pro-government spot was
being canceled at Pinochet's order to keep the campaign fair, he
said.
   If a majority vote yes in the plebiscite, Pinochet will remain
president until 1997. If most voters reject him, open elections
will be held in a year and he will hand over power to the winner in
1990.
   The government ordered free television time, from 10:45 p.m. to
11:15 p.m. each weeknight and at mid-day on weekends, starting
Sept. 5 and ending Oct. 1.
   Besides the 15 minutes of free time, paid pro-government
advertisements appear several times daily on all TV channels. The
opposition says it cannot afford paid ads, and doubts that the
channels would allow them.
   Pinochet toppled the elected government of President Salvador
Allende and took power Sept. 11, 1973. Allende, a Marxist, died in
the takeover.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Thugs burned down an empty Roman
Catholic chapel Tuesday several hours after six people claimed
responsibility for a massacre inside another church and threatened
more such attacks.
   The government said it would investigate the attacks, but the
opposition said the military regime instigated them.
   Later Tuesday, unidentified men attacked Radio Cacique _ which
often airs opposition opinions _ slightly injured three employees
and made off with broadcasting equipment, Radio Haiti Inter
reported.
   Radio Haiti Inter said police did not respond to a telephone
call for help from Radio Cacique.
   Opposition figures charged that the military regime of Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy was behind the pre-dawn blaze Tuesday that leveled the
Chapel of Immaculate Conception in Port-au-Prince's Cite Soleil
slum area.
   Reporters who arrived on the scene said they were chased away by
hoodlums.
   The reporters said the hoodlums included one of the six people
who appeared on television Monday night to boast about his
participation in the Sunday massacre at the St. Jean Bosco Roman
Catholic Church.
   At least six people died and 77 were wounded when thugs armed
with machetes and guns burst into St. Jean Bosco during a Mass and
attacked parishioners while police and soldiers stood by outside,
witnesses said.
   The pastor of the St. Jean Bosco church, which was burned after
the slaughter, is Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, a critic of Namphy's
military government and a popular figure among Haiti's
povertry-stricken masses.
   ``The government has committed a genocide on an unarmed people.
It is for the international community to put a stop to it,'' Sylvio
Claude, head of the Christian Democrat Party and one of Haiti's
most popular opposition leaders, said on Radio Metropole on Tuesday.
   ``After all the evidence I have heard on the St. Jean Bosco
affair it is clear that the government organized it,'' Claude said.
   The five men and a woman who appeared on government television
Monday night claimed they were supporters of a rival priest, the
Rev. Arthur Volel of the Chapel of Immaculate Conception.
Opposition leaders said the story was concocted by the government
to cover the real reason for the attack.
   ``The story of bloody rivalry between priests is baseless. It is
a blatant attempt by the government to mislead the public,''
Jean-Jacques Honorat, head of the Haitian Center for the Defense of
Human Liberties, said Tuesday.
   The six who appeared on television made no attempt to hide their
identity and spoke on the government-controlled network without
apparent fear of arrest or reprisals. They also spoke on radio.
   They claimed the violence was related to an internal conflict
within the church and threatened ``a heap of corpses'' at any Mass
celebrated by Aristide.
   Volel and Aristide, members of the Salesian order, are
well-known in Haiti for their work with the urban poor. Volel
denied on private Tele-Haiti Tuesday that there was a rivalry.
   Rev. Jacques Mesidor, superior of the Salesian Order, said on
Radio Soleil: ``We denounce all worn-out trickery and maneuvers
which would lead people to believe that everything which happened
is a result of internal conflict between priests.''
   Rev. Joseph Lafontant, auxiliary bishop of Port-au-Prince,
denounced the attacks. ``In the name of Jesus Christ we say stop
this destruction,'' Lafontant said on Radio Soleil, a church-run
station.
   The government issued a communique late Tuesday promising to
investigate the church attacks and saying it ``sympathizes with the
families of the victims, the Salesian fathers and the Catholic
Church.
   ``The military government regrets the incidents which occurred
on the 11th and 12th of September ... in which the churches of St.
Jean Bosco and Immaculate Conception were burned,'' read the
communique broadcast by radio stations.
   ``The police (are) pursuing the culprits, among whom are the
self-proclaimed perpetrators who appeared on television,'' it said.
   The government issued similar statements following previous mass
killings and political assassinations, but did not follow through
with investigations.
   Namphy returned to power in a June 19 coup that ousted the
4-month-old civilian government of President Leslie Manigat. Namphy
ruled for two years before that as head of a junta after former
President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France on Feb. 7,
1986.
   Aristide, during his sermons, has denounced army atrocities.
Port-au-Prince Mayor Franck Romain said on Radio Metropole on
Monday that Aristide was ``justly punished'' by the massacre. The
priest was shielded by parishoners during the attack Sunday and
escaped.
   ``Those who massacred the worshippers at St. Jean Bosco Church
have been identified as the henchmen of the mayor,'' Honorat said.
   Several witnesses said they recognized city hall employees among
the assailants. Romain denied it.
   When reporters from Radio Metropole and Radio Haiti Inter
visited the charred remains of the Immaculate Conception Chapel
Tuesday, unidentified men at the scene threatened the reporter from
Haiti-Inter, which refused to broadcast the statement by the six
self-confessed killers Monday.
   The Radio Metropole reporter recognized one of the men as a
member of the group of six who boasted about Sunday's massacre.
They made their statement on private Radio Metropole and Tele-Haiti
and government-run Television Nationale.

   Two Air Force F-16 jets crashed in separate accidents Tuesday,
injuring eight people on the ground in South Carolina, while the
pilot of the second craft ejected to safety near a base in Utah,
officials said.
   Shaw Air Force Base spokesman Dave McMahon said a jet crashed
into a stand of trees in Sumter, S.C., and exploded, injuring eight
people on the ground. The pilot, Capt. Ronald J. Garan Jr., 27, of
Yonkers, N.Y., ejected from the plane and was treated at the base
hospital.
   The plane crashed about 3:50 p.m., about one mile south of the
military facility after taking off on a training mission.
   ``The explosion felt like my house was breaking in two,'' said
Marilyn Holley, who ran outside her trailer home when she heard the
crash about 75 yards away. ``It was a fireball and the house behind
it was on fire and people were yelling and screaming and it was
horrible.''
   Officials at first thought the plane hit a house, but later
decided the house caught fire after the plane crashed.
   ``The house didn't appear to be hit,'' Sumter County Fire Chief
Larry Causey said. ``It appeared the plane hit, skipped and went by
the house. Evidently it caught it on fire.''
   William Smith, 59, suffered second- and third-degree burns over
50 percent of his body and was taken to Tuomey Hospital in Sumter
where he was in critical condition, according to McMahon and Susan
Worley, director of business development at the hospital.
   McMahon said Smith was being transferred to Humana Hospital in
Augusta, Ga., Tuesday night.
   Five of the people injured were treated and released, McMahon
said. One person was admitted to the base hospital in stable
condition, another was in good condition at Tuomey Hospital.
   It was not immediately known whether those injured were inside
the house the plane struck.
   In Utah, pilot Capt. Hal K. Bird, 28, of Dallas, ejected safely
when the jet went down 25 miles west of the Hill Air Force Base
near the Great Salt Lake, said spokeswoman Sylvia Le Mons-Liddle.
   The fighter was returning to the base from a routine training
mission.
   Both accidents were being investigated.
   The South Carolina crash was the third involving an Air Force
jet from the base in the past several weeks. Sumter is 40 miles
east of Columbia.
   And in Utah, 27 F-16 crashes with seven fatalities have occured
at the base since the aircraft began to be flown there in January
1979, officials said.

   The problem of radon contamination in the home
appears to be serious enough to warrant testing for the deadly gas
in every residence in the nation, the government's chief
environmental and health agencies say.
   New surveys show particularly high levels of the invisible,
odorless gas in Minnesota, North Dakota and Pennsylvania and the
average home in those states contains radon above the Environmental
Protection Agency's guidelines, according to figures released
Monday at a joint news conference of EPA and the Public Health
Service.
   EPA has estimated radon-caused lung cancers could be killing
20,000 people out of the nation's annual toll of 130,000 lung
cancer deaths.

   A lawyer for Edwin Meese III says the former
attorney general's reputation has been impugned unfairly by a
Government Ethics Office memorandum on Meese that declares that
``simply avoiding criminal conduct is not the mark of public
service.''
   Ethics office director Frank Nebeker said Monday that Meese
failed to meet federal ethics requirements by hanging onto $14,000
in telephone stock and by assisting longtime friend E. Robert
Wallach.
   Nebeker's based his memo on the results of a criminal
investigation completed this summer by independent counsel James
McKay. Although McKay declined to prosecute Meese, he concluded
that Meese probably broke federal conflict-of-interest laws twice
by handling matters affecting the telecommunications industry at
the time he held the phone stock.
   James Rocap, a lawyer for Meese, said in a statement: ``We are
dismayed'' by Nebeker's memo, that Meese's ``integrity and
reputation have been unfairly impugned.''

   All such forecasts in the past have been wrong, noted Malcolm
Tolbert, professor of New Testament interpretation at Southeastern

   Nonetheless, a woman who answered the telephone at the World

prediction, ``88 Reasons The Rapture Will Be In 1988.''
   ``If anyone is left here, they'll be here Wednesday morning,''
said a woman named Lorraine, who refused to give her last name.
   ``The odds of anybody being right are certainly greater than the
odds of winning the recent Florida lottery,'' Tolbert said Monday.
   He noted that such predictions have been made countless times in
the past 2,000 years. ``Nobody's been right.''

   President Reagan has authorized the release of
$188 million in U.S. dues payments to the United Nations and has
directed the State Department to work on a plan for settling all
past debts, the White House announced Tuesday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters in a late
afternoon briefing that Reagan told the State Department to work
out ``a multi-year plan'' for paying a grand total of $520 million
in current and late U.S. dues payments to the world body. The U.S.
also has $111.8 million in past due payments separately to the U.N.
peacekeeping fund.
   Fitzwater said the United Nations ``has reformed its operations
to the point'' where Reagan felt he could act.
   ``The president will release $44 million, which was withheld in
fiscal 1988, and $144 million which was withheld in fiscal 1989. He
will request full funding of the United Nations' in Fiscal 1990,
which amounts to approximately $476 million,'' he said.

its position.
   The vote came after two roll calls in which members first
refused, 46-44, and then agreed, 47-43, to kill a motion to insist
on allowing federal Medicaid payments for abortions in promptly

   In Pennsylvania, where the seriousness of
radon contamination first came to light when a man set off
radiation alarms at a nuclear plant, the state is moving to
regulate companies that test homes for the deadly gas.
   The steps are the outgrowth of nearly four years experience with
radon, an odorless, colorless gas the Environmental Protection
Agency has now linked to 20,000 lung cancer deaths a year
nationwide. The EPA said Monday every home in the country should be
tested for radon because contamination is wider spread than
previously believed.
   Radon is a radioactive gas, trace amounts of which are produced
in the decay of uranium in soil and rocks. The gas is present in
the outdoors normally at about 0.5 percent of the EPA's 4 picocurie
``action level.'' Homes tend to concentrate radon indoors.

   Martin Mull is delighted. He has
found a parking place right in front of the Beverly Hills
restaurant. But, of course _ his car is white.
   Blond-haired, blue-eyed Mull has become a white person by
profession since 1985, due to the success of an innocuous notion he
and fellow white writer Allen Rucker had one day _ ``The History of
White People in America.''
   ``Based on my experiences in Ohio and his in Oklahoma, we
figured we had the Grain Belt pretty well in hand,'' Mull said over
lunch, a salad with a lot of white stuff in it.
   ``We started describing what makes a person white by our
standards. And in this case, the standards were liberal enough they
could include black people; there are certain Caucasians who do not
qualify, as well.''
   A friend at a movie studio told the two they should send the
idea to the cable television people, Mull recalled. ``We said send
what? We don't have anything other than the title. He said, that
doesn't matter.''
   Mull and Rucker produced a two-part Cinemax special, ``Martin
Mull Presents the History of White People in America,'' instructing
viewers on the identification of the white person: habitat, the
Midwest; its clothing, polyester; its food, tuna noodle casseroles
and Cheezits. We were informed the specials were sponsored by the
Institute for White Studies in Zanesville, Ohio, and funded through
a grant from Tastee-Freeze.
   The specials were among the most successful Cinemax had aired,
and they spawned two best-selling books. In 1986, Mull and Rucker
followed up with a four-part series on white religion, crime,
stress and politics.
   The series has since been packaged for home video.
   Mull, the on-camera host of the series, took viewers right into
the lair of the white people, Hawkins Falls, Ohio, and introduced
them to quintessential white couple Hal and Joyce (Fred Willard and
Mary Kay Place) and their offspring, Debbie and Tommy, students at
Dinah Shore High School.
   Now Cinemax presents White People: The Movie. ``Martin Mull in
Portrait of a White Marriage'' premiered on the cable channel last
week and is being played Thursday and on Sept. 17, 20, 23 and 28.
The two-hour movie takes characters from the instructional series
and sets them up for a psycho-cultural crisis _ even as the day of
the Hawkins Falls Founder's Day parade approaches.
   ``White People'' was often viciously satiric. In ``White
Marriage,'' Mull and Rucker have softened up. The laughs are more
mainstream, and the movie is a virtual homage to old-fashioned
values in the face of Hollywood starshine.
   For his part, Mull is now proud father of a 3-year-old daughter.
His wife, Wendy, a composer, wrote the score for ``White Marriage''
and has a bit part _ as an ex-con trying to start a diaper service.
   In the movie, Mull plays the slick host of ``Ask Martin,'' a
``Donahue''-like talk show. When he can't fill a studio in
Pittsburgh, he goes to Hawkins Falls in a pathetic effort to keep
the show afloat, intending to lure starstruck housewives into a
gymnasium to talk about such subjects as ``women who have lost
parts of their bodies through household accidents.''
   He enlists Joyce as his unpaid assistant and falls in love with
her. It seems the big Hollywood star actually longs for the
comforts of a Midwestern home. Meanwhile, Hal becomes jealous and
embarks on an affair with the minister's wife (Julie Payne).
   Michael McKean plays the minister. Harry Shearer, who directed
the movie, plays Mull's producer. Robin Williams makes a cameo
appearance as Bill Loman, a salesman who is rooming at the same
motel as Mull.
   Since completing the movie, Mull has moved on from ``White
People'' to black comedy. He's written a feature film, scheduled to
go before the cameras this fall, about two homeless men in New
York, Eddie Wood and and Mr. Nickles, called ``Wood 'n' Nickles.''
   A new movie for Cinemax, ``Change of Heart,'' will mark his
directing debut. ``I think the word `terror' is overused, but
apt,'' he said. ``Change of Heart'' is a ``somber comedy,'' Mull
said, about a heart transplant that raises the philosophical
questions implied by the figurative meanings of the word ``heart.''

   A sign of the times arrived on the market during
the past couple of weeks, a newsletter dedicated to the thesis that
the way to make money in stocks is to buy undervalued blue chips
and hold them.
   The publishers of ``Blue Chip Values'' say they will stress
fundamental research to find basic values, demonstrable through
such mathematical evidence as price-earnings ratios, yields,
price-to-book value and return on equity.
   ``Now more than ever, good fundamental research is needed to
bring true values to the surface _ not hocus pocus and market
timing trends,'' they say.
   What a contrast to a year ago!
   Back then, the stock market was a crazy carnival, a whirl of
noise, a blur of activity, with excitement kept at a level of
shrill intensity by thrilling performances, fantastic forecasts,
and big winners every other minute.
   What expectation! What entertainment! The spielers and barkers
outdid each other. Each attraction seemed bigger and better than
the other. Three thousand on the Dow? That's nothing, one of them
said. ``We forecast 3,600 points.''
   Then the tent collapsed on the carnival and all the esoteric
theories. The Dow Jones industrial average shriveled to half that
forecast, and the shouting was seen for what it was, a hysteria of
avarice and self-delusion.
   And that produced the market setting for Gerald Perritt and
Cheryl Pierce to add their latest basic-value newsletter to a
stable that already includes ``Investment Horizons,'' ``FundProbe''
and ``The Mutual Fund Letter.''
   Their proposal is incredibly simple: Buy sound common stocks
whose value can be demonstrated. Choose value, and then wait for
the market to come to you.
   This approach to stocks exchews the day-to-day view.
   ``If you need to know daily about your investments then they're
not investments,'' says Perritt, who founded Investment Information
Services to offer investment counsel and materials after years as a
mathematics professor.
   Co-editor Pierce observes that small investors must take the
long-term view rather than attempt to trade. Those who try, she
says, ``are drawn in only when the market is exciting; they're
always in and out at the wrong time.''
   In truth, says Perritt, ``if people knew how easy investing is
they wouuldn't need people like me.'' His theories rely on the
efficiency of the market; that is, that stocks selling above or
below value eventually adjust.
   But, he continues, the hypothesis of most market advice is that
the market isn't efficient. When that assumption is made, he says,
it becomes a different game altogether, one in which frequent and
often exotic advice is rationalized.
   Says Pierce: ``Too few people who buy stock even realize that
they are buying a business. They don't think in such terms; they're
gambling, playing the funny money games.''
   You aren't likely to find hot stocks on the Perritt and Pierce
lists. There is no stock of the week, no telephone hot line. Why
would you need such things when your recommendations are these:
   _Exxon, Florida Progress (electric utility), Philip Morris and
WPL Holdings (electric utility) for above-average yield.
   _Deluxe, a checkprinter, as a special situation.
   _Banc One, in banking, Brunswick in leisure products, James
River in paper products and Pfizer in health care, chosen in part
for their low price-earnings ratios.
   _Aetna Life & Casualty, chosen in part because of its low price
to book value.
   There probably aren't any quick bucks in such stocks, for
subscribers or for Pierce and Perritt.
   Perritt jests that when matched against the offerings of the
hucksters and touts, their theory of buy and hold seems almost
unsaleable. But maybe the market is ready, even at $175 for 17
issues a year.
   As with all investments, be patient. To promote ``Blue Chips
Values,'' the authors offer the first three issues free _ no
obligation to subscribe _ from Investment Information Services, 205
West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Ill. 60606.

   The ``miracle babies'' who survived in the
rubble of collapsed hospitals after the Mexico City earthquake in
1985 now are 3-year-olds, thriving on special attention from
doctors and relatives.
   Evelia Alvarez Gasca, good-humored and playful, likes to sing
and dance. Her favorite is ``Speedy Gonzalez,'' or was, before she
broke the record and pulled the cartridge out of the turntable arm.
   Sarita Valencia Corona, another of the 19 miracle toddlers,
lives with her grandparents in a community with a view of
snow-capped volcanos. She entertains herself with the chickens,
ducks and cows in the small yard or helps her grandparents tend
their crops.
   Jesus Manuel Figueroa or ``Chuchito,'' possibly the biggest
miracle of all, finally is walking and beginning to talk.
   All the babies except Chuchito were from a few hours to a few
days old when the quake struck at 7:19 a.m. Sept. 19, 1985,
bringing the two hospitals where they were born crashing down.
   Government figures put the death toll at about 6,000 people;
unofficial sources put the toll as high as 32,000. Including the
hospitals, more than 400 buildings in the city of 18 million were
destroyed and 5,700 damaged, the government said.
   Chuchito was 21 days old when the quake hit, in an incubator and
on intravenous liquids because of problems at birth. When the
12-story hospital fell, everyone except his mother gave him up for
dead.
   The 19 babies survived amid the rubble from eight hours to
nearly nine days after the quake. Cold and almost unconscious,
Chuchito was found after a week.
   ``Chuchito was just meant to live. No matter what happened he
was going to live,'' said Edward Sawatzky, a Canadian who was in
Mexico City when the quake hit and has been helping victims ever
since.
   ``These babies were under very severe conditions, without food
for a long period, with hypothermia, hypoglycemia,'' said Dr.
Barbara Hernandez, who cares for 14 of them.
   They had infected wounds and were dehydrated, but only one
suffered lasting injuries, doctors say, a boy who suffered a
deformed hip joint because of infection. The boy, Jesus Francisco,
learned to walk four months ago.
   Hernandez and other doctors say the other babies are normal
except for one who was born without legs from the knees down and
Chuchito, whose slowness in walking and talking they say are due to
his birth problems.
   Evelia will have to have surgery on her tear ducts and needs
orthopedic shoes, her aunt said.
   About half the children, including Evelia and Sarita, lost their
mothers, but all are in what social workers consider to be good
family situations.
   In one sense the babies are lucky. They were from poor families
and have had more medical attention and stimulation than they would
have had otherwise. And they caught the hearts of everyone.
   ``The ones I worry about are the secondary victims'' who aren't
in the limelight, said Janet Rogozinski, head of U.S. Private and
Voluntary Organizations here. The agency channels private donations
from the United States to earthquake victims.
   Among them are the six older sisters of Lucia, another of the
babies. While Lucia is cared for by a doting aunt, her sisters, now
5 to 12 years old, were seriously neglected even though they were
living in the same household.
   With a donation from the United States, they are now living and
going to school in a convent during the week. Donations also are
supposed to help build a home for Lucia's father and sisters on a
lot left by his wife, although neighbors now are claiming the land.
   Also less fortunate are a boy and his four sisters, 3 to 12, who
lost their parents in the quake and are now in an orphanage.
   An American couple was approved as adoptive parents, but sources
familiar with the case say an uncle of the child has blocked the
process. He wants legal custody but does not want the children to
live with him and denies accusations that he is interested only in
a trust fund that benefits the children, the sources said.
   Poverty is a besetting problem for the earthquake babies'
families.
   Sarita's father, who visits often, lives and sells tamales in an
area of Mexico City with no street lighting or other public
services and dirt streets that are barely passable by car even when
dry.
   Evelia's aunt, uncle and father sell used clothing, costume
jewelry and other items in a market to support themselves and their
five children.
   Evelia's uncle, Reynaldo Becerra Aguillon, said sales were down
and he can't raise his own prices to make up for the higher prices
they have to pay for food and other items.
   ``We manage to make enough to cover the expenses,'' he said.
``Not very well, but more or less.''

<HEAD>In Chilean Farm Country, Political Question Is Tinged by Fear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FERNANDO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the country's agricultural
heartland, old ingrained fears tinge the debate over the referendum
next month on Gen. Augusto Pinochet's presidency.
   For prosperous landowners, frightening memories of farm seizures
by leftist peasants in the early 1970s has helped push them solidly
into the pro-Pinochet camp.
   ``This is the fear we have, of returning to the past,'' said
Francisco Olea, owner of a 100-acre spread here in the country's
fertile Central Valley.
   But for struggling farm workers, the prospect of reprisal by
their bosses or local officials is keeping many from openly voicing
dissent. Some say resentment with Pinochet's authoritarian rule,
and with a hand-to-mouth existence, will find expression in the
ballot box.
   ``At least before there was work, and the worker had the right
to express his opinion,'' said laborer Ramon Arias, as he painted a
tractor by the roadside. Two farmhands with him made similar
comments, but refused to give their names.
   Chileans will decide Oct. 5 in a yes or no ballot on a new term
for Pinochet, the right-wing army commander who seized power in a
bloody 1973 coup and has already ruled longer than any previous
president.
   If a majority vote for him, he will remain as president until
1997, but the military junta that he has headed as the governing
body since 1973 will be disbanded. If he loses, open elections will
be held in a year and he must hand over power in 1990, when a new
Congress, two-thirds elected and one-third appointed, will go into
place.
   Farmowner Olea and others like him have benefited from an
export-oriented, free-market economic program carried out by
Pinochet's administration. Foreign sales of grapes and other fruit,
much of it grown in the Central Valley, have been booming. With
government credits and technological assistance, many farm owners
are expanding production and making solid profits.
   But they have not forgotten the chaotic, radical reform programs
launched by President Salvador Allende, a self-declared Marxist
elected in 1970 and toppled in the coup led by Pinochet three years
later.
   Olea's home and land were illegally seized by peasants. He
negotiated with them so he could live in his house, which also had
been taken over, while they worked his land as they liked.
   ``We lived through a savage lack of order,'' said Luis Aullet,
who is partner with his brother Cesar in a 70-acre farm. ``There
was no respect for your home, your land.''
   Cesar Aullet said the Allende government sent ``experts'' with
no knowledge of agriculture to supervise land reform programs.
``What we fear is (that kind of) ignorance,'' he said.
   The landowners said that, with the production boom, conditions
for farm workers were improving significantly.
   ``Manpower is becoming scarce, and there's competition in
salaries to attract workers,'' Cesar Aullet said. ``Anyone who
wants work can find it.''
   The Aullets said that at the height of the harvesting season,
workers could not be found for less than 1,000 pesos, about twice
the minimum legal daily wage and equivalent to about $4.
   Their positive vision of rural Chile is shared by Pinochet's
campaign strategists, who predict overwhelming voter support from
the heartland.
   Opposition leaders contend that the countryside's poor majority
are suffering economically and are eager for a change but won't say
so publicly because they fear losing their jobs or government
benefits, such as pensions and housing subsidies.
   The opposition's political campaign is aimed at overcoming such
fears, while recognizing them as legitimate. One prominent campaign
slogan in the countryside is ``Say yes, but vote no.''
   Several farm workers said harvesting jobs paid an average 700
pesos, or less than $3 a day, and lasted only a few months a year.
``You can't live on that,'' Arias said.
   Jorge Contreras, who sells bread from the back of his small,
battered truck in the countryside around San Fernando, said most of
his customers opposed Pinochet's continued rule.
   ``I travel 50 kilometers (30 miles) a day, and I can tell you
there are a lot more people for the `no' vote than the `yes'
vote,'' he said.
   But he added: ``Lots of people may vote `yes' because they're
afraid.'' He said that in one remote town on his bread route,
Tinguiririca Alto, ``people are telling each other that if you vote
`no,' you'll be arrested.''
   The government has said the vote will be secret, and the
opposition has publicized its plans to have representatives at each
polling place to prevent intimidation.

   Cruz Ayala Marroquin has spent his
working life for the past quarter century standing knee deep in the
Las Canas river shoveling sand onto the bank.
   He is an ``arenero,'' a sand-digger, and ekes out a meager
existence supplying sand for construction sites in San Salvador,
the capital 10 miles to the south.
   Manuel de Jesus spends his time pulling an iron-wheeled wagon
loaded with 800 pounds of bananas from the eastern bus terminal to
San Salvador's central market.
   Neither has anything to show for his work except the sinewy
muscle of his arms and back. What they earn with their toil is not
so much a living as another day's survival.
   The hard life is harder for the poor in El Salvador.
   Though there is no official parameter such as a ``poverty
line,'' it is clear that the great majority of El Salvador's 5.5
million people are poor.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development says 27 percent of
children under 5 are malnourished. Infant mortality is 91 per 1,000
live births, the highest rate in Central America.
   Half the population lacks safe drinking water, and the leading
cause of death is intestinal infection, according to the Ministry
of Health. Only four out of 10 people can read and write.
   ``With this you make enough to eat, that's it,'' says the
grizzled Ayala, 55, pausing to lean on his shovel. He and his wife
reared seven children in a two-room adobe house. Three of the six
boys became sand-diggers.
   Ayala rises every day, including Sunday, at 3 a.m. so as to be
at the river by 4. The first trucks arrive at dawn, by which time
Ayala has shoveled a ton of sand.
   On a good day he'll dig three or four one-ton truckloads and
make 15 to 20 colones ($3 to $4). With that his wife will buy rice,
beans, tortillas, perhaps a few eggs and some cheese _ enough for
the couple and their one remaining dependent child.
   ``You can't save a colon,'' he says. ``The few cents you set
aside go up in smoke with an illness, something like that.''
   He says he feels strong and plans on working at least five more
years. He'll depend on help from his sons when he can no longer
work.
   Ramon Aristedes Najarro, who digs about 50 yards downriver from
Ayala, is 48 years old and feels his strength draining. He doesn't
even want to think about how he'll get by when his back gives out.
   ``I'll just have to find something else. Selling newspapers, or
maybe I'll have to beg.''
   At the San Salvador's central market, Manuel de Jesus takes a
break with three other ``carretoneros,'' or cart-pullers, seated on
their sturdy wagons. A sweet, slightly nauseating odor wafts across
the narrow street from a pile of rotten or mashed bananas.
   A middle-aged woman searches through the pile for still edible
fruit.
   The cart-pullers, like the sand-diggers, make about $3 on an
average day. De Jesus, 28, and Granadeno Perez, 29, sleep in a
nearby flophouse that charges $2 a night for a piece of cardboard
on the floor and water for bathing. That leaves them a dollar for
food _ and for booze.
   ``Sometimes we go without eating to buy guaro,'' says Perez,
already in a semi-stupor from the cane liquor by 10 a.m. All four
cart-pullers readily admitted they try to maintain a constant
alcoholic haze.
   Several times a day they come up with the five colones to buy a
half-liter of Muneco, the cheapest guaro.
   ``It's very hard, this life,'' said de Jesus. ``There's no
future in it. It damages your body. The only thing you're left with
are the knocks.'' He motioned to Perez's bandaged hand, sprained
from the strain of hauling.
   Asked his feelings about leftist guerrillas who say they are
fighting for the poor, Ayala said: ``I understand nothing of
politics. But some say they (the guerrillas) would make this
another Nicaragua. I don't want that.''
   None of the sand-diggers or cart-pullers interviewed could read
and none has ever voted. Democracy, which returned to El Salvador
in 1982 after decades of military rule, means little to them.
   ``Democracy has done nothing,'' says Najarro. ``It hasn't
created jobs. You look out for yourself and get by as best you
can.''
   ``I doubt the country can progress,'' says Ayala. ``I don't have
faith.''

   Melody Baldwin poisoned her first child. Her
second is on the way. Now the judge who controls her fate has
proposed an unorthodox solution to her troubled life _
sterilization.
   The proposal has thrust the expectant mother into a thorny legal
debate over crime and punishment and whether the courts are playing
God or protecting society.
   An outcry arose after Judge Roy Jones suggested he might be more
lenient if Miss Baldwin were sterilized before he sentences her for
feeding her 4-year-old son, Joshua, fatal doses of psychiatric
drugs prescribed for her.
   ``She is a person who no longer needs to ever have any
children,'' Jones said. If she becomes a mother again, he warned,
``the possibility is there for the same thing to happen.''
   Miss Baldwin, due to give birth late this month, has signed a
consent form agreeing to sterilization, her attorney says. But her
prospect of trading motherhood for a reduced prison term has
outraged civil libertarians, feminists and the county prosecutor
who say Jones' proposal would deny her a most fundamental right.
   ``I don't think it's appropriate for the court deciding who
should have a child and who shouldn't,'' said Richard Waples, legal
director of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union. ``You're authorizing
a decision on reproductive capabilities that is dangerously close
to eugenics (a form of selective breeding). That's something that
is foreign to our system and beliefs about the sanctity of human
life and the limited power of the state.''
   ``It reminds me of the Islamic punishment of cutting off a hand
for theft,'' said lawyer Pequita Buis, state legislative
coordinator for the National Organization for Women. ``We don't
engage in physical mutilation for punishment in this country.''
   Jones insists his proposal isn't punitive or inconsistent with
NOW tenets.
   ``They are the biggest advocates I am aware of how a woman
should have the right to control her own body,'' he said. ``All I
suggested to Miss Baldwin is that she in fact think about that _ do
something to control her own body.''
   Miss Baldwin, who has told her attorney she will surrender her
baby for adoption, pleaded guilty in June to neglect of a dependent
_ giving her son drugs _ after the state agreed to drop murder
charges.
   Shortly afterwards, Miss Baldwin, then six months' pregnant, was
hospitalized for weight loss. She's since been moved to a
psychiatric ward, awaiting the prospect of six to 20 years in
prison.
   Jones says if Miss Baldwin rejects sterilization, it won't hurt
her in court; if she agrees, he says, it could ease mental pressure
and be a mitigating factor.
   Her attorney, Michael Donahoe, says he doesn't think his client
should become a mother again because she ``doesn't seem to be
mentally, financially or legally in a position to raise a child in
a responsible way.''
   But Donahoe says he fears that if she is sterilized, ``her
already low self-esteem would be reduced almost to nothing.''
   The ethical and legal questions raised in this case have
surfaced elsewhere where court rulings have touched on the most
intimate aspects of life.
   This month, an Arizona judge reversed her order requiring an
18-year-old mother to practice birth control throughout her
childbearing years after she left two infant sons alone in a
sweltering apartment for three days. The judge said the order was
unenforceable because of the fallibility of birth control; the
woman is pregnant again.
   In 1985, three convicted rapists in South Carolina were
resentenced after the state Supreme Court said a judge's decision
to let them choose castration over prison violated safeguards
against cruel and unusual punishment.
   And in Michigan in 1986, the state Supreme Court upheld a
5-to-15-year prison term imposed on Upjohn Co. heir Roger Gauntlett
in place of the ``chemical castration'' originally levied after he
pleaded no contest to raping a 14-year-old stepdaughter.

<HEAD>INDIANAPOLIS: 14-year-old stepdaughter.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The chemical castration, part of a sentence that included a year
in prison and four years' probation, involved taking Depo-Provera,
an experimental Upjohn drug used to reduce male sex drive.
   Such debates aren't new. In 1942, the U.S. Supreme Court struck
down an Oklahoma law allowing sterilization of certain groups of
felons, noting that ``marriage and procreation are fundamental to
the very existence and survival of the race. ... In evil or
reckless hands it can cause races or types which are inimical to
the dominant group to wither and disappear.''
   And similar language is being used today.
   ``I don't understand where any court in this country is
qualified to tell people ... who's fit to breed and who isn't,''
said Garrett Simpson, an Arizona public defender representing the
woman originally sentenced to birth control.
   ``It doesn't take a huge jump from Who can have children? to
Whose life is meaningful and whose isn't?'' he said. ``These are
questions the law isn't capable of answering.''
   But others argue alternative sentences can be effective.
   ``We have a very, very destructive system,'' said Daniel Polsby,
a Northwestern University law professor. ``We send too many people
down the river. We've got to be more creative. (If there are)
people that you can handle in some other way, handle them in some
other way.''
   And although Polsby agreed with the need to protect rights, he
said, ``20 years of close confinement in a penitentiary is as
serious a deprivation of civil liberties as you can imagine, short
of being killed.''
   That's a good possibility for Miss Baldwin, a 29-year-old
unemployed waitress with a history of emotional problems and
self-abuse.
   Last summer, while awaiting trial, Miss Baldwin injected urine
in her breasts, a bizarre act Donahoe said stemmed from frustration
and depression. Many years ago, he said, she nicked her wrists with
a razor.
   Miss Baldwin's behavior was scrutinized shortly after Joshua's
birth when medical workers noticed the baby's repeated coughing,
vomiting and breathing difficulties occurred only when his mother
was alone with him.
   Donahoe said the boy was placed in a foster home but was
returned to his mother several weeks later when suspicions of abuse
could not be proven.
   On Aug. 28, 1986, Joshua was hospitalized with a cough. Five
days later, after improving steadily, he suddenly grew lethargic;
he was in a coma by the next morning. On Sept. 5, life support was
turned off.
   An autopsy found he had died from drugs likely given within 24
hours of cardiac arrest, which caused his brain death. The drugs,
specifically an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic, were
dispensed to his mother.
   Originally, prosecutors claimed Miss Baldwin turned off an alarm
on a monitor that would have alerted nurses to Joshua's sudden
change in brain activity. She denied the allegation, and it was
dropped from the final charges before the plea agreement.
   The accusation was mirrored this summer when a doctor said Miss
Baldwin disconnected a tube providing nourishment to her and her
fetus.
   Donahoe said his client was having trouble keeping food down,
but attorney Timothy Bookwalter, representing the fetus, said Miss
Baldwin engaged in self-induced vomiting ``to create a medical
calamity involving the unborn child.''
   ``She's killed one (child) purposely,'' he said. ``She has tried
to cause a premature birth of a second one. Anybody who doesn't
think she was trying ... to harm the two would have to be crazy.''
   Donahoe disagrees. ``I really believe, more than anyone on this
planet, she wants to bring a healthy baby into this world,'' he
said. ``There might be a connection between that need ... and what
she's been convicted of.''
   Whatever she chooses, Donahoe says her future is bleak.
   The idea of sterilization ``makes her feel like she's being
treated like an animal,'' he said, and if she's imprisoned, ``being
kept in a cage is being kept like an animal. Her dilemma is how
she's going to be treated like an animal.''

   Mars' closest approach to Earth in 17
years _ and the best Northern Hemisphere view of the red planet in
113 years _ has backyard astronomers peering excitedly through
telescopes.
   A network of 500 mostly amateur astronomers in 33 countries has
been organized for Mars Watch '88 by the International Mars Patrol
and the Planetary Society, which has dubbed the occasion ``a close
encounter of the red kind.''
   ``Unless you're on the North Pole or South Pole, you'll get good
views of Mars'' through telescopes until mid-December, said Dr.
Donald Parker, a Coral Gables, Fla., anesthesiologist and ``Mars
recorder'' for the patrol, which is part of the Association of
Lunar and Planetary Observers.
   ``You can see the surface, the clouds and the polar ice caps and
really realize it is a whole world,'' Parker said. ``Occasionally
we've seen shadows cast by big dust storms. It's really neat.''
   ``For observers in the Northern Hemisphere, Mars is more
favorably positioned than at any time from 1875 through 2025''
because it's not only closer, but farther north in the sky than
usual, said Jeff Beish, an Eastern Airlines flight simulator
technician in Miami who also collects reports for the Mars Patrol.
   Mars watchers already have provided 1,200 reports, photographs
and sketches to Parker and Beish, who send key findings to Jet
Propulsion Laboratory astronomer Stephen Edberg, who coordinates
Mars Watch '88 during his spare time.
   The observations mean ``when we send cosmonauts or astronauts to
Mars, we're going to have a better understanding of the planet,''
said Edberg. ``Mountaineers use telescopes to look at routes before
they try them. The same goes for preparing for manned exploration
of a planet.''
   The Pasadena-based Planetary Society is a nonprofit group
lobbying for manned exploration of Mars.
   At 8:18 p.m. PDT on Sept. 21, Earth and Mars will be 36.54
million miles apart _ the closest since they were 34.92 million
miles apart in August 1971, said telescope demonstrator Anthony
Cook, of Los Angeles' Griffith Observatory.
   Mars and Earth are close now because on Aug. 12 Mars was at
perihelion _ its closest approach to the sun _ while at 8:25 p.m.
PDT Sept. 27 it will reach opposition, meaning it is on the
opposite side of Earth from the sun. They won't be so close again
until Aug. 27, 2003, when they get within 34.65 million miles. They
sometimes are as far as 248 million miles apart, and as far as 63
million miles apart during non-perihelion oppositions.
   Oppositions occur about every 26 months. But favorable, or
close, oppositions, occur every 15 to 17 years. Even then,
excellent views usually are available only to Southern Hemisphere
residents.
   To the naked eye or through binoculars, Mars now is easily
visible all night as a reddish-orange spark, the evening sky's
second brightest object after the moon.
   For Northern Hemisphere viewers, Mars appears low in the
east-southeast after dark. At midnight, it is halfway between the
southern horizon and a point directly overhead. Before dawn, it is
low in the west-southwest. For Southern Hemisphere observers, Mars
is in the east-northeast in the evening, appears halfway between
the northern horizon and a point directly overhead at midnight,
then is visible before dawn low in the west-northwest.
   People who want detailed views can attend telescope sessions
sponsored by the Planetary Society, planetariums, colleges, science
centers and astronomy clubs.
   The smallest telescopes capable of providing detailed views of
Mars are 3-inch refractors or 4-inch reflectors, each with
150-power magnification, Cook said. Because time on big telescopes
is dominated by observations of distant stars and galaxies, ``most
of the round-the-clock watch of the planet is kept by amateur
astronomers.''
   Parker, 49, has spent nights outdoors to watch Mars for 40
years. ``I have very bad arthritis and get mosquito bites, but I
look at this damn planet and it makes my whole day,'' he said. ``I
hope in my lifetime men will get to Mars. It's always been a dream
of mine.''

<HEAD>New Pillsbury Chief Expects Flat First Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co. expects its first quarter
operating income to be flat, due to continued sluggish sales by its
Burger King fast-food restaurant chain, the company's chairman said
Tuesday.
   Philip L. Smith, in his first major public appearance as the
food and restaurant company's new chairman, told Pillsbury's annual
meeting that comparable Burger King restaurant sales were off 2
percent in the first quarter of fiscal 1989 from the same period
last year.
   The decline extended a trend that contributed to a major
restructuring in the previous year, which sharply reduced
Pillsbury's net earnings. Pillsbury had net earnings in fiscal 1988
of $69.3 million, or 81 cents a share, compared with $181.9
million, or $2.10 a share in fiscal 1987.
   Smith said that for the first quarter of fiscal 1989 operating
results should be ``virtually flat'' although net income will be up
about 25 percent because of a one-time benefit in deferred taxes.
   ``Foods will have an excellent first quarter, but restaurants,
as I indicated, will be down because of the investment expenses we
are incurring and because of continued sluggish sales at Burger
King,'' Smith said.
   Besides spending $30 million this year to upgrade training and
add new managerial staff at Burger King, Pillsbury will begin a
$150 million capital improvement plan to add 60 new company stores
and upgrade existing stores, Smith said.
   ``The long-term profit performance for the whole company makes
it essential that we succeed, and there is no reason why we
cannot,'' Smith said. ``I will be present in Miami at our Burger
King headquarters frequently to provide encouragement and to assist
in making the right judgments with a clear sense of urgency.''
   Smith said he expects profit growth in the foods division during
the coming fiscal years and an overall ``solid financial gain''
despite the expenses incurred to improve restaurant sales.
   He said the company's S&A Restaurant Corp., which operates the
full-service chains of Steak and Ale and Bennigan's, experienced
its first upturn in average restaurant sales in four years during
the first quarter of this year.
   In last year's restructuring, the subsidiary dropped two small
chains, got out of the hotel food service business and closed 23
underperforming Steak and Ale restaurants.

<HEAD>Hugh Hefner Isn't Running for Re-Election to Playboy Board</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hugh Hefner, whose name is synonymous with
Playboy magazine, has decided to step down as chairman and chief
executive officer of the business empire he launched with a $600
investment.
   Hefner, 62, issued a statement Monday that he would not run for
re-election to the board of directors of Playboy Enterprises Inc.,
the magazine's parent company. The directors election is scheduled
following Playboy's shareholders' meeting Nov. 10.
   Hefner's daughter Christie, who has run the day-to-day
operations of the company since 1982, is expected to be elected to
the posts now held by her father, the statement said.
   The company also revealed it would receive a seven-figure
advance from Bantam Books, Inc., which is publishing Hefner's
autobiography.
   Hefner, who mortgaged his furniture and invested $600 of his own
to publish the first issue of Playboy in December 1953, called the
change ``just another evolutionary step consistent with my own
personal plans.''
   Christie Hefner said in a statement that she hopes to expand
Playboy's licensing, television and video businesses.
   ``The geographic reach of the company also will continue to be
expanded,'' she said, ``with new markets such as India and Eastern
Bloc countries opening up for Playboy-licensed products, and
foreign distribution of home video and television programs
growing.''
   Ms. Hefner, 35, who over the past six years returned the company
to profitability by selling off its sour businesses, now is
president, chief operating officer and vice chairwoman of Playboy
Enterprises.
   After she becomes Playboy's top board executive, the company's
founder will remain the major stockholder, with the titles of
chairman emeritus and editor-in-chief of Playboy magazine, the
company's statement said.
   ``Christie has had my full support since she took responsibility
for the day-to-day operations of the company in April of 1982,''
Hefner said in a statement.
   Under Ms. Hefner's business direction, Playboy Enterprises
closed the last of its U.S. key clubs and shed its interests in
movie theaters, modeling and book and record clubs. Playboy
Enterprises made a $2.6 million profit in 1988.
   Dan Lee, an analyst with Drexel Burnahm Lambert Inc. in New
York, speculated Hefner may have stepped down to spend less time on
business and more on his fiancee, Kimberley Conrad, 26, Playboy's
Playmate of the Month for January.
   ``In a business sense, Christie Hefner has largely been running
the company for the past several years. But he owns about 80
percent of Playboy's stock, so there won't be any dramatic
changes,'' Lee said.
   ``I think in terms of the company overall _ it is a changing of
the guard, a sort of passing the reins along,'' said Playboy
spokeswoman Robyn Radomski.
   ``In terms of where the company is now, it's a logical step.
...But Hef is still going to be editor-in-chief of the magazine and
be involved in major strategic decisions.''

<HEAD>Maxwell Pondering Next Move After Macmillan Agrees to Other Offer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Macmillan Inc.'s agreement to a $2.36 billion
takeover by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., doesn't rule out a
higher offer from British publisher Robert Maxwell, but some
securities analysts believe his effort to acquire the U.S.
publishing-and-information giant has been doomed.
   ``Being a rational person, I would think at this point he would
withdraw his offer,'' Bert Boksen, an investment strategist at
Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., said Monday
after Macmillan's deal with Kohlberg was announced. ``But Maxwell
is known to be unpredictable.''
   Kohlberg Kravis' $85-a-share cash and securities acquisition, if
successful, would conclude Macmillan's struggle to thwart unwelcome
takeover attempts by Maxwell and Texas investor Robert Bass.
   David Bonderman, an official at the Bass group's headquarters in
Fort Worth, Texas, declined to comment. Andrew Turner, a spokesman
for Maxwell at his Oxford, England offices, said, ``We've received
this report and are studying it.''
   Wall Street reacted skeptically to whether a higher offer would
emerge. Macmillan stock rose 87{ cents a share to $84.75 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading on Monday.
   Analysts were divided on Maxwell's next move. While some thought
he would abandon his pursuit of the company, others said he could
increase the bid, because his $84-a-share offer was so close to
Kohlberg's $85.
   ``I would not be surprised if we would see more from Maxwell,''
said Bruce Thorp, who follows the publishing industry for Provident
National Bank in Philadelphia. ``You might be able to make the
argument that his all-cash of $84 is more attractive. If so, he's
still in contention.''
   But J. Kendrick Noble, a Macmillan analyst at PaineWebber Group
Inc. in New York, said: ``I think the KKR-Macmillan bid is probably
the last bid. Should Maxwell come back a buck higher, there's no
assurance KKR and Macmillan management might not stretch their
bid.''
   Macmillan's deal with Kohlberg marks another multibillion-dollar
acquisition for the investment firm, a specialist in leveraged
buyouts.
   These acquisitions _ in which a company is bought largely with
borrowed funds that are repaid through its earnings, cash flow or
asset sales _ remain a frenetic area of corporate takeover
activity. Kohlberg is one of the leaders, having played crucial
roles in four of the biggest leveraged buyouts of the past three
years.
   Securities analysts said the Macmillan acquisition also might
radically alter the structure of the company, a leading publisher
of educational materials with other businesses ranging from
direct-mail marketing to the Berlitz chain of language training
schools.
   Some speculated that Kohlberg Kravis would sell either
Macmillan's publishing or information division to help finance the
acquisition. Others said Gump's, a Macmillan-owned chain of
high-quality retail stores and a mail-order business, might be sold.
   Neither Kohlberg nor Macmillan officials would speculate on the
possible sale of any Macmillan units.
   Under terms of the agreement, a Kolhberg subsidiary will begin a
tender offer of $85 cash per share for up to 26.1 million shares of
the company, or 94 percent of the total. Kohlberg will offer a
package of securities it valued at $85 per share for the remaining
6 percent.
   If all shareholders tender their shares, Kohlberg will offer
them $80 cash and $5 in securities per share. The total offer
values the company's 27.76 million shares at $2.36 billion.
   The Bass group, which owns about 9.2 percent of Macmillan's
shares, had a $75-a-share offer outstanding for the company, but
most analysts believed that was Bass's way of raising the stock's
value through takeover speculation. If the Bass group sold its
shares to Kohlberg it would make about $75 million.

   The repurchase of approximately 6.7 million shares will be made

   Members of Congress wary of granting banks new
securities powers are marshaling evidence to back their position by
looking at U.S. banks' overseas operations.
   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., called a meeting of his Energy
and Commerce oversight subcommittee today to review a General
Accounting Office report suggesting banks may have problems
handling new powers.
   Although banks are barred from most securities activities in the
United States, Federal Reserve rules permit bank subsidiaries to
trade and underwrite securities abroad.
   The GAO, at the request of Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.,
looked at how large U.S. banks with European operations fared in
the London markets in 1986 and 1987.
   ``Bank examination reports ... indicate that most of the London
securities subsidiaries of U.S. banks recorded losses or were
marginally profitable,'' the report said, noting that the problems
were made worse by the world stock market crash in October 1987.
   The GAO attributed U.S. banks' poor showing in London in part to
``significant management and internal control problems.'' However,
it also took note of the turbulence of the London market, which
recently had been deregulated by the British government.
   Eighteen of the 50 U.S. banks operating in London engaged in at
least some securities underwriting and dealing, the watchdog agency
said.
   In several instances during the period of the crash, London
securities subsidiaries were forced to call on their parent U.S.
banks for infusions of capital to make up for losses, it said.
   ``This study foreshadows the threat to our banking system if
banks are allowed unfettered entry into our domestic securities
markets,'' said Markey, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
finance subcommittee.
   Dingell and Markey are using the study in their efforts to
counter bills that would repeal or substantially alter the 1933
Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and investment
banking in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash and subsequent
wave of bank failures.
   Bills granting banks new securities powers have passed the full
Senate and the House Banking Committee. The legislation must be
reviewed by Dingell's committee before the full House can act.
   Both Dingell and Markey have expressed skepticism about relaxing
the Glass-Steagall barriers. In a television interview over the
weekend, Dingell said ``if I have any say'' such legislation will
not be enacted this year.

<HEAD>Report Says Taiwan Planning To Cut More Tariffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan plans to cut import tariffs on
several additional products, including mineral oils and cooling
equipment, to help reduce trade friction with the United States, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The widely circulated China Times quoted unidentified financial
officials as saying Taiwan would lower tariffs on the 56
``competitive U.S. products to effectively ease trade tension''
between Taiwan and its chief trading partner.
   For each of the 56 items, U.S.-made products currently make up
more than 20 percent of Taiwan's imports of that item, the
newspaper said.
   Wang Fu-jen, a Customs Administration official, declined to
comment on the newspaper report.
   Last month, Taiwan announced it would cut import tariffs on 335
other items later this month.
   The newspaper said tariffs would be cut for 52 of the 175 items
for which U.S. negotiators requested reductions during trade talks
in April.
   However, tariffs will be cut for only two of the 102
agricultural items requested by the U.S. side because Taiwanese
officials believe local farmers need protection, the newspaper said.
   The new items include broth, mineral oils, compressors and
cooling equipment, it said.
   In February, tariffs on 3,500 items were cut by an average of 50
percent in Taiwan's most sweeping tariff cuts.
   Taiwan has been under U.S. pressure to reduce its large
bilateral trade surplus. Trade between Taiwan and the United States
last year totaled $31.2 billion, with Taiwan's exports exceeding
imports by $16 billion.
   During the first eight months of this year, Taiwan's imports
from the United States totaled $9.3 billion, up 102 percent from a
year earlier. Its bilateral trade surplus totaled $6.4 billion
during the period.

<TEXT>
   Inflation and labor shortages are two major
economic problems facing Hong Kong, Financial Secretary Piers
Jacobs said Tuesday.
   Jacobs, in an evaluation of the economy's performance, also
slightly revised his projection of this year's growth rate to 6
percent from 5 percent, still well below the 13.5 percent rate for
1987.
   Interest rate increases in the United States and Europe and the
slower economic growth worldwide are contributing factors in the
decline in growth of the British colony's export-fueled economy, he
said.
   Jacobs noted, however, that the local economy ``is still
operating close to capacity, so that inflation and labor shortages
continue to be our two major concerns.''
   He said the inflation rate was expected to hit 7.5 percent this
year, slightly higher than previously projected. The unemployment
rate, 1.8 percent in June, has reached historic lows, resulting in
rapid increases of wages and salaries, Jacobs added.
   The government is considering easing a ban on the import of
foreign labor because of the widespread labor shortages, but Jacobs
did not say whether he favored such a move.

   International Business Machines Corp. says the
internal design of its Personal System-2 computers is the path to
the future, but its rivals are heading in a different direction.
   Compaq Computer Corp. and a host of others, including
Hewlett-Packard Co., Tandy Corp., Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti & Co.
SpA, Japan's NEC Corp. and Epson America Inc., and Zenith Data
Systems, are rallying around an alternative to the Micro Channel
found inside the more expensive models of IBM's Personal System-2.
   The rivals say their ``bus,'' which controls the way information
is passed between components of a computer, is a simpler and less
disruptive transition from the bus of the AT personal computer than
IBM's Micro Channel is.
   The new bus, dubbed EISA, for Extended Industry Standard
Architecture, was unveiled today at a New York news conference.
   The companies expect that the first products incorporating the
new bus will begin to emerge in late 1989, said Rod Canion, the
president and chief executive of Compaq.
   Other companies pledging support to the new standard were Intel
Corp., the chip maker, Microsoft Corp., the software company, and
several leading makers of communications equipment and software.
   ``I think it (EISA) will be a problem for IBM,'' Norman Weizer,
an analyst at Arthur D. Little Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., said
Monday. ``I think IBM did misguess as to how closely its technology
would be followed.''
   Even IBM has acknowledged that not all customers want its new
Micro Channel. The cheaper members of its Personal System-2 line
don't have it, and IBM was expected to unveil two more of those
models today.
   The new machines will use the same microprocessor as IBM's old
AT and will be aggressively priced.
   IBM fears uncontrolled copying of its technology, which would
keep it from preventing shoddy knock-offs and deprive it of
licensing payments to defray the expense of its research and
development.
   But if no other company copies the internal design of the new
Personal System-2 line, it won't become an industry standard and
software developers won't create many programs for it. Without good
software available, customers won't want to buy the machine.
   IBM's competitors say there is no good reason for computer
buyers to adopt the Micro Channel.
   Analysts say EISA will speed up the movement of information but
still allow computers to use older add-on equipment, such as memory
cards, graphics cards and data storage devices.
   Customers buying IBM's PS-2 have to buy all new add-on
equipment, although there is less need for it because there are
more built-in features.
   There is little IBM can do about the rival effort except try to
convince computer users that its design offers more room for growth
in the long run.
   Even if IBM's Micro Channel ultimately prevails, the new bus
from the rival coalition is likely to slow down the development of
new programs by fragmenting the efforts of software developers.
   Software developers may prefer to concentrate their efforts on
programs for computers that don't use Micro Channel, especially if
the new bus gives them a new lease on life, said Bruce L. Davis,
chairman of the Software Publishers Association.
   ``The question is whether we need to make the technological leap
to the Micro Channel Architecture right now,'' said Davis, who is
also president and chief executive of Mediagenic in Menlo Park,
Calif.

<HEAD>Price-Fixing Charges Against American, United Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that United
Airlines and American Airlines did not conspire to fix fees on
their computerized reservation systems as several other carriers
had charged.
   In handing down his decision Monday, U.S. District Judge Edward
Rafeedie held that the airlines had no evidence to support any
inference of conspiracy, but were relying solely on speculation.
   The plaintiffs, including Continental Airlines, USAir Group
Inc., Northwest Airlines, had sought more than $1.1 billion in
recovery of such fees paid to American and United from 1984 to 1987.
   Chicago-based United is the nation's largest airline, while
American, based in Fort Worth, is the second biggest.
   ``American considers this to be a major victory,'' Anne H.
McNamara, the airline's senior vice president and general counsel
said Monday.
   ``We feel totally vindicated by the decision, because the judge
recognized the conspiracy charges for what they are _ absolute
speculation.''
   In their antitrust complaint against American and United, the
plaintiffs contended the defendants participated in a conspiracy
spanning several years to raise the other carriers' cost of doing
business.
   Specifically, plaintiffs accused the two airlines of illegally
agreeing to fix the price of ``booking fees'' charged by SABRE and
Apollo _ the American and United computerized reservations systems,
respectively, beginning in November 1984.
   At that time American announced it would charge other airlines
$1.75 per booking for the SABRE service. United later established a
price of $1.85.
   The plaintiffs also alleged the two defendants unlawfully forced
other carriers to pay what the industry terms ``interline ticketing
fees,'' which are paid when one airline issues a ticket on its own
internal ``ticket stock'' for travel on another airline, such as
when a passenger's itinerary involves two or more carriers for a
single trip.
   The court found American and United had met their ``procedural
burden'' of showing each had independently decided on the level of
booking fees after November 1984 and on establishment of a
reimbursement charge for interline ticketing services.
   On Aug. 12, Rafeedie granted American's and United's motions for
summary judgment on two of three of the plaintiffs' principal
monopolization theories: that SABRE and Apollo are ``essential
facilities'' and that the defendants engaged in ``monopoly
leveraging.''

<HEAD>Woodworkers Ratify Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only about 400 woodworkers remain on
strike at Pacific Northwest mills after 1,300 others ratified a
four-year contract with DAW Forest Products Co. and W-I Forest
Products Inc., union leaders said.
   Bill Hubbell, president of the International Woodworkers of
America-U.S., said Monday a tentative contract approved last week
was ratified Sunday by members of his union in Oregon, Montana and
Idaho.
   Members of the Western Council of Industrial Workers also
approved the agreement, according to spokesman Brad Witt.
   Union members at two small wood products plants in Oregon are
the only woodworkers still on strike. At its height, the summer
woodworkers' strike idled 9,000 workers in five states in the
Pacific Northwest.
   IWA business agent Bert Larson in central Oregon said the two
unions voted 3-1 in favor of the contract.
   The agreement matched one ratified Aug. 4 by woodworkers at
Willamette Industries Inc. of Portland, Hubbell said.
   The agreement provided for $1,400 bonuses during the first year
of the contract, plus raises totaling 11 percent in the last three
years. Officials said the ratified contract reflected an improved
offer by DAW and W-I .
   As a result of the settlement, the unions asked the National
Labor Relations Board to drop an unfair labor practice charge
against the two companies, officials said.
   The strike began June 6 and affected dozens of logging
operations and lumber mills in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana,
and Northern California.
   The unions demanded increases in basic wage rates to restore
cuts accepted two years ago, when the companies sought concessions
to withstand a recession in the industry. But the companies balked,
offering annual bonuses and production incentives instead.
   The weekend settlement affects DAW plants in Bend and Redmond;
Coeur d'Alene and Albeni Falls, Idaho; and Superior, Mont. W-I
mills affected are in Coeur d' Alene and Sandpoint, Idaho.
   All the plants reopened Monday except the one at Sandpoint,
which remained closed while air-quality questions were worked out
with local officials.

<HEAD>Chain Ponders Restructuring After Hafts Get OK to Buy Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kroger Co. said today it was exploring a $3.77
billion defensive restructuring that would plunge the supermarket
giant into debt and force it to sell assets after the Haft family,
well known for hostile takeover attempts, won federal clearance to
acquire a chunk of the company.
   The nation's largest grocery chain, which operates more than
1,300 supermarkets, 900 convenience stores and other operations in
29 states, said in a statement that the possible restructuring was
prompted partly by ``the high level of takeover and restructuring
activity involving supermarket companies.''
   The statement also mentioned a Federal Trade Commission ruling
Friday that allows the Hafts, a Maryland-based clan of corporate
takeover strategists who have unsuccessfully chased other
supermarket chains but made huge profits in the process, to acquire
at least $15 million worth of Kroger stock.
   Kroger said the restructuring would involve substantial but
unspecified bank loans, pay shareholders $48 in cash and securities
per share and allow them to keep their stock. Kroger has about
78.57 million shares outstanding.
   ``The substantial debt would be repaid from cash flow from
operations, disposition of non-core and underproductive assets,
significant reduction in capital expenditures and reduced
expenses,'' Lyle Everingham, chairman and chief executive officer
of the Cincinnati-based company, said in the statement. The FTC
ruling was the first official sign of the Hafts' interest in
Kroger. But the commission's statement did not say how much Kroger
stock the Hafts want to buy. Representatives for the Hafts declined
to comment.
   Kroger's stock has traded heavily over the past five months
partly because of rumors that the Hafts and other potential
acquirers were interested in the company.
   News of the commission's decision started circulating Friday,
sending Kroger's stock up $1.25 in heavy trading to close at $38 a
share. On Monday the company's stock closed up another $1.50 at
$39.50, also on heavy trading.
   One analyst predicted that the Hafts would likely break up
Kroger if they purchased it.
   ``It's almost certain that they'll start dismantling the company
and selling off its assets,'' said Gary M. Giblen, vice president
at Rotan-Mosle, a Houston-based subsidiary of the investment firm
of PaineWebber Inc.
   But, Giblen also said that Robert Haft and his father, Herbert,
who operate the Dart Group of Landover, Md., may be serious about
running a grocery company. They demonstrated that earlier this
spring, when they bought a small Washington, D.C., grocery chain.
Instead of selling it off for the cash, the Hafts are using the
company to learn how to manage a grocery firm, Giblen said.
   The Hafts have failed in their efforts to buy such companies as
Safeway, Supermarkets General and Stop & Shop, but have made
profits in selling stock shares back to those companies.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that Monsanto
Co. also could be held liable for damages from the Copper-7
intrauterine device that is produced by its subsidiary G.D. Searle
& Co.
   The ruling Monday by U.S. District Judge Robert Renner
represents a second legal setback for Monsanto involving the
Copper-7 device, which was taken off the market in 1986, a year
after Monsanto acquired Searle.
   Last week Searle was ordered by a jury to pay $8.75 million in
punitive and compensatory damages to Esther Kociemba, an Elk River,
Minn., woman who said the IUD caused her to become sterile.
   In the latest case, Renner ruled that Julie Daher, of Columbia
Heights, Minn., could sue both Searle and Monsanto for damages from
a Copper-7 she used between October 1984 and October 1987.
   Monsanto, based in St. Louis, Mo., had been named as
co-defendant in about two dozen Copper-7 cases, but all of those
cases had been dismissed in court or dropped by the plaintiffs
until Monday's decision.
   Monsanto stock plunged after the ruling Monday, falling $7.12{
to $78.62{ in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In
early trading today it was off another $1.50 to $77.12{.
   Daher's attorneys claim Monsanto acted in concert with Searle in
misrepresenting the safety of the Copper-7 and fraudulently
concealing dangers associated with the device after it acquired
Searle in October 1985 for $2.8 billion.
   Legal experts have said Friday's jury verdict could result in
thousands of lawsuits against Searle.
   Monsanto maintains ``there simply is no justification for the
jury's action.''

   ``That sent the whole group into a tailspin,'' said Hildegarde

   The market continues to await Wednesday's government report on
the nation's merchandise trade deficit for July. The announcement
early today that the U.S. current-account deficit shrank by 9.8
percent in the second quarter to $33.3 billion had little impact
since it is a less recent reading of the trade picture.
   The current account is the broadest measure of a country's
trade, while the July merchandise trade report will be a more
narrow and recent indicator.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A contraption that sucks bad bugs off
strawberry plants may become a handy tool for farmers in the drive
to kill pests without using so many chemicals.
   Three farming members of Driscoll Strawberry Associates Inc. of
Watsonville, in northern California, are using a company-designed
machine called a BugVac this year to vacuum lygus bugs off their
plants.
   The custom-made vacuum machine, mounted on a tractor, moves down
rows of young berries, providing just enough suction to zap lygus
bugs that like to live near the top of the plants.
   Beneficial insects that live lower on the plants are not
disturbed by the machine, explained Driscoll researcher Ed Show.
Green leaves and the ripening fruit also are left unharmed.
   Show adapted the idea from a hand vacuum the University of
California developed years ago to test the levels of insect
populations. The researcher's innovation consists of hydraulically
driven fans and suction hoses.
   ``The vacuum doesn't deep clean the whole strawberry plant,''
Show said in an interview. ``We're affecting only the bugs on the
top part of the plant. It will suck up and remove bugs of all
kinds, the good and the bad, but it's not as detrimental to the
beneficial insect community.''
   Perhaps the main benefit from the BugVac is saving the
beneficial insects needed to eat other damaging bugs such as
western spider mites, which have become resistant to pesticides.
   ``We have no effective miticides to control spider mites, so if
we spray for lygus bugs, we create a real spider mite problem
because we knock out the beneficial insects,'' Show says.
   Vacuum cleaning the plants does not eliminate as many lygus bugs
as spraying them with pesticides would. However, growers who tried
the new technique were able to keep the lygus bug population close
to or slightly below what is termed the economic threshold in
integrated pest management _ the level at which the pest population
causes financial losses.
   ``We're learning how many lygus bugs we can get away with in a
field,'' Show said.
   The board of Driscoll Associates, which provides its own
patented strawberry varieties to affiliated growers, asked Show to
find ways to reduce or eliminate as much use of pesticides as
possible because of increasing regulatory restrictions, increasing
resistance by bugs to some chemicals and doubts about whether
adequate new chemicals will become available.
   Show decided to adapt the DVac machine, a hand-held or backpack
device used to suck up small numbers of pests in estimating how
badly a field is infested.
   ``Given that basic idea, we built a prototype on bicycle wheels,
pushed it through test plots and found it could catch what seemed
like an impressive number of lygus bugs,'' Show said.
   This was the first season growers used Show's device
commercially, and the three who had machines built seem satisfied
with the results.
   Reiter Affiliated of Watsonville used a BugVac on 71 acres of
strawberries at Salinas, about 125 miles south of San Francisco,
and plans to have two more machines built for use on all of the
company's 225 acres next year.
   General manager Tom Jones estimates the vacuum machine saved
$100-$200 an acre over the cost of pesticides, and owner Miles
Reiter said the savings may even be higher.
   ``It's been a real good deal for us,'' Jones said.
   Mike McCluney of Watsonville, who manufactures the BugVacs, says
he's now built nine or 10 and has orders for at least that many
more with still other farmers considering the device. The cost of
the machines runs between $12,000 and $17,000.
   ``It definitely does work under most circumstances when properly
used with integrated pest management and other methods,'' McCluney
said. ``It's not just a replacement for a spray tractor but needs
to be in conjunction with predator releases.''
   Use of the BugVac may spread from strawberries to other
California vegetables, such as lettuce.
   ``There's interest on the part of some other vegetable
growers,'' said Show, adding that he has heard of at least one
Maine farmer who uses a similar apparatus to control potato beetles.
   McCluney said he plans a trip to Brawley in southeastern
California ``to see if we can use this new idea to help out with
their white fly problem.''

   Corn and soybean futures opened lower today on
the Chicago Board of Trade while wheat traded higher, all in
reaction to Monday's crop production report from Agriculture
Department.
   The government's new harvest projections of 4.46 billion bushels
of corn and 1.47 billion bushels of soybeans were higher than the
market had expected, prompting many players to sell contracts for
future delivery of those commodities, analysts said.
   The USDA's wheat production number _ 1.81 billion bushels _ also
was higher than expected. But its bearish implications were more
than offset by new government predictions of lower grain production
in the Soviet Union and Canada, and a forecast for increased grain
imports by the Soviets. The United States is negotiating a new
long-term agreement to supply grain to the Soviets.
   Demand concerns have replaced supply fears as the main influence
on crop futures prices and will continue to dominate trading as the
corn and soybean harvest progresses, said Ted Mao, grain specialist
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   ``The key is how is the demand going to respond, when are the
spurts of business going to come, how is the market going to handle
the fact that over the next 60 days we are going to be harvesting
and maximizing the supply side in the U.S.,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 3\ cents to 6 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.08 a bushel; corn was 1
cent lower to 1} cents higher with September at $2.85 a bushel;
oats were { cent to 2{ cents higher with December at $2.75 a
bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 8 cents lower with September at
$8.66 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .22 cent to .48 cent higher with October at
70.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with September at 79.15 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to
.68 cent higher with October at 38.40 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .08 cent to 1.23 cents higher with February at 47.50
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Monday.

<HEAD>Fine Tuning for High Strength, Japan Leading The Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After learning from Japan about modern
furnaces, enlightened labor relations and customer service,
American steelmakers are once again looking across the Pacific
Ocean _ this time for a steel process that may help protect U.S.
warships at sea and tanks on land.
   High-strength, low-alloy steel plate _ easier to weld, less
dependent on hard-to-get alloying elements and potentially cheaper
to make _ is the latest fruit of the Japanese industrial system.
   ``It's the wave of the future,'' said Charles Null, head of the
metals branch of the U.S. Navy's Sea Systems Command.
   American steelmakers lag Japan by 10 to 15 years in the
computer-controlled processing needed to make the super-tough
steel. But the Navy is anxious to catch up.
   ``The Navy wants to build ships out of world-class steel. They
want the best that money can buy, and they're willing to pay for
it,'' said Harry I. McHenry, a steel specialist for the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, formerly the National Bureau
of Standards.
   ``But right now, the American steel plate producers don't have
all the technical tools available to them,'' McHenry said in a
telephone interview from his Boulder, Colo., office.
   Besides the Navy's support, the Army is interested in the new
plate for its armored vehicles. The material has applications in
commercial shipping as well.
   The Defense Department hopes to win its request for $5.5 million
in the 1989 defense budget to send American steel to Japan for
processing and to bring it back for testing. If the plate meets
specifications and Congress appropriates more money, the department
would negotiate with domestic steel companies for one of them to
upgrade a plate mill with the new technology in exchange for
guaranteed sales.
   ``We're very excited about this project. I think it has a great
deal of potential for the U.S. steel industry,'' said Michael
Corridore, a Pentagon industrial specialist who heads the program.
   McHenry said the reasons American steelmakers lag the Japanese
in this area are intertwined with the forces that helped undermine
America's postwar industrial power. Japan steelmakers invested
early on in research that led to computerized processing, the key
to more precise manipulating of steel's metallurgical properties as
the metal is heated, cooled, squeezed and stretched.
   By 1983, Japan's five major plate makers were using controlled
cooling, which helps reduce the need for alloying steel with
niobium, molybdenum and other elements that make the finished
plates tricky to weld.
   It's the heart of the technology the Pentagon is willing to pay
American steelmakers to adopt. It is a follow-up technology to
controlled rolling, which the Japanese commercialized in the late
1960s. America adopted that in the 1980s, McHenry said.
   ``I don't think the industry is being stubborn or hard-headed or
ignorant by not adopting this technology,'' McHenry said. ``The
technology is not that attractive from a commercial standpoint.''
   ``We're not stupid in this country despite what you read,'' said
Marshal Mazur, manager of government programs for Bethlehem Steel
Corp., a leading plate maker. ``We've been aware of this technology
for a long time. But we're a free market economy, and we don't
always have access to all the capital that you need to invest in
technology.
   ``That situation hasn't always presented itself to our trading
partners, so it's real easy for the Japanese with easy access to
capital to go down their wish list and made a decision to
proceed,'' Mazur said.
   Without government underwriting, ``there's no way you can
justify putting these units in,'' said Anthony De Ardo, director of
the Basic Metals Processing Research Institute at the University of
Pittsburgh.
   De Ardo, however, is not a fan of the new Japanese technology
and thinks the Pentagon should be looking to U.S. labs for help.
   ``I think the Pentagon has been sold a bill of goods on this,''
he said. ``But I give them the benefit of the doubt. They really
believe they're doing something that's correct.''
   De Ardo said Japanese steelmakers ``have shown the benefits of
accelerated cooling to much of our military, and there's no
question that what they're saying is true. It's just that I think
our steel industry needs many things to benefit the military before
they get to an accelerated cooling unit.''
   Controlled cooling, also called accelerated cooling, involves
computers calculating exactly when to spray water on a hot plate as
it emerges in its final shape from a rolling mill.
   ``But it's not that simple,'' said McHenry, who recommended
high-strength, low-alloy steel to the Navy after studying the new
process for a year in Japan.
   ``The computer ... controls when the cooling starts and when the
cooling stops, what the volume of water is, what the distribution
of water is from side to side and what the rate of travel of the
plate through this shower is,'' he said.
   The Japanese coupled that technique to direct rolling, in which
molten steel is cast into 8-inch thick slabs, then rolled directly
into plate an inch or so thick.
   The method eliminates the time- and energy-consuming steps of
cooling the slabs to room temperature to be inspected, cleaned of
surface defects and reheated. It is possible only with steel of
precise and consistent composition, itself a benefit of
computer-controlled furnaces.
   Together, those processes allow for reductions in alloying
elements, including chromium and vanadium which the Soviet Union
and South Africa control.
   Japan developed the processes to supply to its busy fabricators,
who produce off-shore drilling platforms and transcontinental
pipelines.

<HEAD>McCormick Sells Real Estate Division for $550 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCormick & Co. Inc. has agreed to sell its
real estate subsidiary for about $550 million to a joint venture of
the Rouse Co. and the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.
   Clifford F. Ransom 2nd, senior vice president of the
institutional research department of the Baltimore-based brokerage
firm Baker Watts & Co., said Monday the sale of McCormick
Properties Inc. would give the spice giant a pretax gain of more
than $200 million.
   McCormick is the world's largest spice manufacturer, with 1987
sales of $1.1 billion.
   The deal will substantially boost McCormick's stock value while
allowing it ``to focus on the work that is closest to its core
business _ the food, spice, flavorings, extracts business,'' Ransom
said.
   James J. Harrison Jr., McCormick's vice president and chief
financial officer, said the company has no firm plans for what it
will do with the cash.
   ``Our highest priority is an acquisition or acquisitions in our
core businesses, including the consumer products area, and also in
the food service area,'' he said. ``Other uses we've thought about
include the retirement of debt and stock repurchases.''
   The purchase gives Rouse, a real estate company, an opportunity
to diversify into office, industrial, and research and development
properties in the Baltimore-Washington corridor.
   The sale involves all McCormick's real estate holdings, which
amount to about 9 million square feet of office space, said Larry
Lichtenauer, McCormick spokesman.
   The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the
year.
   Mathias J. DeVito, Rouse's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the deal was being financed by the Teachers and Insurance
Annuity Association, a large pension fund plan for college and high
school teachers that has financed or participated in joint ventures
with other Rouse projects.

<HEAD>London Stocks Up 11.7 Points</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with close.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices moved higher Tuesday as the market
was buoyed by developments in the oil sector.
   Confidence was given a much needed boost by British Gas PLC,
which staged a ``dawn raid,'' scooping up shares in London and
Scottish Marine Oil Co., known as Lasmo.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed up
11.7 points, or 0.7 percent, at 1,756.3.
   Trading volume was 369.2 million shares, compared with 213.2
million shares traded during Monday's session.
   Although British Gas failed to achieve its target of aquiring a
14.9-percent stake in Lasmo, the hectic buying and the general
speculation surrounding the raid helped the whole oil sector and
share prices generally.
   ``You can see what happens to this market when there's a little
bit of good news,'' said Roger Charlesworth, senior dealer at Chase
Manhattan Securities Ltd. in London.
   The market has lately been plagued by confusion over the
near-term direction for equities and by particularly low levels of
participation.
   The raid on Lasmo started before the official market opening,
with the brokerage Hoare Govett Ltd. offering to purchase Lasmo
shares on behalf of British Gas at 480 pence, or $8.16, apiece,
well above Monday's closing Lasmo price of 390 pence.
   Hoare Govett said it obtained a small amount of Lasmo's stock.
   The raid sparked speculation of a forthcoming takeover bid for
Lasmo.
   Takeover speculation also surrounded Enterprise Oil PLC, another
independent British oil company, because of Lasmo's 25 percent
holding in Enterprise.
   A successful bidder for Lasmo could use the Enterprise holding
as a platform for a bid for Enterprise as well, analysts said.
   Lasmo shares surged to close at 543 pence, a jump of 153 pence.
Enterprise closed 126 pence higher at 562 pence.

   The U.S. dollar firmed against all major
currencies except the Canadian dollar in European trading Tuesday.
Gold prices also rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said trading was dull with markets
waiting for Wednesday's U.S. trade figures.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6965 late Tuesday, more
expensive for buyers than Monday's late $1.6958.
   Other late rates in Europe, compared with late rates Monday,
included: 1.8470 West German marks, up from 1.8453; 1.5600 Swiss

   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 133.07 Japanese yen, down from
133.42 yen at Monday's close. In later London trading the dollar
traded at 133.30 yen.
   Gold bullion prices moved higher in a recovery from low levels
Monday, when the price fell below $420 for the first time this
year, undermined by weaker prices for oil and other commodities.
   Gold closed in London at a late bid of $420 a troy ounce, up
from $419.25, and in Zurich at $421 bid, up from $418.
   Gold closed in Hong Kong at $422.69 bid, up from $419.18.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a late bid of $6.46 a

   The stock market was lower in early trading
today, lacking momentum as traders waited for Wednesday's report on
the nation's merchandise trade deficit for July.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 3.56 points at
2,068.81 at 2 p.m. EDT, having bounced back from an early fall of
10.31 points and then stayed in a narrow range.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by around 7-to-5, with 749
issues down, 559 up and 536 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 119.05 million shares. Activity
was said to be dampened, though less so than on Monday, by the
observance of the Jewish New Year holiday.
   ``Rip Van Winkle would love this one,'' said Bill Raftery, an
analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``It's like watching
paint dry on the walls.''
   Analysts said the overall market was dragged down early in the
session by negative news affecting shares of semiconductor
companies, including National Semiconductor Corp.'s reported loss
Monday of $30.5 million in its first fiscal quarter.
   Shares of National Semiconductor, one of the most actively
traded companies, were down } at 8].
   ``That sent the whole group into a tailspin,'' said Hildegarde
Zagorski, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The market continues to await Wednesday's Commerce Department
report on the merchandise trade deficit for July. The announcement
early today that the U.S. current-account deficit shrank by 9.8
percent in the second quarter to $33.3 billion had little impact
since it is a less recent reading of the trade picture.
   The current account is the broadest measure of a country's
trade, while the July merchandise trade report will be a more
narrow and recent indicator.
   ``They're waiting for a signal, either from the outside world or
from the market itself,'' said Michael Metz, an analyst for
Oppenheimer & Co. ``The market lacks real conviction, real
direction.''
   Many observers expect the July trade report to show a deficit of
around $11.5 billion.

   Ken Oshman and other former executives
of Rolm Corp. now at Ultra Network Technologies are introducing a
product Oshman says will revolutionize the world of high-speed
computer networks.
   ``It is, in a real sense, uncharted waters,'' Oshman, Ultra's
chairman, said Monday of the new network being unveiled next
Tuesday.
   Ultra's system, which already has won endorsements from several
makers of a new generation of so-called mini-supercomputers, is
essentially a local area network that passes information among
computers at a theoretical maximum rate of 1 billion bits per
second.
   Ultra can transfer the contents of an encyclopedia in a few
seconds, 100 times faster than one widely used network for office
computers.
   Supercomputers need faster local area networks because computer
speed has outpaced the ability of the machines to transfer
information.
   ``Ultra has basically found a very fast way of allowing
high-performance computers to talk to each other,'' said Richard
Shaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter in New York. ``It is
hot stuff.''
   Several makers of high-speed computers have agreed to market the
network and connect their machines to the system.
   Rolm, his former company, was sold to IBM in 1984.

<HEAD>Execs: Drought Hurt River Barge Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives of river barge companies say this
summer's drought stalled their efforts to recover from some lean
years.
   After a severe recession in the early 1980s, when some barge
lines merged and others went broke, the companies saw 1988 as the
year to cap a comeback. But they have been unpleasantly surprised
by mounting losses.
   ``Finally this year, people began to make money until Mother
Nature gave us a lousy deal,'' Jeffrey Smith, vice president of the
trade group American Waterways Operators, said Monday.
   A study commissioned by the trade group projected the industry
this year will suffer losses of as much as $200 million on revenue
of $1 billion, Smith said. Operating costs of barge companies have
soared while many of the rates are fixed by long-term contracts,
officials said.
   The barge industry struggled as a whole from 1982 to 1986, when
an oversupply of barges depressed hauling rates. Congress had
proposed several bills that would help the industry by tax
deferrals or direct subsidies, but in August the industry announced
it wanted no help, Smith said.
   Commercial traffic on the dam-regulated Ohio River has continued
without a hitch despite the summer drought, but shallow water in
the lower Mississippi River has tied up barges and $7,000-a-day
towboats. Travel time for barges has doubled this summer.
   In addition, special drought restrictions reduced by half the
number of barges that are allowed to be lashed together, requiring
barge companies to use more tow boats. The restrictions also limit
the load each barge can carry.
   ``A turnaround year turned into a real dumper,'' said Morris
Larson, executive vice president of the Merchants Exchange of St.
Louis, where the price of barge transportation for grain is
determined in trade.
   Slower travel and the smaller loads caused a shortage of barges
and boats this summer, said Richard A. Hain, executive vice
president of M-G Transport Services Inc., a Cincinnati barge
company.
   ``It was difficult to quote prices because there weren't any
barges available,'' he said.
   He said there was a substantial decline in company profits this
summer.
   At Midland Enterprises Inc., another Cincinnati-based line,
profits will be down although the company will still make money,
said Steve Frasher, vice president of operations.
   ``This (drought) was not needed at this time,'' Frasher said.

Baker, head of block trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.

   Crop futures prices closed mostly higher Tuesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade as strength from the buoyant wheat
market spilled over into the corn and soybean pits.
   Corn and soybean futures had opened lower in reaction to the
Agriculture Department's higher-than-expected harvest estimates,
issued after the close of trading on Monday.
   The report estimated 1988 U.S. corn production at 4.46 billion
bushels and soybean production at 1.47 billion bushels. The numbers
represent sharp declines from last year's production levels because
of drought damage, but were still above most private forecasts.
   The USDA's wheat-production estimate also was higher than
expected but wheat futures prices rallied on the report's
predictions of declining Soviet and Canadian wheat production and
increasing Soviet grain imports.
   Tuesday's market performance ``is a reflection of the fact that
while everyone was focused on the disappointing numbers put out by
USDA domestically, the world numbers for wheat came out friendly,''
said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York.
   With potential crop-weather problems developing in South America
and severe crop losses a hard fact in the United States and Canada,
``the world situation is still tight'' for wheat, Mao said.
   At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 9} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.11 a bushel; corn was 1
cent lower to 2} cents higher with September at $2.85 a bushel;
oats were 2 cents to 3{ cents higher with September at $2.64 a
bushel; soybeans were 5{ cents to 8{ cents higher with September at
$8.76 a bushel.

   The stock market finished higher in mostly
sluggish trading today, getting a last-minute boost from remarks by
Treasury secretary designate Nicholas F. Brady.
   The statements touched off a late buying wave, after stocks
traded slightly lower through most of the session.
   Brady, an investment banker nominated by President Reagan to
replace former Treasury chief James Baker, said at his Senate
confirmation hearing that he expects the nation's trade deficit to
decline at a ``surprisingly fast'' pace over the next few years.
   Analysts said the market interpreted Brady's comments as hinting
that Wednesday's scheduled government report on the merchandise
trade report for July would be encouraging.
   Activity on Wall Street had been stalled today as participants
awaited the July trade report, and Brady's remarks gave the
lackluster market a lift, analysts said. Volume also was dampened,
though less so than on Monday, by the observance of the Jewish New
Year holiday.
   ``Rip Van Winkle would love this one,'' said Bill Raftery, an
analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``It's like watching
paint dry on the walls.''
   Analysts said the overall market was dragged down early in the
session by negative news affecting shares of semiconductor
companies, including National Semiconductor Corp.'s loss reported
Monday of $30.5 million in its first fiscal quarter.
   ``That sent the whole group into a tailspin,'' said Hildegarde
Zagorski, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The announcement early today that the U.S. current-account
deficit shrank by 9.8 percent in the second quarter to $33.3
billion had little impact since it is a less recent reading of the
trade picture than Wednesday's report.
   The current account is the broadest measure of a country's
trade, while the July merchandise trade report will be a more
narrow and recent indicator.
   ``They're waiting for a signal, either from the outside world or
from the market itself,'' said Michael Metz, an analyst for
Oppenheimer & Co. ``The market lacks real conviction, real
direction.''
   Most observers expect the July report to show a merchandise
trade gap of around $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion.

<HEAD>IBM's Rivals Declare Their Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine personal computer makers declared their
independence from International Business Machines Corp. on Tuesday
with a new standard for how information will be passed around
inside their machines.
   Analysts said the announcement of the new ``bus,'' or data
pathway, killed for good the lingering idea that IBM would control
the standards for the next generation of personal computers.
   ``It's IBM and the rest of us,'' said William Krause, chairman
and chief executive of 3Com Corp., which makes communications
software for machines made by both IBM and its rivals.
   In an unusually busy day for the computer industry, there were
these other important developments:
   _The New York Times reported that IBM would link up with a
former nemesis, Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Computer
Inc. It said IBM will spend $10 million for a license to use
technology developed by Jobs' new company, Next Inc.
   _IBM announced a way for its most advanced personal computers to
run the huge library of programs written for its System 36
minicomputers. It also introduced three improved models of its 9370
minicomputers and two fast but inexpensive members of its Personal
System-2 family.
   _Digital Equipment Corp. opened its annual DEC World show in
Cannes, France, by unveiling plans to expand its business of
helping companies plan and manage their computer and communications
systems. At the same time, it announced a way to monitor and manage
an entire far-flung computer network from a single point.
   _Computer Associates International Inc. of Garden City, N.Y.,
the world's largest independent software company, announced
agreement on a $170 million purchase of Applied Research Inc. of
Princeton, N.J., from Ameritech, the Chicago-based telephone
holding company.
   The nine companies that gathered for a New York news conference
have agreed on standards for a bus, which specifies the way
information is passed between the processor, keyboard, screen,
memory and other components.
   The capabilities of the new bus, which had been kept secret,
exceeded the expectations of many industry watchers. The companies
said it will outperform IBM's Micro Channel in several respects,
including the speed at which it can handle bursts of data.
   Tuesday's announcement was important because it helped set
standards that will last into the 1990s, when advanced personal
computers will be as fast as today's fastest mainframe computers.
   ``This is a great day for the industry,'' said Mark D. Stahlman,
an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. ``IBM's Micro Channel is
now just one of a number of alternatives.''
   It appears that there will be three main competitors in coming
years: the Micro Channel inside advanced models of IBM's Personal
System-2; the NuBus inside advanced models of Apple Computer Inc.'s
Macintosh, and the bus announced Tuesday, EISA, for Extended
Industry Standard Architecture.
   Although Houston's Compaq Computer Corp. is believed to have
been a main instigator of the project, it played down its role.
   ``It just gained momentum. I don't think you can single out any
one or even a few companies,'' said Ron Canion, president and chief
executive of Compaq, which soared into the Fortune 500 in record
time by successfully challenging IBM in personal computers.
   Computers built on the new bus will not be available until the
second half of 1989. That gives IBM time to convince customers that
if they want a more powerful bus, they should buy an IBM Personal
System-2, which is already on the market.
   ``My question is, if you're going to buy a machine today,
wouldn't you want to buy a machine that has those advanced
capabilities today?'' said Bill Lyons, IBM's vice president for
software marketing.
   For buyers of personal computers, the differences between the
Personal System-2 and the competitors' machines will be hard to
detect, especially within the next few years.
   Canion estimated that 98 percent of programs developed for one
kind of computer would run on the others without modification. The
main exception would be communications software.
   The nine companies agreed to share any patents on the new bus
among themselves and offer free licenses to any other companies
that want to use it. The only charge to companies will be $2,500 to
cover paperwork and lawyers' fees.
   The other eight originators of the standard are Tandy Corp.,
Zenith Data Systems, AST Research Inc.,Wyse Technology,
Hewlett-Packard Co., Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. SpA, and
Japan's NEC Information Systems Inc. and Epson America Inc.
   Other major contributors to the project are Intel Corp. and
Microsoft Corp., which are also major suppliers to IBM, of chips
and software, respectively.
   Ben Rosen, the venture capitalist and chairman of Compaq, said
the coalition of so many rivals was unprecedented: ``It's one of
the major events in the history of the PC industry,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Strengthens Slightly, Gold Is Mixed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened mildly against most key
currencies Tuesday, but money brokers said trading remained light
in advance of the Commerce Department's July trade deficit report.
   Gold was narrowly mixed in New York after rising abroad.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $420.90 a troy
ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down 45 cents from the late Monday price.
   Currency market strategists said the dollar may have received a
slight boost from comments on the nation's trade deficit by
investment banker Nicholas Brady at Senate hearings on his
nomination to be treasury secretary.
   Brady's allusions to the narrowing deficit were interpreted by
some traders as a sign that the Reagan administration was not
overly concerned with the dollar's current level, which took some
selling pressure off the currency.
   Nevertheless, the level of trading remained sluggish due to the
unpredictable market impact of the trade deficit statistics to be
released Wednesday morning.
   The consensus in the currency market is for a deficit of about
$11.5 billion, vs. $12.54 billion for June, but the trade data are
one of the most difficult statistics to predict.
   ``People are very reluctant to do much ahead of that number,''
said James Chorek, a currency analyst at Money Market Services, a
Chicago investment and financial information concern.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 133.07 Japanese yen, down from
133.42 yen Monday. But later in London the dollar rebounded to
133.30 yen, and by the time trading ended in New York, the dollar
strengthened to 133.37 yen, up slightly from 133.35 yen Monday.
   The British pound cost $1.6965 in London late Tuesday, more
expensive than $1.6958 late Monday. In New York the pound weakened
further to $1.6940, vs. $1.6974 late Monday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York vs. levels late Monday:
1.8534 West German marks, up from 1.8464; 1.5609 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5540; 1.2284 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2367; 6.2950
French francs, up from 6.2815; and 1,383.50 Italian lire, up from
1,378.85.
   Late rates in Europe compared with late Monday: 1.8470 West
German marks, up from 1.8453; 1.5600 Swiss francs, up from 1.5535;
6.2935 French francs, up from 6.2775; 2.0845 Dutch guilders, up
from 2.0817; 1,380.50 Italian lire, up from 1,378.50; and 1.2307
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2395.
   Gold bullion prices moved higher abroad in a recovery from low
levels Monday, when the price fell below $420 a troy ounce in
Europe for the first time this year, undermined by weaker prices
for oil and other commodities.
   Gold closed in London at $420, up from $419.25; in Zurich at
$421, up from $418; and in Hong Kong at $422.69, up from $419.18.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
rose 30 cents to $421.50.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.46 a troy ounce, up
from $6.41. On the New York Comex, silver for current delivery rose
4 cents to $6.477.

<DATELINE>CANNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp.'s huge annual
product show opened Tuesday in this French Riviera city, and the
company announced a major new thrust into the business of planning
and managing customers' computer systems.
   The fifth annual DEC World, described by the company as the
world's biggest single-vendor information exhibition, is also the
first of the series to be held outside the United States. Related
exhibitions will start Wednesday in 11 U.S. cities.
   Digital said it would be the only company to help customers at
every stage of their operations, from deciding how to set up
computer networks to overseeing their maintenance once installed.
   The Maynard, Mass.-based computer maker will offer to be the
single point of contact for its customers, although it will
subcontract some of the work to specialists, it said.
   The field being pursued by Digital, known as systems
integration, is one of the fastest-growing segments of the computer
industry and is already being actively pursued by such companies as
International Business Machines Corp., General Motors Corp.'s
Electronic Data Systems, and most of the Big Eight accounting firms.
   In a related announcement, Digital said it had developed a way
for computer users to oversee and manage complex networks of
computers, even ones made by other companies and widely separated
from each other.
   The software that went into the management system was the
biggest software development project Digital has undertaken in the
past decade, aside from improving its own operating system, Jeffrey
Low, a Digital executive, said in an interview in New York.
   Low said seven companies, including Unisys Corp.'s Timeplex
Inc., have already agreed to make modifications that will allow
their software to be controlled by Digital's management system. He
said 100 others have expressed interest in doing the same.
   Digital is the world's second-biggest computer company after IBM.
   The company said DEC World '88 involves more than $65 million
worth of computer equipment, an exhibit space the size of 15 tennis
courts and more than 350 demonstrations at the Palais des Congres
running until Sept. 23.
   The exhibition is expected to attract 18,000 visitors in Cannes
and 5,000 in the United States.
   At Digital's 11 Application Centers for Technology in the United
States, there will be demonstrations similar to those taking place
in Cannes.
   The purpose of DEC World is to show companies how to gain and
keep a competitive advantage by making the most effective use of
the latest information technology.
   The exhibits are arranged by industry and focus on
manufacturing, financial services, the service industries,
tleecommunications and the public sector.

<HEAD>Colgate-Palmolive Subsidiary To Be Sold To Managment Group</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Consumer-products giant Colgate-Palmolive Co.
said Tuesday it accepted a management-led buyout of its Kendall
Health Care subsidiary in a deal that values the business at around
$1.1 billion.
   Under the agreement, Colgate will receive $910 million in cash
and $50 million worth of debentures from a company formed by
Kendall management and the investment banking firm Clayton &
Dublier.
   In addition, Colgate said it would retain certain Kendall
assets, including real estate and some overseas non-health care
consumer products businesses.
   It estimated the entire deal to be worth around $1.1 billion, a
price that was in line with expectations of private industry
analysts.
   Colgate, which put Kendall on the auction block last spring,
said the transaction would result in an after-tax gain of more than
$200 million.
   Colgate Chaiman Reuben Mark said the Kendall sale would enable
the company to focus on its vast array of global consumer products.
   ``It (Kendall) is a fine, well-managed company, but as the
business does not fit in with Colgate's long-term strategic focus,
the sale will enable us to concentrate all of our attention on
worldwide consumer products opportunities,'' Mark said.
   Among Colgate's products are Fresh Start, Fab, Dynamo and Ajax
cleansers; Colgate and Ultra Brite toothpastes, and Irish Spring
and Palmolive soaps.
   Other operations include Princess House crystal and Hill's pet
products.
   The Kendall unit manufactures and supplies disposable medical
products, such as surgical dressing and bandages and intravenous
solutions, to hospitals and health-care facilities in 61 countries.
Its best-known consumer product is its Curity bandage brand.
   Kendall, with more than 10,000 employees worldwide, accounted
for around $850 million of Colgate's $5.6 billion in revenue last
year.
   Clayton & Dubilier is a private New York-based investment firm
that specializes in management-led leveraged buyouts, in which a
company is acquired largely through borrowed money repaid from a
target company's profits or asset sales.

<HEAD>IBM Role Reported in Steve Jobs' New Computer Unveiling</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Deletes reference to Tuesday in lede.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Apple Computer Inc. Chairman
Steven P. Jobs has achieved a coup by reportedly enlisting
International Business Machines Corp. to back Next Inc.'s
long-awaited new computer, analysts say.
   Next has closely guarded the details of the computer, which has
been three years in the making and is scheduled to be unveiled Oct.
12 after repeated delays.
   The New York Times reported Tuesday that IBM is paying $10
million for the right to use the symbols and commands with which
the user will interact with Jobs' new computer.
   Industry executives said IBM plans to use the Jobs technology _
which controls the ``look and feel'' of the machines _ on computers
that run the Unix operating system.
   Jobs has said the Next computer was initially designed for
college students and academic researchers, although analysts said
they now believe he envisions a wider market for the computer.
   Analysts noted that Jobs faces a much tougher environment for
startups than when he founded Apple in nearby Cupertino more than
11 years ago. IBM and Apple have set high computer standards, and
those two companies and Sun Microsystems Inc. have successfully
wooed the specialized academic market for years..
   ``He's got to have something that really sets it apart,
something that lights a fire,'' William Lampesis of Dataquest Inc.
in San Jose said Monday.
   For years, IBM was the major rival of Jobs in efforts to
dominate of the personal computer industry while Jobs headed Apple.
   When he lost a bitter battle three years ago with Apple
president John Sculley and was ousted from the company, Jobs set
out to invent a new personal computer as significant as the Apple
Macintosh.
   The yet-unnamed Next computer is expected to have a number of
features not available on current personal computers, such as a
high-speed facsimile modem, powerful digital sound processing
capabilities, an erasable compact disc player for data storage and
retrieval and the ability to display television-quality video
signals.
   Jobs may face legal obstacles in his effort to establish his new
machine on the market. Apple sued Jobs in 1985 and, as part of a
settlement, won the right to inspect the Next machine for possible
trade secret violations. Apple says Jobs has given only ``partial
compliance.''
   ``We still reserve the right for further evaluation of the
product,'' said Apple spokeswoman Carleen LeVasseur.
   Cathy Cook, Next's spokeswoman, expressed surprise at Apple's
claim, saying she believed Apple had ``signed off on the machine.''
   ``As far as Next is concerned, they've fulfilled everything they
have to do,'' Cook said.
   But Jobs' strong credibility in the industry and the IBM
connection make experts reluctant to say he can't clear the hurdles
ahead of him.
   ``Steve is Steve. Whatever he does is of great interest to
people,'' said Katie Povejsil, academic solutions manager at Apple.
   At universities, she said, ``I get the impression there is a
real wait-and-see attitude. They've been promised a lot, and they'd
like to see the goods.''

   The stock market finished higher Tuesday in
mostly sluggish trading, getting a last-minute boost from remarks
by Treasury secretary designate Nicholas F. Brady.
   The statements touched off a late buying wave led by blue-chip
issues, after stocks had traded slightly lower through most of he
session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended 10.67 points
higher at 2,083.04. The closely watched blue-chip indicator fell
10.31 points soon after the opening, recovered a bit and then
stayed in a narrow range until shortly before the close.
   In the broader market, advancing issues narrowly outnumbered
declines in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 705 issues up, 681 down and 545 unchanged.
   Brady, an investment banker nominated by President Reagan to
replace former Treasury chief James Baker, said at his Senate
confirmation hearing that he expects the nation's trade deficit to
decline at a ``surprisingly fast'' pace over the next few years.
   Analysts said Wall Street interpreted Brady's comments as
hinting that Wednesday's scheduled government report on the
merchandise trade report for July would be encouraging.
   ``I think the comment helped,'' said Ralph Acampora, an analyst
for Kidder, Peabody & Co.
   Brady, who later was approved by the Senate Finance Committee
for consideration by the full Senate, also said he sees no reason
at this time for raising taxes. Brady's nomination is widely
expected to be approved.
   Market activity had been stalled as participants awaited the
July trade report, and Brady's remarks gave the lackluster market a
lift, analysts said. Volume also was dampened, though less so than
on Monday, by the observance of the Jewish New Year holiday.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 162.49 million shares,
up from 114.88 million in Monday's session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
187.86 million shares.
   ``Rip Van Winkle would love this one,'' Bill Raftery, an analyst
at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said early in the session.
``It's like watching paint dry on the walls.''
   Analysts said the overall market was dragged down in the early
going by negative news affecting shares of semiconductor companies,
including National Semiconductor Corp.'s loss of $30.5 million in
its first fiscal quarter.
   ``That sent the whole group into a tailspin,'' said Hildegarde
Zagorski, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Shares of National Semiconductor, one of the most actively
traded companies, fell | to 8{.
   The announcement early Tuesday that the U.S. current-account
deficit shrank by 9.8 percent in the second quarter to $33.3
billion had little impact since it is a less recent reading of the
trade picture than Wednesday's report.
   The NYSE index rose 0.52 to 151.15.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 1.20 to 306.95, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.96 at 267.43.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index edged up
0.12 to 296.79. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 382.38, up 0.31.

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Soar On Hurricane Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cotton futures prices soared Tuesday on the New York Cotton
Exchange on fears that heavy rains from Hurricane Gilbert could
damage the cotton crop in central and western Texas.
   On other markets, prices for future delivery of oil and oil
products, grains, soybeans, copper, gold, silver and livestock all
finished higher. Stock-index futures also advanced.
   Gilbert was heading toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Tuesday
after devastating Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Some cotton
traders feared that strong winds and rain from the savage storm
would reach deep into Texas.
   ``They know it will go into the Gulf of Mexico tomorrow and move
into the south Texas coastal areas,'' said Ernest Simon, cotton
specialist with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Simon said traders feared the storm would strike land between
Tampico, Mexico and Corpus Christi, Texas, turn north and pour rain
on cotton fields in the state's central and western portions.
   If that happens, he said. ``it will lower the grade, it may even
cause some loss.''
   Despite the heavy buying prompted by Gilbert's approach, Simon
said the loss of even 500,000 bales of cotton would have little
impact on the glutted cotton market.
   Earlier this week, the Agriculture Department estimated that
stocks of cotton next July 31, the end of the current marketing
year, would total 8.2 million bales compared with 5.6 million bales
at the end of the 1987-88 year.
   ``If this storm does something, it is meaningless in the overall
context of the cotton crop we have,'' said Simon. ``We still have a
huge surplus of cotton.''
   Cotton settled 1.24 cents to 1.55 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in October at 55.49 cents a pound.
   Fears that Gilbert could force a temporary halt to gasoline
production at oil refineries in the Gulf helped spur energy futures
to higher levels on the New York Mercantile Exchange, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 12 cents
higher with October at $14.56 a barrel; heating oil was .12 cent to
.15 cent higher with October at 41.83 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .02 cent to 1.19 cents higher with October at 43.81
cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices finished mostly higher on the
Chicago Board of Trade as strength from the buoyant wheat market
spilled over into the corn and soybean pits.
   Corn and soybean futures had opened lower in reaction to
higher-than-expected harvest estimates for those crops contained in
an Agriculture Department report released Monday.
   The USDA's wheat production estimate also was higher than
expected but wheat futures prices rallied on the report's
predictions of declining Soviet and Canadian wheat production and
increasing Soviet grain imports, analysts said.
   With potential crop-weather problems developing in South America
and severe crop losses a hard fact in the United States and Canada,
``the world situation is still tight'' said Ted Mao, grain
specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Wheat settled 3 cents to 9} cents higher with September at $4.11
a bushel; corn was { cent lower to 3 cents higher with September at
$2.85{ a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with September
at $2.65 a bushel; soybeans were 5{ cents to 11 cents higher with
September at $8.76 a bushel.
   Copper contracts for near-term delivery advanced for the sixth
straight day on New York's Commodity Exchange in response to
continued strong demand and tightening supplies, analysts said.
   ``There is a legitimate shortage of high-grade copper and
indications you really are running into a supply-demand
imbalance,'' said David Syphen, manager of the metals futures desk
of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York.
   Copper settled .60 cent to 2.20 cents higher with September at
$1.0890 a pound.
   Precious-metals futures also gained modestly on the Comex, with
silver's relative gains outpacing gold's.
   Gold settled 10 cents to 30 cents higher with October at $422.90
a troy ounce; silver was 4 cents to 4.5 cents higher with September
at $6.477 a troy ounce.
   Most livestock and meat futures rallied on the Chicago

   Kroger Co. said Tuesday it was considering a
$3.77 billion restructuring plan, but said the proposal was not
specifically designed to ward off a possible hostile takeover bid
by Herbert and Robert Haft.
   Kroger, one of the nation's largest grocery chains, said it was
asking its board of directors to approve a plan that would plunge
the company into debt but keep it publicly owned. Kroger has 1,300
supermarkets and other operations in 29 states.
   The announcement sent Kroger stock soaring $11.75 a share to
$51.25 in nationwide trading of issues listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   A Federal Trade Commission ruling on Friday allowed the Hafts to
acquire at least $15 million worth of Kroger stock. The Hafts, who
control Dart Group Corp. of Landover, Md., are corporate takeover
strategists and have unsuccessfully chased other supermarket chains
but made huge profits in the process.
   ``This restructuring is not specifically tailored to the Haft
situation,'' Kroger spokesman Paul Bernish said. ``We take it
seriously. But ever since the market became competitive in 1985 or
1986, we've been pretty vigilant about this. We want to keep Kroger
an independent and public company.''
   Kroger said the restructuring would involve substantial but
unspecified bank loans, paying shareholders $48 in cash and
securities per share and allowing them to keep their stock. Kroger
has about 78.57 million shares outstanding.
   Kroger said it will repay the loans using cash flow from
operations, reducing expenses and selling assets. In a 1986
restructuring, Kroger sold its chain of SupeRx retail drugstores,
and Kroger has worked since July to sell off its unprofitable chain
of Florida Choice supermarkets and liquor stores in Florida.
   ``This is a case of extending that process,'' Bernish said.
``Our review of assets will be heightened if this plan is
approved.''
   The FTC ruling was the first official sign of the Hafts'
interest in Kroger. Representatives of the Hafts declined to
comment.
   Supermarket industry analysts said the restructuring plan was a
positive step for Kroger.
   ``This has been an option for Kroger for a long time. It is not
necessarily a response to the Haft announcement, but the Haft
family move was a catalyst,'' said Elizabeth Shiels, analyst for
the investment firm Hilliard Lyons in Louisville, Ky.
   ``Kroger has been looking for ways to reward its stockholders,''
she said. ``This restructuring allows the company to stay public
... This is a prudent move for Kroger.''
   Kroger's stock has traded heavily over the past five months,
partly because of rumors the Hafts and other potential acquirers
were interested in the company.
   If the Hafts were to take over Kroger, ``It's almost certain
that they'll start dismantling the company and selling off its
assets,'' said Gary M. Giblen, vice president at Rotan-Mosle, a
Houston-based investment firm.
   But Giblen also said the Hafts may be serious about running a
grocery company.
   They demonstrated that earlier this spring when they bought a
small Washington, D.C., grocery chain. Instead of selling it off
for the cash, the Hafts are using the company to learn how to
manage a grocery firm, Giblen said.
   The Hafts have failed in their efforts to buy such companies as
Safeway Stores Inc., Supermarkets General Corp. and Stop & Shop
Cos. but have profited in selling stock back to those companies.

   Woodworkers have ratified a new four-year
contract with Weyerhaeuser Co., a union spokesman said Tuesday.
   About 6,000 union woodworkers in Oregon and Washington approved
the pact, said Chuck MacRae, vice president of the International
Woodworkers of America-U.S.
   Weyerhaeuser's contract with the IWA and the Western Council of
Industrial Workers is nearly identical to contracts negotiated with
Boise-Cascade Corp., Willamette Industries Inc., Simpson Timber Co.
and Champion International Corp., MacRae said.
   It provides for a $1,400 bonus in the first year of the
contract, plus wage increases totaling 11 percent over the next
three years, he said. It allows a week's vacation bonus in the
first year, plus two additional holidays and substantial pension
plan improvements, MacRae said.
   Weyerhaeuser operations were not affected during the summer-long
Northwest woodworkers' strike. Most of the struck companies have
settled, and only about 400 workers remain on strike at two small
mills in Oregon.
   On Monday, about 1,300 woodworkers ratified a four-year contract
with DAW Forest Products Co. and W-I Forest Products Inc.
   At one point, the strike idled 9,000 workers in five states.

   Shamrock, based in Burbank, Calif., has offered to buy Polaroid

   Last month, Polaroid's board of directors unanimously rejected
as inadequate an unsolicited offer from Shamrock that would have
paid $40 a share plus a share plus 40 pecent of the eventual award
in Polaroid's patent infringement lawsuit against Eastman Kodak Co.
   A percentage of that potential settlement was not included in
the new hostile tender offer of $42 a share.

<TEXT>
   The Bass investment group is seeking a partner
to finance part of its planned acquisition of American Savings &
Loan Association, according to the federal official overseeing a $2
billion government bailout of the thrift.
   The Robert M. Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas, is negotiating
with at least three companies as it seeks a partner, said M. Danny
Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Wall, whose comments outside a savings and loan group's meeting
here were reported Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal, did not
respond to a telephone request for comment.
   Wall did not reveal the identities of the potential partners
except to say they were financial services companies. They were not
federally insured banks or savings and loan institutions, he said.
   The Bass Group, which will gain control of American in exchange
for an injection of $550 million, can sell as much as 49 percent of
the recapitalized American to a partner approved by the bank board,
Wall said.
   The bank board, which will own 30 percent of American, has
pledged an estimated $2 billion in cash and promissory notes over
the next 10 years to rescue the insolvent institution.
   The bank board seized Stockton-based American last week as a
prelude to turning it over the Bass. American's 186 California
branches remain open, and federal insurance remains in force for
all deposits.
   Financial Corp. of America, the holding company for American,
filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy code last week.

<TEXT>
   Peace in Britain's two-week Post Office strike
appeared in the balance Tuesday night as thousands of workers
stayed off the job despite Monday's settlement of the dispute.
   It was still impossible to post a letter in London where mail
boxes remained sealed.
   The Post Office said work had begun on clearing 150 million
letters and packages backed up in the system. Although it expected
a full return to work by Thursday, the Post Office said it could be
two weeks before service was restored to normal.
   As night shifts began, it estimated that 20,000 of the 100,000
strikers had returned to work. It said another 40,000 worked during
the strike.
   Tuffin, general secretary of the Union of Communication Workers,
said agreement was reached Monday on the issue of regional pay
bonuses but the key issue of whether union members would allow
casual workers to handle the mail backlog had been left to local
negotiations.
   He said the union would back members remaining on strike if they
could not agree terms on casual labor and overtime with Post Office
local managers.
   The union said half the country's 15,000 sorting offices were
still on strike and only six of the 82 major sorting centers were
working. It said staff at Glasgow, York and Hull had voted to stay
out and similar decisions were expected at other offices.
   The strike began as a 24-hour walkout on Aug. 31 against the
Post Office desire to pay bonuses to new workers in London and
southeast England where the cost of living is high and retaining
workers difficult. The union wanted the bonuses paid nationally.
   Strikes mushroomed Sept. 1 when the Post Office tried to bring
in workers to clear the mail backlog.
   Tuffin said Monday the bonus system had been accepted until a
new one could be worked out in about six weeks.

<TEXT>
   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
trade narrowed sharply from April through June as overseas sales of
American merchandise surged to a record high, the government
reported Tuesday.
   However, the good news was tempered by the fact that America
suffered its first deficit in three decades in the trade category
which includes investment earnings.
   The Commerce Department said the deficit in the current account
shrank to $33.3 billion in the second quarter, a 9.8 percent
improvement from a first quarter imbalance of $36.9 billion. It was
the biggest quarterly improvement since a 20.1 percent drop in the
final three months of last year.
   The current account is the most important of all the
government's trade statistics because it covers not only trade in
merchandise but also trade in services, which primarily reflect the
flow of investment earnings between countries.
   The improvement in the second quarter current account deficit
occurred because the deficit in merchandise trade fell to $29.9
billion, down from $35.2 billion in the first quarter, as exports
rose to a record level and imports posted the first quarterly
decline in three years.
   This improvement was offset by a $492 million imbalance in
services, which meant that foreigners earned more on their
investments during the quarter than Americans earned on overseas
investments.
   Also adding to the current account deficit was $2.9 billion in
U.S. payments for foreign aid and pensions to Americans living
overseas.
   For the first six months of this year, the current account
deficit has been running at an annual rate of $140.5 billion, a
substantial improvement from a record deficit of $154 billion in
1987.
   The improvement has come about because of a boom in U.S.
exports, reflecting declines in the value of the dollar since 1985
which have made American goods competitive once again on overseas
markets.
   The export rebound has translated into hefty job gains in
American manufacturing which the Reagan administration hopes will
benefit Republican George Bush's presidential chances.
   However, Democrat Michael Dukakis has charged that the surge in
trade deficits this decade and the resulting growth in foreign debt
is one of the major failures of the Reagan economic program.
   The current account was last in surplus in 1981, a year in which
Americans' earnings on overseas investments were enough to offset a
deficit in merchandise trade.
   Since that time, Americans have handed over billions of dollars
to foreigners in exchange for imported goods, transforming the
country from the world's largest creditor nation to the world's
largest debtor country.
   That means that foreigners now own more in U.S. investments than
Americans hold in foreign investments.
   This transfer of wealth was reflected in the second quarter
deficit in the services category, the first deficit in this
category since 1958.
   The services deficit is small enough that it could be revised
away in future reports. Three months ago, the government said that
the services category posted a deficit of $655 million in the first
quarter. That was revised in Tuesday's report to show a surplus of
$1.4 billion.
   But economists said the trend is clear. With foreign holdings in
the United States rising rapidly, the investment category will soon
turn negative and will stay in the red for some time.
   The congressional Joint Economic Committee held a hearing on the
trade deficits Tuesday and heard a panel of economists urge further
action to cut federal budget deficits as a way of slowing U.S.
domestic demand and further reducing the trade deficit.
   The current account deficit is directly linked to the growth of
foreign ownership of U.S. assets because it shows how much we have
borrowed from abroad to finance our trade deficit.
   At the end of 1987, America's net debtor position stood at
$368.2 billion.
   Nigel Gault, senior economist at Data Resources Inc., told the
committee that he estimates America's foreign debt burden will top
$500 billion this year and will approach $2 trillion by the year
1995.
   Economists have warned that as more and more money is
transferred into foreign hands to service America's debt, it will
mean a lower standard of living for Americans.
   ``Our foreign debt is growing at the rate of approximately
$200,000 per minute,'' said Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md. and chairman
of the economic committee. ``Our status as a debtor nation has
profound implications for the domestic economy. It affects
employment prospects, the financial markets, the value of the
dollar and vital sectors of the economy, such as housing, which
depend on long-term credit.''
   The administration, however, has played down the significance of
the record increase in foreign investment in this country,
contending the debt servicing is still a tiny fraction of the
country's overall gross national product.
   The government will release Wednesday a report on the
merchandise trade deficit for July with many economists predicting
that the imbalance will decline slightly to $11.5 billion, down $1
billion from the June deficit.

   The government reported on Tuesday a sharp improvement in the
broadest measure of U.S. trade from April through June, while
stocks got a boost from predictions that the trade deficit would
continue to decline.
   The Commerce Department said the deficit in the current account
shrank to $33.3 billion in the second quarter, a 9.8 percent
improvement from a first quarter imbalance of $36.9 billion. It was
the biggest quarterly improvement since a 20.1 percent drop in the
final three months of last year.
   The current account covers not only trade in merchandise but
also trade in services, which primarily reflect the flow of
investment earnings between countries.
   On Wednesday, the government will report the merchandise trade
balance for July, a monthly figure watched closely by the financial
markets.
   The Dow Jones industrial average spurted ahead in late trading
Tuesday, encouraged by remarks from Treasury secretary designate
Nicholas F. Brady, who said at his Senate confirmation hearing that
he expects the trade deficit to decline at a surprisingly fast pace
over the next few years.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks ended 10.67 points
higher at 2,083.04 after a mostly lackluster session.
   Brady, an investment banker who investigated the causes of last
year's stock market crash, was nominated by President Reagan to
replace former Treasury chief James A. Baker III.
   In other markets, the dollar strengthened slightly, but activity
was slow in advance of the July trade figures. Bond prices gained
as the yield on the government's 30-year issue slipped below 9
percent.
   Oil prices advanced, driven by a rise in wholesale gasoline
prices, which soared on news that refineries and oil platforms were
threatened by a hurricane approaching the Gulf of Mexico. The
contract for October delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 7 cents to settle at $14.56 a
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Wholesale
unleaded gasoline for October delivery closed up 1.19 cents at
43.81 cents a gallon.
   The government's trade report showed the second-quarter
improvement in the current account deficit occurred because the
deficit in merchandise trade fell to $29.9 billion, down from $35.2
billion in the first quarter, as exports rose to a record level and
imports posted the first quarterly decline in three years.
   The good news was tempered by the fact that America suffered its
first deficit in three decades in the category that includes
investment earnings. The report showed a $492 million imbalance in
services, meaning that foreigners earned more on their investments
during the quarter than Americans earned on overseas investments.
   Still, for the first six months of this year, the current
account deficit has been running at an annual rate of $140.5
billion, a substantial improvement from a record deficit of $154
billion in 1987.
   The improvement has come about because of a boom in U.S.
exports, reflecting declines in the value of the dollar since 1985
which have made American goods competitive once again on overseas
markets.
   Also on Tuesday, the congressional Joint Economic Committee
heard a panel of economists urge further action to cut federal
budget deficits as a way of slowing U.S. domestic demand and
further reducing the trade deficit.
   In other economic news, the government released a state-by-state
report on unemployment in which Vermont emerged as the best job
provider for its residents. Massachusetts slipped from first place
to 10th in the past year among states with the lowest unemployment
rates.

   A federal judge on Tuesday accepted most
of an $8.75 million jury award to a Minnesota woman in her suit
against G.D. Searle & Co., manufacturer of the Copper-7
intrauterine device that she said left her sterile.
   Judge Robert Renner, however, lowered the emotional distress
award given Esther Kociemba from $1 million to $400,000, based on
state law limiting recovery for intangible losses, including
emotional distress, to $400,000.
   Renner said the damage awards for pain and suffering and
punitive damages would remain.
   The jury of five women and three men returned the verdict last
Friday after 10 days of deliberations that began after a 14-week
trial. They awarded Mrs. Kociemba, 30, of Elk River $7 million in
punitive damages, $1 million for emotional distress and $750,000
for pain and disability.
   The jury found the birth control device was not properly tested
and that Illinois-based Searle, a subsidiary of Monsanto Co.,
failed to warn about risks and intentionally misrepresented the
Copper-7.
   But the jury also found that Searle was not negligent in the
design or manufacture of the Copper-7.
   Renner could have declared that the jury's decision was improper
and declare a mistrial.
   Kay Bruno, a spokeswoman at Searle headquarters in Skokie, Ill.,
said company attorneys were preparing briefs to be submitted Oct. 4
on a motion to dismiss the verdict and request a new trial.
   Bruno said oral arguments would be presented after attorneys had
a chance to review the briefs. ``The appeal will take place after
the post-trial activities, and we do anticipate being successful on
appeal,'' Bruno said.
   Roger Brosnahan, one of Mrs. Kociemba's attorneys, said last
Friday the case marked the first time a jury had awarded punitive
damages against Searle for a Copper-7-related illness and also was
the largest award.
   About 500 suits have been filed over the Copper-7, the most
widely used IUD in the United States before it was withdrawn from
the U.S. market in January 1986 in the midst of litigation.
   Mrs. Kociemba had sought $15 million in punitive damages, $1.5
million to $2 million in compensatory damages and $300,000 in
compensatory damages for her husband, William. The jury declined to
award William Kociemba any money for loss of consortium as a direct
result of his wife's use of the Copper-7.
   Some 500 lawsuits have been filed over the Copper-7, once the
most widely used IUD in the United States before it was withdrawn
from the U.S. market in January 1986.
   Searle won 14 of the previous 17 cases to be decided, but
Kociemba lawyers have said that none of the previous cases included
as many documents or deposition testimony as this one.
   Mrs. Kociemba used a Copper-7 for just under 1{ years in 1977
and 1978. She claimed the IUD triggered a pelvic infection two
weeks after insertion and that the infection scarred her fallopian
tubes, leaving her sterile.

<TEXT>
   Ecuador plans to seek an increase in its
OPEC production quota, Energy Minister Diego Tamariz said Tuesday,
noting that government budget plans did not account for the recent
decline in world oil prices.
   Tamariz said the average price Ecuador gets for its oil has been
ranging between $11.88 and $ll.55 a barrel, while the government's
budget was calculated on an estimate of $17 a barrel.
   ``There is a certain weakness in the petroleum market that has
accentuated in recent days, with a declining tendency,'' Tamariz
said in a news conference.
   Ecuador is one of the smallest producers among the 13 members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, although oil
provides more than half of its export earnings.
   The energy minister said Ecuador planned to ask OPEC to increase
its production quota from 210,000 barrels daily to between 300,000
and 310,000 barrels.
   Ecuador currently produces 310,000 barrels a day with special
permission from OPEC, which ends this month. OPEC approved the
temporary increase in Ecuador's production after the country
suffered devastating economic damage from earthquakes in March 1987.
   Tamariz said the market was unstable because of peace
negotiations between Iran and Iraq, which are among the world's
major oil producers.
   Overall OPEC production in August was estimated at 20 million
barrels a day, nearly 3.5 million barrels over its self-imposed
output ceiling. The world oil glut, plus speculation that the
cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war could bring even higher production,
has helped depress prices below OPEC's benchmark of $18 a barrel.
   In addition to Ecuador, the United Arab Emirates is seeking a
higher quota. The U.A.E. has refused to accept a quota of 948,000
barrels a day and demanded a 1.5 million-barrel quota, roughly the
level of its current production.

   A defendant utility in the Washington
Public Power Supply System fraud trial settled its share of the
case for $6.5 million in an agreement announced late Tuesday, the
day before opening arguments were set to begin in federal court.
   The settlement by Washington's Clallam County Public Utility
District left 19 other defendants, including 16 utilities, to stand
trial in the fraud suit stemming from the biggest municipal bond
default ever.
   Settlements so far total more than $353 million and have
included more than 70 utilities and Wall Street firms that handled
WPPSS bond sales. Plaintiffs also have assumed rights to disputed
insurance claims that could yield another $92 million.
   Opening trial statements were expected to last through Thursday.
The first witness is expected to take the stand Monday.
   Bondholders originally sued more than 100 parties in the case,
which grew out of WPPSS' 1983 default on $2.25 billion worth of
bonds sold to finance construction on two never-finished nuclear
power plants, WPPSS Nos. 4 and 5.
   The defendants have denied the claims of fraud, arguing that
poor judgment may have been a factor but WPPSS and defendant
utilities acted in what they believed were the best interests of
the Northwest's energy needs.
   In addition to the 16 utilities, which were both WPPSS board
members and participants in building plants 4 and 5, remaining
defendants include two engineering firms and a financial adviser to
the supply system.
   Mel Weiss, an attorney for plaintiff WPPSS bond buyers, said
Clallam County PUD would pay $6 million cash, and another $521,750
would come from its insuror. Clallam PUD commissioners still must
formally approve the settlement, Weiss said.
   Officials of the Port Angeles, Wash.-based utility were not
immediately available for comment.
   ``This is a significant settlement in that it's a first with a
member that's (basically) uninsured,'' said Weiss.
   ``It shows the utilities can raise significant amounts of money
without insurance,'' he said.
   The Clallam PUD settlement also could indicate what the entire
WPPSS suit might be settled for. Weiss said Clallam PUD paid $4.75
million per percentage point of its 1.4 percent interest in two
WPPSS nuclear plants.
   The 16 remaining utilities contracted for about 63 percent of
the plants' expected output, so a final settlement could total
about $300 million.
   Settlement talks have been conducted in secrecy, so it is
unknown which defendants are negotiating

<HEAD>Wickes Adopts Temporary Shareholder Protection Plan</HEAD>

   Wickes Companies Inc. has adopted a
temporary shareholder protection plan that requires potential
buyers to keep any offers open through late October, a spokesman
said Tuesday.
   The plan is meant to ``assure shareholders get the best value
possible,'' said Wickes spokesman Steve Stern.
   A management group led by Wickes Chairman Sanford Sigoloff has
offered to buy the company for $12 a share in a $598 million
leveraged buyout.
   Wickes' stock closed at $13.62{, down unchanged from Monday's
close on the New York Stock Exchange.
   That plan included a 60-day wait before the group could begin
buying shares, in order to give other buyers a chance to emerge.
Sigoloff, who led Wickes out of bankruptcy proceedings 3{ years
ago, said earlier the management group would not begin buying
shares until Oct. 20.
   The protection plan requires potential buyers keep their offers
open through Oct. 20, Stern said, adding the plan was not intended
to impede any other offers for Wickes shares.
   The buyout offer has brought numerous inquiries from other
buyers, according to Michael Tennenbaum, senior managing director
at Bear Stearns & Co. Inc., which is advising Wickes management.
   A buyer of Wickes would have to assume $2.1 billion in debt.
   The company's main lines of business are industrial products,
including auto fabrics and aircraft and missile parts; home
improvement and furnishings, including Wickes Furniture and
Builders Emporium do-it-yourself stores in Southern California; and
a group that makes wallpaper and carpet.
