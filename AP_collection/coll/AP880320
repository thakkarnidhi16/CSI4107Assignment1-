   A bid to forge a united opposition to
President Roh Tae-woo collapsed Monday because of violence between
supporters of the two political groups meeting to discuss a merger.
   The nation's two main opposition parties, controlled by rivals
Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, blamed each other for the collapse.
   Both parties said Monday there was no chance of reuniting before
National Assembly elections next month and they would mount
separate election campaigns. In other developments, North Korea
announced Monday its armed forces have gone into a state of
``combat mobilization.'' It was the fifth time since 1983 that
North Korea has issued such a order to coincide with annual
U.S.-South Korean military exercises.
   In Seoul, the Agency for National Security Planning announced
Monday that it had cracked an anti-U.S., pro-North Korean
underground student ring. It said the group backed planned bombings
at U.S. Information Service buildings in Seoul and Kwangju last
month.
   The agency said seven members of the group have been arrested
and 60 members were at large.
   The Reunification Democratic Party said it was abandoning
efforts to unite the opposition after attacks Sunday by members of
the smaller Party for Peace and Democracy.
   ``The party concluded it would be meaningless and impossbile to
continue merger talks because the positions between the parties are
so wide apart,'' said Kim Pae-ryong, a RDP spokesman.
   ``This shows the RDP was not sincere,'' said Ahn Dong-sun, a
spokesman for Kim Dae-jung's Party for Peace and Democracy.
   About 250 Party for Peace members and supporters occupied the
main lobby of a Seoul hotel where merger talks that began Friday
were to have resumed Saturday.
   The protesters kicked and punched Reunification negotiators,
calling them ``betrayers'' and ``swindlers.'' A Reunification
Democratic Party negotiator was slightly injured. A television
cameraman was beaten and taken to a nearby hospital.
   The Reunification party negotiators called off the talks but
were barred from leaving the hotel until after midnight. Another
round of talks was called at a different hotel early Sunday
morning, but the Reunificaton officials refused to attend.
   The two opposition parties have been bitter rivals since Kim
Dae-jung and his supporters split from Kim Young-sam's party and
both Kims ran in the December presidential race.
   The two Kims split 55 percent of the opposition vote in the
presidential elections, giving the victory to Roh, who won without
a majority.

   Vice President George Bush won
Puerto Rico's Republican primary Sunday and added another 14
national convention delegates to his tally, while Jesse Jackson won
the Democrats' non-binding ``beauty contest'' balloting.
   With nearly a third of the precincts reporting, Bush was picking
up 97 percent of the vote, while GOP rival Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas
was receiving just 3 percent.
   Counting was proceding slowly, but Puerto Rico GOP Chairman Luis
Ferre said, ``Bush has the 14 delegates.''
   With results from 28 percent of the precincts, Bush had 1,907
votes, while Dole had 48.
   Republican returns were sparse because the vast majority of
voters turned out for the Democratic primary.
   On the Democratic side, with 31 percent of the precincts
reporting, Jackson led with 25,971 votes, or 35 percent, followed
by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis with 17,023 for 23 percent,
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon with 14,870 votes for 20 percent,
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore with 13,210 for 18 percent, and Missouri
Rep. Richard Gephardt with 2,707 for 4 percent.
   The Democratic primary had no effect on who won delegates to the
national convention. The 51 delegates at stake Sunday were expected
to go uncommitted to the convention. In all, Puerto Rico will send
56 delegates to the convention, including the governor and four
other party leaders, who automatically receive seats as delegates.
   One million Puerto Ricans were expected to vote Sunday in
Democratic and Republican presidential primaries that also are a
test of strength between the two main political parties on this
Caribbean island and U.S. commonwealth.
   The 33 delegates being elected Sunday will choose the leaders of
the local Democratic Party, in addition to choosing the remaining
18 members of the delegation. The delegation was expected to vote
as a bloc at the convention.
   Both the Popular Democratic Party of Gov. Raphael Hernandez
Colon and the out-of-power New Progressive Party of ex-Gov. Carlos
Romero Barcelo want to control the local party so as to better
influence federal legislation, patronage and the debate on Puerto
Rico's political status.
   The NPP wants Puerto Rico to become the 51st U.S. state. The PDP
wants things to remain as they are _ with Puerto Ricans as U.S.
citizens with almost every right and obligation except they cannot
vote for president in the general election and do not pay federal
taxes.
   As the returns came in Sunday the PDP claimed it would win at
least 29 of the 33 delegates being elected directly in the primary,
and launched a noisy celebration.
   Romero Barcelo acknowledged defeat for his NPP, although he did
not specify the margin for the loss.
   ``We lost today but we will continue fighting for political
liberty and economic opportunity,'' Romero Barcelo said. ``There's
nothing to be ashamed of.''
   On Saturday, both local parties organized miles-long caravans of
supporters. PDP partisans waved their red and white banners of a
peasant wearing a straw hat. NPP supporters draped from cars and
trucks their banners showing a blue palm tree.
   For Romero Barcelo, a victory by the NPP slate of 33 delegates,
which he heads, would have raised his chances to win his party's
June 12 gubernatorial primary against San Juan Mayor Baltasar
Corrada del Rio.
   At a separate rally, Hernandez Colon called on his supporters to
vote for the PDP slate ``to bury the body of Carlos Romero
Barcelo.'' Hernandez Colon edged Romero Barcelo in the 1984
gubernatorial election, having lost similar head-to-head contests
in 1980 and 1976.
   Acting to forestall trouble, the police department canceled days
off and vacations, and stationed 3,000 officers at or near polling
stations and party offices. The sale of alcoholic beverages was
prohibited from midnight Saturday to Sunday night.
   An elderly man at a polling station near the poor San Jose
housing complex outside the capital's Hato Rey banking district
said he was not at all interested in the primary and did not intend
to vote.
   ``This primary is like chicken and rice (a popular Puerto Rican
dish) without spices,'' he said, declining to give his name. ``It
has no interest for me. It's a North American thing.''
   In 1980, the Republican presidential primary was held two weeks
before the Democratic primary, and NPP voters cast ballots first
for George Bush, a longtime proponent of statehood for Puerto Rico,
and then for Jimmy Carter. The PDP supported Edward Kennedy.

   McDonald's is recruiting in a
working-class area for employees at a restaurant in this affluent
community 70 miles to the north.
   Radio commercials last week urged bilingual job-seekers to apply
for the openings here at a Hialeah McDonald's. Workers would be
bused to and from Palm Beach County, with the travel time counted
as work hours.
   ``It's just an extension of our age-old tradition of always
trying new, creative ways to staff our stores,'' said Les Lucas,
McDonald's regional personnel manager. He declined to give details
about the program, including why the company was seeking bilingual
workers.
   Bill Hutchinson, a senior economist with the consulting firm of
CH2M Hill, which recently completed an economic study of the
county, said people who would work at McDonald's can't afford to
live here.
   And John Rosenbaum, a work-study coordinator at Boca Raton High
School, said Boca Raton teen-agers consider a $4.50-an-hour job at
McDonald's ``a little beneath them.''

<TEXT>
   Any way you slice it, Lucille and Glenn
Stafford have an unusual recipe for extinguishing car fires _ milk
and bread.
   Mrs. Stafford said experience with South Dakota winters caused
her to buy an extra gallon of milk and a loaf of bread during a
March 3 trip to town ``just in case of an emergency.''
   The emergency came, but it wasn't the late-winter blizzard she
anticipated.
   The Staffords were heading home late at night when ``suddenly we
saw a flame flickering in the heater vent,'' she said.
   ``The car was filled with black smoke and ... fumes,'' she
added. ``The flames were rapidly melting the instrument panel. I
thought we might be asphyxiated. We stopped as quickly as we
could.''
   They were 14 miles from home and about a mile from the nearest
farmhouse. They had no flashlight and no fire extinguisher, and no
other cars were in sight on the country road.
   ``We remembered the gallon of milk and loaf of bread,'' Mrs.
Stafford said. ``We subdued the flame with the milk then stuffed
the hole in the panel with the bread saturated in milk.
   ``We used almost the whole gallon of milk and there were just a
few slices of bread left.''
   The milk-bread solution eased the smoke enough so the couple
could make it back to town to get help.
   ``A short in the light switch caused the blaze,'' she said.
``The car has been fixed and everything has been taken care of. Now
we just have to clean the interior.''

<HEAD>Tiny Portion of AIDS Virus Coat May Hold Key to Vaccine,
Researcher Says

<TEXT>
   Scientists have identified a tiny
portion of the AIDS virus outer coat as a potentially promising
target for an AIDS vaccine, a researcher says.
   ``We think this is the Achille's heel of the virus,'' Scott
Putney of Repligen Corp., of Cambridge, Mass., said in an interview
Sunday.
   The site constitutes less than 3 percent of the overall virus
coat, but studies suggest it acts as a dominant spur to making the
immune system try to fight the virus, he said.
   Putney told science writers at a conference sponsored by the
American Cancer Society that the fragment appears on glycoprotein
120, the sugar-and-protein outer coating of the virus.
   The coating is one target the immune system attacks when it
tries to fight the virus causing acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. The body makes proteins called antibodies that fit
precisely to portions of the virus as part of the attack.
   The idea of a vaccine is to spur the body into creating the
right kind of antibodies ahead of time, so they are lying in wait
when the virus shows up. A vaccine acts as sort of a template
against which the body makes those antibodies.
   Researchers are trying to find the right portion of the AIDS
virus to use in a vaccine, to make the body create effective swarms
of antibodies. Several teams are studying different portions of the
viral coat.
   Two experimental AIDS vaccines are being tested in humans, but
Putney said his work has not advanced far enough for that step.
   The glycoprotein is made up of a long series of molecules called
amino acids. The fragment Putney is focusing on is 24 amino acids
long.
   Research in chimps and humans shows this stretch is a key target
for several kinds of so-called neutralizing antibodies the body
makes against the virus coating and the virus as a whole, he said.
   Neutralizing antibodies are those that can block virus infection
of a cell.
   ``Our vaccine development studies are now vigorously pursuing
these 24 amino acids,'' he said.
   Evidence suggest that antibodies against that fragment may not
only block infection by the virus, but also the merging of infected
cells with uninfected ones, which kills uninfected cells, he said.
   AIDS leaves the body open to fatal diseases by killing key cells
of the immune system.
   At least two basic hurdles stand in the way of basing a vaccine
on the glycoprotein fragment, Putney said.
   One is that the fragment is highly variable, with different
versions appearing in different samples of the AIDS virus, he said.
   It can vary by 40 percent to 50 percent between two samples of
the virus, he said. That means that a vaccine based on the fragment
from one virus strain would not work against other strains.
   So researchers are considering a ``cocktail vaccine'' based on
multiple versions of the variable region, aimed at being effective
against multiple strains of the AIDS virus, he said.
   Putney noted that the polio vaccine is similarly designed to
work against three different strains of that virus.
   Nobody knows how many versions of the fragment would have to be
included in an AIDS vaccine, Putney said, but ``we're hoping it's
between five to 10.'' If it were as high as 100, a cocktail vaccine
would probably not work, he said.
   A second problem is finding a way to spur high enough
concentrations of antibodies against the fragment to prevent AIDS
virus infection, he said. Concentrations seen so far are too low,
he said.
   Putney said he hopes experiments in chimpanzees can begin in a
few months.
   The glycoprotein fragment, called RP135, also has been
identified and studied by scientists at Duke University in Durham,
N.C., at the National Cancer Institute and at the University of
Amsterdam in Holland, Putney said. Results are in the process of
being published, he said.

<TEXT>
   The hometown crowd gushed with praise
Saturday after the local premiere of the Robert Redford-directed
``The Milagro Beanfield War.'' And he returned the compliment,
saying the real star of the movie is ``the people of New Mexico.''
   Residents of Truchas, Santa Fe and Taos and surrounding areas,
who worked on both sides of the camera during the 1986 filming,
exulted after the first of four benefit screenings Saturday to
raise funds for local non-profit organizations.
   Redford, co-producer as well as director of the film, welcomed
the crowd by urging them not to be distracted by the details, but
to ``go with the experience.''
   ``There's no real star of this film, but the star is the people
of New Mexico,'' said Redford, whose only other Hollywood directing
credit, ``Ordinary People,'' earned him an Oscar. ``It could not
have been made if it wasn't for you people.''
   Some locals said they had had reservations about the film,
fearing the simple life of a northern New Mexico native would be
misrepresented, but that their fears had been unfounded.
   ``It's better than I expected it to be,'' said Pablo Trujillo of
Taos, who plays a member of the ``senile brigade,'' a group of old
men who come to the aid of the film's protagonist, handyman Joe
Mondragon, when he uses a ich developer's water to grow pinto beans
in an abandoned field.
   The movie is based on a 1974 novel by John Nichols, a veteran of
land and water-rights disputes in Taos similar to the one portrayed
in the film. Nichols co-wrote the screenplay but didn't see the
film for the first time until Saturday.
   ``It's a very sweet, very gentle, quite magical movie, and I'm
real proud of it,'' Nichols said afterward. ``I think the people
who worked on it should be quite proud of it also.''
   The film stars Chick Vennera as the handyman, and also features
sultry Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, who starred in ``Kiss of the
Spider Woman''; Richard Bradford; and Latin pop musician Ruben
Blades.

   Crews safely removed seven
chemical-filled containers near a flaming and potentially explosive
canister in the ruins of a burned chemical plant Saturday, clearing
the way for nearly 1,500 evacuees to return home.
   The burning, gas-filled container was found Friday in the Gollob
Analytical Services chemical plant, where an explosion and fire
killed three men Thursday and severely injured a fourth. A canister
that had been sent to the plant for analysis caused the explosion,
and authorities say it may have been mislabeled or contaminated.
   In Pocatello, Idaho, meanwhile, a semiconductor plant that may
contain a similar canister was also evacuated Saturday, as was a
nearby nursing home.
   New Jersey authorities, fearing that the burning container that
was discovered Friday might ignite surrounding ones, called for a
half-mile evacuation around the ruined plant Friday night.
   Once the chemical containers near the one that was burning were
removed, the cordon was reduced to one-quarter mile at 6 p.m.
Saturday, allowing most of the 1,500 affected residents to return
home, said Mayor Jeffrey Maccarelli. The remaining canister
continued to burn Saturday evening but appeared to pose no hazard,
he said.
   Neil Mulvey, coordinator for the state Department of
Environmental Protection, said Thursday's explosion had obliterated
the lettering on at least one of the surrounding canisters, which
hampered their removal.
   Investigators said the plant burst into flames Thursday after a
cylinder exploded outside the facility and became a projectile,
shooting into the building.
   DEP spokesman Jim Staples said the canister that exploded had a
potent combination of 70 percent silane and 30 percent nitrous
oxide. Minutes before it blew up, Gollob officials had called
Liquid Carbonic Industries Corp., a Chicago-based chemical
distributor that had manufactured the compound, to come and remove
it.
   After the explosion, Liquid Carbonic alerted the Gould
Semiconductor Plant in Pocatello, Idaho, that similar canisters
might be stored there.
   Pocatello police Lt. Steve Stuart said he was told the cylinder
that exploded in New Jersey had been shipped there from Idaho after
it failed to work properly when being used in manufacturing at the
Pocatello plant.
   Dan Schroeder, Gould's plant manager, would not comment except
to confirm sandbagging and an evacuation of a nearby nursing home
were going on Saturday. ``There is very little jeopardy of a major
disaster happening,'' he said.
   In addition to the plant and a nursing home, the Idaho State
University Research Park complex and a junior high school where a
sports function was being held also were evacuated. The nursing
home housed 91 persons, authorities said.
   Plant officials had placed 2,800 sandbags around a suspect
canister, and a hazardous materials expert from Carbondale, Colo.,
was at the plant evaluating the situation.

<HEAD>Report: Ex-Party Chief Blamed No. 2 in Resignation Speech</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boris Yeltsin, who lost his job last fall as
Moscow Communist Party chief, harshly criticized the Soviet
Communist Party's No. 2 official in a dramatic speech before the
Central Committee, according to a published report.
   The account of the speech in the March 28 issue of U.S. News &
World Report was written by Seweryn Bialer, director of the
Research Institute on International Change at Columbia University,
based on interviews with officials in Moscow.
   According to the account, which was released Saturday, a visibly
nervous Yeltsin asked for permission to speak after Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev had finished a two-hour speech Oct. 21.
   Yeltsin said he was resigning from his posts as head of the
Moscow party and as candidate member of the Politburo, then spoke
for about 10 minutes, the report said.
   He accused the party leadership of misleading the Soviet public
about the extent of the nation's economic problems, overstating the
potential of Gorbachev's restructuring program, called perestroika,
and showering too much praise on Gorbachev. Then he criticized
Yegor Ligachev, the party's chief ideologist and No. 2 official,
U.S. News reported.
   ``There is one top leader I cannot work with any more. This man,
Ligachev, is an intriguer,'' Yeltsin told the Central Committee.
   ``He is a false man who still adheres to the old and condemned
style of leadership. He compiles secret dossiers on all members of
the leadership. Again and again, he sabotaged my efforts to improve
living conditions in Moscow. Ligachev should be censured by the
Central Committee.''
   According to the magazine, Yeltsin blamed Ligachev for blocking
steps to provide housing and food for an influx of workers to
Moscow.
   ``I am no angel and make mistakes,'' Yeltsin said. ``I can
justly be blamed for at least part of the difficult situation in
Moscow. But Comrade Ligachev's responsibility for this state of
affairs is very great, and he does not admit any of his
wrongdoings.''
   Gorbachev at one point interjected, ``Boris Nikolaeevich,
withdraw your resignation, and let us try to work together.'' But
Yeltsin replied, ``I sent my resignation, and I stand behind it.''
   Ligachev rose to speak and denied the charges, according to
Bialer. ``What Yeltsin said about excessive praise for Gorbachev is
simply a disgusting and politically harmful insinuation. We give
the general secretary the respect that is clearly his due for his
immense work and wise stewardship,'' Ligachev said.
   After Ligachev spoke, 22 other colleagues turned on Yeltsin over
a three-hour period, the magazine reported.
   Yeltsin was given a chance to rebut his accusers, and in a
15-minute speech he denied that he was charging Gorbachev with
creating a personality cult.
   Gorbachev then spoke again, and called Yeltsin's action ``a
bitter surprise'' and accused him of ``deserting the field of
battle.''
   Yeltsin was dismissed as Moscow party chief several weeks later
and removed from the Politburo in February.

   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis captured the
Kansas caucuses Saturday while Richard Gephardt won a major share
of the national delegates in South Dakota as the state went the way
of its earlier primary.
   Meanwhile, in Texas, the Democratic Party was slow in tabulating
the results of county conventions and caucuses. However, with 2,508
of the 5,288 delegates accounted for, Jesse Jackson had 1028,
Dukakis 895 and 276 were uncommitted.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 235 local delegates, Missouri
Rep. Richard Gephardt 57, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon 16 and former
candidate Gary Hart 1.
   Based on the results, Jackson will capture 27 of the 64
delegates Texas will allot through its second-track system, Dukakis
will gain 24 and 13 will be uncommitted.
   Texas already distributed 119 delegates based on the results of
the Super Tuesday primary, with Dukakis winning 43, Jackson 42,
Gore 25 and Gephardt nine.
   With 115 of the Kansas caucuses reporting their results to state
party headquarters in Topeka, Dukakis had 278 delegates, Jesse
Jackson 235, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. 125 and Gephardt 12. Another 114
local delegates had been elected in uncommitted status.
   No Democrats turned out in Greeley and Wichita counties in far
western Kansas, reducing the number of caucus sites from 117 to 115
and the number of local delegates selected from 768 to 764.
   ``It's terrific,'' Dukakis said at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner
in Detroit, where all the Democratic hopefuls except Jackson
gathered Saturday night. ``We've had a major victory in Kansas and
feel good about it. Now we're on to Michigan and here we are.''
   Asked about the significance of the Kansas win, Dukakis said,
``I think it's the first farm and agriculture state that I've won
and won decisively. I think that's a very good sign for the
future.''
   Dukakis picked up 16 of the 39 national delegates at stake in
Kansas. Added to the six delegates he gained earlier in the night
in South Dakota, Dukakis maintained his Democratic lead in the
delegate race with 503.5, according to The Associated Press survey.
   Jackson garnered 14 delegates in Kansas for a total of 483.55
and Gore gained 5 for 362.8. Four of Kansas' delegates were
uncommitted, raising the national total to 276.65.
   A total of 2,082 delegates are needed to nominate.
   Gephardt, who captured nine delegates in South Dakota for a
total of 154, said he wasn't really concerned about Kansas and that
his campaign's focus has been on Michigan for the last couple of
weeks.
   ``I'm concerned about doing well Michigan and I think we will,''
said Gephardt, who also spoke at the Detroit dinner.
   Michigan holds caucuses next Saturday to decide 138 delegates.
   Gore, who also was campaigning in Michigan, said the Kansas
caucuses ``looks like ... a contest that's going to be divided up
between the three front-runners. We expect to get our share of
delegates in Kansas. I'm very pleased with the results as they're
coming in.''
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who has 171.5 delegates, said before
the start of the Jefferson-Jackson dinner that he expected the
party to have to go through a bitter convention fight to selects
its nominee.
   ``I'm just saying that's a reality,'' Simon said. Even the
current front runner, Dukakis, would have to win about 80 percent
of the remaining delegates to wrap up the nomination on the first
ballot, he said, adding, ``That just isn't going to happen.''
   But Gore rejected that view, saying, ``Some things that people
think are inevitable turn out not to be. The race for the
nomination is wide open. Anybody who thinks otherwise at this point
is going to be surprised.''
   In South Dakota, which has 15 delegates at stake, Democrats
honored the results of the Feb. 23 primary in which Gephardt
received 44 percent of the vote and Dukakis 31 percent.
   ``This is a good demonstration of Democratic unity in South
Dakota,'' said Rick Hauffe, the newly named executive director of
the state Democratic Party. ``It's going to go uphill from here.''
   In a poll conducted for The Detroit News, Dukakis garnered the
support of 33 percent of the 385 people who said they likely would
vote in the Michigan caucuses.
   Jackson received 31 percent, while Gephardt was a distant third
with 10 percent, said the survey, which was published in Sunday
editions. Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, who has dropped out of
the race, received 7 percent of the vote, while Gore had 5 percent
and Simon 2 percent.
   The survey had a margin of error of 5 percentage points.
   Among Republicans, front-runner George Bush was expected to
capture the 14 delegates at stake in the winner-take-all primary in
Puerto Rico on Sunday. The vice president was the only GOP
candidate to mount an organized campaign on the island.
   In a poll conducted by The Milwaukee Journal, Bush held a
substantial lead over his GOP rivals among Republicans who will
vote in the Wisconsin primary on April 5.
   Bush had 69 percent, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole had 25 percent and Pat
Robertson had 6 percent. The survey of Republican voters had a
margin of error of 6 percent.
   Among the Democrats, Dukakis led with 38 percent, Jackson was
second with 30 percent, Gephardt and Simon tied for third with 11
percent and Gore was fifth with 10 percent. The Democratic survey
had a margin or error of 5 percent.
   The poll, conducted Wednesday and Thursday, surveyed 782
Wisconsin residents.

<HEAD>Academy Award Nominee Sought For Questioning After Books Found In
Lockers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An author up for an Oscar for
co-writing the screenplay to ``Full Metal Jacket'' was being sought
for questioning after thousands of books from libraries as far away
as Australia were found in storage lockers, police said Saturday.
   An estimated 10,000 books were recovered from a pair of lockers
rented in the name of Jerry Gustav Hasford, author of the novel
``The Short Timers,'' said detective Ray Berrett of California
Polytechnic State University campus police.
   The book was adapted into the 1987 Vietnam war drama ``Full
Metal Jacket,'' directed by Stanley Kubrick from a screenplay
written by Kubrick, Hasford and Michael Herr. The three share an
Academy Award nomination for the screenplay.
   The raid was staged Thursday by university police, who were
seeking 87 overdue books that had been checked out from the
Polytechnic university library in Hasford's name. Fines totaled
$3,000.
   ``We found a lot more than we bargained for,'' said Wayne
Carmack, another campus investigator.
   In addition to books and periodicals from the university, they
found thousands of books marked as belonging to libraries as far
away as England and Australia, some dating back to the 1860s, he
said. Also in the lockers were books missing from libraries in
Sacramento and St. Louis, Mo.
   Police said they had not yet contacted foreign library officials
to confirm whether those books were stolen.
   Hasford, who in recent years lived in nearby Morro Bay, doesn't
attend the university, but got a university library card under a
procedure open to state residents, Carmack said. However, the
address and Social Security number listed on the card were false,
he said.
   University investigators said they are seeking Hasford for
questioning but did not immediately seek an arrest warrant, because
they want to inventory the estimated 10,000 books in 396 cardboard
boxes, Berrett said.
   The man who checked out the books was known to library workers
and the operators of the storage locker as Jerry Hasford, the
author.
   ``He told everybody where we've been that he is the author of
the book, `The Short Timers,''' Berrett said. Copies of the book
and the ``Full Metal Jacket'' screenplay were in the lockers, he
added.
   Efforts to reach the author by telephone Saturday through
directory assistance in the San Luis Obispo area failed, as did
efforts to reach him through Bantam books, publisher of ``The Short
Timers.''
   He didn't appear Friday night at the Writers Guild of America
Awards ceremony, where he was considered for a similar award but
didn't win. The Oscar ceremony is set for April 11.

   Two Honduran warplanes bombed
Nicaraguan positions Saturday afternoon in a rugged border area
where President Jose Azcona Hoyo was reinforcing troops to oust the
Sandinista soldiers.
   The Nicaraguan Defense Ministry said the raid was on Nicaraguan
territory and caused no damage. Azcona, in a telephone interview
with The Associated Press, would neither confirm nor deny the
attack, but the Honduran military said it occurred on the Honduran
side of the ill-defined border.
   Honduras says the Sandinistas crossed the frontier in the Bocay
region last week in pursuit of U.S.-backed Contra rebels. Thousands
of U.S. troops have been sent to Honduras as a show of force, but
officials say they will not be sent to combat areas.
   Azcona threatened the Sandinistas Friday with air raids unless
they pulled out of Honduras. Nicaragua has denied its troops
crossed the border, but a Sandinista military official has
indicated Nicaraguan troops entered Honduras.
   The Honduran statement, issued by military intelligence late
Saturday, said the raid was ordered by the military high command
``with the objective of forcing the immediate withdrawal of the
Nicaraguan troops from our soil.''
   The statement said two U.S.-made F-5 fighter jets carried out
the raid but it gave no further details of the attack.
   The Nicaraguan Defense Ministry statement issued in Managua said
the raid was in the same area where Honduran jets dropped several
bombs on Thursday. Honduras has said that raid also was on its side
of the border.
   Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto sent a protest note
to Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez, saying his government
``energetically and formally protests'' the attack, which it called
``aggression against Nicaraguan territory.''
   The Nicaraguan Defense Ministry statement said two American-made
F-5 jets staged a 10-minute attack Saturday afternoon in the Bocay
area about 65 miles northeast of Managua, dropping four bombs
against Sandinista army positions but causing no damage.
   The ministry also said two F-5 warplanes flew over Sandinista
positions Saturday morning in the frontier sectors of Mukuwas, San
Andres de Bocay, Waniwas and Wayawas, but dropped no bombs.
   There was no immediate comment by Honduras on the reported
overflight.
   Both incursions were repelled by Sandinista anti-aircraft fire,
the ministry said.
   Azcona had announced he was sending more troops to the Bocay
region and also said he would not hesitate to seek more U.S. help.
   A few hours after Azcona made the statements and before
Nicaragua reported its territory was being bombed, the Honduran
armed forces said the Nicaraguans were pulling back.
   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, the armed forces spokesman, said
in a telephone interview ``their troops are withdrawing. About 600
Sandinista soldiers are still inside our country, and the rest have
abandoned the area during the past 24 hours.''
   Azcona had said before the armed forces announced the
Nicaraguans were withdrawing that the situation in the mountainous
Bocay region deteriorated when Sandinista troops re-entered
Honduras after having retreated to the Nicaraguan side. He
estimated the Nicaraguan strength in Honduras at about 2,000 by
Saturday morning.
   The president told The Associated Press he was reinforcing the
2,000 Honduran troops at the border with several more battalions.
   A Honduran military intelligence officer, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Honduran troops surrounded the Sandinistas and
were to shoot or capture any Nicaraguan soldiers found on the wrong
side of the border.
   About 3,200 U.S. troops have been sent to Honduras at the
request of the Honduran government since Thursday. The Pentagon
said the troops would be in Central America for about 10 days.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has said his government is
still willing to hold peace talks Monday with the Contras. A rebel
spokesman said the Contras also are willing to negotiate.
   Nicaragua is thought to be trying to wipe out Contra bases along
the border and a large rebel supply depot in the jungle north of
San Andres de Bocay.
   Ortega said he was appealing to the International Court of
Justice for an injunction to prevent action that would heighten
tension between the nations, and he asked the United Nations to
investigate the border dispute.
   The decisions of what is known as the World Court, a U.N. agency
based in Holland, are rarely enforceable unless both sides agree to
its jurisdiction.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar decided to send a U.N.
team to Nicaragua at Nicaragua's request, said U.N. spokesman
Mahbub Ahmad. Diplomatic sources said the team was likely to
include two military observers and probably would leave on Tuesday.

   Fire erupted out Saturday night at the
Radford Army Arsenal, killing one worker and injuring six others, a
spokeswoman for the arsenal said.
   The fire broke out about 7 p.m. in a building where a propellant
for rockets is produced, and was under brought control by 8:50
p.m., said the spokeswoman, Frances Selnow.
   Killed in the blaze was Terry W. Crawford, 32, of Radford, a
production operator, she said.
   Kenneth R. Rollins, 24, of Radford was severely burned and was
taken by helicopter to Roanoke Memorial Hospital and later to the
burn center at the University of Virginia's Hospital in
Charlottesville.
   Five others who suffered less serious injuries were treated and
released at the plant hospital, Ms. Selnow said.
   The dead and injured were employees of Wilmington, Del.-based
Hercules Inc., which operates the government-owned arsenal. The
7,095-acre arsenal operates 24 hours a day.
   Ms. Selnow said the cause of the fire was under investigation.

   Protesters scaled an Air Force base fence in New Jersey, battled
with police in San Francisco, and converged in other cities
Saturday to oppose sending U.S. troops to Honduras, while a few
smaller groups voiced support for the action.
   Opponents of the Reagan administration Central American policy
gathered in San Francisco for the third straight day, rallying in
the largely Hispanic Mission District before parading through other
parts of town. Police estimated the crowd at more than 4,000.
   In the evening, protesters battled with police for 25 minutes
after a fire was lit in the street near where demonstrators held
their last of several rallies.
   Several bottles, wooden crosses and bags of garbage were thrown
at two-dozen riot-clad police as several hundred protesters, some
wearing bandannas to hide their faces, rushed the officers and
tried to stop them from putting out the blaze.
   One person was arrested for felony assault on a police officer,
and four others were arrested on assorted charges, including
malicious mischief, vandalism and graffiti writing, said police
Capt. Mike Yalon.
   Elsewhere Saturday, few people were arrested at demonstrations.
On Friday, more than 350 protesters were arrested nationwide, with
250 of them occuring in San Francisco.
   In Boston, about 5,000 people, some carrying signs with slogans
such as ``Reagan and North _ Boy Scouts from Hell,'' rallied on the
Common at noon Saturday. Vietnam veterans, elderly couples and
young families with children listened to speeches, while some
protesters handed out copies of The Socialist Worker. Police
reported no arrests.
   Shortly after the rally began, about 10 members of the Young
Americans For Freedom appeared. Carrying signs in support of
President Reagan and Lt. Col. Oliver North, the group recited the
pledge of allegiance and chanted ``Ollie North, he's our hero, all
you Commies are one big zero!''
   ``We wanted to show that people support Reagan,'' said Ken
McCracken, 24, a Boston University student. ``We believe the U.S.
has the right to send troops to protect our interests. We love our
country.''
   One of those protesting on the other side was Robert Hickey, 34,
a Vietnam veteran. ``I'm here because I don't believe we should
send our troops to Honduras,'' he said. ``I think the Reagan people
have a communist hysteria. Anytime they see people rising up for
their rights _ they use the excuse that they're communists.''
   In Wrightstown, N.J., four people were taken into custody at
McGuire Air Force Base during a protest by about 100 demonstrators,
base officials said.
   About 25 demonstrators who sat down inside the base entrance
were carried outside the gate by Air Force police and 35 officers
dressed in riot gear. One man who broke away and entered the base
was taken into custody, as were three others who climbed over or
crawled under a fence. The four were later released.
   The Air Force ``maintained standard security precautions to
ensure the security of the base's perimeter and there was no
property damage,'' said Airman 1st Class Timothy Hoffman.
   In Chicago, between 50 and 100 people carrying signs and flags
walked about the downtown Daley Plaza to back U.S. policy in
Central America.
   ``We believe the struggle against Russian dominance has to take
place wherever Russia is grabbing territory,'' said Julian
Witkowski, 66, a retired furniture finisher who said he represented
a Polish-American group.
   Many of those who marched in the 45-minute demonstration said
they or their families were from Eastern European nations now
dominated by the Soviet Union.
   On Friday, the number of arrests among those protesting
administration policy was far larger. More than 350 people were
arrested in protests across the nation.
   Among the largest were those in San Francisco; and in
Minneapolis; Chicago; Salt Lake City; Washington, D.C.; Seattle;
Lewiston, Maine; and Sweetwater, Fla.

   An Israeli soldier was shot and killed in the
West Bank on Sunday, hospital officials said. It was the first such
incident since widespread unrest began 14 weeks ago.
   Also on the West Bank, Israeli troops shot and killed a
Palestinian man Saturday night when their patrol was attacked with
firebombs, the army said. Israel radio said the death resulted from
new orders that soldiers shoot at firebomb throwers.
   An army spokeswoman said assailants shot the soldier in the head
with a pistol as he stood watch near a government building in
Bethlehem. Soldiers immediately closed off the area and began
searching.
   The soldier died shortly after arriving at Jerusalem's Hadassah
hospital, hospital spokeswoman Ruth Mekel said.
   It was the first time since unrest began last December that a
soldier was shot, the army said. Last Thursday, an Israeli civilian
was shot and wounded in legs near a refugee camp in the occupied
Gaza Strip.
   An army spokesman said Palestinian youths hurled gasoline bombs
Saturday night at a patrol in the village of Kfar Dan near Jenin,
about 50 miles north of Jerusalem. Troops responded with gunfire,
killing one villager and wounding another.
   The Arab-owned Palestine Press Service said troops fatally shot
Nameq Milhem, 26, during a raid on the West Bank village.
   Israel radio quoted Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, commander of troops
in the West Bank, as saying the army had changed firing regulations
and soldiers were now ordered to shoot at firebomb throwers.
   The army spokesman, who spoke on condition he not be identified
in accordance with regulations, said he had no comment on the
report.
   Israeli gunfire, tear gas and beatings have killed 103
Palestinians since Arab unrest erupted in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip in early December, according to unofficial United
Nations figures.
   Arab reporters in Gaza said troops forced closure of the main
vegetable market in Gaza City Sunday morning, firing tear gas to
disperse crowds. They said merchants were told shops could open at
noon.
   The closure, similar to one enforced last week in the West Bank
town of Jericho, appeared to be aimed at thwarting a Palestine
Liberation Organization call for shops in the two towns to open
only during the mornings in protest of the Israeli occupation.
   The army also said it demolished two houses in the village of
Ubeidiya near Bethlehem Saturday night. It accused the owners of
taking part in attacks on Arabs suspected of collaborating with
Israeli authorities.
   On Saturday, the Defense Ministry announced that authorities
outlawed Shabiba, the youth group of Yasser Arafat's Fatah wing of
the Palestine Liberation Organization, making its members subject
to arrest.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
left Moscow Sunday for a meeting with President Reagan and other
officials in Washington on cutting long-range missiles.
   Shevardnadze is also to discuss other regional conflicts as well
as participate in the opening of a ``risk reduction center'' to
improve communications between the superpowers.
   Shevardnadze's departure was announced in a brief statement by
the Tass news agency.
   The Soviet foreign minister will be in Washington until March 23
on one of a series of exchange visits between him and Secretary of
State George P. Shultz in which they are trying to prepare for a
Moscow summit meeting later this year.
   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev hope to sign at
that meeting a treaty cutting both sides' long-range nuclear
missiles by 50 percent. They signed a treaty in December to
completely eliminate their medium-range weapons.
   Shultz visited Moscow in February and said he and Shevardarnadze
instructed their arms negotiators to draft verification and other
key parts of a treaty by the time of Shevardnadze's visit.

   An explosion Sunday morning destroyed
two houses in the center of this port city, killing two people and
injuring four while two others were missing, police said.
   A police official, who asked not to be named, said the 6 a.m.
blast was probably caused by a gas leak. The bodies of a mother and
3-year-old daughter were recovered from under the rubble while the
father was hospitalized, suffering from shock.
   Official documents showed that 10 people were living in the
four-story houses and only eight were accounted for 6 hours after
the blast. Police using specially trained dogs searched the rubble
for two women.
   Four people were slightly injured.
   The blast also damaged several other houses, while all windows
were shattered in a radius of 100 yards.

   Iran said it fired two long-range
missiles into Baghdad early Sunday in retaliation for Iraqi missile
and air raids and claimed that 5,000 Kurdish civilians died in
Iraqi chemical bomb attacks.
   In the Persian Gulf, Iran attacked a Liberian-flag tanker
Sunday, riddling it with rocket-propelled grenades but inflicting
no reported casualties, gulf-based shipping executives said.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the missiles
were launched at the Iraqi capital ``in response to savage attacks
by the Baghdad regime.''
   Sunday's pre-dawn missile attacks came as Iranians celebrated
the Persian new year.
   The Revolutionary Guards Corps, whose troops fire the missiles,
said in a communique that the missiles were aimed at ``two
important military centers'' in the Iraqi capital, a city of 5
million people.
   The official Iraqi News Agency reported one Iranian missile
demolished an apartment block in Baghdad, killing or wounding ``a
number of civilians, including women and children.''
   The reports from both capitals were monitored in Nicosia.
   Both sides, fighting a 7{-year-old war, have fired more than 200
missiles of various types into each other's main cities and border
towns since the latest eruption in the ``war of the cities''
erupted Feb. 29. Hundreds of civilians have reportedly died in the
attacks.
   Waves of Iraqi fighter-bombers pounded Iran's big Kharg Island
oil terminal in the northern Persian Gulf Saturday, leaving at
least two tankers ablaze. Iran said it shot down three Iraqi
warplanes.
   IRNA reported that at least six civilians were killed in Iraqi
missile attacks on Tehran Saturday night and in air raids on the
western cities of Dezful, Hamedan, Bakhtahran, Broujerd, Qazvin and
Arak.
   The agency quoted Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati as
disclosing that 5,000 Kurdish civilians were killed and 4,000
wounded when Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs on the towns of
Khormal. Halabja and Dojaila when Iranian forces captured them
Thursday.
   IRNA said Velayati, giving the figures in a letter to United
Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, criticized the
United Nations for failing to force Iraq to stop using chemical
weapons banned under a 1925 Geneva agreement.
   The Iranian gunboat attack on the 84,631-ton Atlantic Peace was
the fourth in three days near the Strait of Hormuz in the southern
gulf. The strait is the waterway's only outlet.
   The ship was hit about noon off the coast of Sharjah in the
United Arab Emirates as it sailed northward into the gulf, shipping
executives said.
   The sources, speaking on condition they were not named, said the
assault apparently started a small fire that the crew put out.
   The attack boats were not described, but the ship was hit by
several of the shoulder-fired rocket grenades commonly used by
speedboat-borne Iranian Revolutionay Guards.
   Iran has attacked neutral shipping in the gulf in retaliation
for Iraqi raids on vessels doing business with Iran.

   A disturbance erupted late Saturday
among more than 1,000 students on spring break, leaving four people
with stab wounds and two police officers with injuries, authorities
said. A car was missing after going off a ferry dock into the water.
   ``It's an all-out riot,'' said Anthony Lloyd, a Coast Guard
spokesman in Port Aransas. ``They are setting cars on fire. People
are hurt on the beach.''
   The disturbance began when a motorist hit a girl on the beach at
this popular Gulf Coast vacation spot and tried to leave the scene,
said Corpus Christi Department of Public Safety officer A.G.
Michniak.
   ``There was a hit-and-run accident on the beach that injured
one,'' Michniak said. ``The crowd stopped the car, took out the
occupants and tipped it over and burned it.''
   ``They stomped the car, broke all the glass out of it and
flipped it over,'' said Tom Frazier, 22, a student at the
University of Texas.
   At least eight people were arrested, Michniak said.
   Coast Guard divers Sunday morning battled a strong rip current
to search for the missing car.
   A ferry captain and deck hand watched the car ``drive through a
barrier and into the water because there was no ferry to catch the
car. They witnessed the car going down and we were called out. We
have no idea how many were in the car,'' said Coast Guard spokesman
Steven E. Sander
   The car broke in half a barrier similar to those at railroad
crossings and equipped with red flashing lights, he said.
   ``Most likely, whatever was in the car is still in the car,'' he
said.
   The car was in water about 18 feet deep. Coast Guard vessels
dragged the water, and divers hunted for the vehicle.
   ``We feel it is related to the spring breakers,'' Sander said.
``It happens every year. Just drunk college kids not thinking.''
   More than 100 law enforcement officers from south Texas and the
Coast Guard, using two helicopters and tear gas, responded to the
disturbance on the beach, the Corpus Christi Caller Times reported.
   Michniak estimated the crowd on the beach at about 3,000, while
Lloyd put it at about 1,000. Lloyd said most of the students
appeared to be high-school age.
   Law enforcement officials in Port Aransas said ambulances were
unable to get through the crowd to assist the injured.
   ``There are injuries, but we're unable to pull them out,'' said
a Port Aransas police dispatcher, who did not wish to be identified.
   Paul Guerra of Port Aransas said he witnessed a stabbing as he
left the beach.
   ``I walked by a group on a roadway. All of a sudden, somebody
yelled and a guy fell. He had blood all over his chest,'' Guerra
said. ``I heard them shout, He's stabbed! He's stabbed!' They
started tearing at his clothes, and then the police came running
over.
   ``I left,'' Guerra said. ``I hate to say it, but I was afraid
for my life.''
   Helicopters from the Coast Guard and the DPS swept the area with
searchlights.
   Michniak said the DPS received the first call at 11:35 p.m. and
declared the disturbance under control at 2:40 a.m. Sunday.
   About 30,000 students were staying in this island resort for
spring break, Lloyd said.

   EDITORS NOTE: Moscow Chief of Bureau Michael Putzel accompanied
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on his trip last week to
Yugoslavia and reports on the differences between the two communist
countries.

<TEXT>
   In a downtown high-tech shop, a
Hungarian computer is connected to a Japanese monitor and an
American printer. Western news magazines virtually unatainable in
Moscow are sold openly at newsstands.
   It's typical of accommodations Yugoslavia has made as it looked
both east and west in building a nonaligned communist nation.
   During a visit to three Yugoslav cities last week, Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev was introduced to contrasts between socialist
societies in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, which has developed
in relative isolation from the West.
   In the heavily Roman Catholic city of Ljubljana, people rise to
the clanging of church bells.
   The the ruling Yugoslav League of Communists, like the Soviet
Communist Party, is officially atheist, but the Roman Catholic and
Orthodox churches operate openly with little interference from
authorities. In contrast, religious practice in the Soviet Union is
severely restricted, and the state long ago seized most church
property.
   Kiosks throughout Yugoslavia display and sell both domestic and
foreign publications. Brassy color photos on foreign erotic
magazines that are banned in the Soviet Union share newsstand
windows with tracts on Marxism.
   The free-wheeling local press, ostensibly under the thumb of
government and party officials, is less inhibited than the most
avant-garde Soviet publications, testing ``glasnost,'' or the
policy of opennness pushed by Gorbachev.
   Shops in Belgrade sell a wide array consumer goods and gadgets,
and farmers' markets during the winter show off fresh fruits and
vegetables that haven't been seen in Moscow for months.
   In Yugoslavia there are no apparent shortages, in contrast to
Moscow where long lines form on the street at the first hint of
something desirable _ like Egyptian oranges or shoes from
Yugoslavia.
   In Slovenia, the prosperous northern republic Gorbachev visited,
most lines seem to be for state lottery tickets.
   Private restaurants abound in Yugoslavia, competing for
customers with attentive service and local and foreign specialties.
In the Soviet Union, such restaurants, known as cooperatives, only
started springing up in the last year.
   McDonald's is scheduled to open its first outlet in the
communist world in downtown Belgrade this week. Crowds already
gather at the door of a neatly renovated old building to examine
the signs depicting a Big Mac, french fries and other fare more
familiar in the West.
   The hamburger chain has been negotiating with the Soviets for
years but has so far been unable to satisfy itself that stores in
the Soviet Union could maintain quality control. And there remain
sticky questions about how Western investors could take their
profits out of the country.
   A Holiday Inn sign on a modern hotel in downtown Ljubljana
attests to the Yugoslavs' ability to make joint ventures work.
   The Soviets usually trade oil and other raw materials for prized
finished goods from Yugoslavia, such as shoes, clothing, furniture
and machine tools.
   Yugoslavs speak enthusiastically about their freedom to travel
abroad, a privilege accorded few Soviet citizens.
   Many Yugoslavs have visited relatives in the United States. More
than 1 million work abroad either because they could not find work
at home or can get more lucrative jobs elsewhere.
   The flight of growing numbers of workers is but one indication
this socialist society is struggling with some problems of its own,
such as 15 percent unemployment, triple-digit inflation and a $20
billion foreign debt.
   Typical of price increases announced almost daily, the airport
tax in Belgrade doubled the day Gorbachev left.
   On a street just off the main downtown square in Belgrade, a
white-bearded old man rummaged through a trash bin. A despairing
Yugoslav observer said such scenes have grown increasingly common
in recent years as the nation's economic crisis has dragged living
standards down from the boom years of the 1960s and early '70s.
   Just outside the gates of a sleek modern factory Gorbachev
visited in Slovenia, one of the most prosperous regions in the
communist world, a pathetic shantytown bore grim testament to the
inequality that persists, even in this socialist society.
   Gorbachev, a peasant's son, might find such deprivation all too
familiar. But the Adriatic might also have reminded him of home.
The route to Dubrovnik was reminiscent of the beautiful coastal
drive to the Crimean resort of Yalta or the Black Sea tourist mecca
of Sochi in Gorbachev's native southern Russia.
   The craggy coastlines are similar in all three places, lined
with cyprus and palm trees and defined by dramatic drops to lapping
seas.
   But in Dubrovnik, the stickers on the windows of every boutique
and shop inviting visitors to pay with Western credit cards is an
unfamiliar sight to the Soviet visitor.

   Passengers on two flights to Xinjiang, China's
northwesternmost province, reported UFO sightings, an official
report said Sunday.
   The state-run Xinhua News Agency said a passenger on a flight
from Beijing to Urumqi, the provincial capital, last Friday sighted
the unidentified flying object to the right in front of the plane
at 9:35 p.m.
   When the flight crew contacted local airports, they were told
there was no plane in the area at that time.
   The object was described as being about the size of a basketball
and sending out a beam like a searchlight. The crew sent a light
signal to the object, which was flying opposite the plane, but
received no response, Xinhua said.
   Three minutes later, the object changed directions and headed
north, then split into two, with a smaller ball above a bean-shaped
object. They were spinning at high speeds and gave off a ring of
green light, the news agency said.
   By 9:48 p.m., the objects had disappeared, according to the crew.
   Half an hour later, passengers aboard a flight from Canton to
Urumqi spotted the UFO over the same area in western Xinjiang,
Xinhua said.

<HEAD>President Says One Term Enough</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said Sunday
that she does not plan to seek re-election in 1992 and told a radio
audience that she lacks political ambition.
   Mrs. Aquino also announced on her weekly radio show that four
Manila policemen would answer charges before the Human Rights
Commission that they tortured captured communist rebels.
   Asked by a caller about her plans to seek a second six-year
term, Mrs. Aquino responded, ``I said earlier that I had no
political ambitions and I feel I really was meant for one term.
   ``And so one term it will be,'' she said. ``But I want to thank
the Filipino people for having given me this opportunity to serve
you at such a difficult time.
   ``I was only meant for transition. Even now I consider this the
transition period from dictatorship to full democracy,'' she said.
   Mrs. Aquino said the ``pillars of democracy'' _ the executive,
legislative and judicial branches of the American-style government
_ are already in place in the Philippines.
   ``But because of the economic problems there is no full
democracy because we must also have economic freedom,'' she said.
   Mrs. Aquino was swept to power in February 1986 by a popular
revolt that ended President Ferdinand Marcos' 20-year authoritarian
rule. Both she and Marcos claimed to have won the fraud-tainted
presidential election earlier that month.
   Mrs. Aquino said in response to another question that four
Western District police officers would testify before the
government Human Rights Commission, but did not specify when this
would be.
   The commission is merely an investigatory body, but it could
make its evidence available to a court of law if it finds
wrongdoing.
   She said commission chairwoman Mary Concepcion Bautista ``has
looked into the matter of recently captured communist insurgents.''
   Authorities rounded up two dozen suspected communist rebels last
month in sweeps throughout the capital. Seven were released for
lack of evidence and 17 remain in custody.
   Shortly after their capture, some of the detainees claimed they
had been tortured. Three of them appeared before the House of
Representatives' Human Rights Committee and displayed marks on
their bodies they said were the result of torture.
   The committee chairwoman, Rep. Nikki Coeseteng, later told
reporters the panel had found evidence of human rights abuse by the
military, and called the treatment given the detainees ``inhuman.''
   Earlier this month, the London-based Amnesty International and
the local Task Force Detainees charged there were widespread human
rights abuses in the Philippines.
   The church-backed Task Force said its investigation showed 7,444
Filipinos were arrested illegally in 1987, eclipsing the 5,967
arrests in 1985 when Marcos was president. It said many of those
arrested last year were tortured.
   Mrs. Aquino called the Amnesty report one-sided, and said the
body had relied on Task Force for its information. She urged the
two groups to bring their evidence to the rights commission.

<HEAD>Zhao's Report To Party Pushes For Faster Reform</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-China-Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang urged faster
and bolder reforms of China's government and economy in a major
speech published Sunday, making clear his opposition to recent
calls for caution.
   The speech was Zhao's last salvo before China's parliament, the
National People's Congress, begins a session Friday during which
opposing views are expected to be aired.
   The head of the National People's Congress, Peng Zhen, and the
head of government, acting Premier Li Peng, both are more
conservative than Zhao in their approach to reforming China's
centralized economy and inefficient bureaucracy.
   Zhao urged increasing incentives to foreign businesses to trade
and invest in China, a thorough shake-up of the sluggish government
bureaucracy, more competition among factories and more openness in
party and state affairs.
   In the speech's only reference to opposition, Zhao said the
party ``demands that all Communist Party members working in the
State Council, especially high-ranking officials, should contribute
their bit in the reform.'' The State Council is China's Cabinet.
   The speech was delivered to the party's 175-member Central
Committee, which ended a five-day meeting Saturday. The official
Xinhua News Agency published a lengthy summary of the speech but
did not say what day it was delivered.
   Chinese incomes have more than doubled in the 10 years since
senior leader Deng Xiaoping began the campaign to decentralize the
economy and government and restore market forces and economic
incentives.
   No top officials openly criticize the reforms, but some
conservatives have emphasized the need to move slowly.
   Among them is Li Peng, who has emphasized the need to control
inflation and other ills triggered by the reforms. Li is expected
to be confirmed as premier at the National Party Congress.
   In a speech marking the Lunar New Year on Feb. 17, Li said the
government may expand its subsidies of major commodities in order
to reduce inflation, which hit 7.5 percent nationally last year but
reached 19 percent in some cities.
   Such a move would be a dramatic reversal of Zhao's program to
gradually reduce subsidies and allow supply and demand to set
prices.
   In his Central Committee speech, Zhao called for continuing
price reform and said higher food prices would send a signal to
farmers to produce more.
   Some officials have indirectly criticized the reforms by warning
about growing materialism in China and corruption among government
and party workers.
   Zhao acknowledged the problem and called for closer supervision
of government employees and regular wage increases so they will be
less tempted to engage in extortion.
   Said Zhao: ``Communists should be the first to be concerned
about their country and people and the last to enjoy themselves.''

   A man and his two daughters drown when
they went out for a ``holy dip'' in a river during the solar
eclipse, the Nepalese National News Agency reported Sunday.
   Hindu legend has it that a bath in a natural spring or river
during a solar eclipse will cleanse away one's sins and the sins of
one's ancestors.
   The news agency said the man, who was the chief officer of the
Mahendranagar municipal council, and his daughters were swimming in
the Mahakali River, 375 miles south west of Katmandu, Friday when
they drowned.
   Millions of Hindus in Nepal and India bathed in rivers, pools
and streams during the solar eclipse that passed over large parts
of Asia and the Pacific Ocean.

   Police Sunday seized nearly 50 pounds of pure
heroin, worth about $24 million, and arrested two South Africans in
the biggest drug bust at Rome's Fiumicino airport since 1984.
   Irene Viljoen and Luis Frederick Zehmke, both 22, were en route
from Bombay to Madrid when they were arrested.
   Italian news agencies said the heroin was found during a routine
luggage check. It was concealed in secret compartments in two
suitcases.
   The identification tags on the suitcases matched those on the
tickets of the two South Africans.
   Both men, who could face up to 15 years imprisonment, denied
owning the suitcases. They said the luggage had been handed to them
by strangers in Bombay.
   In 1984, police confiscated 116.6 pounds of heroin from 11 Thai
citizens at the airport.

   Scuffles broke out when chanting
protesters clashed with security men Sunday outside a hotel where
former U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was scheduled to
address a press conference.
   Demonstrators surrounded Weinberger's car and hit it before
police removed them.
   About 30 demonstrators protesting U.S. foreign and military
policies greeted Weinberger, who was visiting Australia as
President Reagan's official bicentennial representative.
   Australia is celebrating the 200th anniversary of white
settlement this year.
   Weinberger later told journalists the protest was a ``very
pallid little affair'' compared to demonstrations he had been
subjected to in California.
   Commenting on the U.S. decision to send 3,200 troops to
Honduras, Weinberger said it was purely a military exercise.
   ``These forces are not committed to combat overseas, but they
are having a very important exercise,'' he said.
   ``We do this frequently without some of the overtones that a lot
of people are perceiving in this,'' Weinberger said. ``We are not
seeking a war, we're not going into a combat zone.''

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fourth Parliament in Bangladesh's
17-year history was sworn in Sunday, but allegations of a rigged
election raise doubts about the legitimacy of the lawmaking body.
   Parliament Speaker Huda Choudhury gave the oath of office to the
new members, although the 18 members of the Combined Opposition
Party failed to attend the ceremony. There was no immediate
explanation for their absence.
   Despite its name, the opposition bloc consists of 76 small
parties loyal to the government of President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad.
   The Parliament was chosen March 3 in an election where there was
much evidence of vote tampering and little of voter turnout,
despite the government's claim that more than 50 percent of voters
took part.
   Opposition parties boycotted the polling and charged that fewer
than 1 percent of voters cast ballots.
   No Parliament in Bangladesh ever has served its full five-year
term. The previous one, elected in 1986, was dissolved by Ershad
last Dec. 6 in a move to compromise with opposition parties
demanding the president's ouster.
   The main opposition coalition of 21 parties denounced the move,
however, and boycotted the elections, saying fair elections under
Ershad were impossible.
   Ershad's Jatiya Party won 251 of the 300 seats. The National
Socialist Party got three, the Freedom Party two, and independent
candidates won 25 seats. Election for one seat was postponed after
a candidate was slain.
   The president told a religious gathering on March 13 that he
would offer legislation to amend the constitution to make
Bangladesh an Islamic state. The country's population is more than
90 percent Moslem.
   Ershad's party could easily adopt such legislation, having well
over the needed two-thirds majority in the Parliament.
   But the opposition parties _ still carrying out a four-month
campaign of strikes and rallies to oust Ershad _ already have
announced they will oppose the move.
   Even the leader of the fundamentalist Moslem party
Jamaat-e-Islami, Abbas Ali Khan, denounced the proposal. ``This is
a political gimmick by Ershad to perpetuate his rule,'' he said.
   Ershad, a former general, has vowed not to resign. He took power
in a bloodless coup in 1982 and was elected in 1986 in a vote that
the opposition claims was rigged.
   Bangladesh became an independent state in 1971 after a civil war
with Pakistan.

<TEXT>
   U.S. envoy Philip Habib arrived in Jordan
on Sunday for talks on the U.S. plan for peace in the Middle East
after meeting with officials in Egypt, where he said negotiations
went well.
   Habib met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo and
later told reporters the talks were ``extraordinarily good,''
Egypt's state-run Middle East News Agency reported.
   His tour also will take him to Saudi Arabia and Morocco.
   High-ranking Jordanian officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Habib would meet with King Hussein and other
officials. But they noted that Jordan would not deliver an
immediate response to the U.S. proposals.
   Jordanian officials also have said recently that the government
was unlikely to respond to the proposals for about another week.
   Habib's mission is a follow-up to a tour by U.S. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, who shuttled among Egypt, Jordan, Israel
and Syria in early March to pitch the American peace plan for the
40-year old Arab-Israeli conflict.
   The plan calls for a three-year period of self-rule for the 1.5
million Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Negotiations on the final status of the occupied
territories would start in December.
   Mubarak has called the plan encouraging, but suggested, without
going into specifics, that some of its provisions be ``developed.''
   Habib was quoted by the Middle East News Agency as saying U.S.
officials had emphasized that the plan ``would not be altered or
cut up.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington on
Friday that Habib would solicit the views of leaders of the four
countries on his itinerary and would also brief them on talks this
week in Washington between administration officials and Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Judge Has Long Career, Mixed Reviews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some years ago, rating the nation's federal
judges, American Lawyer magazine praised the ``mental strength'' of
Gerhard A. Gesell, but took off points because his ``arrogance is
offensive to many attorneys.''
   As a judge who has dealt with Watergate and other highly
publicized cases in his 20 years on the bench, 77-year-old Gesell
is on the hot seat again. He was hand-picked by the capital's chief
federal judge to try former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, and two arms dealers in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   American Lawyer found Gesell ``widely regarded as the most agile
and powerful mind on the D.C. bench,'' but it also had ``a
suspicion that he is too sure of his own abilities; that he is
perhaps overbearing.''
   Few lawyers who ever appeared before Gesell would disagree with
those assessments. Gesell is tough. He was once described by a
Washington columnist as having ``a rosy troll-king's face,'' but
more often than not it's that of a storm king.
   Such things are not said publicly, but the probability is Gesell
was tapped because he is the most likely to get the job done
swiftly and cleanly. It will be up to Gesell to decide the
politically absorbing question of the trial's timing. Before the
November election or afterward? Before Reagan leaves office or
after?
   Gesell is the emperor of his courtroom. He makes things move.
Long-winded lawyers quickly learn to change their ways.
   When he is displeased, everyone knows it.
   Gesell conducted the 1974 ``plumbers'' trial in which John D.
Ehrlichman, the former presidential domestic adviser, was convicted
of violating the rights of a psychiatrist by sending White House
agents to burglarize his office.
   Ehrlichman found Gesell ``obviously hostile.'' He wrote later
that ``a number of spectators at that trial gave us affidavits
describing Gesell's facial reactions and gestures, which seemed
intended to indicate to the jury how he felt about me and my
attorneys.''
   Gesell called the case ``a shameful episode in the history of
our country.'' And he expressed a sentiment that may come into play
in the Iran-Contra trial: ``It is impossible to preserve freedom
anywhere when zealots take over and the rule of law is ignored.''
   Four years ago, Gesell had a case that involved the language in
the law that governs how federal commissions operate. ``Another
example of unimpressive legislative drafting,'' he grumped. ``The
courts do not welcome their role in such disputes,'' he said.
   In 1980, Gesell ruled that the Air Force was wrong in ousting a
decorated Vietnam veteran because he was a homosexual. Gesell
accused the service of perverse behavior.
   But three years earlier, he had dismissed the suit of another
acknowledged homosexual to be reinstated to the service. Gesell
concluded that ``an individual's right to privacy does not extend
to homosexual conduct even when it occurs in private between
consenting adults.''
   Gesell is among a generation of Americans whose parents used the
book ``The Child From Five to Ten'' as a guide to bringing them up.
In his case, however, the teaching was more direct: the author was
his father, noted Yale child psychologist and pediatrician Arnold
Gesell.
   A Yale graduate himself, Gesell made a name as an antitrust
lawyer with Covington & Burling, one of Washington's most renowned
law firms. He was named to the federal bench in 1968 by President
Lyndon B. Johnson.
   He quickly developed a reputation as one of the most scholarly
judges in the courthouse.
   Gesell's opinions have ranged widely: in 1970 he ordered the
House Internal Security Committee not to publish a report that
listed 65 people as radical campus speakers. It was a landmark
decision limiting congressional power.
   In 1968, he broadened the District of Columbia's law to permit
abortions virtually at a physician's discretion. The ruling was
reversed by the Supreme Court.
   And in 1971 he ruled that the Washington Post could publish the
Pentagon Papers study on the origins of the Vietnam war, saying
``There is no proof that there will be a definite break in
diplomatic relations, that there will be an armed attack on the
United States ... or on an ally, that there will be war.''

<DATELINE>MAMELODI, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outside toilets, cornmeal for
dinner and police visits in the middle of the night gave 170 white
Christians a taste of everyday life in this black township.
   The event, designed to bring whites and blacks together and
break down apartheid barriers, was organized by two Christian
groups and ended Sunday with an emotional church service at a YMCA
hall.
   Hundreds of worshipers clasped hands and swayed in rhythm to
hymns of Christian fellowship. Said the Rev. Nico Smith, one of the
encounter's organizers: ``I thank God that this is still possible
in South Africa.''
   On Saturday night, while soldiers checked cars entering the
township a few hundred yards away, the black hosts and their white
guests barbecued sausage and dipped cornmeal from a huge iron pot
while discussing the four-day encounter at a picnic.
   ``Ten years ago if we did this the police would have just come
and chased all the blacks away,'' said Smith.
   Murray Hofmeyr, 29, a white theology student, was asked
repeatedly to tell how police had come to the door at 3:30 a.m.
Friday to arrest him and his host, black churchworker Sandy Lebese.
He said they refused to say why and ``were very rude.''
   Police freed Hofmeyr a few hours later ``when I finally
convinced them what was going on, that there were 170 white people
staying in the township that night. They didn't believe me.''
   Lebese, who was imprisoned from 1977 to 1983 on a sabotage
conviction, remained in detention without explanation.
   Another delegate, Nick Paton, grandson of novelist Alan Paton,
said police came to his door, also, at 2:30 a.m., asking what he
was doing in the township.
   ``It's not normal to see a white man putting up in a black
house,'' said one of the hosts, Joe Sekese, who was not surprised
by the police action. ``I think it's a breakthrough, because in
fact, I expected something tragic to happen, that the soldiers
would break up the whole thing.''
   Smith, a white Dutch Reformed minister who moved into Mamelodi
with government permission two years ago, said he believed the
police action ``was just the way they harass you, to let you know
they're there, in control.''
   But Hofmeyr said he thought police were looking for a white man
they believed responsible for a car-bombing Thursday 20 miles
southwest of Pretoria.
   Jacques Bosch, 11, spent four days playing with 12-year-old
Mandla Mabena as their parents tried to get to know each other.
   Mandla's mother, Betty, who works as a maid in a white home in
Pretoria, said she was worred about having a white woman come to
her house as a guest. She said her employers ``treat me like
family,'' but they have never been to her home.
   ``I was concerned about what food to serve, what beddings I
had,'' said Mrs. Mabena.
   Some delegates stayed in typical four-room township homes, with
a toilet in the yard, a zinc basin to bathe in, and not enough beds
to go around. Others stayed in the more modern homes that the
government and private industry are building to combat political
unrest.
   Some of the worst violence of the past three years occurred in
Mamelodi, and soldiers still patrol the streets.
   ``Most of my black friends are ... mostly radical people
fighting for a better South Africa, fighting their bitterness. It
was an experience to see the peace and quiet here,'' said Annemarie
Bosch.
   When guests took their hosts out for dinner Friday night, some
reported rude comments and noticed stares from other diners in the
restaurants. Most said they had no trouble.
   The delegates, including about 40 blacks who stayed in white
homes in Pretoria, tried to adopt a joint statement at the end of
the encounter that would reflect their mutual experience, but found
they could not.
   ``Apartheid was very successful,'' said Smith. ``It succeeded to
divide the people, to separate them from one another. It eventually
ended up with the whites fearing the blacks and the blacks being
furious with the whites, and you know anger and fear is a recipe
for violence.''
   Smith promoted a separate message from the whites to tell other
whites what they had learned and urge an end to ``this forced
separation'' of the races under apartheid.
   David Ramakgadi, a church field worker, read the blacks'
statement: ``We are thrilled that at last, after a struggle of more
than 50 years, you have come to our township not to tell us, but to
listen. We see our communities as schools to educate people about
the need to liberate South Africa.''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Most callers want to know how the virus can be transmitted and
ways to prevent it, Dr. Doyin Odupe, president of the Nigeria

quoted in the Lagos Concord newspaper as saying.
   Nigeria, with an estimated 100 million people, has only 20 known

   Prince Charles returned to Britain on
Sunday after spending a somber weekend near the site of an
avalanche that killed his friend and just missed the prince during
a skiing trip.
   The March 10 avalanche also injured another member of the royal
skiing party, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson.
   Charles called on her twice at the Davos hospital during his
two-day stay. She has twice undergone surgery after suffering
complicated fractures of both legs.
   He also took a long walk in the mountains not far from the spot
where Maj. Hugh Lindsay was fatally struck by the snowslide that
narrowly missed the prince. Charles Palmer-Tomkinson and Swiss
guide Bruno Sprecher accompanied him.
   Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson's condition was reported to have
considerably improved.

   Michael J. Fox delved into the drudgery of
fact-checking while preparing for his role in the upcoming movie
``Bright Lights, Big City'' and found the experience ``very
frustrating.''
   Fox, who plays wise-cracking Alex Keaton on NBC's Family Ties,
checked pie recipes during a stint at Esquire magazine to get a
feel for the job of the protagonist in the movie based on Jay
McInerney's novel.
   Fox plays Jamie Conway, a fact-checker at a New York magazine
who can't handle the fast lane and retreats into cocaine.
   ``I ended up checking recipes for black cherry pie, and let me
tell you, it's a very frustrating job,'' Fox told the Chicago
Tribune.
   ``People just aren't that cooperative on the phone, so I started
to relate to Jamie pretty quickly, and to his ambition and his
idealizing,'' Fox said.
   ``Bright Lights, Big City'' makes its debut April 1.
   ``A lot of people told me it was so strange to think of me
playing a guy with a drug problem,'' Fox told the Chicago
Sun-Times. ``I dunno. If there's a consistent quality about my
acting and the characters I play, it's a guy who's gonna make it.
   ``But there is a fine line in this movie between a guy who has
unfulfilled potential and is very frustrated, and a guy who starts
taking himself out of his mind chemically,'' he said.
   Fox's next project is a movie in Thailand, directed by Brian De
Palma and co-starring Sean Penn.

<TEXT>
   Emergency action by federal regulators to
stabilize two big banking companies hit by deposit runs is sure to
revive charges of a double standard for dealing with ailing
financial institutions.
   While small banks are closing at a rate unseen since the Great
Depression, the government, in effect, has declared large banks too
big to fail, the critics say.
   The best known example of the ``Too-Big-To-Fail Syndrome'' is
Continental Illinois Corp., which in 1984 required $4.5 billion in
the largest-ever government bailout.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the agency that insures
deposits in commercial banks, hopes to recover all but $1.7 billion
of that by selling its stake in Continental. But nearly four years
after the bailout, the FDIC is still the major stockholder in the
bank.
   Two government moves last week to prop up institutions nearly
identical in size to Continental are renewing concerns.
   The FDIC on Thursday pumped $1 billion into First RepublicBank
Corp. of Dallas, which has lost nearly $2 billion in deposits since
the start of the year. With $33.2 billion in assets, it is the
nation's 13th largest commercial bank holding company.
   The agency also promised to protect all depositors and general
creditors of the company's 73 subsidiary banks.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates savings
institutions, made a similar pledge on Friday regarding the $33.7
billion Financial Corp. of America, owner of the Stockton,
Calif.,-based American Savings & Loan Association.
   The second largest thrift holding company in the country, FCA
had lost $493 million in deposits in January and February. Its
request for $1.5 billion in assistance is under review.
   The eventual price tag of solving the problems at First
RepublicBank and FCA isn't known for certain, but analysts believe
the bailouts ultimately could rival, and possibly even surpass, the
Continental Illinois rescue.
   The promises made by the FDIC and bank board go beyond the
agencies' normal practice. Usually, deposit accounts are protected
only to $100,000, and creditors are not protected at all.
   When smaller banks fail, as 184 did last year, the FDIC pays off
depositors up to the insurance limit or arranges for the accounts
to be transferred to a solvent institution.
   Big banks, with their extensive ties to other banks, present a
more complicated problem. The failure of a large institution could
cause a chain reaction of insolvencies at smaller banks and end up
costing the FDIC more than the amount needed to keep the big bank
operating.
   Using government aid to entice private investors to take over an
ailing institution also is often cheaper than a straight payoff of
depositors.
   That logic doesn't make it any easier for executives who watch
their small banks go under while their colleagues at large
institutions stay in business.
   Beyond the big bank-small bank double standard, there is what
some regard as a dual standard in dealing with large regional banks
like First RepublicBank and the even bigger money center banks
deeply involved with shaky loans to Third World countries.
   Paul Getman, a financial economist with The Wefa Group, a
Philadelphia consulting firm, said bankers at the large regional
institutions, whose loans are in real estate and energy, believe
regulators are much more reluctant to force money center banks to
write down the value of overseas loans.
   ``Texas bankers feel ... the FDIC is not clamping down as hard
on New York City banks because the nature of their bad loans is
such that they can get away with saying they're worth 50 cents on
the dollar, for example,'' Getman said.
   ``There's a lot of political play (in how loans to Third World
countries are valued), whereas everyone knows that loans on Texas
real estate are worth 15 cents on the dollar,'' he said.
   Rep. Ferdnand G. St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the House
Banking Committee, said he plans hearings this spring on the
criteria used to decide ``who survives and who fails among the
troubled institutions.''
   St Germain has voiced concern in the past about ``sweet
fail-safe deals for private investors.''
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, however, has pointed out that
government bank rescues bail out depositors, usually not
stockholders, corporate debt holders or management.
   Bert Ely, a private financial institutions analyst in
Alexandria, Va., defended bailouts as saving money for the
insurance funds, which are funded by premiums paid by banks and
savings and loans and ultimately backed by the taxpayer.
   Ely argued that regulators ought to make bailouts far sooner
than they usually do.
   ``The important thing is that they end the tragedy. ... Every
hour that goes by increases banks' losses and the losses (to the
insurance funds). It is so critical to get that assistance in there
and stop the bleeding right away,'' he said.

   Liberal and conservative Chinese leaders gather
Friday to wrangle over the future of the country's economic and
political reforms in a congress that could reveal how deep
divisions are between the camps.
   Featured at the annual meeting of the National People's
Congress, China's parliament, will be Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang, and acting Premier Li Peng, who heads the conservatives.
   Zhao, 69, the protege of semi-retired senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, is the champion of rapid reform. In a speech published
Sunday, Zhao urged faster and bolder reforms, making clear his
opposition to recent calls for caution.
   Li, 59, a Soviet-educated engineer, is regarded as a cautious
technocrat who supports the reforms but would limit their scope and
slow their implementation.
   Zhao was the star at a major Party Congress last fall that laid
down guidelines for China into the 21st century. At the congress,
however, Li will be at center stage, delivering a key report at the
opening of the three-week session that will define the nation's
immediate goals.
   Li is expected to sound several conservative themes _ that the
government must pay more attention to the countryside following
three straight disappointing grain harvests and that controlling
double-digit inflation must take precedence over further reform of
China's inefficient pricing system.
   Analysts also will watch how much support Li gives Zhao's
ambitious proposal to turn factories along China's coast into
processing centers for exports. The plan is controversial because
it would allow coastal regions to develop faster than China's vast
interior.
   Some observers say open disagreement between Zhao and Li is
unlikely. Both support China's economic changes, but they differ on
the pace.
   ``Five years ago you could talk about reformists and
conservatives,'' said one Asian diplomat. ``But today nobody would
come out against reform.''
   The first session of the 7th Congress _ each congress sits for
five years _ will be one of the busiest and most important in
years. It will confirm Li as premier, replace Li Xiannian as
president and fill dozens of important government posts.
   The 2,970 delegates will approve a government reorganization in
which several ministries are to merge or be eliminated. They also
will amend the constitution to legalize private businesses and pass
several laws.
   Most important is the industrial enterprise law, which will give
legal definition to the government's attempts to separate the
functions of the owner _the state _ and the manager of businesses.
   Factory managers will be given the right to run their plants
without undue interference from government and party officials.
They also will take responsibility for profits and losses.
   The congress will also vote to make southern China's Hainan
Island, a focus of Zhao's coastal development plans, a new province.
   The congress will also enact important personnel changes.
   Several elderly leaders, who have opposed most economic reforms,
will finally step down.
   But conservatives who favor cautious change, and not rapid
reformers, will probably take their place.
   Li, named acting premier when Zhao was appointed head of the
party last fall, will take over the post held for 27 years by his
foster father, Chou En-lai. He will also head the Commission for
Restructuring the Economy, giving him greater influence in
determining, and possibly slowing, the course of reforms.
   Li Xiannian, 78, will end his five-year term in the largely
ceremonial post of president, and is likely to replace Deng
Yingchao, 84, Chou En-lai's widow, as chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body.
   Tapped to be the next president is Yang Shangkun, 80, a senior
military officer, member of the party Politburo and friend to Deng
Xiaoping.
   Yao Yilin, 71, a respected but somewhat conservative economist,
is slated to head a powerful Economic Planning Commission.
   The new defense minister, replacing 78-year-old Zhang Aiping, is
expected to be Qin Jiwei, 74, former Beijing Military Region
commander and a Politburo member.
   Peng Zhen, an 86-year-old conservative curmudgeon, will resign
as chairman of the People's Congress, with Vice Premier Wan Li a
likely successor.

<TEXT>
   Dreaming of life in the circus, a handful of
would-be Big Top stars practiced slapstick skits, laughed at
pretend jokes and even took a shaving cream pie in the face at
auditions for Clown College.
   For two hours Saturday, about 35 people _ including an actress,
a singer, a history teacher and a retired dentist _ tested their
mettle as clowns, vying to get into the school in Venice, Fla.,
dubbed the ``Yale of Yucks'' and the world's only institution of
higher laughter.
   ``In order to be a good clown, you have to have a heart the size
of Alaska and be willing to give it away on a daily basis,'' said
Steve Smith, director of the college run by Ringling Bros. and
Barnum & Bailey Circus.
   ``You can't go out and flap your arms around and think that's
clowning,'' Smith told the clown hopefuls. ``You have to feel it
and believe it.''
   With a videotape camera rolling, Smith tested the applicants'
abilities in mime, acting movement and classic clown gags in a
dance practice room at DePaul University.
   Competition to get into Clown College is nearly as keen as for
the Ivy League.
   The school holds about 25 auditions a year around the country
for a maximum of 60 openings. Last year, 2,000 people applied to be
trained as clowns and only 50 were accepted, Smith said.
   To make the cuts, Smith and Ruth Craddock, a teacher at the
college, review audition videotapes and written applications
submitted by the aspiring clowns.
   The clown candidates pantomimed different emotions, contorting
their faces in anger, drooping in sadness and beaming with
happiness. They acted out a simple slapstick skit and practiced
laughing hysterically when a fellow auditioner pretended to tell a
joke.
   ``We're giving a collective hug to 20,000 people (in the circus
audience) and are trying to make them forget for two hours that the
toilet won't flush, the bills are overdue and their kid needs
braces,'' explained Smith, wearing a clown suit of blue pants,
rainbow suspenders, red polka-dot bow tie, yellow hair and red bulb
nose.
   For those who are accepted, the 10-week program in such skills
as stilt-walking, gymnastics and pantomime is free _ with a catch.
The students must agree to join the Ringling Bros. circus as a
clown if they are good enough.
   ``We think of it as boot camp for the circus,'' said Smith, the
former host of a children's television program in Chicago. ``We're
very serious about being silly.''
   Jason Stern, a 46-year-old retired dentist who runs an
international contracting business, tried out on his 23rd wedding
anniversary because, he said, he harbors a secret desire to be a
clown.
   ``I'm at that stage in life where I want to really enjoy
myself,'' Stern said. ``I'd drop everything I'm doing'' to join the
circus.
   Noah Budin, a 27-year-old singer wearing a Hawaiian shirt and a
Cleveland Indians hat, said he has dreamed of working as a clown
since his childhood.
   ``I've just never grown up,'' he said. ``I want to perform for
people and make them laugh. ... I want to feel that power.''
   ``We're not looking for people who can juggle and ride unicycles
because we can teach that,'' said Smith, who went through Clown
College in 1971 and has been its director since 1985. ``What I'm
really looking for are people who have a sincere desire to learn
the craft and who have a big heart.''

   Israelis strafed hills and combed the
countryside in their deepest push into southern Lebanon this year
in an apparent effort to knock out guerrilla bases there, police
said Sunday.
   Their troops, however, met no resistance Saturday as they
pressed north several miles beyond the eastern end of their buffer
zone toward the Shiite Moslem village of Maydoun, police said. They
withdrew about four hours later.
   The ground assault followed increased guerrilla attacks on the
security belt with Soviet-made Katyusha rockets. Israel said it
needed the buffer area to deter such attacks when it withdrew most
troops from Lebanon in June 1985 after its 1982 invasion and
three-year occupation.
   The Israelis and militiamen from the mainly Christian South
Lebanon Army fought a seven-hour artillery duel with Shiite Amal
militiamen on Saturday before moving north.
   Amal said 10 militiamen from the South Lebanon Army were killed
or hurt and one Shiite fighter wounded in the exchanges engulfing
the villages of Mashgara and Ein el-Tineh near Maydoun. Police
reported two civilians and a Syrian soldier wounded.
   Syria has 25,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.

Chief's Yard</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two days after the police chief's father
died, authorities began digging in the chief's front yard. They
kept digging until they found a skeleton 20 feet down that turned
out to be the first husband of the chief's current wife.
   No charges have been filed and authorities have released few
details of their investigation.
   They have only confirmed, from dental records, that the skeleton
was the remains of Russell Bean, and that he had been beaten on the
head and chest with an unidentified object.
   Bean was 25 when he was last seen in 1978. He and Robert
Chambers, who became the part-time police chief three years ago,
apparently met while working together at a factory in Keene and
became drinking buddies.
   After Bean disappeared, Chambers divorced his first wife and
married Bean's wife, Sylvia, about 35.
   Chambers, 36, and other members of the family have said nothing
publicly about the case.
   Chambers was part-time police chief in Marlow and nearby Gilsum;
he has resigned the Marlow job and taken indefinite leave from the
Gilsum post. He has also been suspended from the police force in
Winchester.
   His wife has left her job as a school-bus driver and their four
children from former marriages have been taken out of school.
   Chambers' former wife, Deborah, living in Jaffrey, was
hospitalized while authorities were digging in Chambers' yard;
authorities won't say why or disclose her condition.
   The mystery began unfolding March 9 with the death of Chambers'
father, Clifton Chambers, 61.
   The Keene Sentinel reported that sources with detailed knowledge
of the investigation said the elder Chambers told his daughter
Melissa that Bean died accidentally in a fist fight when he fell
and hit his head on a rock, and that the elder Chambers had helped
bury him.
   Melissa Chambers reportedly told authorities the deathbed tale
the next day, and the digging began March 11.
   On March 14, Clifton Chambers was buried. Hours later, when the
hole in Robert Chambers' yard was 20 feet deep and 25 feet in
diameter, Bean's skeleton was found.
   On Thursday, March 17, it was determined Bean had been beaten
with a blunt object.
   Chambers' lawyer, Mark Sisti of the public defender's office,
said he could not answer questions about how the body came to be
buried there or whether Chambers knew. But he said, ``My client had
nothing to do with causing the death of Mr. Bean.''
   Sisti filed a motion Friday to gain access to documents that
persuaded a judge to issue the search warrant that allowed
authorities to dig up Chambers' yard. ``A lot of reports have been
generated through rumors and speculation and we'd like to see
exactly what's in there,'' he said.
   The attorney general's office said it will try to keep the
documents sealed.
   All that has left the 600 residents of the rural community in
hilly southwestern New Hampshire speculating on what happened.
Rumors spread rapidly from talk at the general store, at Vic's, the
only restaurant in town, or at private gatherings.
   Mabel Champney, who knew the elder Chambers for 45 years and had
been dating him the past three years since the death of his wife,
emphatically rejected any thought that he would hide a crime.
   ``I don't think he knew a thing about it,'' she said. ``I don't
think he would hold back anything if someone did something wrong.''
   Harry Briggs, the elder Chambers' brother-in-law, said Melissa
Chambers was ``very bitter against Bob,'' something that had
``built through the years. They always fought back and forth.''
   Bean helped Chambers build the 1{-story cabin where he still
lives, one town resident said. The house sits on two acres
remaining from the 100 acres once owned by Chambers' father.
   The Union Leader in Manchester quoted people as saying Chambers
and his wife and Bean and his wife were good friends.
   But then Robert and Deborah Chambers separated in 1978 and
divorced in June 1979.
   Bean disappeared in September 1978, and Sylvia Bean won a
divorce the next year. She and Chambers were married in September
1979.
   Chambers was a trainee and was ready to become a full-time
policeman for Winchester after passing a 10-week course at the
state police academy, but the digging began the day he graduated.

<HEAD>INS Officials Turn To Hoopla To Spur Interest</HEAD>

   Federal officials disappointed by lukewarm response to a
year-long amnesty program for illegal aliens hope a blitz of
sideshow-like hoopla in the final weeks will spark a last-minute
flurry of interest.
   ``We are expecting to see a surge in applications,'' Immigration
and Naturalization Service spokesman Vern Jervis said in
Washington, D.C.
   ``Our feeling is there has been a lot of procrastination. But we
already have seen an increase in recent weeks, and we believe we
will have good numbers between now and the end of the program as
people realize time is getting short.''
   The last day illegal aliens can apply for amnesty to legalize
their presence in this country and permit them to seek citizenship
is May 4. The program began May 5, 1987.
   After an initial surge that saw illegal aliens standing in long
lines for hours at INS centers around the country, interest tapered
off substantially.
   When the amnesty program started, officials estimated there were
between 4 million and 6 million illegal aliens in the United States
and that between 2 million and 4 million might apply for amnesty.
   Through March 16, the latest date for which figures were
available, 1.39 million undocumented aliens had applied for
amnesty, Jervis said.
   Critics claim the government mismanaged the amnesty program by
failing to adequately publicize it and failing to overcome illegal
aliens' ingrained distrust of the INS, perceived in the past only
as the agency that wanted to hunt them down and deport them.
   In recent weeks, INS officials have waged aggressive programs to
spread the message that the amnesty program will end soon.
   ``We have done everything except stand on our heads,'' said
William King, who oversees the amnesty program for the INS Western
region, including California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam.
   The efforts have ranged from sponsoring old-fashioned
neighborhood block parties and participating in ethnic parades to
speaking to community groups, at Catholic Masses in the Southwest
and West and Baptist services in the South, and on radio talks
shows nationwide.
   Some of the more unusual schemes include stuffing messages about
the deadline inside packages of tortillas and in fortune cookies.
   Critics point out that most fortune cookies are eaten by
middle-class Caucasians.
   INS workers also have donned sombreros at Hispanic festivities,
hugged babies at Chinese, Korean and Southeast Asian gatherings,
and swaddled themselves in Polynesian costumes and roasted pigs at
``Tongan Night'' parties. They have tried to reach sports fans by
hiring planes trailing amnesty messages to fly over stadiums and
have flashed messages on electronic stadium signboards.
   In McAllen, Texas, INS worker Art Zuniga wrote a song in Spanish
entitled ``Amnistia'' and persuaded local radio stations to play it
often. In some neighborhoods, Boy Scouts have been enlisted to go
door-to-door handing out leaflets.
   In recent weeks, INS officials with much fanfare staged
ceremonies to present temporary residency permits, commonly known
as ``green cards,'' to a 98-year-old woman in Texas and a
101-year-old man in California. In each case, the person was billed
as the oldest undocumented alien to receive legal status.
   In other nations where similar amnesty programs have been
offered, 10 percent of all applications came on the last day, not
unlike the way people file their tax returns, King said.
   ``If that happens, we're going to be out there with mail bags
accepting applications until 11:59 p.m., May 4,'' King said.
   To make it easier for people to get amnesty, the INS announced
Friday it would accept applications that are simply filled out and
signed by May 4. Those applying will have an additional 60 days to
supply the documentation required to suport the applications.
   Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, illegal
aliens who have lived in this country continuously since before
Jan. 1, 1982, are eligible to seek amnesty. The process costs
applicants $185 per person up to a maximum of $420 per family, plus
a $75 counseling fee and a $10 photo and fingerprint fee.

<HEAD>Soviet General Blasts Recent NATO Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent NATO summit in Brussels proved that the
Western alliance is trying to unilaterally disarm the Soviet Union
so it can achieve military superiority, a top Soviet general said
in an article published Sunday.
   Gen. Sergei Akhromeyev, chief of the general staff of the Soviet
armed forces, said in the Defense Ministry newspaper, Krasnaya
Zvezda, that NATO was unreasonably seeking cuts in Soviet
conventional military forces.
   ``One draws an absolutely definite conclusion that the NATO
leadership is trying to impose unilateral disarmament upon
socialist countries, to break the existing structure of the Soviet
general-purpose forces and in the final account, attain military
superiority,'' Akhromeyev said.
   A March 3 declaration by leaders of North Atlantic Treaty
Organization countries called for cuts in Soviet conventional
military forces. NATO says the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact has a 2-1
advantage in tanks and artillery.
   But Akhromeyev reiterated the Soviet view that NATO and the
Warsaw Pact are roughly equal in strength. While NATO calls for a
reduction in tanks and artillery, it is superior in aircraft and
sea power, the general said.
   Akhromeyev also criticized NATO for refusing to link
conventional arms and reduction or elimination of tactical, or
long-range, nuclear missiles.
   The Soviet Union is willing to meet the West halfway, ``but its
initiatives should be reciprocated by the other side. It is just a
waste of time to demand unilateral disarmament from the USSR,'' he
said.
   NATO has not directly responded to a Warsaw Pact proposal made
in June 1986 for a comprehensive plan to cut military forces
throughout Europe, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Soviet Union's
Ural Mountains, he said.

<HEAD>Pinning Down The Real Dukakis _ Not An Easy Task</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, chatting with laid-off
steelworkers on Chicago's East Side, was munching on a big, messy
Danish pastry. But _ not wanting to get his breakfast all over his
crisp business suit _ he was eating it with a spoon, to the
amusement of the rough-hewn onlookers.
   This prim approach illustrated what the Democratic presidential
candidate from Massachusetts freely admitted to Chicagoans in a
campaign ad narrated by bricklayers union chief Tommy McIntyre:
``He's not your shot-and-beer kind of guy.''
   But in the course of Dukakis' campaign, it's often been easier
to figure out what kind of a guy Dukakis isn't than what kind he is.
   In Iowa, Dukakis crusaded against aid to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels. In New Hampshire, he pushed his opposition to the Seabrook
nuclear plant. And he spoke out against space-based missile
defenses and additions to a Navy carrier task force.
   But in the South, Dukakis said he would fight communist
aggression in Central America, and he reminded voters that he has
cut taxes and kept the state budget balanced.
   In Illinois, he portrayed himself as a friend to labor while
largely steering clear of substantive issues. Instead, he spoke
about the need to pick a candidate who can win in November.
   The multiple portraits of the Massachusetts governor reflect a
conscious campaign strategy to seek the broadest support possible.
In some ways it has paid off.
   On Super Tuesday, for example, Dukakis won in all regions of the
country. And although he finished third in Illinois last week,
Dukakis did equally well among liberals, moderates and
conservatives, according to exit polls.
   When NBC News asked Illinois voters which Democratic candidate
was more conservative, the choices included Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt. On the most-liberal list
were Jesse Jackson and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon. Only one
candidiate was on both lists _ Michael Dukakis.
   ``Dukakis has to have some image,'' said pollster Sheldon
Gawiser. ``Is he tough? I don't know. Is he compassionate? I don't
know. Is he new? I don't know. Is he old? I don't know.''
   Dukakis has promised not to reduce spending on social programs
and to increase college scholarship programs for needy high school
graduates. He wants a $500 million ``partnership'' between the
public and private sectors to invest in economically depressed
areas. He talks about protecting the environment.
   More often, though, Dukakis has stuck to a generalized stump
speech that only touches lightly on his policy views. His Super
Tuesday victory speech, delivered in Chicago, was filled with
phrases like, ``You don't have to be from Chicago to want a
president who will make America No. 1 again,'' and ``The best
America isn't behind us; the best America is yet to come.''
   Even in Massachusetts, where Dukakis has been in public life as
a legislator and governor for 25 years, labels don't stick fast to
Dukakis, because his positions don't fit conventional pigeonholes.
   Dukakis was a reform-minded liberal when he first won the
governorship in 1974. He succeeded a popular Republican chief
executive and inherited an enormous budget deficit.
   Those deficits forced Dukakis to break his promise of no new
taxes, a move some believe cost him his job four years later. Yet
he also lost liberal support in that same race because he approved
reuctions in welfare benefits.
   ``1978 was ...the turning point in his political life,'' wrote
Robert Turner and Charles Kenney in their recent biography of the
governor. ``Political pragmatism dictated what changed. It was not
an alteration in character, but a shift in style, approach _ a
change he had to make if he was to be successful again in
politics.''
   What Dukakis calls ``an involuntary four-year sabbatical'' at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government kept him in touch with
Massachusetts politics and exposed him to a pool of talent that he
has since tapped for his presidential campaign. The governor's
staff is dotted with former students and faculty members from the
Kennedy school.
   In 1982, Dukakis defeated arch-rival Gov. Edward King in a
bruising campaign in which Dukakis made it clear he considered the
King administration corrupt.
   His second term was marked by its pragmatism and emphasis on
encouraging business expansion. The four years between 1982 and
1986 found Dukakis facing protests from welfare recipients who
claimed their benefits kept them far below the poverty level and
from gays and lesbians who accused him of discriminating against
homosexuals by forbidding them from being foster parents.
   In the South, Dukakis, addressing his image as a cool
problem-solver, commented a tag many have been eager to pin on him.
   ``I have a defintion of a technocrat,'' he said. ``A liberal who
can balance a budget.''

<TEXT>
   Texas playwright Larry L. King is scratching
his beard in puzzlement.
   His blockbuster musical, ``The Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas,'' ran on Broadway for 1,588 performances to rave reviews,
spawned four national touring companies, played on four continents,
became a hit movie and has grossed more than $175 million at last
count.
   But when he mailed the script of his latest play, ``The Night
Hank Williams Died,'' to a big New York producer, it was returned a
week later stamped ``UNSOLICITED MATERIALS NOT ACCEPTED.''
   Other producers and theater directors responded with polite
yawns, broken promises, excuses or no response at all.
   Ford's Theater in Washington didn't bother to acknowledge
receipt of his manuscript.
   ``Perhaps I should have sent them `The Night Abe Lincoln
Died,''' King says.
   After investing four years and an estimated $7,000 in travel,
phone calls, postage, script copying and lawyers' fees, King
finally got his play on the boards at Washington's small,
financially struggling New Playwrights' Theater, where it finished
a successful five-week run in early March.
   It's something of a humbling and perplexing experience for King,
who already has 11 books, five stage plays, four television
documentaries, hundreds of magazine articles, a TV Emmy and
nominations for Tony and National Book awards to his credit.
   But the playwright shrugs off suggestions that New Playwrights'
was a humiliating comedown after the bright lights of Broadway.
   During the day, King hustled tickets by phone and delivered show
posters to swank downtown restaurants where his pals dined without
him.
   On arriving at the 125-seat theater near Dupont Circle, his
first job was to wash coffee cups for the cast and crew. Then he
donned costume and makeup to perform a starring role in his own
play, seven times a week.
   King has concluded that getting plays produced anywhere in
America is ``a perpetual crapshoot,'' no matter how famous the
playwright.
   ``This is not as good as Billy Dick's stuff,'' King said in a
recent interview, using his down-home nickname for William
Shakespeare. ``But I know this is not a bad play.''
   The critics agree. And a New Playwrights' spokeswoman, Paige
Gold, said ``it was the biggest ticket-seller we've had this
season.''
   ``The Night Hank Williams Died'' is not a play about the
legendary country western singer. It's about the death of ``a
dreamer in a dreamless land,'' a former high school football star
named Thurmond Stottle who's pumping gas in a small west Texas
town, working on a beer gut and desperate to escape.
   King tells the tale, both funny and sad, with dialogue as hot
and spicy as three-alarm chili and the indisputable truth of a man
who's been there himself. Unlike Stottle, who was gunned down
before he could flee with his guitar and his dream of singing fame
in Nashville, Tenn., King made good his escape from west Texas.
   He began his writing career as a reporter on a string of small
newspapers in Texas and New Mexico before he moved to Washington in
1954 as a congressional aide. While working for Rep. Jim Wright,
D-Texas, now House speaker, King finished his first book, a
political novel titled ``The One-Eyed Man.''
   Today, while trying to arrange future engagements for ``Hank
Williams'' in Texas theaters and a possible Off-Broadway run this
fall, King is finishing his 12th book, a largely autobiographical
anti-war novel called ``War Movies.''
   At the same time, he's working on another play, ``The Golden
Shadows Old West Museum,'' which is tentatively scheduled to
premiere next season at the Arkansas Repertory Theater in Little
Rock.
   ``It's a helluva hard way to make a living,'' said King, 59, as
he lit another cigarette and brushed his blue jeans in the den of
his comfortable home in a wooded section of northwest Washington.
   Because of enormous production costs and limited financial
resources, he says, most theaters play it safe in favor of proven
hits. ``There just aren't that many theaters willing to do new
plays,'' he said.
   He finds it ``very peculiar'' that the author of the wildly
successful ``Whorehouse'' would have so much difficulty finding a
producer for his new play, even in Texas where he is immensely
popular.
   ``All I can figure is those folks don't have much imagination,''
he said. ``When you send in your manuscripts, you just don't hear
from theaters. I don't know if they open their mail or even see it.
That's not good manners, much less good business.''

<HEAD>Star Wars Expected To Be One of Reagan's Chief Legacies</HEAD>

   After five years of debate about futuristic
space weapons, both supporters and critics of President Reagan's
Star Wars system agree that the program will remain one of Reagan's
chief legacies after he leaves office next year.
   ``There is no way this program will die when Reagan leaves
office, regardless of who is elected in November,'' said John Pike
of the Federation of American Scientists, a chief critic of
Reagan's program.
   ``There's a constituency for the program now and that means it
is here to stay,'' Pike said. ``The next president, whether
Republican or Democrat, is going to have limited options. He won't
be able to significantly raise it because of budget restrictions,
but he won't be able to cut it deeply, either.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee and another critic of the missile defense system, agreed.
``Politically, the Star Wars issue is here to stay. It's not going
to go away,'' Aspin said.
   And on the other side, retired Air Force Gen. Daniel Graham, who
is one of Reagan's strongest supporters, said, ``I believe that it
is almost inexorable that the program will continue to grow. The
debate has been changed.''
   ``We are making progress. The debate now is about what kind of
system, not whether any defense at all is a good idea,'' said Air
Force Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, head of the program.
   The debate began almost as soon as Reagan proposed the idea five
years ago at the end of a nationally televised speech. In the
speech, Reagan referred to the current nuclear doctrine of mutual
assured destruction, which holds that each superpower is deterred
from a nuclear attack against the other because of the threat of
devastating retaliation.
   Science, Reagan said, should be devoted to defense, not offense,
and he laid out his dream of building a defensive system that would
``free the world from the threat of nuclear war.''
   Reagan dubbed his plan the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI),
although Pike and other critics began calling it ``Star Wars,''
after the hit movie, a name that stuck.
   One of the strongest supporters of the program was Graham, head
of a private foundation known as High Frontier, and the chief
advocate of deploying a system of orbiting ``garages'' full of
rockets that could be readily fired at attacking Soviet missiles.
   The United States had been devoting hundreds of millions of
dollars to defensive research before Reagan's speech, but the
president's interest changed the program and set off a national
debate about whether such a system could be built and what it would
cost.
   Originally, Pentagon officials said the program would look at a
variety of exotic, futuristic weapons, such as neutral particle
beams, electromagnetic rail guns and electron lasers.
   But many of those technologies have not panned out and while
research on them is continuing, the program is now concentrating
almost half its $4.2 billion budget on a so-called ``phase one''
defense that would, at best, be able to knock out less than half
the Soviet land-based nuclear missiles.
   That would still leave hundreds of land-based rockets to attack
the United States, along with submarine-based missiles and Soviet
bombers.
   ``They haven't really come up with a successful technology
yet,'' Pike said. ``In fact, they've had a lot more success
eliminating some things, such as the rail guns and the really
exotic stuff.''
   Among the chief critics of Star Wars have been a succession of
Soviet leaders, particularly Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the current
Soviet leader.
   Gorbachev has warned time and again that Star Wars is the major
hurdle to a U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating half the thousands of
atomic weapons each side has aimed at each other. But Reagan has
adamantly refused to agree to any limits on Star Wars research.
   Gorbachev has also warned that the Soviets are working on a
system to counter SDI. At last December's summit meeting in
Washington, he said, ``If the Americans have a lot of money, let
them squander it on SDI. We will look for a response along other,
asymmetrical lines that will be less expensive.''
   U.S. officials no longer talk about the possibility of
eliminating nuclear weapons. Instead, they say SDI will make it
more difficult for the Soviets to be sure of knocking out American
weapons in any attack, thus making it harder for the Soviets to
attack.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, in his annual report to
Congress, said, ``the deterrent value of strategic defenses derives
from the effect these defenses would have on Soviet calculations on
the costs and benefits of launching an attack.''
   ``This type of defense would enable us to influence the Soviet
decision-maker's calculus by diminishing his confidence in the
ability of his forces to execute an effective attack, rather than
by increasing the severity of our retaliation,'' he said. ``A
strategic defense need not be `leak-proof' to achieve this
objective.''
   Star Wars also has been the subject of annual congressional
fights over spending. The Democratic-controlled Congress has
consistently reduced SDI spending.
   Reagan took aim at Congress last week, when he said Capitol Hill
``should realize it's no longer a question of whether there will be
an SDI program or not _ the only question will be whether the
Soviets are the only ones who have strategic defenses while the
United States remains entirely defenseless.''
   While the debate goes on, so does the research, particularly on
the so-called ``phase one'' system.
   The plan is based on a system of 200 to 400 orbiting satellites,
each of which would have 10 so-called ``kinetic kill vehicles,'' or
rockets, that would destroy a target by slamming into it at high
speeds.
   The Pentagon declines to estimate the cost of phase one, but the
Congressional Research Service recently said the bill could come to
more than $200 billion.
   Pike said one of the main obstacles to SDI eventually will be
the budget. ``You've already seeing intense competition for Defense
Department dollars and that will only increase in the future,'' he
said.

   Anti-apartheid activists
pledged to defy authorities Monday in the first nationwide protest
since the government banned leading black opposition groups last
month.
   Pamphlets urging a general strike were circulating through black
townships in defiance of government regulations. Police have
threatened action against strike organizers and promised to protect
blacks wishing to work.
   Organizers called for the one-day strike to commemorate the 28th
anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre and protest banning of the
United Democratic Front and other groups.
   The front, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition,
coordinated previous nationwide protests during the 21-month-old
state of emergency. Emergency regulations outlaw calls for strikes
and boycotts, but hundreds of thousands of black workers and
students have joined past protests by staying away from jobs and
schools.
   In Soweto, one major protest meeting was held Sunday at a Roman
Catholic Church. Speakers from some of the organizations which have
been restricted addressed a crowd of more than 1,500.
   Police entered the church during the meeting to ask that the
participants stop singing freedom songs, but the songs resumed
after the officers left, according to people at the church.
   Services were scheduled Monday in several cities and townships
to mark the anniversary of the 1960 massacre in Sharpeville, a
township south of Johannesburg. Sixty-nine blacks were killed and
about 180 injured when police fired on thousands of demonstrators
protesting pass laws, repealed in 1986. Those laws restricted
freedom of movement as part of the national apartheid system of
racial segregation.
   Several affiliates of the United Democratic Front that were
unaffected by the ban took out newspaper advertisements announcing
Monday's protest.
   ``The depth and extent of our people's anger about the bannings
has surprised even us,'' said a statement issued by the affiliates.
``Not sated with the whole country under the state of emergency and
hundreds filling the prison cells, the regime is turning to
blocking all avenues of peaceful protest.''
   The predominantly white University of Cape Town and mostly
mixed-race University of the Western Cape were shutting down Monday
in solidarity with the protest. Monday's performance of ``District
Six,'' a musical with an anti-apartheid theme playing to full
houses in Johannesburg, was also canceled.
   Sharpeville made news again last week because Friday had been
set as execution date for six black prisoners, known as the
``Sharpeville Six.'' They were convicted of complicity in the mob
killing of a black town councilor during anti-apartheid riots in
1984.
   President P.W. Botha rejected worldwide appeals for clemency,
but a Supreme Court judge granted a one-month stay of execution
Thursday to consider defense claims of lying by a key witness.

<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand on Sunday promised to
reveal this week whether he will seek re-election, a question that
has kept the country in suspense for months.
   ``I hear you, believe me. It seems you want me to tell you
today, today about tomorrow,'' Mitterrand said in a videotaped
message to a political rally of 20,000 Socialists and presidential
supporters in the Paris suburb of Bourget.
   Political pundits predict Mitterrand will announce his plans at
a meeting of the Socialist Party in Strasbourg on Friday, just four
weeks before voters go to the polls.
   Guessing about the Socialist president's plans has become
something of a parlor game in France. Sometimes the 71-year-old
president has hinted he would like to retire, but on other
occasions has left the impression he would seek another term.
   The magazine Paris-Match has sponsored a contest asking readers
to guess whether Mitterrand will run, the day of his decision, and
the exact minute it will be announced. The winner will have income
taxes paid by the magazine for the seven-year term of the next
president.
   As the April 5 deadline nears for candidates to place their
names on the ballot, it seems increasingly likely Mitterrand will
run.
   Lionel Jospin, first secretary of the Socialist Party,
reinforced this impression in comments made to reporters before the
president's speech.
   ``To win, it is necessary that a candidate have the stature of a
president. We have it, or in any case in some days I am convinced
we are going to have it _ with Francois Mitterrand,'' Jospin said.
   Polls have consistently placed Mitterrand ahead of the two other
leading contenders for the presidency, conservative Premier Jacques
Chirac and former Premier Raymond Barre, the other main
conservative candidate.
   In fact, the first round of the election April 24 is regarded as
a sort of primary election between the rival conservatives. The
winner would then face Mitterrand _ if he runs _ in a decisive
second round May 8.
   A poll published in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper Sunday
showed 55 percent of the 1,813 people polled were satisfied with
Mitterrand. Forty-eight percent were satisfied with Chirac as
premier.
   A handful of minor-party contenders, including Andre Lejoinie of
the once powerful Communists, are expected to draw a total of 5
percent of the vote or less. Jean-Marie Le Pen of the extreme-right
National Front could get about 10 percent of the vote.
   Francois Cornut-Gentille, a political expert with the
independent SOFRES polling firm, said ``the right is divided
between Barre and Chirac, so Mitterrand is the unifier. He has the
image of ... a man of state.''
   The image has led to a groundswell of support for the president
who has enjoyed enormous popularity, despite his national
non-campaign. Independent campaigns have sprung up around the
country, gathering signatures and putting up posters for
``Tonton,'' Mitterrand's nickname, an affectionate term for uncle.
   Chirac spokesman Alain Juppe said Mitterrand's strategy has been
to ``remain outside the melee and continue to act like the father
of the country on his little pink cloud.''
   Some experts predict that when Mitterrand enters the political
fray his image may take a beating.

   Carol Pittas thought it was a little
strange when a passing motorist asked if the lion on the hill was
real. But after a few more passers-by asked the same question,
Pittas and her fellow Rip Van Winkle Bridge toll collectors thought
twice.
   Sure enough, a full-grown, 200-pound adult lioness was resting
just 25 feet from the entrance to the upstate Hudson River bridge
Friday night.
   ``It was just lying there and all these passing cars were asking
about it,'' Pittas said. ``One guy asked if he could keep it if he
caught it.''
   It seems the lioness was an escaped pet from a nearby river
estate. The owners were on vacation and somehow the lioness broke
free and found its way to the bridge approach, State Trooper Ron
Levin said.
   Police were called to the scene along with two animal handlers
from the nearby Catskill Game Farm to sedate the animal with a
tranquilizing gun.
   ``It wasn't too friendly,'' Levin said. ``And it got really
upset when it was shot.''
   When hit by the dart, the lioness roared and ran into an
adjacent wooded area and headed toward the river. Police and the
animal handlers followed.
   Animal handler Jurgen Schultz used a flashlight to find the cat
again and gave her another tranquilizing dart in the flank for
insurance.
   After the tranquilizer took effect, six men took the lioness out
of the woods on a stretcher and loaded her into a rescue van, Levin
said.
   The lioness was held at the Catskill Game Farm until the
feline's owner, Martin Kosich, picked it up late Saturday afternoon.

   Political wheels are turning in
an effort to prevent the navy from bailing out of the famous
Nanaimo-to-Vancouver bathtub race.
   The Canadian Armed Forces has provided a communications network,
boats and emergency personnel free of charge for the race ever
since it was first run in 1967. But organizers at the Loyal Nanaimo
Bathtub Society were told this year they would have to foot the
bill if the navy takes part.
   The move has spurred a lobbying effort by Nanaimo-Alberni
legislator Ted Schellenberg, who raised the issue in Parliament
last week.
   ``The citizens of Nanaimo call on the Department of National
Defense to once again take part in tubbing and to sail with those
who bail,'' the Progressive Conservative member of Parliament said.
   Bathtub society commodore John Ruttan said the pullout is a
serious concern for organizers of the summer event. Nanaimo Mayor
Frank Ney blamed the retreat on ``some bureaucratic paperslinger''
who interpreted department rules too closely.
   ``I'm quite sure that when the message gets to the right person,
the navy will be allowed to return,'' said Ney. ``They may even
make someone walk the plank.''
   The race with motorized tubs is about 20 miles long, from
Nanaimo on Vancouver Island to the mainland across Georgia Strait.

   A lightning bolt struck the minaret of a vacant
mosque on Sunday and sent it toppling onto the home of the
building's caretaker, killing one woman and seriously wounding a
child, police said.
   An eyewitness told Israel army radio: ``At noon fire came out of
the sky and struck the minaret of the mosque. At the top of the
minaret was a crescent made of copper. The lightning hit the
crescent and started a fire.''
   Police spokeswoman Dalia Gilad said the mosque, which was
abandoned during the 1948 Middle East war, was run down and badly
battered during heavy winter rains. It sits in an exclusively
Jewish suburb of Tel Aviv.
   It was looked after by Razi Deib, an Israeli Arab whose home was
inside the courtyard of the building.
   Gilad said stone blocks fell on Deib's house, killing his
mother-in-law, Naha Takos, 70, and seriously wounding his
3-year-old son, Ahmed Deib. Deib's wife suffered minor injuries.
Deib and two other children were not at home.
   The Israeli news agency Itim said the mosque hadn't been used
for worship since 1948 but that Moslems came to the site to
celebrate family occasions and festivals.

<HEAD>Bishops To Meet About Government Threat Against Tutu</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglican bishops from
throughout southern Africa plan an emergency meeting this week to
discuss the threat of government action against Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, the church said Sunday.
   Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican Church in South
Africa, has been engaged in increasingly bitter confrontations with
the white-led government since last month, when it banned political
activity by leading black anti-apartheid groups.
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against
apartheid, was briefly detained three weeks ago when he and other
church leaders tried to march to Parliament with a petition
protesting the crackdown on opposition activity.
   He and other clergymen, including the Rev. Allan Boesak,
subsequently vowed to continue challenging the government. Boesak
is president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   South Africa's Anglican bishops, in a statement Sunday, said the
government has ``launched a carefully planned attack'' on Tutu and
Boesak ``aimed at portraying them as Marxists and isolating them
from their churches as a prelude to state action against them.''
   President P.W. Botha met with Tutu last week and suggested that
the archbishop had aligned himself with the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement.
   The bishops' meeting on Tuesday is to take place at Jan Smuts
Airport outside Johannesburg. The Right Rev. Keith Sutton, a bishop
from Litchfield, England, is to join African bishops at the meeting
as the representative of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Right
Rev. Robert Runcie.

   Watergate conspirator Jeb Stuart Magruder
says his past was the perfect prologue to his new post as the head
of the city's Commission on Values and Ethics, formed after scores
of people scooped up cash that fell from an armored car.
   Magruder, now a Presbyterian minister, was a deputy director of
communications in the Nixon White House and spent seven months in
jail for his role in the Watergate scandal.
   Magruder, 53, who calls Watergate one of the greatest ethical
scandals of modern times, said in an interview that what he learned
from Watergate qualifies him to lead the 15-member panel of
business, education and religious leaders.
   ``Watergate happened 15 years ago. Since that period of time, I
have spent most of my life in preparation for the ministry and in
the ministry. And in doing that I took on as kind of my issue _
because of Watergate I'm sure _ the issue of ethics. That
automatically hit a responsive chord in me,'' he said, laughing.
   Magruder was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1981 and since
has divided his time between his duties at First Community Church
and speaking to groups around the state about ethics. He is almost
finished writing a book on the subject.
   ``I do have a fairly unique kind of a pattern to discuss ...
being involved in one of the great scandals of our country, which
was an ethical scandal,'' he said. ``And studying ethics from a
theological viewpoint, I have come to some conclusions about what
is happening in this life.''
   Those conclusions include a major change from his code of ethics
in the Watergate era.
   ``If they haven't changed, then it has been a real waste of
time, hasn't it?'' he said.
   The commission's goal is to generate discussion of ethics and
values by city residents. To that end, it is sponsoring a forum
April 23 featuring Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., plans presentations
in schools and eventually will distribute a questionnaire posing
ethical questions that it hopes will spur consideration of the
issues.
   It was the brainchild of Mayor Dana Rinehart and others,
including Magruder, who have gathered monthly for informal lunch
meetings since last fall. Their talk turned to values and ethics in
October after the rear door of an armored car flew open and bags of
cash spilled onto Interstate 71.
   An estimated 200 people converged on the freeway, some to gawk
but most to scoop up flying bills.
   A telephone worker was given a mayoral proclamation and a reward
for returning $57,000, but many others kept the money.
   How much cash was lost and how much was recovered has never been
publicly released, but published figures estimate that as much as
$1 million may have fallen from the truck.
   ``I wasn't surprised people didn't return the money,'' Magruder
said. ``But ... that same week, a poll came out that said something
like 90 percent of the state wants honesty as its key factor in its
elected officials, yet when people were polled about whether they
would have taken the money on the freeway, 60-some percent of them
said they would.
   ``When you have that kind of hypocrisy in the body politic,
you're going to have confusion.''
   Rinehart said he wasn't surprised either, but began to think
more about values and ethics when he talked to his three children
about it.
   ``They didn't have a clear-cut answer. They said it probably
didn't matter since the money was insured and then they said that
nobody would know if they kept it,'' Rinehart said. ``I couldn't
believe it. I said, `You'd know.'
   ``That's why we have the commission, to get a grip on where our
values and ethics are and spark a little discussion, to get rid of
this myopic view some of have of reality. I really don't think the
Rolex watch and BMW neighborhoods are fulfilling people anymore.
People need more in their lives.''

   The owner of a popular bar where a bomb
blast injured 13 people, including five American servicemen, said
Sunday that he had never received threats or warnings of an attack.
   No extremist organization claimed responsibility for the blast
at popular Oscar's Bar, and Greek police said the Saturday night
attack did not fit the style of Greek terrorist organizations.
   The blast smashed windows and collapsed the bar's wooden ceiling
but caused no serious injuries. About 25 people _ Greeks, Britons
and Americans _ were drinking when the bomb went off.
   ``People round here know us as an American hangout but I never
got any threatening calls,'' said the bar's owner, Panayotis
Papoulias.
   The four Americans injured suffered cuts and puncture wounds and
were released after treatment from the hospital at Hellenikon Air
Force Base, an American Embassy official said.
   A statement issued by the base identified the Americans as Air
Force Staff Sgts. Larry Morrison, Timothy Johnson, Ricky Hoover and
John Fines, all serving at Hellenikon. Their ages and hometowns
were not given.
   The statement said a fifth serviceman, Staff Sgt. Michael
Grasta, had been examined by medics at the scene of the explosion.
   ``It was the first time I'd been to Oscar's, and I was standing
at the counter with my drink, there was a big noise and I saw the
bar blow up in front of me,'' said Costas Pabalos, 25, a Greek man
who suffered first-degree burns.
   A police spokesman said fragments of a timing device were found
among debris in the bar, indicating the bomb went off as planned at
11:10 p.m.
   Oscar's is a well-known meeting place for Americans in the
seaside suburb of Glyfada, close to the Hellenikon Base.
   More than 1,200 Americans are stationed at the 7206 Air Base
Group at Hellenikon, next to Athens International Airport.
   A spokesman at the Asklipeion Voula Hospital where the injured
were taken said two Britons, identified as Christine Slater and
John Summers, 24, were released Sunday.
   The spokesman said four Greeks were still hospitalized.
   The explosion came two weeks after a Greek left-wing terrorist
organization, November 17, claimed responsibility for killing a
leading Greek businessman, but a senior police official said there
was no indication the attacks were linked.
   ``This bombing doesn't follow the style of any known Greek
terrorist group,'' the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   November 17 has claimed attacks against Americans in the past,
including bombings in April and August 1987 against buses carrying
U.S. servicemen in Athens. More than 30 Americans were injured in
the two attacks, one seriously.
   The group, which seeks immediate closure of American bases in
Greece, is named for the day in 1973 that troops crushed a student
rebellion against the 1967-74 right-wing dictatorship.
   Greece and the United States currently are negotiating a new
agreement for the four American military bases in Greece.
   The last bar bombing in Athens took place in February 1985. More
than 60 people, including 34 Americans, were injured in an
explosion at Bobby's Bar in Glyfada.
   No extremist group claimed responsibility for that attack and no
arrests were made.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When strikes shut down the rest of
the country, Panama Canal employees went to work. When flaming
barricades blocked downtown streets, roads to the canal were clear.
The crisis gripping the rest of the country has barely touched the
waterway so vital to Panama's economy.
   Even at the height of this week's protests, rioters demanding
the ouster of strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega avoided the
canal zone just outside the capital.
   Canal officials said the most serious problem was a transit
stoppage that made it impossible for many canal employees to get to
work.
   After last Wednesday's failed coup attempt and street riots, the
joint U.S.-Panamanian commission that has governed the canal since
1979 issued a reassuring statement.
   ``We expect surface transit to continue without interruption,''
said the canal's marine director, George Hull.
   But not everyone agrees.
   Capt. John Maher, president of the 230-member Panama Canal
Pilots Association, said continued political instability could
sound the waterway's death knell.
   Ship builders are already planning for the year 2000, when
Panama takes full control of the waterway, he explained, and they
must decide now whether new fleets will be small enough to fit
through the 110-foot-wide lock chambers.
   The association pilots guide ships large and small through the
canal, its locks and other installations.
   Maher fears that if builders have doubts about the canal's
future, they will opt to build larger ships. About 1,800 ships
worldwide are already too big to pass through the locks.
   An average of 33 ships a day pass through the 50-mile set of
locks and lakes. Canal officials said 37 made the trip the day of
the coup attempt and 39 passed through the next day, despite work
stoppages at ports on both sides of the waterway.
   Even the power outages that plagued the rest of the country did
not affect the canal because the commission generates its own power.
   The canal, along with offshore banking, a thriving re-export
industry and a large U.S. military presence, has made Panama the
most prosperous country in Central America. Canal revenues make up
about 10 percent of Panama's gross national product.
   In 1987, the canal made direct payments of $78.1 million to
Panama from toll revenue of just under $330 million. Much of the
rest of the revenue, which goes to maintenance, salaries and other
expenditures, also helped swell the national economy.
   But years of deficit spending also piled up a $4.5 billion
foriegn debt that led to civil unrest, capital flight and loss of
government income. Local banks have been closed for weeks because
the government could not provide them with enough money to cover a
run. Panama has no currency of its own and uses the U.S. dollar.
   The United States has been applying economic pressure in hopes
of forcing Noriega to resign. It cut off military and economic aid
and withheld $6.5 million in canal fees last week.
   The canal commission is sensitive about the problems the chaos
is creating for what it insists is a ``non-political maritime
waterway.'' Commission spokeswoman Mercedes Morris said the rioting
and unrest have unfairly frayed the waterway's reputation.
   Maher finds the cloud over the canal particularly galling
because of its smooth transition so far to direct Panamanian
control under a 1979 treaty with the United States.
   ``The Panamazation of the canal has been a great success,'' he
said.``And if the canal can come through the current problems
unscathed, the future is great.''
   The canal and the treaties returning it to Panama evoke fervent
nationalism.
   In 1979, the United States turned the Canal Zone over to Panama,
ending an era of American courts, postal services, police and even
a company store.
   But about 10,000 American troops are still stationed in bases in
Panama, home of the U.S. Southern Command, the nerve center for all
American military activity in Latin America. The canal treaties say
the U.S. bases will go at the end of the century.

   National security adviser Lt. Gen. Colin
Powell said Sunday the fighting between Nicaragua and Honduras is
basically over and the chance of involvement by U.S. troops in
combat is unlikely.
   ``I don't expect that they (the U.S. troops) will get anywhere
near the combat zone,'' Powell said. ``The combat zone is rapidly
disappearing as the Sandinistas appear to withdraw, and I don't
think there is any reasonable likelihood that they would be
anywhere near the combat zone or getting themselves in a combat
situation.''
   The Reagan administration dispatched 3,200 troops to Honduras
this week in response to the Nicaraguan incursion across the border
to destroy Contra rebel camps and supplies. The U.S. troops were to
participate in exercises far from the fighting.
   Powell, who appeared on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' said the exercises should be completed shortly and the
troops will return to the United States.
   ``I would expect that in a short period of time the exercise
will end and they will be on the way home,'' Powell said.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci had said Friday that U.S.
forces would remain in the region for 10 days and not take part in
border fighting between the two Central American nations.
   Powell said Sunday that based on ground fighting, ``the battle
is pretty much over. The Sandinistas have withdrawn. They're
apparently on their side of the border again. They appear to be in
a process of withdrawing or have withdrawn.''
   ``And our troops are 50-60-100 miles away from the site of
action, and no plans are being made to move them any closer,'' he
said. ``I see no prospect of their entering into a combat
situation.''
   Cease-fire talks between Nicaragua's Sandinista government and
leaders of the Contra forces were scheduled to resume Monday in
Managua, but the possibility of negotiations seemed slim in light
of the fighting.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who appeared on NBC-TV's
``Meet the Press,'' said he was uncertain about the future of the
peace talks.
   ``I think the likelihood is they will (resume), but I'm not
certain of that,'' Shultz said. ``There seems to be a certain
amount of maneuvering among the parties, but I think a reasonable
and sensible cease-fire would be a good thing. And so we're for
it.''
   Shultz also said the administration is examining a bipartisan
congressional plan of $48 million in new aid to the Contras,
including renewed authority for the CIA to deliver previously
stockpiled weapons.
   ``It's a very interesting plan. We're studying it,'' Shultz
said. ``(It) seems a little low on money, but it is an interesting
effort on their part and deserves careful study, and I hope that
something goes forward. It should go forward.''
   Powell denied published reports that the administration turned
down Honduran president Jose Azcona's request that U.S. helicopters
be used to ferry Honduran troops to the battle zone.
   The New York Times, quoting an unidentified senior
administration official, reported Sunday that the United States
rejected the Honduran proposal, which was never made formally.
   ``We did not say no,'' Powell said. ``We were in the process of
examining that request. It had some funding problems and some
policy problems. And before we had to answer definitely `yes' or
`no' or even get a formal request, we found another way to
exercise.''
   He did not specify what type of exercise, but the Times reported
that U.S. officials were able to persuade Honduras to accept a
joint training exercise in which U.S. helicopters would carry
Honduran troops to about 30 miles from the Nicaraguan border but
100 miles from the battle zone.
   ``We are not using U.S. airlift to move Honduran troops to the
scene of the action at the Bocay,'' Powell said, referring to the
major battle site.
   Powell denied that he had misled Congress when he briefed
legislators on Wednesday and failed to mention that President
Reagan had decided, in principle, to send troops to Honduras if
Azcona asked.
   ``We did not go into the specific options because we did not
want it all over the newspapers,'' Powell said.
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., in an interview on
CBS-TV's ``Face The Nation,'' contended the administration did
mislead Congress about plans to send U.S. troops to Honduras.
   ``I think that what happened is that we were being briefed at
4:30 in the afternoon on day and they had made a decision that
morning to go down. And they told us in that meeting that it was
not even under consideration to send troops down to Honduras,''
Coelho said.
   ``I think that what is happening here is that we are being
misled, or we were being misled,'' he added.

<DATELINE>BATH, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower viewed his role in
the 1944 invasion of France as the high point of his career, his
son John Eisenhower said as he helped launch the first Navy ship
named the Normandy.
   Former Ambassador to Belgium John Eisenhower, the only surviving
child of the World War II military hero who went on to serve two
terms in the White House, said Saturday the invasion demonstrated
the need then and now for a naval fleet capable of delivering
forces anywhere in the world.
   ``A strong naval fleet keeps the American way of life viable,''
he told the 4,500 spectators who watched the 567-foot-long
Normandy, an Aegis guided missile cruiser, slide down the ways at
Bath Iron Works' shipyard.
   ``I feel like I am representing my father, who regarded his role
in the Normandy invasion as a high point in a long career of
service,'' Eisenhower said, recalling how he accompanied his father
to the beaches of Normandy nine days after the Allies' June 6,
1944, landing.
   The Allied Expeditionary Force of 9,000 ships and landing craft,
headed by the late general, carried 176,000 troops, 20,000 vehicles
and 1,500 tanks across the English Channel to reopen the western
front against Nazi Germany.
   U.S. Sen. George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, said the new ship's name
``is a reminder of the purpose for which she was constructed _ to
protect American interests at sea.''
   The Normandy, the third Aegis cruiser to be built at the Maine
shipyard, was sponsored by Gayle Wilson, wife of U.S. Sen. Pete
Wilson, R-Calif. As Mrs. Wilson broke a bottle over the Normandy's
bow, scores of brightly colored balloons were released into the air.
   The ship, which will have a crew of 375, is expected to be
completed in about 18 months, when it will be commissioned, said
Bath Iron Works spokesman Jim McGregor.

<HEAD>First Israeli Soldier Killed in Palestinian Protests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gunman opened fire at
close range Sunday on a reserve soldier standing guard near a
Palestinian refugee camp, marking the first Israeli army fatality
in four months of unrest in the occupied lands.
   The army's chief of staff, St. Gen. Dan Shomron, said the
shooting could augur greater use of guns by Palestinian activists.
He stopped short of saying it signaled a major change in the
tactics of protesters, who have mainly hurled stones and bottles at
Israel's occupation forces.
   ``I don't think we can yet see this as a shift to an armed
struggle,'' he said.
   But Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin indicated stronger action
would be taken to quell Palestinian uprisings.
   ``To the extent that extremist Palestinian terrorist elements
try to combine terrorist acts with the civilian disturbances, we
will have to adjust our operations and take harsher measures to
cope with both,'' he said.
   The army identified the slain soldier as Sgt. Moshe Katz, 28,
from the northern port city of Haifa.
   He was shot two or three times in the head at close range while
guarding a government building facing the small Beit Jibrin
Palestinian refugee camp in this biblical city, the military said.
   Troops immediately sealed off the road, the main tourist route
from Jerusalem to the city's Manger Square, the site of Christ's
birth. They also slapped a curfew on the refugee camp and ``rounded
up everyone who was in the area'' for questioning, an army
spokesman said.
   Shortly after the killing, a dozen Israeli soldiers guarded
about 100 Palestinians in front of shops. Soldiers led them away in
small groups for questioning.
   Rabin and Shomron rushed to the scene.
   ``It's a painful day, but we are determined to go on to make
sure security will prevail in Israel and the territories,'' Rabin
said later at the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City, the most
sacred site in Judaism.
   He told a group of supporters that the protests in the occupied
territories had the same goal as the Arab wars against Israel:
``The purpose is through the use of force to get rid of us.''
   Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij said the situation in the
territories ``will be aggravated'' by the shooting. But he blamed
the frustration of Arab protesters on Israel's occupation of lands
captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``The key to calming down the situation is in the hands of the
(Israeli) minister of defense and the government,'' he said.
   Freij said that the army had used welding torches during the two
previous days to seal 20 shops that were following hours mandated
by the Palestine Liberation Organization. He said souvenir shops on
Manger Square had been shuttered for six days because of
conflicting army and PLO demands.
   In Gaza City, troops closed the main vegetable market for three
hours after firing tear gas to disperse Arab youths who blocked a
main street and hurled stones at troops, Arab reporters said.
   Israelis have been using economic pressure in addition to
military force in trying to quell the unrest. They have cut
international telephone lines and blocked fuel shipments.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat has said throughout the unrest that he
ordered his followers to forgo use of guns against Israeli forces.
The army has reported only scattered cases of Arabs shooting at
soldiers or civilians.
   Last Thursday, an Israeli civilian was shot in the legs near a
refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Israeli troops have killed 103 Palestinians since Dec. 8,
according to United Nations figures.
   The Arab-run Palestine Press Service said two more Palestinians
died Sunday of wounds suffered in earlier clashes with soldiers,
but these were not confirmed by the army.
   Katz's killing took place a day before what underground leaders
were billing as potentially the most severe confrontations yet. A
recent communique circulated in the Gaza Strip and West Bank called
for major protests Monday. They were aimed at marking the 1968
battle of Karameh, when PLO fighters helped repel an Israeli force
that attacked a guerrilla base in Jordan.
   In other West Bank violence, the army said Israeli troops shot
and killed a 26-year-old Arab late Saturday when their patrol was
attacked with firebombs in the village of Kfar Dan, about 50 miles
north of Jerusalem. The Arab-run Palestine Press Service identified
the victim as Nameq Milhem.
   Israel Radio said the death resulted from new orders calling for
soldiers to shoot at Arabs who throw firebombs.

<HEAD>Congressional Study Backs `Midgetman' Missile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``Midgetman'' atomic-tipped missile is a
good idea that can do more to improve U.S. nuclear deterrence than
putting MX nuclear missiles aboard trains, according to a House
Armed Services study released Sunday.
   The report by the Democratic-controlled panel was the latest
round in a long-running fight between the Pentagon and Congress
over the best type of land-based nuclear weapons to build.
   The report was critical of Air Force plans to put MX weapons
aboard trains for transport on the nation's railways during times
of crisis.
   ``The Air Force is assuming that because MX would be roaming
commercial rail lines only in times of international crisis, public
resistance to launch-ready missiles in boxcars will evaporate,''
said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the panel.
   ``Maybe that's true, but the Air Force has no evidence to
support the assumption. On the other hand, rail-basing schemes have
been shelved twice in the past because of public opposition,'' he
said.
   But the Air Force was sharply critical of Aspin.
   ``There he goes again,'' Gen. Larry Welch, Air Force chief of
staff, said, referring to previous Aspin criticism of Air Force
atomic weapons that the service says was unfounded.
   In a statement, the service said the rail-basing plan ``has been
subjected to a rigorous, analytical, and careful acquisition
process,'' and it said civilians would support the idea.
   The dispute has its roots in the bitter fights during President
Reagan's first term about whether the build the MX as a successor
to the aging Minuteman missiles, which are the heart of the U.S.
land-based atomic deterrent force.
   Reagan wanted 100 of the 10-warhead weapons, but Congress cut
the total to 50 because of fears that the large number of warheads
on each missiles, combined with their placement in stationary
silos, would make them easy targets for Soviet attack.
   A presidential commission said the MX program should go ahead,
but should eventually be succeeded by a single-warhead weapon,
dubbed Midgetman. Aspin became one of the biggest champions of the
Midgetman and tentative plans were drawn up to build a force of 500
of the weapons and put them in Western silos.
   But Pentagon budget cuts in recent years have forced a revision
of the plans to buy both the MX and Midgetman, and Air Force and
Pentagon officials have made clear that their choice would be
purchasing more MX weapons.
   In addition to the 50 MX weapons approved for land-based silos,
the Air Force wants to build 50 more and put two on each of 25
trains.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told Congress last month
that he preferred to kill the Midgetman program outright, but
consented to including $200 million in next year's Air Force budget
so it could be kept alive until a new administration makes a final
decision.
   The House panel's study noted that a force of 500 Midgetman
weapons would cost an estimated $40 billion, but pointed out that
the figure has decreased from the $57 billion estimate when the
program was first proposed four years ago.
   By contrast, putting the MX aboard railroads would cost an
estimated $13.8 billion, the study noted.
   Aspin said that the Midgetman cost figures, which would make it
the most expensive weapons program in the Pentagon, could be
reduced as part of the effort to cut defense spending.
   ``Giving each missile two warheads would cut the number of
deployed missiles in half, or it may be that the job can be
accomplished with fewer than 500 single-warhead missiles,'' Aspin
said.
   The report said the Midgetman ``program appears to be operating
under a sound acquisition strategy emphasizing risk reduction,
competition and a realistic schedule at a time when some strategic
programs are experiencing severe difficulties.''
   But Air Force Secretary Edward Aldridge, noting the higher cost
estimates for the Midgetman, said Aspin's report took ``an
extremely narrow view of what is in the best interests of our
country'' because the money to pay for the more expensive weapon
would have to be taken out of the budget for on-nuclear weapons.
   ``The net result would be a decrease in our conventional
deterrence posture,'' Aldridge said in a statement.

   One man was ordered held without bail Sunday
in the drug-related abduction of three boys and the shooting deaths
of two of them as police searched for three other suspects,
authorities said.
   Police said they were looking for three Jamaican males, aged 16

   John Garrett, 25, was denied bail in connection with the deaths
of Anthony Williams, 13, and his brother, Cornell, 15, and held on
$1 million bail in connection with the abduction Joseph Jones, 12.
   The boys had been missing since last Saturday. Anthony Williams
was found Tuesday alongside a railroad track with a bullet wound in
his head and died Wednesday afternoon, police said.
   Garrett was arrested Friday after Jones told police he escaped
from kidnappers near Philadelphia International Airport early
Friday. The boy said he and the Williams brothers had been abducted
by drug dealers March 12 and forced to sell crack, a derivative of
cocaine.
   Cornell Williams was found dead near the airport Friday with two
bullet wounds in the head, the medical examiner's office said.

   Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on
Sunday publicly ruled out any peace settlement of his country's
7{-year-old war with Iraq.
   In a rare public appearance, Khomeini said Iran would press for
``final victory'' in the conflict. He said last week's Iranian
offensive in Iraq's northeastern Suleimaniyeh province constituted
``a slap on the face'' of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Khomeini urged his nation not to be ``deceived by foreign
propaganda'' in an apparent complaint that the international media
have ignored victories that Iran claims on the war front.
   The 87-year-old patriarch of the Iranian revolution made his
comments in a nationwide speech broadcast by Tehran television and
monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus. He spoke in a strong voice and looked
healthier than when he appeared on television earlier this year.
   His 15-minute speech marked Nowruz, the start of the Iranian new
year.
   Khomeini also urged Moslems worldwide to rise up against the
Soviet Union and the United States, describing them as ``forces of
oppression and evil.''
   ``The superpowers claim to advocate justice,'' he said. ``In
fact, all they want is to impose their will and make us obey them.''
   The national leader hailed ancient martyrs who sacrficed their
lives preaching Islam after the death of Prophet Mohammed in the
7th century.
   ``It is incumbent upon every Moslem to rise up and sacrifice all
he has for the cause of Islam,'' he said.

   Several thousand people
marched to a U.S. naval facility Sunday to call for dismantling of
all Spanish bases leased by the United States.
   Protesters, mobilized by regional pacifist groups and the
Spanish Communist Party, marched nine miles from El Puerto de Santa
Maria to Rota on Spain's southern Atlantic coast.
   They shouted slogans against NATO and demanded an end to the
jointly used naval base at Rota as well as three U.S. air bases and
nine communication centers throughout Spain. When they arrived at
Rota, they formed a three-mile human chain outside the wall of the
base.
   No violence was reported by police, who estimated the crowd at
7,000. Organizers said 12,000 people took part.
   On Jan. 15, the United States agreed to a Spanish demand to
withdraw the U.S. Air Force's 401st Tactical Fighter Wing of 72
F-16 aircraft and an estimated 4,000 troops within three years from
the base at Torrejon. But the United States will keep use of its
other facilities under a new eight-year treaty expected to be
signed this spring.
   The Socialist government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez won a
March 1986 referendum in which Spaniards approved continued
membership in NATO, a military alliance joining Western European
nations to the United States. But the vote said the United States
must reduce its 12,500 troops in Spain.

   The warden of the Federal Detention Center
that was destroyed last November in an uprising by Cuban prisoners
is being promoted to a regional position in California.
   J.R. Johnson became warden in September 1986, about five months
after the center opened and about the time it was changed from a
center for aliens awaiting trial or detention to a holding place
for some of the Cubans who arrived in the ``Freedom Flotilla'' boat
lift but were deemed undesirable.
   He moves to San Francisco on April 24 to become assistant
director of the Bureau of Prisons' western division, overseeing the
nine prisons in the western region.
   Most of the center's buildings were burned in fiery riots that
began Nov. 21, after the 1,000 Cubans there learned that Fidel
Castro had agreed to accept up to 2,500 Cubans who were convicted
of crimes or were mentally ill. Cubans at the federal penitentiary
in Atlanta also rioted.
   The Oakdale inmates held 26 hostages for eight days before
surrendering and being dispersed to prisons around the country.

<TEXT>
   Two men who helped retrieve some of the
estimated $771,000 that accidentally fell from an armored truck
nearly two weeks ago have been given plaques and rewards for their
honesty.
   Luis Lopez, a television repairman, and Daniel Higginbotham, a
postal worker, were also given certificates of recognition from the
Legislature at Friday's ceremony.
   Loomis Armored Inc. gave a check for $10,000 to Higginbotham and
$2,000 to Lopez for their efforts in rescuing some of the money
bags that fell off the truck March 8.
   Three to five people who were driving or walking by when the
truck dropped the loot in an industrial area scooped up plastic
bags full of cash and sped off.
   A spokesman for Loomis declined to reveal how much money was
lost in the incident, but published reports have placed the figure
at about $700,000.
   The opportunistic motorists or pedestrians could face felony
charges of grand theft if they took $500 or more, police said.
However, Lt. Barry Johnson said Friday that police have checked out
quite a few leads but still have not found the culprits.
   Lopez, 29, of Daly City, was on his way home when the incident
occurred. He picked up two bags containing $20,050 each and headed
straight to a nearby Loomis office.
   The following day, a unidentified woman gave police two plastic
bags containing a total of $28,000.
   The money bags fell out of the truck in a crate. Higginbotham
moved the crate out of the street and waited for police to arrive.
Witnesses said he even grabbed bags of money from other people's
hands and put them back in the crate.
   The armored truck, filled with more than $1.7 million collected
from 20 banks in the San Francisco Bay area, was headed for
Oakland-based Loomis' offices from downtown when the incident
occurred.
   The driver, who was not identified, told police that the rear
door was locked but that a dolly holding the crate slammed against
it and forced it open.
   The driver did not realize the crate had fallen out until a
honking motorist pointed it out several blocks away. By that time,
a crowd had gathered around the bags of money.
   About $1 million in cash remained inside the Loomis truck.

   Police said the 6 a.m. blast was apparently caused by a gas leak.
   The explosion killed a mother, her baby and one other woman who

   Four people were slighty injured in the blast, which reduced the
two four-story houses to rubble and damaged houses 300 feet away.
   Police used specially trained dogs to look for more victims.
They said there was little hope of recovering anyone alive from the

   Police said there were indications that workers had repaired the
gas lines in the neighborhood during the week, and police were
investigating whether this was linked to the blast.

<HEAD>Druse Considered Rescue Attempt For Terry Waite, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported Sunday that Druse militia
members in Lebanon considered trying to rescue Anglican Church
envoy Terry Waite from his abductors but dropped the idea because
they thought it lacked U.S. support.
   The Sunday Telegraph said Waite is alive and being held by an
Iranian-backed radical group blamed for other kidnappings in
Lebanon.
   According to the newspaper, Waite was involved in an accident
that required surgery, but it did not give specifics.
   The newspaper said its story was based on an unnamed Lebanese
source who played a key role in investigating Waite's disappearance
in Beirut in January 1987.
   The newspaper said in a dispatch from Washington that Waite, 48,
is being held captive by a Shiite group headed by Imad Mugniyeh, a
member of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella organization for groups
blamed for many of the kidnappings of 22 foreigners held hostage in
Lebanon, including nine Americans. The longest-held hostage is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, who was captured March 16, 1985.
   Waite, special envoy of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie,
disappeared while on a mission to help win the release of hostages.
No group has claimed to be holding him.
   The Sunday Telegraph said for three days after his
disappearance, Waite was kept in a house in the southern suburbs of
Beirut and was in frequent contact with the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon.
   It said Waite was ``not really a hostage'' during this period,
but was driven around the southern suburbs under escort to visit
people in the area.
   The newspaper said Waite was spotted by members of the Druse
militia who had served as his bodyguards. It quoted the source as
saying they found the house in which Waite was staying, tapped the
telephone and monitored his calls to the embassy.
   It quoted the source as saying the Druse considered a military
rescue but ``did not feel they had the full backing of the
Americans for this.''
   ``After three days of semi-captivity the negotiations broke down
and Mr. Waite became a fully-fledged hostage,'' the newspaper said.

   Leftist guerrillas exploded a powerful bomb at
the Peru headquarters of Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company, wounding
two people and starting a fire, police said Sunday.
   The attack, the second in a month against the British-Dutch
firm, came a week after Shell signed a preliminary contract to
develop a rich natural gas deposit in Peru's eastern jungle.
   A carpenter working inside the third-floor office and a woman
selling candy and fruit on the sidewalk suffered serious cuts by
flying glass when the bomb detonated shortly before midnight
Saturday, police said.
   The two were hospitalized and listed in stable condition.
   Shell's main office is about four miles south of downtown Lima.
   Police blamed the attack on the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement, a leftist guerrilla band that endorses a Cuban-styled
Marxism. The group has been carrying out attacks in Lima, mainly
late-night bombings against targets it considers imperialistic,
sice 1984.
   The blast gouged a large hole in the marble floor of Shell's
entryway, shattered windows and lights, demolished furniture and
office equipment and sparked a small fire, which was put out
quickly, police said.
   The explosive also knocked out windows and damaged doors of
three banks and two other businesses in the building, according to
police.

   Marine base spokesman Randy Gaddo said the plane crashed in a
field between a chapel where Sunday morning services were in
progress, and Lejeune Hall, the base headquarters.
   Identities of the victims were being withheld until relatives
could be notified.

   Drugs to relieve some of the
devastating effects of Alzheimer's disease are still years off, but
there is at least a glimmer of hope for victims of the progressive
brain disease, a scientist says.
   Researchers from several nations met in Springfield over the
weekend at the first international symposium on the use of drugs in
treating the disease.
   ``No one would have dared to hold a symposium until now, because
there was no hope before,'' said Dr. Ezio Giacobini, an organizer
of the conference at Southern Illinois University School of
Medicine in Springfield. He is a professor and the chairman of
pharmacology at the school.
   ``The disease was first discovered in 1917, but there was not
even a glimpse of progress until five years ago,'' he said in a
telephone interview Saturday.
   Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible deterioration of the
brain characterized by memory loss, with no known prevention or
cure. An estimated 25 million people in the United States are
afflicted.
   One of the encouraging aspects highlighted at the symposium,
said Giacobini, is that about a dozen drugs which may relieve
symptoms are in various stages of testing around the world.
   ``For the first time we're looking at a number of compounds that
do what has not been done before _ improve memory,'' he said.
   However, most of the drugs under investigation so far produce
only minor modifications for short times.
   One drug that does seem to work is tetrahydroaminoacridine, or
THA, but it has severe side effects, said Dr. Serge Gauthier of the
McGill Center for Studies in Aging, in Montreal.
   It is being tested in the United States and dosage levels have
been reduced to lessen liver damage, reseachers said. Results are
not yet known.
   Experimental use of THA in Canada has shown that while it
improves memory as long as a patient takes it, about 80 percent of
the subjects experience extreme nausea and vomiting, Gauthier said.
   ``If we could find something similar but a little easier on the
liver and stomach, that would be an improvement, but there's
nothing better so far,'' he said.
   Giacobini said Chinese investigators at the symposium told of
identifying two drugs _ huperzine A and huperzine B _ from a plant
called huperzia and testing them on 500 victims of various diseases
with memory-loss symptoms.
   ``They found that the drug increased the memory substantially,''
said Giacobini. ``However the trials have only been done in China
so far. They've never been replicated.''
   The Chinese drugs also have not yet been synthesized and must be
painstakingly extracted from plants.
   Tests of huperzine are planned outside China, in Switzerland and
in Giacobini's laboratory at Southern Illinois.
   Giacobini predicted that within five or 10 years some safe and
effective drug should surface, ``not to cure but to help a lot.''

<HEAD>Parliament Extends Emergency Law for Three Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Sunday approved a three-year
extension of emergency laws passed in 1981 after the assassination
of President Anwar Sadat by Moslem fundamentalists.
   The government said the laws were needed to combat terrorist
threats.
   The Middle East News Agency said the new extension would be in
force from May 1, 1988 to May 31, 1991.
   ``The emergency measures are conducted within the framework of
legality and sovereignity of the constitution and are under
complete judicial supervision, and there is no reason to fear these
measures which enable us to weed out plots,'' MENA quoted a
parliamentary committee's report as saying.
   The emergency laws ban demonstrations, unauthorized assembly and
strikes, and give the government wide powers of search without
warrant and detention of people regarded as security risks.
   They have been in existence since Sadat's slaying on Oct. 6,
1981. They were extended in April 1986 for two years.
   In asking for the extension of the emergency laws, Prime
Minister Atef Sedki told parliament that the laws will be used in
limited incidents and will not affect anyone with ``legitimate
ideologies.''
   Interior Minister Zaki Badr, who is in charge of police and
internal security, told parliament that in the past two years,
authorities had uncovered 227 cases of ``extremist action''
involving 1,458 defendants.
   He said these included cases such as the reconstruction of the
Jihad or holy war group. About 300 Jihad members were tried after
Sadat's assassination and half of them were sentenced to varying
prison terms for forming an illegal organization and attempting to
overthrow the government.
   In addition, 20 members of the Egypt's Revolution group were
charged with carrying out four anti-American and anti-Israeli
terrorist attacks between 1984 and 1987. No date has been set for
the trial.
   Badr said that police had seized large amounts of explosives,
hand grenades, automatic rifles and other weapons with the various
defendants.
   ``It does not take long to see the seriousness of the challenges
and the amounts of dangers that surround us from every side,'' he
said.
   ``I can honostely said that the emergency laws are a necessary
measure that have no alternative. They will secure the society and
protect it from serious dangers,'' Badr said.

   A 35-year-old prison inmate who was barely
literate when he began a life sentence in 1975 for the rape and
stabbing death of a teen-age girl was honored Sunday as one of
seven Outstanding Adult Learners.
   Westville Correctional Center inmate Ernest Tope was selected
for the award by the American Association for Adult and Continuing
Education.
   ``I'm hoping that it will inspire more people in my situation to
devote more time to education and vocational training so they
themselves can achieve personal growth,'' said Tope.
   He was the only prison inmate selected for the award. A
94-year-old California woman and a Nicaraguan immigrant also were
among those honored for overcoming great odds in pursuing their
educations.
   Since his imprisonment, Tope has earned an associate's degree in
general studies from Ball State University and will complete an
associate's degree in business in May from Purdue University's
North Central campus, which operates the college programs at
Westville. He has a grade point average of 5.5 on a 6.0 scale and
plans to earn a bachelor's degree.
   Besides his achievements in education, Tope has earned a
reputation as a jailhouse lawyer. One case he worked on was argued
before the U.S. Supreme Court.
   His publishing credits include an article in The Journal of
Correctional Education and an essay in a college textbook.
   Prison education program director S. Shannon Reffett contends
Tope's greatest achievement is the impact he has on other inmates.
   ``A successful student out of the prison system is a far greater
advocate than any of us,'' said Reffett, who wrote Tope's
recommendation. ``Someone like Ernie, they can comprehend. His life
is kind of a testament to what can be done in prison.''
   Tope said he had a criminal history at age 13, having spent time
at the Indiana Boys School for joy riding and house burglaries. He
said education had never been important to him, and he quit school
at age 15 to work at a gasoline station.
   Tope was convicted of murdering 19-year-old Cheryl Ann Felger,
who was abducted as she rode her bicycle near Van Wert, Ohio, in
April 1974.
   After he was sentenced, he was encouraged by another inmate at
the Indiana State Prison to better himself and later took advantage
of educational programs when he transferred to Westville.
   Tope's award was to be presented during a meeting of the Indiana
Chapter of the Adult and Continuing Education Association, with a
Department of Correction representative accepting it on his behalf.

<HEAD>A Raw Start To Spring In The Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Spring arrived Sunday with a blast of snow and low temperatures
in much of the Northeast, while much of the West had balmy weather.
   ``By the time spring arrived here in Pittsburgh, we had 2 inches
of snow on the ground,'' said Frank Wells, a specialist with the
National Weather Service.
   A cold front pushing across the northern and middle Atlantic
Coast states was accompanied by snow showers scattered from the
upper Ohio Valley through the central Appalachians into southern
and central New England.
   A small civilian airplane trying to fly out of a snowstorm
crashed Sunday on Quantico Marine Base in Virginia, killing all
three people on board, authorities said. Base spokesman Randy Gaddo
said the plane crashed in a field between a chapel where Sunday
morning services were in progress and Lejeune Hall, the base
headquarters.
   A thundershower with sleet and snow rumbled across Nantucket,
Mass., during the morning, accompanied by wind gusting to 52 mph,
and thunder also accompanied snow in New York City.
   Four or more inches of snow fell overnight in northeastern Ohio,
with 8 inches reported at Solon, Ohio. Up to 8.5 inches of snow was
reported at Sinclairville, N.Y., with 3 to 5 inches elsewhere
across western New York state and western Pennsylvania and 7 inches
in northwestern Pennsylvania near Lake Erie.
   Midday temperatures were only in the teens and 20s from central
and eastern North Dakota across the Great Lakes into northern New
England.
   Westerly to northwesterly wind blowing at 15 to 30 mph, with
gusts to near 40 mph, was common from New York state and southern
New England southward to the Carolinas. The wind combined with the
low temperatures to produce subzero wind chill values across
interior sections of New York state.
   Elsewhere, patchy light snow fell from eastern North Dakota into
Upper Michigan, while rain was scattered along the northern Pacific
Coast.
   Temperatures warmed to spring levels in the western half of the
country with readings mostly in the 50s, 60s and 70s, and much of
southern California and southern Arizona got into the 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 13
degrees at Saranac Lake, N.Y., to 89 at Palm Springs, Calif., and
the Miramar Naval Air Station at San Diego. The early-morning low
for the day was 7 below zero at Ironwood and Marquette, Mich.
   For Monday, showers were forecast from the northern half of the
Pacific Coast into western Montana. A little rain or snow was
forecast in Minnesota and northern Wisconsin, with snow flurries in
northern Maine and the lower Great Lakes.
   Highs only in the teens were predicted for northern New England;
in the 20s, 30s and 40s in the rest of the northeastern quarter of
the nation; in the 70s in the central Plains; in the 70s and 80s
from the southern half of California to Florida, Georgia and
Tennessee; near 90 in parts of the desert Southwest and
southwestern Texas; and in the 50s or 60s in most of the rest of
the nation.

<HEAD>Sandinistas And Contras Ready For Cease-Fire Talks</HEAD>

   The Sandinista government on Sunday
protested attacks on Sandinista targets by Honduran forces and
prepared for its first direct cease-fire talks with Contra rebels.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the mediator in previous talks
and an observer to the Monday discussions, expressed a hint of
pessimism about their outcome.
   ``I see the situation as quite complicated,'' he said during his
Sunday homily. ``It is very difficult to reconcile two things that
are completely opposite.''
   The negotiations were scheduled for the southern border post of
Sapoa, 90 miles south of the capital near the Costa Rican border.
   The Honduran bombings Thursday and Saturday along the isolated
northern border were aimed at retaliating for an alleged Sandinista
troop incursion last week into Honduras to chase Contra rebels.
There were no reported casualties in the air attacks.
   ``The Nicaraguan troops are now in Nicaraguan territory in the
border area,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco said at a
news conference Sunday, suggesting that the army had crossed the
border. ``We can't retreat from the border area, because we can't
abandon our right to defend our national territory.''
   He denied reports that the Sandinista troops remained inside
Honduran territory, calling them a lie by the Reagan administration
``to obtain more money for the Contras.''
   The rebels have been fighting the government since Nov. 1981 in
a conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people. The cease-fire
talks are included in a regional peace plan signed in August by the
presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa
Rica. The pact calls for amnesty, democratic reforms and an end to
support for insurgencies.
   Tinoco said Monday's talks will center on finding a way for the
rebels to lay down their arms. The government delegation will be
headed by the nation's top military leader, Gen. Humberto Ortega,
brother of President Daniel Ortega.
   The Contras say the talks should include political issues. Their
top delegate will be the rebels' leading political leader, Adolfo
Calero.
   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada repeated its call Sunday for
Nicaraguans to maintain a state of alert in the face of Honduran
bombs and American troops.
   ``The way the Honduran government borrows Yankee planes to
provoke an incident could serve as a pretext for a direct
invasion,'' the paper said in an editorial.

<HEAD>Poll: Bush Leads In Wisconsin; Dukakis, Jackson Top Democrats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush held a strong
lead among Republican voters here, while Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson were ahead of other Democrats in the
Wisconsin presidential primary race, according to a newspaper's
public opinion poll published SUnday.
   The Milwaukee Journal said it questioned 782 Wisconsin resdents
who said they were fairly certain to vote in the April 5 primary.
The poll, conducted Wednesday and Thursday, asked the respondents
which candidate they would choose in the open primary, which does
not require voters to state party preference.
   Among Democrats, 38 percent chose Dukakis and 30 percent
supported Jackson. Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 11 percent;
Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois also had 11 percent and Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. had 10 percent. The margin of error was 5
percentage points, the survey said.
   Among Republicans, 69 percent supported Bush; 25 percent backed
Sen. Bob Dole and 6 percent chose Pat Robertson. The margin of
error on the Republican was 6 percentage points, the newspaper
reported.

   With the New York presidential primary less
than a month away, Gov. Mario Cuomo indicated Sunday that he has
plans for a more active advisory role in the Democratic
presidential campaign.
   Cuomo said he had asked his most trusted political adviser, son
Andrew Cuomo, to begin consulting with all the Democratic
presidential candidates.
   ``Up until a week ago, he was getting calls from everybody, but
he told them all that he wasn't involved,'' said the governor. ``I
have asked him in the last week or so to start taking calls from
the candidates and help us by letting us know what he thinks of
their campaigns in New York.''
   The New York primary is April 19.
   Cuomo's comments came on the eve of a meeting with Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. But Cuomo said he would give Gore the same
message he has given to all the other candidates _ that he he's not
endorsing anyone yet.
   Meanwhile, Sunday's New York Daily News reported that Andrew
Cuomo might be on the verge of joining the Gore camp.
   ``Andrew is not leaning toward anybody,'' said his father when
asked about that.

<HEAD>Vice President To Appear With Kean</HEAD>

   Gov. Thomas Kean scheduled a meeting Monday
with Vice President George Bush for the Republican presidential
nomination, prompting speculation that an endorsement could be in
the offing.
   The meeting was arranged at the request of Bush's campaign, said
Carl Golden, a spokesman for Kean. Golden would not comment on
whether Kean would endorse Bush.
   Joseph ``Bo'' Sullivan, the chairman of a New Jersey
fund-raising group backing Bush, said it was unlikely Bush would
meet with Kean in the heat of the primary campaign unless the
governor was prepared to back his presidential campaign.
   ``The time is ripe for everyone to make an endorsement. I don't
see how anyone can beat Bush at this point,'' Sullivan said.
   Kean has remained uncommitted to any of the candidates in the

<HEAD>Arkansas Governor Urges Smaller Regional Primaries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of Gov. Bill Clinton's enthusiasm
for the Super Tuesday 20-state contest held on March 8 has
apparently abated.
   Instead of such a large-scale Super Tuesday, Clinton suggested
smaller seven- or eight-state primary elections, separated by
enough time ``for candidates to really go into the states and get
to know the people and the issues.''
   A lot of the campaigning leading up to the March 8 voting, the
governor said in his weekly radio address on Saturday, consisted of
airport news conferences and television advertising. Thus, Clinton
said, well-funded candidates benefited unfairly.
   The governor said he had hoped Super Tuesday would give Southern
voters ``a more personal identification with the candidates.''
   He said, though, that Super Tuesday accomplished some goals that
had been his reasons for supporting the massive regional effort,
including bringing candidates to the South and giving the region
more influence in the nominating process.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Jackson Maintain Super Tuesday Strength In Texas
Conventions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson has solidified his presidential bid
in Texas and should have about as many delegates as Michael Dukakis
when Democrats hold their state convention this spring in Houston,
the Texas Democratic Party chairman said Sunday.
   Although Dukakis earned more delegates in Super Tuesday's
primary voting in Texas, Jackson appeared to have gathered more
at-large delegates in Saturday's 270 county and senatorial district
conventions across the state.
   Those conventions determine the allocation of 64 at-large
delegates to the national convention, but statewide results of
Saturday's meetings were not tallied.
   With just over half of the 5,288 delegates accounted for,
Jackson had 41 percent and Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts, 36
percent. Uncommitted delegates were running 10 percent; Tennessee
Sen. Al Gore had 10 percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, 3
percent, and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, 1 percent. Former Colorado
Sen. Gary Hart had one delegate, from a district in Houston.
   ``I would just guess the state convention will be composed of
one-third Jackson, one-third Dukakis and about a third of the
people either Gore, Gephardt or uncommitted,'' said state
Democratic Party Chairman Bob Slagle.
   State Democrats meet for their convention June 9-11 in Houston,
where they will chose delegates to the national convention.
   On Saturday, Republicans met in senatorial district and county
conventions. Many counties reported a record GOP turnout at the
meetings.
   Although Vice President George Bush won all 111 national
delegates to the convention, the GOP battles were over delegates
who will eventually write the party's platform and rules.
   A Pat Robertson-controlled convention in Nueces County adjourned
when their alloted time ran out and reconvened in a church a short
time later. Backers of Bush tried to block the move to the church,
but were voted down.
   ``That place was full of religious fanatics,'' said Nueces
County Bush delegate Steve Cobb. ``They voted down everyone who
voted against reconvening in a church out of concern for separation
of church and state.''
   Among the Democrats, supporters of Dukakis and Jackson wrestled
in several areas. Dukakis finished first in the March 8 primary,
with Jackson finishing second.
   In the 9th senatorial district of Dallas, Jackson carried the
day by winning 153 delegates to only two for Dukakis, while 104
remained uncommitted. Jackson also scored an upset in Travis
County, which Dukakis won in the primary. Jackson took 138
delegates to Dukakis' 99.
   Texas Democrats use a peculiar two-track system of picking
delegates, with 119 chosen by state senatorial districts through
the primary vote and the remaining 64 allocated statewide through a
separate process of caucuses and conventions. Overall, Texas
Democrats were selecting 5,288 delegates for their June state
convention, where the 64 at-large delegates to the national
convention actually will be chosen.
   Delegates to the state convention were picked from 63,380 people
selected at precinct conventions held when the polls closed on
Super Tuesday. Saturday's conventions were held in each county, and
in state senatorial districts in counties that have more than one
state senator. The proportion for awarding of the 64 delegates was
set at the more than 6,000 precinct conventions on March 8.

<HEAD>20 States to Get U.S. Grants to Improve Crime Reporting Systems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bureau of Justice Statistics will award
grants totaling about $5 million to 20 states and the District of
Columbia to assist them in improving their crime reporting systems,
the bureau said Sunday.
   The federal aid, ranging from $18,000 for Delaware to $373,000
for Virginia, will enable the states and district to upgrade their
crime information systems and make the information they submit to
the FBI more accurate, the bureau said.
   Under the new system, state and local law enforcement agencies
will forward individual records to the FBI monthly for selected
crimes and arrests rather than submitting monthly summary
statistics, as they currently do.
   The bureau, which is part of the Justice Department, said the
new system will enable police departments to describe the crimes in
their area more accurately and could help them reduce the number of
offenses.
   The new information that will be forwarded to the FBI will
include the time and location of the crime, the victim-offender
relationship, the presence or absence of a weapon and the number
and types of offenses that occurred during each criminal incident.
   Police departments and others reporting crimes will
cross-reference arrests to the crimes that have been committed and
distinguish between completed and attempted crimes. The definition
of rape also will be broadened to include all forcible sexual
offenses.
   Alabama, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New York, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Virginia and the District of
Columbia have received their grants.
   Four other states will be announced at a later date, the bureau
said.
   The bureau announced the amount of the grants for only Delaware
and Virginia.
   Twenty-six states applied for the grants, although the bureau
invited all 50 states to compete.

<HEAD>Latin American Growth Drops Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production faltered in Latin America last year
after three years of growth, the InterAmerican Development Bank
reported Sunday.
   In the years 1984 to 1986, the official value of all production
in Latin America grew by an average of 3.8 percent a year, the bank
said in its annual report. In 1987, the growth was only 2 percent.
Since population also grew at about that rate, the average income
remained stagnant for the area as a whole.
   There was a wide range within the average.
   Brazil is the biggest and most populous country and accounts for
about a third of the area's total production. In 1986, its growth
was more than 8 percent, and so was Peru's. Two of Brazil's
neighbors _ Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago _ saw declines in their
production of more than 6 percent that year.
   The report does not furnish figures for individual countries in
1987, but says that none of the big four _ Argentina, Brazil,
Mexico and Venezuela _ had a growth rate of more than 4 percent.
   However, about one-third of the 25 countries did achieve a
growth rate of more than 4 percent, with the Dominican Republic and
Peru recording the largest increase, the bank said. The others in
that group were Chile, Colombia, Honduras, Jamaica, Paraguay and
Uruguay.
   Meanwhile, incomes of people in about half the countries dropped
again in 1987, the bank said, but did not provide any figure for
that year. It put average income in 1986 at $2.145. The World Bank
estimated the U.S. average at $16,400 in 1985.
   Lack of jobs and social security protection for the unemployed
led to a big increase in Latin America of what the report calls the
``informal sector,'' which refers to a huge portion of the economy
never reported in the official statistics, ranging from
bootblacking to heroin production.
   For example, the International Monetary Fund reported Colombia's
exports at $2.87 billion in 1986. According to estimates quoted by
the Manchester Guardian Weekly, Colombia's Medellin drug cartel
grosses at least $7 billion a year.
   The report says that in 1986, only 10 out of 25 countries
increased their production faster than the labor force and that
preliminary figures showed a similar picture for 1987.
   ``This is a disquieting development,'' it adds.
   It explains that investment in new factories and equipment _
that is, the capacity to produce more goods _ must grow faster than
the number of working people if more jobs are to be created.
Otherwise, the prospect is poor for reducing unemployment.
   ``With few exceptions, the high levels of unemployment and
underemployment which have prevailed ... in the 1980s show no signs
of diminishing,'' it says.
   It notes that over the past 20 or 30 years there has been:
   _A massive shift of people to cities, out of farming and into
industry and services;

   Money flowed out of Latin America for the fifth year in a row,
reversing the historic trend: new investment usually brings a net
inflow of cash to poor countries from richer ones. Much of the
outflow was in the form of interest payments and repayments on
Latin America's debt of more than $400 billion.
   The bank itself, owned by 44 govermnments, disbursed $1.919
billion in new loans to raise living standards in 1987, and got
back $2.116 billion in repayments and interest. It authorized
$2.361 billion in additional loans, down from $3.037 billion in
1986.
   Efforts to increase its lending were stalled by refusal of
borrowing governments to accept a change in the voting system on
new loans. Now, borrowers control the lending. The United States
proposed shifting percentages needed to approve a loan so that it
would have a veto over new loans whenever it could get Canada to go
along with it.

<HEAD>Chrysler Tries Not To Raise Hopes Of Kenosha Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. officials who met with
business leaders to discuss the city's future after the automaker
closes its plant here say they're being careful not to build false
expectations.
   Chrysler Vice President Robert Perkins said Saturday that
company chairman Lee A. Iacocca cautioned him against making any
promises about continued employment after the September shutdown.
   Iacocca was censured earlier this year by state and union
officials who accused Chrysler of breaking a 1987 pledge to
continue Kenosha production for at least three years. Chrysler
denies making any written commitment.
   Perkins led a delegation of 15 Chrysler executives who met with
state, city and county officials to discuss the company's plans to
halt auto production in September, putting about 5,500 people out
of work.
   Perkins said Iacocca told the company delegation before the
meeting: ``Don't repeat the mistake that Chrysler management made,
building up an expectation that we can't deliver.''
   But the company ``is making a sincere effort'' to see if
business can be sustained at the factory, Perkins said.
   Perkins also cautioned that government contracts sent to Kenosha
might not arrive soon enough to avoid the fall layoffs. It would
take time to gear the factory to a new product line, he explained.
   ``In the defense business, there are long lead times. In the
auto business, there are long lead times,'' Perkins said.
   While pay for workers on the auto assembly line averages $27 an
hour including benefits, the Department of Defense contracts held
by Chrysler pay $15 an hour or less, said Rep. Les Aspin, who
arranged Saturday's meeting.
   Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, was asked
if he would use his influence in Washington to get military work
for Kenosha.
   ``Everyone who is in Wisconsin doing defense work gets tender
loving care from this congressman,'' he said.
   After Saturday's meeting, an Aspin aide said the congressman
wanted another meeting with Chrysler scheduled in the next month.
Perkins said, however, that no meeting had been scheduled yet,
although follow-ups with individual companies would take place.

<HEAD>Christian Democrats keep control of Baden-Wuerttemberg in state
elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STUTTGART, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union won a major election test Sunday,
retaining power in Baden-Wuerttemberg state but with a smaller
margin.
   West Germany's three other major parties also suffered
percentage losses in the state balloting. Two small right-wing
parties scored surprising gains, apparently getting votes from
dissatisfied farmers.
   Three hours after the polls closed at 6 p.m., computer
projections by the national television networks gave the Christian
Democrats about 49 percent of the vote.
   They dropped under the 50-percent mark for the first time in 16
years, but the party will maintain its absolute control of the
state legislature.
   Its main opposition, the Social Democrats, had 32 percent, down
from 32.4 percent in 1984.
   The environmentalist Greens received 7.9 percent, just under the
8 percent four years ago, while the Free Democrats who had hoped to
force the CDU into a coalition suffered a blow, getting 6 percent
compared to 7.2 percent in 1984.
   Two far-right parties acted as spoilers, but neither won enough
votes to gain any seats in the legislature. the National Democratic
Party of Germany had about 2 percent and the Republicans 1 percent.
   Several smaller parties shared the remaining vote.
   According to Baden-Wuerttemberg's complicated election laws, the
number of seats in the state parliament can vary, and the new
legislature was expected to have 125 seats, one less than the
previous one.
   Led by Lothar Spaeth, the governor for 10 years, the Christian
Democrats were expected to win at least 66 seats, compared to 68 in
the previous legislature.
   Social Democrats had 42, a gain of one, and the Greens also
gained one for a total of 10.
   The Free Democrats lost a seat and will have seven.
   Spaeth, 50, campaigned on Baden-Wuerttemberg's strong economic
performance, and Kohl said the results were a ``great personal
victory'' for the governor.
   At 5 percent, the state has the lowest unemployment rate in the
country, about four points under the national average.
   Spaeth has transformed the southwestern state from a
predominantly rural area into a major base for the growing
electronics and high-technology industries.
   The result was a welcome relief for Kohl's party, which had been
slipping since the national election in January 1987.
   The Christian Democrats lost their majority in Kohl's home state
of Rhineland-Palatinate last May, and were forced into a coalition
with the Free Democrats. The Christian Democrats and Free Democrats
also are governing coalition partners in the federal government and
in six of West Germany's 11 states.
   Kohl, speaking on national television, said the two small
right-wing parties apparently picked up votes from farmers who are
unhappy with Spaeth's policies and want more aid.
   ``I don't see a radical trend,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor says police officers
misinterpreted an order to ``go on in'' when they broke down the
front door of a house, drawing gunfire from an 84-year-old occupant
who was then shot and killed by an officer.
   Police converged on the home of Dillard Free last Christmas Eve
after getting a tip that a rape suspect was hiding there.
   A grand jury on March 10 declined to indict the officer who shot
Free. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation report on the incident
remains sealed because of indictments against two people who
directed police to the house and are accused of making false
statements.
   But in an interview published Sunday in The Times of
Gainesville, District Attorney Andy Fuller said he had decided to
discuss the GBI's findings because ``the people of Hall County need
to know this information.''
   Fuller said the GBI found that six law officers who planned the
approach on the Free home remembered that Detective Robert Gable
directed them to use the normal procedure for serving an arrest
warrant, that is, knock and announce: ``Warrant.''
   But officers Lee West, Gary Lenderman and Kirk Williamson, who
took up positions in front of the house, were not in the group
given that instruction, Fuller said.
   Fuller gave this account of the subsequent walkie-talkie
conversation: Detective Russell Elrod told the officers: ``Go on
in.'' Lendermen seemed surprised and asked: ``You want us to go?''
Elrod answered: ``10-4,'' police parlance for ``yes.''
   Elrod meant for the officers to knock on the door, but the
officers thought they were being told to enter the house, Fuller
said.
   West then knocked down the front door and he and Williamson
entered the darkened living room while Sgt. Benny Patrick rushed
onto the front porch, the district attorney said.
   Fuller said Patrick saw a silhouette moving inside and shouted
``Police,'' but a shot was fired that narrowly missed his head. He
said West, inside the living room, also shouted ``Police'' and the
figure fired again, this time striking a door frame.
   West then fired two shots, fatally wounding Free.
   Free's wife, Agnes, 73, was hospitalized suffering from shock.
She died March 5, three days after suffering a heart attack.
   The grand jury expressed outrage about the shooting despite its
decision not to indict West, and called for a review of police
procedures.
   The Free family has hired a lawyer who said a lawsuit is likely.
   The rape suspect the officers were seeking was arrested on
Christmas Day in Texas.

<HEAD>Back From Calcutta, Brown Talks of Death and Politics</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release after 6 p.m. EST</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After three weeks tending to the dead and dying
in India, former California Gov. Jerry Brown says he has returned
home with his mind on politics.
   ``After all,'' Brown writes in the April issue of Life magazine,
``that's what I spent a good part of my life doing.'' And while he
never explicitly says so, he hints that he'll be returning to
politics.
   After a six-year odyssey that took him to several continents and
included an extended stay at a Zen Buddhist retreat in Japan, the
48-year-old Brown volunteered for duty earlier this year at Mother
Teresa's clinic for the terminally ill in Calcutta.
   He said his routine included bathing and hand-feeding men
suffering from tuberculosis and malnutrition, changing and washing
blankets and receptacles for phlegm, and holding the hands of the
dying.
   ``To work with the dying and destitute _ getting a person a
glass of water, helping with a bedpan _ is to encounter life at a
very basic level,'' he wrote. ``People can be surprisingly happy
and grateful when you help them with even the smallest things. ...
   ``In Calcutta I never escaped human suffering,'' he added. ``The
most distressing thought of all was that much of this would be
preventable or curable if nations could be mobilized to combat
human suffering rather than to engage in national rivalries.''
   Brown, who sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976
and 1980, said he returned to the United States on the day of the
Iowa caucuses and watched the coverage on television.
   ``As I watched, I wondered: `How could I ever take the spirit of
Mother Teresa and apply it to the ordinary world of business and
politics?'''
   Noting the emphasis this year on the personal character and
private lives of politicians, he said: ``People are not just
looking for a program or a list of ideas. They want virtue. They
want a leader they can trust.''

   A federal study has found no
suggestion that drinking alcohol increases a woman's chance of
breast cancer, a result that clashes with recent research.
   ``Conclusive statements or general recommendations concering the
relationship between alcohol consumption and breast cancer seem
premature,'' said Susan Chu of the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.
   Perhaps some alcohol-related factors, rather than alcohol
itself, account for the effect shown by other test subjects, she
said. ``We have difficulty explaining why our study differs from
those other studies,'' she said.
   Nobody has shown any biological reason why alcohol would raise a
woman's breast cancer risk, she said.
   At a meeting of science writers sponsored by the American Cancer
Society, Chu described results of a study of 3,252 women between
the ages of 20 and 54 with newly diagnosed breast cancer and 2,971
other women chosen for comparison.
   All the women were interviewed in their homes and asked about
their alcohol-drinking habits in the previous five years. If they
drank, they were asked to estimate how many days a week they drank
and how much they consumed on each day.
   When data from the two groups were compared, Chu said, ``we
found no relationship between drinking in the past five years and
breast cancer risk.''
   Two studies released in May that did find an increase in risk
gained a lot of attention, she said.
   The studies, directed by scientists at the Harvard School of
Public Health and the National Cancer Institute, cited an apparent
increase in risk with as few as three drinks a week.
   But the principal authors of both studies said the data were not
strong enough to recommend changes in drinking habits for American
women.
   The cancer society has no formal recommendation on alcohol and
breast cancer.
   Lawrence Garfinkel, the society's vice president for
epidemiology, said Sunday that several studies had shown no added
breast cancer risk from moderate drinking.
   ``The jury's still out,'' he said. If there is a risk, he said,
``it has to be very, very minimal.''
   Future studies should focus on the age that alcohol consumption
began and how long it has lasted, Chu said.
   In another paper presented at the science writers' conference, a
researcher cited research data challenging the link others have
found between dietary fat and cancer.
   Calories are the dietary villain rather than fat, said David
Klurfeld of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, who studied rats
that were chemically treated to encourage tumor growth.
   The contention has been debated for some time among scientists,
whose findings have been mixed.
   Klurfeld said his studies showed the direct link to cancer risk
appeared to be body mass, because the rats that exercised enough to
work off calories had a lower cancer risk than animals that were
sedentary.
   The cancer society says dietary fat may play a role in breast,
colon and prostate cancers. It also says obese people run a higher
risk of colon, breast and uterine cancers. Klurfeld said he agreed
with the second statement but not the first.
   He said his research was funded by the National Institutes of
Health, the American Institute for Cancer Research and several food
companies that he did not name. The source of the funding did not
affect results, he said.
   The cancer society's Garfinkel said the fat-vs.-calories issue
is an open question.
   ``I don't know how soon we can get it resolved'' because of the
difficulty of studying it in human populations, he said.

   Iran claimed on Sunday that Iraq killed
5,000 Iraqi Kurds in poison gas attacks while trying to blunt an
Iranian offensive. It also said Iran blasted Iraq's two largest
cities with 13 missiles.
   Iraq reported its gunners fired a long-range missile into
Tehran, the Iranian capital, late Sunday. A military spokesman was
quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency as saying such attacks
would continue ``until the Tehran rulers accept international calls
for peace.''
   There was no response from the Iraqi government in Baghdad on
the Iranian allegations about chemical weapons.
   But the Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the army's
2nd Corps repulsed an overnight Iranian assault in the central
sector of the front, killing or wounding 1,200 soldiers.
   Iran said it fired 13 missiles into the Iraqi capital, Baghdad,
and the southern port city of Basra on Sunday in the continuing
duel known as the ``war of the cities.'' It reported ``heavy
casualties'' in its shelling of Iraqi border cities.
   In the Persian Gulf, shipping sources said Iranian gunboats
attacked the 84,631-ton Liberian-flag tanker Atlantic Peace with
rocket-propelled grenades. No casualties were reported.
   It was the fourth Iranian assault on neutral shipping in the
past three days in the long tug-of-war for control of the Persian
Gulf. Iraqis made an air strike on Iran's Kharg Island oil terminal
Saturday, leaving two tankers in flames.
   The Iranians claimed they captured the Kurdish towns of Halabja,
Kholmar and Dojaila in Sulaimaniyeh province on Thursday in the
week-old offensive in the northeastern mountains of Iraq.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said the Iraqis used cyanide, mustard and other
unidentified nerve gases in the attacks ``to prevent the people
from joining Iranian combatants.'' Many Kurds, a semi-nomadic Sunni
Moslem people, have been fighting the Baghdad government for years.
   The agency quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati as
telling U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that 5,000
Kurdish civilians were among the dead.
   The Iranian official reportedly criticized the United Nations
for failing to halt Iraq's alleged use of chemical weapons. Iran
has warned it will begin using the same weapons in the 7{-year-old
Gulf war if Iraq persists.
   The Iraqi attack, if true, would be the struggle's worst with
chemical weapons, outlawed under a 1925 agreement in Geneva,
Switzerland. Iraq denies it uses the weapons.
   The Iranians said nearly 1,000 of the Kurdish casualties had
been airlifted to Iranian hospitals for treatment. They appealed to
the International Red Cross and other humanitarian agencies for
medical aid.
   In the continuing exchange of missiles, the Iranian news agency
reported that, as Iran celebrated the Persian new year, its forces
fired two long-range missiles into Baghdad and 11 short-range
rockets into the battered southern port city of Basra.
   Both sides have fired more than 200 missiles into each other's
main cities and border towns since Feb.29.
   The Iranian news agency reported that at least six civilians
were killed in Iraqi missile attacks on Tehran Saturday night and
in air raids on several of its western cities.

   A man who allegedly told police he killed
his brother and three other people after they played a stereo too
loud faces a indictment as early as next month, authorities said
Sunday.
   Earl Losier Jr., 32, of Bangor was being held without bail in
the Penobscot County Jail after being charged with murder Saturday
and undergoing psychological testing at the Augusta Mental Health
Institute.
   ``Right now, he's charged with one count of murder, but I'm sure
he'll be indicted on four counts of murder,'' said Richard W. Hall,
the suspect's court-appointed attorney. Hall said he expected the
indictments to come in April or May.
   Losier was arrested early Saturday at his parents' house,
downstairs from the apartment where the shootings occurred. He
entered no plea during an appearance in District Court.
   Autopsies revealed the victims ``all died of gunshot wounds. At
least a couple died of multiple gunshot wounds,'' said Fernand
LaRochelle, chief of the Maine attorney general's criminal division.
   Losier said he shot the four ``because he was taking cough syrup
and because they were playing the stereo too loud,'' Bangor police
Detective Roy E. McKinney said in an affidavit filed in court that
quoted a policeman sent to investigate the report of a shooting.
   Police testified in court that a .45-caliber semi-automatic
handgun was seized at the scene of the shooting, a dilapidated
building containing several apartments about a block from the
police station.
   Bangor police Lt. Don O'Halloran left word with a dispatcher
Sunday that no information about the investigation would be
immediately forthcoming. Police investigators continued to work at
the scene.
   O'Halloran said Saturday that he believed Losier is an
unemployed laborer.
   Police identified the victims as Peter Prendergast, 26, of
Brewer; his brother, Michael Prendergast, 31, of Bangor; and
sister, Sharon Prendergast, 23, of Bangor; and Stephen Losier, 26,
of Bangor. Ms. Prendergast, described as Stephen Losier's
girlfriend, was pregnant at the time of her death, officials said.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Gets Warm Reception From California Democrats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HOWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, in an emotional,
revival-style speech Sunday punctuated by listeners' shrieks, told
California Democrats that ``there's room for you in the Jackson
campaign.''
   The Democratic presidential contender addressed some 1,200
delegates and guests at the state Democrats' annual convention in
affluent Palm Springs. He was the only Democratic candidate to
accept the state party's invitation to speak.
   Jackson, arriving in the midst of a fractious party battle over
primary election endorsements, called on Democrats to unite and
``have hope when the Jackson campaign comes to town.''
   There was little that was new in Jackson's 40-minute address,
but delegates repeatedly stomped, cheered and applauded the
candidate as Jackson called for peace in the Middle East, more jobs
for American workers and help for farmers.
   Jackson got his loudest response for denouncing the Reagan
administration's decision to send combat troops to Honduras.
   ``We're sending troops to Latin America, when we should be
sending negotiators to Latin America. Our reasoning has collapsed
in Latin America,'' he said.
   The administration policy, he said, reflects ``desperation, a
state of panic. We put military first, economics second. We're
militarily strong, and diplomatically weak. We have guided missles
and misguided leadership,'' he said.
   Jackson called his presidential bid a no-frills effort.
   ``We're short on money, long on message and clear on mission,''
he said, ``If I can win against the odds I face, every American can
win.''
   He touted the fact that he leads in popular votes garnered in
contests to date. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis leads in the
delegate count, however.
   California's primary is June 7, and the state sends 336
delegates to the Democratic National Convention this summer in
Atlanta _ the largest state delegation.
   Jackson said he has been successful at fund-raising, but he
refused when asked afterward to detail how much money he has raised
in California.
   ``We're doing incredibly well, and I can say that we will have
every dollar we need to wage an effective campaign, a competitive
campaign in California,'' said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown,
Jackson's national campaign chairman.
   Brown has said Jackson must raise and spend at least $1 million
in California to win the state primary.
   Peter Kelly, the state Democratic Party chairman, said Jackson's
decision to appear at the convention ``definitely gives him a jump
in California.''

   Two British soldiers killed in
a brutal attack by an angry mob had ignored orders to stay away
from an Irish Republican Army funeral procession, the British army
said Sunday.
   Officials reported police fired plastic bullets Sunday at youths
who hijacked a bus in Roman Catholic west Belfast. The shots were
fired when the youths tried to attack a riot squad, police said.
   No injuries were reported.
   All soldiers in the British province had been told to stay away
from Saturday's funeral, an army spokesman said. He said an army
investigation is under way.
   ``The two corporals should not have been where they were and we
are interested in examining how that came about,'' said the
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``They would have been briefed about the route of the funeral
procession, and the two corporals were not expected to be there and
had no requirement to be there.''
   Corporals Derek Wood, 24, and David Howes, 23, who were wearing
civilian clothes, were shot to death in Belfast after people in the
funeral procession dragged from their unmarked car, beat them
unconscious and stripped them naked.
   The outlawed IRA claimed responsibility for the deaths and the
Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force, said it
was questioning three people. Police said they were studying
videotapes of the attack.
   Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, blamed the British
government for the violence and praised those who beat the soldiers
for their ``bravery in protecting the cortege from attack.''
   There was a bomb scare Sunday morning at a Catholic church near
the site where the soldiers were slain.
   Although it was a hoax, the minister of St. Agnes church, the
Rev. Thomas Toner, said at Mass that ``the foul and bloody murders
... committed in our parish'' had put his congregation ``in the
direct firing line'' of vengeance-seeking Protestants.
   ``The thought of these two soldiers being savagely beaten and
then shot in cold blood will give rise to feelings of revulsion in
every Irish man or woman who has a spark of human feeling,'' said
Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, head of the Catholic church in Ireland.
   Both soldiers belonged to the Royal Corps of Signals, a regiment
often engaged in secret monitoring of communications. Wood joined
the army in April 1980 and Howes in August 1981.
   The army spokesman said the two had been traveling in civilian
clothes between the Belfast Battalion's headquarters and near Falls
Road and the British army's Northern Ireland headquarters.
   ``There are a number of possible routes available to them, but
it is a matter of speculation how they came to be in a place they
were not supposed to be in,'' he said.
   ``Their restraint under the most hideous provocation was obvious
to the entire nation,'' the statement said.
   The soldiers were killed when they encountered the procession
following the coffin of Kevin Brady, an IRA member and one of three
people killed last Wednesday at Milltown Catholic cemetery.
   In that attack, a gunman alleged to be a Protestant extremist
opened fire and hurled grenades at mourners during the burial of
three IRA guerrillas shot by British commandos in Gibraltar on
March 6. Another 68 people were injured in the funeral attack.
   Witnesses to the attack Saturday said the soldiers' car was
engulfed by angry mourners who apparently assumed they were
undercover agents spying on the crowd.
   The army said the soldiers' weapons apparently were taken from
them and used against them.
   Witnesses said the soldiers were thrown into a taxi and driven
to a nearby vacant lot where shots were heard and where their
naked, bullet-riddled and battered bodies were found a short while
later.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Irish Premier
Charles Haughey condemned the violence.
   More than 2,630 people have died in 19 years of sectarian strife
in Northern Ireland, where the IRA is fighting to drive the British
out. The mainly Roman Catholic guerrilla group wants to unite the
predominantly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Catholic
Irish Republic.
   Gillian Johnston, a 21-year-old Protestant killed by IRA
guerrillas, was buried in County Fermanagh Sunday. The IRA said she
was killed by mistake Friday night and that the shots were aimed at
her brother who it claimed works for the security forces. The
family denied that.

   Children found playing with the lid to a
radioactive device missing from the trunk of a stolen car were not
exposed to radioactive elements in the gadget, officials said
Sunday.
   However, because the lid had been removed from the device,
officials said, there was a greater possibility for release of
radioactivity.
   As of Sunday, authorities were stymied in their search for the
device, which measures the density of moisture in soil and contains
the radioactive elements cesium 137 and americium 241, said Larry
Krieger, a spokesman for the Newark Fire Department.
   Both substances are considered extremely dangerous.
   A much larger amount of cesium 137 killed four people and
injured 121 in Goiania, Brazil, last year when a lead canister from
a medical device was broken open at a junkyard and the glowing
powder wase passed around.
   But the amount of cesium in the missing device was only a
fraction of the 17 grams of the substance involved in the Brazil
disaster, officials said.
   The device contains only 0.1 milligram of cesium and about 15
milligrams of americium, said Karl Abraham, a spokesman for the
Philadelphia office of the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A
milligram is one one-thousandth of a gram, so the amount of cesium
involved in Brazil was 170,000 times as much as is contained in the
missing New Jersey device.
   The gauge's lid was recovered Saturday after police received an
anonymous tip that the device was in a vacant lot where stolen cars
are routinely abandoned, Krieger said.
   Authorities didn't find the device there, but they did find
about four or five youngsters playing with the lid, he said.
   The children gave conflicting stories about how they got the
lid, Krieger said. They tested negative for exposure to
radioactivity, he said.
   The gauge can be carried safely, but the NRC warned that ``any
attempt to extract the gauge from the case could result in serious
radiation exposure to anyone tampering with it.''
   On Thursday, authorities arrested four youths on charges of
possessing the auto, stolen March 10 while its owner, a soil
engineer, attended classes at the New Jersey Institute of
Technology.
   The bright yellow plastic box containing the device and labeled
``Radioactive'' was missing from the trunk of the car when Essex
County police recovered the vehicle Tuesday in the Christopher
Columbus Housing Project.

<HEAD>Performance Artist and 360 Eggs Welcome Spring 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three hundred and sixty eggs did a delicate
balancing act early Sunday morning in a symbolic ritual attended by
about 200 celebrators welcoming spring.
   ``Considering the hour, more people showed up than I expected,''
said Donna Henes, the performance artist who helped organize the
event.
   The egg balancing took place on a long table-like platform set
up at the South Street Seaport in lower Manhattan at 4:39 a.m., the
precise moment of the vernal equinox, one of two points in the year
when the sun crosses the equator and day and night are equal.
   According to Henes, balancing an egg on its end is an ancient
Chinese custom that brings good luck to the successful balancer.
   Scientists are dubious whether eggs really do balance during the
equinox because of changes in the gravitational pull, but Henes is
convinced.
   ``Its funny, because I've asked a lot of scientists about it and
they say its impossible,'' Henes said. ``However, when I ask them
to join in the ritual and they see it happen, they become instant
believers.''
   Henes, who has been observing the egg-balancing ritual for the
past 13 years, said eggs are ancient symbols of fertility and
spring around the world. ``Easter is only one of many spring
holidays where the egg is used as a symbol of rebirth,'' she said.
   Participants began arriving at about 3:45 a.m., and after
balancing their eggs they enjoyed them at a breakfast prepared by a
chef from one of the seaport tourist attraction's restaurants,
according to Betsy Jordan Hand, a spokeswoman for the seaport.

<HEAD>Former Carter Aide Calls On American Jews To Take A Greater Stake
In Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   American Jews must take a more active role
in Israeli affairs if they hope to affect the country's policies in
the occupied territories, a former aide to President Jimmy Carter
told the American Jewish Congress on Sunday.
   The congress, which will consider resolutions calling for Israel
to withdraw from the riot-torn West Bank and Gaza Strip, opened its
biennial convention Sunday with a keynote address by Stuart E.
Eizenstat, former adviser to Carter for domestic policy.
   ``If we are only sideline kibitzers who throw darts at Israeli
policy from long range and then retreat to our comfortable everyday
pursuits, we will not deserve to participate in the political
discussions in Israel,'' Eizenstat said.
   Eizenstat told about 200 conventioneers that American Jews must
end the ``passive, check-writing mentality'' and become much more
involved in the political, religious and economic spheres of
Israeli life.
   ``It is also our future they are debating,'' he said.
   He urged his fellow American Jews to make investments in Israel
and to spend time in Israel to understand the country's
perspective. However, he said, they should keep their comments
balanced to avoid the ``volatile domestic political cauldron.''
   The American Jewish community ``should be full participants in
the broad debate about the direction Israel takes on political
questions, such as the future of the territories, but it should
carry on this debate, to the extent possible, in Israel rather than
the United States,'' he said.
   The discussions that do occur in the United States should take
place in private, he said.
   Public criticism will be used by Israel's enemies to ``drive a
wedge between American Jewry and Israel,'' he said.
   The convention, which will attract 400 to 500 delegates, also
will consider the peace plan proposed by Secretary of State George
P. Shultz in the face of Arab rioting in the territories.
   Shultz's plan envisions that talks on self-rule would begin May
1 between Jordan, Israel, Palestinians and any other Arabs wishing
to take part, under the auspices of the United States, the Soviet
Union, China, England and France. The plan also calls for talks to
start Dec. 1 about the future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip that
Israel captured from the Arabs in the 1967 Mideast war.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who concluded talks with
President Reagan last week, has said he was outraged by the United
States' suggestions of a withdrawal from the occupied territories.
   Shamir has rejected another U.S. proposal, for a full-scale
Mideast conference, saying such a meeting would give the Soviet
Union and its Arab allies too much influence and might force Israel
to withdraw from the territories.

   A New Mexico high school student was
selected Sunday as the nation's top student leader, winsning a
$10,000 college scholarship in the 1988 Century III Leaders program.
   Tony Ortiz, a senior at Goddard High School in Roswell, N.M.,
was chosen from among 102 student leaders who gathered Thursday
through Sunday to discuss national issues, said spokeswoman Tracy
Curtin.
   ``Being with these young people and participating in the Century
III Leaders program is enough to give an older person like myself a
lift about the future,'' said former Chief Justice Warren Burger,
who delivered the conference's keynote address.
   The program _ administered by the National Association of
Secondary School Principals _ included two students from each of
the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
   In addition to Ortiz, nine runners up each will receive $500
scholarships.
   Those nine included Erik Bliss of Santee, Calif., who attends
Helix High School in La Mesa, Calif; Brad Hammock of Morgantown
High School in Morgantown, W.Va.; Susan Hassan of Grand Blanc,
Mich., who attends Goodrich High School in Goodrich, Mich.; Donald
Kennedy of Clinton High School in Clinton, Miss., and Anna Muzzy of
Blanchester High School in Blanchester, Ohio.
   The other runners up were Christopher Roblyer of Edison High
School in Tulsa, Okla.; Brad Sears of Grain Valley, Mo., who
attends Blue Springs High School in Blue Springs, Mo.; Danny
Siciliano of Shadow Mountain High School in Phoenix, Ariz., and
Kimberly West of Enloe High School in Raleigh, N.C.
   The program is supported by the Shell Oil Company Foundation.

   Sen. Bob Dole, kicking off a Wisconsin campaign
swing Sunday, flipped two coins into a wishing well, thinking
perhaps of a badly needed win in Wisconsin's April 5 primary.
   As he strolled around a sports exposition at the city's
convention center, Dole was asked by reporters about a Milwaukee
Journal poll suggesting Vice President George Bush led him by a
margin of nearly 3-1 among Wisconsin voters considered likely to
vote in the Republican primary.
   ``There are no secrets,'' he said.
   ``I've got a lot of hill to climb before April 5,'' he said
later in an interview.
   ``I met a lot of friendly people out there. It's tough when
you're losing. It's a lot more fun when you're winning,'' he said.
   ``But I still have a lot of supporters out there. And we want
them to know Bob Dole is a fighter, that we're going to stay in
this race.''
   The Kansas senator said, however, that he would have to reassess
his standing if he lost in Wisconsin.
   ``We shouldn't be into this game about are you going to run or
are you going to drop out,'' he said.
   But he added that after Wisconsin, he would have to do some
thinking about whether to stay in the race.
   ``We've been hearing the end is near, but people forget George
Bush stayed in eight weeks after he began losing to Ronald
Reagan,'' Dole said. ``Eight weeks was enough for him to lose. But
I think eight weeks would be enough time for me to turn some things
around.''
   At the sports exposition, he was presented with a fishing rod
and fisermen's vest, and viewed a tank that served as an artifical
fishing pond containing trout. A demonstrator cast a few lines but
came up empty.
   Dole was also visiting a Veterans Administration hospital on
Sunday. On Monday, he was attending a farm day in northwestern
Wisconsin, visiting a vocational school in Eau Claire and touring a
brewery in La Crosse.
   Dole's state campaign chairman Michael Grebe said he expected
the senator's visit to be ``the kickoff to a strong effort in
Wisconsin.''
   ``We expect to have a direct mail effort, radio and television
advertising and continuing volunteer effort and volunteer phone
banks,'' Grebe said.
   Dole was trounced by Bush on Super Tuesday, and lost again last
week in Illinois. He has indicated he intends to remain in the race
at least through the Wisconsin primary.
   The Milwaukee Journal poll of 732 Wisconsin residents showed 69
percent of those planning to vote Republican preferred Bush, 25
percent chose Dole and 6 percent chose Pat Robertson.

   A government commission announced it will
begin an investigation Monday into the death of a university
student that sparked riots in the Burmese capital.
   Guards protected government buildings in Rangoon over the
weekend, following protests Friday in which demonstrators wrecked
cars, set fire to a department store and chanted anti-government
slogans.
   Some Rangoon residents said there were casualties and mass
arrests by security forces, but the government-controlled news
media was virtually silent on the disturbances.
   Open protests have been rare in Burma since President Ne Win
seized power in 1962 and instituted one-party rule.
   But over the past two years, small demonstrations and outbursts
of violence have occurred in reaction to worsening economic
conditions.
   Last September, hundreds of students in Rangoon rioted to
protest a government decision to invalidate three denominations of
banknotes.
   Friday's demonstrations began in support of students at the
Rangoon Institute of Technology, who had rioted March 12.
   One student, Maung Phone Maw, 23, was shot March 12 and the
government panel was set up to investigate his death.
   The rioting began after students clashed with local residents
over whether to play a cassette tape in a tea shop, and police then
moved in firing tear gas and making arrests.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is planning to file
suit in federal court in New York to force the closing of the PLO
observer mission at the United Nations, a department spokesman said
Sunday.
   ``We're ready to go ahead and file the papers if they don't
close the mission voluntarily,'' said spokesman Patrick Korten.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization served notice last week
that it planned to defy any U.S. effort to shut the mission, which
is in a New York City townhouse.
   Sunday afternoon, Korten indicated that the department would
file suit Monday, but Sunday evening he said that such action might
not occur until Tuesday or Wednesday due to possible delays in
paperwork.
   ``The chances are it would be within a day or two if they are
not out,'' Korten said. ``We are hoping those who walk into the
office (Monday) to look for them would find them gone. If that's
not the case, then we would proceed with legal action.''
   The Justice Department announced March 11 that it planned to
enforce the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 by going to court to close
the mission. That act takes effect Monday.
   Korten said the department planned to seek a court order
directing the PLO to vacate its offices in New York and said he
expected the court order to be ``immediately enforceable.''
   Last year, the State Department closed down the only other PLO
office in the United States, an information office in Washington,
in what was a futile attempt to head off legislation ordering the
U.N. mission closed.
   The United States and Israel consider the PLO a terrorist
organization, but the United Nations recognizes it as the only
legitimate representative for the Palestinians.

   A truck taking 71 pilgrims to a
Roman Catholic shrine on Sunday crashed through a highway guardrail
and tumbled 300 feet down a cliff, killing 65 people, police
reported.
   They said the driver was among those killed and the seven other
people aboard the truck were seriously injured.
   The accident occurred as the packed truck approached the town of
Cachoeira, 1,170 miles northeast of Rio, according to police chief
Jose Braga who was contacted by telephone by The Associated Press.
   He said the truck had left nearby Coracao de Maria to go to the
``miracle grotto'' in Sao Felix, 100 miles away.
   ``We don't know what happened yet, but it seems the bus lost its
brakes as it sped down the wooded mountain road, crashed through
the guardrail and plunged down the cliff,'' Braga said. ``The
driver was found dead clutching the handbrake.''
   He said the driver and 60 pilgrims were dead at the scene and
four died en route to a hospital.
   Among the dead were 20 children, according to Rio's Jornal do
Brasil radio station.
   Braga said police and rescue crews from six towns in the remote
region of northeastern Bahia state went to the scene.
   Truck loads of peasant families regularly make trips to the
colonial city, built in the 1700s, and the grotto to seek favors of
St. Barbara, the region's patron saint, Braga said.

<TEXT>
   A herd of a relative of the buffalo known as the
beefalo roamed onto the Florida Turnpike early Sunday, causing five
accidents and costing the lives of seven of the huge animals,
police said. One motorist was slightly injured.
   ``About 75 to 100 buffalo broke through a hole in the fence on
the Florida Turnpike Extension'' in northwest Dade County about
12:30 a.m., said Florida Highway Patrol Sgt. Alvis Chinn.
   The animals _ part buffalo, part beef cattle _ were part of a
400-head herd kept on a ranch near the turnpike extension, which
borders the Everglades northwest of Miami.
   Five of the beefalo died instantly or nearly so after they
collided with vehicles on the highway, Chinn said. ``I believe that
two other buffalo had to be killed later by the humane society,''
he said.
   The animals caused an estimated $18,000 to $20,000 damage
overall to the cars that collided with them, he said.
   The injured motorist was treated at a local hospital and
released, Chinn said.
   State troopers, animal-control officers, passers-by and workers
from the ranch herded the rest of the animals back home.
   Investigators believe the beefalo left their pasture after horse
thieves cut the fence.
   ``What they're doing apparently is stealing the horses in the
early morning hours, and they're leaving without fixing the
fence,'' Chinn said.
   Police have recorded 29 horse thefts in the area, with seven
horses stolen in the last two weeks, Chinn said.
   Dr. Arnie Oper, owner of the ranch, did not return messages left
on his answering machines Sunday.
   Oper recently made the news by offering any would-be Buffalo
Bills a chance to hunt and kill his animals for $3,500 each _ with
the hunter getting to keep the meat and the hide.

   President Jose Azcona said Sunday
the 3,200 U.S. soldiers on an emergency mission in Honduras
probably won't be needed much longer because Nicaraguan troops are
retreating from Honduran territory.
   ``Things are getting back to normal,'' Azcona said in an
interview Sunday, a day after two Honduran warplanes fired rockets
at Sandinista positions in a section of the disputed Bocay region
that Honduras considers its territory.
   ``If there are no more incidents, the Americans will leave,''
Azcona said.
   He declined to give details on the Sandinista pullback or be
more specific on when the U.S. troops that arrived last week would
depart.
   Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., a member of a congressional
delegation visiting Honduras, said he expects the U.S. military
personnel to pull out in about a week.
   ``I think it'll all be over by then,'' said Montgomery, a member
of the House Armed Services Committee.
   American soldiers practiced military maneuvers Sunday at a
Honduran airstrip about 20 miles from the Nicaraguan border.
   ``These guys are not going to get involved in any sort of
conflict,'' said Maj. Gary Hovatter, spokesman for U.S. troops in
the Central American nation.
   Nicaragua formally protested the Honduran air raid Saturday as
an unwarranted act of aggression. It has denied that its troops
crossed the jungle-choked border between the nations.
   The U.S. House delegation observed a military exercise involving
U.S. infantrymen and Honduran soldiers at Jamastran, a dirt
airstrip about 55 miles southeast of Tegucigalpa and 20 miles from
the border.
   The exercise was held about 80 miles south of the Bocay border
region.
   Honduran officials said Saturday's air strike was carried out
because about 600 Sandinista soldiers were moving too slowly from
the Bocay area. Two Honduran jet fighters carried out a similar
raid Thursday.
   No one was hurt in either raid and no damage was reported in
Saturday's attack.
   Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto sent a protest note
to Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez, saying his government
``energetically and formally protests'' Saturday's attack, which it
called ``aggression against Nicaraguan territory.''
   Honduras said the attack took place eight miles inside Honduras.
Nicaragua claims it was five miles inside Nicaragua.
   The Nicaraguan ministry also said two F-5 warplanes flew over
Sandinista positions Saturday morning in the frontier sectors of
Mukuwas, San Andres de Bocay, Waniwas and Wayawas, but did not
attack.
   The 600 Sandinistas were part of a force estimated at 2,000 that
was believed to have entered Honduran territory last week in
pursuit of U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras.
   The action prompted President Reagan to send in U.S. troops to
non-combat areas for military exercises in a show of force to the
leftist government.
   In Washington, national security adviser Lt. Gen. Colin Powell
said the fighting between Nicaragua and Honduras was essentially
over.
   Powell, who appeared on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' said the U.S. military exercises should be completed
shortly and the troops will return to the United States.
   He said ``The Sandinistas have withdrawn. They're apparently on
their side of the border again. They appear to be in a process of
withdrawing or have withdrawn.''
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua has denied that the
Sandinistas were in Honduran territory.
   On Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco said
reports that Sandinista troops remained inside Honduras territory
was a ruse by the Reagan administration to obtain more money for
the Contras.
   Tinoco also said Monday's first-ever direct talks with Contra
rebels inside Nicaragua will focus on the mechanics of a
cease-fire. The Contras want the talks to include political issues.
   In New York, the eight-nation Contadora and its support group
issued a statement condemning the sending of additional American
troops to Honduras.
   They also urged both the Honduran and Nicaraguan governments
``to reduce immediately tension in their border region and respect
each others' territorial integrity.''
   Contadora is made up of Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Panama
and is backed by a support group formed by Argentina, Brazil,
Uruguay and Peru.
   The group has been trying to negotiate an end to the Contra war
in Nicaragua and leftist guerrilla wars in El Salvador and
Guatemala for the past six years.
   Although it did not mention the United States by name, the
Contadora statement ``expressed deep worry over the escalation of a
forign military presence in ... Honduras.''

<HEAD>More Gas Cylinders Removed From Rubble Of Plant; Evacuations Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crews on Sunday removed two
cylinders of explosive gas left in the rubble of a chemical plant
where a blast killed three workers and forced 1,500 people from
their homes.
   A gas-filled cylinder sent to the Gollob Analytical Services
plant for analysis exploded Thursday. Fears of new explosions,
because another container of chemicals was still afire in the
rubble of the plant, prompted the evacuation Friday.
   Most of the 1,500 evacuees were allowed to return home Saturday
after seven cylinders near the flaming container were removed from
the plant. Sunday, the remaining 120 evacuees, nursing home
residents who lived closer to the plant than the other evacuees,
were allowed to return home and nearby businesses got the go-ahead
to reopen.
   Meanwhile, in Pocatello, Idaho, a container of what was believed
to be the same gas that caused the original explosion in New Jersey
was vented at a semiconductor plant early Sunday. Ninety-one
residents of a nearby nursing home, who had been evacuated Saturday
as a precaution, were allowed to return home.
   Before the New Jersey explosion, workers at Gollob became
worried when tests showed the gas in the tank they were testing was
not silane, which they had expected to be inside, but silane mixed
with nitrous oxide, a potent combination.
   Chicago-based Liquid Carbonic Industries Corp., which apparently
manufactured the gas, was called to pick it up, officials said.
   New Jersey Environmental Commissioner Richard Dewling has said
the tank either was mislabeled or contaminated.
   Silane, a toxic and highly flammable gas, is used by the
semiconductor industry.
   Investigators said the plant burst into flames Thursday after
the cylinder exploded outside the facility and became a projectile,
shooting into the building.
   Two cylinders containing the gas phosphine were removed Sunday
night, said James Staples, spokesman for the state Department of
Environmental Protection. The toxic, flammable gas also is used in
electronics manufacturing.
   In Pocatello, Idaho, workers at the Gould Semiconductor plant
safely vented a tank there to prevent a possible explosion, said
Jerry Corbett, a spokesman for Gould's offices in Chicago.
   The cylinder was purchased from Liquid Carbonic, Corbett said.
   Pocatello police Lt. Steve Stuart said he was told by company
officials there that a cylinder from the Gould plant had been
shipped to New Jersey after it failed to react properly in a
manufacturing process at the Pocatello plant. But Corbett would not
confirm whether a tank from the Idaho plant could have caused the
New Jersey explosion.

   A jet with 78 people aboard made an
emergency landing Sunday after a section of its landing gear
malfunctioned, and one wing caught fire briefly as it scraped the
runway, officials said. No one was injured.
   The Delta Air Lines Boeing 727 was safely evacuated by emergency
chutes after it landed about 4 p.m. at Portland International
Airport, said Port of Portland spokeswoman Sara Roberts.
   Flight 314 carried 71 passengers and a crew of seven, said David
Zielke, a Delta spokesman.
   Port of Portland spokesman Darrel Buttice said the pilot was
unable to lower the left wheel assembly, forcing the airplane to
land on the remaining two sets of wheels, right rear and center
front.
   Emergency crews put out a small fire on the left wing, which
scraped the runway as the airplane came to a halt, he said.
   ``It looked like he had everything under control and then as he
started to get close to the ground, he ... looked like he just kind
of leaned into that one side a little bit,'' said a witness, Gary
Spencer.
   ``He landed and just immediately the fire equipment was right on
top of him, spraying foam,'' Spencer said. ``I didn't see any fire
but I guess there was a little bit.''
   Inflatable yellow emergency chutes were deployed from the
doorways, and passengers were evacuated from the airplane without
incident, Ms. Roberts said. Passengers were bused from the runway
to the terminal.
   ``As far as we know, people are on their way home,'' she said.
   The flight originated in Atlanta and made a stop in Salt Lake
City before heading to Portland, Buttice said.

   The great U.S. airline giveaway seems to be
grinding to a halt.
   Worried about the potential financial impact of burgeoning
frequent-flier programs and triple-mileage travel awards, many
major air carriers have imposed restrictions on the plans or are
thinking of doing so.
   The frequent-flier plans, which reward passengers with free
tickets or upgrades to first class after they have flown a set
number of miles, were launched in 1981 to stimulate ``brand
loyalty'' to airlines in a fiercely competitive climate.
   The giveaway escalated to fever pitch at the beginning of this
year, when Delta Air Lines introduced a new program to
automatically triple the mileage accumulated by frequent fliers.
Most big airlines quickly followed suit.
   But the U.S. airline industry is facing a staggering revenue
loss if the estimated 8 million people enrolled in those programs
start redeeming their bonuses and bumping paying passengers. The
accumulated value of those bonuses is around $1.24 billion, reckons
Julius Maldutis, senior airline analyst for the investment firm
Salomon Brothers Inc.
   That compares with total industry revenue of around $46.7
billion in 1985, $50.5 billion in 1986 and just over $60 billion
last year.
   ``The frequent-flier programs have really gotten out of
control,'' said Dan Sheehy, a spokesman for United Airlines.
``We're concerned with the direction that the programs are taking.''
   John Zeeman, United's executive vice president for marketing and
planning, said in a speech early this month that the airline is
considering imposing restrictions on its frequent-flier programs.
He said the options under review include requiring that travel
awards be redeemed by a certain deadline, and even eliminating free
trips and providing only first-class upgrades instead.
   If United decides to limit its program, the changes would be
announced in early May, Zeeman said.
   Many other airlines have recently slapped restrictions on their
programs _ most notably by limiting the number of free tickets for
any one flight. But the limits being mulled by United, a subsidiary
of Allegis Corp. and the nation's largest airline, are more
far-reaching and could be matched by the other carriers.
   ``The last thing these airlines need is more damage on their
balance sheets,'' said Peter Tanous, an editor of Frequent, a
monthly newsletter on frequent-flier programs published in Colorado
Springs, Colo. ``The airlines are scared stiff that they may be
forced to take a hit against their earnings.''
   Observers warn that the Internal Revenue Service could decide to
tax the programs, sparking a ``mad rush'' by passengers to redeem
their travel bonuses. The IRS indicated recently that it considers
travel awards a form of reportable income when transportation costs
for a frequent business flier are paid by an employer.
   And the Financial Accounting Standards Board is expected to
require airlines to provide for the liability of unredeemed awards
in their 1988 financial statements.
   The looming crisis has taken hold during an already turbulent
period for the nation's airline industry. The business is coming
off one of its worst safety performances in 1987, struggling with
unions and threatened strikes against some big carriers, and
worrying about the possibility of a recession later in the year.
   For now, though, many airlines are enjoying robust passenger
traffic and earnings _ prompting them to raise fares recently and
to eliminate some discount fares.
   Analysts say nearly all the major airlines except Delta have
started to limit their frequent-flier largesse by instituting
``capacity control,'' or reducing the number of freebies on a
flight.
   ``Everyone else is doing it; you have to control and manage your
inventory,'' said Bob Gibbons, a spokesman for Northwest Airlines _
which will start capacity control on April 1 for bonuses issued
after Feb. 15.
   Even holdout Delta has ``blackout'' dates, or certain peak
travel periods when free tickets cannot be used. Delta, the third
largest airline, also has the unique requirement that frequent
fliers must charge their tickets on an American Express card.
   ``We want to remain competitive with the industry,'' Delta
spokesman Jim Lundy said when asked what might happen if United
instituted major restrictions.
   Some airlines also are looking at other approaches, such as
replacing free travel with merchandise awards or hotel and car
rental premiums.
   While they could significantly restrict their frequent-flier
programs, the airlines are not about to eliminate them or
triple-mileage awards altogether, observers say. When the
triple-mileage plans were launched at the start of the year, the
carriers assured passengers that the popular gimmicks would be
retained through 1988.
   ``We recognize that there certainly is an economic impact
associated with the triple-mileage program,'' said Frank DiNuzzo,
managing director of sales promotion for American Airlines. But, he
added, American has no intention of canceling its program.
   Indeed, some observers suggest the airlines may be caught in a
sort of ``Catch-22'' by their frequent-flier programs, forced to
keep them because there is no way to end them.
   ``I suspect that if the airlines had their druthers, they would
throw frequent-flier programs into a bonfire because they've just
become so expensive,'' said Michael J. Friedman, a vice president
of SH&E Inc., an aviation consulting firm.
   However, he noted, it would be extremely difficult for a carrier
to end its frequent-flier program without all its competitors doing
the same.

   U.S. businesses might have to pay billions of
dollars in additional state taxes if the U.S. Supreme Court upholds
Louisiana's taxation of a New Orleans store for catalogs that it
produced and mailed from other states, attorneys say.
   The case involves a disputed $43,937.03 tax assessment against
the D.H. Holmes Co. department store chain, but lawyers for both
sides agree the monetary ramifications go far beyond that.
   ``I threw out the figure of $800 million at a meeting of the Tax
Executive Institute in New York. ... People said that was a half or
a quarter of the taxes it would raise,'' William F. Grace Jr., an
attorney for Holmes, said in a recent interview.
   The case to be heard Tuesday by the Supreme Court could be the
most significant interstate commerce decision since the L.L. Bean
sales tax case in 1973, say Grace and William Pugh, a private
attorney representing the state of Louisiana.
   In the Bean case, the court ruled that mail-order companies
don't have to collect sales taxes from customers in states where
they have no employees or property.
   Use taxes such as Louisiana's are imposed on property brought in
from another state for use, consumption, distribution or storage.
Louisiana's use tax, as in most states, equals the state sales tax
minus any sales taxes charged to the purchaser.
   The catalogs in question were designed in New York, printed in
three other states and mailed from those states to customers with
Holmes charge accounts.
   ``We contend ... that Holmes did not use these catalogs in
Louisiana. There was no use by Holmes because when the taxes were
imposed, the catalogs were being transmitted in the U.S. mails,''
Grace said. ``At that time, they were not subject to tax. They can
only be taxed when they came into use in the state of Louisiana.''
   If the high court upholds state court rulings against Holmes,
Grace said, states could tax such things as flyers sent with credit
card bills, catalogs from national chains with stores in their
states, and telephone directories.
   ``All of the states are starved for revenues. They're going to
look wherever they can ...It could turn into big bucks,'' said Lee
Williams of the Washington-based American Retail Federation, which
filed one of seven friend-of-the-court briefs in the case.
   ``We think it would be a tremendous burden on business and could
be crippling to ... retailers who send tons of their advertising
and catalog materials across state lines,'' said Williams, the ARA
legislative counsel.
   Pugh said the case hinges on ownership.
   ``I would contend and did contend and shall contend that Holmes
owned the catalogs when they were designed, Holmes owned the
catalogs when they were printed, Holmes owned the catalogs when
they were mailed, and Holmes owned the catalogs when they arrived
at the post office boxes,'' he said.
   That kind of wording could mean big trouble for catalog
companies, said Bob Levering, legislative counsel for the Direct
Marketing Association in Washington, D.C.
   If the Supreme Court agrees that a company possesses and is
using something while it is being sent through the mail, Levering
said, it could bring taxes on all kinds of mailings.
   ``They (states) could say ... your property is in our state,
therefore we're providing police and fire protection for your
property,'' he said.
   Courts in Tennessee, Illinois, New York, Ohio, South Dakota,
Wisconsin and the District of Columbia have ruled the opposite of
the Louisiana courts in such matters, said Andrew Rinker Jr.,
another lawyer for Holmes.
   ``Since the Louisiana decision, Missouri has gone against us,
based on the Louisiana holding,'' he said.
   Big guns have lined up on both sides of the argument.
   One of two legal briefs supporting Louisiana was filed on behalf
of the National Governors Association, National Association of
Counties, Council of State Governments, International City
Management Association, National Conference of State Legislatures,
National League of Cities and U.S. Conference of Mayors. The other
was from the Multistate Tax Commission.
   In addition to the retail federation, the Direct Marketing
Association, the National Association of Catalog Showroom
Merchandisers and the Committee of State Taxation of the Council of
State Chambers of Commerce have filed individual
friend-of-the-court briefs. Magazine Publishers of America Inc.,
Printing Industries of America and R.R. Donnelly & Sons Co., a
catalog publisher, joined forces for another.

<HEAD>Trade Ministers Fail To Make Progress On Agriculture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONSTANCE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trade ministers from 27 countries
ended three days of informal talks Sunday without an agreement on
agriculture policy, but issues a pledge to strengthen the 95-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The deadlock on agriculture is seen as a crucial issue in
current world trade talks, which are scheduled to last four years.
   ``There was no movement of positions at all,'' Australian Trade
Minister Michael Duffy said after the meeting, which included trade
ministers from the United States, Japan and the European Economic
Community.
   The United States insists that all agricultural subsidies be
abolished worldwide by the year 2000. The EEC maintains it will
join in substantial cuts in agricultural subsidies, but rejects the
long-term U.S. proposal.
   The third big party to the agriculture policy debate is the
13-country Cairns group, the non-aligned, free-trade-oriented group
of agricultural exporters. The Cairns group is calling for
short-term measures to freeze subsidies and for long-term reform in
farm policy.
   Duffy said he outlined the Cairns group proposal to the
ministers attending the meeting, but said he got little response
from the EEC or the United States.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the Cairns group
proposal focused too much on short-term reforms.
   ``That's not good enough for us,'' Yeutter said, adding that the
United States soon would release an official reaction to the plan.
   Willy De Clercq, the EEC Commissioner for External Affairs, said
the Cairns group proposal might present ``an opening'' for further
negotiations. ``There should be a way to find common ground,'' he
told reporters.
   ``Although on the substantive level no progress was made,
eveybody seems willing to continue working to resolve the issue,''
De Clercq said.
   Failure to reach some agreement on agriculture policy by
December, when trade ministers will assess progress at the half-way
mark in the current round of trade talks, would be disastrous,
Duffy said.
   West German Economics Minister Martin Bangemann described the
mood among the ministers as excellent and said ministers had agreed
that a number of issues would be ready for ``early harvest'' by the
mid-term review in Montreal in December.
   The ministers decided to meet for more informal talks early in
October in Pakistan, Bangemann said.
   They agreed to improve GATT's surveillance of world trade
practices, as well as its dispute settlement process, and said GATT
should encourage greater cooperation with the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   One suggestion that won strong praise from the ministers was to
introduce voluntary arbitration as an alternative to the regular
dispute settlement process, Bangemann said.
   The ministers also agreed that trade in textiles should again be
governed by GATT regulations once the current Multi-Fiber Agreement
expires in 1991, he said.

   Insurance companies should pay for
efforts to detect cancer early in return for slightly higher
premiums, the head of the American Cancer Society said Sunday.
   Insurance reimbursement would help primary care doctors to do
screening and counseling against cancer, society President Harmon
Eyre told science writers at a society-sponsored conference.
   In an interview earlier, Eyre said he was talking about Pap
tests for cervical cancer, stool blood tests for colon or rectal
cancer, visual examination of the lower colon, called
sigmoidoscopy, and breast X-rays called mammograms for breast
cancer.
   In addition, he said, insurors should provide reimbursement for
``health maintenance exams,'' which include counseling about
smoking, evaluation of the mouth and lymph nodes for cancer, and
discussions about diet, weight control, and self-examination for
testicular or breast cancer.
   When a smoker is treated with antibiotics for pneumonia or
bronchitis resulting from smoking, both physican and patient are
reimbursed, he said in remarks distributed to science writers.
   ``But if that same smoker goes to a physician for counseling
about that cigarette habit, no one is reimbursed,'' he said in the
remarks. ``It is obviously more productive to prevent health
deterioration than to treat it after an illness has begun.''
   Eyre said in the interview that insurance industry
representatives have told the cancer society that expanded coverage
would mean higher premiums.
   Some companies have experimented with such policies, he said,
but people focus on ``a slight increase in the cost of their health
insurance premiums, and their first reaction is, `Well, I'm not
going to buy that.'''
   ``We haven't convinced the American public they should buy that
yet,'' Eyre said.
   ``I think he's going to have a hard time making that sale,''
said Robert Waldron, spokesman for the Health Insurance Association
of America.
   Insurance premiums rose an average of 15 to 25 percent this
year, Waldron said in a telephone interview. ``Medical costs right
now are out of control, and there's a lot of price resistance out
there ... for the things that are covered now.''
   Resistance comes both from individuals and from employers, who
buy 90 percent of the nation's health insurance, he said.
   In the long run, early detection should save money, Eyre said.
The cost of treating a cancer early is repaid with money saved from
treating an advanced case five to 10 years later, he said.
   A mastectomy to cure an early breast cancer may cost about
$5,000, while the cost of caring for a woman who eventually dies of
advanced cancer is perhaps $65,000, he said.
   Some health maintenance organizations and prepaid health
programs have picked up some screening tests, usually the Pap test,
Eyre said. He said he supports congressional interest in
legislation to require Medicare to cover mammography and Pap
testing.
   That would ``send a major signal'' to the insurance industry, he
said.
   Four states _ California, Maryland, Massachusetts and Texas _
require at least some insurance policies to cover mammograms, said
Kerrie Wilson, legislative representative for the Cancer Society.
The Massachusetts law also includes Pap tests, she said.
   The society recommends a single mammogram in women between ages
35 and 39, then another mammogram every one or two years up to age
49, and annual mammograms after that.
   Annual Pap tests and pelvic examinations are recommended for
women 18 or older or who have been sexually active. Pap tests can
become less frequent after three consecutive satisfactory
examinations.
   For colon and rectal cancer, the society recommends the stool
blood test annually after age 50 and sigmoidoscopy every three to
five years after that age, following two annual exams with negative
results.
   A poll conducted by the Gallup Organization for the cancer
society at the end of last year found increasing use of screening
tests.
   The poll found that 29 percent of respondents had had a stool
blood test, compared to 13 percent in 1976. For sigmoidoscopy, the
figure rose from 23 percent in 1983 to 28 percent in 1987.
   When asked about mammography last year, 52 percent of the women
respondents had had a breast X-ray, vs. 41 percent in 1980. For the
Pap test, 87 percent of the women reported having a test, compared
to 53 percent in 1970.
   The poll included a nationally representative sample of 1,549
adults, and had a margin of error of 4 percent, the society said.

<HEAD>Brazilian Minister Optimistic About $1.8 Billion Bank Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>

   Brazilian Finance Minister Mailson da
Nobrega indicated Sunday he was confident Brazil would get a $1.8
billion ``bridge loan'' from commercial banks to continue interest
payments on large portions of its $114 billion foreign debt.
   ``I think we're heading towards an agreement,'' da Nobrega said
after a meeting with Osamu Yamaguchi, executive director at Bank of
Tokyo's New York main branch.
   The Japanese bank represents Brazil's Asian creditors.
   The bridge loan is needed to meet interest payments owed to
private banks on more than $68 million in debt for the second
quarter of this year. Brazil declared a unilateral moratorium last
year over payments for that portion of its debt.
   Last February, Brazil resumed payments after reaching a basic
agreement with its creditor banks on a refinancing package that
would include $5 billion in new loans.
   Brazil paid $994 million of its first quarter interest payments
but still owes another $270 million to cancel the bill through
March. Brazil owes another $1.5 billion for the second quarter, da
Nobrega said Saturday.
   Da Nobrega, upon arriving in Caracas to attend the InterAmerican
Development Bank Annual Assembly, said Saturday that his country
did not have the monetary reserves to cover interest payments for
the second quarter.
   He said Brazil needed the short-term bridge loan to help meet
those payments while the new refinancing accord is ironed out.
Brazil wants a 20-year repayment accord plus a grace period of
eight years, he said.
   Yamaguchi told reporters that both the creditors and Brazil are
``more realistic'' and look for an arrangement ``as soon as
possible.''
   Da Nobrega also met with William Rhodes, a vice president of
Citicorp; Michael Hunter, of Lloyds Bank; and Leighton Coleman, of
Morgan Guaranty Trust. The Brazilian minister said the meetings
were ``good and cordial'' but declined to comment further upon them.

<HEAD>Hunts Bankruptcy Cases Requiring Millions Of Dollars, Hundreds Of
Attorneys</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sorting out the millionaire Hunt brothers'
bankruptcy court cases has required hundreds of attorneys and
millions of dollars a month in legal fees for the numerous parties
involved, according to a report published Sunday.
   Legal costs are estimated at close to $6 million monthly in the
multimillion-dollar bankruptcy cases for Dallas-based Placid Oil
Co. and the estates of William Herbert Hunt, Nelson Bunker Hunt and
Lamar Hunt, the Dallas Times Herald reported.
   ``This is an enormous case requiring an enormous amount of hours
to keep up with it,'' said Grover Hartt, the deputy attorney in
charge of the U.S. Justice Department's tax division office in
Dallas. ``It is certainly one of the biggest cases our office has
ever handled.''
   The two bankruptcy cases now involve more than 20 banks, three
federal agencies _ the Justice Department, Internal Revenue Service
and Securities and Exchange Commission _ and hundreds of creditors
employing armies of attorneys to protect their interests.
   A master list of parties involved in the Placid case includes
names of more than 150 different legal firms, said Thomas
Armstrong, an attorney with Simon, Anisman, Doby, Wilson & Skillern.
   Armstrong, as administrator of the case, sends copies of any
developments in the case to everyone on the list.
   ``This has been a seven-day-a-week case since it started. Just
keeping up is the hard part _ we (send) notices to the world every
time we do something,'' said Armstrong.
   The William Herbert Hunt estate has the largest service list
with 172 parties, Placid is second with 155 and the Nelson Bunker
Hunt estate is third with 94, court documents show. Documents for
the Lamar Hunt estate were not available.
   R. Paul Wickes, an attorney for Thompson & Knight, which
represents First RepublicBank in its dealings with Placid, said the
number of lawyers involved is proportionate to the amount of money
in question.
   ``The number (of lawyers) may be abnormal but there are not many
bankruptcies that involve close to $1 billion in assets,'' Wickes
said. ``It is the kind of case that takes a lot of people putting
in a lot of time.''
   Henry Simon, who is the lead counsel representing Placid, and
other attorneys must submit applications to Federal Bankruptcy
Judge Harold Abramson before being paid. Simon estimates he charges
$350,000 to $450,000 a month.
   Ed Creel, the lawyer representing the William Herbert Hunt
estate, estimates his fees are between $50,000 and $60,000 a month.
