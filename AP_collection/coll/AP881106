<HEAD>Parties, Unions Scramble To Boost Turnout</HEAD>

   With two Texans on the national ticket, voter turnout in the Lone
Star State is expected to be high. But elsewhere, political parties
and other groups are scrambling to get a reluctant electorate out on
Election Day.
   ``I don't see nearly as much enthusiasm as you typically see in a
presidential year,'' said Chris Verenes, executive director of the
South Carolina Democratic Party, in a comment echoed across the
country.
   With only half of the country's eligible voters expected to turn
out Tuesday, down from the 1984 figure of 53 percent, Republicans
and Democrats alike know that getting people to vote will be their
No. 1 challenge.
   The White House, 33 Senate seats and all 435 seats in the House
are at stake, and state and local races and issues abound.
   Parties, unions and other special-interest groups are running
phone banks to reach swing voters as well as the faithful. As usual,
workers will hand out leaflets, arrange for baby-sitting and escort
people to the polls. But there are also some more unusual strategies.
   In Arkansas, where the deer-hunting season opened Saturday,
Republicans mounted a mail campaign encouraging deer hunters to get
an absentee ballot if they won't be back from hunting in time for
the election. The National Rifle Association has saturated Arkansas
and a dozen other states with ads claiming Michael Dukakis would
disarm sportsmen, a charge the Democratic presidential candidate
denies.
   Coalition '88, a group of gays and others who want two California
AIDS initiatives defeated, will have hundreds of volunteers on
Election Day erecting ``human billboards'' at 70 major intersections
in Los Angeles urging voters to get out and turn down the two
propositions.
   Both parties are conducting massive drives for the state's 13.5
million registered voters but worry about the dampening effect of a
ballot with nine state initiatives and possibly hundreds of local
measures. Says state GOP chairman Bob Naylor: ``I'm very concerned
that people will be confronted with long lines at the polls, get
early results from the East Coast and absentee ballots and say,
`What the heck. I won't vote.'''
   Reasons for the low turnout projections vary, but many pundits
point to laws requiring registration days or weeks before the
election. Many voters also may simply be uninterested in the races
and find no compelling issue or inspiring candidate.
   In Alabama, where there is no race for governor, U.S. Senate or a
major statehouse post, officials expect many voters to stay home.
Oklahoma officials blame the tenor of the presidential race.
   ``There is more negative campaigning than there was four years
ago, and I think it might affect the turnout,'' says Lance Ward,
secretary of the Oklahoma election board.
   But in Texas, home state of Democratic vice presidential nominee
Lloyd Bentsen and Republican presidential nominee George Bush, the
chief election officer is predicting a record turnout. Registration
is up 345,500 from the previous high in 1984, and there is a larger
than normal number of statewide races on the ballot to boot.
   ``If we can't get them excited about this election, I don't know
what it's going to take,'' said Jack Rains, the secretary of state,
who conducted the voter registration campaign.
   In Utah, three tax-limitation initiatives are seen as the biggest
hope of getting voters to the polls. And a Maryland gun-control
referendum that's the subject of an expensive NRA campaign could
increase voter turnout there by as much as 3 percent, officials
suggest.
   Although the role of getting out the vote traditionally belongs
to the parties, unions and other special-interest groups are doing
their part.
   In Arizona, opponents of a proposed amendment to the state
constitution to make English Arizona's official language are
conducting a major get-out-the-vote campaign, focused primarily on
Hispanic neighborhoods.
   ``We will make 175,000 calls to Spanish-speaking voters and
distribute about 300,000 pieces of literature,'' said Rick DeGraw, a
political consultant coordinating the effort. ``There are 27
different organizations, some of them very small, working on this
statewide.''
   The AFL-CIO will have 500,000 volunteers out on Election Day, a
majority of them in states with the most union members which also
happen to be states with big electoral votes. The union has a
computer information bank that lets volunteers know how to reach 13
million members.
   In New Mexico, the AFL-CIO is dispatching buses to meet Carlsbad
potash miners getting off work and take them directly to the polls.
In West Virginia, the United Mine Workers union is conducting its
own telephone campaign and will have volunteers at key precincts.
   But even union officials say they are not sure they can get their
members to turn out in heavy numbers. Chris Scott, the AFL-CIO
president in North Carolina, predicted a significant dropoff from
the 1984 election and summed up the reason for some frustrated
voters:
   ``I don't believe there's a candidate running for office in this
state who's given people a positive reason to go out of their way to
vote.''

<HEAD>Rich-Poor Gap Widening, More Families Depend On Women Earners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's wealthiest families are keeping ahead
of inflation, the poorest are losing ground, and many of the rest
are holding even only because more family members are working,
according to a new economic study.
   The study conducted for the Economic Policy Institute shows a
widening gap between rich and poor since President Reagan took
office, with the top-earning 20 percent making nine times as much
money in 1986 as the poorest 20 percent, compared with seven times
as much in 1979.
   Institute president Jeff Faux said the report shows average
American families have been under greater economic pressure during
the past decade than at any time since World War II.
   ``Without new economic policies it is clear that families can no
longer count on steadily increasing incomes and that the next
generations cannot expect to live better than their parents,'' Faux
said.
   Stephen Rose, a Seattle economist who wrote the report along with
economist David Fasenfest of Louisville, said the widening gap
between rich and poor is a reversal of trends in earlier decades.
   The study concludes that without big increases in the number of
women working, as many as 60 percent of American families _ those
earning less than $40,000 a year in 1986 _ would have been unable to
keep up with inflation between 1979 and 1986, the latest year for
which complete data is available.
   The report says the number of working wives increased from 55.4
percent in 1979 to 66.1 percent in 1986.
   ``This is an important first step in measuring the real economic
benefit of having a wife work,'' Rose said in a telephone interview
Sunday. But he cautioned that more study is needed to determine the
additional costs families incur when the wife works, such as greater
need for child care.
   The institute, formed in 1986, is a non-partisan, non-profit
organization which has often been critical of Reagan's conservative
economic policies.
   It said that with more women in the work force, average adjusted
family income increased 7.3 percent from $38,492 in 1979 to $41,288
in 1986. The study multiplies 1979 earnings by 1.609 to adjust for
inflation.
   But it showed that income for the lower two-fifths of the nation,
or those earning under $27,000, is slipping behind inflation.
   Rose said the study used a standard economic practice of dividing
the country into fifths by income.
   The top group includes families that earned over $59,533 in 1986.
Their income averaged $94,104, compared with $9,133 for families in
the lowest fifth.
   The report said salaries for most working wives have increased
faster than inflation, while salaries for all but the richest
American men haven't kept up. Wives' earnings, adjusted for
inflation, increased 12.1 percent from an average $14,064 in 1979 to
$15,768 in 1986, the study said, while husbands' adjusted earnings
dropped from $23,204 to $22,240.
   It also said young adults who do not finish college are doing
``substantially worse'' than those who were the same age a decade
ago.
   Low wages are forcing growing numbers of unattached young people
_ 1.5 million more than a decade ago _ to ``return to the nest'' of
their parents' households rather than living on their own, it said.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Col. Jean-Claude Paul, the forcibly
retired commander of Haiti's most feared army unit who was indicted
on U.S. drug charges, died Sunday under suspicious circumstances, a
family friend said. He was 49.
   Radio Haiti-Inter said Paul, a 29-year army veteran and one of
Haiti's most powerful figures, died of a heart attack at about 3
p.m. in his home in suburban Fermathe. The independent station gave
no other details.
   A family friend said there was speculation Paul was poisoned,
possibly prior to having a heart attack.
   The friend, who would not be identified further, said Paul's
housemaid and yardman were arrested and taken to Petionville police
station for questioning about the colonel's death.
   Paul's former wife, Mireille Delinois, was taken to the station
Sunday night and was under police protection because of fear of
reprisals by Paul's relatives, the friend said.
   The military government's spokesman, Frantz Lubin, said he had no
information on Paul's death. U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde
also said she had nothing. The capital, Port-au-Prince, appeared
calm.
   Paul was fired Sept. 30 after a coup led by noncommissioned
officers ousted Haiti's military leader, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy,
replacing him with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   The coup leaders said they were outraged with the state-sponsored
murder and corruption Namphy tolerated.
   Paul had commanded the 700-man Dessalines Battalion, the most
brutal unit in Haiti's 7,000-member army, and had been linked to the
Tonton Macoutes, the hated private army of the 29-year Duvalier
family dictatorship.
   Soldiers under Paul's command have been blamed for widespread
violence that has thwarted moves toward democratization promised
after a popular uprising drove Jean-Claude Duvalier into exile in
February 1986.
   The violence included attacks on polling stations that forced the
cancellation of independently run general elections last November,
leaving at least 34 people dead.
   Paul had been considered one of the most powerful members of the
army, which has run this impoverished Caribbean nation for most of
its 144 years.
   In March, he was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami on
charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.
   Soldiers who staged the Sept. 17 rebellion that ousted Namphy
said they wanted to name Paul the army chief but decided not to
because of the drug charges.
   Immediately after the coup, Paul appeared to be allied with
Avril, but the new leader reportedly became concerned that Paul
might turn against him. Avril had already ousted about 60 of the
army's most repressive commanders.
   Haitian and diplomatic sources later said Paul's retirement could
help lead to the renewal of a $70 million annual aid package the
United States cut off after the November 1987 election massacre. One
of the conditions the Reagan administration has set for renewing aid
is that Haiti cooperate in halting the flow of drugs through Haiti
into the United States.
   The drug trafficking indictment alleges Paul conspired to import
220 pounds of cocaine into the United States in December 1986. It
says the traffickers used a landing strip on Paul's farm 90 miles
outside Port-au-Prince to load and fly the shipment to the Bahamas.
   Fritz Pierre-Louis, a former lieutenant in the Haitian army who
later defected, told Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Bob Graham,
D-Fla. in a special U.S. Senate hearing that 70 percent of Paul's
troops were involved in drug trafficking.
   Namphy led a military junta that assumed power when Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled into exile in France.
   An attempt to dismiss Paul in June failed and led to the fall of
the civilian government of Leslie F. Manigat, who won military-run
presidential elections in January.
   Namphy had reassigned Paul to an administrative post, but Paul
refused and was backed by Manigat. Namphy ousted Manigat on June 20,
accusing him of meddling in army affairs, and Paul remained head of
his battalion.
   Paul did not intervene when soldiers overthrew Namphy in
September.
   The soldiers who formed Haiti's new government have said they
want to end random, state-sponsored violence and institute
democratic reforms, but the government has set no dates for
elections.

   France on Sunday detonated another
nuclear device at its Mururoa testing site in the South Pacific, the
New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
observatory reported.
   It said the blast had an estimated yield of 50 kilotons and was
the 101st such test recorded since France began undergound testing
at the site in 1975.
   It was the second in a series of tests that began last week with
a 2 kiloton explosion, according to the department.

   An anti-tank grenade was fired
Saturday at the Sheraton Hotel where delegates of the Organization
of American States will meet later this month, the armed forces
press office reported.
   It said the rocket-propelled grenade missed its target and no one
was hurt when it exploded at 7:45 p.m. near the hotel in the
northern section of the capital.
   Army officials blamed the attack on leftist guerrillas who have
been fighting for eight years against the U.S.-backed government.
   The Sheraton Hotel will be the site of the OAS General Assembly
meeting from Nov. 14 to 19.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz is expected to attend at
least part of the conference.
   The army also reported that rebels attacked a small army command
post in the suburb of San Ramon, northwest of San Salvador, killing
two soldiers and wounding five. It did not mention guerrilla
casualties.

   Typhoon Skip headed toward the central
Philippines Sunday packing winds of 102 mph in the wake of a
tropical depression and two weeks after another typhoon killed
hundreds of people.
   The government weather service issued storm warnings Sunday for
the eastern Visayas islands and northeastern Mindanao. Small craft
were ordered to remain in port.
   A weather service bulletin said that as of 10:30 a.m. (9:30 p.m.
EST), Skip was about 380 miles southeast of Borongan on Samar island
and was moving west-northwest at 13.6 mph. The town lies 230 miles
southeast of Manila.
   The weather service said advance winds from the typhoon would
begin pounding Samar and other islands of the Visayas chain with
rain and gusty winds by late Sunday.
   A tropical depression code-named Tess moved into the South China
Sea on Saturday after flooding parts of the central Philippines. The
Office of Civil Defense reported at least eight people were killed
Saturday in flash flooding near Cebu, 350 miles southeast of Manila.
   The country is still reeling from the devastating effects of
Typhoon Ruby, which slammed into Samar on Oct. 24 and swept across
Luzon island with winds topping 100 mph. Officials said at least 181
people died on land.
   In addition, more than 200 people remain missing after the
passenger ship Dona Marilyn capsized and sank Oct. 24 in the Visayan
Sea about 300 miles southeast of Manila as Ruby roared through the
central islands. The ship's owners, Sulpicio Lines, said last week
that about 64 people were confirmed dead.

   Gunmen who staged a failed coup in the
Maldives and were holding 25 hostages aboard a crippled boat
surrended on the high seas to Indian navy ships Sunday, United News
of India reported.
   The agency quoting an official statement issued in New Delhi said
the foreign mercenaries surrended at 9.30 a.m (11 p.m. EST) in the
Indian Ocean between the Maldivian capital Male and Sri Lanka, UNI
said.
   There was no immediate independent confirmation of the UNI report.
   Two Indian warships had been tailing the boat and military
officers negotiated by radio with the gunmen for release of the
hostages, Indian and Maldivian officials in Male said Saturday.
   Among the captives was a Maldivian Cabinet minister, officials
said.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. reported Saturday night that the
captain of the crippled vessel said the mercenaries fatally shot two
hostages, wired the ship with explosives and threatened to blow it
up if attacked.
   The report said a BBC correspondent had spoken to the captain in
a ship-to-shore call.
   Maj. Zahir of the Maldivian security forces said he could not
verify the report. He was contacted by telephone in Male by The
Associated Press and said the captain's statement ``may have been
propaganda.''
   The BBC report identified the ship as the Progress Light. Lloyd's
Register of Ships lists the Progress Light as a 5,180-ton freighter
owned by Maldives National Ship Management Ltd. in Male.
   Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom said in a telephone
interview broadcast by the BBC in London that the safety of the
hostages was the paramount concern.
   Gayoom said Saturday from Male, ``We wouldn't want to do anything
that would engander their lives.''
   Officials said an aide to former President Ibrahim Nasir
participated in Thursday's pre-dawn attack and may have instigated
it. Nasir, who lives in Singapore, denied involvement.
   In Male, members of the security forces patrolled the gray sand
streets on Saturday. Businesses and shops were closed because of a
national day of mourning for those who died in the violence.
   Bloodstains were visible near the bullet-scarred presidential
palace and security force headquarters.
   India's top diplomat in Male said 27 to 32 people were killed
when 150 gunmen _ believed to be Tamil mercenaries from nearby Sri
Lanka _ attempted to overthrow President Gayoom.
   ``This figure is probably understated, because the mercenaries
may have removed their dead,'' Ambassador A.K. Banerjee said. He
provided no breakdown on the deaths, but said 25 people were taken
hostage aboard the vessel. Earlier reports had said there were 18 to
20 hostages.
   The mercenaries fled early Friday after Indian paratroopers
landed to help Gayoom and his lightly armed security forces in the
Indian Ocean nation, which is also known as the Maldive Islands.
   Banerjee and Foreign Minister Fathulla Jameel said they suspected
the coup was instigated by Abdullah Luthufi, a former Nasir aide.
   ``He was brandishing a gun as if he was the leader,'' Jameel said
when contacted by telephone from Colombo, Sri Lanka.
   ``He gave orders to different groups of people, and for a short
time this character went into the president's office and to satisfy
himself, he sat on the president's desk just to assert he had taken
over the country.''
   Banerjee said Luthufi and two Maldivian businessmen accompanied
the gunmen. He said said none of the three was caught and may be on
the boat with the gunmen.
   He said the cargo ship, hit by fire from Indian troops Friday,
was limping northeast at 9 mph toward Sri Lanka with the Indian
warships staying close at hand.
   He said the hostages included Transport Minister Ahmed Mujithaba.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Nasir
supporters have been trying for up to five years to recruit
guerrillas from Sri Lanka's Tamil ethnic minority. Tamil militants
have been waging a separatist war against the Sri Lankan government
since 1983.
   The diplomats said Nasir's supporters were thought to be behind
coup attempts in 1980 and 1983.
   Gayoom, 50, was first elected president in 1978 after Nasir
resigned.
   Indian paratroopers captured four gunmen Friday. Banerjee said
said other gunmen escaped in two boats, including the one with the
hostages.
   Indian paratroopers were conducting an island-by-island search
for the other boat, Banerjee said.
   Banerjee said some Indian troops withdrew from Maldives, and
reporters saw no Indian soldiers in Male on Saturday.

   A strong earthquake hit remote areas of Tibet and
Qinghai provinces in western China, seismology officials said Sunday.
   The quake measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale occurred Saturday
morning and was centered in the Tanggula Mountains about 620 miles
west of Qinghai's capital Xining, said Yang Jili at the Xining
seismology bureau.
   No casualties were reported, officials said.
   Western tourists reached by telephone in Lhasa, the capital of
Tibet more than 190 miles south of the Tanggulas, said they did not
feel any tremors.
   The State Seismology Bureau in Beijing said mild earthquakes
occur frequently in the Tanggulas, whose peaks reach 19,680 feet.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage in a populated area.

   Sri Lankan mercenaries who fled with 27
hostages in a ship after an attempted coup in the Maldives
surrendered Sunday when an Indian navy frigate fired on the vessel,
an Indian naval commander said.
   The commander said all the hostages were safe.
   He said the Indian warship Godarvari fired on the mercenaries'
ship, hitting it below the waterline.
   ``It was a controlled, minimum action to stop the boat from
moving and increase psychological pressure. There were no
casualties,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Officials said Maldivian Transport Minister Ahmed Mujithaba was
among the captives aboard the M.V. Progress Light, a Maldivian
freighter.
   The gunmen fled in the 5,100-ton vessel Friday after about 150
mercenaries tried the day before to topple President Maumoon Abdul
Gayoom, who asked India to send hundreds of troops to the Indian
Ocean island chain to help rout the attackers.
   The Indian naval commander said the mercenaries on the ship
surrendered at 9:30 a.m. 11 p.m. EST about 60 miles southwest of Sri
Lanka.
   The Maldives are about 500 miles southwest of both India and Sri
Lanka, an island nation 100 miles off the Indian coast.
   ``The hostages, numbering 27, have been flown by helicopter to
Trivandrum,'' the south Indian airport used as a staging base for
the Indian military operation that foiled the attempted coup.
   Earlier reports said 25 hostages were aboard the Progress Light,
but the naval commander said he was including the cargo vessel's
Indian captain as a captive. He did not account for the other
discrepancy.
   ``The mercenaries are to be brought to Male by ship,'' the
commander said.
   The vessel was listing badly, moving slowly and was not expected
to draw near Sri Lanka's capital city of Colombo before 5 p.m., said
Colombo port authorities speaking on condition of anonymity.
   At a news conference in the capital Male on Sunday, Fathulla
Jameel, foreign minister of the Maldives, gave an official death
toll of 14 in the attempted coup: eight Maldivian security men,
three civilians and three mercenaries. He said 40 people were
injured and four mercenaries were captured.
   He said no mercenaries were left in the Maldives, a 475-mile
chain of 2,000 coral atolls and tiny islets. He said all mercenaries
fled by boat or were captured or killed.
   Casualty figures have fluctuated widely since the coup began. On
Saturday, the Indian high commissioner (ambassador) in Male, A.K
Banerjee, put the toll at 27 to 32.
   Jameel said the mercenaries were Sri Lankan Tamils, echoing
statements made earlier by several officials in the Maldives, India
and Sri Lanka. Tamil militants are fighting a separatist war against
the Sinhalese-dominated government in Sri Lanka.
   He blamed the coup attempt on on ex-President Ibrahim Nasir and a
former Nasir aide, Abdullah Luthufi. Nasir, who lives in Singapore,
has denied involvement.
   A senior security officer in Male discounted an earlier report
that two of the hostages were killed.
   The BBC reported late Saturday night that the captain of the
Progress Light said the mercenaries fatally shot two hostages and
threw their bodies overboard. The BBC said its correspondent had
spoken to the captain by ship-to-shore radio.
   But Maj. Zahir of the Maldives' National Security Service said
the captain told him at 4:30 a.m. Sunday that no hostages had been
killed.
   Zahir quoted Capt. K. Jayadevan as saying the hostages had been
treated well. Zahir, who gave only one name, said he spoke to
Jayadevan by radio and believed the Indian captain had been
pressured by the mercenaries to tell the BBC two hostages were
killed.

   Senior Gen. Tan Zheng, a former vice minister of
defense and Long March veteran, died Sunday in Beijing, the Central
Military Commission said. He was 82.
   The official Xinhua News Agency, which carried the announcement,
did not give the cause of death or other details.
   Tan was a native of central China's Hunan province, like the late
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, and joined in an abortive peasant
uprising led by Mao in the autumn of 1927 against the Nationalist
government under Chiang Kai-shek.
   Tan briefly served as Mao's personal secretary and took part in
the Long March, the grueling 1934-35 retreat by the Red Army from
southeastern China to the northwest.
   He held political posts in the army throughout the civil war
against the Nationalists, which ended in 1949 with Communist
victory. In 1954 he became vice minister of defense and later was
named head of the army's General Political Department. He lost both
posts in the 1960s shortly before being purged during the radical
leftist Cultural Revolution of 1966-76.
   After being rehabilitated in 1975, he was an advisor to the
Central Military Commission, which sets overall military policy, and
held several posts in the legislature. He retired in 1984.

<HEAD>Emperor Vomits And Discharges Blood, Receives More Large
Transfusions</HEAD>

   Emperor Hirohito vomited blood Sunday and discharged
a substantial amount of blood twice from his bowels, palace
officials said.
   Doctors gave the 87-year-old emperor several emergency
transfusions totaling 3.4 pints, the officials said.
   The frail monarch's pulse rate rose to 118 per minute early in
the evening, Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda said.
The rate is about the same as that of a normal person while running.
   His systolic blood pressure, which has been about 150 in recent
days, dropped to 122, Maeda said.
   He said Hirohito discharged a considerable amount of blood in the
morning, then a large amount late in the afternoon. At the same time
as the later discharge, the frail emperor also vomited a small
amount of blood, he said.
   Hirohito has discharged blood from his bowels intermittently
since he became seriously ill Sept. 19. Palace officials have
described three past discharges as ``considerable,'' and one last
Sunday as ``large.''
   Doctors believe the blood is coming from a hemorrhage in the area
of the emperor's upper intestine.
   Sunday's transfusions brought the total amount of blood the
emperor has received since Sept. 19 to 38.9 pints, close to four
times the normal amount in his body.
   Maeda said Hirohito was awake and had talked to attendants in his
room in the Fukiage Palace.
   In recent days the emperor has spent much of the time sleeping,
according to palace sources. After a brief visit Saturday, his
daughter described him as fatigued.
   The emperor's temperature declined again Sunday, following a
decision by his doctors Friday to resume the use of antibiotics to
control a worsening infection around his bile duct. The doctors had
stopped the powerful drugs two weeks ago because of concerns about
possible side effects.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny reports that
Hirohito has cancer.

   A moderate earthquake hit the remote Aleutian
Islands in the Pacific Ocean off Alaska and was felt on a U.S. Navy
base there, the U.S. Geological Survey said today.
   The quake measured 5.2 on the Richter scale when it was measured
at 3:21 a.m. EST in the Andreanof Islands, part of the chain of
volcanic islands that spreads out southwest of Alaska.
   David Terrell, a spokesman for the USGS, said the center of the
earthquake was about 80 miles from Adak, an island which is about
1,000 miles from Anchorage and holds a Navy base.
   Tremors were felt on the base but there was no initial report of
damage, said Terrell.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage
in a populated area.

   Israeli warplanes raided and destroyed a
guerrilla base near the southern Lebanese city of Sidon on Sunday,
the army command said.
   The base was used for launching attacks and storing ammunition,
the army said. It said all planes that participated in the raid
returned safely to base.
   The brief army announcement gave no further details.
   Lebanese reports said the attack was carried out by helicopter
gunships which fired four rockets in two sorties against Palestine
Liberation Organization bases in the Ein-el-Hilweh refugee camp.
   Lebanese police, who had no immediate report of casualties, said
Israeli-backed militiamen also clashed with leftist guerrillas east
of Sidon.
   The raid was the sixth by Israel in southern Lebanon in three
weeks and the 21st this year. By police count, 108 people have been
killed and 199 wounded since Jan. 3 in the earlier raids. Sunday's
raid followed mock dive-bombing runs by Israeli aircraft over
Palestinian bases east of Sidon.

<HEAD>Yellowstone Snow Studied for Effects of Summer Fires on Animals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientist is studying the effects of last
summer's fire in Yellowstone National Park by analyzing urine-soaked
snow to determine whether animals are getting enough to eat.
   Biologist Glenn DelGiudice perfected the testing, which experts
think has great promise for aiding wildlife studies around the world.
   ``Glenn's technique is generating a great deal of excitement
among researchers,'' said L. David Mech, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service scientist who is an internationally known wolf expert. ``It
can be applied anywhere animals live in snow for part of the year.''
   Mech and Ulysses S. Seal, a biochemist widely recognized for his
research on endangered wildlife, initiated the technique of using
snow-urine samples in wildlife research. But several years ago, they
turned over perfection of the technique to DelGiudice, then a
graduate student at the University of Minnesota.
   For the past two years, DelGiudice has studied Yellowstone's elk
and bison under an agreement between the Veterans Administration,
for whom he works, and the National Park Service, which manages the
2.2 million-acre park in Wyoming.
   DelGiudice's work will allow scientists to compare the health of
the bison and elk before and after the summer fires, which affected
500,000 to 880,000 acres in Yellowstone. There are no findings yet
from the study.
   About 20,000 elk and 2,600 bison spend the winter in Yellowstone.
The Park Service estimates that four bison and 250 elk died in the
fires, which simply forced most big mammals into different parts of
the park to find forage.
   DelGiudice was among about 25 scientists who recently met at
Yellowstone to prepare a plan for studying the effects of the fires.
He stressed that, while the fires charred extensive timber and
brush, the burned-over areas form a mosaic pattern, rather than a
contiguous tract.
   That's important, DelGiudice said, because while vegetation has
not yet returned to areas burned in late summer, young plants
already have emerged in tracts that were charred earlier. Those
plants should help bison and elk survive this winter.

   Queen Elizabeth II's corgi dogs are being treated
by an animal psychologist because of their bad record of nipping
members of the royal household, The Mail on Sunday reported.
   The paper said guardsmen, policemen, footmen and even the royal
clockwinder have fallen prey to the corgis' nips.
   Buckingham Palace refused comment. ``I don't think we'd like to
comment on that kind of story,'' said a palace spokesman who by

   The dogs are being seen by animal behavior specialist Dr. Roger
Mugford, who firmly believes in counseling owners as well, The Mail

   Mugford, whose office was closed Sunday, was quoted by the paper
as saying of corgis: ``They are, of course, collie-type dogs,
originally bred for cattle herding. As such, they will chase
anything, particularly ankles.''
   The present generation of royal corgis, according to the paper,
are named: Spark, Mist, Sable, Diamond, Kelpie, Phoenix, Piper,
Chipper and Harris. The article did not say how many of the dogs are
receiving treatment.

   China's Hainan Island approved the death penalty
for anyone convicted of forcing women to be prostitutes, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
   The provincial government enacted the law Saturday as part of a
crackdown on prostitution and venereal disease, which officials say
have infiltrated all walks of life on the island, the China News
Service reported.
   The island off the southern Chinese coast also approved laws in
which prostitutes and customers would be fined $1,300 and jailed two
weeks upon conviction. Those who commit ``severe cases'' will be
sent to labor camps, the report said. It did not explain ``severe
cases.''
   Prostitution is reportedly more prevalent in areas where the
communist government's economic reform policies have encouraged
private enterprise and labor mobility. Hainan was named China's
newest Special Economic Zone this year to attract foreign investment.

   The teams have picked up more than 10,000 tons of cabbage, the
Beijing Daily said. The cabbage fell off some of the hundreds of
trucks piled high with the produce that began rattling into the city
from farms last week.
   More of the leaves were scattered at marketplaces where families
bought cartloads of cabbage, a staple they stack on their roofs or
fire escapes and eat over the winter months.
   More than 500 garbage trucks and more than 2,000 workers were
enlisted in the clean-up effort, the paper said.
   Beijing residents are expected to buy more than 660 million
pounds of cabbage this season, or more than 66 pounds for each of
the city's nearly 10 million people.

<HEAD>Democrats Gun for Bigger Senate Advantage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is an unusual unanimity this year about
prospects for the Senate in Tuesday's balloting: Democrats will
remain in control, and may well increase their eight-seat advantage.
   ``The Democrats will hold onto 54 seats at a minimum, and I
believe have a very good opportunity to add,'' said Sen. John Kerry
of Massachusetts, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
   ``We realize it's still quite volatile out there,'' said Tom
Mason, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
``We could end up on Election Day minus two. But we could just as
easily be plus two or better.''
   One reason little change is expected is that, unlike some past
presidential elections, there has been no overriding national theme
dictated by the top of the ticket, the kind of compelling issue that
would propel voters to seek massive changes.
   Rather, polls have show a general contentment with the status
quo, and that works to the benefit of incumbents.
   That advantage extends to the House, where very little movement
is expected in the Democrats' 255-177 majority.
   ``There isn't the thematic difference'' that has pervaded
presidential contests in the past, Mason said. ``President Reagan
said it best: We are the change. It's not as clear a mandate as in
1980, when there was such a screaming need for change.''
   That was the year Republicans rode Reagan's coattails to a
12-seat pickup and control of the Senate for the first time in a
quarter-century. In 1986, an eight-seat gain enabled Democrats to
retake control.
   This time, Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis
have been criticized for running a race devoid of issues, devoted
mostly to personal attacks and distortions of each other's records.
   So issues in this year's Senate campaign have been largely drawn
from a list of topics that Democrats claim as their own, although
they have been used by candidates of both parties: the environment,
education, Social Security, health care and ``family issues'' like
child care.
   Also prominent in Senate stump speeches and advertising have been
the problems of drugs and crime, which register near the top of
Americans' concerns in national polls.
   Most Senate incumbents of both parties appeared likely to win
re-election on Tuesday, but there were several prominent exceptions.
   Analysts said Republican Sen. David Karnes, who was appointed in
1987 to fill an unexpired Nebraska Senate term, was the most likely
to be ousted. Democratic former Gov. Bob Kerrey, a popular figure
with a Hollywood-like appeal in the state, held a heavy lead in
polls.
   Three other incumbents _ two Republicans and one Democrat _ also
faced difficult battles for survival.
   In Nevada, GOP Sen. Chic Hecht, who for months had been
considered the most vulnerable Republican incumbent, has fought back
to a dead heat with his challenger, Democratic Gov. Richard Bryan. A
political action committee of import car dealers was pouring
$382,000 into mass mailings and TV spots for Hecht, and Hecht was
running ads linking himself to Bush and Bryan to Dukakis.
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, the veteran maverick Republican from
Connecticut, has resorted to his own negative ads attacking
challenger Joseph Lieberman, the state's Democratic attorney
general. The race is the most complex political matchup in the
country. Lieberman has sought to outflank Weicker by portraying him
as aloof from Connecticut concerns, and has attracted support from
all parts of the political spectrum.
   Republicans hungry for an upset were pointing to Montana, where
they claimed to have Democratic incumbent John Melcher on the run.
His GOP rival, Yellowstone County Commissioner Conrad Burns, was
running positive biographical ads in the closing days of the
campaign, while Melcher was airing man-in-the-street testimonials
advising against sending ``a greenhorn'' to Washington.
   Six open seats, where no incumbent was seeking re-election, were
the other major battleground. Democratic former Virginia Gov.
Charles Robb appeared poised to claim a formerly Republican seat,
and Rep. James Jeffords, R-Vt., was likely to enter the Senate from
his state. Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss., also seemed to be holding
firmly to a polling lead in his bid to replace retiring Democratic
Sen. John Stennis.
   But in three other open seats, the outcome was up for grabs.
   Former Sen. Slade Gorton, a Republican, picked up a spate of
last-minute newspaper endorsements in his bid to keep Washington's
Senate seat in GOP hands, but polls showed Democratic rival Rep.
Mike Lowry in a dead heat.
   Florida promised a similar cliffhanger, with Democratic Rep.
Buddy MacKay seeking to beat out Republican Rep. Connie Mack in a
state where Bush held a heavy advantage. Like Hecht, Mack was
receiving substantial last-minute backing from the import car
dealers PAC.
   In Wisconsin, Democrat Herb Kohl, a millionaire who owns the
Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, was holding onto a narrowing lead
in his effort to retain the seat of retiring Sen. William Proxmire
for the Democrats. Republican state Senate minority leader Susan
Engeleiter was pressing hard, and both Bush and Reagan campaigned
for her in the state.

   George Bush relishes talking about how he and
President Reagan solved the ``malaise'' of the Jimmy Carter years,
when inflation was in double digits and the prime interest rate
soared past 20 percent.
   ``Now, with low inflation and low interest rates, housing is
again within reach of America's families,'' boasts Bush, the
Republican presidential nominee. ``Sound Republican policies have
helped more families than ever to realize the dream of home
ownership.''
   Interest rates did come down, but housing prices rose rapidly and
a smaller percentage of Americans live in their own homes today than
when the Reagan administration started: 63.7 percent compared with
65.6 percent in 1980.
   Tenants in many cities are confronted with soaring rents and a
dwindling supply of apartments. Homelessness has become a major
social ill, with estimates of the number of people living on the
streets or in shelters ranging from 250,000 to 3 million.
   It adds up to a crisis in housing for millions of Americans that
poses a major challenge for the next president.
   The vice president's Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis, has
sought to make housing one of the major campaign issues to support
his claim that ``I'm on your side.''
   Despite his upbeat talk, Bush has acknowledged the problems and
offered the outlines of the strategy he would employ to solve them.
   Bush has promised that one of his chief goals ``will be to see
that all American families are able to obtain decent, affordable
housing. ... To do this, we will maintain the policies that have
brought us low inflation, low interest rates and strong job
creation, which have given many Americans the income to buy homes.''
   Dukakis wants to allow first-time home buyers to withdraw up to
$10,000 in tax-free savings from their Individual Retirement
Accounts or 401-K accounts to apply toward their downpayments.
   Dukakis went to Levittown, N.Y., the post-World War II model
community, to unveil his plan called Home START (Saving Toward An
Affordable Residence Today). It would cost the Treasury $400 million
in lost revenues.
   Both candidates propose relaxing Federal Housing Administration
loan rules for first-time buyers.
   Bush says he will ask the FHA to experiment with reduced
downpayments, possibly as low as $1,000. He also wants the FHA to
allow higher loan limits in expensive housing areas.
   Dukakis' Home START would allow people to get FHA mortagages with
only 3 percent down. The agency now requires 3 percent down for the
first $25,000 and 5 percent for the remainder of the purchase price.
   Dukakis also would remove the current ceiling on FHA loan
guarantees of $67,000 nationally and up to $101,250 in high cost
areas, and would expand FHA financing of adjustable rate mortgages.
   Bush, criticized by Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas during the GOP
primaries for saying most of the homeless were mentally ill, now
acknowledges that ``too many are families with children.'' He
promises to form public-private partnerships to build more
single-room occupancy shelters, and he backs the $280 million
McKinney Act to aid the homeless.
   Bush is an enthusiastic supporter of housing vouchers for the
poor and allowing tenants to take over ownership of public housing.
   Both Bush and Dukakis support the home mortgage interest
deduction.
   Bush notes that the United States built its 100 millionth home
last year, and that housing starts were 25 percent higher in 1987
than in 1980. Builders have constructed 10 million homes in the past
six years.
   But with the median price of new homes up to $112,400 in the
second quarter of 1988, many young families find it increasingly
difficult to climb onto the first rung of the housing ladder.
   ``Since this administration took office, the price of houses has
raced ahead of people's wages and has made it impossible for many
people to buy the homes they grew up in,'' Dukakis charged.
   Reagan cut deeply into the budget for the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, which has fallen from $34 billion to $15
billion.
   The government, which used to help build or rehabilitate 200,000
units of housing for low and moderate income families each year, now
backs just 25,000.
   Dukakis promises to launch a National Partnership for Affordable
Housing to spur construction of low and moderate income housing with
federal grants and other support.
   A report last March by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at
Harvard University warned, ``America is increasingly becoming a
nation of housing haves and have-nots.''
   ``Young households find purchasing a first home especially
difficult. ... Unable to secure a home of their own, these persons
remain renters and bid up the price of rental housing,'' the center
said.
   ``The problem of first-time home buyers has gotten worse during
the (past) eight years,'' said Stephen D. Driesler, the National
Association of Realtors senior vice president for government
affairs. For people who already owned homes, ``the Reagan years were
very good.''
   According to the Census Bureau, the homeownership rate among
households in the 24-29 age group fell from 43.3 percent in 1980 to
35.9 percent in 1987, while the rate fell from 61.1 to 53.2 percent
for those in the 30-34 age group.
   The National Association of Home Builders says the 1986 overhaul
of the nation's tax code stripped away many incentives to build
apartments. Builders are starting only 385,000 multifamily units
this year, down from 669,000 in 1985.
   ``The rent burden has become particularly onerous for young,
single-parent families whose rents have increased from 34.9 percent
of their incomes in 1974 to 58.4 percent in 1987,'' a report by the
home builders says.

<HEAD>Video Warns Students That Unwed Parents Must Pay Child Support</HEAD>

   Long after they've paid for their stereo
or first car, some Mississippi teen-agers could be making monthly
payments they never anticipated _ child support.
   Faced with the highest percentage of teen-age pregnancies in the
nation, the Mississippi Welfare Department wants youths to know they
can be held financially responsible for illegitimate offspring.
   A new educational program, which will include a video
presentation and a brochure, explains that if an unwed mother
accepts welfare benefits, she must help locate her child's father.
Once a court has ordered child support payments, the state can
collect them to offset welfare costs. If the mother refuses, her
portion of the family's welfare benefits will be cut.
   The program, geared for junior and senior high school students,
is being explained personally by state Welfare Commissioner Thomas
Brittain to school boards around the state. The schools can decide
how to use the program.
   It points out the state's right to require men to submit to blood
tests to legally establish paternity.
   ``We owe it to the taxpayers to have the young men begin to take
responsibility as well,'' Brittain said last week as he explained
the program to school officials.
   Of all babies born in Mississippi during 1987, 20 percent, or
8,302, were born to teen-age mothers, said Jane Lee, director of
reproductive health for the state Health Department.
   Too many of those children end up on welfare rolls, Brittain said.
   ``We want to take a message out to young men as well as young
women that there's a hard economic consequence to an unwed
pregnancy,'' he said.
   ``That economic consequence is that if you participate in having
someone become pregnant, then you're going to pay that child support
payment until that child is 21 years of age.''
   ``When we begin to diagram that out for students and show them
what that means, they'll say back to us things like, `Gee, I've got
this part-time job and I need the money for paying for my stereo or
I need the money for gasoline,' and we basically will be saying,
`Tough luck, that money first has to go for child-support
payments,''' Brittain said.
   The welfare department has sought bids for the teen-age
parenthood video, which should be ready for distribution to
classrooms in January, Brittain said.
   The program also has a dollars-and-cents guide that extends into
the students' adult lives, Brittain said.
   Students will be given a chart listing how much they can expect
to earn in several occupations ranging from a minimum-wage job to
corporate executive.
   The chart also tells them how much they could expect to pay in
child support. For example, if a student someday becomes a janitor
and makes $700 per month, then he can be required to pay $119
monthly, or $29,988 covering his child through age 21.
   Brittain explained that the state can enforce child support
collections by requiring an employer to withhold a portion of the
parent's pay check, by intercepting state and federal tax refund
checks, and by putting liens on real estate and personal property.
   Information regarding past-due child support will be distributed
to credit reporting agencies for determining the parent's credit
rating, Brittain said.
   Yazoo County school board member Arthur Nichols said he thought
the new educational program could prevent some teen-age pregnancies.
   ``I think it would wake me up pretty quick,'' Nichols said.
   Brittain said the educational program is similar to those offered
by welfare departments in Georgia and California.
   He said the plan also was presented recently to the state's
judges association, since the courts are responsible for setting
child support payments.
   Chancery Judge Billy Bridges of Rankin County has volunteered to
speak to students.
   ``I enforce it just like I do in a divorce case,'' the judge said
of child support involving unwed parents. ``I would assume that all
judges take the same position that I do. It's the law.''

   A contagious virus that causes a
respiratory infection and high fever was to blame for the deaths of
thousands of seals in the North Sea during the summer, a researcher
said Sunday.
   Nina Hedlund Markussen, a biologist appointed by the Norwegian
Oceanic Research Institute to study the seal deaths, said the
epidemic appears to be over in Norwegian, Danish and Swedish waters
but that some cases of seal death are still registered by Britain
and The Netherlands.
   Hedlund Markussen was quoted by the national NTB news agency as
saying: ``Autopsies and analyses carried out at the Veterinary
Institute give no factual evidence that the illness symptoms causing
the seal deaths have anything to do with pollution or distemper. A
contagious virus appears to cause the symptoms and subsequent
infection of the respiratory passage with coughing and fever up to
41 degrees Celsius (102 F).''
   Researchers estimate that nearly 12,000 seals along the coasts of
North Sea countries died during the summer because of the illness.

<TEXT>
   Central America is becoming one of the most
inhospitable and risky areas for U.S. diplomats and military
personnel.
   Nagging concerns over personal security, widespread anti-American
sentiment and the career risk of having to defend highly
controversial U.S. policies plague U.S. officials assigned in the
region, particularly in Panama, El Salvador and Nicaragua.
   As an example of the potential risk to career advancement, Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., an outspoken critic of administration
policy in the region, recently blocked the promotion of two foreign
service officers stationed there.
   A country-by-country rundown of the difficulties facing U.S.
personnel:
   Panama _ In October, U.S. Marine sentries at Howard Air Force
Base exchanged gunfire on four occasions with unidentified
intruders. Between February and October, there were 240 reported
cases of harassment of American servicemen in Panama, according to
the U.S. Southern Command.
   In September, the administration decided to reduce the U.S.
diplomatic presence because of what one official called a
``potentially confrontational situation'' linked to continued
U.S.-Panamanian hostility.
   The administration's decision not to have dealings with Panama's
military-dominated government has produced a variety of problems for
U.S. diplomats. Some are forced to drive with expired licenses
because the government won't renew them, while others rent cars
rather than risk driving with expired plates.
   El Salvador _ Concern over personal security has heightened with
stepped up leftist rebel activity in San Salvador, the capital. In
late October, the offices of the U.S. Agency for International
Development were struck by a projectile that cracked several windows
and caused minor damage.
   In previous years, the U.S. Embassy has been the target of rebel
attacks on several occasions but without serious incident. Diplomats
posted in El Salvador long have been security conscious, never
taking the same route twice in a row when commuting. To avoid
detection, one diplomat had his car repainted every few weeks.
   Nicaragua _ In July, U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and seven
other members of the embassy staff were expelled by the Sandinista
government on grounds of interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs.
   Nicaragua has refused to allow the State Department to send
replacement envoys to Managua, placing an unusually heavy work load
on the remaining skeleton staff. Their mission is complicated by an
atmosphere of almost complete mistrust between the two governments.
   Several State Department officials said the biggest concern of
U.S. diplomats posted in the region is not personal security but the
possibility that their association with President Reagan's policies
could damage their careers.
   Dodd recently blocked the promotions of Everett Briggs, U.S.
ambassador to Honduras, and David Dlouhy, who is stationed in El
Salvador and spent a brief period as head of the embassy.
   Dodd complained that the two envoys impeded congressional
attempts to exercise oversight of U.S. policy. His action
underscored the continuing animosity between the administration and
Democratic liberals over Central America.
   Dlouhy accused Dodd of ``McCarthyite tactics that would send a
chilling message to the Foreign Service.''
   Said Perry Shankle, president of the American Foreign Service
Association, the union of career diplomats: ``As a career officer
you do put your career on the line in these highly charged
situations. There are a lot of dangers involved.''
   Despite the risks, there is no shortage of career diplomats
willing to serve in Central America, State Department officials say.
One reason is that service in that region is a quick route to
``in-house'' promotions, the officials say, noting that
congressional approval is required only for promotions involving the
highest ranking officials.
   Still, Central America has been a career-threatening area for
some time. When the Reagan administration assumed office eight years
ago, numerous officials who had a hand in implementing President
Carter's policy in Central America were either fired or sent to
low-priority areas as punishment for perceived misjudgments.
   The most dramatic example was Carter's last assistant secretary
for Latin America, William Bowdler, who shortly before Reagan's
first inaugural was summarily evicted from his office. Shattered by
the experience, he soon left the Foreign Service and has lived in
virtual seclusion with his wife in southern Virginia ever since.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Solicits Help In Curbing Loan Defaults</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos is seeking
the advice of thousands of lenders, colleges and universities, and
public officials on how to hold down the escalating default rate on
student loans.
   The Education Department says taxpayers spent $1.5 billion to
cover defaults on the guaranteed student loan program in the fiscal
year that ended Sept. 30, almost 43 percent of the program's entire
cost.
   The figure represents a 200 percent increase over the past five
years in what is now known as the Stafford loan program, the
department said.
   ``We want the advice of all parties _ the Congress, the public,
schools, lenders, guarantee agencies and borrowers,'' Cavazos said
in a statement. ``A lot has already been done, but clearly,
additional action is necessary.''
   The program has loaned about $40 billion since it began. Of the
current $12 billion in outstanding loans, about $5 billion is
overdue, the department said.
   Charles Kolb, acting deputy undersecretary for planning, budget
and evaluation, said Cavazos has sent letters appealing for advice
to more than 7,000 participating colleges and universities, 13,000
lenders, 54 agencies that guarantee student loans, 50 governors, and
members of Congress.
   Cavazos, who was president of Texas Tech University until taking
over as education secretary in September, is also accepting
suggestions from students. He is especially concerned about those
who defaulted on their loans because they were unable to earn a
living after attending unscrupulous trade or other schools that
award a certificate but do not provide necessary job skills.
   Kolb said some schools have 100 percent default rates, suggesting
they may not be providing the kind of education necessary for
students to hold a job and earn enough money to repay their loans.
   ``There are a lot of scams going on here,'' Kolb said.
   A school must be accredited to qualify students for guaranteed
student loans, but Kolb said there are still ``fly by night
operations'' that ``don't give students a technical background _
just a paper certificate, no skills, and a debt.
   ``It's getting just unbelievable. Schools are recruiting right
out of welfare lines. They get the students to get federally backed
loans and the school gets the money and the kid gets the debt,''
Kolb said.
   Kolb said former Education Secretary William Bennett had proposed
that schools that fail to get their default rate below 20 percent
could be cut from the program. Cavazos has extended the comment
period on that proposal until the end of February.
   Kolb said of the 7,300 schools participating in the program, 30
percent have default rates above 20 percent.
   Cavazos also wants to know to what extent lenders, guarantee
agencies and schools should share in the risk and cost of defaults;
how communication can be improved among those participating; whether
credit reports and co-signers should be required for borrowers with
poor credit histories; and how consumer and personal financial
counseling can be used most effectively.

   The author of ``Cultural Literacy: What

capital of Florida _ no matter what it says on page 382 of his
sequel.
   But E.D. Hirsch said he didn't know Tallahassee, Florida's
capital for 175 years, had been snubbed in ``The Dictionary of
Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs To Know.''
   ``Don't tell me that,'' he told the Tallahassee Democrat in a
telephone interview Friday. ``Tell Joe Kett that. Let's let him have
this conversation.''
   Kett and Hirsch, both professors at the University of Virginia,
are co-authors of the dictionary.
   Kett ``won't live that one down for a long time,'' Hirsch told
the newspaper. ``You tell your readers you called me up and I knew
the capital.''
   On page 382 of the sequel to Hirsch's bestseller is this listing:
``Jacksonville Capital of Florida, located in northeastern Florida.''
   The book's chapter on American geography begins: ``Tests have
revealed that many Americans are amazingly ignorant of the geography
of their nation.''

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Has Shouting Match With Foreign Journalists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a bitter shouting match with
journalists, Foreign Minister Pik Botha described the foreign media
as ``thieves and enemies'' who know ``absolutely nothing'' about
South Africa.
   Botha held the exchange with journalists during a hostile
question-and-answer period that followed his speech at a Saturday
night dinner banquet put on by the Foreign Correspondents
Association.
   Among other issues, questions touched on the closing of an
anti-apartheid newspaper and on detentions of anti-apartheid
activists.
   ``I am sick and tired of a lot of foreign representatives
descending on my country and picking up on all the dirty work
instead of all the beauty, promise and goodwill,'' Botha said after
an argumentative exchange with one journalist.
   ``You don't understand Africa. You don't understand African
aspirations. You don't understand African history,'' he said.
   The 400 people attending included foreign and local journalists
and their guests, such as U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins.
   ``I accuse you of being superficial. I accuse you of glibly
gliding over the African realities of which you know nothing,
absolutely nothing,'' Botha told the audience.
   After a prolonged exchange with one women, he said: ``I don't
want to quarrel with beautiful ladies. I do better things with
them.''
   He wondered out loud whether one questioner had ``psychological
problems.''
   ``Will you just sit down and listen to a man who has traveled
through Africa,'' Botha told another persistent questioner.
   ``Blacks don't want a Westminster-style democracy,'' he said.
``Even if you could remove all the whites from South Africa tomorrow
... what you put here will not work.''
   Asked about last week's government suspension of the
anti-apartheid Weekly Mail newspaper, Botha said he supported the
move. He described the newspaper as one of the most ``vicious'' he
has seen in his travels around the world and said it contributed to
``more violence in this country.''
   Asked why members of an extreme right-wing white group are not
detained as frequently as anti-apartheid activists, Botha said:
``Don't be stupid. It's not a question of arresting a few people and
that's the end of it.''
   ``There are whites in this country who can put together a more
efficient violent organization than the ANC (African National
Congress guerrilla movement),'' Botha said.
   The ANC is the main group fighting South Africa's white-led
government and its system of apartheid, under which the black
majority has no voice in national affairs.
   At the end of the hour-long impromptu debate, the host offered to
thank Botha, but the foreign minister refused to accept. Instead he
returned from his seat to the podium and quoted a speech by Paul
Kruger, a 19th century South African politician.
   ``(Kruger's) opening words were, `friends, citizens, thieves and
enemies.' And that is how I look at you this evening,'' Botha said.
   The audience responded with boos, hisses and shouts of ``go
home!'' Botha left shortly afterward, before dessert was served.
   South Africa's media restrictions have been further tightened
under the 29-month-old state of emergency. The emergency regulations
prohibit reporting on security force actions, most forms of protest
and a wide range of statements the government considers subversive.
Enforcement has not been comprehensive.

   An amateur diver found more than 20 crates of
ammunition in the Gulf of Gela near the beach where allied troops
invaded Sicily in 1943, a news agency said Sunday.
   The diver found the crates in an unidentified wreck, ANSA
reported. The diver opened one crate and found it full of ``military
type ammunition.'' The navy will recover the other crates, which may
include weapons, ANSA said.
   Police believe the munitions were lost during the allied invasion
in July 1943, but they have not ruled out the possibility the
shipment was the result of illegal arms traffic along the southern
Sicilian coast, ANSA said.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis don't advocate a
shortened school week. But they probably never consulted
fifth-grader Erica Dobbs when they wrote their education platforms.
   ``I would make my school meet every other day,'' wrote Erica, who
also would push for longer recess and no classes in May if she were
elected president.
   Erica is too young to be on the ballot Tuesday, but she's old
enough to imagine how the country would be run if she were in the
Oval Office.
   Child's Play, a theater troupe, brought those dreams to the stage
Saturday when it presented ``Kids for President,'' a 45-minute
production based on the writings of 400 Chicago elementary school
students.
   If elected president, the youngsters said they would rig Lotto
games so their friends would get rich; turn the White House into a
toy factory and order congressmen to build toys; hire an expert chef
to prepare school lunches; elect Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan
mayor of Chicago, and end federal ``spending on dumb things.''
   ``Kids want to be listened to, to be talked to,'' said June
Podagrosi, executive director of Child's Play and one of six people
who acted on stage. ``Their naivete is wonderful. They have creative
solutions, pure solutions.
   ``But these kids also know what's going on,'' she said. ``There
is a great social awareness about war, the homeless, drugs and
AIDS.''
   Fifth-grader James Willis said he would send the homeless to the
roomy mansions owned by pop stars Prince and Michael Jackson.
   The theater troupe and the Children's Bookstore collected 400
writing samples from students around Chicago. The 40 best entries _
serious and silly _ were performed.
   The authors were invited downtown to the Goodman Studio Theatre
for the free show. After the show, the actors summoned the students
to the stage for a ``creativity certificate.''
   Since they won't be president in 1988, what would the youngsters
tell Bush or Dukakis if they met them?
   ``That's easy,'' said Joseph Norfleet, 9. ``I think they
shouldn't make promises they can't keep.''

   A man whose fight with cancer inspired
co-workers to donate their vacation time to help support his family
of six has died at the age of 34.
   Randy Theis died Saturday at Iowa Methodist Medical Center,
apparently from a blood clot that lodged in a lung, said his
father-in-law, Charles Comegys.
   He had been hospitalized since Sept. 30, when he underwent cancer
surgery. After an operation in May, Theis had been left with just
two weeks of vacation time and sick leave.
   Fellow employees at the Des Moines Water Works donated more than
12 weeks of their own vacation time and personal leave to help
support Theis' family while he fought the disease.
   Theis, a pipeline worker, is survived by his wife, Nancy, two
sons, three daughters, his parents and five brothers.

   Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed the
shop of a boat dealer suspected of links with PLO guerrillas Sunday,
demolishing the business and wounding five people, two of them
seriously, police said.
   The Israeli army said its warplanes destroyed a Palestinian
guerrilla base in south Lebanon. It did not mention casualties.
   Lebanese police said four Israeli Cobra helicopter gunships
blasted the shop and a nearby citrus grove with eight rockets in two
sorties. The shop in the southern port of Sidon was closed at the
time.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the shop owner, Mahmoud Hijazi, was suspected of
renting two motorboats to PLO guerrillas and selling the guerrillas
spare parts.
   It was the sixth Israeli air strike against guerrilla targets in
south Lebanon in three weeks and the 21st this year. By police
count, 108 people were killed and 204 wounded in raids since Jan. 3.
   Hijazi's motorboats, anchored off the beach about 600 yards from
his shop, were not hit in the raid, police said.
   Earlier police reports said aircraft attacked guerrilla bases in
the teeming Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on Sidon's southern
outskirts. Police said the guerrillas in the camp opened up with
anti-aircraft fire but were not targeted by the Israeli aircraft.
   Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen also killed three guerrillas
who apparently landed in a boat on the Meditteranean coast just
north of Israel, the army command said.
   An Israeli army announcement said the base attacked Sunday was
used for launching attacks and ammunition storage. It said all
planes that took part in the raid returned safely.
   The brief announcement gave no further details.
   The attack followed mock raids by six Israeli jets against the
Palestinian guerrilla strongholds at midmorning.
   Palestinian camps south of Sidon have taken the brunt of the
stepped-up Israeli raids, which have by police count have killed 40
people and wounded 91 in the past three weeks.
   The blitz is in apparent retaliation for a suicide car-bombing
that killed eight Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon on Oct. 19 and a
firebomb attack that killed an Israeli mother and her three children
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank Oct. 30.
   Also Sunday, Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militiamen killed
three guerrillas in a firefight near Naqoura, about two miles north
of the border with Israel. There were no SLA casualties, the
military command said.
   The army said the guerrillas apparently landed from a boat and
were hiding in the area. One of the guerrillas fired a
rocket-propelled grenade at the patrol before being killed, it said.
   Two other guerrillas were found shortly afterward and were killed
in a firefight, the army said. It did not identify the group to
which the guerrillas belonged.
   The clash was in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in south
Lebanon, a six- to 10-mile zone carved out when Israel withdrew the
bulk of its occupation troops from Lebanon in June 1985.
   The zone is patrolled by about 2,000 Lebanese militiamen trained
and financed by Israel. Foreign reports say about 1,000 Israeli
soldiers also are stationed in the zone.
   In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, accused
the Amal militia of violating a Syrian-sponsored no-kidnapping pact.
The accord was signed Friday by the two sides, the country's main
Shiite militias.
   A Hezbollah statement charged that Amal militiamen had kidnapped
four Hezbollah militiamen in south Beirut's Chiyah district Saturday
night. There was no comment from Amal.
   Amal, Arabic for hope, and Hezbollah have been locked in a bloody
struggle for dominance of Lebanon's 1 million Shiite Moslems, the
nation's largest single sect.

   Rebels fired three rockets into Kabul on Sunday,
the official Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   It did not say if there were any casualties.
   The Soviet Union announced Friday it was stopping the withdrawal
of more than 100,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan because of
increased attacks on government positions by Moslem rebels.
   The Soviet troops, which entered Afghanistan in 1979 to support
the Marxist government, are scheduled to withdraw by Feb. 15 under a
U.N.-mediated agreement signed in Geneva.
   Soviet officials said they are still committed to meeting that
deadline. In keeping with the agreement, about half the 100,000 Red
Army troops that were deployed in Afghanistan have been pulled out.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leaders on Sunday threatened
broad protests, including strikes, if the government does not
reverse its decision to close the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk.
   The statement was the strongest yet by the banned trade union
movement on the planned closing of the yard, where Solidarity began.
   Solidarity, which in August helped end Poland's worst wave of
strikes in seven years, now appears to be on a collision course with
the communist government.
   The government announced Oct. 31 that it will close the yard in
December because the business is losing money.
   But Solidarity's national executive commission, led by Lech
Walesa, said in a statement, ``There is no actual economic
justification of this decision.''
   ``The Gdansk shipyard has to be defended,'' Solidarity said. ``In
this situation we consider it necessary to conduct a broad action in
November for the legalization of Solidarity, in defense of the
Gdansk shipyard and the repressed participants in strikes _ even
resorting to strike action.''
   Solidarity national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said the
union's plans might be clearer after a workers' rally scheduled
Tuesday in Gdansk.
   A Walesa aide, Piotr Konopka, quoted Walesa as telling worshipers
at St. Brygida's Church in Gdansk that he would call the a national
``strike alert'' at the rally.
   A ``strike alert'' would mean organizing strike committees and
getting workers prepared to strike at any moment unless their
demands are met, said Solidarity spokesman Wojciech Maziarski.
   The Solidarity statement said the decision to close the
10,000-worker yard is a ``dangerous political act, pointing out the
fact that the government of Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski takes
advantage of extraordinary powers to sustain Stalinist methods of
administering the economy.''
   It is ``an act of revenge against Solidarity and the Gdansk
shipyard,'' the statement said.
   While acknowledging that economic reform, which Solidarity
supports, may force the closing of some enterprises, the statement
said the closings should not be ``arbitrary political decisions.''
   It said any closures should be preceded by a review of economic
performance, with workers and their representatives taking part.
   ``What should be the first step is the publication of a list of
threatened enterprises, and calling upon the employees of these
enterprises to undertake attempts at improving the situation,'' it
said.
   Walesa issued a statement Saturday refusing to meet with Interior
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak to discuss plans for wide-ranging economic
talks with authorities until the shipyard decision was suspended and
the government rehired all workers fired for taking part in the
August strikes.
   Walesa ended the last of the August walkouts after Gen. Kiszczak
promised that the talks could include the subject of Solidarity's
future.
   But the government has since insisted that Solidarity first drop
two alleged extremists from its delegation to the talks.
   That condition, the decision to close the shipyard and the
failure to rehire at least 100 workers fired for the August strikes
has convinced Solidarity leaders that the government is no longer
interested in talks.
   Solidarity was the Soviet bloc's only independent labor movement
until it was crushed by security forces in 1981 and outlawed in 1982.

   A powerful earthquake Sunday night shook a
sparsely populated mountain region of southern China near the Burma
border, and communications were cut with the stricken area,
officials in Beijing said.
   At about the same time, a smaller quake was reported in northern
Thailand near the Burmese border. The quake caused minor damage to
buildings and swayed high-rise buildings hundreds of miles to the
south, in Bangkok.
   In the ``Skylounge'' restaurant on the top floor of Bangkok's
43-story Baiyoke Tower, the city's tallest building, hundreds of
panicked patrons fled without paying their bills.
   On Saturday another strong quake, measuring 7 on the Richter
scale, jolted an uninhabited mountain range in northern Tibet and
Qinghai province in far western China.
   No casualties were reported in any of the earthquakes.
   The temblor in southern China on Sunday night was centered in
Yunnan province's Lancang County, home to the Lahu minority group,
and measured 7.6 on the Richter scale in China. The U.S. Geological
Survey measured it at 7.4.
   Chen Yong, deputy director of the State Seismology Bureau in
Beijing, said there was probably some damage in sparsely populated
Lancang County, but ``we have no reports.'' He said telephone lines
between villages in the county and Kunming, capital of Yunnan, were
cut by the quake.
   The temblor was felt in Kunming, a city of 1.5 million people 240
miles to the northeast, but caused no damage there, he said.
   The Thailand quake measured 5 on the Richter scale and was
centered in northern Chiang Mai province near the Burma border. It
shattered windows in some buildings in nearby Chiang Rai city,
authorities said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   A quake measuring 7 is capable of causing widespread, heavy
damage in a populated area, while one measuring 8 on the scale is 10
times as strong and is capable of tremendous damage.
   Mild earthquakes occur frequently in both areas of China hit by
the weekend quakes, but the intensity of these was unusual,
seismological officials said.

   Human howls fill the night in the woods
of New England, where hunters and naturalists are on the prowl for
the coyote, which is rapidly replacing man and dog as the chief
predator of deer.
   In recent years, the rarely seen coyote has grown in such numbers
that Massachusetts has started a hunting season and Maine hunters
are worried there soon may be more coyotes than deer. Sheep farmers
in Maine say the animal is driving some out of business.
   But conservationists say reports of coyote kills are exaggerated
and that the animal is doing some good.
   ``When you look at the vast majority of coyotes in the state,
they are providing a degree of balance and diversity in the wildlife
community and in the ecosystem,'' said Paul Lyons, a wildlife
biologist for Massachusetts' Metropolitan District Commission. ``The
more diverse the community, the better it is for everybody.''
   Lyons is one of the naturalists who howl at night in the huge
Quabbin Reservoir in western Massachusetts. The naturalists hope the
animal will howl back. From the howls, they say they can learn where
the animals hunt and live.
   One thing the naturalists have learned is the coyotes have driven
domestic dogs from the reservoir. The dogs had been a predator of
the deer.
   Massachusetts has an estimated 1,000 coyotes; Maine has at least
16,000, officials said.
   The coyote is among the most intelligent of wild animals, say
those who track it. Related to the wolf, the eastern coyote is the
size of a small German shepherd with a fox-like head, bushy tail and
gray-black coat. It averages four feet long from nose to tail tip
and weighs about 40 pounds.
   The western coyote migrated east in the 1930s, breeding with the
Algonquin wolf along the way and evolving into a larger species.
   Since 1980, Massachusetts officials have confirmed 28 coyote
attacks on lambs and other small livestock. All but three of the 75
deer carcasses found last winter at the Quabbin reservoir were
killed by coyotes, naturalists said.
   Massachusetts started coyote hunting in 1981 after a handful of
farmers claimed coyotes had killed newborn calves. Since then,
hunters have killed 20 to 40 coyotes yearly in Massachusetts,
officials said.
   The Massachusetts Audubon Society opposed coyote hunting, saying
there was insufficient evidence the animals seriously threatened
ecological stability. A coyote protection bill failed in the
Legislature in 1981, and the farmers prevailed.
   Richard Turner, southwestern wildlife district game manager for
Massachusetts, said coyotes may even be a help, since they eat
animals killed by cars or other causes and keep such pests as
rabbits and field mice under control.
   Maine hunters and sheep farmers, however, call them a menace.
Unofficial estimates of the number of Maine deer killed by coyotes
range from 3,000 to 15,000 yearly. Officials have no estimates on
sheep killed.
   Maine has never banned coyote hunting, and officials said at
least 1,600 coyotes are killed by hunters and farmers annually.
   One pro-hunting group, the Maine Coyote Control Association, has
offered a $25 reward for each dead coyote during hunting season,
which runs most of the winter.
   ``I'd poison them if I could,'' said Connie Skov, a Maine sheep
farmer who said has lost nearly a dozen sheep to coyotes. ``They are
just no good.''
   She said coyote attacks have helped drive eight small sheep farms
out of business in Waldoboro, 80 miles north of Portland.
   But Henry Hilton, animal damage control adminstrator for Maine,
said there are ways to stop the sheep kills.
   ``A lot of farmers will attest to the fact that if you use a
minimum amount of sound husbandry, it's just not a problem,'' he
said.
   Hilton said coyotes don't have much of an impact on the deer
herd. Since 1986, he said, the herd has been increasing because of
bans on hunting doe and other regulations.
   Coyote hunting continues simply because the animal is far from an
endangered species, he said. ``If there is no reason to protect them
from harvest, that leaves them open to be harvested,'' Hilton said.

<HEAD>Experts Say Painting In Cairo Genuine Van Gogh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A painting of vivid yellow and orange flowers
in a dark vase, hanging on a faded wall of a little-known museum on
the Nile, is an original work by Vincent van Gogh, French experts
say.
   ``It is real, absolutely real, without doubt,'' Francoise Cachin,
director of Paris' Musee d'Orsay, told a news conference Saturday.
   The one-foot-square canvas is among 350 paintings and other art
works at the Mohammed Mahmoud Khalil Museum, which houses the
private collection of an Egyptian senator donated to the state by
his widow in 1960.
   The painting attributed to van Gogh, titled ``Poppies'' by the
museum, is being called ``Flowers'' by the French experts until ``we
can determine exactly what kind of flowers are in the vase,'' said
Cachin.
   In 1967, Egyptian authorities estimated its value at $500,000,
but Cachin didn't give any estimate of how much it might be worth
today.
   A van Gogh painting has commanded the single highest price ever
paid for a painting _ his ``Irises'' sold for almost $53.9 million
in New York in November 1987. Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' was sold at
Christie's in London in March 1987 for $39.85 million.
   The authenticity of the Cairo painting has been questioned since
it was stolen in 1978 from the domed, arabesque building on an
island on the Nile opposite downtown Cairo. The painting was
recovered at an undisclosed location in Kuwait in 1980.
   ``It is an authenic van Gogh,'' said the curator of the museum's
paintings, Genevieve Lacambre.
   Lacambre, who was curator of 19th-century painting at the Louvre
in Paris for 20 years, studied the canvas attributed to the Dutch
master for three weeks before the results were announced.
   Cachin said the painting resembles a flower scene painted by the
French artist Adolphe Monticelli, whose work deeply affected the
young van Gogh. The Monticelli painting also is part of the Khalil
collection.
   ``It is absolutely correct for the technique of early Van Gogh,''
Cachin said.
   She said the back of the painting has a small, numbered pink
label, ``the kind used by French art dealers.
   ``It would be impossible to imagine someone could copy such a
number,'' said Cachin, who also studied a photograph from the Paris
dealer who sold the painting to Khalil.
   Most of the canvases for which the Dutch-born postimpressionist
is remembered were painted in 29 months of frenzied activity before
his suicide in 1890 at age 37.
   The experts said they believed the Cairo canvas was painted
around 1887.
   Cachin said the painting is in ``a normal condition for a
painting that has been stolen.'' Bernard Malauzat, French Embassy
cultural officer, said the oil had ``small flakes of paint missing.''
   The painting has been ``in some small accident which seems to be
recent, maybe when it was traveling,'' Cachin said. ``It can easily
be restored.''
   The painting has been taken off display and put in storage at the
nearby el-Gezira Museum.
   Authorities have never fully revealed the details of the theft of
the painting. When it was recovered in March 1980, Egypt's
then-interior minister, Nabawi Ismail, said three Egyptians involved
in the theft had been arrested and informed police where the canvas
was left. Authorities never reported whether the thieves were
charged or tried.
   Other works in he Khalil collection, all from the 19th-century
French school, are by Paul Gauguin, Gustave Courbet, Francois
Millet, Claude Monet, Edouard Manet, Auguste Renoir and Auguste
Rodin.
   Malauzat said 90 percent of the the museum's 745 art works _
including 270 sculptures and more than 100 other works _ have been
authenticated.
   ``The majority of paintings are not in bad condition. With proper
expertise and cleaning, they will be back to very bright colors,''
Malauzat said.

   More than 50 percent of the Japanese favor a
28-year-old treaty under which the United States maintains military
bases in Japan and pledges to help defend the nation, according to a
poll published Sunday.
   The poll, described in the mass-circulation newspaper Ashai
Shimbun, said 53 percent of those surveyed approved the U.S.-Japan
Security treaty, 18 percent said it does not help Japan, 18 percent
said it is neither helpful nor unhelpful, and the remaining 11
percent did not answer the question.
   Asahi polled 3,000 people at random across the nation on Oct. 26
and 27. No margin of error was provided.
   Under the treaty, the United States operates military bases in
Japan and is obligated to assist in Japan's defense. Japan in return
provides land for the U.S. bases. Japan's 1947 Constitution forbids
it to have an army or wage war, but the nation maintains small
``defense forces'' for protection.

<TEXT>
   A Titan 34D rocket
thundered into space Sunday, carrying a classified payload an expert
said was probably a pair of military communications satellites.
   The powerful 16-story-tall booster blasted off under heavy cloud
cover from Space Launch Complex 4 about 10:03 a.m, said Capt. John
Sullivan, a spokesman at Vandenberg, about 140 miles northwest of
Los Angeles.
   As usual for military space flights, the Air Force didn't
announce the launch in advance and did not identify the payload to
be put into orbit.
   The Titan 34D probably carried two Satellite Data System
satellites, said John Pike, a space policy expert for the
Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. He said it also
could have carried either a KH-9 or KH-11 photoreconnaissance spy
satellite.
   Pike, who knew of the launch in advance, said Friday the SDS
satellites are used for military communications, especially in the
event the United States had to launch a nuclear attack.
   The Titan 34D is America's most powerful space booster, although
it soon will be replaced by the Titan 4, which is due for its maiden
launch next year from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   Sunday's rocket was the last Titan 34D that will be launched from
Vandenberg. Two more are scheduled for launch from Cape Canaveral
early next year.
   The last launch of a Titan 34D was from Florida on Sept. 2, but
sources told The Associated Press it failed to orbit its payload
because the rocket's third stage failed to reignite.
   Titan 34Ds were grounded for 18 months following two successive
explosions during launches from Vandenberg in 1985 and 1986.

   Experts are baffled by something that is causing
dozens of children in a Ukrainian town to go bald.
   Residents are beginning to panic, the newspaper Socialist
Industry reported Sunday. Soviet media say at least 82 children have
been affected. The reports say the children have suffered no other
unusual effects.
   The town, Chernovtsy, is near the Romanian border, far from the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the areas downwind of it that
suffered from radiation contamination after a 1986 accident.
   ``Nothing like this has happened before in the medical practice
in our country,'' Socialist Industry quoted Ukrainian deputy health
minister Anatoly Kasyanenko as saying.
   Health officials said they have found no environmental dangers
around Chernovtsy that might be responsible.

   Mayor John Teusink and his wife Cam
are divided over who should be elected president, and so is the
front yard of their home.
   Their yard is split down the middle into ``his'' and ``her''
halves. His side, on the right, is planted with a ``Bush-Quayle''
sign. Her lefthand side bears a ``Dukakis-Bentsen'' sign.
   ``We have about three or four lively discussions a day, and we're
still married,'' said longtime Republican John Teusink, 48, a
biology professor at Aquinas College and a City Council member in
this community north of Grand Rapids.
   Cam Teusink, 47, a secretary and member of the city Planning
Commission, said she abandoned her traditional GOP loyalties this
year.
   ``I decided I was fed up with the Republicans and I was going to
vote Democratic this year,'' she said. ``And I wanted it to be known
that I was going to vote Democratic.''
   She said she knows Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis is the underdog, ``but I have a weak spot for the underdog.''
   ``What you tend to be is gullible,'' retorted her husband, a
staunch supporter of Republican nominee George Bush.
   That kind of talk could cost John Teusink at least one vote, even
though he's running unopposed for re-election to the City Council.
   ``There is some debate going about that,'' Cam Teusink said.
``I'll just have to watch him.''

<HEAD>Bayh on Bayh: Famous Father Assesses The Gubernatorial Candidate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG RICHARDSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On election night 1962, a young Democratic
candidate listened to returns on television in his hotel room while
his 6-year-old son sat on the floor drawing pictures.
   Now, 26 years later, the father plans to be at his son's side as
they watch the returns Tuesday that will determine if Evan Bayh will
become the next governor of Indiana and the first Democrat to hold
the office in 20 years.
   Bayh, 32, would also be the youngest U.S. governor in office
today.
   ``I'll feel the same way whether he wins or loses,'' said his
father, former three-term U.S. Sen. Birch E. Bayh. ``I love him. I'm
proud of him, and I don't think anyone could have done it any
better.''
   Evan Bayh, Indiana's secretary of state, held a 54-40 lead over
Republican Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz in an Indianapolis Star poll
published Oct. 30. The margin of error was 3.5 points. Gov. Robert
D. Orr is barred from a third straight term.
   The race in GOP vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle's home
state is being watched for the coattail effect of both the
Bush-Quayle ticket and U.S. Sen. Richard G. Lugar'a re-election bid.
   Eleven other states select governors on Tuesday: Delaware,
Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota,
Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia and Washington. Democrats
are favored to retake the governor's office in West Virginia and
Utah.
   The elder Bayh, who was unseated in the Senate by Quayle in 1980,
is legendary for his personal campaigning style and has been back on
the hustings in recent weeks to help his son and other candidates
across Indiana.
   Bayh's activity and the famous name he gave his son, Birch Evans
Bayh III, have prompted Republicans to complain that the Democratic
candidate for governor has an unseemly advantage.
   ``He inherited a good number of his father's friends,'' the elder
Bayh said, ``but he also inherited his father's enemies.'' He said
the famous name helped Evan Bayh get attention, but after that,
``he's done it all on his own.''
   ``It's very much like the rookie on a baseball team where the All
Star leftfielder breaks his arm crashing into the wall and so the
rookie gets to play,'' said the elder Bayh, now 60. ``Now those were
circumstances over which he had no control. He was lucky.
   ``But if he can't hit and he can't catch and he can't throw, he's
not going to last.''
   The younger Bayh in 1975-76 worked in his father's brief campaign
for the Democratic presidential nomination. As a law student, Evan
Bayh managed his father's unsuccessful Senate campaign against
Quayle.
   Birch Bayh said his son expressed an interest in a career in
public service in 1979.
   ``I told him to make sure you know what you want to do, putting
your family first, and think about financial security _ all the
kinds of advice I didn't take when I was his age,'' said Bayh, now a
lawyer in Washington.
   ``It wasn't daddy beating him over the back saying, `Here, you've
gotta do this. You've gotta do that,''' he said. ``It's really been
his idea.''
   Since entering politics, Evan Bayh ``has his own ideas, his own
campaign,'' his father said. The senior Bayh offers his guidance,
giving his son the benefit of his experience. ``But it's up to him

   Gerry Haukebo's family and friends have
groaned at his jokes for years, but Haukebo's going to get the last
laugh. Never mind that he had to go all the way to China to get it.
   Haukebo's first book of jokes, titled ``American English Joke
Book,'' will be published there in April.
   The first printing calls for 50,000 to 100,000 copies, and the
publisher, Tianjin University, has asked Haukebo to compile a second
volume of American jokes.
   ``I'm finally getting some respect,'' the vice president of
public affairs and director of international programs at Moorhead
State University, said Friday.
   Haukebo's book, with an accompanying tape, includes 37 stale
tales that have been circulating in Moorhead for years.
   Like the one about a hog farmer who bought 10 pigs for $20 each
and sold the lot a year later for $20. Asked if that was good
business, the farmer said, ``Of course. I had their companionship
for a whole year.''
   ``I might get run out of town for telling that story here,'' said
Haukebo, 60. ``But in China it's very new.''
   The book will be used by Chinese students to learn how to read
and speak English. The idea came up after Haukebo visited China last
fall to help develop a faculty and student exchange program with
Tianjin University.

   A Japanese department store is selling
American real estate that can be put on a credit card and is hoping
consumers won't buy a home without it.
   Shoppers can glimpse property in California and Hawaii on a
videotape and use the credit card to put the transaction into
escrow. The deal was made possible by an arrangement between a Tokyo
subsidiary of Citicorp, the San Francisco firm of Grubb & Ellis and
the Tokyu Nihonbashi department store.
   Qualified Japanese home buyers can obtain an initial credit line
of $500,000.
   The Los Angeles Times reports in its Sunday editions that seven
similar centers are expected top open in Japan over the next six
months, and the program will be expanded to include property offered
in other states.

   Gospel music queen Sandi Patti says
family comes first and she even arranged her current tour so that
she could take her oldest daughter to her first day of kindergarten.
   Miss Patti, who has been voted top female vocalist at the Dove
Awards since 1982, says her role as mother is more important than
playing concerts or making albums.
   During a recent interview, Miss Patti said her 4-year-old
daughter, Anna, and 1-year-old twins, Jonathan and Jennifer, travel
with her when she tours with husband and manager John Helvering.
   ``It's rare that I don't take my own kids to the doctor. And we
arranged the fall tour so that I was able to take Anna to her first
day of school.
   ``Things like that are important. We want our kids to know that
they are a priority to us. It takes a lot of juggling, and plans can
change from one minute to the next. But they're worth scheduling
around,'' Miss Patti said.
   The Grammy award winner said she often eschews post-concert
appearances to put her children to bed.
   ``I just want my face to the last face they see at night and the
first they see in the morning.''

   Once wasn't enough for Oakland Athletics right
fielder Jose Canseco. He recited his marriage vows twice in two
weeks.
   Canseco, 24, won a $10,000 bet with teammate Dave Stewart by
getting married before Nov. 5. He married Esther Haddad, 21, of
Miami in a civil ceremony Oct. 25. About 350 guests watched the
couple repeat their vows during Roman Catholic ceremony on Saturday.
   The Cansecos were dressed in peach and white for the 20-minute
ceremony, said Lana Wiswell, director of sales for the site of the
wedding and reception in Kendall, a Miami suburb. Ms. Wiswell didn't
know if Stewart or any of the other Athletics attended the second
wedding.
   Their civil wedding took place in a courtroom in Coral Gables
five days after the Athletics were beaten in the World Series by the
Los Angeles Dodgers.

   Country music favorites Roy Acuff and Doc
Watson have rejoined the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band for a remake of
their acclaimed 1972 album ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken.''
   ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken 2'' will also feature new country
artists, said Dirt Band spokesman Mark Bliesener. Many of the new
artists haven't been confirmed, but he mentioned such performers as
Lyle Lovett and Bonnie Raitt.
   ``We weren't going to announce any of this until Dec. 5. We're
still talking to a lot of different artists,'' Bliesener said.
   Planning, rehearsal and recording sessions for the new album will
be taped for a television special and a tour is in the works,
Bliesener said.
   The original three-disc album sparked interest in traditional
music among non-country fans and reacquainted audiences with the
work of such notables as Maybelle Carter, Merle Travis, Earl Scruggs
and Jimmy Martin.

   Campaign workers on their way to a
political function with a candidate for sheriff shot and killed a
gunman in a convenience store parking lot, authorities said Sunday.
   Three shots were fired at a man reportedly waving a gun at
another man, said Polk County sheriff's spokeswoman Lynne
Breidenbach. Mauro DelGado, 31, was pronounced dead at the scene.
   Seven or eight campaign workers were riding in a motor home that
stopped at the A & D Store Saturday afternoon on the way to a
political function for candidate Tom Wheeler, Ms. Breidenbach said.
The altercation was developing as they drove up.
   Jim Blake and Joe Miano fired three shots at DelGado. Blake, a
former deputy, was armed with a 9mm automatic pistol, and Miano
carried a derringer, Ms. Breidenbach said. She was unsure whether
all three shots struck DelGado.
   Authorities later determined that DelGado fired his weapon into
the ground before he was shot.
   ``They tried to prevent a killing and one happened I guess,''
said sheriff's Col. Don McDaniel.
   No charges have been filed. The state attorney's office is
investigating the shooting and investigators also were checking to
see if Blake and Miano had weapons permits.
   Wheeler, a Democrat and former Winter Haven police chief, is
challenging Republican incumbent Lawrence W. Crow Jr. Neither could
be reached for comment Sunday. Spokesmen in the sheriff's office
said Crow was not in and that they could not relay a message. There
was no home or campaign telephone number listed for Wheeler.

<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police shut down a business called the
``Only Nude Car Wash in the Nation,'' advising the owner that hiring
naked women to scrub cars is against the law.
   Five women _ nude dancers turned car buffers _ and three male
nightclub employees were cited when police put an end to the weekly
event in a carport adjoining the Fantasy World club, assistant
manager Rodney Bickel said Sunday.
   The manager, a weightlifter whose stage name is ``The Mad Dog,''
was also arrested on a felony charge of resisting arrest with
violence. Bickel denied the charge against manager Jim Mercer,
saying police used ``brutal force'' against Mercer in the Saturday
raid of the adults-only club.
   Mercer was taken to University Hospital for observation after
complaining of shoulder injuries, was returned to jail and posted
bond Sunday, Bickel said.
   The club's marquee boasts the car wash's singular status.
   ``We have girls that wash cars in the nude. They are in an
enclosed area. We have a screened off drive-through area that is
part of the building. Don't think that they are visible,'' Bickel
said. ``There's blue tarp all the way around.''
   Police wanted to close the $10-per wash operation when it opened
in mid-September but waited for word from the state attorney's
office that the arrests were legal.
   ``It should have been closed down the first week,'' said vice
Detective Bobby Deal. ``Once they started the car wash, the state
attorney had to research whether it was a violation of the law.''
   The state attorney's office gave police the go-ahead on the
premise that operating the car wash constituted a breach of the
peace and violation of public nudity laws, Deal said.
   ``Needless to say, there is not a statute that says Jacksonville
shall not have nude car washes,'' said Audrey Moran, deputy director
of the state attorney's county court division. ``But the case law on
public nudity and breach of peace support it.''
   Mrs. Moran said attorneys hadn't heard of any other nude car
washes, but they knew of a doughnut shop staffed by topless
employees in Fort Lauderdale.
   Fantasy World owner Warren Colazzo started the car wash as part
of his protest against a year-old city law banning topless dancing
at businesses that sell alcohol.
   The nude dancers were charged with breach of the peace and public
nudity, and the men were charged with breach of the peace and aiding
in public nudity. All are misdemeanors.
   ``Needless to say, our car wash has been closed until this case
is settled in court,'' Bickel said.

<HEAD>Cowen Owen Freed To Serve Trafficking Sentence In U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AMILCAR DE LEON</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American convicted of cocaine
smuggling in a case that attracted the attention of the U.S.
attorney general left prison Sunday under a deal that allows him to
serve his sentence in the United States.
   Conan Owen, 24, a photographer and a former summer intern in Vice
President George Bush's office, left Carcel Modelo in handcuffs and
under police escort. He had been held there since his arrest March
13, 1987 at Barcelona's El Prat airport.
   As he walked through the prison patio to a waiting police van,
Owen raised his hands defiantly to show he was handcuffed.
   Owen was taken to the Barcelona police headquarters, according to
the officer in charge, who demanded anonymity. It was believed Owen
would spend the night there and be turned over to U.S. marshals
Monday in time to catch a flight to New York.
   Owen was convicted in April of drug trafficking and sentenced to
six years and a day.
   At his March 26 trial, Owen testified he was tricked into
carrying a suitcase from Santiago, Chile, to Barcelona in which
customs police found four pounds of cocaine. He said the people who
had given him a free-lance photo assignment sent him to Barcelona
after a few days work in Santiago.
   Jorge Barahona, who gave Owen the assignment, later told U.S.
officials he and others placed the cocaine in the suitcase without
Owen's knowledge. Barahona provided that information to U.S.
officials in return for a suspended sentence and a promise he would
not be turned over to Spanish authorities.
   The Barcelona court refused to admit Barahona's deposition as
evidence in Owen's trial because plea-bargaining is illegal in Spain.
   Owen's transfer to the United States is allowed under an
international treaty Spain and the United States signed in 1983. To
become eligible for return, Owen had to drop his appeal of the
trafficking conviction.
   The prosecutor also dropped an appeal calling for an additional
conviction on contraband charges which the three-judge Barcelona
court threw out.
   Owen's attorney and the photographer's family in Annandale, Va.,
have refused to discuss the case with reporters.
   The Spanish news media have questioned the degree of U.S.
interference in the country's legal system after the personal appeal
for Owen's release by then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III. Citing
Owen's ties to Meese and Bush, some newspapers claimed the
photographer was an American spy.
   During a weekly Cabinet meeting Oct. 28, the Spanish government
agreed to Owen's request to be transferred to the United States. In
February, a month before Owen's trial, Meese traveled to Madrid to
sign a supplementary extradtion treaty with Spanish Justice Minister
Fernando Ledesma.
   At the time Meese told reporters he was delivering a copy of
Barahona's deposition to Ledesma in the hopes that charges against
Owen would be dropped.
   After Owen's conviction, Meese said through a Justice Department
spokesman that he ``regrets very much this action by the Spanish
court....I think it's important to stress that we continue to
believe ... in Mr. Owen's innocence, and we continue to hope that he
will ultimately be exonerated.''
   According to the U.S. Embassy in Madrid, as of six months ago,
there were six Americans serving time in Spanish jails on
drug-related charges, and another nine, including Owen, who were
awaiting trial on drug charges.

   United States Information Agency officials
investigated the disappearance of several Voice of America tapes and
scripts intended for broadcast to two African nations but could not
determine who took them, according to a published report Sunday.
   The VOA carried a story on the matter during the weekend, but the
editor on duty Sunday in Washington, Herant Seropian, said the story
was based on a report in Sunday's New York Times and that no
additional comment was available from VOA officials.
   The Times quoted three VOA officials as saying they suspected
South African government agents, beginning in 1986 and continuing
recently, may have infiltrated the agency and taken material
intended for broadcast in Portuguese to Angola and Mozambique. South
Africa has supported guerrilla movements in the two former
Portuguese colonies.
   The Times reported that the agency dismissed an employee of its
Portuguese service after he was suspected of delivering tapes to the
South African Embassy in 1986. The man, Antonio Augusto da Silva
Vicente, a Portuguese citizen who now works for the South African
Broadcasting Corp. in Johannesburg, denied that he took the
material, the Times said.
   The report said tapes have continued to disappear beginning again
in April 1987.
   The report quoted VOA director Richard W. Carlson as saying, ``We
have no absolute proof that it was South Africa, but logic tells me
it was.''
   It also quotes Margaret O. Kennedy, Africa division deputy
director, and Gregory A. Pirio, chief of the Portuguese service, as
saying they suspected people working on behalf of South Africa took
the tapes and scripts.

   Here are excerpts from a speech
delivered Sunday by Republican presidential candidate George Bush:
   I brought with me this issue book because you know, we're limited
today to the sound bites.
   We're in the everything-kind-of-controlled no matter whether you
give a good speech or a lousy one ... Here it is on issues, 350
pages, the issues. And they're issues that are of concern to the
American people. And we've been talking about them in depth, on
foreign affairs or education or ethics or whatever it is. And
somehow I think the American people are awful smart. They don't need
three or four husky-voiced commentators to tell them what they know.
They know what they see. They study. ...
   America's prestige is on the move again. We're rolling up our
sleeves to work, not to have our pulse taken. ...
   I'm a sportsman, an outdoorsman. I go hunting every year
religiously, love fishing, love the parks and I am pledged to do a
better job on the environment of ours. I will push to clean up toxic
waste. I will stop ocean dumping. I will save the oceans and protect
and expand our beautiful parks. that is my commitment, that is my
heartbeat. ...
   We simply cannot go back to the policies of Jimmy Carter and
Walter Mondale and turn over the White House to the very same people
who claim to be on your side but who left America on its back. ...
   They don't want that leadership to be flashy. They want it to be
solid. They want it to be experienced. They want leadership that's
not going to make a lot of empty promises. ...
   As I near the end of this very long arduous journey, I think of
the larger issues that this election is really about. My thoughts
keep coming back to the most serous responsibility of a president,
and that is advancing freedom and protecting the national security
of the United States of America.
   Just yesterday the papers reported that the Soviet Union is _
hopefully temporarily _ but it's halting now their withdrawal from
Afghanistan.
   These events are a stark reminder that power remains a very
important part of world politics. To protect peace and advance the
cause of freedom, a president must have the experience to know when
and how to use power, the prudent use of power and be willing to do
so when he has to do that. And the new president of the United
States, believe me will be tested on all fronts. Afghanistan will
only be one. Mr. Gorbachev's twists and turns present a great
opportunity.
   And yes, there's hope as he wrestles now with glasnost, the
openness, and peristroika, the reform. It's a challenging time to
lead the United States of America.

<TEXT>
   West Germans began a solemn
remembrance Sunday of the Nazi Kristallnacht, the brutal night of
terror a half-century ago that led to the Holocaust.
   Residents of this picturesque town north of Frankfurt placed a
wreath at the site where the synagogue was burned down Nov. 10, 1938.
   Over the next few days, hundreds of local gatherings, panel
discussions and expositions will be held throughout West Germany.
The major national day of observance takes place in Frankfurt on
Wednesday, 50 years to the day after the pogrom began.
   In Austria, Jewish leaders and city officials unveiled five
plaques to commemorate the destruction of 49 Vienna synagogues by
Nazi terror squads.
   East Germans for weeks have been staging Kristallnacht
ceremonies, emphasizing how Communists and Jews were persecuted by
the Nazis.
   Peter Kirchner, the head of East Berlin's tiny Jewish community,
said his nation appears to be learning more from the lessons of the
past than West Germany.
   ``In the GDR (East Germany), there's a greater cracking down on
neo-fascist ways of thought than in the Federal Republic (West
Germany), where meetings of former Nazis can take place under police
protection,'' Kirchner said on West Germany's Deutschlandfunk radio.
   The terror began the night of Nov. 9, 1938, when Nazi thugs
burned synagogues, destroyed Jewish businesses and beat up Jews.
   The Nazis dubbed the night Kristallnacht _ or ``Crystal Night'' _
because of shards of broken glass that filled the streets.
   Josef Foschepoth, general secretary of West Germany's Societies
for Christian-Jewish cooperation, said the Kristallnacht marked
``the start of a new phase, the phase of the physical annihilation
of the Jews.''
   Historians agree the Kristallnacht was the first major step in
the systematic Nazi campaign to annihilate European Jews.
   The Nazis murdered an estimated 6 million Jews and hundreds of
thousands of other opponents during their 1933-1945 rule.
   ``Throughout the entire Reich that night, 91 Jews met their death
under the sticks, boots and bullets of the death squads of the Nazi
movement,'' Foschepoth told 125 people in Koenigstein.
   At least 195 synagogues and about 7,500 Jewish businesses were
either destroyed or badly damaged.
   ``How was this all possible?'' Foschepoth asked. ``We can't get
away from this continuing question.''
   The extent of the ceremonies in the next few days, reaching into
even the smallest communities, may be unprecedented in a country
filled with public reminders of Nazi terror.
   Heinz Galinski, the head of West Germany's Jewish community and a
survivor of the Auschwitz death camp, has been at the center of a
controversy over whether he should address Parliament at its
ceremony Thursday.
   ``It would have looked good for the reputation of West Germany if
one of those directly affected ... had been given the opportunity to
say a public word from such a podium on that day, especially because
of the significance of that day,'' Galinski said last week.
   He has not been invited.
   About 32,000 Jews now live in West Germany, while the number of
practicing Jews in East Germany is estimated to be 450 to 600.
   Along with solemn ceremonies, there will also be reminders that
times have changed. In the city of Darmstadt, a 45-minute drive
south of Frankfurt, a new synagogue will be dedicated Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   In a million-dollar, nationwide appeal hours
before the polls open Election Day, Democrat presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis will urge Americans to ``look in the mirror'' and
ask themselves, ``Is George Bush on your side?''
   The Dukakis campaign bought 30 minutes beginning at 8 p.m. EST
Monday on the ABC, CBS and NBC television networks to broadcast a
program in which the Massachusetts governor will answer questions
posed by people in various regions of the country.
   A partial transcript of the program was made public Sunday.
   Republican nominee George Bush's campaign has purchased 30
minutes on the same three networks beginning at 8:30 p.m. EST on
election eve.
   ``People are starving in Louisiana,'' Sherry Hill of Hammond,
La., says on the program. ``People are losing their home, they are
six months late in their bills. People can't buy homes because they
don't have any jobs ... don't have any money.''
   ``People starving in this country?'' responded Dukakis. ``Their
houses being foreclosed on because there are no jobs down there?
   ``Isn't the responsibility of the next president of the United
States to go to work and invest for the people of Louisiana and
bring business and labor and the educational community together?''
   Asked by Kenneth Crapsey of Golden, Colo., what he would do to
help farmers, Dukakis replied, ``I think the family farm is a very
precious institution in this country and I know that working with
our family farmers, we can get them a fair price for our crops.''
   In an excerpt from his standard stump speech, the Democratic
candidate said the only new idea proposed by Bush was ``a new $40
billion, five-year capital gains giveaway for the very rich.''
   Dukakis added: ``Now who is going to pay for that tax break? Look
beside you. Look behind you. Look in the mirror and ask yourself _
Is George Bush on your side?''
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen appears on the
program to criticize Bush commercials.
   The Texas senator said voters were ``deeply concerned about Dan
Quayle (the Republican vice presidential nominee) and as this
Election Day gets closer they're disturbed with the idea that if
Bush were to win he would be a heartbeat away from the presidency.''

   Armed Sri Lankan mercenaries ended a two-day high seas standoff
early Sunday after the Indian frigate Godavari fired on the cargo
vessel 60 miles from the Sri Lankan coast, Indian officials said.
   They said the alleged mastermind of Thursday's bloody coup
attempt, an aide to former Maldivian President Ibrahim Nasir, was
among the 46 people who surrendered. Nasir has denied involvement in
the coup.
   A Maldivian spokesman, Maj. Zahir, said about 100 people
suspected of sympathizing with the coup had been rounded up for
questioning, most Maldivian citizens. The nationalities of the
others were uncertain, but they spoke the Tamil language of the
mercenaries, said Zahir, who uses only one name. Some Tamil-speakers
from South Asia come to Sri Lanka to work.
   The Indian marine commandos recovered the bodies of four hostages
from the Maldivian-registered ship, Indian government spokesman
Ramamohan Rao said in New Delhi. Rao said he did not know how the
hostages died.
   Interviews with survivors indicated three other hostages were
missing, he said.
   Seven of the surviving hostages, including Transport Minister
Ahmed Mujithaba, had bullet wounds and were flown to the south
Indian port city of Trivandrum for treatment, Rao said.
   Zahir said he had not been informed of any hostage deaths.
   Rao said the Indian navy was returning the alleged mastermind _
Maldivian businessman Abdullah Luthufi _ and the captured
mercenaries to the 2,000-island nation. President Maumoon Abdul
Gayoom said they would be put on trial.
   Luthufi was a former aide to Nasir, whose followers also tried to
overthrow Gayoom in 1980 and 1983.
   Asked what punishment they would receive if convicted, Gayoom
told a news conference: ``I can't tell you at this time, but we do
have capital punishment.''
   The president, who looked relaxed and cheerful, said authorities
granted no concessions to the mercenaries for their surrender.
   The Maldives' foreign minister, Fathulla Jameel, said that
Luthufi hired the mercenaries and came ashore with them Thursday.
   Jameel said earlier that Luthufi was seen giving orders and
brandishing a pistol during the fighting. Jameel said Luthufi had
entered the presidential palace and ``sat on the president's desk
just to assert he had taken over the country.''
   Gayoom, 50, was elected president in 1978 after Nasir abruptly
resigned and fled to Singapore where he still lives. The 62-year-old
ex-president has been accused by the Maldivian government of
misappropriating $4.2 million in state funds during his 10-year rule.
   Two Indian frigates had trailed the mercenaries for two days as
their listing ship limped across the Indian Ocean toward Sri Lanka,
about 475 miles northeast of Maldives, also known as the Maldive
Islands.
   The mercenaries fled Male early Friday, shortly after Indian
paratroopers landed in Maldives to help Gayoom and his lightly
armed, 1,200-member security forces.
   Maldivian and Indian officials said most of the estimated 150
mercenaries escaped by sea. Indian naval ships have searched area
waters and islands for them.
   According to Jameel, the foreign minister, the official casualty
toll from Thursday's fighting was 14 dead and 40 wounded. He said
eight Maldivian security men, three mercenaries and three civilians
were killed.
   Several Indian and Maldivian officials earlier put the death toll
at about 20 or 30.
   Jameel said the mercenaries were members of a Sri Lankan militant
group, the People's Liberation Front of Tamils.
   The Tamil separatist group is one of several fighting the
Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lankan government.

   At least 153 prisoners escaped through
a tunnel from a military detention camp in southern Sri Lanka before
dawn Sunday, but 78 were captured, officials said.
   Almost all the prisoners had been detained on suspicion of
belonging to the People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese radical
group blamed by authorities for more than 500 killings in the last
15 months.
   Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the prisoners
dug a tunnel at the Pelawatta camp, about 45 miles southeast of
Colombo.
   Police and soldiers captured 78 of the escapees, the government's
information department said. It gave no details but said searches
were under way for the others.
   The front has vowed to kill anyone who supports the
Sinhalese-dominated government's peace accord for ending a
separatist war by Tamil guerrillas. The front said the accord, which
was signed July 30, 1987, makes too many concessions to the Tamil
ethnic minority.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is planning a memorial at the
Katyn Forest where thousands of Polish army officers were murdered
during World War II, the newspaper Izvestia reported Sunday.
   The memorial was approved by the Soviet Council of Ministers,
Izvestia said. It gave no dates for construction.
   The newspaper said it will be the first monument for prisoners of
war in the Soviet Union, which has thousands of monuments to its own
heroes of World War II.
   The existence of the Katyn Forest grave was announced by the
German government in 1943. It said it had found a mass grave of
4,250 Polish officers near Katyn.
   Katyn is 12 miles west of Smolensk in western Russia.
   The Soviets said in 1944 the officers were slain by the Germans,
but a U.S. investigation accused the Soviets.
   The Culture Ministry official quoted in the article, V. Ananiev,
acknowledged that Western sources have accused Soviet secret police
of committing the massacre, while the Soviets have long blamed the
Nazis.
   ``I cannot be a judge in these debates,'' Ananiev said, ``but I
know that some time ago specialists were in Katyn, conducted
excavations there, and proved the Polish officers were shot with
German weapons.''
   Ananiev said he did not know how many were killed at Katyn.

<HEAD>Singer Apologizes Again For Benefit Concert; Police Boycott Called
Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Country singer Willie Nelson has
apologized again for a concert he performed in to benefit an Indian
later convicted of killing two FBI agents. As a result, police have
canceled a boycott of Nelson's concert here Thursday.
   Sgt. Harold Flammia, president of the San Antonio Police Officers
Association, two weeks ago asked officers not to work as security
officials at the concert because Nelson sang at a California benefit
for Leonard Peltier. The proceeds went toward Peltier's legal
defense.
   Nelson met earlier this year with the American Federation of
Police Officers and the Fraternal Order of the Police and issued a
blanket apology for the concert.
   But Flammia said Nelson never had specifically apologized in his
home state of Texas, explaining the state's umbrella police
organization, Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, is not
affiliated with the other groups.
   Nelson issued another apology Friday night from his home in
Austin.
   ``I deeply regret that so many police officers and police
organizations were offended by the Indian concert,'' he said. ``In
the future, I will certainly consider all aspects of any benefit
concert so as not to offend anyone. I have nothing but respect for
all lawmen and under no circumstances do I support cop killers.''

   Konstantin U. Chernenko has become the latest
ex-leader to lose an honor that was bestowed upon him after death.
   The Tass news agency said Sunday that government officials
rescinded a decision to name a passenger ship after Chernenko, who
preceded Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the Communist Party chief.
   Chernenko died March 11, 1985. Officials decided to name a
Polish-built ship capable of carrying 400 people and 150 cars after
him. The ship was commissioned in December 1986.
   Chernenko served as Soviet leader just 13 months, after the late
Yuri Andropov and just before Gorbachev. He had been a lackluster
Brezhnev lieutenant and his rise to the top was considered the Old
Guard's last attempt at retaining power.
   In the Soviet Union, many things have been named and renamed as
leaders _ most notably Josef Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev _ rise and
fall in esteem.
   In January, authorities stripped a city, town squares and a
Moscow neighborhood of the name of Brezhnev, the Soviet leader from
1964 to 1982. Gorbachev blames Brezhnev for a ``period of
stagnation'' in the Soviet economy, creation of a cumbersome
bureaucracy and public skepticism about the leadership.
   After Brezhnev died in 1982, a city of 460,000 called
Naberezhnyie Chelny was renamed for him, along with an atomic
icebreaker, a naval vessel, a passenger liner, an army tank
division, a metallurgical institute, a military academy, a nuclear
power plant, and a dam.
   Dozens of cities were named for Stalin and his lieutenants. But
they reverted back to their original names after the dictator's
death in 1953.
   Soviet history has only recently begun to acknowledge that Stalin
murdered millions of his own people.

   Television watchers of the 19th annual New York
City Marathon followed the step-by-step progress Sunday of the
leaders, but many spectators on the course scanned the thousands of
runners for a familar face.
   The winner in the field of 23,478 _ largest ever for a marathon _
was Steve Jones of Wales, who finished in 2 hours, 8 minutes and 20
seconds, only seven seconds off the course record. Grete Waitz of
Norway won the women's division for a record ninth time in 2:28:07.
   Marybeth Torpe was hoping another runner would run fast _ her
boyfriend Tony Giannelli.
   She and several others had staked out the corner table at a
restaurant on First Avenue to get a good view of the runners as they
romped off the Queensboro Bridge.
   Their hopes on seeing Giannelli depended on how fast the Yonkers
native ran. ``We have to leave this table by 12:30. The manager's
kicking us out,'' said one of Giannelli's friends, Pete Koogan.
   Torpe was eager for Giannelli to finish, too.
   ``I'm going to ask him to marry me today,'' she said, holding up
the rose she planned to give him.
   Crowds cheered for the those in the lead packs and the also-rans
on the warm, sunny autumn day.
   Lynne Avery, a sophomore at Morristown (N.J.) High School, waited
on First Avenue near 60th Street hoping to catch a glimpse of her
English teacher, Robert Paciorkowski. But she was not taking any
chances on missing him.
   ``Mr. Paciorkowski told us if he saw a television camera, he'd
wave to us,'' Avery said _ as she held a small portable television
in her hand.
   All along the marathon route, volunteers handed drinks to
runners, but Rick Fairlamb of Glen Rock, N.J., had prepared a
special elixir of carrot juice. He handed them out to the 50 or so
runners in the ``Natural Living'' running club who passed his table
at 61st Street and First Avenue.
   ``Last night I went into Brooklyn and got 500 pounds of carrots
from a food co-op. We juiced them starting at 5 this morning,'' he
said.
   In Central Park, Richard Borrego stood on the railing with a
bullhorn, waiting for his favorites in the race to pass. He didn't
have any trouble finding them.
   ``I'm cheering for Grete and Steve Jones,'' Mr. Borrego said,
referring to the winners.
   ``They're both so courteous, full of good sportsmanship. They
always help other runners. They never knock other runners,'' Borrego
said. ``And that's the way it should be.''
   In Washington, D.C., more than 13,000 people from 23 countries
and 49 states ran the Marine Corps Marathon, which offers no prize
money and prides itself on being the ``people's race.''
   Jim Hage, a lawyer from Lanham, Md., who had never won a major
marathon, pulled away from two-time champion Brad Ingram in the last
half mile to win in 2:21:58.

   An unidentified spectator was arrested at a
George Bush campaign rally Sunday after witnesses said he dropped a
gun and fled, police said.
   ``We have a gun in custody, we have an individual in custody,''
said Lt. Thomas Lorenzen. ``Some witnesses saw him with the gun. He
dropped the gun and fled. We arrested him a half block away.''
   Sheila Tate, a spokeswoman for the Republican presidential
candidate, said the gun was a starter pistol, which fires blanks and
is used at sporting events. She said the suspect was standing within
50 yards of the vice president at the rally.
   Sgt. Jim Thompson of the Los Angeles Police Department said the
arrested man was in his 40s, was being questioned by investigators
and as of Sunday afternoon had not been charged with any offense.
   Business Week reporter Tim Smart, who saw the man being led away
in handcuffs, interviewed a witness, Henry Rodriguez, who said that
as Bush spoke to the outdoor crowd of several thousand people, a man
in the crowd reached into his waistband.
   Rodriguez was quoted as saying, ``I was standing next to the
individual. He had a card in front of him. He reached inside his
waistband, the gun dropped to the ground and I stepped on the gun.''
   Another witness, Louis Higgins, told Business Week he saw the man
standing immediately behind a police barricade at the rally.

<HEAD>Newspaper Column Calls College President a Nazi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HANOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A letter from the Dartmouth College trustees
deploring a student newspaper's comparison of the school's president
with Adolf Hitler will be sent to all students and faculty members,
a spokesman said Sunday.
   Chairman George Munroe wrote the letter Saturday to President
James Freedman saying the board of trustees is ``shocked and
outraged'' at the characterization by The Dartmouth Review, an
off-campus weekly not affiliated with the college.
   Munroe called it ``particularly offensive in light of your own
Jewish heritage.'' Without stopping ``free and even offensive
speech'' at the school, he said, the board has a right to speak out
against ``ignorance and moral blindness.''
   College spokesman Alex Huppe said Sunday the letter would be sent
to every student and faculty member on Monday.
   The letter was in reaction to an Oct. 19 column in the Review
headlined ``Ein Reich, Ein Volk, Ein Freedmann,'' a play on a Nazi
slogan, ``One Empire, One People, One Leader'' but substituting and
misspelling Freedman's name.
   Written by James Garrett, the column describes how ``Der
Freedmann'' and his associates rid the campus of conservatives. The
column refers to the ``Final Solution of the Conservative Problem''
and to survivors of the Dartmouth ``holocaust.'' Garrett described
Dartmouth friends and colleagues who were ``deported in cattle cars
in the night.''
   A drawing on the cover of the Oct. 26 issue depicted Freedman as
Hitler.
   Huppe said Freedman found the column ``distasteful and
unpleasant.''
   A full-page advertisement signed by four associate faculty deans
attacking the Review appeared last week in The Dartmouth, the
official daily student newspaper, as did a copy of a letter from 11
faculty members to The Review's outside advisers.
   ``The fact that President Freedman is Jewish raises the stakes in
a rather frightening way,'' the faculty members wrote, urging the
advisers to reconsider allowing their names to be associated with
the publication. ``The comparison of the Dartmouth president to
Hitler is so wildly inappropriate that one can only assume insidious
motives.''
   The Dartmouth also took issue with its off-campus competitor in
an editorial last week.
   ``The column is anti-Semitic; its impact rings through this
community today and will remain long after its publishers have
completed their stints in Hanover,'' The Dartmouth said.
   Harmeet Dhillon, editor in chief of the Review, said the column
wasn't anti-Semitic and that the point was misinterpreted.
   She said the paper sought to compare ``liberal fascism'' with
other forms of fascism and wasn't meant to trivialize the Holocaust.
Rather, the paper wanted to show how Freedman mistreated
conservative students by trying to ``get rid of people he doesn't
like.''
   ``We don't like him and we equated him with an anti-Semite,'' she
said. ``We don't see how that makes us anti-Semitic. ... It was
excessive. We admit that. We obviously didn't think anyone would
take it literally.''
   Dhillon said the Review had a tradition of support for Jews and
Israel and that Garrett had written a column a year ago condemning
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   She said Freedman's Jewish heritage didn't come up during
discussions to print the column.
   ``We've had a long war of words with President Freedman,'' she
said.
   In March, Freedman gave a speech denouncing Review reporters as
``ideological provocateurs posing as journalists'' who engage in
``malicious bullying tactics'' that threaten Dartmouth's commitment
to diversity.
   That same month, the college suspended three white Review
staffers for disrupting class and harassing a black professor. The
newspaper since has filed civil suits in state and federal courts
against the college, accusing it of reverse discrimination and
free-speech violations.

<TEXT>
   More than 800 Salvadoran war refugees
returned home Sunday after spending eight years in a camp in
Honduras and said they were happy but fearful and wanted only to
live and work in peace.
   Carrying their meager belongings, the refugees crossed the border
at El Poy, 60 miles north of San Salvador, in a convoy of 36 buses
and 89 trucks.
   Vehicle problems delayed their departure Saturday from the Mesa
Grande camp, 22 miles inside Honduras and 50 miles east of El Poy.
   ``We fear for our lives because the repression continues,'' said
a young man who gave his name only as Manuel. ``My idea is to work
the land and that they let us work in peace.''
   He said the refugees were returning ``to rebuild what the
Salvadoran army destroyed, and it even massacred many families,
friends and brothers in the place where I lived.'' He refused to
comment further.
   Rigoberto Lainez, a refugee leader, said: ``We are all very happy
to be in our country and we hope that they let us work in peace,
since our government told us we have the constitutional right to
return to the places we are from.''
   The refugees join 4,300 others who returned from Honduras in 1987
and 1,230 who came back in August.
   Although some say the camps are like jails, the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees says 14,000 refugees have chosen to remain
in Honduras. At Mesa Grande, 3,600 preferred to stayed behind,
despite the poverty and makeshift housing. Many said they were
afraid to return to El Salvador.
   Juan, an 18-year-old who has been at Mesa Grande since he was 10,
said in an interview there Saturday he doesn't like the camp but
felt he would be risking his life returning to El Salvador.
   Back home, the refugees will confront suspicions that they are
collaborators of leftist guerrillas fighting a 9-year-old war
against the U.S.-backed government.
   ``They come to live near the hydroelectric dams and serve as
suppliers of the guerrillas,'' Col. Ciro Lopez Roque, commander of
the 4th Infantry Brigade in Chalatenango, said.
   Interior Minister Edgar Belloso Funes, who met the refugees as
they returned, said: ``Some are collaborators of the guerrillas, but
I can't say they all are.''
   Refugee leader Lainez questioned how the refugees could be
accused of working with the guerrillas after living for eight years
in a place where they cannot come or go without permission of the
Honduran army.
   The Honduran government has pushed for repatriation of the
refugees for several years, saying the camps have become sanctuaries
for guerrillas who operate along the border.
   About 65,000 people have died in El Salvador's civil war, the
majority of them civilians.

<DATELINE>MILTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elderly couple is suing their son for
allegedly defrauding them of their home by having it put in his name
to save money on inheritance taxes.
   Hyman Freeman, a retired fruit seller, and his wife, Frances, who
are in their late 70s, two years ago agreed to put the house in
their son's name.
   The agreement called for Leonard Freeman, 52, to be responsible
for upkeep of the house while his parents lived there on a 25-year
lease, the Freemans said. The deal allowed them to cancel if they
wanted and have the title put back in their name, they said.
   But the younger Freeman hasn't made some necessary repairs, the
Freemans said, and they've sued to get the property back, without
the $100,000 mortgage they say their son took out on the house to
get a line of credit.
   Leonard Freeman challenged his parents' claim and now both sides
are scheduled to meet in court in January.
   The Freemans fear that losing the lawsuit could also mean losing
the roof over their head.
   ``We won't have enough to live on,'' Hyman Freeman said.
   ``We haven't slept nights,'' Mrs. Freeman said. ``I'm up all
night crying. Every night I'm the same way. It's pretty tough when
your son does that to you _ and after you've been so good to him.''
   Leonard Freeman, a musician and court officer in Boston Land
Court, has declined to comment. And his lawyer, Paul Driscoll of
Marshfield, said only: ``I want to try my cases in court and not in
the arena of public opinion.''

   The French turned out in record low numbers Sunday
for a referendum on the future of New Caledonia, but those who did
vote overwhelmingly approved a plan the government hopes will buy 10
years of peace in the Pacific territory.
   Turnout was 37.32 percent, the lowest of any national election
since World War II.
   The figure confirmed a widespread lack of interest in the
referendum despite violence between native Melanesians and European
settlers that has killed 40 people in the past four years.
   France has controlled the territory since 1853.
   With 96 percent of the French results in and counting stopped for
the night, 79.91 percent had voted ``yes'' on a statute that would
clear the way for a 1998 vote on independence for New Caledonia. The
``no'' votes totaled 20.09 percent.
   In New Caledonia, 11,000 miles from Paris, the polls closed 12
hours before those in France. Official results there showed 57.03
percent voted ``yes,'' and 42.9 percent ``no.'' Turnout was 63.24
percent.
   ``Democracy has spoken,'' said Premier Michel Rocard shortly
after the French polls closed. ``It appears that 12 million French
have just approved the (proposed new) statute.''
   The voters were asked whether they approved a new local autonomy
statute for the archipelago for the next 10 years, followed by a
local referendum on independence.
   Most of the native Melanesians known as Kanaks, who make up 43
percent of New Caledonia's 145,000 inhabitants, want independence
from France. They are opposed by most of the European settlers, who
comprise 37 percent, and Asians and Polynesians, who comprise 20
percent.
   Sporadic violence has erupted between Kanaks and the white
population since 1984, culminating in a hostage-taking affair last
spring that left 25 dead.
   On April 22, a group of Melanesians attacked a police station at
Fayaoue on the island of Ouvea, killing four policemen and taking 27
hostage before retreating to a cave. After negotiations failed,
police attacked the cave May 5 and rescued the hostages, but 19
Melanesians and two policemen died.
   That episode sobered both pro-independence and anti-independence
leaders and brought them to the negotiating table. In June,
Jean-Marie Tjibaou, leader of the Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front, and Jacques Lafleur, head of the Rally for
Caledonia in the Republic party signed an agreement in Paris.
   Under the agreement:
   _Those charged with political crimes committed before Aug. 20
will be amnestied, except those directly implicated in murder.
   _The archipelago will be divided into three provinces, each with
its own provincial assembly. The three assemblies will together form
a territorial congress.
   _New Caledonia will be governed directly from Paris until July
1989, when local administrations will take over.
   _A program of economic development and administrative training
will be implemented.
   _In 1998, a referendum will be held on independence, but only
those people now residents of New Caledonia will be able to vote.
   Only the extreme right French party National Front has campaigned
for a ``no'' vote in the referendum.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Says Democrats Can Win</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Election Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson said Sunday there would be more
enthusiasm in the U.S. presidential election if he were a candidate,
but he said the Democrats can pull off a victory like Harry Truman's
or John Kennedy's.
   Jackson, who lost the Democratic nomination to Gov. Michael
Dukakis of Massachusets, said in a London Weekend Television
interview he does not believe Vice President George Bush will win
Tuesday just because he now leads in the polls.
   In other British television interviews shown Sunday, Dukakis
accused Bush of running a negative campaign and said he waited too
long to respond. He also said he would never wage a negative
campaign, even if it mean certain victory.
   Bush said Dukakis has run from the label ``liberal'' because the
word's connotation in American politics has changed.
   Bush and Dukakis were interviewed separately by David Frost for
his Sunday morning program on TV-AM. The Republican candidate was
interviewed in Washington Nov. 1 and Dukakis was interviewed in
Kansas City Oct. 22.
   ``It's not over until it's over,'' said Jackson, who was
interviewed from Chicago.
   ``I would think that with the surge the Democrats are now feeling
across the country, gaps closing in states like California, New
York, Michigan, Illinois, if we continue this momentum through the
weekend, we could be just at that ... miracle quotient that Truman
experienced (in 1948) and John Kennedy later in 1960,'' he said.
   Interviewer Brian Walden asked Jackson whether he believed that
because he isn't on the ticket, blacks will be disillusioned and
stay away from the polls.
   ``Blacks have been disillusioned and yet blacks are resilient,''
Jackson said, but he conceded there would be ``a higher degree of
enthusiasm'' if he were a candidate.
   Asked what his role in the administration would be if the
Democrats win, Jackson replied: ``We've discussed no role and I have
no interest at this point in a role.''
   Frost asked Bush whether he believes ``liberal'' is a bad word.
   ``Well I think there are certain things in the liberal tradition,
standing up for the little guy, that's good. But liberal has taken
on a different connotation in American politics, or else why would
the opponent have been running away from the label for so long?''
Bush responded.
   Frost then asked Bush whether he was glad Dukakis was now
describing himself as a liberal, in the tradition of Franklin
Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John Kennedy.
   ``He can do what he wants to do. I think I have every right to
point it out. In the (second) debate he got all over me like ugly on
an ape for even bringing it up,'' Bush said, using a phrase he said
he first heard in the Texas oil fields in 1948.
   Dukakis described himself as a ``liberal'' in the tradition of
the presidents who gave America social security, the minimum wage
and Medicare but added, ``I'm also a lot more fiscally conservative
than Vice President Bush.''
   He accused the Republicans of attempting ``to convey the sense
that if you're a quote liberal, you don't have values, you don't
have standards.''
   ``Now, why are they doing this? I think it's because they want
people to forget that in a very real sense, they've had one of the
most liberal borrow and spending sprees we've ever had in this
country. It's the antithesis of conservatism.''
   Dukakis said he reacted too slowly to the ``negative kind of
campaigning that apparently was part and parcel of Republican
strategy from the beginning.'' But he said he could never wage a
relentlessly negative campaign even if it meant certain victory in
the election.

   Here are excerpts of Democrat Michael
Dukakis' speech Sunday:
   ``For months, George Bush has been following me around on the
issues. Have you noticed? He discovered education a few months ago.
He even discovered the environment a few months ago, after being a
member of the original wrecking crew that went to Washington,
remember, in 1981 ...
   ``In recent days he's been following me around the country. And
now he's following me to Colorado. I'll tell you one place he's not
going to follow me. He's not following Lloyd Bentsen and me to 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue, I'll tell you that. ...''
   ``He's slipping and sliding. We're rocking and rolling, aren't we.
   ``We're taking our case directly to the American people. He's
trying to keep Dan Quayle away from the American people. Have you
noticed?
   ``He thinks you can inherit the White House. I think you have to
earn the right to be president of the United Staters.
   ``The Republcians have run the most critical and the most
hypocritical campaign I think I've ever seen in my political career.
Full of distortions and lies and just plain garbage.
   ``But as they slip they're going to become more and more
desperate, and you're going to be seeing and hearing more of this
right up to Tuesday. The latest one is gun control.
   ``You've been hearing about it, haven't you, here in Colorado.
I've always supported the rights of hunters and sportsmen to buy and
own weapons and to use them. That's not what I'm concerned about.
It's not what you're concerned about. We're concerned about
teenagers with Uzis and AK-47s running around our cities killing
people.
   ``We're concerned about crack gangs and drug dealers that are
threatening the lives of our law enforcement officers. ... We're
concerned about cop killer bullets. We think there ought to be at
least a seven-day waiting period before a convicted felon or
somebody with a history of mental illness walks into a store and
buys a gun. That's what we're concerned about. ...
   ``I support the right of people to protect themselves in their
own homes, subject to state regulation. This is a law enforcement
issue. That's what it is. And that's what I'm talking about. And I
hope you'll take that message back to your friends and your
communities.''
   ``We can't let these lies and distortions stand unanswered in
this campaign, and we're not going to. We're not going to.''

<HEAD>Two Killed As Guerrillas Blow Up Power Towers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two people, possibly leftist extremists,
were killed and two others injured in a late-night bombing of
several electrical towers that blacked out much of central Chile,
police said Sunday.
   In telephone calls to local newspapers, the country's principle
urban guerrilla group, the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, claimed
responsibility for blowing up at least eight high-voltage towers in
central Chile shortly after 10 p.m. Saturday.
   ``It's a warning to (military President Augusto) Pinochet,'' the
Santiago daily La Epoca quoted a spokesman for the group as saying.
``He's got to go.''
   The 72-year-old Pinochet lost an Oct. 5 referendum on extending
his rule. Open elections to pick a successor are planned for late
next year, but political opponents are calling on Pinochet to step
down sooner.
   The blasts knocked out power to a 400-mile expanse including this
capital city, where more than 4 million of the country's 12 million
people live. The outage stretched from San Fernando, 90 miles south
of Santiago to La Serena, 295 miles to the north.
   In Temuco, 420 miles south of Santiago, police said they found
the badly damaged bodies of a man and a woman killed the previous
night in the bombing of an electrical pole. Police said a knapsack
containing explosives and two handguns was found near the bodies,
indicating the victims may have been blown up by their own bomb.
   Police said they found and disactivated bombs at two other towers
in the southern port city of Concepcion.
   A couple parked in a truck in the town of Talagante, about 25
miles west of Santiago, were injured when a nearby bomb went off at
a nearby electrical tower, police said, adding that at least six
other towers in the Santiago area were bombed.
   Some Santiago neighborhoods remained without electricity for more
than an hour before lights went back on early Sunday.
   Also Sunday, an anti-government street rally called by labor
unions to demand Pinochet's resignation drew only a few thousand
people.
   Neither organizers nor police gave a crowd estimate, but
journalists calculated attendance at no more than 5,000, much lower
than the hundreds of thousands who attended rallies before the
referendum.
   Pinochet siezed power in a bloody 1973 coup that toppled the
elected government of Marxist President Salvador Allende.

<DATELINE>WAUWATOSA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pastor appealed Sunday for spiritual
understanding of the terrorists holding nine Americans hostage in
the Middle East as an interdenominational service pondered news from
Lebanon.
   ``Oh, God of all people, teach us how to pray now for those we
identify as enemies in our lives,'' said the Rev. Thomas Kojis, who
was aboard a jetliner in Greece that was damaged by a terrorist bomb
in 1986.
   Kojis, pastor of the Wauwatosa Avenue United Methodist Church,
was among seven clergy of several denominations participating in a
prayer service for the hostages at the Underwood Memorial Baptist
Church in Wauwatosa, a Milwaukee suburb.
   Kojis said he wanted to discuss the captors as well and what
might have motivated them to take Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was captured March 16,
1985, and is the longest-held U.S. hostage.
   A videotape in which Anderson says President Reagan and Vice
President George Bush have not done enough to secure his release
surfaced last Monday. Sunday's event was planned for several months
and was not intended as a political message, said the Rev. Reid
Trulson, pastor at the host church. About 50 people attended.
   They spoke about Anderson and the other hostages, the hostages'
families and those negotiating for their release with shadowy
captors.
   ``Part of us wants to destroy our enemies, terminate them, wipe
them off the face of the earth. Part of us is blinded in the dark
about who the captors really are,'' Kojis said. ``Some of us here
have neatly divided the situation into two camps: us and them.''
   ``Deeper than those things that divide us from the captors, there
is that which unites us. We are all brothers and sisters,'' he said.
   Kojis said he and his family have had time to recover since a
bomb exploded across the aisle from them in a TWA jetliner April 2,
1986, killing four occupants.
   When he heard what the other pastors planned to say during the
memorial service, he said, he chose to concentrate on the captors
because ``it was going involve a lot of reflection.''
   ``To try to walk in your enemies' shoes, to empathize, which
seems so difficult,'' he said. ``How do you walk in the shoes of
your captor? I think those are all the challenges that await us in
faith.''
   Anderson was a particular focus of the service because of the
attention surrounding his recent birthday, the videotape, and new
photographs of him distributed last month.
   One photo was delivered to a Western news agency Friday along
with a statement from the Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, saying
Washington would not take ``realistic steps'' to end the ordeal of
14 captives held in Lebanon, nine of whom are American.
   In the most recent photograph Anderson is pictured before a
birthday cake. Oct. 27 was his 41st birthday.

<TEXT>
   All but one of the fires
in Yellowstone National Park has been declared controlled following
recent snowfalls, the park announced Sunday.
   Just the Clover-Mist blaze, which burned in Yellowstone and the
adjacent Shoshone National Forest, is not declared controlled, said
park spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt.
   Wintry weather in the country's first national park late last
week help get the North Fork, Wolf Lake and Snake complex of fires
under control, she said.
   Active firefighting efforts on the blazes ended weeks ago, but
officials have continued to keep a close eye on the fires. As of
Saturday, more than 200 people and four helicopters were keeping
watch.
   Officials have estimated that the fires covered an area of 1.1
million acres, burning about 20 percent of that.
   Snow depths in the 2.2 million-acre park on Sunday ranged from an
inch or less to as much as a foot.
   The snow also forced park officials on Sunday to close
Yellowstone's south and east entrances, probably until the spring.
Other roads in the park remain open.

   One person matched all six numbers in the Illinois
Lotto to win at least $38 million, the state's second largest
jackpot ever, officials said Sunday.
   The player, who has not stepped forward to claim the prize, will
receive the money in annual payments after taxes over the next 20
years, said Sharon Sharp, director of the state lottery.
   Saturday's drawing capped a week of ``Lotto fever'' in which
ticket sales totaled $26.7 million, including $11.5 million on
Saturday alone.
   The state's 4,100 machines processed a record 26,000 tickets per
minute in the hour before the 7 p.m. drawing, and sales topped $1.1
million an hour.
   The prize grew as no one matched all the Lotto numbers for three
consecutive weeks. The winning numbers were: 33, 35, 43, 44, 45, and
52.

<TEXT>
   Elizabeth Ramos, an AIDS patient-turned-activist
who won a $750,000 malpractice lawsuit when a doctor misdiagnosed
her AIDS-related illness, has died. She was 33.
   Ms. Ramos, who lived in Cambridge, died Friday.
   A Middlesex Superior Court jury in January found Dr. Kenneth
Bernstein of Newton was negligent in treating and diagnosing Ms.
Ramos in 1985 when she had pneumocystis pneumonia, which kills many
AIDS patients.
   Bernstein testified that he diagnosed Ms. Ramos as having
bronchitis and asthma, based on X-rays, physical exams and clinical
judgment.
   ``While the legal fight was important to her personally, it was
her efforts against AIDS that were the most important activities to
her in the last days of her life,'' said her attorney, Paul Collier.
   ``Whatever strength she had,'' especially as the illness
progressed, ``was committed to publicizing, advocating and educating
(people about) the importance of the struggle against AIDS,''
Collier said.
   Ms. Ramos attended conferences around the country to talk about
AIDS among Hispanics. She also visited schools to talk to children
about being aware of the disease and not being prejudiced against
those afflicted with it.
   This summer she was a top fund-raiser in the Walk for Life in
Boston.
   Ms. Ramos is survived by two sons.

<HEAD>Bentsen Sees No Mandate, Says Dukakis Can Cope Better than Bush</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs with additional Bentsen quotes.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen said Sunday that the presidential campaign, no matter who
wins, will not leave the next president with a ``serious mandate.''
   That ``means more work and a lot more swabbing that has to be
done, and I think Mike Dukakis can do that,'' he said of his party's
standard-bearer.
   Bentsen appeared on both NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press'' and on
CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.'' NBC said Republican Dan Quayle had
also been invited but turned down the invitation, and journalists on
the show said Quayle had appeared on no national television
interview shows during the campaign.
   On CBS, Bentsen predicted that congressional Democrats would not
gang up on Bush if Bush were elected.
   ``Not gang up, no, but I don't think he gets any brownie points
(from) the kind of campaign he's run. It's been an extremely
negative one,'' the Texas senator said.
   Bentsen reiterated his indignation at the Republican's negative
advertising.
   ``They've had an effect and they've hurt and they demean the
process,'' he told NBC. Bush's wife and one of his sons defended the
vice president on CBS. ``You can't persuade me that George has run a
dirty campaign,'' said Barbara Bush. ``He hasn't.''
   Jeb Bush said Dukakis was ``fair game'' and he didn't expect his
father to face resentment if elected. ``My dad has a great ability
to heal wounds,'' he said.
   Bentsen, asked if Bush would find a stalemate greeting him
because of a lack of a mandate on specific issues, said: ``Frankly,
I don't think either candidate at this point has a serious mandate.''
   Afterward, he told reporters, ``Michael Dukakis will not have as
much of a mandate as he deserves because it was difficult to get the
issues across with all the clutter of negative advertising. But I
also believe the two of us together, with me as vice president ...
that we will be able to get our legislative program through better
than George Bush and Dan Quayle would.''
   Bentsen said that if he returned to his post as chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, he would not try to use that forum to
wreak vengeance on Bush.
   ``We have to much at stake in this country to try to seek revenge
or something like that,'' he said. ``We're on a mountain of debt in
this country, and our budget deficit and our trade deficit, and
those things have to be turned around.''
   ``I'd work with any president, for my country. I'd help when I
thought he was right, and I'd try to block him when I thought he was
wrong,'' Bentsen said. ``That's what I hired out to do.''
   Asked to look at 1992 if the Republicans won this time, the
67-year-old Bentsen declined to say if he'd run for president.
   ``I believe in 1992 ... I'll be running for vice president and
Mike Dukakis will be finishing a first and successful term of
office,'' he said.
   When reporters asked him later if this was his last campaign, he
joked, ``What do you mean, a kid like me? I've been in politics long
enough to know to never say never.''
   Bentsen headed back to his home state of Texas after appearing on
the network interview shows in Chicago.
   Bush strategist and pollster Robert Teeter said his surveys
showed Texas, the state that Dukakis chose Bentsen to help win, was
firmly in Bush's column and a statewide newspaper poll backed up
that assertion.
   A survey sponsored by the Dallas Morning News and the Houston
Chronicle gave Bush a 56-39 lead in Texas. The survey had a
four-point margin of error.
   ``If they had it all locked up, why is the Bush-Quayle campaign
dumping a half million dollars in negative ads'' in the state,
Bentsen said at a rally in Corpus Christi. President Reagan's stop
in the state and Republican Party spending were also evidence it was
close, he said.
   ``Let's go flat out for the next couple of days,'' he told the
crowd of about 800 in the local civic center.
   In El Paso, Bentsen told a rally outside the city's train station
that the Democrats are concerned about the middle class _ a theme
Dukakis has been hammering in his campaign stops.
   ``Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen are on the side of the working
men and women of America and the Republicans are on the other
side,'' said the Democratic candidate, who addressed the crowd in
both Spanish and English _ an appeal to the state's large Hispanic
population.
   As Bentsen's motorcade worked its way through the streets of El
Paso, citizens honked their car horns with approval.

   Police were preparing for about 2,000
people to attend the funeral Monday of a cadet who became ill and
needed a liver transplant after a vigorous training program at a
police academy.
   Timothy Shepard, 25, was one of 16 cadets hospitalized during the
first week of training at the state police academy in Agawam. The
cases of exhaustion and dehydration among the class of 50 cadets
prompted at least three state inquiries and resulted in the
resignation of the head of the state's police training program.
   Pittsfield Police Lt. Gerald Lee called Shepard's sudden turn for
the worst last week ``a shocking change.''
   The cadet had emerged from a coma and was slowly recovering _
even writing his wife, Holly, ``I made it'' _ although he was too
weak to breathe or speak on his own. He lost consciousness Oct. 31
and was operated on to remove a blood clot on his brain.
   He never regained consciousness and died Wednesday. An autopsy on
Friday indicated that he died from infections that set in because of
his weakened condition from the training and from the transplant.
   Among the 2,000 people expected to attend Monday's funeral were
most of Pittsfield's 86 officers, 40 officers from nearby
Springfield and 46 cadets still training at Agawam.
   State police had planned to send six cruisers of troopers, but
scaled back their plans after Shepard's family asked that state
police not attend the funeral. The family withdrew the request
Sunday.
   Lee said 50 police departments from New England and New York sent
their color guards.
   Shepard collapsed from heat stroke Sept. 19 at the end of the
grueling first day of training. Other cadets reported that they were
put through a strenuous regimen for hours on just a few cups of
water.
   Five days before Shepard died, Attorney General James Shannon
released the results of an investigation into the illnesses that
found a ``massive failure'' of the system led to abusive training.

<TEXT>
   A man was charged Sunday in a
hit-and-run death that was widely publicized when a lawyer refused
to identify a person who claimed to be the driver of the car.
   William D. Morser, a Delray Beach restaurateur, surrendered at
the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office and was charged with leaving the
scene of an accident involving death or personal injury, a
third-degree felony, said Jack Freese of the state attorney's office.
   Morser was booked and released on his own recognizance in an
agreement worked out between the state attorney's office and
Morser's attorney, Barry Krischer.
   Mark Baltes, a 28-year-old electrician, died March 9, 1986, when
he was struck and dragged 60 feet to his death.
   The following day, the driver contacted Krischer and asked him to
keep his identity secret and negotiate a plea deal, which fell
through.
   Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Timothy Poulton on Oct. 13 upheld
the attorney's right to keep the name of the client secret, but
later indicated he might change his decision after reviewing
Krischer's testimony.
   Baltes' parents had offered a $1 million reward and appealed to a
national television audience on CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes'' for
information that might reveal the driver's identity.
   Mrs. Baltes and her ex-husband, Joseph Baltes, filed a lawsuit in
February over the fatal accident. The case has been pending in Palm
Beach Circuit Court as investigators tried to track down the driver.
   Investigators were able to get a car description from pieces of
the grill and paint chips found in Baltes' skull.
   Investigators Friday traced the car to a West Palm Beach address.

   Spelman College, a predominantly black women's
school, inaugurated its first black woman president on Sunday.
   Johnnetta B. Cole, who took office in July 1987, has become known
as ``Sister President'' at the 107-year-old school, the nation's
oldest private, four-year undergraduate liberal arts college for
black women. A few non-blacks attend the school.
   The formal inauguration ceremony for Spelman's seventh president
was held at Atlanta's Civic Center.
   Ms. Cole, 51, a native of Jacksonville, Fla., served previously
as professor of anthropology and director of the Latin American and
Caribbean Studies Program at Hunter College of the City University
of New York.
   She was honored in a weekend of festivities, including a
symposium on the empowerment of black women, a tribute to black
women writers, a jazz concert by Max Roach and his band and the
recitatation of a special poem by Pulitzer Prize-winner Gwendolyn
Brooks.
   The college also accepted a $20 million gift from television star
Bill Cosby and his wife, Camille, for a new academic center. A
daughter of Cosby's attended Spelman. It was the largest gift in the
college's history.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis both laid claim Sunday to
precious, last-minute momentum in their campaign marathon, the vice
president confidently saying the tide was ``moving in our
direction'' and his combative rival insisting he was ``rocking and
rolling'' to an upset victory.
   The national polls said it would take a Massachusetts Miracle for
Dukakis to win on Tuesday. ``There ain't no stopping us now unless
we stop ourselves,'' said the vice president.
   The political equivalent of a nuclear exchange occurred on
television, where the Republicans and Democrats spent millions of
dollars in advertising for the waning hours of the campaign. The two
candidates bought time for 30-minute commercials on all three major
networks for election eve on Monday.
   Both candidates battled the clock and physical exhaustion in a
final drive to snare undecided voters and nail down the presidency.
   Gallup said Bush was ahead by 12 percentage points and USA
Today-CNN said the vice president led by 11. ABC made it 10 and CBS
put the margin at nine. An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll and
another by Harris reported a 5-point edge for the vice president and
said there was still plenty of room for last minute changes.
   An Associated Press tabulation showed Bush leading for 356
electoral votes, although he could not yet count securely on the 270
needed for victory. The tabulation showed Dukakis leading for 101
electoral votes, while 78 were in tossup states including
Pennsylvania, Illinois and Missouri.
   A 50-state poll by ABC News and The Washington Post put 25 states
firmly in Bush's column and another 16 leaning his way, which would
provide more than the necessary 270. Only the District of Columbia
was firm for Dukakis.
   ``We can't turn the White House over to the people who claim to
be on our side but who left the country on its back,'' Bush said at
stops in Colorado Springs, Colo., and Los Angeles.
   Countered Dukakis, also beginning his day in Colorado: ``He's
slipping and sliding, we're rocking and rolling.'' He sought to
raise fears over the possibility that Bush _ if elected _ might put
vice presidential running mate Dan Quayle in charge of the White
House crisis management team.
   ``Gives you the chills, doesn't it?'' Dukakis asked. ``Think
about it _ the Cuban missile crisis, with Dan Quayle in charge.''
   Democrats voiced confidence they would retain or perhaps widen
their majorities in the House and Senate in Tuesday's balloting, and
they got little dissent from Republicans on that score.
   One of the tightest Senate races was in Florida, where a
late-hour poll showed a virtual dead heat between Democratic Rep.
Buddy MacKay and Republican Rep. Connie Mack for the seat being
vacated by Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles.
   Democrats also hoped for modest gains among the 12 statehouse
races on the ballot.
   It was the costliest campaign in American history, and just one
piece of it, a series of California ballot initiatives, had a price
tag of more than $100 million.
   Both men drew large crowds in the campaign's final days, and drew
strength from them. And in the final two days, the presidential
candidates thought no more about flying across the country than most
voters thought about walking across the street.
   Bush aide Alixe Glen described the vice president's rapidly
changing itinerary as a ``Magical Mystery Tour.'' Dukakis embarked
on two days of non-stop campaigning that would carry him from the
West Coast to the Midwest, back to California and then back home to
Massachusetts by election morning.
   A series of state polls provided a picture of several close
races. One poll gave Bush a 17-point lead in Texas, with its 29
electoral votes. But Dukakis was reported gaining on Bush in the
latest survey in Colorado, and holding an eight-point lead in Iowa.
   NBC News and the Wall Street Journal said its nationwide survey
completed Saturday night showed the vice president with a lead of 48
percent to 43 percent _ an erosion over two weeks ago.
   Bush pollster Robert Teeter, interviewed on the NBC-TV's ``Meet
the Press,'' rejected complaints that the vice president had run a
nasty campaign and said private GOP surveys showed Bush leading by a
bigger margin than reported by the network.
   Teeter said he believed the number of voters who were wavering
was much lower, ``somewhat under 10 percent.''
   Bush professed little doubt about the outcome Tuesday.
   ``Things are moving in our direction,'' he said as he raced
Sunday from Colorado to California to Michigan.
   Dukakis, in a desperate race, noted that both candidates began
the day in Colorado.
   ``For months George Bush has been following me around on the
issues. He discovered education a few months ago, he even discovered
the environment a few months ago,'' he said.
   ``This week he started following me around on my message, telling
people he's on your side. Now he's following me around the country.
I'll tell you one place he's not going to follow me. He's not
following Lloyd Bentsen and me to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
   Bentsen, the vice presidential nominee, flew from Illinois to
Texas in a final bid to prevent Bush from taking his home state.
   In an NBC interview, Bentsen conceded that no matter which
candidate won, he wouldn't have much of a mandate after the election.
   He also said that if he returned to the Senate in a Bush
administration, he would help Bush when he thought it was deserved
and try to block him when he thought the president was wrong.
   Quayle, who shows up as a drag on the Republican ticket in
virtually all the polls, declined invitations to appear on network
television and campaigned Sunday in Virginia, one of the safest
Republican states where a new poll showed Bush with a 56-25 lead.
   Dukakis used his 30-minute campaign-closing commercial to show
himself responding to questions from average Americans and to
trumpet the populist theme that has adopted in the hope of scoring
an upset on Tuesday.
   ``Look in the mirror and ask yourself,'' he says in a film clip
taken from a rally. ``Is George Bush on your side?''

   Andrei D. Sakharov arrived here Sunday to visit
with relatives and undergo medical tests on his first visit outside
the Soviet Union after years of agitation over Soviet human rights
policies.
   Speaking through a translator, the tall, balding physicist and
Nobel laureate called himself a free man but said others remain in
prison who helped him through his years in internal exile in a
Soviet city closed to Westerners.
   ``Two years ago, I became a free man when I returned from Gorky
to Moscow. Now I have become even freer because I have been granted
the right to travel around the world,'' Sakharov told reporters
during a brief meeting.
   ``But a man who staged a one-person demonstration on my behalf in
January 1980 when I was exiled to Gorky remains in prison. The name
of that man is Vazif Meilanov ... and I feel it is my duty now, at
this moment, to remember this man and many others who remain in
prison.''
   Meilanov is a Soviet mathematician.
   Among the relatives Sakharov will visit in the Boston area are
his stepson Alexei Semyonov, Semyonov's wife, Liza Alekseyeva, and
their 4-year-old daughter Alexandra, whom he never has seen.
   Sakharov also will participate in the first board meeting outside
the Soviet Union of the International Foundation for the Survival
and Development of Humanity. The foundation was formed in January by
Soviet and U.S. scientists and educators to support research on
global problems.
   ``I think that my country ... and your country can do a great
deal together for peace and to eliminate hunger and violence,''
Sakharov said.
   He began his remarks by saying that he has a great deal of
respect for the United States, which he said is ``indeed a truly
great country.''
   Sakharov said he has a special feeling for the city of Boston
``because it gave shelter to my dear ones.''
   Sakharov was accompanied to the news conference by his
stepdaughter and her husband, Tatiana and Efrem Yankelevich. He will
stay with the couple in Newton during his visit.
   During his stay he will undergo tests at Massachusetts General
Hospital for a heart condition and possible implantation of a
pacemaker.
   He is scheduled to travel to Washington to attend the board
meeting of the foundation, which is chaired by Yevgeny Velikhov,
vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Velikhov
accompanied Sakharov on the trip from the Soviet Union.
   Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner, remained in Moscow.
   His two-week trip comes less than two years after he was freed
from internal exile stemming from his opposition to the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan.
   Sakharov, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights
activities, told reporters at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport earlier
that he was pleased to be going to Washington for a meeting of the
International Foundation for the Survival and Development of
Humanity.
   Sakharov, 67, kissed his wife in a diplomatic lounge where they
had waited, smiling and holding hands, and then headed for the New
York-bound plane. Reporters who went to the airport were not allowed
in the lounge but could watch from a distance.
   On a brief walk from a white Volga sedan to the lounge, he told
reporters there still are political prisoners in the Soviet Union,
including an unknown number in mental institutions.
   Sakharov left using the blue passport of a member of an official
delegation, not a red passport of an average Soviet citizen. He was
traveling with Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences. Both men are members of the board of the
foundation.
   The granting of an exit visa to Sakharov was a dramatic
indication of the changes in Soviet society under Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. Sakharov helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb but in
the 1970s became a leader in the Soviet dissident movement.
   Sakharov was exiled to the closed industrial city of Gorky in
January 1980 for his criticism of the Soviet military intervention
in Afghanistan the previous month. His wife was banished to Gorky as
well in August 1984.
   Sakharov remained there until Gorbachev called him back to Moscow
in December 1986. Earlier that year, Gorbachev had told a French
newspaper Sakharov could not travel outside the Soviet Union because
he knew too many state secrets.
   Sakharov has continued his scientific work, and now concentrates
on the origins of the universe. He speaks out occasionally on human
rights issues.
   In June, he said Gorbachev deserves to be given time and trust in
his efforts to reform Soviet society, but in September told
reporters he saw signs that Gorbachev was ``backtracking'' on some
elements of his reforms.
   The International Foundation for the Survival and Development of
Humanity was formed in January by Soviet and American scientists and
educators. The group's headquarters is in Moscow, but it has offices
in Stockholm and Washington.
   Its board meeting will be held in Washington Nov. 13-17.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis, battling
against the clock to keep his presidential hopes alive, heaped scorn
on the Republican ticket Sunday and accused George Bush of
``following me around on the issues.''
   Dukakis campaigned across the West in an urgent final appeal for
votes before Tuesday's election. Aides pointed with enthusiasm to
new polls showing him continuing to narrow the GOP nominee's lead.
   ``I can smell victory in the air,' the Democratic nominee told a
rally of 10,000 people in the Denver suburb of Westminster within
sight of the snow-capped Rocky Mountains. ``He's slipping and
sliding. We're rocking and rolling.''
   Dukakis later spoke to a crowd estimated at 10,000 people
outdoors at Portland State University in Oregon, where he charged
Bush was following him around the country.
   ``They're getting so worried Bush is following me around _ can
you believe it,'' he said.
   ``We're taking our case to the American people,'' Dukakis said.
``He's trying to keep Dan Quayle away from the American people.''
   Dukakis' schedule remained in flux as aides tried to figure where
to send him in the final hours of the 1988 campaign.
   He planned to fly from the Northwest late Sunday evening for
Cleveland and St. Louis, then jet back to the West Coast for a
mid-day event in San Francisco. A later event was also being planned
in an undisclosed site.
   Dukakis was keeping an around-the-clock campaign schedule that
would have him flying to events all night Sunday night and Monday
night, without stop.
   Despite unanimity in the polls that he was trailing, Dukakis at
each stop asserted he would win.
   ``We're going to win here,'' he said in Portland. ``We're going
to win in Washington. We're going to win in California. We're going
to win a victory and a great victory.''
   Clearly buoyed by cheering crowds, Dukakis said in Colorado that
Bush had been mimicking his own concerns on major issues and had
even borrowed his populist ``I'm on your side'' campaign slogan.
   ``George Bush has been following me around on the issues,''
Dukakis said. ``He discovered education a few months ago. ... He's
even discovered the environment.
   ``I'll tell you one place he's not going to follow me. He's not
following Lloyd Bentsen and me to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
   Renewing his harsh attacks on Republican vice presidential
nominee Dan Quayle, Dukakis quoted Bush as saying on a TV interview
Saturday that if elected, he might put Quayle in charge of the White
House crisis management group.
   Bush said it ``could be,'' but that he hadn't decided. But if
Bush did, Dukakis said, it would mean the youthful Indiana senator
would be responsible for managing the nation's response to the
gravest international incidents. ``Gives you the chills, doesn't
it?'' Dukakis said.
   ``Think about it _ the Cuban missile crisis, with Dan Quayle in
charge. ... That's a risk we Americans can't afford to take,'' he
said.
   ``Dan Quayle is not a crisis manager, he's a crisis that has to
be managed. That's what they've been trying to do since August.''
   In Tacoma, Wash., Dukakis spoke to a crowd of 7,000 people at the
University of Puget Sound, and took questions from a small group of
students afterward.
   He blasted Bush for what he said was a refusal by the vice
president to visit the school when the GOP nominee heard he would be
asked to take questions.
   ``How can you be president of the United States if you don't want
to answer some questions?'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis' advisers were encouraged by an NBC News poll released
Sunday that showed their candidate had narrowed the gap to five
percentage points, with the vice president leading 48 percent to 43
percent.
   They also said recent polls suggested Dukakis was getting the
larger share of voters who were only now making up their minds which
candidate they will support.
   But they were aware that Dukakis remained well behind Bush in
some critical states. Dukakis campaigned in Texas late Saturday
night, just as a Houston Chronicle poll showed him trailing Bush by
17 percentage points in that state.
   Dukakis strategists also were paying a lot of attention to Ohio,
where polls have shown Bush ahead and the Republicans investing
heavily in the outcome.
   Campaign chairman Paul Brountas said the candidate is ``moving in
most of the battleground states. Many of them are becoming dead
heats, and in many of them we're moving ahead.''
   Dukakis himself, while shaking hands with supporters, put it
simply: ``We're surging.''
   Dukakis was accompanied on his flight from Texas to Colorado by
actress Carrie Fisher. Among the TV actors accompanying him were Hal
Linden and John Larroquette of the ``Night Court'' program.
   Dukakis said Republican attacks on the gun control issue were
typical of what he called his opponent's campaign of ``distortions
and lies.''
   In a region where guns are a major issue, Dukakis reaffirmed his
support for gun ownership by hunters and sportsmen, and by
individuals ``subject to state regulation'' for their
self-protection.
   ``This is a law enforcement issue,'' Dukakis said. ``We can't let
these lies and distortions stand unanswered in this campaign, and
we're not going to.''
   In Texas late Saturday night, Dukakis denounced the Republicans
for ``big brother tactics'' he said were aimed at intimidating
Hispanics into not voting.
   The Democratic nominee urged Bush to halt GOP ads in the Rio
Grande Valley warning that election officials will be watching
polling places to see if non-citizens try to vote.

   Police fired 12 shots at an unarmed prisoner,
three of which struck and killed him as he tried to escape while
being transferred to another jail, officials said.
   Michael Reed, 28, was killed Saturday night.
   Maj. Eddie Macaluso of the Harris County Sheriff's Department
identified the detectives who shot Reed as Barry Rizk, 29, an
employee of the department since 1981, and Robert Nichols, 34, who
joined in 1983.
   Reed, who was wearing handcuffs and a knee brace, got out of the
detectives' car while it was stopped and started running along a
driveway, said Capt. Ken Stadler.
   The detectives grabbed their pistols, warned Reed to stop and
then started shooting, striking the man several times, Stadler said.
Reed was about 50 feet from the officers when they fired, he said.
   ``The reason the officers shot was they feared for their lives,''
Stadler said.
   Witnesses said at least one officer fired at Reed after he had
fallen to the ground.
   ``They didn't have to keep shooting that man,'' said witness
Elaine White.
   ``Hey man, I'm not going anywhere,'' Ms. White quoted Reed as
saying after he had been shot once in the leg and again in the torso.
   The Houston Post and the Houston Chronicle reported Reed was
struck by three bullets, one in the back and two in the chest.
Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen, called at home by The Associated Press
Sunday night, said he could not immediately provide details.
   Chief Deputy Tommy Thomas said department policy allows officers
to shoot suspects if they ``feel their lives are in danger or if
they are threatened _ that's the policy; it depends on the
individual.''
   Thomas said the department generally interprets the policy to
mean ``when the suspects have weapons.''
   The detectives were relieved of duty with pay pending an
investigation, Thomas said.
   The detectives fired with a .357 Magnum revolver and a 45-caliber
automatic, Thomas said.
   Reed was in jail on a car theft charge. He was being transferred
to the second jail on an outstanding felony escape charge.
   Reed previously had been arrested on two felony and one
misdemeanor escape charge. He also was being held in a felony drug
case, two misdemeanor theft charges and a resisting arrest case.
   Reed also escaped from the Louisiana Department of Corrections on
Sept. 1, 1985, while serving time for theft, sheriff's Capt. John
Mendenhall said.

<HEAD>Magazine: Oat Bran, Black Market Cacti, Ragged Jeans Were Hot Stuff
In 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you feasted on oat bran, fed Fido with gourmet
chow, pulled on a pair of pre-shredded jeans or leafed through a
comic book this year you were one of the Americans who made those
some of the hottest products of 1988, according to Adweek magazine.
   The hottest products largely were ``conspicuously unnecessary,''
the advertising and marketing trade magazine stated in this week's
issue, and ran the gamut from the ephemeral novelty to technological
nuisance.
   Trends in trendy stuff included rapidly growing demand for oats
in all forms, especially oat bran, among cholesterol-conscious
Americans; Upjohn Co.'s Rogaine hair-growth treatment, which
recently got federal government approval for prescription sales; a
new genre of comic books aimed at adult audiences, so-called
``graphic novels''; and slashed jeans, pre-damaged by the maker for
that rough-and-tumble look, for $50 a pair.
   The magazine said other hot stuff for 1988 included:
   _Upscale pet paraphernalia, including designer dog and cat
clothing, gourmet pet food and perfumed groomings;
   _Trendy foods like cheese-flabvored popcorn and fancy peppers;
   _Black market saguaro cactuses, illegally dug up and replanted as
lawn decorations in the Southwest;
   _Increased use of Retin A skin wrinkle treatment by younger
consumers;
   _Disposable extended-wear contact lenses;
   _Belt pouches, used by skiers, cyclists and, increasingly, city
pedestrians;
   _Technological devices such as home fax machines, electronic
still cameras that can play back snapshots on the television screen
and voice mail corporate telephone answering systems that direct
calls and record messages.
   _Scientific journals;
   _Adult literacy programs;
   _Computer security systems.
   Adweek also said the year featured a number of retro-trends
sparked by nostalgia-fueled baby boomers. Those included Mr. Potato
Head toys, Harley Davidson motorcycles and accessories, charm
bracelets, yo-yos, pink flamingos, convertible cars, seamed
stockings and garter belts, and a resurgence in train travel.

<HEAD>Trade Group: U.S. Heating Oil Supplies Adequate, Even For A Cold
Winter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's home heating oil supplies are
adequate even if the United States has a very cold winter, according
to an analysis by the American Petroleum Institute.
   The Washington-based trade organization said in a report released
Monday that based on its analysis of recent U.S. Energy Information
Administration figures, home heating oil demand this winter would
range from about 3.24 million to 3.52 million barrels per day.
   Total supply for the 1988-89 winter season, based on U.S.
refinery production, net imports and inventory drawdowns, will range
from 3.27 million barrels a day to 3.77 million barrels a day,
depending on the level of demand, according to API's analysis.
   The group said those amounts would be ``more than adequate to
meet anticipated demand, barring some unforeseen interruption in the
supply or transportation system.''
   Actual demand will depend on factors such as the weather, oil
prices and U.S. economic growth, the group said.
   For example, a winter that was 10 percent colder than normal
would boost demand by 75,000 barrels a day. Demand would be 40,000
barrels a day higher if heating oil prices were about $12.50 a
barrel, instead of the $16.50 a barrel price projected by the Energy
Information Administration, and would rise by another 25,000 barrels
a day if the economic growth rate was 1 percentage point higher than
the 2.25 percent growth projected by the EIA.

   The U.S. dollar moved higher against the Japanese
yen while share prices fell moderately at the start of trading
Monday.
   The dollar opened at 125.28 yen, up from last Friday's close of
124.63 yen.
   Dealers said the dollar's firmness reflected lower-than-expected
figures in the latest U.S. monthly jobless rate released last week.
   The Labor Department reported last Friday in Washington that the
U.S. unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in October from 5.4
percent the previous month. Market participants had expected the
figure to rise to 5.5 percent.
   Lower unemployment tends to reflect a stronger U.S. economy,
which is bullish for the dollar.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 93.50-point gainer Saturday, slipped 47.91 points
from Saturday's close to 27,998.84 shortly after the market opened.
