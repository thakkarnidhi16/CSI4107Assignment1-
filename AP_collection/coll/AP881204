<HEAD>Two Dead, 90 Injured In Train Crash</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: RETRANSMITTING to add editor's note: updates throughout with
92 injured, details</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   A commuter train slammed into another train stopped
at a Tokyo station on Monday, killing two people and injuring 92,
authorities said.
   Tokyo Metropolitan Police headquarters said the dead were a male
passenger who was pulled from a crushed car and the driver of the
moving train, Teruki Hirao, 28, who died in hospital of his injuries.
   Passengers said there was a huge crash and they were thrown to
the floor.
   ``The train was lifted up quite a bit and seats were broken and
thrown all over in the train,'' said an unidentified man in a
television interview.
   The Transport Ministry urged Japan Railways not to permit a
repeat of the accident, the worst since the national rail service
was privatized in April 1987.
   The collision occurred about 9:40 a.m. (7:40 p.m. EST) at the
Higashi-Nakano Station on the Sobu Line, one of Japan Railways'
surface commuter lines. The station is two stops west of Shinjuku
Station, a major railway and commuter line juncture in west-central
Tokyo.
   The cause of the crash was unknown, but news reports said
west-bound trains were running about 10 minutes behind schedule when
one of them smashed into the rear of another west-bound train
stopped in the Higashi-Nakano station. News reports said at least
600 people were on the two trains.
   The impact crushed parts of two cars and derailed several cars.
   About 10 fire department rescue teams worked to free people from
the crushed cars.
   Dazed and injured survivors were rushed to nearby hospitals.
   Keiko Uehara, who runs a bookstore near the Higashi-Nakano
Station, said the crash made such a noise that ``I thought a
building had fallen down.''
   A vice president of Japan Railways, Shuichiro Yamanouchi,
apologized for the crash at a news conference. News reports quoted
him as saying there was no known mechanical cause for the crash and
it might have been caused by an error of the driver, who died.
   The accident was the first involving injuries on Tokyo commuter
trains since March 1986 when about 60 people were hurt in the
collision of two trains. The last previous accident involving
fatalities was in December 1984 when a train driver was killed and
at least 120 people were injured in the head-on collision of two
trains.

   Actor Gary Busey was in critical
condition Sunday with severe head injuries after losing control of
his motorcycle, authorities said.
   Busey, 44, of Malibu underwent two hours of neurosurgery Sunday
evening, said Ron Wise, spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles. He was then transferred to intensive care.
   ``He's in critical condition following a motorcycle accident at
about noon. He has extensive head trauma,'' Wise said.
   Busey's work as the doomed 1950s rock star in the 1978 film ``The
Buddy Holly Story'' earned him an Academy Award nomination. The
one-time rock 'n' roll musician, who like Holly was born in Texas,
performed his own renditions of Holly songs in the film.
   Busey's manager, Herb Nanas, said information regarding the
surgery's outcome wouldn't be available until Monday.
   No other vehicles were involved in the crash in Culver City, some
10 miles west of downtown Los Angeles, said police Sgt. Gary McEwen.
The weather was clear and the road was dry at the time of the crash.
   ``He was on his motorcycle and went down,'' McEwen said.
   The crash occurred at about 11:40 a.m., said police Sgt. Karin
Reagan.
   ``Our initial investigation showed that he lost control of the
bike, laid it down and was thrown off,'' Ms. Reagan said. ``He hit
the curb with his head and wasn't wearing a helmet at the time of
the crash.''
   In addition to his role as Buddy Holly, Busey has appeared in
films such as ``Big Wednesday,'' ``A Star Is Born,'' ``Lethal
Weapon,'' ``Carny'' and ``The Bear.'' He was a star of an ABC-TV
comedy series, ``The Texas Wheelers,'' in 1974-75.
   An HBO cable TV miniseries, ``A Dangerous Life,'' was shown a
week ago. He played a television reporter covering the revolution
that put Philippine President Corazon Aquino in power and ousted
Ferdinand Marcos. Last year, he won an ACE award for cable
television as best actor in a drama series for an episode of ``The
Hitchhiker'' on HBO.
   The actor was born and grew up in Goose Creek, Texas, and went to
college in Kansas and Oklahoma. He beat well-publicized drug,
alcohol and overeating problems that temporarily stalled his career.
   In an interview 2{ years ago, he said he had gotten off drugs,
chiefly cocaine, and had lost 55 pounds. He took up drugs in the
aftermath of his success with ``The Buddy Holly Story,'' he said.
   ``I was up for an Academy Award my first time out of the chute,''
he said in the interview. ``That breeds insecurity. ... How was I to
come up to those expectations again? I was wondering if I was a
flash in the pan.''
   He married Judy Helkenberg in 1969; they have a teen-age son,
Jake.

<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who
have made arms control history together, are bound to revisit their
idea of a dramatic reduction in strategic weapons when they meet
over lunch this week, but a nudge forward, rather than a
breakthrough, is the most that's likely to result.
   The strategic arms reduction treaty that they have been talking
about _ the hoped-for centerpiece in Reagan's arms control program _
has too many holes in it for Gorbachev and Reagan to reach command
decisions during their three-hour luncheon Wednesday on Governors
Island in New York Harbor.
   Moreover, Gorbachev is well aware that he is dealing with a lame
duck president who will have six weeks left in office and will be in
no position to commit his successor, George Bush, to any course of
action.
   For all that, Max M. Kampelman, the chief U.S. arms control
negotiator, finds it difficult to believe arms will not be discussed
during lunch.
   ``I believe it will come up,'' Kampelman said in an interview
last week. ``But I don't believe it will come up in a negotiating
context. My own judgment is it will come up as a discussion and
maybe a quick review of where things stand now.''
   Kampelman added: ``And I guess perhaps an expression on both
sides they hope to finish the work. I cannot myself envisage any
detailed discussion of the arms negotiations taking place.''
   The unfinished strategic arms treaty will be turned over to
President-elect Bush's administration with, the U.S. side hopes, a
renewed commitment from Gorbachev to maintain its current high
priority.
   In a report to Congress on Friday, Reagan accused the Soviet
Union of violating existing arms control agreements with the United
States. ``We cannot conclude new strategic arms control agreements
while this violation remains uncorrected,'' the report said.
   The report cited Krasnoyarsk, a Siberian radar installation that
the administration contends violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty.
   However, Reagan did not accuse the Soviets of a ``material
breach'' of the agreement, which could have led to its unraveling.
And national security adviser Colin D. Powell said Reagan was not
expected to make ``a major issue'' of the U.S. allegations in the
meeting with Gorbachev.
   Reagan intends to raise arms control issues with the Soviet
leader, just as he will bring up the suspended Red Army withdrawal
from Afghanistan and the human rights situation, officials say.
   But the vital ground work simply has not been undertaken this
time. For example, Secretary of State George P. Shultz did not have
a planning session with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to
set an agenda and to define the issues for their leaders.
   Arms negotiations were adjourned in Geneva on Nov. 15 and the two
sides have not met since.
   They ended the 10th round of talks agreeing to an early
resumption in 1989. The United States subsequently proposed Feb. 15.
The Soviets did not respond.
   Reagan and Bush probably will have Shultz and a handful of other
senior U.S. officials at the luncheon table with them. But the U.S.
and Soviet arms control experts who normally labor over the details
while the leaders hold their summits plan no such sessions.
   Shultz has predicted a ``substantive'' discussion. Another U.S.
official, mindful of Gorbachev's innovative style, remarked, ``You
never can tell.''
   But the hard fact is that the treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet
armories of long-range bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 to 50
percent is still mired in disagreement on several key points.
   The two sides have not decided, for instance, whether to include
mobile missiles or sea-launched cruise missiles. Both are extremely
hard to track. That means cutbacks are hard to verify. The room for
cheating is uncomfortably wide.
   The Soviets, meanwhile, still would like to restrict Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative as part of a treaty deal. The $4
billion-a-year program is designed to stop ballistic missiles in
space, but critics here and in Moscow say it could extend the arms
race to a new and dangerous sphere.
   Then there is the fact a new U.S. administration is coming
aboard, one that may not share the outgoing administration's views
on reducing strategic weapons.
   Brent Scowcroft, designated by Bush to be his national security
adviser, is worried that large cutbacks in U.S. strategic weapons
could make the Warsaw Pact's edge in conventional forces in Europe
more significant.
   He also is concerned that reducing the U.S. arsenal of land-based
intercontinental ballistic missiles could expose those that remain
to a higher risk of being destroyed in the event of a Soviet attack.
   Bush will be at the table, deferring to Reagan. ``It will be
President Reagan's meeting,'' he said.
   And yet Reagan will be aware that, in a sense, he will be
speaking also for Bush and should not commit his successor to
positions he may not want to take after Jan. 20.

   If he's done his reading in Soviet history,
Mikhail S. Gorbachev knows just what to expect when he arrives in
New York City on Tuesday.
   It will be ``a huge, noisy city with an enormous number of neon
signs and automobiles, hence vast quantities of exhaust fumes that
(are) choking people.''
   It will have ``a humid, unpleasant climate,'' ``terrible poverty
and slums'' and protesters who act like ``howling tomcats.''
   It will have forests of tall buildings, but after all, ``If
you've seen one skyscraper, you've seen them all.''
   Those were the observations of the late Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev following his visits to New York in 1959 and 1960. If
Gorbachev has read ``Khrushchev Remembers: The Last Testament,''
he's probably having second thoughts about ever setting foot in the
citadel of capitalism.
   Of course, much has changed since Khrushchev's last visit, in
September and October of 1960.
   Khrushchev's trip took place at the height of the Cold War, just
after the shooting down of an American U-2 spy plane over the Soviet
Union.
   Gorbachev will be visiting New York during one of the warmer
periods in superpower relations, when U-2 is best known as a rock
group from Ireland.
   Khrushchev arrived by ship to a sodden reception at a dilapidated
East River pier. Gorbachev will arrive by jet and be greeted by a
delegation of U.N. officials and a 25-foot-by-10-foot sign
inscribed, ``General Secretary. Welcome to John F. Kennedy
International Airport. The Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey.''
   Khrushchev was booed almost everywhere he went, with the notable
exception of Harlem, where he paid an unexpected visit on Cuban
leader Fidel Castro in a rundown hotel.
   Gorbachev may be booed somewhere along the line, but he probably
won't do what Khrushchev did: Boo back. And Gorbachev is going to
wait until after his New York trip to visit Castro _ in Cuba.
   Khrushchev was shunned by President Dwight Eisenhower and the men
running to succeed him, Sen. John F. Kennedy and Vice President
Richard Nixon. Gorbachev will be meeting with both President Reagan
and President-elect George Bush.
   Khrushchev went to Wall Street on his first New York visit, in
1959, and got to meet with ``the biggest capitalist in the world'' _
Nelson Rockefeller. Gorbachev may skip Wall Street, but has accepted
an invitation from real estate tycoon Donald Trump to visit Trump
Tower.
   Finally, Gorbachev will almost certainly keep his shoes on in
public. It was during the 1960 trip that Khrushchev took off his
shoe and pounded it on the table in front of his seat at the United
Nations, thereby fixing his image in American memories forever.
   ``Some people did not seem to understand this unparliamentary
method,'' Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs.
   Khrushchev said he was ``not overly impressed'' by New York, but
he stuck around for more than two weeks on his last visit and kept
his hosts wondering when he would leave.
   ``I feel like staying, so I'm not going,'' he said at one point.
``I will stay here, but apparently I will not be granted
citizenship.''

   The melding of communism and democracy under
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is long overdue, America's top communist said
on the eve of the Soviet leader's visit.
   ``For years, I've been saying the socialist countries should move
in a democratic direction,'' said Gus Hall, general secretary of the
70-year-old Communist Party, U.S.A. ``There's no big threat _ they
can afford it.''
   ``It is true of any society ... Certain things get stuck and
changes don't take place corresponding to the new conditions. It's
necessary to shake up a society,'' he said. ``Socialism had reached
a level where some of the negative(s) had piled up. Somebody had to
provide a lead ... moving them to a higher state.''
   Glasnost and peace initiatives were among the topics on Hall's
mind as he and other Americans awaited Gorbachev's visit to New York
Tuesday through Thursday. The Soviet leader will address the United
Nations General Assembly and meet with President Reagan and
President-elect George Bush.
   ``I've met Gorbachev before he became general secretary and then
since,'' said Hall, 78, who has been employed full-time as general
secretary of the American communist party since 1959 and has run for
president four times since 1972.
   ``He's of a different generation and therefore, in many ways,
he's easier to deal with. He's very friendly and outgoing and easy
to talk to; if you express differences, it doesn't seem personal
with him,'' Hall said of Gorbachev. ``He's not afraid to try.
(Glasnost) calls for trial and error, and he seems to be very bold
in trying new ideas.''
   ``This is a historic moment in the socialist countries. They have
developed problems and they are correcting problems. They will
discard what doesn't work and keep what works. The Chinese are doing
a similar trial and error,'' Hall said in an interview Thursday. ``I
think much of it will stick. There's an experimentation with a
market economy and ... doing away with some of the centralization
that had taken place.''
   The Communist Party, U.S.A., advocates cooperatives and ``mom and
pop'' style, private enterprise, but eschews big corporations and
foreign involvement, said spokeswoman Carole Marks.
   Hall, who jokingly calls himself the ``big Red,'' said he sees no
contradiction in a communist advocating democracy, either here or in
the Soviet Union.
   ``There's no question that the more democracy, the easier it is
for people to fight for their rights. Like trade unions: the more
rights they have, the stronger they will be in fighting for wages
and so on,'' he said. ``There'll be some blurring of lines, but it
will not basically change the socialist concept.''
   In this country, ``our party has always stood for expanding the
democratic structure. ... Part of the electoral structure is very
undemocratic. We didn't run for president this year because the
restrictions were so severe it was hard to get on the ballot,'' he
said.
   The last time he did run, in 1984, Hall polled 36,386 votes which
was enough to beat out the Socialist Workers candidate but fell
54,418,689 votes short of Reagan.
   Despite his misgivings about the presidential election, Hall said
he thinks the Bush administration ``will not be quite as ideological
as the Reagan administration, but more realistic and practical.''
   ``The Bush administration will have to find some way of cutting
the expenditures. ... You can't be a first-rate power in the world
if you are a second or third-rate power at home and economically.''
   Marks said the United States has about 25,000 ``card-carrying
communists.''
   ``We're involved in the mainstream political life in this
country. We're accepted as the longstanding organization on the
left,'' she said.
   The group advocates creating a new political system for the
United States, but would not model it after the Soviet Union or any
other government, she said.

   At first, Dan's secret was small and shameful.
Then it festered and grew and took on a life of its own, tormenting
its keeper until it controlled his every waking hour.
   One day, Dan's secret became so ugly and overwhelming he could no
longer contain it. It came out at last: how Dan had been sexually
molested by an older brother who climbed into bed with him at age 9
and kept coming back for 10 years.
   But as terrible as it was, Dan's secret was only one piece of a
truth far more horrifying. It was like a pebble tossed in the deep,
silent pool that was his family, causing ever-widening ripples and
revelations.
   ``About 50 of my relatives have been abused. At least, those are
the ones I know about,'' said Dan, 23, who asked that his full name
not be used. ``It gets passed from generation to generation, and
nobody talks about it, and it so it never stops.''
   Dan's oldest brother, who had molested Dan, had himself been
molested by a favorite uncle. A female cousin had been molested by
her father. Dan's mother had been molested by a male relative. Other
cousins had been molested by their siblings, or other relatives.
   Dan was not alone as a male survivor of incest in his own family,
and he is not alone in the United States. A 1985 Los Angeles Times
survey found that one of every 15 adult males reported having been
sexually abused before the age of 18.
   An estimate of 15 million abused men is conservative, said
therapist Mike Lew, who works with male survivors of incest at his
Next Step Counseling and Training Center in Newton, Mass., outside
Boston.
   ``That doesn't include men who don't remember the abuse, that
doesn't include men who at this point aren't able to talk about it
yet, who are feeling too ashamed or too frightened,'' said Lew,
author of ``Victims No Longer,'' a book about recovery for male
incest survivors. ``It's just beginning to be safe enough to talk
about it.''
   Women were the first to talk about incestuous abuse, partly
because it is easier for society to accept the idea of women as
victims, Lew said.
   ``Men aren't supposed to be victims,'' he said. ``Men are
supposed to be able to handle everything, to be strong, to be
dominant. We don't know what to do with a man or boy who's been
victimized. We either define him as something other than a man or
something less than a man, or we deny the reality of the problem.''
   Hank Estrada's personal denial lasted 25 years, until the day he
discovered that the same uncle who had abused him for 12 years also
had tried to molest one of Hank's nephews.
   ``I got this nephew to tell me what had happened,'' said Estrada,
32. ``To do that, I had to share my own experience, which was very
difficult. But I didn't want him to go through what I did.''
   His sister, the boy's mother, reported the uncle to the
authorities, but because the abuse had merely been attempted and
because it was the boy's word against the uncle's, no charges were
filed.
   Estrada told his own story of abuse, which began at age 4 and
lasted until he was 16, but the statute of limitations had run out.
   ``It was a blatant denial by the system to let this man go,''
Estrada said. ``They're just waiting for him to do it again.''
   When Estrada went looking for support services for himself, ``to
show I was not the evil one for bringing all this out,'' he found
none; the only services available were for perpetrators. Two years
ago, he started PLEA _ for Prevention, Leadership, Education and
Assistance _ a Los Angeles-based group that offers support and
information to adult male survivors of abuse who are not abusers
themselves.
   A common misconception is that men who are sexually abused as
children always become perpetrators themselves, Lew said. In fact,
many male incest survivors become protectors of other people. Dan,
for example, works with the retarded.
   ``Many of the men who come for therapy come when they've become
parents or when their children reach the age they were at when they
were abused,'' Lew said. ``They come in determined that this is not
going to happen to their children. They've heard the mythology that
men who have been abused automatically become child abusers, and
they want to make sure they won't abuse children.''
   For many abused men, the idea of victimizing someone else is
horrifying. They know firsthand the terror, guilt and pain of being
a victim. They know how an abuser who is often someone a little boy
mosts trusts and loves _ father, mother, brother or uncle _ can turn
those emotions against the victim, filling him with guilt and
self-loathing.
   Dan tried to commit suicide twice. He used food as an escape; in
his sophomore year of high school, he weighed 310 pounds.
   ``The biggest reason I ate so much was hoping I could become ugly
to turn my brother off so he wouldn't touch me,'' Dan said. ``It
didn't work. It just added to my problems.''
   At 19, the abuse had become too much. ``I couldn't stand the
feeling of guilt, of shame, of hating myself for what was going on.
I knew it had to stop, and I was the only one to stop it,'' Dan
said. ``I got a gun illegally and kept it in my nightstand, and I
swore if he touched me, I would kill him.''
   Dan has since told his parents about what happened and has
confronted his brother, who denies having a problem. Estrada's
uncle, now in his 60s, still lives with his relatives and has access
to dozens of children.
   That makes it imperative for male incest survivors to tell their
stories, Estrada believes. Unless society knows that boys, too, can
be incest victims, it always will be difficult for future victims to
summon the courage to tell anyone about what is happening to them.
Break the silence: break the cycle of abuse.
   ``Most of the men who call and write me say, `I always thought I
was alone.' They're in so much pain themselves, they never thought
about their abuser doing it again, to someone else,'' Estrada said.
``It may have happened to you, and it's in the past. But it doesn't
stop there.''

<HEAD>Inquest Into IRA Killings Puts British Justice To A Test</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A long-delayed inquest into the
police killing of three unarmed IRA men is putting British justice
in Northern Ireland to another of its periodic tests of credibility.
   It took six years to get the inquest going, but within hours of
starting Nov. 14 it was mired in controversy, with families
demanding police be cross-examined.
   The hearing in the courtroom in Craigavon, County Armagh, is the
latest chapter in a debate that has raged since 1982 over whether
the British, in their war against the Irish Republican Army,
sometimes step beyond the law and shoot suspects dead on sight.
   There were three such incidents in 1982. Another occurred in
Gibraltar in March when anti-terrorist agents gunned down three
unarmed bombing suspects. A much-disputed inquest cleared the agents
of wrongdoing.
   And this summer, after an IRA bomb killed eight soldiers on a
bus, three armed IRA men were gunned down, allegedly while on an
assassination mission.
   The British government denies it ever acted outside the law, but
many critics question this, and the issue has bedeviled government
efforts to prove itself evenhanded in its treatment of the
province's Catholic minority.
   Major initiatives like new anti-discrimination laws, improved
housing and education, and investment in the strife-torn economy
tend to be obscured by the lingering Catholic refusal to believe in
British justice.
   Gervase McKerr, 31, and Eugene Toman and Sean Burns, both 21,
were killed on Nov. 11, 1982 as they drove on a road in Lurgan,
County Armagh.
   Their inquest began in September 1983 but was adjourned until now
because of the trial of the three policemen, who were acquitted of
murder charges, and the police refusal to turn over photographs and
statements to defense attorneys.
   At their trial, the three policemen testified that they believed
Toman and Burns intended to attack the security forces and did not
know the three were unarmed.
   Families of two of the IRA men walked out on the inquest's first
day because the coroner refused to order the three policemen who
carried out the killings to appear in court. He cited rules unique
to Northern Ireland which allow witnesses to submit written
statements without ever appearing for cross-examination.
   The families want the policemen cross-examined under oath.
   The wife of the third victim failed to win a High Court ruling
against the coroner and has turned to the Appeals Court. The
inquest, meanwhile, is adjourned pending the Appeals Court hearing.
   At one point Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the moderate Social
Democratic and Labor Party, the province's largest Catholic party,
got so upset at the inquest that he jumped from his public gallery
seat to demand that the police testify.
   ``I make this request in the interests of creating a proper
system of justice in the north of Ireland,'' Mallon said. ``I plead
with you not to let it be turned into the charade that a vast number
of people now believe it to be.''
   John Stalker, a senior police investigator from mainland Britain,
says he was removed when he got too close to proving that police
conspired to shoot the men, possibly in revenge for the IRA murder
of three policemen, and then covered up their actions.
   The British government admits there was perjury and a cover-up in
the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, but has
ruled out prosecutions on national security grounds.
   The Constabulary, being 85 percent Protestant, has a hard time
convincing Catholics that it is exercising its sweeping powers with
restraint. Statistics show that less than 25 percent of those
arrested under anti-terrorism laws in the province are charged.
   Moreover, to overcome jury intimidation, security suspects are
tried by one-judge, no-jury courts.
   Unlike in mainland Britain, inquest juries in Northern Ireland
cannot return actual verdicts _ only basic findings of who died and
when and where they were killed.
   ``The coroner can't say that the (Constabulary) men were guilty
of shooting these people. He can't say that these people should be
tried. They've already been tried, which is another farce,'' says
Jackie Donnelly, spokesman for the outlawed IRA's legal political
wing, Sinn Fein.
   Amnesty International, in a report in June, maintained that
Northern Ireland inquests ``cannot address questions central to the
circumstances of deaths and to responsibility for deaths'' because
they cannot return a verdict of unlawful killing.

   A fire in a dump at a sawmill on Sunday
sent smoke and fumes through a nearby residential area, prompting an
evacuation warning that affected about 275 people before the blaze
was extinguished, authorities said.
   The warning was lifted at late evening after tests showed no
hazardous fumes, officials said.
   ``The fire is out,'' said Terri Belt, public information officer
for the Hart County Disaster and Emergency Services. ``The EPA has
been up there, has done the air tests and they have not found any
hazards in the smoke.''
   The blaze, believed to have begun Saturday, kept smoldering hours
after firefighters covered it with dirt Sunday afternoon, said Bill
Crabtree, coordinator of the state Disaster and Emergency Services
agency in the county.
   ``We have truck tires, plastics, wiring that's coated with
plastic, coated with rubber, big balls of nylon. Really, we don't
know for sure what's in there burning,'' Crabtree said.
   Fumes from the fire caused shortness of breath and burning eyes
to those exposed to it, Crabtree said.
   No one showed up for hospital treatment, however, said a
spokeswoman at Caverna Memorial Hospital.
   The material apparently had been covered with sawdust and logging
products at Anderson Forest Products, 3 miles north of Munfordville,
he said. Crabtree said he could not comment on whether anyone would
be cited for the dump, which he said was not legal.
   The blaze did not threaten any property ``except the property
it's on,'' he said. ``There's not buildings involved in it.''
   A shelter was set up for evacuees at Hart County High School, he
said.

   A man stabbed his 8-year-old daughter
to death and critically injured his three other children Saturday in
a predawn rampage through the family home, police said.
   Michael Wayne Nida, 31, also cut his wife and then slashed his
own wrists and stomach, and was arrested for investigation of
homicide, police said. He was listed in serious condition at Sutter
General Hospital.
   His wife, Diana Nida, received a superficial wound in the hand
during the attack and was treated and released from University
Medical Center.
   Neighbors said they watched horrified as the man fatally stabbed
the girl with a 10-inch knife in the driveway, then apologized to
her.
   When police arrived, they found four stabbed children lying in
the living room. Officers were attacked by a pit bull dog, which
they shot.
   Eight-year-old Laura Nida died at the medical center a short time
later, police said. April, 4, and John and Erick, 7-year-old twins,
were listed in critical condition Saturday night following surgery
for multiple stab wounds.
   Police said neighbors had indicated that Nida might have been
under the influence of drugs, though they gave no details. The
Sacramento Bee quoted neighbors as saying that Nida often used
crack, amphetamines, marijuana and alcohol.
   Shortly after the attack began, Mrs. Nida ran out of the house,
naked and bleeding, and screaming ``He stabbed my babies and he cut
me!'', witnesses said.
   Neighbor Terry Lauer said Nida emerged through the front door and
approached his wife, saying: ``It's OK, man, I just want to talk to
her.'' Lauer said he told him to go back into the house, and Nida
did.
   Moments later, however, he ran from the front door again, this
time chasing the 8-year-old girt with what Lauer described as a
bowie knife.
   ``He caught up with her and they both ended up on the ground,''
Lauer said. ``I saw him pick her up by the hair, then stab her twice
with the knife. Her body went limp.''
   Lauer said Nida then knelt over his daughter, cradling her body
in his arms. ``I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you,'' Lauer
recalled Nida saying. Nica then carried the lifeless girl back into
the house.

   President Fidel Castro of Cuba said Saturday
that he hopes President-elect George Bush will be more pragmatic
than his predecessor in recognizing Latin American realities.
   ``It's always better to deal with a pragmatic man than to deal
with a man like President Reagan, who has a mind from the last
century, if that doesn't offend the last century,'' said Castro at a
news conference.
   But he said he he could not speculate on any changes in the
abrasive relationship between the United States and communist Cuba
under the new Bush administration.
   ``They say Bush is more pragmatic and less ideological than
Reagan,'' said Castro. ``But we'll have to see what happens and how
the new administration behaves.''
   Castro said his visit here for the inauguration of Carlos Salinas
de Gortari as president of Mexico is a sign that the United States'
long-term policy of isolating Cuba has fallen apart.
   ``Thirty years have gone by, and we're still here,'' he said.
Castro's forces overthrew the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista on
Jan. 1, 1959. Castro noted that most countries in Latin America had
joined attempts to isolate Cuba.
   ``We never came to an inauguration before because they didn't
invite us,'' said Castro. ``But now Ecuador and Mexico have invited
us. U.S. policy is a total wreck, and Cuba's position is being
vindicated by Latin America.''
   He said he had met with Colombian president Virgilio Barco during
the Salinas festivities because ``although we don't have diplomatic
relations, we do have real relations.''
   ``We have never changed,'' he declared. ``But now, the situation
has changed.''
   He said he hopes the incoming Bush administration accepts the
reality of Latin America's staggering foreign debt problems and that
any agreement on the debt is the result of negotiation.
   ``It's not a small problem, like Grenada,'' said Castro. ``They
won't be able to resolve the problems created by the debt with the
82nd Airborne.''
   He said the Reagan administration's Central American policy had
failed in Nicaragua, El Salavador and Panama.
   ``One of the first tests of the Bush administration's pragmatic
spirit will be whether they are ready to negotiate with Nicaragua,''
he said.
   ``As far as Salvador is concerned, the test will be whether they
want to look for a solution by military means or by political
means.''
   Also during the three-hour news conference, Castro lashed out at
the South Africans, saying they ``aren't serious'' about peace in
their region.
   Talks aimed at a pullout of Cuban troops from Angola and
independence for South African-ruled Namibia broke off Saturday
without an agreement.
   Castro said more negotiations are needed, adding, ``If we have to
stay there another ten years, we will.''

<TEXT>
   The military flight of space shuttle
Atlantis continued today with its usual official silence as the
public heard no word about the spaceship or its five crewmen.
   The silence results from a Defense Department policy to reveal as
little as possible about military shuttle missions.
   But no news was good news, for NASA and the Air Force said they
would break the silence only if a major problem developed.
   There was no information on whether the crew accomplished its
main goal: deploying a powerful all-weather radar satellite designed
to gather extremely sharp images of Eastern Bloc military
facilities. It would help American intelligence officials monitor
Soviet compliance with arms treaties.
   The satellite eventually will serve as the ``radar eye'' for the
new B-2 stealth bomber, picking out potential targets. That will
eliminate the need for the aircraft to use its own radar, which
might disclose its location.
   The astronauts were to release the satellite, with the code name
Lacrosse, on Saturday, reliable sources reported before the flight.
   The sources also said the astronauts were to conduct several
experiments aimed at defining man's role as a military observer in
space, with reconnaissance a high priority. It was believed they
would test a special optical device that resembles binoculars.
   The crew members are Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson, the commander;
Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner, the pilot; Col. Richard M.
Mullane and Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross of the Air Force, and Navy Cmdr.
William M. Shepherd.
   The flight, which began Friday with a blazing liftoff from Cape
Canaveral, is expected to end Monday or Tuesday, with a landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration planned to
announce the landing time 24 hours in advance.

<HEAD>Civilian Evacuations Ordered As New Units Reported In Rebellion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM H. HEATH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities today ordered
civilians evacuated from a neighborhood surrounding a rebel
stronghold in this capital as new military units were reported to
have joined the insurrection.
   Troop and tank movement was reported in several areas near Buenos
Aires as army loyalists apparently prepared to obey President Raul
Alfonsin's order to suppress the three-day revolt. Backup troops
also were reported being flown in from Neuquen, 750 miles southwest.
   It is the third army uprising since April 1987 and the latest
challenge to the civilian government since it restored democracy in
1983 after a nearly eight-year military dictatorship in which at
least 9,000 suspected leftists vanished without a trace.
   Mayor Carlos Brown of suburban San Martin was quoted by local
news agencies as saying he had received orders to evacuate all
civilians from the area surrounding a unit taken over Saturday by
about 500 rebels headed by Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin.
   Police, firemen and civil defense volunteers began evacuating the
working-class residential area this morning.
   Reporters outside the 10th Logistical Batallion told local news
agenices the rebels appeared to fortifying their defense and had
moved a tank into position blocking the entrance.
   Alfonsin, as armed forces commander, sent a message to all
military units early today asking them to ``be alert to violent
options of some groups that march against history and hide their
real goals.''
   Although the majority of units throughout the country maintained
their loyalty, the official news agency Telam reported the 6th
Infantry Regiment in Mercedes, 62 miles west of the capital, had
joined the revolt led by Seineldin.
   The independent news agency Noticias Argentinas reported the 4th
Paratroop Brigade near Cordoba, 470 miles northwest, also joined the
insurrection.
   The government and political leaders called on Argentines to
demonstrate in town plazas across the country in favor of democracy
and in repudiation of the rebels. More than 100,000 were reported to
have filled plazas in Buenos Aires and Rosario, some staying
overnight.
   Sporadic shootings were reported overnight at Campo de Mayo, the
nation's largest army base on the outskirts of Buenos Aires where
Seineldin first took over an infantry school early Friday. There
were no reports of injuries.
   Four soldiers have been injured since the uprising began. Three
soldiers were wounded by a mine blast in January during a similar
army rebel uprising in Monte Caseros, 520 miles northeast of Buenos
Aires.
   Although surrounded, outgunned and outmanned by loyal troops, the
rebels were able to board trucks Saturday afternoon and drive
unhindered to the unit in the Villa Martelli neighborhood of San
Martin.
   Several explosions were heard Saturday night inside the
rebel-held unit, where angry civilians shouted insults and threw
rocks at troops wearing combat gear and camouflage paint.
   A bomb, tossed from a moving car, exploded but caused no damage
or injuries outside the 5th Infantry Brigade in northern Tucuman,
Telam reported.
   Alfonsin, who spent the night in the heavily guarded Government
House in downtown Buenos Aires, said Saturday night in a nationwide
radio and television address that he had ordered the army to
``suffocate'' the revolt.
   The army chief of staff, Gen. Jose Dante Caridi, simultaneously
issued a communique accusing Seineldin of trying to impose
``inadmisable conditions'' that endanger the constitution.
   The rebels, the army said, want ``changes in the government and
national authorities, the removal of the army chief of staff and his
replacement by a general picked by them,'' as well as the right to
select other high-ranking officers.
   The rebels earlier had also demanded an end to prosecution of
officers for human rights abuses committed during the dictatorship
and had sought an increase in the army's budget, trimmed as part of
the austerity measures taken by a government battling an annual
inflation rate of 330 percent.

   Alaska's biggest city is host to a moose
convention, only the conventioneers aren't the type who wear red
fezzes and nametags.
   Anchorage this fall is brimming with moose _ the animal type _
perhaps 900 of them, or 100 more than the total that feasted on
urban shrubbery two years ago, said the state Department of Fish and
Game.
   Moose are striding over cars, moseying around back yards and
chewing up mountain ash trees. The animals are bulling their way
through traffic, nosing around fast-food franchises and hanging
around a synagogue.
   ``We got a pot full o' moose around here,'' said state game
biologist Mike McDonald.
   The problem could get worse in the next two months, when moose
from the Chugach foothills make their move into the city to escape
the snow build-up at higher elevations, McDonald said.
   McDonald said the moose population has been helped by mild
winters the past two years. ``They pumped out calves like I can't
believe,'' McDonald said.
   Earlier this week, police said they watched a big bull moose
stroll across a parking lot and begin to step gingerly over a new
Pontiac. The moose dropped a hind foot and dented the hood.
   Then there's the cow and calf who live in a park across the
street from Temple Beth Sholom. Rabbi Harry Rosenfeld said they
visit nearly every night to munch on the synagogue's fruit trees or
peer through windows at services.

   Police are cracking down on railroad
engineers who can't keep it down at night.
   Officers have begun ticketing engineers who blast their horns as
they travel through downtown in violation of a city noise ordinance.
   Officials of the Chicago & North Western and the Cedar Rapids and
Iowa City railroads, whose engineers were ticketed last week, said
horns must be sounded at crossings, despite the hour, to warn
pedestrians and motorists.
   City officials want railroads to use discretion between 10 p.m.
and 7 a.m. if no pedestrians or vehicles are nearby.
   After negotiations broke down last week, police were ordered to
ticket engineers who were deemed to have sounded horns
unnecessarily. ``Maybe we can do a little more negotiations now,''
Streets Commissioner Wayne Murdock said Friday.
   Murdock said the issue is a sore point at the Stouffer's Five
Seasons Hotel, where guests frequently are jolted from sleep in the
wee hours.
   ``I've seen ads from another hotel saying `Stay here, where you
don't have to worry about the trains,''' Murdock said.

   The brass bells that herald the annual
Salvation Army Christmas kettle drive are in a long-term decline.
   The Salvation Army said an increasingly busy, impersonal world
has depleted the number of volunteers willing to stand in the cold
to drum up donations.
   Col. Leon Ferraez, spokesman at the Salvation Army's national
headquarters in Verona, N.J., said that nationwide, about 42,000
volunteers hit the streets for last year's kettle drive, which
generated about $27 million.
   The number this year is up slightly to 45,000, thanks to the
opening of new shopping malls that have agreed to provide space, but
Ferraez said that's a far cry from the early 1960s, when some
100,000 volunteers were out ringing bells.
   Despite the drop in volunteers, Ferraez predicted about $30
million will be collected this year.
   Maj. David Brindley, Salvation Army area coordinator for
Columbus, said it is now a rare day that more than half the 100
collection spots in the city are manned.
   ``Everybody has his own agenda,'' said Brindley, who recalled
when most volunteers were willing to put in 10-hour days every day
for a week or two. Most workers now log one- and two-hour shifts.
   ``This is really an aberration of the last generation. Most of
our volunteers are busily engaged in earning a living. The biggest
decrease has been among what was always our largest workforce _
women. They've got jobs now and have to make ends meet, too.''
   The Salvation Army, operating in 90 countries, was founded 123
years ago to help the poor in England by former Methodist minister
William Booth.
   Those likely to volunteer these days are members of civic groups,
college students and those who have received or are seeking help
from the Salvation Army. The latter two groups are the only bell
ringers who get paid.
   ``It's only minimum wage, but we feel that paying them for their
time will help those who can't afford to have a real Christmas,''
Ferraez said. ``College students who need the money to get through
school get paid too.''

   A handshake and promises were all that
sealed the more than $41 million settlement between 44 victims, 92
attorneys and over 40 companies in the L'Ambiance Plaza building
collapse before it was filed in court.
   That may have indicated the confidence the parties had in the
case's chief mediator, U.S. District Judge Robert C. Zampano.
   ``Obviously this (settlement) is the closest thing to the eighth
wonder of the world in the court's point of view,'' said U.S.
District Judge T.F. Gilroy Daly. ``All of us refer cases to him
(Zampano). He has extraordinary patience.''
   The settlement, signed Thursday, stemmed from the April 23, 1987,
collapse of a partially completed apartment complex in Bridgeport.
Twenty-eight men were killed and 16 injured.
   Claimants blamed the accident on lift-slab construction, in which
pre-cast concrete floors are hoisted into place.
   Zampano said there could have been hundreds of lawsuits and
thousands of counterclaims from the tragedy, and experts said it
could have taken 10 to 15 years for the lawsuits to go through the
court system.
   The mediation involved federal, state and probate courts, the
federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the state
Workers' Compensation Commission.
   ``We just took it one day at a time,'' Zampano said in an
interview Friday.
   Daly said Zampano is known for settling difficult cases out of
court and has a gift for listening in a ``kindly'' manner and
hearing what both sides really say.
   ``Everyone knows if Zampano takes a look at it ... if he can't do
it (mediate a settlement), I don't know who can,'' Daly said.
   Zampano, 59, is a graduate of Yale Law School and a former U.S.
attorney who began practicing law in 1954. He has been on the bench
for nearly 25 years.
   The L'Ambiance case was his most complex, he said. The months of
negotiations sometimes occurred on weekends, holidays and at night.
Zampano also handled his own cases during that time.
   He said he felt a twing of fear two days before Thanksgiving when
he realized no one had signed anything.
   ``It was all done by handshake. I thought what if someone said,
`I didn't promise you $3 million, I said $300,000,''' Zampano said.
``But nobody did.''
   In June, he and the other member of the mediation panel, Superior
Court Judge Frank S. Meadow, interviewed the victims' families. He
said it was the saddest month of his life. The case was like going
to 28 wakes and 28 funerals, he said.
   ``You just can't meet parties who suffered such great losses
without it being heart-wrenching,'' he said.
   Four months ago, an appraiser told him that the land on which the
building collapsed wasn't worth as much as it should be because of
the stigma. Under the settlement, the building will be
reconstructed, with some profits going to the victims.
   ``That has turned right around,'' Zampano said. ``Developers are
calling me and saying they want to be a part of it. Four months ago,
it was a monument to death, now it's a monument to life.''
   On Thursday, more than 200 people crowded into Zampano's
courtroom to watch the filing of the settlement.
   ``It took a person with his exceptional skills to accomplish
this,'' said U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr. ``A lot of judges
refer cases to him. He brings the parties together and works them
back and forth.''
   ``We negotiate every day in life, when buying a car or a house,''
Zampano said. ``But for some reason when people get in a lawsuit the
general feeling is we'll fight to the finish.
   ``But when we bring them in, they really don't want to go to
court. If you can bring both sides in, sit down and rationally talk
it out, more than 95 percent of the cases should be settled.''

<HEAD>`Lost' George Orwell Play Turns Up 56 Years Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 13-year-old boy who tucked away the script of a
school play written by his teacher unwittingly preserved the only
known copy of a drama by author George Orwell, the Sunday Times
reported.
   The short historical drama, entitled ``King Charles II,'' about
the king's flight to France after his father's execution will be
auctioned by Sotheby's in London on Dec. 15, the weekly said.
   Orwell wrote the play while teaching at the private Hawthorns
high school in Hayes outside London in 1932, the year before he
changed his name from Eric Blair with the publication of his first
book, ``Down and Out in Paris and London.''
   Geoffrey Stevens, a retired construction merchant, told the
newspaper it was not until many years later that he realized his
teacher at Hawthorns was the famous author of ``Animal Farm'' and
``1984'' and that he had pocketed a literary treasure.
   ``He was Mr. Blair and that was how we knew him,'' Stevens was
quoted as saying. ``Of course, I had heard of George Orwell much
later. I just never realized they were one and the same until I was
reading an article about him and saw his photograph.
   ``I always thought there was something special about him _ a
lofty teacher who seemed in a world of his own,'' he was quoted as
saying. ``I don't know why I preserved his play. I suppose I liked
him enormously and I keep most things. I'm glad I did.''
   The school play idea was used in Orwell's second novel, ``A
Clergyman's Daughter,'' the newspaper said.
   Stevens is selling the typescript acting copy, on which his first
name is written twice in red crayon, it said.
   According to the auction house catalog, Sotheby's estimates the
play will fetch between $2,775 and $3,700.

   A group of girls has gone on strike in a village
in south China, refusing to do housework, tend the fields or take
care of their siblings unless their parents let them attend school,
according to a report seen Sunday.
   ``We want to go to school and study,'' one of the 14 girls was
quoted as saying. ``And if our families won't let us, we'll make
trouble. If we don't win this one, our lives will be finished.'' Her
name was not provided.
   The Communist Party newspaper the Peasant Daily said the girls,
between 8 and 15 years old, are fighting an antiquated Chinese
tradition which holds that education is for men only.
   But they are also battling recent economic changes that have made
education more costly for many peasant families.
   ``Most of the girls from Jia Cui village aren't allowed to go to
school,'' said the report about the village in Guangxi province.
``Those few that do go only make it to the third or fourth grade.''
   China's education system faces a shortage of funds as the cost of
books, electricity, food and other services has soared due to rising
inflation.
   As a result, many schools have started levying fees,
contradicting an official policy of free education for all.
   In the cities, teams of workers often pay these fees, but in the
countryside individual households are often stuck with the bill. So
peasant families tend to send their boys to school and keep their
girls at home.
   In this way, China's new economic difficulties are reinforcing
old sexual distinctions that kept women uneducated and bound to the
home.
   Indeed, an official study released earlier this year said that
women make up 64 percent of the illiterates in China.
   In addition, it said that girls comprise 83 percent of the
country's 2.7 million school-aged children who have not yet started
school.
   The newspaper report, published Saturday, said many meetings have
been held in the village to persuade families to let their children
go to school.
   ``Last semester, a teacher even started night classes for
girls,'' the paper said, ``but night classes need lamp oil and no
families would give any. The classes lasted one month and then
folded.''
   The paper quoted the mother of one of the strikers as saying she
opposed her daughter's action.
   ``Girls have got to marry early. If they don't stay at home and
learn to do labor and craft work now, they won't marry well later
on,'' the mother said.
   So far, eight of the girls have been allowed to go to school. The
others are waiting for the village to set up another night class,
the paper said.

<HEAD>Staff Of Yugoslav Consulate Leaves Australia Under Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Complying with an order from the
Australian government, Yugoslavia closed its consulate Sunday and
called its staff home, including a security guard accused of
shooting a demonstrator.
   The departure of 12-member staff and their families ended a
standoff between the two nations that began last week when the guard
allegedly shot and wounded a teen-ager during a Croatian
demonstration outside the consulate.
   Australia ordered the consulate closed after it refused to allow
Australian authorities to question the guard.
   Yugoslavia protested the order expelling the diplomats and
claimed that the guard fired in self-defense when demonstrators
charged the consulate and Australian authorities were unable to stop
them.
   Security was tight Sunday when police escorted cars carrying the
Yugoslavs from the consulate in the Sydney suburb of Woollahra to
the airport, where they departed on a Yugoslav Airlines flight
Sunday night.
   More than 100 police guarded the airport, but an expected
demonstration by Croatians failed to occur.
   The Australian government has reserved the right to claim
compensation from Yugoslav officials for the family of Jospeh Tokic,
16, who was shot in the throat during the protest on Nov. 27,
Yugoslav National Day.
   Yugoslav authorities said the guard, identified as Matijas Zoran,
fired in self-defense when several Croatian youths began scaling the
consulate walls. Croatians are among several ethnic groups in
Yugoslavia.
   About 200,000 Yugoslavs live in Australia.
   Yugoslavia strongly criticized Australia on Saturday for closing
the consulate and expelling its staff, but did not did not threaten
to retaliate.

<HEAD>In Time Of Change, The House Is Bastion of Stability</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a year in which the White House will have a
new occupant and the Senate will be under new leadership, the House
of Representatives promises to be a bastion of stability.
   House Democrats and Republicans meet this week to elect their
leaders and appear likely to return most of the top positions to the
same hands, including House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas and Minority
Leader Robert Michel of Illinois.
   Wright's ethics problems _ he is being investigated for alleged
financial improprieties and on charges he improperly disclosed
classified information _ have stirred some unease among Democrats,
but do not appear to have threatened his leadership position.
   Other top Democrats in the group that took power in 1987 will
also retain their posts: Thomas Foley of Washington as majority
leader, Tony Coelho of California as majority whip and David Bonior
of Michigan as Coelho's chief deputy.
   ``There's no question, the team is together,'' Coehlo said. ``It
worked together for two years... I think that we had an excellent
two years, very, very productive.
   ``You had a speaker who set an agenda,'' in marked contrast to
that of President Reagan and managed to wrest control over much of
U.S. policy, Coehlo said.
   The only real battle on the Democratic side, when the votes are
cast Monday behind the closed doors of the House chamber, will be
for the chairmanship of the House Democratic Caucus, the policy
organization of all House Democrats. The position holds no real
powers, but it can be used as a platform for gaining visibility, as
it did for its previous occupant, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., is seen by many as the favorite to win
the post after campaigning hard all year and spending more than
$115,000 on campaign contributions to fellow Democrats, including 99
members of the 101st Congress.
   His chief opponent, Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, has charged
that Gray's effort has improperly injected big money into an
internal House race for the first time. Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla.,
also is seeking the post.
   Either Gray or Oakar, now the vice chairman of the caucus, would
be trailblazers for the Democrats.
   Gray would be the first black to gain a rung on the House
administrative leadership ladder that can lead to the speaker's job.
He is completing the maximum four years as Budget Committee
chairman. A win for Oakar would make her the first woman to break
into the party's top leadership.
   Michel is unopposed for minority leader, the top Republican
leadership position he has held for the past eight years.
   There will be a shift in the No. 2 slot for the GOP, as
Republican Conference chairman Dick Cheney of Wyoming moves up to be
minority whip, a post vacated by Mississippi's Trent Lott as he
moves over to the Senate.
   The only fight on the Republican side is over who will succeed
Cheney as conference chairman.
   Normally, the heir apparent would be Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif.,
who has been the party's policy committee chairman. But he faces a
stiff challenge from Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois, a quick,
outspoken lawmaker who has been conference vice chairman. Also
running for the post is Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif.
   The House meetings come a week after the Senate informally
convened to get organized for the coming year and Democrats elected
Sen. George Mitchell of Maine to succeed West Virginia's Robert Byrd
as majority leader.
   In their meetings, House Democrats also will consider a list of
proposed rules changes, including one proposed by Rep. Charles
Stenholm, D-Texas, to force disclosure of who would benefit from
special-interest provisions in legislation.
   The proposal would require the listing of the name of each
beneficiary, the cost to taxpayers of the provision, and the name of
the lawmaker who sponsored it. The aim is to prevent members of
Congress who vote for a bill from later being embarrassed by
discovery of special-interest provisions.
   Stenholm's suggestion was considered by a leadership panel, which
declined to support it on grounds that it would impose unreasonable
burdens on committees, particularly the tax and spending panels
which most frequently deal with special-interest measures.

   Lee Thomas says he was proud to be leading the
``tree-huggers'' _ the nickname for people who put environmental
concerns above all else _ out of the closet at the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   Concern for natural resources _ swamps, endangered species, green
and furry things _ ``is not something to be looked down on,'' Thomas
said in an interview marking the close of his nearly four years as
administrator of the government's largest regulatory agency.
   It isn't widely recognized that the laws guiding EPA are heavily
aimed at protecting health. In the agency, ``We had lost the sense
we had both missions, and that one was connected to the other,''
Thomas said.
   ``If you don't protect wetlands, you're eventually going to have
major problems in water quality _ eventually that translates into
health issues.''
   To a remark that the agency sometimes seemed ``full of closet
tree-huggers,'' Thomas replied with emphasis, ``As it should be.''
It was clear Thomas was refusing to accept the term as one of
derision.
   Asked which accomplishments he is proud of, the first concrete
actions he lists are the little-noticed establishment of a Wetlands
Office in EPA and a program focusing protection of estuaries, the
wide mouths of rivers where the tide meets the fresh water.
   Ahead of those he lists an intangible achievement, the
establishment of U.S. leadership in international discussions of
global climate change.
   Thomas was not known as a tree-hugger of any variety when he came
to EPA.
   He has degrees in education and psychology and was a family-court
probation officer before becoming director of public safety in the
South Carolina governor's office, where his duties included
management of emergencies.
   He came to Washington in 1981 as associate director of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. He directed flood relief
efforts in 1982 at the dioxin-contaminated town of Times Beach, Mo.,
later supervising the federal buyout of residents' homes.
   Success attracted White House attention. President Reagan
nominated him as assistant EPA administrator to oversee the
superfund toxic waste cleanup program, succeeding the fired Rita
Lavelle early in 1983.
   He was to have been part of a team of managers the White House
sent in to shape up an agency in turmoil over accusations of
political manipulation of superfund.
   Impressed with what he saw as rare administrative selflessness
and openness, EPA administrator William D. Ruckelshaus recommended
Thomas as his successor when he resigned in late 1984.
   Thomas has been there ever since in a job he calls ``the best job
in Washington ... and the worst,'' one that leaves the holder
``aware of the fact you're not going to get any `Attaboys!' from any
side.''
   Thomas is leaving without any idea what he will do next.
   His biggest disappointment, he said, was the failure of Congress
to decide what to do about the 68 cities and rural counties that
failed to meet federal air quality standards for ozone at the 1987
deadline.
   ``We're kind of in limbo,'' he said.
   The debate over the Clean Air Act, according to some in Congress,
illustrates what they say is Thomas' big shortcoming.
   ``He was cooperative, but we got no leadership out of the White
House when we absolutely needed it,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla.,
chairman of the environment and natural resources subcommittee of
the House Government Operations Committee.
   ``Lee Thomas is very sharp, well-respected, knowledgeable on the
issues, and no question about it, very bright. He has continued to
restore the credibility of the agency ... but he doesn't have
political clout down at the White House.''
   Peter A.A. Berle, president of the National Audubon Society,
makes a similar but more favorable assessment: ``He has struggled
mightily, in some areas successfully and in some areas not so
successfully. He has had practically no support from the White
House. ... I would have hoped he would have cut through some of the
bureaucracy around superfund.''
   In the agency, Thomas is considered a bureaucrat's bureaucrat,
and it's a bureaucrat's improvement he suggests _ for Congress.
   Congress, he said, ``ought to step back and look at their
organizational arrangements for dealing with EPA.'' With 75
committees and subcommittees, according to the agency's count,
claiming a piece of the action, ``they just don't have the structure
to do any kind of priority setting.''
   ``The interest groups say, `I want it done my way and the only
way I can make sure it's done my way is to have it written into the
law.''
   Even though Congress spells out details such as how many
superfund investigations must be completed by specific dates, Thomas
believes it sometimes shies away from what should be the major point.
   In the last session's clean air debates, Thomas said he never got
a clear answer from members to the question, ``Are you willing to
say a maximum individual risk (of cancer) of one in 10,000 is OK
because the alternative is to shut the plant down? That's a decision
I have to make.''

   Motorists in New York are bracing for
``Gorbylock'' _ traffic jams of superpower proportions during
Mikhail Gorbachev's visit this week.
   ``But remember: It's gridlock for the sake of world peace,'' said
Samuel Schwartz, deputy transportation commissioner.
   The Soviet leader is scheduled to arrive Tuesday. He will meet
with President Reagan and Vice President George Bush on Governor's
Island on Wednesday, tour the city on Thursday and leave Friday.
   Among the possibilities are visits to the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, Times Square and Wall Street. Gorbachev will travel in a
heavily guarded, 40-car motorcade.
   ``If he goes through Times Square, we expect he might get out of
his car to shake hands,'' said Alice McGillion, a police
spokeswoman. ``It's a movable riot.''
   Wednesday and Thursday are expected to be the worst days for
traffic. In addition to the Christmas shopping rush, Wednesday is
matinee day on Broadway, which can add 50,000 vehicles to the
860,000 that normally enter Manhattan.
   ``Dec. 7 will be a day of infamy,'' Schwartz said.
   ``We're advising motorists to go public, take public
transportation. The easiest way to get around will be to walk.
Certain areas may have to be frozen as the Soviet leader moves
about.''

<HEAD>12 Winners In Record $45 Million New York Lottery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve lottery tickets bear the magic numbers
entitling the holders to a share of a record $45 million-plus
jackpot so enticing that an estimated eight out of 10 New York
adults tried their luck, officials said Sunday.
   The holders of the $1 Lotto tickets beat odds of nearly 13
million to 1 in winning the jackpot, the biggest in the 12-year
history of the state lottery.
   The jackpot could go higher, when sales are finally tabulated,
said lottery spokesman George Yamin.
   Each ticket was worth $3.75 million, meaning each ticket holder
will receive $142,857 after taxes each year for the next 20 years.
The jackpot could be claimed immediately at lottery offices, which
were specially opened Sunday.
   Acting Lottery Director Russell Gladieux said 37.4 million
tickets sold in the frenzy leading up to Saturday night's drawing,
going at about 28,000 a minute.
   ``Our best estimate, based on past studies, is that when we get a
jackpot this high, 80 percent of (adult) New York residents play,''
said Gladieux.
   The winning tickets all were bought in the New York metropolitan
area. ``I don't know how I'm going to explain that to the upstate
press,'' Gladieux said.
   The jackpot rose from $26 million after no one won Wednesday's
drawing.
   The biggest previous jackpot awarded in New York was $41 million
in 1985, divided among three tickets, one held by 21 factory
workers. The largest single winner in New York took received a $30.5
million jackpot in 1986.
   The world's biggest lottery jackpot, $61.98 million, was divided
among three winning tickets in California in October. The largest
single winner in history was a Florida woman who claimed $55.16
million in September.
   The winning numbers Saturday in New York's Lotto game were: 1, 8,
13, 18, 28, 48. The supplemental number was 19.

<HEAD>Bhutto Cabinet With ex-Zia Foreign Minister To Continue Afghan
Policy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
installed her Cabinet on Sunday, holding the defense and finance
portfolios for herself and naming a foreign minister who served
under the late President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   The moves followed her orders Saturday to free political
prisoners convicted under martial law and commute all death
sentences. Those orders are expected to be acted on by President
Ghulam Ishaq Khan.
   In a news conference, Ms. Bhutto said the appointment of
Sahabzada Yaqub Khan to head the Foreign Ministry is a signal of
continuity in Pakistan's stand on the war in neighboring Afghanistan.
   Pakistan, with help from the United States, supports Moslem
anti-communist guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed Kabul
government and shelters more than 3 million Afghan war refugees.
   Despite her bitter opposition to Zia, Ms. Bhutto said during her
election campaign that she would maintain his Afghan policy until
the fighting stops and the refugees feel safe to go home.
   Zia died in an Aug. 17 plane crash, weeks after approving
elections for Pakistan. Authorities suspect sabotage in the crash,
which also killed U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 others. A
probe is continuing.
   Ms. Bhutto, who took the oath of office Friday, stocked her
government with stalwarts of her Pakistan People's Party except for
Yaqub Khan.
   All 10 Cabinet ministers and seven ministers of state, the second
echelon in rank, took the oath of office Sunday administered by
Ishaq Khan.
   Although she assigned no ministers for defense or finance, Ms.
Bhutto appointed special advisers with the rank of minister.
   She named Yahya Bakhtiar as attorney general, the same post he
held in the 1970s under her father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto. It was Zia who overthrew Bhutto in 1977. Bhutto was hanged
two years later after his conviction for conspiring to kill a
political rival.
   Pakistan, the United States, Afghanistan and the Soviet Union
signed a U.N.-mediated accord in April in which Moscow promised to
withdraw all of its more than 100,000 combat troops from Afghanistan
between last May 15 and next Feb. 15.
   About half have already left, but the pullout is temporarily
stalled because the communists claim Islamabad is violating the pact
by continuing to arm the rebels.
   Pakistan claims it is entitled to, because Washington and Moscow
also agreed to continue supplying their respective clients in the
10-year war until the other side stops.
   In her first official act as prime minister, Ms. Bhutto, 35,
called Saturday for the release of about 1,000 political prisoners
convicted under Zia's martial law.
   In a recommendation to the president, she also called for the
commutation of all death sentences and the release of all female
prisoners except those convicted of murder.
   Ishaq Khan did not immediately respond but Ahssan, the new law
minister, said the president was required to act on the advice of
the prime minister.

   Police are puzzled by a rash of 14
homicides in the 10 days since Thanksgiving in the Twin Cities area,
considered one of the safest metropolitan areas in the country.
   ``It's very strange,'' said Sgt. Marvin Rorvick of the
Minneapolis homicide unit, which is investigating seven deaths in
two arson fires Nov. 26 and 27. ``We go months without any murders,
and all of a sudden there's a burst. It's hard to understand why.''
   Fifty-six homicides have been recorded in Minneapolis this year,
already breaking the record of 48 in 1975 and 1986. In 1987, 46
homicides were recorded.
   In St. Paul, two stabbings and two stranglings in the past week
boosted to 18 the number of homicides in St. Paul in 1988, six more
than all of last year, but fewer than the record of 20 in 1985, said
police spokesman Paul Adelmann.
   Three other homicides in the latest rash occurred in Bloomington
and Hopkins.
   ``I don't have an explanation for it,'' said Lt. Russell Bovee,
head of the St. Paul homicide division. ``But we don't need anymore.
The recent string of murders has put a tremendous strain on our
manpower. I've got people in the street with very little sleep.''
   ``I think what you have is coincidence,'' said Peter Parilla, a
sociologist at the College of St. Thomas with expertise in
criminology. ``These are isolated incidents. As a general rule, I
wouldn't say there's cause for concern.''
   According to FBI figures for 1986, Minnesota's major crime rate
per 100,000 people was 2.5, compared with 10.7 for New York, 11.3
for Michigan and California, and 11.7 for Florida.
   The underlying pattern of violence in society is the only link
between the murders, said Kathleen Alme, director of the Crime
Victim Center in Minneapolis. ``Many people feel the need to solve
problems that way,'' she said.

   A government decree published Sunday bans

   The Interior Ministry said the decision was taken because the
work of men in the profession ``is contradictory to the profound
values of the nation and its authenticity,'' according to government

   Most Iraqis are Moslems and the Islamic religion forbids men and
women to mingle in public unless the women are veiled.

<HEAD>House Study Sees Surprise Soviet Strike in Europe Unlikely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is highly unlikely to launch a
sudden military attack on NATO forces in Europe, despite fears of
western military leaders about a Pearl Harbor-type strike, a
congressional study said Sunday.
   The Soviets don't have enough well-trained forces to mount such a
strike and would likely be detected by western intelligence
officials if they tried to prepare, concluded the review by the
House Armed Services defense policy panel.
   Soviet forces along the front with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization countries are generally maintained at a lower level of
readiness to fight than their NATO counterparts, the study said.
   Even the best-prepared Soviet troops ``would take at least a week
before they were ready for offensive combat action,'' said the
study, which was based on closed-door hearings by the panel last
fall.
   ``The Soviets apparently do not believe they can best achieve
their goals by virtue of a surprise attack that defeats NATO in a
very few days,'' it said.
   ``Although NATO can never completely discount the possibility of
a standing start surprise attack, the Soviets are apparently not
preparing for such an attack,'' the study concluded.
   The Soviets would face similar problems if they tried to prepare
an attack with longer lead times of several weeks, permitting
greater mobilization, the study said.
   The study cited three instances in which it said the Soviets took
lengthy amounts of time to prepare for armed action _ the Soviet
military action in Afghanistan, the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia,
and the 1980 Polish crisis.
   The possibility of a sneak attack, similar to the type mounted by
Japan on Dec. 7, 1941, against the U.S. Navy in Hawaii, has long
worried NATO planners.
   Most often cited is the fear that the Soviets will attack west
across the German border, where the United States maintains about
250,000 military personnel in West Germany.
   ``NATO's ground forces are generally more ready than Warsaw Pact
ground forces,'' the study said.
   The biggest problem for NATO would be if the alliance delays
mobilizing for war in answer to obvious Warsaw Pact preparations,
the study found.
   ``In this case, the Warsaw Pact gains a significant advantage
when it has time to ready its forces for an attack and NATO does not
respond,'' the study said. ``The Pact advantage builds until NATO
mobilizes.
   The Soviets couldn't covertly mobilize because NATO intelligence
would spot the preparations, the study said.
   ``The much more likely way the Warsaw Pact could obtain a
mobilization advantage is by a NATO failure to respond to warning,''
it said. ``The real question for NATO is whether NATO decision
makers would respond to warning and make a timely mobilization
decision. This is a very difficult issue.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the panel, said, ``NATO has
to have the kind of clear, timely warning of Pact war preparations
that will convince the public, particularly in Europe, that
counter-steps have to be taken to prevent war.''
   Such timely warnings could come from arms control agreements
requiring, for example, each side to notify the other about
movements of troops, heavy equipment and the like, Aspin suggested.
   The United States should press for those warnings as part of any
arms control agreement, Aspin said. ``Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev has indicated he wants to back away from military
confrontation in Europe. If he means it, such agreements would be a
significant step in that direction.''
   Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., senior GOP member of the
committee, warned that ``I do not believe we should cavalierly
discount the threat of Soviet surprise attack as a NATO force
planning criterion.''
   The Soviets still maintain a ``very formidable force structure''
and that ``provides planners in Moscow the capabilities they need to
conduct military operations of all types under all scenarios,
including surprise attack if they are so inclined,'' Dickinson said.

   Gunmen attacked a home in Natal
province, killing 11 people and injuring two, police said Sunday.
Authorities also found the body of a man who was slain in a nearby
home.
   Police had no motive for the killings, the latest episode of
black-on-black violence in the province. Nearly 2,000 people have
died in fighting between black political factions in the province's
townships over the past two years.
   Police said an unknown number of blacks knocked on the door of
the home early Saturday morning and began firing when it was opened.
   Three men, six women, a boy and a girl were killed, and two women
were wounded in the attack at Trust Seed, near New Hanover in Natal,
police said.
   The body of a black man with stab wounds was found in another
house nearby, but police did not say whether they believed the two
incidents were related.
   Police gave no other details in their unrest report, a roundup of
violence in South African over the weekend.
   Police said a man was arrested in the black residential area of
Beaufort West in Cape province after the body of a security force
member was found with a stab wound. On Saturday police reported the
stabbing to death of a black soldier by a group of blacks in Ntuzuma
outside Durban. An army spokesman said the dead man was off duty.
   A bomb exploded Sunday at the office of the Home Affairs
Department in Brakpan, a town east of Johannesburg where a newly
elected town council dominated by Conservative Party members
reinstituted segregation of municipal facilities that had been
opened to all races in recent years, police said.
   The small mine exploded at 8:10 a.m. next to an outer wall,
causing damage to windows and doors but no injuries, police said.
   Thousands of blacks who normally spend their end-of-the-month
paychecks shopping on Saturdays stayed away from downtown Boksburg,
the first Conservative-controlled town to reimpose segregation of
parks, the town hall, and public toilets.
   Black residents organized a boycott of the central business
district, where the council says they can shop but can't own
property.
   Leaders of the black and mixed-race townships of Vosloorus and
Reiger Park said arrangements had been made to bus shoppers to other
towns.

   The Israeli navy intercepted a Lebanese fishing
vessel allegedly involved in transporting guerrillas and detained
three crewmen, an army spokesman said Sunday.
   In another development, shelling from the Israel's self-declared
security zone killed one teen-ager in southern Lebanon and wounded
seven others, Lebanese police said.
   The Israeli army spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity
in keeping with army regulations, said the Lebanese vessel was
seized Saturday morning after a routine patrol spotted it near the
southern Lebanese coast.
   He said the boat was identified as a vessel that had been
``recently involved in transporting terrorists between Cyprus and
south Lebanon.''
   The boat was taken to an Israeli naval base, where the three
Lebanese crewmen were being questioned, the army spokesman said. He
gave no other details.
   Police in Lebanon said the boat was a motorboat operated by three
teen-agers, brothers Salah Salim Khalifeh, 16, and Abdul Karim
Khalifeh, 15, and their cousin Hassan Hussein Khalifeh, 17.
   The spokesman said the three were headed south from Sarafand, 15
miles north of Tyre.
   The last Israeli interception of a Lebanese boat was in
mid-September, when the navy seized a rubber dinghy near the
Palestinian refugee camp of Rachadiye in south Lebanon, about 11
miles north of the Israeli border.
   In southern Lebanon, a police spokesman said gunners from
positions of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army shelled the town
of Nabatiyeh for more than two hours Sunday.
   A 14-year-old girl was killed, said the spokesman, who could not
be further identified under briefing rules.
   Israel established its security zone in southern Lebanon after
withdrawing the bulk of its forces in June 1985 following a
three-year invasion.

<HEAD>Herd Tries To Save Wounded Calf, Mourns When He Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For two days, a herd of elephants nursed
a wounded elephant calf after nudging him along the road to the
nearest human protection in the forests of eastern India, United
News of India reported Sunday.
   It took the elephants six hours to cover the two miles to their
destination, a forest rangers' office. The staff administered first
aid to the 2-year-old calf, but he later succumbed to head wounds
inflicted by a tiger.
   Tears rolled out of the mother elephant's eyes as the rest of the
herd formed a circle, raised their trunks and trumpeted over the
body.
   UNI said the tale was related by S.G. Ochi, project manager of
forest development in Simlipal National Park in Orissa state, 140
miles west of Calcutta.
   Ochi said the herd of about 25 elephants apparently was grazing
in a grasslands about two 2 miles from the rangers' office when a
tiger tried to seize the calf.
   Devandra Nayak, a tracker for Project Tiger, a government
organization trying to save tigers from extinction, watched the
herd's progress as it brought the calf to the rangers' office. Nayak
said the herd paused intermittently to let the wounded elephant rest.
   When the elephants reached a salt lick near the rangers' office,
the mother elephant picked up a clump of dry grass in her trunk and
fanned flies away from her calf's head wound.
   The elephants apparently thought the proximity of people would
keep the tiger from returning for the kill, UNI said.
   According to the report, as the midday sun shone down and the
heat grew intense, most of the herd sought shelter under some trees
300 feet away. The mother left her calf in search of water.
   The rangers took advantage of the herd's temporary absence to
wash the calf's wound and apply ointment.
   Then the mother returned, chasing the rangers. She sprayed water
on the calf to cool him and kept vigil, with the rest of the herd,
until he died the following day.
   The herd again disappeared, and the staff buried the calf.
   For the next two nights the herd returned and thumped the loose
earth covering the calf's body.
   UNI said the episode occurred recently, but it did not give a
date.

<HEAD>Peres: Ties With Moscow Have ``New Significance'' After Hijacking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Sunday that
the Soviet Union's enthusiastic response to Israel's help in the
return of four hijackers has given ``new significance'' to relations
with Moscow.
   Peres also noted in a radio interview that Israel agreed to the
speedy return of the hijackers to the Soviet Union Saturday after
receiving written assurances they wouldn't face the death penalty.
   ``The Soviets promised us in writing that these people wouldn't
be executed and so there was no point in delaying or complicating
the process,'' he said on Army radio.
   The return of the hijackers ended a drama that began Thursday,
when four armed Soviets seized a busload of school-children in
southern Russia, then traded them for a plane out of the country and
a $3.3 million ransom. The hijackers surrendered shortly after
arriving in Israel Friday evening.
   Peres cited the reaction of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, who personally thanked the chief of an Israeli
consular delegation in Moscow, Aryeh Levine, for Israel's help in
the affair.
   Shevardnadze was the highest ranking Soviet official to meet
Levine since the Israeli delegates arrived in Moscow in July.
   Shevardnadze was quoted by Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel
as expressing to Levine ``the thanks and deep appreciation of the
Soviet government and Soviet people regarding the noble way the
government of Israel has dealt with this barbaric act.''
   Peres said Shevardnadze's gesture was ``almost without precedent
in our relations with the Soviet Union in recent years. I want to
hope this has a significance beyond the event of the day.''
   ``The representations in Israel and Moscow now have a new
significance,'' Peres said. He referred to the Israeli delegation in
Moscow and a Soviet consular delegation that has been in Tel Aviv
since July 1987.
   Levine said on the radio that in his meeting with Shevardnadze,
he told the Soviet leader ``we would be very happy to have more or
less normal relations. Normal is a very acceptable term in the
Soviet Union and I took advantage of this opportunity to use it.''
   The Soviet Union broke diplomatic ties with Israel during the
1967 Middle East War, but has gradually warmed relations over the
last two years, with the exchange of consular delegations and a
liberalization of Jewish emigration permits.
   Israeli newspapers also echoed Peres' hopes that the weekend
hijacking drama, which involved unusual diplomatic exchanges between
the Israeli and Soviet governments, would improve ties with Moscow.
   The daily Haaretz ran a front-page analysis entitled: ``The Plane
Fell Like a Blessing From Heaven.'' An analysis in the daily
Hadashot was headlined: ``Israel Scores Many Points at a Low Price.''
   Eitan Golan, who headed the Israeli police team that questioned
the hijackers, said one of them, whom he did not identify,
threatened to commit suicide if he was returned to the Soviet Union.
   Golan also quoted the hijackers as saying they chose Israel for
asylum because they knew Israel and the Soviet Union lacked
diplomatic ties and they counted on the fact that Israel would not
hand them over.
   Golan said the hijackers seemed nervous but cooperated fully with
investigators.
   ``My impression is that this wasn't the most sophisticated group
in the world,'' he said.

<HEAD>Democrats Looking to Avoid Racial Fight Over Party Chairmanship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While Republican president-elect George Bush
was having a cordial lunch with Jesse Jackson recently, Democrats
were hoping that a contest for their party chairmanship wouldn't
become a racial fight.
   ``If we're not careful and we turn the chairmanship fight into a
racial thing then, yes, we can alienate everybody,'' said Jim
Ruvolo, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party.
   That was a big reason why many Democrats were waiting anxiously
to hear on Monday whether Paul G. Kirk Jr. was willing to seek a
second, four-year term as chairman.
   Kirk, under heavy pressure from party leaders to stay in his job,
planned to announce his decision at a Monday afternoon news
conference.
   At a meeting last month with state Democratic Party leaders, Kirk
indicated his reluctance, saying, ``Four years is a long time and
eight years is twice as long.''
   But the party chairman has received appeals from party leaders,
including the defeated Democratic presidential ticket of Michael
Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, to stay on.
   While Kirk has received near-unanimous praise for the job he has
done the past four years, another reason for the appeals was the
desire to avoid a fight to succeed him that could divide the party
along racial lines.
   Interested in competing for the chairmanship if Kirk does not run
are Ron Brown, a Washington lawyer who was convention manager for
Jackson; Rick Wiener of Michigan, president of the Association of
Democratic State Chairs; and former Reps. James Stanton of Ohio,
James Jones of Oklahoma and Michael Barnes of Maryland.
   Brown, a former party vice chairman, has openly chafed at the
fact that opposition to him is based on his role in the Jackson
campaign.
   ``I think Ron Brown is right when he says he's been around the
Democratic Party longer than Jesse Jackson,'' said Ruvolo, likely to
succeed Wiener as head of the state chairs association.
   All but Brown have said they would bow out of the contest if Kirk
decides to seek another term. Brown has refused to make such a
commitment although of the impact it would have on his plans he has
said if Kirk runs ``obviously it makes it more difficult, obviously
it's less likely.''
   The potential fight for the chairmanship was not the only
Democratic Party contest that could divide over racial lines during
the next year.
   In New York, Mayor Ed Koch, who is up for re-election in 1989,
outraged blacks and many whites during the 1988 presidential primary
campaign when he said supporters of Israel would ``have to be
crazy'' to vote for Jackson.
   Mayoral races in Chicago and Los Angeles also could produce
bitter contests between black and white candidates.
   While the Democrats were trying to avoid battles that could
alienate their most loyal constituency, the Republicans were taking
aim at attracting more black support.
   Bush met with Jackson and said he and the former Democratic
presidential aspirant have a ``relationship that transcends
politics.''
   ``There will be times ... when I will ask for his suggestions,''
Bush said of Jackson. ``He has some very good ideas.''
   In turn, Jackson praised Bush for his ``openness'' and his
willingness ``to discuss a broad range of matters.''
   Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager and the president-elect's
choice to become next Republican Party chairman, said he would make
a special effort in his new post to attract black voters to the GOP.

<HEAD>Swiss Reject Amendment To Limit Number Of Foreigners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swiss voters on Sunday rejected by 2-1 a proposed
constitutional amendment that would have cut the nation's 1 million
foreign residents by almost one third in the next 15 years.
   A referendum proposal to introduce a 40-hour work week also was
decisively turned down.
   Official returns indicated that 67.3 percent of the voters
rejected the immigration measure. The 40-hour work week was turned
down by 65.8 percent of the voters.
   Officials estimated turnout at 50 percent.
   The immigration measure, launched by the small, right-wing
National Action Party, would have reduced the number of foreigners
among Switzerland's 6.5 million people from 1 million to about
700,000 by the year 2004.
   Supporters said this would be achieved by admitting only two new
immigrants for every three foreigners leaving Switzerland.
   The plan also called for sharply cutting the number of foreign
seasonal workers and of people working in Switzerland but living in
France, Italy, West Germany or Austria.
   The government this year reported a record influx of refugees,
many from Third World countries, seeking asylum in Switzerland. More
than 13,000 foreigners were expected to apply for asylum in
Switzerland this year, up about 30 percent from last year.
   National Action claimed the proposed measure would deter
thousands of people from seeking asylum, thus saving money, easing a
housing shortage and reducing environmental burdens.
   The labor proposal, launched by the Swiss Federation of Trade
Unions, called for annual two-hour reductions in the workweek until
all industries reached the 40-hour standard in 1999. The workweek
now averages 42.5 hours, but workers in catering, sales or hospitals
put in 43 to 60 hours.
   The government had urged citizens to reject both draft
amendments, warning of serious economic consequences in a country
already facing a tight labor market.
   Critics said the immigration measure would sap the work force in
the construction and catering industries, forcing businesses to shut
down or move abroad. They also warned of strained relations with the
12-nation European Economic Community, Switzerland's largest trading
partner.
   Employers and the government argued that the proposed labor
legislation would reduce the flexibility of unions and industries to
negotiate the length of the work week. Several industries, including
watchmaking and machinery, have adopted the 40-hour standard or have
pledged to introduce it.
   In Switzerland, more than 100,000 signatures were required to put
the two referendum issues on the ballot.

   A showdown between British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and Belgian and Irish leaders over extradition of
a pro-IRA priest marred a European Economic Community summit and
plunged Anglo-Irish relations to a new low.
   The EEC meeting, which ended Saturday, also displayed strains
over the next big hurdles the 12-nation trade bloc faces _ such a
single tax system and free migration _ as it becomes a huge, single
market by 1992.
   But it was the issue of Patrick Ryan, a Roman Catholic priest who
British authorities charge is linked with a string of Irish
Republican Army bombings, that exploded into some of the angriest
exchanges yet between the fellow West European leaders.
   As with the other big diversion in Rhodes, the presence of Greek
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's blonde girlfriend, Dimitra
Liani, the other heads of government pretended not to notice.
   It wasn't easy.
   Mrs. Thatcher devoted much of a news conference at the end of the
summit Saturday to renewed expressions of outrage against Belgian
Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, whose government refused to
extradite Ryan, and Charles Haughey, premier of the Irish Republic,
where the priest is holed up with an undisclosed religious order.
   ``It is not enough to sign ringing declarations against
terrorism. What matters is effective action,'' she snapped. ``We are
at the receiving end of vicious terrorist attacks. It our police, it
is our soldiers, our civilians ... who are being maimed or killed.''
   Nearly 3,000 people have died in Protestant-Catholic feuding in
British-ruled Northern Ireland in the past 20 years.
   Mrs. Thatcher herself narrowly escaped injury or death in 1984
when the IRA blew up her hotel in Brighton, England, and killed five
people.
   The mainly Catholic guerrilla movement, banned in both Britain
and Ireland, remains pledged to try to kill her in its drive to
unite Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic.
   Haughey and Martens, berated in separate meetings by Mrs.
Thatcher, refused to back down, denying political motivations and
saying they acted on purely legal grounds.
   Belgium, where Ryan was arrested in June, sent him to Ireland
last week after the 58-year-old priest went on hunger strike in jail.
   Mrs. Thatcher's anger at the Belgian action turned to fury as
Irish police let Ryan disappear while the Irish Attorney General
John Murray ponders the extradition request.
   ``It would be foolish to deny that this is an event of major
signifigance in Anglo-Irish relations that has caused major fallout
in many different directions,'' Haughey told Irish journalists at
the end of a tough session with Mrs. Thatcher on Saturday.
   On Friday, citing ``personal convenience,'' Haughey canceled a
scheduled meeting with Mrs. Thatcher at the hotel where they were
both staying.
   Not even Mrs. Thatcher said it publicly: but behind the Ryan
dispute lies an insinuation by Britain, a mainly Protestant nation,
that Belgium and Ireland, overwhelmingly Catholic countries, are
being faint-hearted because Ryan is a priest.
   The confrontation has thrown new strains on a 1985 accord which
gave the republic a consultative say in the running of Northern
Ireland.
   To many Irish, the confrontation smacks of another example of
British heavy-handedness, exacerbated by what some see as Mrs.
Thatcher pursuit of a personal war against the IRA regardless of
diplomatic or democratic niceties.

   The Savannah River Plant, the nation's sole
source of a critical nuclear weapons component, may not reopen until
the end of 1989, months later than the Energy Department projected,
The New York Times reported Sunday.
   The later-than-projected restart is due to delays in implementing
a department plan to overhaul training, safety, inspection,
management and other operations at the plant, the newspaper said,
citing government engineers.
   Savannah River is the nation's only source of tritium, a
radioactive form of hydrogen used in nuclear weapons. The gas decays
rapidly and must be replaced. None has been made since April.
   Pentagon experts have said that if Savannah River did not have
all three reactors operating by next summer, extraordinary steps
might be needed, including deactivating warheads and taking the
tritium for higher-priority weapons.
   On Tuesday, Energy Secretary John S. Herrington, said one of the
three reactors at the government-operated plant near Aiken, S.C.,
would open by spring or summer. The reactors have been closed for
safety reasons.
   Robert M. Keller, a senior nuclear engineer at the Energy
Department who wrote the overhaul plan, said it may take until
December 1989 to restart the first of the reactors, according to the
Times. The newspaper said engineers estimated that it would probably
take until the end of 1990 to restart the others.
   C. Anson Franklin, the Energy Department's chief spokesman, said
Herrington last week was not making a firm prediction, only ``a
guesstimate that may or may not be validated when all the
information is in.''
   Franklin said a report due to be completed Thursday would outline
the schedule for putting the plan into effect and offer a firm date
for reopening.

<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said Sunday he would
``wait and see'' if a U.S. refusal to grant him an entry visa was an
indication of things to come under the new Bush adminstration.
   Arafat made the comments after meeting with President Hosni
Mubarak to discuss the Palestinian leader's planned speech to the
U.N. General Assembly in Geneva.
   The assembly is to convene in Geneva Dec. 13-15. The session was
arranged after the State Department denied Arafat a visa to address
the world body during an annual debate on Palestine.
   The U.S. move provoked worldwide criticism.
   Asked if the decision was a reflection of future U.S. policy
under President-elect George Bush, Arafat was quoted as saying: ``I
prefer to wait and see. This is better.''
   Arafat and Mubarak said they still were exerting efforts to bring
peace to the Middle East.
   ``We all want peace and we all want a solution for the
(Palestinian) issue and we are all far away from terrorism and we
all hope that the Middle East will become stable and that everyone
will live in security, including Israel,'' Mubarak told reporters
after the talks.
   The official Middle East News Agency reported the comments of
both leaders.
   Arafat arrived Saturday night, his second visit to Cairo in 10
days. Because of security measures, his schedule is never published
in advance and it was not clear how long his stay would be.
   He has been touring Arab states since the Palestine Liberation
Organization's parliament-in-exile, the Palestine National Council,
proclaimed an independent state last month and implicitly recognized
Israel. Those moves will be the main focus of Arafat's address to
the General Assembly.
   ``I hope (Arafat's) speech will be successful and that it will
convince the international world opinion more and more of the
Palestinian issue which we consider the main cause for instability
in the region,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying.

   The head of an American missionary agency said
Sunday that Chinese customs officials had confiscated thousands of
Bible booklets he had planned to distribute in communist China.
   Rev. Eddie Karnes, general director of World Harvesters, Inc.,
said the Bible booklets were seized Saturday when he and an American
friend tried to enter China from Hong Kong as tourists.
   Karnes said the officials threw the 2,500 leaflets into burlap
bags, but later returned them when he decided not to enter China.
   He said he had planned to go to the southern Chinese city of
Canton, where he had distributed Bible booklets last week.
   Karnes said he has sent a telegram to President Reagan and
President-elect George Bush protesting what he called ``Chinese
religious apartheid.'' The missionary said he would call for
Christians worldwide to boycott Chinese goods.
   World Harvesters, Inc. is a missionary agency based in Yelm, Wash.

   Jurors who acquitted a man of
murdering his terminally ill wife sent a message that the infirm,
frail and dependent are not worth protecting, says an opponent of
mercy killing.
   But an advocate of euthanasia who believes evidence in a trial
was powerful enough to convict Dr. Peter Rosier said the jury simply
put compassion over the law because ``the law is not humane.''
   Although Rosier did not take the stand, the pathologist said in a
TV interview and in a book that he tried to help his cancer-stricken
wife Patricia, 43, commit suicide two years ago to end her misery.
   He gave her 20 sedatives and morphine, and she lingered in a coma
for 12 hours. Rosier botched the job, Mrs. Rosier's stepfather,
Vincent Delman, told the jury, so Delman said he went into the
bedroom and smothered her.
   Delman testified under immunity from prosecution, granted before
the state knew of his role.
   Defense attorney Stanley Rosenblatt argued Rosier knew the doses
of drugs he gave wouldn't kill; prosecutors charged Rosier was
trying to cash in on a book he wrote about his wife's suffering.
   The jury cleared Rosier on Thursday. He was charged with
first-degree murder, attempted murder and conspiracy, but jurors
also considered lesser offenses of second-degree murder,
manslaughter, aggravated battery and battery.
   ``That jury said something tremendously cruel: that the healthy
have a right to be protected, but those who are most vulnerable or
most dependent don't have that right,'' said Rita Marker, head of
the International Anti-Euthanasia Task Force.
   ``Patricia Rosier did not die of cancer. She did not kill her
herself. Her family killed her,'' Ms. Marker said.
   Derek Humphry, head of the pro-euthanasia Hemlock Society, sat
through the trial and agreed Rosier meant to kill his wife. But
Humphry said he doesn't believe it should be a crime to help end the
life of a terminally ill person who wants to die.
   ``The jury said, maybe he's guilty, but we're not going to
convict. The law is wrong,'' he said.
   Not so, said some jurors. ``We were ruling on the charges. We
didn't want to get into any discussion of euthanasia,'' said juror
Elaine Venezia.

<HEAD>Oppositon Demands Parliament Dissolve Before Presidential Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders Sunday demanded the
dissolution of Parliament before a new president is chosen, claiming
the present government is incapable of running a fair election.
   President Junius R. Jayewardene on Saturday announced Parliament
would be dissolved one day after the presidential election on Dec.
19. He also called parliamentary elections for Feb. 15.
   The opposition, however, said the parliamentary elections will
come too late to stop state assistance to the governing United
National Freedom Party.
   ``Our main demand has been Parliament be dissolved before ... the
presidential poll on Dec. 19, because all government machinery is
being used by Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa to continue his
campaign for the presidency,'' said Kumar Ponnambalam, general
secretary of the Ceylon Tamil Congress and spokesman for the
oppostion Democratic People's Alliance.
   Ponnambalam's alliance includes the largest opposition group, the
Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
   The strongest challenge to the United National Party comes from
the leader of the Freedom Party, former Prime Minister Sirimavo
Bandaranaike.
   But Buddhist and Christian leaders praised President Junius R.
Jayewardene's decision to call new parliamentary elections.
   ``We welcome the decision by President Jayewardene to dissolve
Parliament ... and advance general elections to mid-February from
the scheduled end-of-August time frame,'' said Venerable Palipanne
Chandananda, a Buddhist clergyman whose post is the equivalent of a
Christian archbishop.
   The Buddhist clergy have been a powerful political force in Sri
Lanka, where most of the Sinhalese ethnic majority are Buddhist.
   Chandananda, contacted by telephone in Kandy, 55 miles east of
Colombo, said the decision to conduct elections in February was ``a
positive response by the head of state.''
   Archbishop Marcus Fernando, head of the Roman Catholic clergy,
also welcomed the early election.
   ``It is a positive response to a public demand,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   Christians are a minority in Sri Lanka, drawing followers from
the Tamils, the Sinhalese and the Burghers, who are descended from
European colonists.
   Sri Lanka has been wracked by five years of ethnic bloodshed in
which minority Tamils are fighting the Sinhalese for an independent
homeland in the northeast. More than 9,000 people have been killed
since 1983 in massacres, bombings, assassinations and guerrilla
warfare.
   Sinhalese radicals have criticized the Sinhalese-dominated
government for its efforts to make peace with the Tamils.
   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
while Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, represent 18 percent.

Dalton Trumbo to write his 1960 film ``Spartacus.''
   Douglas received the ACLU's annual Bill of Rights Award at a
dinner Saturday celebrating the 197th birthday of the Bill of Rights.
   Trumbo was among many Hollywood figures blacklisted during the
anti-Communist backlash of the 1950s. Douglas, who co-produced
``Spartacus,'' is credited with the first public hiring of a someone

   The British flag was raised in a ceremony marking the return of
British diplomats to the building after full diplomatic relations
between Iran and Britain were restored last month.
   Swedish diplomats had looked after British interests in Iran
since the embassy was closed after the Iranian takeover of the U.S.
Embassy in 1979.
   Relations were all but ruptured last year when an Iranian

   Tourism has increased so much at Abraham
Lincoln's home since it reopened after a $2.2 million renovation
that some visitors have been turned away, and legislators are
seeking money for more tour guides.
   ``We've had a terrible situation where we've actually had to turn
away school kids who came to see the Lincoln home,'' said Rep.
Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who represents the district where the home
is located.
   Durbin and Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., are hoping to funnel an
additional $67,000 to the home for more guides during the busy
spring and summer months next year.
   ``This is a national treasure and it ought to be preserved,''
Simon said. ``We ought to make it as accessible to the public as
possible.''
   The home, which was bought by Lincoln in 1844, was closed in May
1987 for a $2.2 million restoration to ensure its stability. The
project also included interior decorating and a new paint job in its
historical hues. The home reopened in June.
   Simon, who has written a book about Lincoln's days in the
Legislature, said he was impressed by the job and could understand
the dramatic increase in the number of visitors.
   The National Park Service, which runs the site, reported that
nearly 1,600 visitors were turned away between Sept. 4 and Oct. 8
because the home was full.
   From June through September, 419,000 people toured the home, an
85 percent increase over the same period in 1986. The number of
visitors for all of 1986 was 440,775.

   Minimalist composer Philip Glass, Grateful Dead
percussionist Mickey Hart and Japanese synthesizer player Kitaro
took part in a Tibetan Ganden Ngam Cho, or ``festival of light,''
Saturday night at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine.
   It was the first time Western musicians participated in the music
performed on this Tibetan Buddhist holiday.
   By coincidence, it also was the first night of Hanukkah, the
Jewish ``festival of lights.''
   Twenty Gyuto monks, the Gyuto Tantric Choir, sat in two lines on
the floor of a stage and sang nine chants. The music sounded more
like a gutteral drone than a chant, with each note and syllable held
a long time, and most of it was lower than the deepest bass at a
Western opera house.
   While some voices hit a low note and held it, others hit tones
just above or below the main note. This gave a fullness and
resonance, but the tones were so close together it didn't sound like
harmony.
   When higher tones were held, it sounded like a large choir
singing a unison ``amen'.
   Actor Richard Gere, president of Tibet House here and master of
ceremonies, said that proceeds from a TV film and recording made at
the event will help build a Gyuto Buddhist monastery in Nepal. There
now is one monastery, in India. It was built after China invaded
Tibet in 1950, and a few of the 900 Gyuto Buddhist monks fled to
India.
   Saturday was the 25th day of the 10th lunar month, the date of
both the birth and death of Tsong Khapa. Robert Thurman, a professor
at Columbia University, said that Tsong Khapa revitalized Buddhism
in Tibet and started a Gyuto monastery 514 years ago.
   He said that the music offered on this festival makes a listener
momentarily free of ``stinginess, egotism, anger, poverty, pain and
fear'' and able to feel ``love, clarity and joy.''
   Once, public performances of chants by monks were not considered
appropriate.
   Glass, playing organ at the back of the church, Kitaro playing
synthesizer, and Hart, with two percussion instruments, in front of
the stage where the monks sat, played a 20-minute piece of modified
minimalist music before the monks chanted. Miles Davis, who was
scheduled to play, was ill and was replaced by Kitaro.
   Thurman said the guests were invited to play because the monks
feel that ``from their hearts, musicians come out and play and
celebrate truth. The monks envision them as dieties making offerings
to the Buddha.''
   Hart's 360 Productions and Tibet House are sponsoring the monks'
U.S. visit, which began in early November on the West Coast and
continues to Philadelphia, Boston and Northampton, Mass.

   Texas power is on the upswing in Washington,
where Lone Star State clout just may eclipse those potent days when
Sam Rayburn was speaker of the House and Lyndon B. Johnson headed
the Senate.
   ``Things are looking good for us,'' says Rep. Jack Brooks,
D-Texas. ``You've got Democrats taking over Congress and Republicans
taking over the administration from Texas.''
   Adopted Texan George Bush assumes the presidency on Jan. 20,
bringing with him at least two and as many as five Cabinet members
from Texas. House Speaker Jim Wright, who hails from Fort Worth, is
likely to retain his leadership post in voting this week.
   James A. Baker III, Bush's nominee for secretary of State, is
from Houston while Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, the first
Hispanic member of a president's Cabinet, is the son of a cowhand
and former president of Texas Tech University.
   The Texas list goes on in Congress where Rep. Kika de la Garza is
chairman of the Agriculture Committee and Reps. Brooks and Henry B.
Gonzalez are in line to take over the House Judiciary and Banking
committees, respectively.
   On the Republican side, former Texas Sen. John Tower is under
serious consideration for secretary of Defense, Houston businessman
Robert Mosbacher is rumored a contender for secretary of Commerce
and former congressman Tom Loeffer is mentioned for secretary of
Energy.
   ``This is the first time in our history that we've had a Texan as
president and as speaker of the House. And we have a number of
Texans as chairmen of committees now,'' says Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
himself the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
   ``I've never seen that many Texans holding that many positions.
We'll certainly get some attention to our (state's) concerns,'' said
the defeated Democratic vice presidential nominee.
   ``When you're in power you're in style, and Texas is back in
style,'' says Democratic consultant George Shipley of Austin.
   Bush would break the record for Texans in the Cabinet if he
appoints at least four, according to George Christian, who served as
press secretary to Johnson from 1966 to 1969. The most Texans at any
one time in Johnson's Cabinet was three, Christian says.
   ``Historically, Texans have had strong leadership in Washington,
but the difference is today it has a bipartisan tinge to it that it
didn't have before,'' says Christian. ``We have feet in both camps,
and that's an improvement.''
   ``It's really a Texas brigade in the North,'' says Bob Mansker,
press secretary to Democratic Rep. Martin Frost of Dallas.
   It's a heady ascent for the state that some love to hate, and
Brooks is warning his colleagues to avoid taking the power too
seriously.
   ``We cannot be smug about our leadership,'' Brooks says. ``We
don't know what kind of rapport you can work out with the
administration, and the problems are so big and the solutions are
going to be tough.''

   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan said
Sunday she has been too busy taking over the government to determine
whether documents exist shedding light on the death of her
predecessor or on Pakistan's nuclear capability.
   ``We haven't gone into these issues yet,'' Ms. Bhutto said in a
live television interview from Pakistan.
   She told British interviewer David Frost she has had other
priorities since being sworn into office on Friday, including naming
a Cabinet which was installed on Sunday.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, also revealed that unspecified complications
resulted in her giving birth to a 7-pound son on Sept. 21 instead of
in October when he was due.
   It was widely believed in Pakistan that Ms. Bhutto tricked
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq into calling elections for Nov. 16,
giving her time to recover from the birth and to resume campaigning.
Her family had let it be known the baby was not due until November
or December.
   ``I think the baby outwitted both of us,'' Ms. Bhutto said when
asked whether her son was premature or whether she had outwitted
Gen. Zia.
   ``The baby wasn't due until October, but because of certain
complications, he arrived in September.''
   Ms. Bhutto would not elaborate on the complications, but said her
son Bilawal was ``fine.''
   Zia died in a mysterious plane crash Aug. 17 after setting a date
for Pakistan's first free elections in more than a decade. Zia
overthrew the last civilian government led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,
Ms. Bhutto's father, in 1977, and two years later ordered his
execution.
   Authorities suspect sabotage in the crash, and a probe is
continuing.
   Ms. Bhutto, leader of the Pakistan People's Party, said that when
she took her oath of office Friday she could feel her father's
presence ``and sense his pride, not only in me, but in the success
of the whole party and in the success of democracy.''
   She said that if her father could advise her during her early
days as prime minister, ``first and foremost he would want me to be
my own person, because each one of us are judged on our own records,
not on the records of our famous forebearers.''
   Ms. Bhutto, who retained her maiden name following her arranged
marriage to businessman Asif Ali Zardari, said that motherhood has
meant changes.
   ``I start my day differently,'' she said. ``I go and see him (her
son) first thing. I end my day differently because I see him last
thing.''
   ``It's really nice to have a child,'' she said, adding ``It
doesn't sound very liberated, but a child does give much joy.''
   Asked whether she fears the army will attempt another coup in
Pakistan, Ms. Bhutto said, ``One cannot live on fears. One survives
on hopes.''
   Ms. Bhutto did not respond to questions of Pakistan's nuclear
capacity. Zia maintained the country had no program for producing an
atomic bomb, and used its facilities for enriching uranium _ a
process used to increase its radioacitivity _ only for peaceful
purposes. Outside experts, including U.S. officials, were skeptical.

<HEAD>Israeli in Iran-Contra Deal Said He Was In Mexico for Avocados</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Amiram Nir, the Israeli go-between in
secret U.S. arms deals with Iran who died in a light plane crash
last week, told people he was in Mexico to buy avocados, police said.
   Federal authorities continued Sunday to investigate both the
plane crash and Nir's visit to Uruapan, an out-of-the-way city in
the western mountains of Michoacan state famed for its avocados and
notorious for drug trafficking.
   New revelations about Nir's role in the Iran-Contra affair,
meanwhile, emerged Sunday in a Washington Post report quoting him as
saying in June that a secret U.S.-Israeli agreement authorized
counterterrorist operations he supervised with former White House
aide Oliver North in 1985-86.
   Nir, 37, was a counterterrorism adviser to Prime Minister Shimon
Peres and his successor, Yitzhak Shamir.
   In Jerusalem, the office of Peres, now foreign minister, denied
the Washington Post report Sunday.
   ``There is no such agreement,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon
Liel said in a statement. He declined to elaborate.
   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, appearing on ABC-TV's
``This Week with David Brinkley,'' was asked if such an agreement
ever existed.
   ``Not that I know of,'' he replied.
   Police here said they have no evidence that Nir's visit involved
anything but avocados. But they could not explain why he apparently
decided to travel under an assumed name.
   Jose Luis Arriaga, a Federal Judicial Police commander in
Uruapan, said Nir spent three days at the best hotel in town and
discussed avocado prices with a French-owned exporter. Nir was
traveling on a visa issued Nov. 25 in London.
   ``He came to solicit prices for avocados,'' Arriaga said.
   He said Nir had planned to return to Uruapan in a week, possibly
to close a deal with the exporter Eupasa, a local subsidiary of
Lucal France, a fruit and vegetable importer based in France.
   When Nir left Uruapan on a charter flight he registered under an
assumed name, Pat Weber. However, Arriaga said, Nir used his own
name at the hotel in Uruapan.
   Arriaga said police obtained information about Nir's visit from
Pedro Curchet, the local agent for Eupasa, which he said employs
about 50 people in an avocado-packing operation in Uruapan.
   Curchet identified Nir's body in the wreckage of the Aerotaxis of
Uruapan Cessna T-210 that went down Wednesday in the mountains
outside Ciudad Hidalgo, about 110 miles west of Mexico City.
   The pilot also died and three other people were seriously
injured. One was a Canadian woman, Adriana Stanton, 25, who said she
knew Nir only slightly and the others apparently were only sharing
the chartered flight.
   Stanton told The Associated Press Thursday that she did not know
what Nir was doing in Mexico.
   ``I don't know what his usual itinerary is. I don't know if he
comes to Mexico a lot,'' she said.
   The Mexico City daily La Jornada said Saturday that Stanton was
also traveling under an assumed name, Esther Arriaga. The newspaper
did not quote a source for the information.
   Curchet was one of a party of about eight people from Argentina
who had been staying at the hillside hotel since September. Hotel
personnel said they left Thursday or Friday.
   They said Stanton arrived before Curchet and they did not know if
she was working with him.
   Hotel personnel and police who interviewed Curchet said the visit
was Nir's first. Curchet could not be located for comment, and the
offices of Eupasa in Uruapan were closed Sunday.
   Arriaga said the investigation involves Mexican aviation experts
from Mexico City and the international police organization Interpol.
   Israeli Embassy officials and friends of Nir in Israel have said
Nir was in Mexico on a business trip but would not reveal the nature
of the visit.
   Arriaga said he did not know if Nir was acting as an independent
buyer or as an agent for an importer abroad.
   In November, local avocado businessmen formed the Association of
Producers and Exporters to compete with the foreign exporters from
Eupasa.
   Federal authorities describe the region as critical to drug
trafficking. Marijuana is grown clandestinely and the mountains are
pocked wtih secret airstrips for transporting drugs.

<HEAD>6 Dead, 5 Missing As Boatload of Illegal Immigrants Capsizes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A boat carrying 53 Dominicans trying
to illegally enter Puerto Rico capsized, killing six and leaving
five missing and presumed drowned, the U.S. Coast Guard said Sunday.
   The Coast Guard's Rescue Center in San Juan said the 25-foot
wooden boat capsized Saturday 18 miles west of Desecheo Island,
halfway between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, while
transferring passengers to a Dominican Coast Guard vessel.
   The cutter USS Monhegan helped the Dominican ship rescue 42 of
the people who fell overboard, a duty officer at the rescue center
said. He said six were known to have drowned and five were missing.
   The search was called off at noon Sunday when no sign of the
missing was detected, the officer said.
   Reports from a Dominican navy spokesman and the Coast Guard's
Rescue Center indicate that the small boat sailed Saturday from a
beach on the northeastern coast of the Dominican Republic and was
spotted that night by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter patrolling the
area.
   The USS Monhegan was sent to keep watch over the small craft
until the Dominican ship arrived and began to transfer the
passengers aboard.
   The patrols by the Dominican and U.S. Coast Guard units began
Saturday to search for a group of 27 Dominicans reported missing
since last week, when the boat on which they and 12 others traveled
was shipwrecked near Mona Island, located south of Desecheo. Twelve
were rescued, but the remaining 27 have not been found.
   The flow of Dominicans immigrating illegally to Puerto Rico in
small open boats has increased sharply in the last two weeks.
   In a five-day period that began Thanksgiving Day, 232 illegal
Dominican immigrants were caught in and around Puerto Rico's western
coast, the largest number arrested in Puerto Rico's history,
according to officials.
   But many others make it across the treacherous waters of the Mona
Passage.
   Border Patrol Chief Joe B. Bennett estimated only about 10
percent to 15 percent of those entering the island are caught. He
said 2,617 Dominican aliens have been arrested since April.

<HEAD>Some Residents Of Elite Community Want More Privacy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTH OAKS, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The locked gate that once guarded the
main road into this elite community is long gone, but some residents
want their privacy back, even suggesting ID armbands to identify
unwanted visitors.
   The 3,200 residents of the quiet, wooded community outside St.
Paul can legally make the world go away because everyone's property
extends to the middle of the road. With no no public streets,
residents can stop outsiders at the border.
   Residents maintain they aren't snobs. Rather, said Joan Brainard,
publisher of the North Oaks News and a former City Council member,
``We don't feel residents of other cities should willy-nilly be
using our facilities.''
   North Oaks has several lakes with beaches, tennis courts, hockey
rinks and soccer and football fields.
   The main entrance once had a locked gate; now there are four
entrances and Homeowners Association president William Ecklund said
installing security gates on them is not feasible because ``we've
got too many people out there.''
   A recent survey by the association, to which half its members
responded, found that 85 percent favor the use of ID decals on
residents' cars and 69 percent said decals should be on bicycles,
too.
   Some have gone so far as to suggest deputizing some residents who
could evict or arrest trespassers, but the board rejected the idea.
Member Sharon Anderson was turned off by the prospect of a
``vigilante group roaming the town.''
   Other suggestions that haven't gotten off the ground include
issuing residents armbands or ID cards.
   One resident, Connie Zmijewski, said she believes the town is
hurting itself by pushing for more privacy.
   She noted that last year a proposal to increase annual homeowners
association dues to build bicycle and walking paths was soundly
defeated after some opponents argued that the trails would attract
more outsiders.
   ``I'd hate to see park and recreation facilities not developed
because of our fear of others,'' she said. ``That's going
backwards.''

<TEXT>
   Government troops, tanks and angry
bottle-throwing protesters surrounded hundreds of army renegades
holed up at a military arsenal Sunday in their four-day rebellion.
   The uprising is the worst threat to President Raul Alfonsin since
his civilian government replaced a disgraced military dictatorship
in 1983.
   The government has refused to negotiate with the rebels. The
rebels face loyalist troops led by the army chief-of-staff, Lt. Gen.
Jose Dante Caridi, at a suburban Buenos Aires stronghold. Another
group near the capital surrendered Sunday, but other troops about 60
miles west of the city joined the rebellion.
   Alfonsin had wide support to quell the third rebellion in the
past 18 months and pledged to ``suffocate it.''
   The Interior Ministry issued a statement saying the government
would ``in no way negotiate the positions invoked by the fractious
groups.''
   Authorities used tear gas to repeatedly disperse protesters who
threw rocks and bottles at the arsenal in Villa Martelli, a
working-class neighborhood nine miles from downtown Buenos Aires.
   Tens of thousands of people gathered in plazas across this South
America nation to support a democracy that has suffered six military
coups since the 1930s.
   Rebels are demanding an end to the prosecution of officers for
human rights abuses committed during the 1976-83 dictatorship,
changes in retirements and promotion schedules, and higher wages.
   In a communique Sunday from the arsenal, the renegades said their
rebellion is solely a military matter and not ``a crisis .. . that
affects the political power of the nation.''
   The 4-million-member General Labor Confederation, the nation's
largest labor coalition, called a general strike for midnight to
last at least 24 hours.
   Nearby residents of the arsenal were ordered to evacuate after
the 35 government tanks and troops moved in.
   Official sources estimate the rebels, led by Col. Mohamed Ali
Seineldin, number about 500 and are backed by at least nine tanks.
   On Sunday afternoon, the army announced that other rebels
surrendered at the infantry school at the sprawling Campo de Mayo
army base, 22 miles northwest of the capital. They were arrested,
the army said.
   They army did not say how many rebels surrendered or whether they
gave up peacefully.
   The insurrection began Thursday when 53 members of an elite coast
guard unit robbed an arsenal and deserted their base. Also, officers
tried to incite troops at two other army bases in suburban Buenos
Aires.
   On Friday, troops at an infantry school rebelled. On Saturday,
most of the rebels moved to an army arsenal in the Villa Martelli
neighborhood 15 kilometers from downtown Buenos Aires.
   On Sunday, troops in the 6th infantry regiment at Mercedes, 60
miles west of the capital, joined the rebellion, but no further
details were immediately available. The news agency Noticias
Argentinas quoted unidentified army sources as saying 70 rebels
mutinied.
   In Buenos Aires, a city of 10 million, its five television
stations continued broadcasting news, with public messages playing
across the bottom of the screen urging people to defend democracy.
   Tanks and men armed with automatic weapons dressed in combat
fatigues were featured on front pages of all the Sunday newspapers.
TV showed rebels checking land mines, digging trenches, positioning
tanks.
   At the heavily-fortified Government House, Alfonsin met
continually with Cabinet ministers and military advisers. At midday,
he attended mass in a chapel within the building.
   A commission appointed by Alfonsin published a report in November
1984 that said at least 8,900 Argentines were arrested by security
forces and ``disappeared'' in a government-backed ``Dirty War''
against leftist surversion.
   In December 1985, a civilian court convicted nine former military
junta members, including former President Jorge Videla, of human
rights abuses. The civilian court trials against other military
officials are scheduled to resume soon.
   The civilian government, which replaced the dictatorship in
December 1983, ended revolts in April 1987 and January 1988.

<HEAD>Impoverished City Threatened With Loss Of State Tax Revenue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This impoverished city, already
unable to pay its employees on time or afford cleaning supplies for
City Hall, now is threatened with the loss of its share of state
sales and income tax revenue.
   The city was notified last week that it was $3.1 million in debt
to a public employees pension program, the Illinois Municipal
Retirement Fund.
   Jack Edman, director of legal affairs for the fund, said it is
entitled to recover the back payments by having money deducted from
tax revenue due East St. Louis.
   The loss of the tax money would be a devastating blow to the
city. The income and sales taxes provide about $2.5 million of its
$6.8 million budget for this year.
   The city across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, Mo.,
suffers from an eroded industrial and commercial tax base, a
predominately poor minority population and accusations of municipal
mismanagement.
   City officials were warned about the debt in a letter from the
pension fund dated Nov. 29.
   ``We've given them 30 days from the date of the letter to work
payment out,'' Edman said. ``If they take no action, we'll go to the
state comptroller and request the money be deducted.''
   City attorney Eric Vickers said Saturday he was unaware of the
threat to seize the city's state tax revenues. ``We're certainly
going to take whatever action is necessary to prevent them from
doing that,'' Vickers said.
   The city does not have the money in the bank to pay the debt,
officials said.
   In fact, a purchasing official warned in a memo last week that
the city did not even have enough money to order toilet paper and
cleaning supplies, which he said were dangerously low, the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch reported Sunday.
   The city was able to pay its 200 employees last week only because
Treasurer Charlotte R. Moore drove to the Capitol to pick up a
$139,000 check for the city's share of state income tax revenue.
Employees still are one paycheck behind.
   The city's debt to the pension fund has been growing steadily
since 1979, Edman said.
   Robert L. Cusma, executive director of the fund, said city
retirees could be affected. ``If we don't get the money, we can't
pay the pensions'' owed them, he said. ``I'd be quite perturbed, if
I were a city employee.''

   A woman identified as the lover of Walker Railey is
expected to testify Monday in a lawsuit accusing the former minister
of nearly strangling his wife, a lawyer for the wife's family says.
   Lucy Papillon has been ordered to testify in the case, said Bill
Arnold, the attorney for the family of Peggy Railey.
   Mrs. Railey was choked and left for dead in her garage in 1987.
The woman, then 38, is in what doctors have described as a
``persistent vegetative state'' in a nursing home.
   Ms. Papillon's alleged relationship with Railey became known last
year in a grand jury investigation of the attack.
   Railey, 41, former senior minister of the First United Methodist
Church, has been identified by police as a suspect in the case, but
no charges have been filed. Prosecutors have said the matter is
under investigation.
   Railey has denied trying to kill his wife and maintains he was
working on a research project at Southern Methodist University at
the time. He is believed to be living in California and is not
expected at Monday's proceedings.
   Ms. Papillon, a 46-year-old Dallas psychologist, has not publicly
discussed her relationship with Railey but sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity said she told a grand jury last year they had
been lovers since 1986.
   State District Judge John Whittington ruled last spring that
Railey, by refusing to respond to the lawsuit, technically admitted
the charges contained in the documents.
   He ``knowingly, maliciously and brutally attempted to strangle
his wife'' and cover up his actions with a ``false alibi,'' the
judge ruled.
   The civil case will decide how much in damages Mrs. Railey's
family is to receive.

   This historic fishing port with its
trawlers and luxury yachts, fish processing plants and cliffside
mansions has spent the last decade in a frustrating battle against a
rising tide of heroin addiction.
   A modest force of 51 patrolmen covers this city of 28,000 people
and 32 square miles with no more than an average share of violent
crime, break-ins and drunken driving.
   But up to six times a year police are called to the scene of a
drug overdose death, far more often than in other Massachusetts
cities of similar size. ``It appears it's never going to end,'' said
Police Chief Earland Worthley.
   A man found dead in November of an apparent overdose ``came down
here from Malden to do it,'' Worthley said. The drug is easy to find
here, he said.
   In 11 years as chief, Worthley said there have been 20 to 25
heroin overdose deaths. Drug counselor Ron Morin said there have
been more than 30 in the past five years.
   Gloucester is a working-class community of large, close-knit
families of French-Canadian, Portuguese, Yankee, Irish and Italian
backgrounds. The community saw a lot of friction years ago when
followers of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon became a major force in the
local fishing industry.
   Why did heroin come to Gloucester and stay?
   ``It defies an easy, simple explanation,'' said Essex County
District Attorney Kevin Burke.
   The obvious assumption that heroin comes in by boat is incorrect,
he said; it comes by car from New York City, Providence, R.I., and
Chelsea, a blue-collar city near Boston.
   Morin estimated there are 300 heroin addicts in Gloucester, or
roughly one resident in 100, a rate 62 percent higher than the
statewide average. As recently as 1982 there were only about 50
Gloucester addicts, authorities said.
   In the 1960s and 1970s, heroin was prevalent among young people
all over eastern Massachusetts, Burke said. Heroin fell out of favor
elsewhere, but in Gloucester ``it never lost its appeal.''
   The two-weeks-on, two-weeks-off schedule of many fishermen is
conducive to alcohol and drug abuse, Morin said. A more important
factor, he said, is Gloucester's isolation as a working-class
community surrounded by wealthy seacoast communities like
Manchester, Ipswich and Rockport.
   ``Gloucester, because of its position in the middle, tends to
attract the losers from other communities,'' Morin said.
``Gloucester's the place where you can live in a $50-a-week room.''
   Last week, Burke assigned two state troopers to Gloucester's
four-member drug task force. ``We're going to arrest as many people
as we can who are using and abusing drugs. Maybe we can drive some
folks into treatment,'' he said.
   Earlier this year, Burke's office, in what he said was a first in
the state, indicted two heroin dealers on manslaughter charges in
the deaths of two addicts.
   Possibily because Gloucester's heroin users are a part of a
stable, family-oriented community, addiction has not brought with it
the crime that besets other cities.
   ``It's still this little town surrounded by natural beauty and
everybody knows everybody and nobody's living in fear and homes
aren't being broken into,'' said Phil Salzman, a high school teacher
who keeps a file of drug overdose obituaries to help him dramatize
the problem in his classes.

<HEAD>Reports Say Death Toll From Cyclone Could Surpass 2,000</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FARID HOSSAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll from a cyclone that
pounded southern Bangladesh and India could surpass 2,000, officials
and news reports said Sunday.
   The number of people still missing ranged from 3,000 to 5,000,
according to newspapers and officials in the two countries.
   According to the Red Crescent, the Moslem equivalent of the Red
Cross, at least 1,115 people died in the storm in Bangladesh.
   A navy officer who toured some of the hardest hit areas along the
coast put the death toll at 1,300. Dhaka newspapers, however, said
the tally had reached 1,500 and was likely to climb higher.
   In India's West Bengal state adjoining Bangladesh, the official
death toll reached 500 on Sunday.
   The actual number of deaths may never be known. Communication is
poor in much of the region, and bureaucracy slows the reporting of
verifiable deaths in some places.
   The cyclone, which roared ashore from the Bay of Bengal on
Tuesday, devastated 30 of the 64 administrative districts in
Bangladesh and destroyed up to 70 percent of the rice crops ready
for harvest, according to a preliminary government assessment.
   The government had expected to harvest 2.7 million tons from the
areas struck by the cyclone.
   Newspapers estimated between 2.5 million and 5 million people
were left homeless by the cyclone, which hit mostly mud-and-straw
houses in coastal villages.
   President Hossain Muhammad Ershad told a meeting of the National
Disaster Prevention Council on Sunday: ``The nation must face
cyclones and floods with courage.''
   The council was formed last summer after floods covered
three-fourths of the country, claimed at least 1,500 lives and left
an estimated 30 million people homeless and destroyed about two
million tons of grain.
   Ershad has said his government will mobilize its resources to
help the survivors of the cyclone. But the government of this
impoverished nation of 110 million, where the per capita annual
income is $150, will be hard-pressed to meet the task.
   Bangladesh is a victim of geography, with most of the country
barely above sea level, and cyclones and floods strike with deadly
regularity.
   In 1970, more than 300,000 died when a cyclone hit. A 1983
cyclone caused 10,000 deaths.

<TEXT>
   A Cuban official said Sunday that the
sudden departure of South African diplomats derailed talks aimed at
peace in Angola and South-West Africa just as an agreement was about
to be signed.
   The South African delegation left Brazzaville on Saturday night
after four days of talks, saying it had to consult with its
government.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha, who led the delegation, said the
talks ``could be resumed within a few days'' and a protocol signing
``is still a possibility.''
   But Cuban amd Angolan diplomats were reported to be angered by
the surprise departure of the South Africans after four days of
talks. Negotiators had hoped an interim treaty would be signed on
Saturday or Sunday, followed by a formal treaty ceremony in New York.
   The diplomats questioned South Africa's commitment to a
U.S.-mediated effort to negotiate the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban
troops from Angola and implementing U.N.-sponsored independence for
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia. The territory is
controlled by South Africa.
   ``If the South Africans were truly for peace in Angola and
independence in Namibia they would not have employed this diplomatic
ruse,'' said Ricardo de Quesada, Cuba's vice-minister for foreign
affairs.
   He said the diplomats were so close to agreement that the text
already had been typed.
   ``(The South Africans) have insulted everyone ... It is
legitimate to ask if they were negotiating seriously,`` de Quesada
said.
   He added, however: ``We think there is still a chance that we
will find ourselves back here in Brazzaville, but everything depends
on the contacts that are established by the mediator.''
   Chester Crocker, U.S. Assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, has been leading the negotiations.
   De Quesada's Angolan counterpart, Venancio de Moura, said Angola
and Cuban had been very flexible, ``but sadly we were treated
arrogantly by the South Africans.''
   The main obstacle to the agreeement has been the issue of how to
verify the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops, the first of which
arrived in Angola in 1976 to support the Marxist government. South
Africa has insisted on a Cuban pullout as a condition for granting
independence to South-West Africa, also known as Nambibia.
   The four sides have agreed to a 27-month timetable for a Cuban
withdrawal, but South Africa has demanded representation on the
force monitoring the withdrawal. Cuba and Angola have refused a
South African presence on the monitoring commission, saying the
United Nations will supervise the pullout.
   The Cuban troops have supported the Angolan government against
U.S.-aided rebels led by Jonas Savimbi, supported by South African
forces based in South-West Africa.
   De Moura on Sunday offered amnesty to the followers of the
guerrilla leader, who he said was responsible for ``the atrocities,
murders and destruction of the Angolan economy.'' But he said there
was ``no place for (Savimbi) in Angolan society.''

<HEAD>Unlimited Candidates to Campaign in State-Funded Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unlimited number of candidates for a new
national legislature will be allowed to campaign in the official
media at state expense early next year, according to an election law
published Sunday.
   Publication of the law pushed through the Supreme Soviet
parliament Thursday by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave voters
their first look at final details of the system under which they
will select 2,250 members of a new Congress of People's Deputies on
March 26.
   The Soviet Union last year began experimenting with allowing more
than one candidate in some elections, breaking a tradition of single
candidates approved by authorities for their political reliability.
   ``Any number of candidates for deputy can be registered,'' the
new law says.
   ``Candidates for people's deputy of the U.S.S.R. from the time of
their registration by the election commission have an equal right to
speak at pre-election and other meetings, sessions and gatherings,
in the press and on television and radio,'' it says.
   The law also says that candidates ``do not incur expenses
connected with preparation and carrying out of elections.''
Candidates may have a staff of up to 10 people, should be paid their
normal salary while they are campaigning and are allowed free public
transportation in their district, except by taxi.
   While the new law seems to assure more candidates, it remains an
open question whether there would be much of a difference in their
views.
   The Communist Party still is enshrined in the Soviet Constitution
as the guiding force of Soviet society, and the law specifically
prohibits candidates from advocating any action that is against the
constitution or laws of the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev, speaking to the Supreme Soviet on Nov. 29, said ``a
possibility of a real choice is ... being provided.''
   ``Maximum use should be made of existing possiblities to give
every voter knowledge of the candidates. Try as they will, they
can't make sure that everybody will come to the meet-the-candidates
rallies,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``So a big role is to be played here by radio, television and the
press. And indeed can there be anything more revealing than public
debates in which the candidates parry questions, put forth their
views and, if you like, show their worth?'' he said.
   The law does not put a limit on campaign expenditures, but says a
central election commission will be in charge of distributing
campaign money for local disbursement.
   Under constitutional changes approved along with the election law
and regarded by Gorbachev as a vital part of his reform effort, the
Congress has the power to choose the Soviet president and also a
smaller, more active Supreme Soviet.
   That Supreme Soviet will replace the 1,500-member body that less
than two months ago broke its tradition of unanimously approving all
government and Communist Party directives.
   The Congress will be made up of deputies elected from
geographical districts, ethnic homelands and from organizations such
as the Communist Party, unions and social organizations.
   The law calls for public meetings in electoral districts to
nominate candidates who then go before a district meeting. In each
meeting the candidate must receive the votes of at least 50 percent
of the voters, but no limit was placed on the number of candidates
who may be endorsed.
   In June 1987, more than one candidate for local councils was
allowed in a few thousand of the country's 52,000 electoral
districts.

<HEAD>Government Newspaper Praises Exiled Soviet Poet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government newspaper Izvestia Sunday published
an article on Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky, placing the poet who
was once convicted as a parasite on society among this century's
greatest Soviet writers.
   Two Izvestia correspondents spoke briefly with the poet this fall
in Paris and attended seminars he had addressed.
   Brodsky, who left the Soviet Union in 1972 for New York, had only
a few of his poems published in the Soviet Union until the literary
monthly Novy Mir (New World) printed some of his works after he won
the 1987 Nobel Prize for Literature.
   Izvestia said Brodsky belonged among other Soviet writers who
have won the Nobel Prize, including Ivan Bunin, Boris Pasternak,
Mikhail Sholokov and Alexander Solzhenitsyn _ all of whom either
left the Soviet Union or were persecuted for their writings.
   In the early 1960s, a court convicted Brodsky of parasitism _
since writing poetry was not considered an official job _ and
sentenced him to hard labor.
   ``Along with the rightful feeling of patriotic pride and joy,
there is sadness,'' the article said, referring to a comment by a
Leningrad newspaper before Brodsky's exile that said there was ``no
place in Leningrad'' for him.
   The Izvestia article quoted Brodsky as saying he can't imagine
returning to Leningrad as a tourist, and would only be interested in
returning to see two or three close friends. But he was quoted as
saying he doubted he would go back.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or
greater openness, the Soviet Union has published works previously
banned for political reasons.
   Artists such as director Yuri Lyubimov, who left the country
because of government restrictions on their work, are returning to
stage new productions or to perform.

   China's top diplomat said Monday that his visit to
the Soviet Union was the first step toward thawing three decades of
chilly relations.
   ``We both believe a summit is possible but we still have to talk
about a specific date,'' Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told reporters
upon arriving at the Beijing airport. ``We must make serious
preparations.''
   Qian flew from Tokyo, where he had briefed Japanese officials on
his three-day visit to Moscow that ended Saturday.
   Qian's visit to Moscow, during which he held two hours of talks
with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and more than six hours of
talks with Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, was the first by a
Chinese foreign minister since 1957.
   He invited Shevardnadze to visit Beijing early next year but said
an exact date was not set.
   Both sides have said that a summit between Gorbachev and senior
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping could take place in the first half of
1989. Chinese and Soviet sources agree late April or May is the most
likely time.
   ``The most important result was we started the normalization
process,'' Qian told reporters as he walked from the plane to a
waiting limousine.
   He said talks focused on normalizing relations and the main
obstacle _ Soviet-allied Vietnam's 10-year occupation of Cambodia.
China maintains that Soviet aid is essential to the Vietnamese
occupation and wants Moscow to pressure Vietnam to pull out.
   Qian said the Soviet Union had agreed to do so. Asked if this was
a new position on Moscow's part, he said, ``You can understand it
that way.''
   ``Both China and the Soviet Union should play a role,'' he added.
   Qian said he and the Soviets discussed in general terms a
timetable for Vietnamese withdrawal and came closer together on this
issue. He refused to elaborate. China has said the Vietnamese should
pull out as soon as possible.
   Asked if all differences over Cambodia had to be resolved before
a summit was possible, Qian said simply, ``We must continue
discussions.''
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and toppled the
Chinese-allied Khmer Rouge, which had killed an estimated 1 million
fellow Cambodians in an effort to purge the country of all modern
influences. China is the main supporter of a guerrilla coalition,
including the Khmer Rouge, fighting the Vietnamese.
   China's two other requirements for normalizing relations with
Moscow are a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and reduction of
Soviet troops along the Chinese border. The Soviet Union has pulled
half of its more than 100,000 troops out of Afghanistan but halted
the process recently.
   It has cut slightly its troop presence in allied Mongolia,
adjoining China, and China and the Soviet Union have resolved part
of their border dispute.
   The Communist giants were close allies in the 1950s but split in
the early 1960s because of ideological and strategic differences
between Mao Tse-tung and Nikita Khruschev. Troops clashed along the
border in 1969.
   Trade, cultural and other non-political exchanges have grown
rapidly in the past few years as both countries have focused less on
ideology and more on economic development.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Sunday
insisted that one of his closest advisers be allowed to accompany
him to France on his first trip abroad in seven years.
   French President Francois Mitterrand invited Walesa to Paris to
attend the Dec. 10 celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
   Referring to historian Bronislaw Geremek, one of his closest
advisers, Walesa said: ``His company is necessary for me, not only
because he speaks French. There's just a very short time to prepare
myself and I need his help.'' ``Lech is insisting that I go,'' said
Geremek, who said the Solidarity leader asked him on Saturday to
make the trip.
   Geremek, who said he will make the request for a passport on
Monday, said he has been refused permission to travel abroad on five
separate occasions recently.
   Walesa said he had applied for a passport last week and was
informed on Saturday he could pick it up on Monday.
   The trip represents the first time the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize
winner has been given permission to leave Poland since the
imposition of martial law on Dec. 13, 1981.
   Polish citizens must apply for a passport each time they wish to
travel to a Western country. Travel restrictions have been eased in
recent years, although some passports still are denied for political
reasons.
   In March, Walesa was barred from making a trip to Australia
because the government said it did not want him to attend an
international trade union conference.
   Walesa helped found Solidarity, which was the only recognized
labor federation in the Soviet bloc. It was banned in 1981 and
outlawed the following year.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   While much of the nation enjoyed fair weather Sunday, squalls
continued to bring light snow to the lower Great Lakes region.
   Two to 5 inches of snow was expected in western New York State
southeast of lakes Erie and Ontario, and in western Mohawk Valley of
upstate New York.
   Up to a foot of snow blanketed higher elevations of Vermont by
Sunday morning.
   A cold front produced snow in the northern Appalachians, with 2
inches reported at Mount Washington, N.H., during the six hours up
to 1 p.m. EST. At noon, Mount Washington was reporting light snow
and fog, with 80 mph wind gusts and a temperature of 6 degrees below
zero.
   Strong northwest winds behind the cold front produced the snow
squalls in the lower Great Lakes region. Gale warnings were posted
for Lake Ontario and for the Atlantic coast from Delaware to Maine.
   Fog covered valleys west of the Rocky Mountains as a high
pressure area hovered over the western two-thirds of the country.
   Scattered light rain showers lingered over south-central Texas,
and clouds were prevalent from the northern high Plains through the
middle and upper Mississippi Valley into the Great Lakes region.
Most of the rest of the nation had fair to partly sunny skies.
   Freezing temperatures were primarily confined to the Northeast on
Sunday afternoon. Temperatures were generally in the 50s and 60s
from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast,
with 70s in southern Florida and south-central and southeastern
Texas. Temperatures were mostly in the 60s and 70s in Southern
California and southern Arizona, with readings above 80 at some
locations.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 19
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 84 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
The nation's low Sunday morning was 9 degrees below zero at
Gunnison, Colo.
   The National Weather Service forecast scattered snow showers
Monday in the lower Great Lakes region, rain in western Washington
and scattered rain showers in the rest of the Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures were expected to remain below 40 degrees from
northern Minnesota to northern New England, with highs in the 20s in
northern New England and upstate New York and teens across northern
Maine. Highs were predicted to be in the 30s in the high country
west of the central Rockies, above 60 from the southern and central
California coast to southern Arizona, in the 70s in extreme southern
California and extreme southern Arizona. Temperatures also should
exceed 60 from Florida to central Oklahoma and central Texas, with
70s across southern Florida.

<TEXT>
   Communist officials in a restive
province of the Serbian Republic on Sunday rejected calls by
Serbia's leaders to condemn recent mass rallies in the region.
   An extraordinary plenum of the Communist Party in Kosovo province
was convened to assess the largest-ever demonstrations two weeks ago
by the ethnic Albanian majority in the province.
   The rallies were staged to protest the resignation of two ethnic
Albanian leaders of the province who were forced to resign under
pressure.
   Serbian Communist leader Slobodan Milosevic is seeking to curtail
the autonomy of Kosovo to protect the Slav minority allegedly
persecuted by ethnic Albanians, who make up a 90 percent of Kosovo's
population.
   Serbian leaders also insist that the demonstrations were
``counterrevolutionary,'' a qualification apparently rejected by
Sunday's session in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.
   Djumret Seljami, an ethnic Albanian leader addressing the
meeting, insisted that ``the mass rallies of citizens of Albanian
nationality, in their initial days ... essentially expressed
Socialist and Yugoslav orientation.''
   But in his comments, quoted by the state news agency Tanjug,
Saljami acknowledged that the rallies assumed a more hostile tone in
the final days.
   Up to 100,000 people took to the streets to protest the dismissal
of former and current Presidium members Azem Vlasi and Kacusa Jasari.
   In another development, newspapers dsaid Sunday that two ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo had been sentenced to 45 and 60 days
imprisonment respectively for making threats against Milosevic.
   The Belgrade daily Politika said Enver Peci, 37, of the Kosovo
town of Vucitrn, was given 60 days by the local magistrate for
publicly stating that the ammunition he had in his pocket was for
use against Milosevic.
   The other defendant, 22-year-old Ljutvi Vanuzi, also of Vucitrn,
was sentenced for shouting in the local post office: ``Long live
(fired leaders) Jasari and Vlasi, death to Slobodan Milosevic.''
   In a related report, Politika said two ethnic Albanian farmers
near the Kosovo town of Decani were sentenced to two months each for
singing songs praising Enver Hoxha, the late leader of neighboring
Communist Albania.
   Thousands of Albanians have been sent to jail for demanding
greater autonomy for Kosovo.

<TEXT>
   The United States broke no United Nations
agreement when it barred Palestine Liberation Organization leader
Yasser Arafat from entering the country to speak at U.N.
headquarters in New York, Secretary of State George Shultz said
Sunday.
   The treaty that allowed the world organization to locate in New
York generally prohibits the United States from imposing any
impediment to the entry of those having business with the U.N.,
Shultz acknowledged.
   ``But we carefully preserved our right to exclude people who we
think threaten the security interests of the United States,'' Shultz
said on ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   ``Do we have the right to exclude anybody that the U.N. invites?
The answer to that is, clearly, yes, we do,'' Shultz continued.
``And then, second, within the scope of that reservation, given our
law, was it proper to exclude Arafat on the grounds of terrorism and
terrorism's relationship to our security? And I think the answer to
that is yes.''
   Shultz said he is comfortable with the decision he made a week
earlier to bar Arafat, even though only Israel backed the United
States when his move was condemned on a vote in the U.N. General
Assembly.
   ``I live in the United States and I'm secretary of state for the
United States and I was very pleased to hear what, I think, around
68 senators of the United States had to say,'' the secretary said.
   Sixty-eight senators and senators-elect of both parties signed a
letter hailing Shultz's decision.
   Newsweek magazine, meanwhile, cited unidentified U.S.
intelligence sources as saying that Palestinian hard-liners, perhaps
led by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, planned
terrorist attacks in New York if Arafat spoke at the United Nations.
   The hard-liners, Newsweek said, viewed Arafat's speech as too
conciliatory. The early draft of the speech ``refrained from
explicitly recognizing Israel but talked in general terms of Israeli
and Palestinian states working together,'' Newsweek said.
   The secretary of state was asked why he would allow Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega, whose government the United States opposes,
to come to the U.N.
   ``There is a law in the United States that finds the PLO to be a
terrorist organization and denies visas to members of the PLO,'' he
replied. ``There is no such law having to do with Nicaragua.''

   A judge on Sunday sentenced an American-born
immigrant to three years in prison for the shooting death of an Arab
shepherd who brought his sheep to graze near a Jewish settlement in
the occupied West Bank.
   The Jerusalem court last week convicted Israel Zeev of
manslaughter in the fatal May shooting. It was the first time a
Jewish civilian was convicted in the death of an Arab since the
start of the nearly yearlong Palestinian uprising.
   Zeev, 38, a Chicago native who moved to Israel more than 20 years
ago, also was convicted of shooting and seriously injuring a second
Arab.
   In the occupied territories Sunday, troops raided five West Bank
villages and rounded up suspected Arab protesters, Arab reports
said. At least eight Palestinians, most of them teenagers, were shot
and wounded in scattered clashes, hospital officials said.
   A military spokesman said he was checking the reports.
   In the West Bank town of Hebron, a hand grenade thrown at an
Israeli public bus exploded on the road and caused no injuries, the
army said. It exploded on the road, causing no injuries or damage.
Suspects were arrested, the Israeli news agency Itim said.
   The 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip have been engaged in a revolt against Israeli rule since Dec.
8, 1987. Israel captured the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the West Bank
from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Eleven Israelis and 318 Palestinians have been killed in the
uprising.
   Of the eight Arabs wounded Sunday, five were shot in the occupied
Gaza Strip, two were wounded in Nablus, the largest city in the
occupied West Bank, and one was shot in the West Bank village of
Awarta, hospital officials said.
   In annexed East Jerusalem, District Court Judge Zvi Cohen
sentenced Zeev to a two-year suspended sentence in addition to three
years in prison, and ordered him to pay the family of the dead Arab,
28-year-old Jude Abdallah Awad, about $17,500 in compensation. The
sum is the maximum amount allowed by Israeli law.
   Zeev's defense attorney, Jacob Weinroth, said he would probably
appeal the conviction.
   ``All along the main thing that has bothered my client in
principle was the fact that he killed a man,'' Weinroth said.
   After Zeev's sentencing, settlers from Shilo, 18 miles north of
Jerusalem, rose to shake his hand.
   Zeev, wearing jeans and the large knitted skullcap that is a
trademark of observant Jews, said nothing but appeared somewhat
relieved.
   Fellow settlers said they objected to the sentence, claiming Zeev
was merely doing his duty guarding the settlement and should have
been tried in a military rather than civil court. They vowed to
raise the compensation money. Arabs said District Court Judge Zvi
Cohen's sentence was too light.
   ``The sentence is very light,'' said Odeh Rantisi, former deputy
mayor of Ramallah, north of Jerusalem. ``This means disrespect for
life given by God. This is the law of the jungle, where the strong
kill the weak.''
   The maximum sentence for manslaughter is 20 years. But Zeev said
the Arab shepherds ignored his orders to leave the area and hurled
rocks at him when he fired warning shots in the air.
   Zeev, in jail for seven months since the killing occurred, will
have that period deducted from his sentence and will probably
qualify to get one-third of the term reduced for good behavior,
Weinroth said. He could be eligible for parole in 19 months.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union may raise the issue of human
rights in Britain during next week's talks between President Mikhail
Gorbachev and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a Soviet spokesman
said Sunday.
   ``I think simply a human rights question is a two-way street, and
charity begins at home,'' said Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov in an interview from New York with Independent
Television News. ``If you discuss our human rights problems, we can
also raise certain questions.''
   Gerasimov was interviewed after The Mail on Sunday, a weekly
tabloid, said the Soviets would attack Britain's human rights
record, especially in dealing with Irish terrorism suspects.
   The tabloid, which supports Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative
government, said Gorbachev had authorized ``a propaganda blitz''
that could include a meeting with families of Irish people convicted
of bombings in Britain. The Irish Republican Army is waging a
military campaign to oust the British from Northern Ireland and
reunite it with the Irish Republic.
   However, Gerasimov said the Soviets had no plans to embarrass
Mrs. Thatcher over the human rights issue during Gorbachev's Dec.
12-14 visit on his three-nation tour.
   Before going to Britain, Gorbachev is to arrive in New York on
Tuesday and in Cuba on Friday.
   During Mrs. Thatcher's visit to the Soviet Union last year, she
held talks with dissident Nobel Prize winner Andrei Sakharov and
gave Gorbachev at list of individual human rights cases of concern
to Britain.
   Mrs. Thatcher's aides said the prime minister normally raises
human rights issues in the Soviet Union when she meets Gorbachev and
would probably do so during next week's meeting.
   British commentators said that if Gorbachev raises the cases of
Irish men and women jailed for fatal pub bombings in Birmingham,
Woolwich and Guildford in 1974, Mrs. Thatcher will tell him that
their rights have been protected in a series of trials and appeals.
   Chris Mullin, a lawmaker from the opposition Labor Party who has
led a campaign to prove the innocence of the convicted people, said
he was writing to Soviet Ambassador Leonid Zamyatin to offer to
arrange for Gorbachev to be briefed on the cases.
   ``I welcome the news that Mr. Gorbachev may raise with Mrs.
Thatcher the case of the six innocent men convicted of the
Birmingham pub bombings and the total of 11 innocent people
convicted in connection with the Guildford and Woolwich pub
bombings,'' he said.
   Patrick McIlkenny, the brother of one of the men convicted in the
Birmingham bombings, said a meeting with Gorbachev would give ``an
extra boost'' to his brother's spirits, Independent Television News
reported. McIlkenny recently visited Moscow and met one of
Gorbachev's senior foreign affairs advisers.
   The six men were convicted of two IRA pub bombings that killed 21
people. A total of seven died in the attacks in Guilford and
Woolwich.

   Soviet officials and Afghan
guerrillas met in a Saudi mountain resort on Sunday, the second day
of negotiations on ending the 9-year-old war.
   The meeting in Taif is believed to include discussions on a
cease-fire and establishment of an interim government to replace the
current Soviet-backed regime.
   The talks mark the first time the Soviets and the seven-group
guerrilla alliance sat down together since Soviet troops were sent
to Afghanistan in 1979.
   The official Saudi press agency issued a terse statement saying
the talks began, but provided no details.
   The official talks began Saturday between the delegations led by
guerrilla leader Burhanuddin Rabbani and Yuri Vorontsov, a Soviet
deputy foreign minister recently named ambassador to Afghanistan.
   They resumed before noon Sunday in the town 600 miles southwest
of the Saudi capital of Riyadh.
   Rabbani heads the alliance of the seven Afghan resistance groups
based in Peshawar, Pakistan.
   The guerrillas, backed by Pakistan and the United States, were
not a party to the U.N.-mediated Geneva accords under which the
Soviets pledged to withdraw an estimated 100,000 troops from
Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   The first half have been withdrawn on schedule, but Moscow
suspended the withdrawal because the guerrillas continued to fight
Soviet troops and the Kabul government.

   The Soviet Union brought four hijackers back from
Israel Sunday and declared the success of a bargaining strategy that
gained the safe release of 30 children and the return of the gunmen
and their plane.
   The hijackers arrived at Moscow's Sheremetyevo 1 airport before
dawn Sunday, ending a drama that began when they commandeered a
school bus in the southern Russian city of Ordzhonikidze on Thursday.
   Vremya, the Soviet television evening news program showed two
bound hijackers being hustled off a plane at the airport early
Sunday and into waiting cars. They returned with the hijacked
Ilyushin 76-T transport plane and a special Tupolev 154 jet sent to
Israel for them.
   During the affair, Soviet authorities gave the hijackers weapons,
drugs and money to gain the release of the fourth-grade pupils and
worked with Israel, with which Moscow broke diplomatic ties 21 years
ago.
   ``The outcome of the operation will serve as a warning to those
who may nurture this kind of criminal designs,'' Tass quoted a KGB
secret police spokesman as saying.
   ``It is for the first time that such an operation has been
carried out with the participation of another state. And its results
can be described as successful: the criminals have been captured,
they will sustain a deserved punishment and, what is the main thing,
the children were rescued,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Tass said the decision to negotiate to save the children was
``the only right decision.''
   The Soviet strategy was in sharp contrast to tactics used in the
last known hijacking in March, when soldiers stormed a plane held by
members of a family jazz band from the Siberian city of Irkutsk.
   In that incident, five of the hijackers, three other passengers
and a stewardess died in the assault, and much of the plane was
reduced to ashes by a bomb set off by the hijackers. Some Soviet
papers later questioned whether force had been necessary.
   Reports in the state-run media Sunday detailed the operation to
save the children, their teacher and a bus driver and the decision
to give the hijackers a plane and eight crew members as hostages.
   But they did not say what charges the four would face, or where
they were being held. Tass indicated that a fifth person, the wife
of the man identified as the ringleader, probably would not be
charged.
   It said 29-year-old Tamara Fotaki was a virtual hostage herself,
and accompanied the hijackers onto the plane ``in the discharge of
her civic duty, for the sake of saving the lives of the 30 school
children and their teacher.'' Media reports identified the leader of
the gang as 38-year-old Pavel Yakshiyants, who was convicted three
times for robberies and theft. Geni Ageyev, a deputy KGB chairman,
described him as a ``hardened, habitual criminal,'' Tass said.
   Another was identified as 26-year-old V. Muravlev, a former
electrician with two previous convictions.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said the school-children had
been on a field trip to a printing plant when the hijackers captured
them.
   ``At the exit, near the gate, they saw a bus. The driver
hospitably opened wide the doors and said, `They sent us for you.'
The children, not thinking, entered the bus. And all the rest
developed like a detective story,'' Izvestia said.
   The hijackers took the bus to the nearby city of Mineralnye Vody,
from where they took off for Israel.
   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, said the hijackers
gradually released children as demands were met for vinegar,
apparently to dissolve drugs, medicine ``guaranteeing a high,'' and
weapons.
   Negotiations were led by Evgeny Sheremetyev, a KGB official from
nearby Stavropol, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's home area.
   After their demands were met for a large quantity of foreign
currency, the hijackers held only 11 of the children hostage, Pravda
said. Sheremetyev then offered himself in exchange for the rest and
was forced to lie on the floor of the bus while the plane was
prepared for the hijackers.
   Tass said the flight crew had been scheduled for a routine flight
to New Dehli, India, from Moscow and only learned of the hijacking
when they arrived in Mineralnye Vody.

   The dollar slipped slightly against the Japanese yen
at the start of the trading week Monday, while stock prices also
declined moderately.
   The dollar opened trading at 121.48 yen, down 0.16 yen from
Friday's close of 121.64 yen.
   The slide in the U.S. currency followed dollar-buying in the
Sydney market after news that ailing Japanese Emperor Hirohito took
a turn for the worse, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``The news of the emperor lingered a bit in the Tokyo market and
the dollar was sold off'' in the absence of other fresh news, added
the dealer, speaking anonymously.
   Hirohito, bedridden since Sept. 19 with internal hemorrhaging,
discharged a large amount of blood early Monday morning and was
given an emergency blood transfusion.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues toppled from its record closing figure of 29,665.50
points reached Saturday. It shed 104.64 points, or 0.3 percent,
shortly after the market opened to move to 29,560.86.

   Exploratory surgery Sunday confirmed a
3-year-old New Mexico girl is progressing well less than a week
after undergoing a rare, five-organ transplant, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   Rolandrea Dodge of Fruitland, N.M., was in critical condition
Sunday night in the intensive care unit of Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh.
   Rolandrea, who's known as Rolly, received a new liver, pancreas,
stomach, small intestine and part of a large intestine during 16{
hours of surgery that ended Tuesday.
   She was breathing with the help of a respirator following the
exploratory surgery, which lasted less than three hours Sunday
morning, said the spokeswoman, Sue Cardillo. The child's parents,
Cyndi and Branden Dodge, were at her bedside.
   ``The exploratory surgery allowed (doctors) to go inside and make
sure the suture lines are healing right and to see how the organs
are healing,'' Ms. Cardillo said. ``The organs are functioning. The
sutures were fine.
   ``They had gone in with the hope that everything was fine and
that's exactly what they found.''
   Rolly was born with an incurable disease that prevented her
intestines from absorbing food and liquids. Her high-protein
intravenous feedings caused her liver to fail.
   She was placed on the waiting list for a suitable donor after an
experimental drug failed to improve her condition.
   Of the few patients who have undergone five-organ transplants,
Tabatha Foster of Madisonville, Ky., lived the longest. She died at
the age of 3{ in May, six months after her landmark operation at
Children's Hospital.

   Soviet dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov will
stop in Paris to attend a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the
Declaration of Human Rights after he ends his visit to the United
States, a relative said Sunday.
   ``On his way to Moscow, he will stop in Paris for a few days at
the invitation of the French president,'' said Efrem Yankelevich,
Sakharov's stepdaughter's husband.
   Yankelevich said the visit would change Sakharov's schedule but
said he and family members were unsure when the Soviet human rights
activist would leave or when he would arrive in Moscow.
   Sakharov arrived in the United States a month ago.
   During his stay, Sakharov has undergone medical tests in Boston,
visited New York and Washington, where he met President Reagan, and
spent Thanksgiving at the suburban Boston home of Yankelevich and
his wife, Tatiana, who is the daughter of Sakharov's wife, Yelena
Bonner.
   The universal Declaration of Human Rights was passed by the
United Nations on Dec. 10, 1948, and spells out fundamental human
rights. The date is observed each year as international human rights
day around the world.

   Officials examined ransacked offices and
files on Sunday to try to assess damage resulting from a break-in at
the state budget office.
   Capital Police discovered a broken window on the first floor of
the Capitol late Saturday night and concluded that intruders had
gained access to two offices of the state Budget Division, said Tom
Cooper, a spokesman for the Office of General Services.
   The intruders dumped out files, but it wasn't known Sunday
whether anything was stolen, said Cooper.
   The Capitol break-in occurred less than a week after a burglary
at Gov. Mario Cuomo's living quarters in the nearby Executive
Mansion. Two men who had been arrested on burglary charges across
the state in Oneida County were found with stolen goods from the
mansion later last week.

   Ailing Emperor Hirohito received two blood
transfusions following heavy internal bleeding Monday morning, and
palace officials said his blood pressure recovered to near normal
levels after plummeting dangerously.
   The 87-year-old emperor suffered ``a large amount of bleeding''
and was given 1.7 pints of blood in an emergency transfusion, said
Kenji Maeda, spokesman for the Imperial Household Agency. Hirohito
``is being given another transfusion,'' he added, but did not
specify the amount.
   The monarch's blood pressure fell to 65 over 35 at one point, but
returned to 102 over 46 following the first transfusion, Maeda said.
He added Hirohito's temperature stood at 98.42.
   ``Doctors are closely monitoring'' the emperor's condition, the
spokesman said, quoting Akira Takagi, the chief physician.
   It was the second time the emperor's blood pressure plummeted to
a dangerously low level since he fell ill Sept. 19 after vomiting
blood. On Nov. 8, his blood pressure plunged to 68 over 30 in the
wake of blood discharges. A healthy person has a reading of about
120 over 80.
   Hirohito has been bedridden since he became sick and has bled
intermittently since then.
   Doctors believe the world's longest-reigning monarch is bleeding
mostly in the upper intestinal area where he underwent a bypass
operation in September 1987. In recent days, he has spent most of
his time sleeping and responds very little to questions from aides,
doctors say.
   They have refused to comment on reports the monarch has
pancreatic cancer.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of heavily armed soldiers
agreed to give up their guns and surrender on Sunday, ending a
four-day military revolt, the government said. At least four people
were reported killed in the uprising.
   The army said in a communique that the 500 insurgents who had
been holed up at a military base just outside the capital agreed to
give up their weapons and explosives.
   But the government news agency Telam reported that some rebels
still had refused to surrender at the base, and that some rebels
still laid siege to another military installation at Mercedes, 60
miles west of Buenos Aires.
   At least three civilians and one policeman were killed and 35
people wounded during a clash Sunday between hundreds of anti-rebel
demonstrators and the insurgents, Radio Rivadavia reported Sunday.
   President Raul Alfonsin _ facing the worst threat since his
civilian government replaced military rule in 1983 _ denied that any
deals were made with the rebels.
   The rebels had demanded an overhaul in the military hierarchy, a
bigger military budget, and an end to prosecutions for human rights
abuses committed during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
   ``This has been a really important success,'' Alfonsin told
reporters at Government House. ``There were no concessions of any
kind.
   But a spokesman for the opposition Peronist Party requested a
detailed briefing by Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena about how
the settlement was achieved.
   Earlier, the private Noticias Argentinas and Diarios y Noticias
news agencies said army chief Lt. Gen. Jose Dante Caridi had agreed
to a rebel demand that he resign. Both agencies cited political and
military sources.
   ``The government did not negotiate on an amnesty, changes of
(human rights) trials or any claim by anyone,'' Sen. Antonio
Berhongaray, chairman of the Defense Committee, said.
   ``Democracy Triumphed,'' said a message flashed across the screen
by the five TV stations that had been broadcasting simultaneous news
of the revolt for nearly 24 hours.
   The rebel leader, Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, was arrested, and
the approximately 500 rebels he commanded began to lay down their
weapons, the army said.
   Soldiers immediately began to remove mines and fill in trenches
made by the rebels to defend their positions at the seized Villa
Martelli base on the outskirts of the city.
   Alfonsin had wide support to quell the rebellion and pledged to
``suffocate'' it. But government troops repeatedly refused to attack
or restrict the rebels' movements.
   One government military officer, Gen. Adolfo Patricio Etcheun,
said he and his men agreed with Seineldin's demands and would not
take up arms against the rebels. Etcheun commands the 4th Air
Transport Infantry Brigade.
   The deaths and injuries Sunday occurred outside the entrance of
the Villa Martelli base, about nine miles outside the capital, Radio
Rivadavia said. As loyal troops outside withdrew, hundreds of
pro-government demonstrators converged on the entrance, throwing
firebombs, rocks and bottles, it said.
   Rebels fired back from inside the arsenal, and from two cars that
sped from the scene, the government news agency Telam reported.
   With some government officials calling the revolt a coup attempt,
officials on Saturday called on the public to rally for democracy.
Tens of thousands poured into the streets nationwide.
   The insurrection began Thursday when 53 members of an elite coast
guard unit robbed an arsenal and deserted their base. Officers tried
to incite troops at two other army bases in suburban Buenos Aires.
   On Friday, about 400 troops led by Seineldin rebelled at an
infantry school at the huge Campo de Mayo base about 22 miles
northwest of Buenos Aires.
   Loyal government troops traded weapons fire with the rebels on
Friday and five people were reported wounded.
   But government guns were silent on Saturday, when most of the
troops at Campo de Mayo boarded army trucks and moved to the nearby
Villa Martelli, an arsenal equipped with tanks and explosives.
   The movement by rebel troops without interference from loyalist
soldiers sparked fears that the insurgency was spreading.
   In Buenos Aires, a city of 10 million, five television stations
broadcast public messages urging people to defend democracy.
   The insurrection was reported to have been triggered by the
planned resumption of trials of military officers implicated in a
wave of officially sanctioned terror during the grim years of
junta-run military dictatorships.
   A commission appointed by Alfonsin said nearly 9,000 Argentines
were arrested by security forces and presumed killed.
   In December 1985, a civilian court convicted nine former military
junta members, including former Presidents Jorge Videla and Roberto
Viola, of human rights abuses.
   Such trials were the impetus for similiar military uprisings in
April 1987 and January 1988. The revolts were quelled by Alfonsin's
government.
   Alfonsin became president in 1983 after the military junta _
beleaguered by a horrendous economy and the humiliating defeat by
Britain in the 1982 battle over the Falkland Islands _ allowed
democratic elections.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The elevation of John Sununu and George
Mitchell _ two American politicians of partial Lebanese heritage _
has instilled pride in Arab-Americans wherever they congregate, from
the docks of Seattle and assembly lines of Detroit to the halls of
academia and the conference rooms of Washington.
   ``The process of exclusion that we suffered is now broken,'' said
James Zogby, executive director of the lobbying group Arab American
Institute as he welcomed the election of Democrat Mitchell as Senate
majority leader and the selection by President-elect George Bush of
Republican Sununu as his White House chief of staff. Sununu's term
as governor of New Hampshire ends in early January.
   ``We've managed to remove the taint attached to us and mature as
a community much like the Hispanics and Asians,'' said Zogby.
   Unlike Hispanics, Asians and other minorities, the estimated 2.5
million Arab-Americans carry the burden of antipathy toward their
ethnic group. Attitudes toward them have been affected by the
Arab-Israeli conflict and the strong support Israel enjoys in
Congress.
   Sununu, whose grandfather was Lebanese and who has been active in
the National Association of Arab Americans, learned this political
lesson the hard way.
   His selection by Bush drew anxious reactions from the Jewish
community because of his refusal to endorse a proclamation
condemning a United Nations resolution that pronounced Israel a
racist country. Among the nation's 50 governors, Sununu was the only
one to take that stand. He argued such issues were not within a
governor's domain.
   Sununu apologized at a news conference in Washington after his
selection by Bush, saying he should have signed the petition. He
later met with Jewish leaders to reassure them of his support for
Israel.
   He has long been aware of the pitfalls of public pro-Arab stands.
At a keynote address to the 1984 convention of the NAAA, which
adopted a resolution calling for a cutoff of American aid to Israel,
he exhorted the participants to engage in political activity to
mimic ``the opposition.''
   Without naming the powerful pro-Israel lobby, Sununu talked about
``others with perspectives very different from us who have
influenced the decision-making process in this country to the
detriment of this nation's foreign policy.''
   But he did not go beyond that _ an example, Arab-American leaders
say, of the caution he has found it prudent to exercise.
   ``That's how he and Mitchell got where they are,'' said James
Abourezk, a former Democratic senator from South Dakota who is of
Arab parentage. He heads the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee.
   Mitchell was supported by Jewish voters in Maine in his 1982 and
1988 Senate races, but he has also been quietly involved in Arab
causes such as the American Task Force on Lebanon. Arab-American
organizations rallied behind his candidacy for the Senate leadership
post.
   The task force, in which Sununu was also active, is composed of
American businessmen and politicians seeking to promote a peaceful
solution to Lebanon's crisis and foster economic rehabilitation for
the shattered country.
   People of Lebanese descent constitute the largest group of
Arab-Americans. Their forebears began migrating here at the turn of
the century.
   Sununu and Mitchell aren't alone. Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio,
also of Lebanese descent, is running for the chairmanship of the
House Democratic Caucus.
   Dozens of Arab-Americans hold federal, state and mayoral offices
around the country. Among them: Eva Sayegh Tieg, Virginia's
secretary of human services; Tommy Hazouri, the mayor of
Jacksonville, Fla.; Antony Solomon, state treasurer of Rhode Island;
Michael Baroody, assistant secretary of labor in the Reagan
administration.
   ``They're openly identifying themselves as Arab-Americans,'' said
Zogby, ``whereas a few years ago they wouldn't have mentioned it at
all.''
   Jesse Jackson, the first black leader to make a serious run for
the presidency, gave Arab-Americans a prominent role in his campaign
and championed one of their causes _ the creation of a Palestinian
homeland.
   The recent political successes of Arab-Americans have come from
the political mainstream rather than the fringe. Sununu is a
conservative with impeccable Republican credentials. Mitchell is an
integral part of the political and social establishment, often
riding with Bush on his airplane from Washington to their homes in
Maine.
   In recent years, Arab-Americans have been organizing in labor
unions as an ethnic group: Yemenite longshoremen in the West Coast
port of Seattle, Lebanese Shiite autoworkers in Detroit and Syrian
steelworkers in Pennsylvania.
   They point with pride to such prominent Americans as Beverly
Hills disc jockey Casey Kasem and consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
   ``There's a growing desire of Arab-Americans to identify with
their heritage,'' said Faris Bouhafa, spokesman of the Arab-American
Anti-Discrimination Committee, a civil rights and lobbying group.
   For too long Arabs were ``stereotyped and tainted in this
country. Now we're pointing to our past with pride, teaching our
children Arabic,'' he said.
   Besides providing a morale boost to the Arab-American community,
its leaders hope their political successes will help change what
they view as a skewed U.S. policy in the Middle East.
   Sununu and Mitchell ``will be less susceptible to the
heavy-handed tactics'' of the pro-Israel lobby, said Bouhafa.
   But former Sen. Abourezk cautioned that both men may be too
politically vulnerable to publicly adopt pro-Arab stands ``whatever
they may believe in their hearts.''

   Ten inspectors from the Soviet Union arrived
here Sunday to monitor the burning of Pershing rocket motors at an
Army depot under terms of a nuclear arms reduction treaty.
   The burn was scheduled to begin Monday, weather permitting. The
state health department allows the Army to burn only six rockets per
day, and only when the wind is at least 4 mph from the west.
   Pueblo Army Depot Activity spokesman Alan Kenitzer said 18 rocket
motors probably will be burned this month.
   Similar burns have been taking place since Sept. 8 at the
Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant near Marshall, Texas.
   The Pershings were the delivery systems for European-based
nuclear warheads aimed at the Soviet Union. Under terms of the
intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty that took effect June 1,
the United States has two years to destroy 450 of the missiles, each
of which is propelled by two rocket motors.
   In exchange, the Soviet Union will destroy a larger number of
their medium-range missiles as U.S. inspectors look on.
   Kenitzer said the Soviet inspectors arrived in Pueblo on Sunday
from Travis Air Force Base, Calif. They proceeded to the depot,
about 10 miles east of the city, for a briefing and to mark the
motors to be eliminated, he said.
   They will check for the marks again immediately before the burns
to make sure those motors are the ones destroyed.

   The military mission of space
shuttle Atlantis continued under a shroud of official silence
Sunday, although there were indications the orbiter would not return
to Earth before Tuesday.
   Atlantis is under the command of the Air Force, which has said it
would give 24-hour notice of landing but otherwise maintain silence
unless there is an emergency.
   No word was heard from either NASA or the Air Force by evening of
Sunday, the shuttle's third day in flight, indicating the earliest
day the orbiter would land at Edwards Air Force Base in California
would be Tuesday.
   At a Sunday briefing at Edwards for NASA and Air Force workers
taking part in a simulated landing, a list of activities indicated
Atlantis would return to Earth four to seven days after Friday
morning's blastoff from Cape Canaveral, Fla. That also would suggest
a landing no earlier than Tuesday.
   The Air Force gave no information on whether the five-man
military crew accomplished its main goal: deployment of a powerful
radar satellite designed to gather extremely sharp images of East
Bloc military facilities in all weather.
   The spy satellite would help American intelligence monitor Soviet
compliance with arms treaties. Eventually, it also could serve as
the ``radar eye'' for the new stealth bomber, allowing the jet's
crew to pick out targets without turning on their own radar and
revealing their position.
   Sources said before the flight that the astronauts planned to
deploy the $500 million satellite, reportedly codenamed Lacrosse, on
Saturday.
   The astronauts also were to conduct reconnaissance experiments,
sources said. It was believed they would test a special handheld
optical device that resembles binoculars.
   The experiments were to be coordinated with undisclosed ground
exercises that could include troop maneuvers, naval movements or
missile launches.
   Atlantis is the second shuttle to fly since the Challenger
explosion Jan. 28, 1986, the 27th shuttle mission overall and the
third dedicated to the military.
   Atlantis' crew members are Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson, the
commander; Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner, the pilot; Col.
Richard M. Mullane and Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross of the Air Force, and
Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.

   A commuter train slammed into another train stopped
at a Tokyo station on Monday, killing two people and injuring about
85, authorities said.
   The impact crushed parts of the two cars and derailed several
cars, police said. About 600 people were reported on board the two
trains.
   The collision occurred about 9:40 a.m. (7:40 p.m. EST) at the
Higashi-Nakano Station on the Sobu Line, one of Japan Railways'
surface commuter lines. The station is two stops west of Shinjuku
Station, a major railway and commuter line juncture in west-central
Tokyo.
   The cause of the crash was unknown, but news reports said
westbound trains were running about 10 minutes behind schedule when
one of them smashed into the rear of another west-bound train
stopped in the Higashi-Nakano station.
   A male passenger and the driver of the moving train, 28-year-old
Teruki Hirao, were killed, said a police official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Fire and police officials said about 85 people were injured. The
police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 10 were in
serious condition.
   Fire department rescue teams worked to free people from the
crushed cars. Dazed but injured survivors were rushed to nearby
hospitals.
   Keiko Uehara, who runs a bookstore near the Higashi-Nakano
Station, said the crash made such a noise that ``I thought a
building had fallen down.''
   The accident was the first causing injuries on Tokyo commuter
trains since March 1986, when about 60 people were hurt in the
collision of two trains.
   The last previous fatal accident was in December 1984, when a
train driver was killed and at least 120 people injured in the
head-on collision of two trains.

   Former President Carlos Andres Perez
was elected to a five-year term on Sunday, returning to the office
he held a decade ago by focusing on the prosperity of the past.
   The Supreme Electoral Council declared that Perez, based on small
early returns, would win the election over his main opponent,
conservative Eduardo Fernandez of the Social Christian Party.
   Perez previously served from 1974 to 1979. By law, a president
may not to return to office for 10 years.
   Perez, 66, is to succeed President Jaime Lusinchi, also a member
of the Democratic Action party.
   The victory gives the left-of-center party two consecutive
victories during this wealthy oil-exporting nation's worst economic
crisis in decades.
   Perez also becomes the first president to win a second term since
the ouster of military rule in 1958.
   ``This is the point of departure for building a bigger Venezuela.
The next government must take advantage of our situation to form the
bases for future growth,'' Perez said on national television.
   Fernandez, 48, conceded defeat within minutes after the council's
announcement.
   ``I offer (Perez) constructive but firm opposition that will put
the interests of Venezuela above particular interests,'' Fernandez
said on television.
   The first report from the elections council, based on only 1,919
votes, gave Perez 914 votes, or 47.6 percent. It said Fernandez had
811 votes, or 42.2 percent. The elections council, however, declared
Perez the winner.
   Perez was forecast the winner hours earlier by the major
television networks, which gave the former president a huge lead
based on exit polls.
   Venevision projected nearly 3.9 million votes for Perez, or 54.1
percent, to 2.7 million for Fernandez, or 33.7 percent.
   No official tallies were given on the outcome of voting for the
all-new National Congress of 182 deputies and 44 senators, but the
private networks projected the Democratic Action party would win
48.6 percent and the Social Christians 26.3 percent in both houses.
   Voting is mandatory in Venezuela, but private projections
projected that 15 percent of the 9 million eligible voters did not
cast ballots.
   A high abstention rate was widely predicted because of general
voter dissatisfaction with both major candidates.
   Perez is closely identified with the good economic times of the
1970s, when the Arab oil embargo helped stimulate rapid growth and
prosperity. He nationalized foreign oil holdings in Venezuela during
his presidency.
   His previous five-year term was dogged by charges of corruption,
however.
   Perez, a charismatic figure popular with the working class,
favors tighter state control over the economy. Fernandez favors a
freer market.
   There are 23 other presidential candidates on the ballot, but
none was given a chance to beat either of the two big parties.
   Lusinchi's five-year term was one of economic decline in a
country battered by the drop in oil prices. Oil makes up 90 percent
of the country's exports.
   The new president, to be inaugurated in February, will face
growing poverty in what has been Latin America's richest nation. The
standard of living is still one of the highest in the region but it
has been reduced by inflation and devaluations since 1982.
   Since 1984, the nation's income from oil was halved to an
expected $7.1 billion this year, while foreign debt payments have
continued at a rate of about $5 billion a year during Lusinchi's
term. The debt stands at $33 billion.
   The depressed economic climate helped lead to one of the most
unenthusiastic campaigns in Venezuela's 30 years of democracy.
Public rallies drew mainly the party faithful.
   In addition to their financial woes, voters have also been
disenchanted with widesread corruption in government and the
perception that neither Perez nor Fernandez will do anything about
it.
   Perez promised price controls and wage increases. He also called
for ``selective economic growth'' by pushing non-oil exports such as
gold, aluminum, and steel.

   President-elect George Bush paid a tribute to
his ``trusted friend'' President Reagan in a surprise appearance
Sunday night at a salute to this year's winners of the Kennedy
Center honors.
   Joining a parade of stars ranging from Helen Hayes to Kathleen
Turner on the stage of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts in the finale of the annual gala, Bush looked up toward the
presidential box and spoke a few lines from ``Auld Lang Syne.''
   The lines were:
   ``So here's a hand, my trusted friend;
   ``Give me a hand of thine;
   ``We'll take a cup of kindness yet
   ``For Auld Lang Syne.''
   Bush then joined those on stage and in the audience in singing
the traditional song of memories.
   From the box, Reagan called back that it was better than winning
an Academy Award, an honor he never received or was nominated for
during his Hollywood career.
   Earlier, at a black-tie reception at the White House, Reagan told
the five Kennedy Center honorees that it was ``a night for all
Americans to celebrate the glory that you have given us.''
   ``Your contribution to our national culture has been more
precious than the most precious of rubies,'' the president said.
   Those honored join 52 others who have received similar
recognition since the awards were instituted in 1978.
   This year's honorees were:
   _ Alvin Ailey, founder of the predominantly black Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater, which will open its 30th anniversary season
at the New York City Center on Wednesday. At 57, Ailey is one of the
youngest persons ever to receive the honor. Beverly Sills was 56
when honored in 1985 and Leontyne Price 53 in 1980. Reagan said
Ailey had ``brought a new vocabulary to American dance.''
   _ Comedian George Burns, who starred with his wife, Gracie Allen,
in the Burns and Allen comedy show on radio and television from 1932
to 1958. In more recent years, Burns made a comeback in movies,
including an Academy Award-winning performance in ``The Sunshine
Boys.'' At 92, Burns is one of the oldest persons to receive the
honor. Director George Abbott was honored at 95 in 1982 and actress
Lynn Fontanne at 93 in 1980. Burns entered the East Room assisted by
White House aides at each arm. The 77-year-old president joked that
Burns is ``the only man in America older than I am.''
   _ Actress Myrna Loy, 83, best known for 14 films she made in 13
years with the late William Powell, including the ``Thin Man''
detective series. Ms. Loy also has been active in liberal Democratic
politics. In her autobiography, she said of Reagan as president,
``Ronald Reagan has lived up to my expectations, which were not very
great.'' Ms. Loy walked to the podium with the aid of a cane.
Speaking of Ms. Loy's many roles, the president, a former film actor
himself, said, ``She made it all seem easy, which I don't need to
tell all of you is the hardest thing of all.''
   _ Alexander Schneider, 80, the Russian-born violinist who moved
to the United States in 1938 as a member of the Budapest Quartet and
later founded the Albeneri Trio and the Schneider Quartet. Schneider
has been a champion of contemporary music. Reagan saluted him for
his work in teaching other musicians in addition to his own
performing.
   _ Roger L. Stevens, 78, chairman of the board of trustees of the
Kennedy Center from 1961 to 1988, arts assistant to President
Johnson from 1964 to 1968, chairman of the National Endowment for
the Arts from 1965 to 1969 and a theatrical producer who brought
works by such writers as Eugene O'Neill, Tennessee Williams, Harold
Pinter and T.S. Eliot to the stage in London and New York. Reagan
said Stevens ``brought hundreds of plays to the boards, from popular
musical comedies to difficult modern works.''
   The Kennedy Center Honors Gala is a fund-raising benefit to
support special projects of the center, including performing arts
education and public service programs.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo carried out a
broad cabinet shakeup Monday to sweep away the tainted legacy of
former President Chun Doo-hwan, who went into retreat after
apologizing for abuses during his regime.
   Roh named as his new premier Kang Young-hoon, a U.S.-educated
lawmaker in the governing party. Kang replaces Lee Hyun-jae.
   The president promised last month to remove the vestiges of the
Chun Cabinet to help sooth public anger over Chun's authoritarian
rule.
   Chun stepped down as president last February. On Nov. 23, he went
into self-imposed internal exile after publicly apologizing for
corruption and repression during his seven-year rule. He has denied
personal wrongdoing, however.
   Roh replaced all but three posts in the 23-member Cabinet.
   Kang, 66, a lawmaker of the governing Democratic Justice Party,
was forced to retire as superintendent of the Korean Military
Academy in 1961 when he opposed Park Chung-hee, who ousted the
civilian government in a military coup.
   He later went to the United States and earned a doctorate in
political science at Southern California University. He served as
ambassador to Britain and the Holy See in the early 1980s.
   Cho Soon, a 60-year-old U.S.-educated economist, was made deputy
prime minister and also economic plannmg minister to replace Rha
Woong-bae.
   The president also named ambassador to Saudi Arabia, 58-year-old
Choi Ho-joong, as the new foreign minister. He succeeds Choi
Kwang-soo.
   Retired Gen. Lee Sang-hoon became defense minister. He was vice
commander of the Korea-U.S. Combined Forces in 1985 before retiring.

<HEAD>Beleaguered Michoacan Governor To Leave For Federal Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDAJOY FENLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protesters who seized dozens of city halls
celebrated Sunday after President Carlos Salinas de Gortari removed
a state governor whose ouster they had demanded.
   Salinas gave Michoacan state Gov. Luis Martinez Villacina a new
job as director of Federal Toll Highways and Bridges, the Excelsior
news service reported Saturday. As such, he will be in charge of
collecting tolls on federal highways.
   Leftist protesters, who backed the leading rival to Salinas in
July presidential elections, took control of about 30 Michoacan city
halls on Nov. 26 to demand the ouster of Martinez Villacina. He
belongs to the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   The protestors from the National Democratic Front, a coalition
that supported Cuauhtemoc Cardenas for president, said Martinez
Villacina had ``squandered the public treasury'' and ``fomented
political hatred'' in the north central state.
   Demonstrators at city hall in the provincial city of Uruapan were
jubilant Sunday that the governor was gone, said protester Uriel
Lopez Paredes. ``We set off firecrackers and danced. We had a
party.''
   A red ribbon was tied around city hall, but Francisco Curi Perez
said that the 100 people still inside planned to stay. Curi Perez, a
federal deputy for the Democratic Front, said the demonstrators want
at least four mayors in the region who belong to the governing party
to resign.
   ``They used government funds for (Institutional Revolutionary
Party) candidates,'' he said.
   Although federal police peacefully evicted protestors from 25
city halls within the first two days of the protests, activists
still occupied several city halls during the weekend. Many were also
pressing local issues and had vowed to remain, like those of Uruapan.
   However, Democratic Front Senator Christobal Arias Solis said
Salinas' decision to name Martinez Villacina to a federal post could
end the state's political battle, Excelsior reported.
   The Michoacan state Congress is expected to name the interim
governor Monday or Tuesday, according to Excelsior. Meanwhile,
Genovevo Figueroa, state secretary-general, will act as governor.
   Arias Solis said the new governor should either be a supporter of
Cardenas or ``at least someone who will govern for all the people,''
the news service reported.
   Michoacan voters in July supported Cardenas, a former Michoacan
state governor who came in second to Salinas.
   Salinas, elected with the narrowest margin of victory in the
governing party's 59-year history, was inaugurated Thursday.
Cardenas has been challenging the election results, which he says
are fraudulent.

<HEAD>OPEC Accord Should Spur Development of Some North Sea Fields</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher oil prices from OPEC's latest accord should
spur the development of new North Sea oilfields that British
companies now find too expensive to exploit, analysts say.
   But the agreement may have little overall effect on the British
economy, despite the fact that Britain is one of the world's major
oil producers.
   The 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
reached an oil output agreement last week aimed at boosting crude
oil prices by at least 40 percent in 1989. The six-month accord,
which takes effect in January, sets a total output level of 18.5
million barrels a day and a target price of $18 a barrel.
   The analysts said there was no chance that Britain would join
other non-OPEC producers, including Mexico and Norway, in
cooperating with OPEC by voluntarily cutting back production.
   Norway, the other major North Sea oil producer, has told Britain
it plans to continue a voluntary 7.5 percent production cut it
imposed last year even though its production is rising because of
new fields coming into operation, said a government source, speaking
on condition he was not identified.
   ``This Conservative government we've got at the moment is very
hostile to OPEC,'' said Fergus MacLeod, energy analyst at Barclays
de Zoete Wedd Ltd. ``I think a Labor government would consider
cooperating with OPEC along the lines of Norway, but not under
Margaret Thatcher.''
   He said the major impact of the OPEC agreement will be ``higher
average oil prices in 1989 than would otherwise be the case and a
greater confidence that oil prices will not stabilize in single
digits.
   ``That means that some of the North Sea developments which are
marginal at current oil prices are likely to go ahead,'' MacLeod
said.
   Gareth Lewis-Davies, an Edinburgh-based analyst for the
investment firm County NatWest WoodMac, said: ``A high oil price is
good for oil companies. And that means some new developments which
were uneconomic are now going to be economic.''
   The Department of Energy said it had approved the development of
24 new fields, at an investment cost of more than $5 billion in 1988
_ a record number.
   ``It's good news,'' said Lewis-Davies, ``but these are generally
small fields and the amount of oil is getting less and less.''
   Britain now produces about 2.3 million barrels a day and ranks as
the world's seventh largest oil producer behind the Soviet Union,
the United States, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, China and Iran, he said.
   This would make one believe that higher oil prices would benefit
Britain, Lewis-Davies said, but because oil plays such a small part
in the economy, lower oil prices are more beneficial to the majority
of business and industry.
   ``The critical thing,'' he said, ``is whether the United Kingdom
is an oil country and whether sterling is a petrocurrency, and the
answer I think is no.''
   ``Only a very small percentage of Britain's gross domestic
product is derived from oil. Similarly, capital investment in oil is
only a small percentage of the whole. So, a low oil price has helped
the rest of Britain's non-oil economy,'' he said.
   The OPEC agreement will have little impact on Britain's trade
deficit and inflation rate, said Bill Martin, chief economist at the
investment firm Phillips and Drew Ltd.
   Even a $5 hike in oil prices would only cut Britain's expected
$28 billion current account deficit in 1988 by about $925 million
and add a 0.25 percentage point to the inflation rate, which is now
at 6.4 percent, he said. The current account includes invisible
trade such as services.
   ``This is not significant,'' Martin said.
   The analysts agreed that the major impact on North Sea production
had been the July explosion and fire on Occidental Petroleum's Piper
Alpha platform in the North Sea, which killed 167 people.
   The disaster took a major oilfield out of operation, which
Lewis-Davies said has resulted in a 16 percent drop in expected 1988
production.
   ``Oil production in Britain is not readily affected by the price
of oil, the reason being that the price of producing in the North
Sea is way below the price at the moment,'' he said.
   A recent County Natwest WoodMac survey found that 95 percent of
British oil production costs less than $7.40 a barrel, including
about 60 percent which costs $3.70 or less, he said.
   Brent crude, the main blend of North Sea oil, was selling for
$14.50 a barrel on Friday.

<HEAD>Mexico Welcomes OPEC Pact but Banks On A Weak Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of criticizing OPEC
overproduction that crippled its oil income, Mexico applauded the
cartel's new production accord and planned a reduction in its own
exports that may help make the pact work.
   ``We're ready to collaborate with other independents and work
with OPEC to strengthen the market,'' Energy Department spokesman
Alfredo Cortina said.
   An OPEC team will visit Mexico shortly to negotiate reductions.
Energy Secretary Fernando Hiriart said Mexico was willing to cut its
1.35 million-barrel daily production to help shore up world market
prices.
   The agreement reached last week by the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries calls for a cartel export ceiling of
18.5 million barrels daily, roughly 4 million barrels below
estimated current production.
   Still, Mexico is wary of OPEC's ability to discipline itself and
is not banking on any miraculous recovery in global markets.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's first budget, to be
presented to the nation's Congress Dec. 15, assumes target prices
for Mexican oil of only $10 per barrel, according to foreign
economists.
   The budget also projects a small export cut to 1.3 million
barrels per day in 1989, according to the financial newspaper El
Financiero and economists.
   That would put projected oil income for the year to just under $5
billion. If prices rise to $12.25 a barrel, Mexico would earn
another $1 billion.
   Any market improvement would prove a windfall for an economy
struggling to cope with a $102 billion foreign debt.
   Mexico, the world's sixth-largest oil producer, is not a member
of OPEC but usually followed the cartel's pricing and production
guidelines.
   But when prices for Mexican crudes dropped to around $9 a barrel,
Hiriart announced Mexico was abandoning that policy. He said
overproduction by cartel members had rendered its market quotas
useless.
   Mexico had reason for threatening to go it alone. Former
President Miguel de la Madrid's 1988 budget was based on oil prices
staying at $15 a barrel and earning $7.1 billion for the year. By
July, Energy Department officials acknowledged Mexico had lost $2
billion in anticipated revenues.
   At current prices, total 1988 oil income will reach $5.5 billion,
well below 1987's $8.6 billion figure, according to the Center for
Private Sector Economic Studies.
   The government says oil generated $4.7 billion between January
and August, just over half that earned by non-oil exports. While a
newly diversified export base cushioned the shortfall, it hasn't
been enough to prevent Mexico from running a monthly trade deficit
since September.
   Depressed market prices and rising international interest rates
acted like a vise on Mexico's ability to meet its 1988 debt service
of $14 billion. Each $1 drop in the price of oil deprives Mexico of
$500 million in revenue, while interest rate hikes of 1 percent add
another $750 million to its debt bill.
   Reduced oil income also contributed to a drain on foreign
reserves currently used to support an anti-inflationary peso
currency freeze against the dollar. Mexican reserves plummeted from
$16 billion in April to below $10 billion in October, according to
private estimates.
   Salinas pledged to link Mexico's debt servicing to its oil
earnings, trade concessions abroad, or both. Mexican officials plan
to use the weak petroleum market as an added bargaining chip when
rescheduling negotiations begin early next year.
   ``We don't expect oil prices to fall by much in 1989. But if they
do, the new Mexican authorities will try to neutralize the impact
with more borrowing or by suspending or reducing debt servicing,''
said Abel Beltran del Rio, executive director of the consulting firm
Ciemex-Wefa.
   ``De la Madrid dealt with the oil shock by absorbing it through
less growth and more austerity, del Rio said. ``Under the new
administration, it won't be absorbed but neutralized.''
   While displaying a tough negotiating posture on the debt front,
Mexico has chosen to adopt a newly conciliatory tone towards OPEC
producers. Hiriart's offer to reduce Mexican exports indicated that
Mexico views the OPEC pact as an opportunity it can ill afford to
lose.

   Ames Department Stores Inc. is expected to close about 75 of the
392 Zayre discount store outlets it purchased in September,
published reports said.
   The Boston Globe and the Hartford Courant said the closings of
the stores, which were described as unprofitable, were to be
announced Monday.
   Rosemary Keogh O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the Rocky Hill,
Conn.-based Ames, said the company would not confirm or deny the
reports.
   Most of the stores earmarked for closing are in Georgia,
Louisiana, South Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama, along with six in
Wisconsin. Ames, of Rocky Hill, Conn., is closing three of its own
outlets, leaving a total of 840 combined stores.
   Zayre Corp. sold its discount store division to Ames in September
for $775 million. The stores had been losing money for some time.
   The deal left Zayre with two divisions, the TJX Cos., which
includes the T.J. Maxx, Hit or Miss and Chadwick's stores, and the
wholesale division, which includes B.J.'s Wholesale Club and
HomeClub.

<HEAD>Harris Corp. Fires 280, More Layoffs Expected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harris Corp., which recently bought the
semi-conductor business of General Electric Co., has laid off 280
workers and offered severance packages to thousands of other
employees.
   The layoffs, which total about 4 percent of the 6,500 workers at
Harris' Government Systems Sector here, were hastened by the
high-tech company's loss of a contract t develop the Tracking and
Data Relay Satellite System ground terminal for NASA.
   But company spokesman James Murphy said the firings announced
Friday were the result of the slowdown in expected military business.
   Securities analysts have speculated at least 800 jobs would be
eliminated overall in the first wave of layoffs following Harris
$206 million purchase of GE's solid state semiconductor business.
   The semiconductor division lost $30 million in the year ended
June 30 and $11.9 million in the following quarter.
   The merger, completed Nov. 30, made Harris the nation's
sixth-largest semiconductor company.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. telecommunications analyst Maria
Lewis said she expected Harris to announce one or more plant
closings early next year and a staff reduction of at least 10
percent.
   The company's semiconductor operation employing 8,000 people is
based here and has facilities in Findlay, Ohio, Mountaintop, Pa.,
and Santa Clara, Calif. The corporation employs 33,000 worldwide.
   ``Mergers of this magnitude inevitably involve substantial
organizational changes and adjustments to head count,'' said Jon E.
Cornell, senior vice president of Harris Semiconductor Sector.
   The layoffs are mostly a reflection of Harris management's
reluctance to sacrifice profits for the payroll, Ms. Lewis said,
noting that John T. Hartley, chairman and chief executive officer,
has pledged to stockholders to keep profits rising at double-digit
rates even while sales gains are modest.

<HEAD>Chairman Will Retire At Company Tied To Defense Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Sundstrand Corp. is
stepping down less than two months after the company agreed to pay a
record $127.3 million in fines for overcharging the government on
defense contracts.
   Evans W. Erikson, 62, once listed by Forbes magazine as one of
the most powerful industrial executives in the nation, said Friday
he is retiring from the aerospace-products manufacturer to ``pursue
personal interests.''
   Erikson, a 36-year veteran of Sundstrand, will leave the company
at the end of December.
   Erikson's positions as chairman and chief executive officer will
be split between two of his top deputies.
   Don R. O'Hare, 66, vice chairman through Erikson's eight years in
command, moves up to chairman, while Harry C. Stonecipher, 52,
president and chief operating officer, who came to Sundstrand from
General Electric Co. two years ago, will serve as chief executive
officer.
   In a separate release issued at the same time, Erikson announced
he has promoted corporate Treasurer Paul Donovan, 41, who joined the
company in June, to vice president of finance.
   ``Now that the company has resolved the criminal investigation of
its government contracting practices, it is an appropriate time for
me to pursue personal interests,'' Erikson said in a statement.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Keith Syfert said a grand jury is still
considering possible indictments against some company officials. He
declined to say if Erikson's resignation is related to the
investigation.
   Sundstrand, which manufactures electronic, mechanical and
hydraulic systems for the government and civilian aerospace
industries, has 14,500 employees at 19 sites in various states.
   In an apparently unrelated move, the company also confirmed that
it had laid off another 32 office employees as part of a
restructuring move that has been going on for the past year.
   The company said that more than 300 white-collar employees have
been laid off since last December.
   In its recent third-quarter report to stockholders, Sundstrand
warned them to brace for a possible $39.2 million in penalties the
federal government might levy on top of the $127 million the company
has already agreed to pay.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas recently said the additional fines
apparently would involve civil issues that were not resolved by the
settlement of criminal charges filed by the government.
   Sundstrand pleaded guilty earlier this year in Rockford to four
counts of defrauding the Defense Department by overbilling on
aircraft parts. It also pleaded guilty in Seattle to mischarging on
government contracts.
   In the October plea agreement, Sundstrand also admitted to
lavishing gifts and gratuities on government employees and military
personnel involved in its contract bidding, as well as billing the
government for trips and other perks of company executives. No names
have been divulged.
   The Pentagon suspended the company from bidding on government
contracts after it admitted to engaging in the largest military
fraud in U.S. history.
   In addition, the State Department reportedly is delaying approval
of export licenses required to send Sundstrand products overseas.

<HEAD>Steelworkers, Aluminum Companies Reach `Historic' Tentative
Contract</HEAD>

   Negotiators for the United Steelworkers of
America and Alcoa and Reynolds Metals reached a tentative agreement
over the weekend on a 3{-year contract that includes a first-ever
profit-sharing plan for 9,300 workers.
   The contract, subject to a Dec. 9 rank-and-file vote, also offers
the largest salary and benefits package in the recent history of the
aluminum industry, officials said Saturday.
   The 43-month contract would take effect June 1, 1989, after the
current contract expires.
   ``This contract reflects improvements in the companies' profits
and the success that they're enjoying,'' union spokesman Gary
Hubbard, who spoke by phone from the union's headquarters in
Pittsburgh. ``We're confident our members will approve it.''
   Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, employs 6,000 steelworkers union
members at six plants in North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and
Arkansas.
   Reynolds' 3,300 employees work at plants in Virginia, Arkansas,
Texas, Missouri, Illinois, Washington state and Florida.
   Both companies are rebounding from a six-year struggle against
weak world aluminum prices, which rose this year to $1.12 a pound
after plunging to about 45 cents a pound in 1986, Alcoa spokesman
Alfred Posti said.
   Alcoa underwent a massive restructuring from 1983 to 1985 that
involved reducing its worldwide smelting operations by 25 percent,
he said.
   But this year, ``it should be a record year, no doubt about it,''
Posti said.
   Reynolds is likely to gross a record $5 billion in sales in 1988,
said spokesman William Conley.
   The pact was hammered out during three days of talks in
Cincinnati.
   The profit-sharing plan would allow workers to receive a share of
the company's profits if earnings exceed a specified return of
stockholder equity, Posti said. The plan would net workers about
$2,500 each for 1988, he said.
   The new contract also calls for a wage increase of 50
cents-per-hour, Hubbard said.
   In 1986, when the benchmark price for aluminum plunged to about
45 cents a pound, Alcoa and Reynolds steelworkers agreed to a
95-cent-an-hour pay cut, he said.

   A survey of U.S. firms released on Sunday found
they planned to keep on hiring new workers at a strong pace during
the first quarter.
   The survey, conducted by Manpower Inc., a temporary employment
agency, found 22 percent of nearly 14,000 employers planned to
increase hiring from January through March, while 64 percent said
there would be no change in their plans and 11 percent said they
would decrease hiring.
   The respondents included private companies and government
agencies.
   A year ago, 21 percent of the respondents planned to increase
hiring, and 12 percent said they would decrease it during the first
quarter of 1988.
   On Friday, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate rose
to 5.4 percent in November from October's 5.3 percent. The
government also reported 463,000 new jobs were created, indicating
the economy continues to be robust.
   Manpower said hiring demand appeared to be strong in all
industries except in construction and wholesale and retail trade.
However, the survey found the seasonal drop in hiring in wholesale
and retail trade, which follows the Christmas holidays, would be
less than usual.
   The survey also found hiring demand was strong in the South and
West while dipping slightly in the Northeast from the levels of
first quarter 1988. Demand improved in the Midwest, Manpower said.
   Manpower conducts the survey of employers' hiring plans
quarterly. The latest survey was conducted by telephone during the
last two weeks of November, and queried employers in 423 cities
across the country.

   Syracuse grabbed its typical big lead
against Louisiana Tech, but this time it nearly cost the Orangemen
their own tournament.
   ``We went ahead 22-3 and thought we had them. That's the worst
thing a player can do,'' said Syracuse forward Stephen Thompson
after the fourth-ranked Orangemen held off Louisiana Tech in
overtime to take a 106-98 victory Sunday in the 12th annual Carrier
Classic.
   ``When you let a good team like that back into the game, it
builds their confidence. Once they got confident, they were hard to
stop,'' said Thompson, who led Syracuse with 25 points.
   Guard Matt Roe agreed that Syracuse's 23-point lead in the first
half almost proved to be its downfall.
   ``I think we rested on our laurels and coasted some,'' said Roe,
who also had 25 points.
   ``But I think our defense broke down and Derrick (Coleman)
getting into foul trouble didn't help,'' he added.
   Coleman sparked Syracuse's triumph, scoring six of his 23 points
in the overtime period.
   ``I wanted to play great defense and help out offensively. I
don't like losing. I was determined to make sure we gutted it out,''
said Coleman, who also had 14 rebounds.
   Louisiana Tech senior center Randy White said the key to the
Bulldogs' comeback was when Coleman went to the bench four minutes
into the second half with his fourth personal foul.
   ``We didn't do a good job early, they were getting easy buckets
and threw off our rhythym,'' White said. ``That's the thing about us
_ we don't give up. But the main key was to get Coleman out of the
ballgame.''
   Louisiana Tech forward Byron Newton sent the game into overtime
with a 3-point shot as time expired in regulation play. Newton's
shot came after Coleman missed the front end of a 1-and-1 with five
seconds to play.
   Syracuse won the tournament for the 10th time and improved its
record to 7-0. Louisiana Tech fell to 3-1.
   The Orangemen hit their first 11 shots, racing to a 24-5 lead,
and appeared headed for another easy game. Syracuse built a 35-12
cushion midway through the half and took a 54-36 lead at halftime.
   But Louisiana Tech outscored Syracuse 23-11 in the opening five
minutes of the second half to cut the deficit to 65-59 with 15:20 to
play.
   White then took over for the Bulldogs, keeping them close with
his 20 second-half points. White finished with 29 points before
fouling out with five seconds to play.
   Coleman, playing with four personals, kept Syracuse in the lead
with several clutch shots, but missed the free throw that could have
clinched the game for the Orangemen.
   Thompson and Roe led Syracuse with 25 points apiece. Roe scored
five of his points in overtime.
   Senior guard Darryl Knight had 23 points for Louisiana Tech,
while Newton finished with 17.

<HEAD>Price Drops To Under $1 For First Time Since Early July</HEAD>

   Average gasoline prices at pumps across the
nation decreased almost half a cent in the past two weeks, dropping
to under $1 for the first time since early July, an analyst said
Sunday.
   The Lundberg Survey, a sampling of 12,000 service stations
nationwide, found the average retail price of gasoline was 99.61
cents on Dec. 2, said analyst Trilby Lundberg.
   ``There could be some further price slippage,'' she said.
   The price reflects a stable wholesale market that saw little
fluctuation in prices despite continuing talks between members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``OPEC discussions don't, in and of themselves, alter supply and
demand,'' Ms. Lundberg said. ``So as a result, the average wholesale
for the nation last week showed virtually no change at all.''
   The average retail price, which dropped 0.45 cents, includes all
grades of self- and full-serve gasoline, all taxes, and all cash and
credit sales.
   On Dec. 2, the average price at self-serve pumps for regular
unleaded gasoline was 89.80 cents a gallon; for premium unleaded
105.65; and for regular leaded 86.84 cents.
   The average price at full-serve pumps for regular unleaded
gasoline was 118.99 cents per gallon; for premium unleaded 130.08;
and regular leaded 115.76.
   On Nov. 18, the overall price was $1.0006.
   Although the OPEC meeting caused great movement in spot prices,
Ms. Lundberg said supply and demand will determine the market.
   ``Mainstream wholesale and spot markets leaped at the news that
OPEC had reached unity,'' she said. ``It's a very volatile
situation, but underlying all of this excitement and volatility is a
supply more abundant apparently than demand.''
   ``No matter what the importance of what they (OPEC) were saying,
that did not change existing supply and demand patterns,'' she said.

farm trade; picks up 5th graf pvs `The United....'

<TEXT>
   A U.S. crusade to eliminate all subsidies that
distort farm trade ran into heavy opposition Sunday on the eve of
free-trade talks among more than 100 nations.
   The conflict over farm trade threatened to block progress on a
wide range of other issues on the U.S. agenda, from trade in
services to protection of intellectual property.
   Trade ministers are meeting here to give a political push to
negotiations at the midpoint of the four-year Uruguay Round of
free-trade talks. They are the biggest and most ambitious of the
eight rounds that have been held since the formation of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade after World War II.
   The European Economic Community, which is considered the biggest
offender in the expensive area of farm supports, repeated on Sunday
its opposition to a total elimination of trade-distorting subsidies.
   Canadian Trade Minister David Crosbie characterized both the
American and the European stands as ``extreme.''
   If Americans expect progress on intellectual property and
services without achieving an accord on farm trade, ``They're in for
a shock,'' said Michael Duffy, minister for trade negotiations for
Australia. Duffy said that unless things change, he expected ``a
stalemate that will sour the rest of the round.''
   Australia leads the 13-nation Cairns Group, which favors
immediate steps to reduce farm subsidies as a way to avoid an
impasse between the U.S. and EEC positions.
   But possibly preparing for a stalemate, the director general of
GATT said the talks that formally begin Monday could be regarded as
a success even if they fail to produce agreement on certain
contentious issues.
   This week's talks could at least ``stop the hide-and-seek game''
by nailing down areas of disagreement and setting an agenda for
negotiations over the next two years, Arthur Dunkel, the GATT chief,
said in a news conference Sunday.
   The United States has encountered opposition from some developing
countries to the two other main items on its agenda: free trade in
services such as banking, insurance and legal services; and better
international protection of intellectual property such as patents
and copyrights.
   Agreement is considered almost assured on other areas such as
speeding up and strengthening GATT's method of resolving disputes,
and linking GATT to other international bodies such as the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund.
   Dunkel's comment seemed intended in part to prepare public
opinion for the possibility that the Montreal talks will end with
wide gaps remaining over vital issues.
   The comment also dovetailed with statements by U.S. negotiators,
who have said they would rather leave Montreal with no agreement
than with a bad agreement on vital issues.
   A sloppy compromise, the Americans say, would only make it more
difficult to achieve progress in the remaining two years of the
Uruguay Round.
   The GATT midterm review includes representatives of 105
countries, including 96 member nations of the GATT.
   The United States estimates that worldwide, farm subsidies cost
$200 billion a year.
   The 12-nation EEC, or Common Market, has said it is willing to
roll back subsidies. But because of intense pressure from its 11
million farmers, the EEC has been unwilling to agree to their total
elimination.
   ``The American option is a non-starter,'' Frans Andriessen, EEC
agriculture commissioner, said in a news conference Sunday. ``We
will in this negotiation stick to our basic principle.''
   The current Uruguay Round of talks began in Punta del Este,
Uruguay, in 1986 and is scheduled to end in 1990.
   The GATT is both an agreement and an organization which has a
permanent headquarters in Geneva.
   The talks are taking place, as usual, largely behind closed
doors. They are expected to last until Thursday.
