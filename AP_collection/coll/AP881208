   The earthquake that devastated Soviet
Armenia and caused an estimated 50,000 deaths jolted California's
Armenians into action Thursday, donating thousands of dollars to an
impromptu emergency relief fund.
   ``We need to raise millions,'' said Annig Zindarsian, an
executive of the Armenian Relief Society, which is coordinating the
relief effort with the International Red Cross. ``You can imagine
the devastation there, what it will take ... just to help the people
there.''
   An early morning donor contributed $5,000 to the fund, which was
quickly matched by another donor who learned of the contribution
while standing in the ARS office, said Zindarsian.
   A Fresno surgeon has offered to fly to Soviet Armenia and donate
his skills, and another private benefactor has donated use of four
airplanes to transport supplies from the U.S. to Armenia, she said.
Other needs include blankets, tents, warm winter clothing, food and
medicine, said Zindarsian.
   California is home to about 300,000 people of Armenian descent.
Many live in Southern California, the nation's largest Armenian
community. Another 20,000 live in the San Francisco Bay area.
   In Sacramento, Gov. George Deukmejian, of Armenian descent,
referred to recent political unrest in the region.
   ``The additional turmoil associated with a devastating earthquake
has certainly disrupted the lives of thousands, if not millions of
people,'' he said. ``We are all very concerned about the victims of
this natural disaster and our thoughts and prayers are with them
during this very difficult time.''
   In Southern California, the Western Prelacy of the Armenian
Apostolic Church announced that eight days of mourning would begin
Friday, and that local Armenian churches would hold special requiem
services on Friday and Sunday.
   Archbishop Datev Sarkissian said local Armenians are dazed by the
reports, listing up to 50,000 dead.
   Residents of Fresno, which has one of the state's largest
Armenian populations, are being asked for donations to a special
Earthquake Relief Fund established by the local Armenian National
Committee chapter.

   Hurricane-force winds from the desert blasted
Southern California on Wednesday, collapsing a three-story apartment
under construction, blowing the roofs off homes and knocking over a
motor home.
   ``We've had reports of power poles blowing over, lines down. Just
a while ago a man said he had a piece of 2-by-12 construction lumber
blow right through his roof,'' said Senior Deputy Gary Westmoreland,
spokesman for the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department in the
foothill community of Rancho Cucamonga, which appeared to be hardest
hit.
   No serious injuries were reported, he said.
   The Santa Ana winds, which blow out of the desert every fall and
winter, were clocked at 80 mph at the Rialto Airport, said Marti
Higgins, emergency services coordinator for Rancho Cucamonga.
   In that San Bernardino County community, the winds collapsed a
three-story apartment building under construction and blew the roofs
off at least two homes.
   Reports of 55 mph winds came from California State University,
Northridge and Point Mugu near Ventura, the National Weather Service
said. Winds to 40 mph were reported in Ontario and to 44 mph in
Blythe, near the California-Nevada Border.
   Small fires were reported throughout the night in Rancho
Cucamonga, but all were under control, Ms. Higgins said.
   Earlier in the day, an apartment under construction in Rancho
Cucamonga collapsed in the gale, said Fire Department spokeswoman
Kim Agueayo.
   ``They said it's a real mess out there and that it was
wind-related,'' Ms. Agueayo said.
   In Hollywood on Wednesday evening, wind-fanned flames gutted a
two-story home and leaped to a neighboring residence. Two dozen
firefighters battled the blaze, said city fire spokesman Greg
Acevedo.
   In the Orange County city of Santa Ana, a tree was blown over
onto a car.
   Winds blew between 40 and 50 mph in the mountains and coastal
areas and gusted up to 60 mph in the canyons, the National Weather
Service reported.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
urging an end to ``suspicions and the legacies of the past,'' called
Wednesday for international cooperation on the environment, space
and Afghanistan in a dramatic U.N. speech punctuated by his pledge
to reduce Moscow's troops.
   Gorbachev, in an upbeat visit to New York that mixed business
with tourism, said President-elect George Bush ``will find in us a
partner who is ready _ without long pause or backtracking _ to
continue the dialogue in a spirit of realism, openness and good
will.''
   Late Wednesday, a senior Communist Party official said Gorbachev
would cut short his trip to the United States and cancel his planned
excursions to Cuba and London to return home because of a
devastating earthquake that struck the Soviet Caucasus region while
the Soviet leader was in New York. A scientist in the capital of the
republic of Armenia estimated the death toll would run into
thousands.
   In his first address to the 159-nation General Assembly,
Gorbachev also suggested the United Nations deploy a peacekeeping
force to Afghanistan to oversee the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers
and the transition to a broad-based government. He called for a Jan.
1 cease-fire in the country.
   Gorbachev covered a range of topics and extolled peaceful
co-existence in the world in his hour-long address. He urged an end
to Cold War animosities.
   After his speech, Gorbachev ate lunch with President Reagan and
Bush on nearby Governor's Island. Standing along a fence facing the
Statue of Liberty, Gorbachev said the men had a ``good
conversation.''
   Later, he and his wife, Raisa, visited the World Trade Center
where he thanked New Yorkers for ``this warm hospitality.'' Dressed
in a grey overcoat, Gorbachev said he hoped the superpowers would
``get rid as soon as we can of all suspicions and the legacies of
the past.''
   Asked if he pressed Reagan for anything in return for his pledge
to trim the Soviet military by 500,000 troops, Gorbachev said: ``In
developing our relations we can work only together so we do hope
that the United States and the Europeans will work with us and will
take certain steps.''
   But the luncheon session was ``not a negotiating meeting,''
Gorbachev said, adding he was happy to join Reagan and Bush in
``this get-together.''
   It was the fifth meeting between Reagan and Gorbachev, who was in
Washington a year ago to sign a treaty reducing intermediate and
medium-range missiles.
   ``We are at the birth of a new model of ensuring security _ not
through the buildup of arms ... but to the contrary , through their
reduction on the basis of compromise,'' Gorbachev said.
   Besides detailing troop reduction, Gorbachev outlined a number of
proposals on a broad array of topics in his U.N. speech.
   He said, for instance, the Soviet Union is ready to impose a
moratorium of up to century on debt servicing by poor countries and,
in some cases, write off the debts.
   He suggested an international space station monitor the
environment, and discussed having the International Court of Justice
in The Hague arbitrate human rights cases.
   At home, he said, ``Soviet democracy will be place on a solid
normative basis,'' with ``glasnost,'' or openness, and freedom of
conscience, enshrined in law.
   Members of the General Assembly greeted Gorbachev with sustained
applause at the end of his 26-page speech, but they did not give him
a standing ovation.
   General Assembly President Dante Caputo, the foreign minister of
Argentina, praised Gorbachev's address as a ``very important speech,
with specific proposals on disarmament, regional conflicts,
development and ecology.'' He said it contained ``a new
philosophical approach in Soviet foreign policy.''
   Gorbachev emphasized disarmament, which he called ``the main
issue,'' and provided details of his unilateral initiatives to
reduce the Red Army's strength.
   ``Today I can report to you that the Soviet Union has taken a
decision to reduce its armed forces,'' he said.
   ``Within the next two years their numerical strength will be
reduced by 500,000 men. The numbers of conventional armaments will
also be lsubstantially reduced. This will be done unilaterally,
without relation to (talks on conventional disarmament) in Vienna,''
he said.
   By agreement with the Warsaw Pact allies, the Soviet Union will
withdraw and disband six tank divisions from East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary by 1991.
   Altogether, he said, Soviet forces stationed in those three
countries, will be reduced by 50,000 men. Some 5,000 tanks will also
be slashed, he said.
   The Soviet Union will also reorganize Soviet divisions in Eastern
Europe so they are ``clearly defensive.''
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union plans to cut soldiers and
armaments in European part of his country and in its Asian
territory. In Mongolia, for instance, ``a major portion of Soviet
troops temporarily stationed there will return home,'' he said.
   But Gorbachev warned, ``We shall maintain our country's defense
capability at a level of reasonable and reliable sufficiency, so
that no one might be tempted to encroach on the security of the
U.S.S.R. and our allies.''
   Turning to relations with the United States, he said no one
underestimates the ``seriousness of our differences and the
toughness of outstanding problems.''
   But he said, ``We have graduated from the primary school of
learning to understand each other and seek solutions in our own and
common interests.''
   The Soviet Union wants to work with the Bush administration for
``consistent movement toward a treaty on 50 percent reduction in
strategic offensive arms, while preserving the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty,'' he said.

   The best news for fans of animated movies came
with last week's box-office report which showed big grosses for
``The Land Before Time'' and ``Oliver and Company.''
   Revival of animation, the most tedious and expensive kind of
filmmaking, has been predicted every few years. Until recently,
though, economics made animation features risky. But in their first
weekend ``The Land Before Time'' topped all releases with $7.5
million in 1,395 theaters ($5,395 average), and ``Oliver and
Company'' in a smaller release of 952 theaters scored no. 4 with $4
million ($4,226 average).
   Those are big numbers, and they're likely to grow through the
holiday season. That's encouraging for the animation trade, which
has been hampered not only by the heavy expense of production but
the nature of the audience.
   ``A large number of tickets we sell go for a lower admission
price,'' said Don Bluth, who produced ``The Land before Time.''
   ``If we make a boffo with a picture, it's because we sold more
tickets.'' Bluth, who formerly worked for the Disney Co., cautiously
predicts a renaissance of animation.
   Walt Disney Pictures, which produced ``Oliver and Company,'' has
pumped up its animation department and is starting up an additional
facility at the Disney-MGM studio tour in Florida. Roy E. Disney,
nephew of Walt, is largely responsible for the revival. Four years
ago when Roy helped create a new management at Disney, the outlook
was dismal.
   ``Animation was dying around here,'' he said in an interview at
his studio office. ``There had been 10 years of a kind of lack of
faith in it, and a lack of direction to it. There were an awful lot
of discouraged artists working here.
   ``We were finishing up `The Black Cauldron,' which had been an
enormous seven-year effort, with the kind of strange idea of doing
an epic or making a masterpiece and not having any strong sense of
what the story was. There were a lot of people who thought we just
weren't going forward with the animation department. There was even
talk of getting out of the movie business entirely.''
   Disney was faced with the task of educating new company heads,
who were trained in live-action films, to the uniqueness of the
animation process.
   ``First of all, it's a matter of time; `Oliver,' for eample, took
four years to complete,'' he said. His campaign was aided by having
``The Great Mouse Detective'' in good story form. When the movie
proved a hit, all doubts were erased.
   ``Oliver and Company'' resulted from a ``Gong Show'' session in
which 20 film executives appeared with at least three story ideas.
Most were shot down, but an updated ``Oliver Twist'' survived.
Members of Fagin's gang became dogs, as was the newcomer, Oliver.
But during story development Oliver became a kitten.
   The young animators worked at a fast clip, inspired by the
casting of the voices, including Bette Midler, Billy Joel, Dom
DeLuise and Robert Loggia. Many of the new artists have come from
the Disney-endowed California Institute of the Arts, but Disney
observed that more schools are teaching animation as an art.
   The studio won't reveal the cost of ``Oliver and Company,'' but
Disney said it was in the middle range for an animated feature
(estimate: $18 million). Computers will increasingly relieve some of
the tedium of inking and painting, he said, helping to bring down
expenses.
   ``But the animation of a character, hand-drawn in pencil I think
will never change,'' he said.
   Bluth, who produced ``The Land Before Time'' for $12 million,
found a way to reduce animation expense: He moved his entire studio
to Ireland because of the labor cost of animation. The Irish
government offered a 10-year commitment for tax breaks, grants for
Irish artists who would be trained and access to bank loans, he said.
   ``It was like Moses leading the children of Israel out of
Egypt,'' said Bluth. ``The artists had to pull up all their stakes;
many of them sold their homes.
   ``Many of them have bought homes there, they all have Irish
accents, some have joined the Catholic church. It's a conversion to
another way of life. I don't think many plan to stay there forever.
But they have embraced the Irish society.''
   Bluth led an earlier exodus of Disney animators during the
studio's low period and produced ``The Secret of NIMH,'' a failure.
Then he combined with Steven Spielberg on ``An American Tail,'' a
rousing success. ``The Land Before Time'' also resulted from a
Spielberg idea.
   ```I can't understand why no one has made a film about
dinosaurs,''' Bluth recalled Spielberg telling him. ```It's a
natural. There is a great interest in dinosaurs. George Lucas and
myself have wanted to do such a movie for some times, but we didn't
want to do it with puppets; we tried that and it didn't work.'''
   With Spielberg and Lucas as executive producers, Bluth could
hardly miss. He admitted his ignorance of dinosaurs, but he said
Spielberg told him: ```You can learn.'''
   Bluth and his artists soon recognized the difficulty of animating
dinosaurs: ``For instance, the brontosaurus with the long neck. It
has a little head, like a ball on a stick. It doesn't have the
shoulders and the hands to give you gestures. It all has to be done
with facial expressions.''
   But how to make the beasts move? Bluth and company reasoned that
the prehistoric creatures were reptiles, and birds evolved from
reptilian forms. So the artists copied moves from films of chickens
and turkeys.
   After the opening of ``The Land Before Time,'' Bluth returned to
the Dublin studio where production is under way on the next feature,
``All Dogs Go to Heaven,'' which takes place in the hereafter.

   It's suspected that defendants may fib during
trial, that lawyers also may shade the truth, but it's the witness
who arrives late that has the most colorful story, said the state
Supreme Court's top jurist.
   Chief Justice Robert N.C. Nix Jr. described some of his favorites
in an article published Wednesday in the Philadelphia Daily News.
   A Delaware man who showed up two hours late for trial told Nix,
``I asked two people how to get to the courthouse, and they both
said they didn't think one had been built yet.''
   Another late witness admitted he ``was hooked on the lottery, and
I got stuck in a long line waiting for my ticket this morning.''
   And, just as a bench warrant had been issued for a missing
witness, the glassy-eyed man staggered into the courtroom.
   ``Don't get so uptight,'' the man said. ``After a few belts in
the morning, I'd testify against anybody.''
   One woman tried a hard-luck story. She said she pulled her car
into an empty space but the meter was broken.
   ``So I decided to write a note and put it next to the slot,'' she
said. ``But, when I didn't have a pen or paper I had to go to the
store.''
   ``When I got back, there was a ticket,'' she said. ``That's why
I'm late.''

   It won't make the show-and-tell circuit but
5-year-old Jared Reeher will have some stories to tell his
classmates after helping his mother give birth to his brother.
   ``He asked several times if I was OK, and I said I was, but it
was time,'' said his mother, 26-year-old Michelle Reeher. ``He
helped me into the bedroom and got pillows for me and towels to wrap
the baby.''
   After she went into labor early Sunday, her husband, Kevin, 27,
woke up and ran next door to to the home of William and Cindy
Swingle to call for an ambulance because his house doesn't have a
telephone.
   He returned home, but went back to call again when his wife's
contractions suddenly became more intense.
   When Mrs. Swingle arrived at the Reeher home, she saw the baby
lying on Mrs. Reeher's abdomen.
   ``All Jared said was `Mommy, it's out,''' Mrs. Swingle said.
   Reeher arrived a few minutes later, followed by his parents and a
paramedic who had just arrived. The paramedic cut the umbilical cord
and prepared the mother and baby for an ambulance ride to the
hospital.
   Jared, a kindergarten student at Mercer Elementary School, ``had
some big stories to tell his classmates,'' Mrs. Reeher said.
   Mrs. Reeher and the 7-pound, 14-ounce baby were released Tuesday
from Greenville Regional Hospital. She and her husband have not yet
named the boy.

   Parents who want to make an investment
in their children's future can buy a few dozen credit hours at
Indiana University _ if they're quick.
   The university is selling _ at today's tuition rates _ 450,000
credit hours that can be redeemed between 1990 and 2010. Similar
programs are being tried in other states.
   The Guaranteed Tuition Certificates, worth about $30 million, go
on sale Monday at 400 bank offices across the state, and one banker
predicts the credit hours will be sold out within three months.
   ``We think it's going to be very popular,'' said Ward Roth,
executive vice president of Bank One in Indianapolis. The bank
received 225 calls about the plan Monday, the day before university
officials formally announced the offer.
   Indiana University President Thomas Ehrlich said the certificates
will not guarantee admission.
   ``What it does guarantee is the ability to finance the tuition
cost, assuming one is admitted five, 10, 15 or 20 years from now,''
Ehrlich said.
   Tuition on the Bloomington campus now costs about $2,000 a year.
   For the student who decides not to attend one of the eight
campuses that the credit certificates will be good at, the bank will
help sell the unused certificates.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Previous euphemisms for lying are now, to use one
outdated word, inoperative. In the latest British lingo, to withhold
the truth is to be ``economical.''
   ``Economical'' has been enshrined in the Longman Register of New
Words, among 1,200 words and phrases including ``plonker,''
``loadsamoney,'' ``bonk journalism'' and ``yah.''
   All, according to Longman's editor, John Ayto, have insinuated
themselves into the language of Chaucer, Shakespeare and Dickens
since 1986.
   ``Economical'' owes its new meaning to court cases involving
``Spycatcher,'' the expose by former intelligence official Peter
Wright that the government attempted to suppress.
   In a court case in Australia over ``Spycatcher,'' former British
civil service head Sir Robert Armstrong admitted he had previously
been ``economical wth the truth.''
   ``Economical'' thus has come to be euphemism for ``deliberately
withholding something from public knowledge,'' the Register said.
   ``Sexy'' has been tamed, now meaning attractive, enjoyable or
trendy, the Register said, but the language has found new ways to
talk about the birds and the bees.
   The press' infatuation with sex has produced the term ``bonk
journalism,'' defined in the Register as ``journalism concerned with
obtaining and printing accounts of the supposed sexual activities of
well-known people.''
   ``Plonker,'' the insult which Del Boy constantly hurls at his
younger brother in the British Broadcasting Corp. TV sitcom ``Only
Fools and Horses,'' has established itself as a synonym for a
dim-witted and ineffectual person.
   The Register regretfully chronicled a growing tendency, blamed on
the former 13 colonies, to use nouns as verbs: ``to nuke,'' a usage
which was denounced as an ``alarmingly cozy'' euphemism for starting
World War III; ``to stiff,'' or fail in a commercial venture, and
``to gender,'' or stereotypically associate something with men or
women.
   Several new words and phrases _ the derogatory ``dependency
culture'' and ``learned helplessness'' along with the approving
``can do'' _ are owed to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   She also is credited with reviving a term from her native
Lincolnshire: ``frit,'' meaning someone who is frightened.
   One of her wealthy supporters in the financial world is now said
to be ``well-wedged,'' a real ``loadsamoney.''
   ``Loadsamoney (noun), British informal: extensive and conspicuous
wealth,'' the Register defines. The word comes from a comedian,
Harry ``Loadsamoney'' Enfield, who portrays a grotesque, cash-waving
character, and launched the term on its way from cabaret through the
House of Commons and into the vernacular.
   In the wallet of a loadsamoney one might find an ``Archer,'' or
2,000 pounds ($3,700), a sum that figured prominently in a 1987
libel suit won by novelist and former Conservative Party chairman
Jeffrey Archer against a newspaper.
   A loadsamoney plonker who is soon parted from his Archers is to
be pitied as a ``lombard'' _ ``loads of money but a real dunce,'' or
words to that effect.
   Yuppie tendencies in the political opposition are now disparaged
as ``Ramada socialism,'' a term credited to Labor Party lawmaker
Dennis Skinner to describe in luxury-hotel terms the
``bourgeoisification of the Labor Party.''
   To which the yuppie might concur, ``Yah,'' which the Register
describes as ``the nasal bray of the Sloane.'' That refers to the
fashionable west London turf around Sloane Square, where smart young
things became known years ago as ``Sloane Rangers.''
   The Longman Register of New Words will be published Jan. 9.

   Space shuttle Atlantis suffered
heavier than normal damage to its thermal tiles during liftoff on
its just-completed flight and about 150 tiles will have to be
replaced, a space agency official said Wednesday.
   ``The damage comparatively is significant, but it's not a major
concern,'' said Conrad Nagel, Atlantis' processing director. ``We
have to understand why we had this damage and keep it from happening
again.''
   He said the damage would be easy to repair and would not affect
Atlantis' next flight, scheduled for liftoff on April 28. Overall,
he said, the shuttle returned from its secret military mission in a
``very clean'' condition.
   A NASA spokesman dismissed as ``a hoax'' a South Dakota
television report that quoted a man as saying shuttle conversations
from the top-secret military mission came over his phone line during
a call to California.
   Roy Nyberg, who owns a hardware store in Sioux Falls, told
station KELO he heard ground controllers telling astronauts ``Keep
your cool'' amid a problem controlling the cabin temperature. He
also said he heard some vacuum had been lost.
   In response, Nagel said late Wednesday that there was a minor
malfunction in the shuttle's air conditioning system. The problem
caused about a gallon of water to leak into the cabin, and the
astronauts recaptured it with a vacuum cleaner, Nagel said.
   David Garrett, chief of news and information at NASA's
Washington, D.C., headquarters, nevertheless doubted Nyberg's story.
   ``There's no way. You couldn't hear it. You've got a hoax on your
hand,'' Garrett said. ``All the communication was encripted. There's
no way he could have heard it. There was no way that I know of that
anybody could've heard any air-to-ground voice communications.''
   Nagel reported the tile bruising apparently occurred during the
launch phase, probably by impact with something loose, and that in
flight the five astronauts inspected and assessed it, using a
television camera on the end of the ship's 50-foot robot arm.
   The shuttle is covered with about 28,000 tiles made of various
materials designed to protect the orbiter from atmospheric re-entry
heat. He said the tile damage posed no threat to the shuttle's
return to Earth.
   Nagel said the heaviest damage was concentrated in a strip
3-to-4-feet long ``down the right hand side, along the line of the
fuselage.''
   He said one tile in the nose was missing and ``it looked like it
was popped off by the impact of something.''
   There was speculation here that a part from the solid fuel
booster rockets, the external tank or the orbiter might have fallen
off and hit the craft. Nagel said he did not want to speculate.
   He said a small fiberglass panel was missing from one of
Atlantis' maneuvering engines, but NASA said this probably did not
cause the problem.
   Nagel made his comments in an interview from Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., where he leads a team that is inspecting Atlantis and
preparing it for return to the Kennedy Space Center here atop a
Boeing 747 airliner.
   He said Atlantis' tile damage was about twice that suffered by
Discovery, which made the first post-Challenger shuttle flight two
months ago.
   ``It appears that between 125 and 175 tiles will have to be
scrapped and replaced,'' Nagel said. In addition, he said, scores of
tiles with scratches and ``dings'' will have to be repaired in place.
   ``Dinged'' tiles are common on a shuttle, with much of the damage
being caused by objects kicked up from the runway when the vehicle
lands.
   He reported brakes and about 200 other systems modified since the
Challenger explosion 34 months ago worked well. He said that during
the four-day flight there were only a few technical problems, most
involving system monitoring instruments.
   He said Atlantis and the Boeing 747 would leave Edwards on Sunday
and stop overnight at Kelly Air Force Base near San Antonio before
arriving at the Kennedy Space Center on Monday.

<HEAD>Ecuador Now Crossroads For World Cocaine Trade</HEAD>

   This muggy port city has become the
base of operations for Colombian drug gangs that are turning tiny
Ecuador, a nation of just 10 million people, into a crossroads for
the world cocaine trade.
   In the last two years the amount of Colombian cocaine flowing
through the Andean nation en route to the United States and Europe
has increased dramatically, according to Ecuadorean narcotics police
and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
   Officials also fear Colombia's drug barons are seeking to use
Ecuador to launder their huge cocaine profits and to invest in
legitimate enterprises.
   ``The enormous profits from drug trafficking have converted it
into an octopus whose tentacles are threatening to strangle
Ecuador,'' President Leon Febres Cordero said in May, three months
before his term ended.
   John Powell, head of DEA operations in Ecuador, estimated that 30
to 50 tons of cocaine will have been smuggled into and out of
Ecuador by the end of this year.
   ``Just in the first six months of this year, there's been over 5
tons of cocaine seized in other countries that we know came through
Ecuador,'' Powell said in an interview.
   The significance of the figures can be seen in U.S. estimates
that 72 tons of cocaine are consumed annually in the United States.
   Colombia's drug lords have diverted much of their cocaine through
Ecuador after narcotics officials in the United States and Europe
began searching Colombian planes and ships more thoroughly, say
police and U.S. drug officers.
   Ecuador is wedged between Peru and Colombia on the northwest
shoulder of South America. Peru is the world's largest grower of
coca leaf, the raw material of cocaine; Colombia is home to the drug
cartels that control the world's cocaine trade.
   ``If you put pressure on in one place, the traffickers have to go
somewhere else, and Ecuador is handy,'' Powell said. ``They've been
using it for a while anyway to get coca paste from Peru to Colombia
for processing.''
   The seizures of pure cocaine smuggled in containers aboard
freighters from Guayaquil this year include:
   _ 5,129 pounds discovered in a chocolate shipment at Newark,
N.J., in June. It was the largest cocaine seizure ever made by U.S.
authorities outside Florida.
   _ 2,860 pounds discovered by U.S. federal agents in April in Port
Everglades, Fla. It was buried in a shipment of frozen fruit pulp to
prevent detection by dogs trained to sniff out drugs.
   _ 759 pounds found hidden between the wood paneling of
prefabricated walls shipped in March to Barcelona, Spain. It was one
of the largest seizures of cocaine ever made in Europe.
   Since 1986 U.S. customs officials also have seized five
Ecuatoriana cargo and passenger planes that have landed in Miami and
New York with cocaine hidden aboard. The state-owned airline has had
to pay more than $4 million in fines to gain the release of the
planes.
   ``Ecuador is beginning to feel the breath of the Colombian
mafia,'' said Col. Gustavo Gallegos, head of Interpol in Ecuador.
   The menace of the mafia also is seen in the attempt to convert
Ecuador into a major money-laundering country.
   ``Because of its bank secrecy laws, this is an ideal place to
launder drug profits,'' Powell said.
   Ecuadorean bankers estimate that $200 million to $400 million in
cocaine money will have entered Ecuador by the end of this year,
either for laundering or for investment in legitimate businesses.
   ``That's a lot of money coming into a small country like Ecuador.
It can have a corrupting influence,'' Powell said.
   Newspapers have complained in recent editorials about Colombian
drug money corrupting judges and driving up the price of real estate.
   Tracking down the source of the money is complicated by the fact
that investments by apparently legitimate Colombian companies have
also increased sharply in the last few years.
   Ecuador's largest brewery is among the most recent and prominent
of the Colombian purchases.
   Some 120,000 Colombian tourists are expected to visit Ecuador
this year, making it hard for Ecuador's narcotics police to keep
track of suspicious visitors.
   ``Colombian traffickers enter here easily with false identities.
They buy property, open businesses,'' Interpol's Gallegos said in an
interview in Quito, the highland capital. ``Once they are set up,
with everything in legal order, they begin to export cocaine.''
   Authorities are investigating some 20 Guayaquil export companies
bought by Colombians in the past year, including the firm that
shipped cocaine in containers of chocalate to the United States.
   Febres Cordero, the former president, is credited by U.S.
narcotics officials with destroying nearly all the coca plantations
that Colombian cocaine traffickers tried to set up several years ago
in remote jungle regions bordering Colombia.
   Powell said U.S. officials are confident Ecuador's new president,
Rodrigo Borja, and his police officials will try to ``outperform''
the Febres Cordero government in the drug war.
   ``They see narcotics as a threat to the stability of the
government,'' he said. ``It doesn't take any genius to look next
door to Peru or Colombia to see the disastrous effects the cocaine
trade has had on those countries.''

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador
has left a military hospital where he spent six days after falling
ill during inauguration ceremonies for Mexico's president.
   Duarte, who suffers from incurable liver cancer, was released
Wednesday.
   He was hospitalized with stomach pains shortly after Carlos
Salinas de Gortari was inaugurated last week, and doctors said he
was suffering from an intestinal infection.
   ``He's in high spirits, he feels good, and we'll be going to El
Salvador soon,'' said Duarte's doctor, Jose Luis Saca. ``He's
reacted well to a bland diet.''
   He said Duarte might be able to return home today.
   In June, doctors diagnosed Duarte with cancer and gave him from
six to 18 months to live. However, they have said recently that his
condition has improved remarkably.
   At a brief news conference before leaving the hospital, Duarte
said it would be hard to set up a Christmas truce with the rebel
Farabundo Marti Liberation Front.
   ``The problem is that the terrorists have a concept of violent
war, of reaching objectives via terrorism. That I can't agree
with,'' Duarte said.
   In 1984, Duarte became his country's first democratically elected
president in 50 years.
   Since then, his U.S.-backed government has fought leftist rebels
in an eight-year struggle. More than 65,000 Salvadorans, mostly
civilians, have been killed.

   Election officials have certified
the mayoral victory of Hector Luis Acevedo, whose 29-vote triumph
ends the pro-statehood New Progressive Party's 20-year lock on City
Hall.
   The final figures announced Wednesday gave 100,525 votes to
Acevedo of the Popular Democratic Party and 100,496 for Jose
Granados of the New Progressives.
   The State Elections Commission had been recounting votes for this
city of 1 million since the Nov. 8 general election.
   In that voting, Puerto Rico Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon of the
Popular Democrats was re-elected for a third term. Outgoing San Juan
Mayor Baltasar Corrada del Rio lost to Colon.
   City Hall has been controlled since 1968 by the New Progressive
Party, which advocates statehood for the U.S. commonwealth. The
Popular Democrats say they seek more autonomy in issues like trade
and immigration, but do not challenge the fundamental relationship
with the United States.

   The stork has left a special-delivery bundle
at the home of actor John Ratzenberger, who plays letter carrier
Cliff Clavin on NBC's ``Cheers,'' and his wife, Georgia.
   Nina Katherine Ratzenberger was born Dec. 1 at Valley
Presbyterian Hospital, weighing 7 pounds and 6 ounces.
   It was the second child for the Ratzenbergers, who have an
18-month-old son, James John.
   Ratzenberger's character on ``Cheers'' is a regular at the Boston
bar depicted in the show and a know-it-all loudmouth who sees
delivering the mail as only slightly less important than signing the

   Actor Gene Kelly, the dancing star of
``Anchors Aweigh,'' ``Singin' in the Rain,'' and ``An American in
Paris,'' will be honored with the 25th annual Screen Actors Guild
Award, the union says.
   Kelly, 76, will be given the award Sunday at the guild's annual
membership meeting in Universal City ``for fostering the finest
ideals of the acting profession,'' the organization announced
Wednesday.
   The award is the only one presented by the guild.
   Kelly's 40 films have included the classic musicals ``Anchors
Aweigh,'' for which he received an Academy Award nomination for best
actor; ``Singin' in the Rain''; ``An American in Paris'';
``Brigadoon,'' and ``That's Entertainment.''
   He was given a special Academy Award in 1951 ``in appreciation of
his versatility as an actor, singer, director and dancer, and
specially for his brilliant achievements in the art of choreography
on film.''

   Daredevil Evel Knievel's son, Robbie, says
he plans to try to accomplish the feat that put his father in a coma
_ jump a motorcycle 160 feet over the fountains at Caesars Palace in
Las Vegas.
   ``This has been a dream of mine since I was a kid and would sit
and watch the film of my father's jump,'' Robbie Knievel, 26, said
at a news conference announcing his jump April 14.
   Evel Knievel fell off his motorcycle as it hit the ramp when he
attempted the jump more than 20 years ago, and was in a coma for
most of the next month.
   The son's try will be produced by Showtime Event Television and
distributed to cable operators on a pay-for-view basis.
   ``He'll get across it safely,'' Evel Knievel, 50, said Wednesday.
``If they (the bookmakers) make a line on whether he makes it or
not, bet on him.''
   Robbie Knievel, who began performing motorcycle stunts with his
father, already has topped his dad's feat of jumping 21 cars. The
younger Knievel soared over a 22-car lineup July 30 in Portland,
Ore., holding his hands over his head.
   His father retired from motorcycle riding exhibitions in 1980,
and takes an active hand in his son's career.

   Salvador Dali continues to improve and
may be able to come home from the hospital in a few days, say
doctors treating the surrealist painter for a serious heart
condition.
   Dali, 84, has been in the Quiron Clincic since Nov. 28, when he
was taken there from a hospital in his hometown of Figueras
suffering from severe heart trouble aggravated by blood clots in his
left lung. He had been admitted to the hospital the day before with
pneumonia.
   He was transferred Monday from the clinic's intensive care unit
to a regular room and was visited by King Juan Carlos, who said Dali
told him he hoped to improve enough to resume painting.
   The artist ``continues to improve, and if no complications arise,
it is expected that in a few days he may move to his residence at
Galatea Tower,'' the five doctors attending Dali said in a statement
Wednesday.
   Dali has been in poor health since 1984, and received a pacemaker
in 1986.
   He is one of the founders of the surrealist movement and the last
living member of an outstanding generation of Spanish painters that
included Pablo Picasso, who died in 1973, and Joan Miro, who died a
decade later.

   New York tycoon Donald Trump's
282-foot yacht is too much for Palm Beach or Fort Lauderdale's
upscale Pier 66 hotel and marina _ but just right for the Best
Western.
   The Trump Princess was arriving today, but it's too big to tie up
behind Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach mansion, or navigate the channel
to Pier 66.
   It turns out that the only private marina in the area large
enough for the big boat is the Best Western Marina Inn and Yacht
Harbor.
   ``We've never had anything like this at the Best Western,'' said
general manager Shirley Kilpatrick.
   She said she doesn't expect Trump himself to stay in the hotel,
but if he does, ``we'll certainly quote him a corporate rate.''
   The hotel owner was not too happy about the yacht's arrival,
saying she was worried the Princess might crash through the Sea Wall.
   That, however, raised the troubling prospect of how to say ``no''
to Trump.
   ``What really had me worried was that if I told them they
couldn't stay, they would just say, `How much do you want for the
place?''' Ms. Kilpatrick said.

   A project that's supposed to be the West
Coast's rival to the Statue of Liberty is drawing bad reviews from
some, who say the proposed avant-garde monument resembles earthquake
rubble and would be an eye sore.
   The winning design for the privately funded project that will
cost up to $45 million was unveiled this week by a blue-ribbon
committee appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley.
   The winning entry, called ``clouds of steel,'' follows the
deconstructivism movement of modern architecture in which buildings
seem to lack symmetry.
   It was designed by New York architects Hani Rashid and Lise Anne
Couture, whose mission was to create a structure to celebrate Los
Angeles' ethnic diversity.
   ``It looks like a freeway that just blew up, or after an
earthquake,'' said City Councilwoman Gloria Molina of the monument
that would straddle the Hollywood Freeway. ``This is too strange for
Los Angeles to ever appreciate it or grow to like.''
   Councilman Ernani Bernardi is concerned motorists will pay more
attention to the monument, a conglomeration of twisted steel, than
to driving. ``I think it will be a terrible hazard,'' he said.
   ``We have to be open to possibilities,'' argued former Gov.
Edmund G. Brown Jr. ``People are always laughing at innovation. Art
is what isn't. It is creation.''
   Michael Rotondi, director of the Southern California Institute of
Architecture and one of 13 members of the international selection
committee, conceded many on the panel had never been to Los Angeles.
   But, he said, they are ``some of the most forward thinkers in
architecture. Even if they haven't been to Los Angeles, they know
the work of Los Angeles.''

<TEXT>
   Here is the English-language text of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's speech to the United Nations, as
provided by the Soviet Mission:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Esteemed Mr. President, esteemed Mr. Secretary General,
distinguished delegates,
   We have come here to show our respect for the United Nations,
which increasingly has been manifesting its ability to act as a
unique international center in the service of peace and security.
   We have come here to show our respect for the dignity of this
organization, capable of accumulating the collective wisdom and will
of mankind.
   Recent events have been making it increasingly clear that the
world needs such an organization, and that the organization itself
needs active involvement of all of its members, their support for
its initiatives and actions and their potentialities and original
contributions that enrich its activity.
   A little more than a year ago, in an article entitled ``Realities
and the Guarantees of a Secure World,'' I set out some ideas on
problems of concern to the United Nations.
   The time since then has given fresh food for thought. World
developments have indeed come to a crucial point.
   The role played by the Soviet Union in world affairs is
well-known and in view of the revolutionary perestroika under way in
our country, which contains a tremendous potential for peace and
international cooperation, we are now particularly interested in
being properly understood.
   That is why we have come here to address this most authoritative
world body and to share our thoughts with it. We want it to be the
first to learn of our new important decisions.
   What will mankind be like when it enters the twenty-first
century? People are already fascinated by this not too distant
future. We are looking ahead to it with hopes for the best and yet
with a feeling of concern.
   The world in which we live today is radically different from what
it was at the beginning or even in the middle of this century. And
it continues to change as do all its components.
   The advent of nuclear weapons was just another tragic reminder of
the fundamental nature of that change. A material symbol and
expression of absolute military power, nuclear weapons at the same
time revealed the absolute limits of that power.
   The problem of mankind's survival and self-preservation came to
the fore.
   We are witnessing most profound social change.
   Whether in the East or the South, the West or the North, hundreds
of millions of people, new nations and States, new public movements
and ideologies have moved to the forefront of history.
   Broad-based and frequently turbulent popular movements have given
expression, in a multidimensional and contradictory way, to a
longing for independence, democracy and social justice. The idea of
democratizing the entire world order has become a powerful
socio-political force.
   At the same time, the scientific and technological revolution has
turned many economic, food, energy, environmental, information and
population problems, which only recently we treated as national or
regional ones, into global problems.
   Thanks to the advances in mass media and means of transportation,
the world seems to have become more visible and tangible.
International communication has become easier than ever before.
   Today, the preservation of any kind of ``closed'' society is
hardly possible. This calls for a radical review of approaches to
the totality of the problems of international cooperation as a major
element of universal security.
   The world economy is becoming a single organism, and no state,
whatever its social system or economic status, can normally develop
outside it. This places on the agenda the need to devise a
fundamentally new machinery for the functioning of the world
economy, a new structure of the international division of labor.
   At the same time, the growth of the world economy reveals the
contradictions and limits inherent in traditional-type
industrialization. Its further extension and intensification spell
environmental catastrophe.
   But there are still many countries without sufficiently developed
industries, and some have not yet moved beyond the pre-industrial
stage. One of the major problems is whether the process of their
economic growth will follow the old technological patterns or they
can join in the search for environmentally clean production.
   And there is another problem: instead of diminishing, the gap
between the developed and most of the developing countries is
increasingly growing into a serious global threat.
   Hence the need to begin a search for a fundamentally new type of
industrial progress _ one that would meet the interests of all
peoples and states.
   In a word, the new realities are changing the entire world
situation. The differences and contradictions inherited from the
past are diminishing or being displaced. But new ones are emerging.
   Some of the past differences and disputes are losing their
importance. But conflicts of a different kind are taking their place.
   Life is making us abandon established stereotypes and outdated
views. It is making us discard illusions.
   The very concept of the nature and criteria of progress is
changing.
   It would be naive to think that the problems plaguing mankind
today can be solved with the means and methods which were applied or
seemed to work in the past.
   Indeed, mankind has accumulated a wealth of experience in the
process of political, economic and social development under highly
diverse conditions. But that experience belongs to the practices and
to the world that have become or are becoming part of the past.
   This is one of the signs of the crucial nature of the current
phase in history.
   The greatest philosophers sought to grasp the laws of social
development and find an answer to the main question: How to make
man's life happy, just and safe. Two great revolutions, the French
revolution of 1789 and the Russian revolution of 1917, exerted a
powerful impact on the very nature of history and radically changed
the course of world developments.
   Both of them, each in its own way, gave a tremendous impetus to
mankind's progress. To a large extent, those two revolutions shaped
the way of thinking that is still prevalent in social consciousness.
It is a most precious spiritual heritage.
   But today we face a different world, for which we must seek a
different road to the future. In seeking it, we must, of course,
draw on the accumulated experience and yet be aware of the
fundamental differences between the situation yesterday and what we
are facing today.
   But the novelty of the tasks before us, as well as their
difficulty, goes beyond that. Today, we have entered an era when
progress will be shaped by universal human interests.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: human interests.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The awareness of this dictates that world politics, too, should
be guided by the primacy of universal human values.
   The history of past centuries and millennia was a history of wars
that raged almost everywhere, of frequent desperate battles to the
point of mutual annihilation.
   They grew out of clashes of social and political interests,
national enmity, ideological or religious incompatibility. All this
did happen.
   And even today many would want these vestiges of the past to be
accepted as immutable law.
   But concurrently with wars, animosities and divisions among
peoples and countries, another trend, with equally objective causes,
was gaining momentum _ the process of the emergence of a mutually
interrelated and integral world.
   Today, further world progress is only possible through a search
for universal human consensus as we move forward to a new world
order.
   We have come to a point when the disorderly play of elemental
forces leads into an impasse. The international community must learn
how it can shape and guide developments in such a way as to preserve
our civilization, to make it safe for all and more conducive to
normal life.
   We are speaking of cooperation which could be more accurately
termed co-creation and co-development.
   The formula of development ``at the expense of others'' is on the
way out. In the light of existing realities, no genuine progress is
possible at the expense of the rights and freedoms of individuals
and nations, or at the expense of nature.
   Efforts to solve global problems require a new scope and quality
of interaction of states and socio-political currents, regardless of
ideological or other differences.
   Of course, radical changes and revolutionary transformations will
continue to occur within individual countries and social structures.
This is how it was and how it will be.
   But here, too, our time marks a change. Internal transformations
no longer can advance their national goals if they develop just
along ``parallel courses'' with others, without making use of the
achievements of the outside world and of the potential inherent in
equitable cooperation.
   In these circumstances, any interference in those internal
developments, designed to redirect them to someone's liking, would
have all the more destructive consequences for establishing a
peaceful order.
   In the past, differences were often a factor causing mutual
rejection. Now they have a chance of becoming a factor for mutual
enrichment and mutual attraction.
   Behind differences in social systems, in the way of life and in
preferences for certain values stand differing interests. There is
no escaping that fact.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: that fact.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   But equally, there is no escaping the need to find a balance of
interests within an international framework, which has become a
condition for survival and progress.
   Pondering all this, one comes to the conclusion that if we are to
take into account the lessons of the past and the realities of the
present, if we are to reckon with the objective logic of world
development, we must look for ways to improve the international
situation and build a new world _ and we must do it together.
   And, if so, we ought to agree on the basic, truly universal
prerequisites and principles of such action.
   It is obvious, for instance, that the use or threat of force no
longer can or must be an instrument of foreign policy. This applies
above all to nuclear arms, but that is not the only thing that
matters. All of us, and primarily the stronger of us, must exercise
self-restraint and totally rule out any outward-oriented use of
force.
   That is the first and the most important component of a
non-violent world as an ideal which we proclaimed together with
India in the Delhi Declaration and which we invite you to follow.
   After all, it is now quite clear that building up military power
makes no country omnipotent. What is more, one-sided reliance on
military power ultimately weakens other components of national
security.
   It is also quite clear to us that the principle of freedom of
choice is mandatory. Its non-recognition is fraught with extremely
grave consequences for world peace.
   Denying that right to the peoples under whatever pretext or
rhetorical guise means jeopardizing even the fragile balance that
has been attained. Freedom of choice is a universal principle that
should allow for no exceptions.
   It was not simply out of good intentions that we came to the
conclusion that this principle is absolute. We were driven to it by
an unbiased analysis of the objective trends of today.
   More and more characteristic of them is the increasingly
multioptional nature of social development in different countries.
This applies both to the capitalist and to the socialist system. The
diversity of the socio-political structures that have grown over the
past decades out of national liberation movements also attests to
this.
   This objective fact calls for respect for the views and positions
of others, tolerance, a willingness to perceive something different
as not necessarily bad or hostile, and an ability to learn to live
side-by-side with others, while remaining different and not always
agreeing with each other.
   As the world asserts its diversity, attempts to look down on
others and to teach them one's own brand of democracy become totally
improper, to say nothing of the fact that democratic values intended
for export often very quickly lose their worth.
   What we are talking about, therefore, is unity in diversity. If
we assert this politically, if we reaffirm our adherence to freedom
of choice, then there is no room for the view that some live on
Earth by virtue of divine will while others are here quite by chance.
   The time has come to discard such thinking and to shape our
policies accordingly. That would open up prospects for strengthening
the unity of the world.
   The new phase also requires de-ideologizing relations among
states. We are not abandoning our convictions, our philosophy or
traditions, nor do we urge anyone to abandon theirs.
   But neither do we have any intention to be hemmed in by our
values. That would result in intellectual impoverishment, for it
would mean rejecting a powerful source of development _ the exchange
of everything original that each nation has independently created.
   In the course of such exchange, let everyone show the advantages
of their social system, way of life or values _ and not just by
words or propaganda, but by real deeds.
   That would be a fair rivalry of ideologies. But it should not be
extended to relations among states. Otherwise, we would simply be
unable to solve any of the world's problems, such as:
   _developing wide-ranging mutually beneficial and equitable
cooperation among nations;
   _making efficient use of the achievements of' scientific and
technological revolution;
   _restructuring the world economy and protecting the environment;
   _overcoming backwardness, eliminating hunger, disease, illiteracy
and other global scourges.
   Nor, of course, shall we then be able to eliminate the nuclear
threat and militarism.
   Those are our reflections on the patterns of world development at
the threshold of the 21st century.
   We are, of course, far from claiming to be in possession of the
ultimate truth. But, on the basis of a thorough analysis of the past
and newly emerging realities, we have concluded that it is on those
lines that we should jointly seek the way leading to the supremacy
of the universal human idea over the endless multitude of
centrifugal forces, the way to preserve the vitality of this
civilization, possibly the only one in the entire universe.
   Could this view be a little too romantic? Are we not
overestimating the potential and the maturity of the world's social
consciousness? We have heard such doubts and such questions both in
our country and from some of our Western partners.
   I am convinced that we are not floating above reality.
   Forces have already emerged in the world that in one way or
another stimulate the arrival of a period of peace. The peoples and
large sectors of the public do, indeed, ardently wish for an
improvement in the situation. They want to learn to cooperate.
   It is sometimes even amazing how powerful this trend is. It is
also important that it is beginning to shape policies.
   Changes in philosophical approaches and in political relations
form a solid prerequisite for imparting, in line with worldwide
objective processes, a powerful impetus to the efforts designed to
establish new relations among states.
   Even those politicians whose activities used to be geared to the
Cold War and sometimes linked with its most-critical phases are now
drawing appropriate conclusions. Of all people, they find it
particularly hard to abandon old stereotypes and past practices.
   And if even they are changing course, it is clear that when new
generations take over opportunities will increase in number.
   In short, the understanding of the need for a period of peace is
gaining ground and beginning to prevail. This has made it possible
to take the first real steps in creating a healthier international
environment and in disarmament.
   What are the practical implications of that? It would be natural
and sensible not to abandon everything positive that has already
been accomplished and to build on all the gains of the past few
years, on all that we have created working together.
   I am referring to the process of negotiations on nuclear arms,
conventional weapons and chemical weapons, and to the search for
political approaches to ending regional conflicts.
   Of course, I am referring above all to political dialogue _ a
more intense and open dialogue pointed at the very heart of problems
instead of confrontation, at an exchange of constructive ideas
instead of recriminations. Without political dialogue, the process
of negotiations cannot advance.
   We regard prospects for the near and more distant future quite
optimistically.
   Just look at the changes in our relations with the United States.
Little by little, mutual understanding has started to develop and
elements of trust have emerged, without which it is very hard to
make headway in politics.
   In Europe, these elements are even more numerous. The Helsinki
process is a great process. I believe that it remains fully valid.
Its philosophical, political, practical and other dimensions must
all be preserved and enhanced, while taking into account new
circumstance.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: new circumstance.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Current realities make it imperative that the dialogue that
ensures normal and constructive evolution of international affairs
involve, on a continuous and active basis, all countries and regions
of the world, including such major powers as India, China, Japan,
and Brazil and other countries _ big, medium and small.
   I am in favor of a more dynamic and substantive political
dialogue, of strengthening the political prequisites needed to
improve the international climate. That would make it easier to find
practical solutions to many problems. Tough as it may be, this is
the road that we must travel.
   Everyone should join in the movement toward greater unity of the
world.
   Today, this is particularly important, for we are approaching a
very important point when we shall have to face the question of how
to assure the world's solidarity and the stability and dynamism of
international relations.
   And yet, in my taIks with foreign government and political
leaders, with whom I have had over 200 meetings, I could sometimes
sense their dissatisfaction over the fact that at this crucial time,
for one reason or another, they sometimes find themselves, as it
were, on the sidelines of the main issues of world politics.
   It is natural and appropriate that no one is willing to resign
oneself to that.
   If, although different, we are indeed part of the same
civilization, if we are aware of the interdependence of the
contemporary world, then this fact must be increasingly present in
politics and in the practical efforts to harmonize international
relations. Perhaps, the term perestroika would not be quite
appropriate in this context, but I do call for building new
international relations.
   I am convinced that our time and the realities of today's world
call for internationalizing dialogue and the negotiating process.
   This is the main, the most general conclusion that we have come
to in studying global trends that have been gaining momentum in
recent years, and in participating in world politics.
   In this specific historical situation we face the question of a
new role for the United Nations.
   We feel that states must to some extent review their attitude to
the United Nations, this unique instrument without which world
politics would be inconceivable today.
   The recent reinvigoration of its peacemaking role has again
demonstrated the United Nations' ability to assist its members in
coping with the daunting challenges of our time and working to
humanize their relations.
   Regrettably, shortly after it was established, the organization
went through the onslaught of the Cold War. For many years, it was
the scene of propaganda battles and continuous political
confrontation.
   Let historians argue who is more and who is less to blame for it.
What political leaders today need to do is to draw lessons from that
chapter in the history of the United Nations which turned out to be
at odds with the very meaning and objectives of our organization.
   One of the most bitter and important lessoms lies in the long
list of missed opportunities. As a result, at a certain point the
authority of the United Nations diminished and many of its attempts
to act failed.
   It is highly significant that the reinvigoration of the role of
the United Nations is linked to an improvement in the international
climate.
   In a way, the United Nations blends together the interests of
different states. It is the only organization capable of merging
into a single current their bilateral, regional and global efforts.
   New prospects are opening up for it in all areas that fall
naturally under its responsibility _ in the politico-military,
economic, scientific, technological, environmental, and humanitarian
areas.
   Take, for example, the problem of development, which is a truly
universal human problem. Conditions in which tens of millions of
people live in a number of Third World regions are becoming a real
threat to all mankind.
   No closed entities or even regional communities of states,
important as they are, are capable of untangling the main knots that
tie up the principal avenues of world economic relations _
North-South, East-West, South-South, South-East, and East-East.
   What is needed here is joining the efforts and taking into
account the interests of all groups of countries, something that
only this organization, the United Nations, can accomplish.
   External debt is one of the gravest problems.
   Let us not forget that in the age of colonialism the developing
world, at the cost of countless losses and sacrifices, financed the
prosperity of a large portion of the world community. The time has
come to make up for the losses that accompanied its historic and
tragic contribution to global material progress.
   We are convinced that here, too, internationalizing our approach
shows a way out.
   Looking at things realistically, one has to admit that the
accumulated debt cannot be repaid or recovered on the original terms.
   The Soviet Union is prepared to institute a lengthy moratorium of
up to 100 years on debt servicing by the least developed countries,
and in quite a few cases to write off the debt altogether.
   As regards other developing countries, we invite you to consider
the following:
   _limiting their official debt servicing payments depending on the
economic performance of each of them or granting them a long pariod
of deferral in the repayment of a major portion of their debt;
   _supporting the appeal of the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development for reducing debts owed to commercial banks;
   _guaranteeing government support for market arrangements to
assist in Third World debt settlement, including the formation of a
specialized international agency that would repurchase debts at a
discount.
   The Soviet Union favours a substantive discussion of ways to
settle the debt crisis at multilateral forums, including
consultations under the auspices of the United Nations among heads
of government of debtor and creditor countries.
   International economic security is inconceivable unless related
not only to disarmament but also to the elimination of the threat to
the world's environment. In a number of regions, the state of the
environment is simply frightening.
   A conference on the environment within the framework of the
United Nations is scheduled for 1992. We welcome this decision and
are working to have this forum produce results that would be
commensurate with the scope of the problem.
   But time is running out. Much is being done in various countries.
Here again I would just like to underscore most emphatically the
prospects opening up in the process of disarmament _ particularly,
of course, nuclear disarmament _ for environmental revival.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: environmental revival.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Let us also think about setting up within the framework of the
United Nations a center for emergency environmental assistance. Its
function would be promptly to send international groups of experts
to areas with badly deteriorating environment.
   The Soviet Union is also ready to cooperate in establishing an
international space laboratory or manned orbital station designed
exclusively for monitoring the state of the environment.
   In the general area of space exploration, the outlines of a
future space industry are becoming increasingly clear.
   The position of the Soviet Union is well known: activities in
outer space must rule out the appearance of weapons there. Here
again, there has to be a legal base. The groundwork for it _ the
provisions of the 1967 treaty and other agreements _ is already in
place.
   However, there is already a strongly felt need to develop an
all-embracing regime for peaceful work in outer space. The
verification of compliance with that regime would be entrusted to a
World Space Organization.
   We have put forward our proposal to establish it on more than one
occasion. We are prepared to incorporate within its system our
Krasnoyarsk radar station. A decision has already been taken to
place that radar under the authority of the U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences.
   Soviet scientists are prepared to receive their foreign
colleagues and discuss with them ways of converting it into an
international center for peaceful cooperation by dismantling and
refitting certain units and structures, and to provide additional
equipment.
   The entire system could function under the auspices of the United
Nations.
   The whole world welcomes the efforts of this organization and its
secretary-general, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, and his representatives in
untying knots of regional problems.
   Allow me to elaborate on this.
   Paraphrasing the words of the English poet that Hemingway took as
an epigraph to his famous novel, I will say this: The bell of every
regional conflict tolls for all of us.
   This is particularly true, since those conflicts are taking place
in the Third World, which already faces many ills and problems of
such magnitude that is has to be a matter of concern to us all.
   The year 1988 has brought a glimmer of hope in this area of our
common concerns as well. This has been felt in almost all regional
crises. On some of them, there has been movement. We welcome it and
we did what we could to contribute to it.
   I will single out only Afghanistan.
   The Geneva accords, whose fundamental and practical significance
has been praised throughout the world, provided a possibility for
completing the process of settlement even before the end of this
year. That did not happen.
   This unfortunate fact reminds us again of the political, legal
and moral significance of the Roman maxim: Pacta sunt servanda _
Treaties must be observed.
   I don't want to use this rostrum for recriminations against
anyone.
   But it is our view that, within the competence of the United
Nations, the General Assembly Resolution adopted last November could
be supplemented by some specific measures.
   In the words of that resolution, for the urgent achievement of a
comprehensive solution by the Afghans themselves of the question of
a broad-based government the following should be undertaken:
   _a complete cease-fire effective everywhere as of Jan. 1, l989,
and the cessation of all offensive operations or shellings, with the
opposing Afghan groups retaining, for the duration of negotiations,
all territories under their control;
   _linked to that, stopping as of the same date any supplies of
arms to all belligerents;
   _for the period of establishing a broad-based government, as
provided in the General Assembly resolution, sending to Kabul and
other strategic centres of the country a contingent of United
Nations peace-keeping forces;
   _we also request the secretary-general to facilitate early
implementation of the idea of holding an international conference on
the neutrality and demilitarization of Afghanistan.
   We shall continue most actively to assist in healing the wounds
of the war and are prepared to cooperate in this endeavor both with
the United Nations and on a bilateral basis.
   We support the proposal to create under the auspices of the
United Nations a voluntary international Peace Corps to assist in
the revival of Afghanistan.
   In the context of the problem of settling regional conflicts, I
have to express my opinion on the serious incident that has recently
affected the work of this session. The chairman of an organization
which has observer status at the United Nations was not allowed by
U.S. authorities to come to New York to address the General
Assembly. I am referring to Yasser Arafat.
   What is more, this happened at a time when the Palestine
Liberation Organization has made a constructive step which
facilitates the search for a solution to the Middle East problem
with the involvement of the United Nations Security Council.
   This happened at a time when a positive trend has become apparent
toward a political settlement of other regional conflicts, in many
cases with the assistance of the U.S.S.R. and the United States. We
voice our deep regret over the incident and our solidarity with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Ladies and Gentlemen,
   The concept of comprehensive international security is based on
the principles of the United Nations Charter and is predicated on
the binding nature of international law for all states.
   Being in favor of demilitarizing international relations, we want
political and legal methods to prevail in solving whatever problems
may arise.
   Our ideal is a world community of states, which are based on the
rule of law and which subordinate their foreign policy activities to
law.
   The achievement of this goal would be facilitated by an agreement
within the United Nations on a uniform understanding of the
principles and norms of international law, their codification with
due regard to new conditions, and the development of legal norms for
new areas of cooperation.
   In a nuclear age, the effectiveness of international law should
be based not on enforcing compliance but rather on norms reflecting
a balance of state interests.
   In addition to the ever increasing awareness of the objective
commonality of our destiny, this would make every state genuinely
interested in exercising self-restraint within the bounds of
international law.
   Democratizing international relations means not only a maximum
degree of internationalization in the efforts of all members of the
world community to solve problems. It also means humanizing those
relations.
   International ties will fully reflect the genuine interests of
the peoples and effectively serve the cause of their common security
only when the human being and his concerns, rights and freedoms
become the center of all things.

   In this context I would like to join the voice of my country in
the expressions of high appreciation of the significance of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted 40 years ago on Dec.
10, 1948.
   Today, this document retains its significance. It, too, reflects
the universal nature of the goals and objectives of the United
Nations.
   The most fitting way for a state to observe this anniversary of
the declaration is to improve its domestic conditions for respectlng
and protecting the rights of its own citizens.
   Before I inform you on what specifically we have undertaken
recently in this respect I would like to say the following.
   Our country is going through a period of truly revolutionary
uplifting.
   The process of perestroika is gaining momentum. We began with the
formulation of the theoretical concept of perestroika. We had to
evaluate the nature and the magnitude of problems, to understand the
lessons of the past and express that in the form of political
conclusions and programmes. This was done.
   Theoretical work, a reassessment of what is happening, the
finalization, enrichment and readjustment of political positions
have not been completed. They are continuing.
   But it was essential to begin with an overall concept, which, as
now confirmed by the experience of these past years, has generally
proved to be correct and which has no alternative.
   For our society to participate in efforts to implement the plans
of perestroika, it had to be democratized in practice. Under the
sign of democratization, perestroika has now spread to politics, the
economy, intellectual life and ideology.
   We have initiated a radical economic reform. We have gained
experience. At the start of next year the entire national economy
will be redirected to new forms and methods of operation. This also
means profoundly reorganizing relations of production and releasing
the tremendous potential inherent in socialist property.
   Undertaking such bold revolutionary transformations, we realized
that there would be mistakes, and also opposition, that new
approaches would generate new problems. We also foresaw the
possibility of slowdowns in some areas.
   But the guarantee that the overall process of perestroika will
steadily move forward and gain strength lies in a profound
democratic reform of the entire system of power and administration.
   With the recent decisions by the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet on
amendments to the Constitution and the adoption of the Law on
Elections, we have completed the first stage of the process of
political reform.
   Without pausing, we have begun the second stage of this process
with the main task of improving the relationship between the center
and the republics, harmonizing interethnic relations on the
principles of Leninist internationalism that we inherited from the
Great Revolution, and at the same time reorganizing the local system
of Soviet power.
   A great deal of work lies ahead. Major tasks will have to be
dealt with concurrently.
   We are full of confidence. We have a theory and a policy, and
also the vanguard force of perestroika _ the party, which also is
restructuring itself in accordance with new tasks and fundamental
changes in society as a whole.
   What is most important is that all our peoples and all
generations of citizens of our great country support perestroika.
   We have become deeply involved in building a socialist state
based on the rule of law. Work on a series of new laws has been
completed or is nearing completion.
   Many of them will enter into force as early as in 1989, and we
expect them to meet the highest standards from the standpoint of
ensuring the rights of the individual.
   Soviet democracy will be placed on a solid normative base. I am
referring, in particular, to laws on the freedom of conscience,
glasnost, public associations and organizations, and many others.
   In places of confinement there are no persons convicted for their
political or religious beliefs.
   Additional guarantees are to be included in the new draft laws
that rule out any form of persecution on those grounds.
   Naturally this does not apply to those who committed actual
criminal offenses or state crimes such as espionage, sabotage,
terrorism, etc., whatever their political or ideological beliefs.
   Draft amendments to the penal code have been prepared and are
awaiting their turn. Among the articles being revised are those
related to capital punishment.
   The problem of exit from and entry to our country, including the
question of leaving it for family reunification, is being dealt with
in a humane spirit.
   As you know, one of the reasons for refusal to leave is a
person's knowledge of secrets. Strictly warranted time limitations
on the secrecy rule will now be applied. Every person seeking
employment at certain agencies or enterprises will be informed of
this rule. In case of disputes, there is a right of appeal under the
law.
   This removes from the agenda the problem of the so-called
``refuseniks''.
   We intend to expand the Soviet Union's participation in the
United Nations and CSCE (Conference of Security and Cooperation in
Europe) human rights monitoring arrangements. We believe that the
jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice at the Hague as
regards the interpretation and implementation of agreements on human
rights should be binding on all states.
   We regard as part of the Helsinki process the cessation of
jamming of all foreign radio broadcasts beamed at the Soviet Union.
   Overall, this is our credo. Political problems must be solved
only by political means; human problems, only in a humane way.
   Now let me turn to the main issue _ disarmament, without which
none of the problems of the coming century can be solved.
   International development and communication have been distorted
by the arms race and the militarization of thinking.
   As you know, on Jan. 15, 1986 the Soviet Union put forward a
program of building a nuclear weapon-free world. Translated into
actual negotiating positions, it has already produced material
results.
   Tomorrow marks the first anniversary of the signing of the INF
Treaty. I am therefore particularly pleased to note that the
implementation of the treaty _ the elimination of missiles _ is
proceeding normally, in an atmosphere of trust and business-like
work.
   A large breach has thus been made in a seemingiy unbreakable wall
of suspicion and animosity. We are witnessing the emergence of a new
historic reality _ a turning away from the principle of super
armament to the principle of reasonable defense sufficiency.
   We are present at the birth of a new model of ensuring security _
not through the build-up of arms, as was almost always the case in
the past, but on the contrary, through their reduction on the basis
of compromise.
   The Soviet leadership has decided to demonstrate once again its
readiness to reinforce this healthy process not only by words but
also by deeds.
   Today, I can report to you that the Soviet Union has taken a
decision to reduce its armed forces.
   Within the next two years their numerical strength will be
reduced by 500,000 men. The numbers of conventional armaments will
also be substantially reduced. This will be done unilaterally,
without relation to the talks on the mandate of the Vienna meeting.
   By agreement with our Warsaw Treaty allies, we have decided to
withdraw by 1991 six tank divisions from the GDR, Czechoslovakia and
Hungary, and to disband them.

<TEXT>
   Assault landing troops and several other formations and units,
including assault crossing units with their weapons and combat
equipment, will also be withdrawn from the groups of Soviet forces
stationed in those countries.
   Soviet forces stationed in those countries will be reduced by
50,000 men and their armaments, by 5,000 tanks.
   All Soviet divisions remaining, for the time being, in the
territory of our allies are being reorganized. Their structure will
be different from what it is now; after a major cutback of their
tanks it will become clearly defensive.
   At the same time, we shall reduce the numerical strength of the
armed forces and the numbers of armaments stationed in the European
part of the U.S.S.R.
   In total, Soviet armed forces in this part of our country and in
the territories of our European allies will be reduced by 10,000
tanks, 8,500 artillery systems and 800 combat aircraft.
   Over these two years we intend to reduce significantly our armed
forces in the Asian part of our country, too. By agreement with the
government of the Mongolian People's Republic a major portion of
Soviet troops temporarily stationed there will return home.
   In taking this fundamental decision the Soviet leadership
expresses the will of the people, who have undertaken a profound
renewal of their entire socialist society.
   We shall maintain our country's defense capability at a level of
reasonable and reliable sufficiency so that no one might be tempted
to encroach on the security of the U.S.S.R. and our allies.
   By this action, and by all our activities in favor of
demilitarizing international relations, we wish to draw the
attention of the international community to yet another pressing
problem _ the problem of transition from the economy of armaments to
an economy of disarmament.
   Is conversion of military production a realistic idea? I have
already had occasion to speak about this. We think that, indeed, it
is realistic.
   For its part, the Soviet Union is prepared:
   _in the framework of our economic reform we are ready to draw up
and make public our internal plan of conversion;
   _in the course of 1989 to draw up, as an experiment, conversion
plans for two or three defense plants;
   _to make public our experience in providing employment for
specialists from military industry and in using its equipment,
buildings and structures in civilian production.
   It is desirable that all states, in the first place major
military powers, should submit to the United Nations their national
conversion plans.
   It would also be useful to set up a group of scientists to
undertake a thorough analysis of the problem of conversion as a
whole and as applied to individual countries and regions and report
to the secretary-general of the United Nations, and, subsequently,
to have this matter considered at a session of the General Assembly.
   And finally, since I am here on American soil, and also for other
obvious reasons, I have to turn to the subject of our relations with
this great country. I had a chance to appreciate the full measure of
its hospitality during my memorable visit to Washington exactly a
year ago.
   The relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of
America have a history of 5{ decades. As the world changed, so did
the nature, role and place of those relations in world politics.
   For too long a time they developed along the lines of
confrontation and sometimes animosity _ either overt or covert.
   But in the last few years the entire world could breath a sigh of
relief thanks to the changes for the better in the substance and the
atmosphere of the relationship between Moscow and Washington.
   No one intends to underestimate the seriousness of our
differenees and the toughness of outstanding problems. We have,
however, already graduated from the primary school of learning to
understand each other and seek solutions in both our own and common
interests.
   The U.S.S.R. and the United States have built the largest nuclear
and missile arsenals. But it is those two countries that, having
become specifically aware of their responsibility, were the first to
conclude a treaty on the reduction and physical elimination of a
portion of their armaments which posed a threat to both of them and
to all others.
   Both countries possess the greatest and the most sophisticated
military secrets. But it is those two countries that have laid a
basis for and are further developing a system of mutual verification
both of the elimination of armaments and of the reduction and
prohibition of their production.
   It is those two countries that are accumulating the experience
for future bilateral and multilateral agreements.
   We value this. We acknowledge and appreciate the contribution
made by President Ronald Reagan and by the members of his
administration, particularly Mr. George Shultz.
   All this is our joint investment in a venture of historic
importance. We must not lose this investment, or leave it idle.

   The next U.S. administration headed by President-elect George
Bush will find in us a partner who is ready _ without long pauses or
backtracking _ to continue the dialogue in a spirit of realism,
openness and goodwill, with a willingness to achieve concrete
results working on the agenda which covers the main issues of
Soviet-U.S. relations and world politics.
   I have in mind, above all, consistent movement toward a treaty on
50 percent reductions in strategic offensive arms while preserving
the ABM treaty;
   _working out a convention on the elimination of chemical weapons
_ here, as we see it, prerequisites exist to make 1989 a decisive
year;
   _and negotiations on the reduction of conventional arms and armed
forces in Europe.
   I also have in mind economic, environmental and humanistic
problems in their broadest sense.
   It would be quite wrong to put the positive changes in the
international situation exclusively to the credit of the U.S.S.R.
and the United States.
   The Soviet Union highly appreciates the major and original
contribution of socialist countries in the process of creating a
healthier international environment.
   During the course of negotiations we are constantly aware of the
presence of other major powers, both nuclear and non-nuclear.
   Many countries, including medium-sized and small ones, and, of
course, the Non-Aligned Movement and the intercontinental Group of
Six are playing a uniquely important constructive role.
   We in Moscow are happy that an ever increasing number of
statesmen, political party and public figures and _ I want to
emphasize this _ scientists, cultural figures, representatives of
mass movements and various churches, and activists of the so-called
people's diplomacy, are ready to shoulder the burden of universal
responsibility.
   In this regard, I believe that the idea of convening on a regular
basis, under the auspices of the United Nations, an assembly of
public organizations deserves attention.
   We are not inclined to simplify the situation in the world.
   Yes, the trend touard disarmament has been given a powerful
impetus, and the process is gaining a momentum of its own. But it
has not yet become irreversible.
   Yes, the willingness to give up confrontation in favor of
dialogue and cooperation is felt strongly. But it is still far from
becoming a permanent feature in the practice of international
relations.
   Yes, movement toward a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world
is capable of radically transforming the political and intellectual
identity of our planet. But only the first steps have been made, and
even they have been met with mistrust in certain influential
quarters and face resistance.
   The legacy and the inertia of the past continue to be felt.
Profound contradictions and the roots of many conflicts have not
disappeared. And there remains another fundamental fact which is
that a peaceful period will be taking shape in the context of the
existence and rivalry of different socio-economic and political
systems.
   However, the thrust of our international efforts and one of the
key elements of the new thinking is that this rivalry should be
given a quality of reasonable competition with due regard for
freedom of choice and a balance of interests.
   Then it will even become useful and productive from the
standpoint of global development.
   Otherwise _ if the arms race, as before, remains its basic
component _ this rivalry will be deadly.
   More and more people throughout the world _ leaders a well as
ordinary people _ are beginning to understand.
   Esteemed Mr. President, distinguished delegates,
   I am concluding my first address to the United Nations with the
same feeling that I had when I began it _ a feeling of
responsibllity to my own people and to the world community.
   We are meeting at the end of a year which has meant so much for
the United Nations and on the eve of a year from which we all expect
so much.
   I would like to believe that our hopes will be matched by our
joint effort to put an end to an era of wars, confrontation and
regional conflicts, to aggressions against nature, to the terror of
hunger and poverty as well as to political terrorism.
   This is our common goal and we can only reach it together.
   Thank you.

them. The Soviet Union has 37,000 main battle tanks assigned to the
Warsaw Pact, according to NATO estimates. He said Soviet forces in
those countries would be cut by 50,000 men and by 5,000 tanks.
   _ Soviet forces in the European part of the Soviet Union and in
the territory of the Warsaw Pact countries reduced by 10,000 tanks,
8,500 artillery systems and 800 combat aircraft. NATO estimates are
that the Soviets have 33,000 artillery weapons in the Warsaw Pact
and 6,050 combat aircraft.

   CONVENTIONAL ARMS:
   Today, I can report to you that the Soviet Union has taken a
decision to reduce its armed forces.
   Within the next two years their numerical strength will be
reduced by 500,000 men. The numbers of conventional armaments will
also be substantially reduced. This will be done unilaterally,
without relation to the talks on the mandate of the Vienna meeting.
   By agreement with our Warsaw Treaty allies, we have decided to
withdraw by 1991 six tank divisions from the GDR (East Germany),
Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and to disband them.
   Assault landing troops and several other formations and units,
including assault crossing units with their weapons and combat
equipment, will also be withdrawn from the groups of Soviet forces
stationed in those countries.
   Soviet forces stationed in those countries will be reduced by
50,000 men and their armaments by 5,000 tanks.
   All Soviet divisions remaining, for the time being, in the
territory of our allies are being reorganized. Their structure will
be different from what it is now; after a major cutback of their
tanks it will become clearly defensive.
   At the same time, we shall reduce the numerical strength of the
armed forces and the numbers of armaments stationed in the European
part of the U.S.S.R.
   In total, Soviet armed forces in this part of our countries and
in the territories of our European allies will be reduced by 10,000
tanks, 8,500 artillery systems and 800 combat aircraft.
   Over these two years we intend to reduce significantly our armed
forces in the Asian part of our country, too. By agreement with the
government of the Mongolian People's Republic a major portion of
Soviet troops temporarily stationed there will return home.

   AFGHANISTAN:
   The Geneva accords, whose fundamental and practical significance
has been praised throughout the world, provided a possibility for
completing the process of settlement even before the end of this
year. That did not happen.
   This unfortunate fact reminds us again of the political, legal
and moral significance of the Roman maxim: Pacta sunt servanda! _
Treaties must be observed.
   I don't want to use this rostrum for recriminations against
anyone.
   But it is our view that, within the competence of the United
Nations, the General Assembly resolution adopted last November could
be supplemented by some specific measures.
   In the words of that resolution, for the urgent achievement of a
comprehensive solution by the Afghans themselves of the question of
a broad-based government the following should be undertaken:
   _A complete cease-fire, effective everywhere as of Jan. 1, 1989,
and the cessation of all offensive operations or shellings, with the
opposing Afghan groups retaining, for the duration of negotiations,
all territories under their control.
   _Linked to that, stopping as of the same date any supplies of
arms to all belligerents.
   _For the period of establshing a broad-based government, as
provided in the General Assembly resolution, sending to Kabul and
other strategic centers of the country a contingent of United
Nations peacekeeping forces.
   _We also request the secretary-general to facilitate early
implementation of the idea of holding an international conference on
the neutrality and demilitarization of Afghanistan.
   We shall continue most actively to assist in healing the wounds
of the war and are prepared to cooperate in this endeavor both with
the United Nations and on a bilateral basis.
   We support the proposal to create under the auspices of the
United Nations a voluntary international Peace Corps to assist in
the revival of Afghanistan.

   HUMAN RIGHTS:
   Soviet democracy will be placed on a solid normative base. I am
referring, in particular, to laws on the freedom of conscience,
glasnost, public associations and organizations, and many others.
   In places of confinement there are no persons convicted for their
political or religious beliefs.
   Additional guarantees are to be included in the new draft laws
that rule out any form of persecution on those grounds.
   Naturally this does not apply to those who committed actual
criminal offenses or state crimes such as espionage, sabotage,
terrorism, etc., whatever their political or ideological beliefs.
   Draft amendments to the penal code have been prepared and are
awaiting their turn. Among the articles being revised are those
related to capital punishment.
   The problem of exit from and entry to our country, including the
question of leaving it for family reunification, is being dealt with
in a humane spirit.
   As you know, one of the reasons for refusal to leave is a
person's knowledge of secrets. Strictly warranted time limitations
on the secrecy rule will now be applied. Every person seeking
employment at certain agencies or enterprises will be informed of
this rule. In case of disputes, there is a right of appeal under the
law.
   This removes from the agenda the problem of the so-called
``refuseniks''.
   We intend to expand the Soviet Union's participation in the
United Nations and CSCE (Conference of Security and Cooperation in
Europe) human rights monitoring arrangements. We believe that the
jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice at the Hague as
regards the interpretation and implementation of agreements on human
rights should be binding on all states.
   We regard as part of the Helsinki process the cessation of
jamming of all foreign radio broadcasts beamed at the Soviet Union.
   Overall, this is our credo. Political problems must be solved
only by political means; human problems, only in a humane way.

   ENVIRONMENT:
   Let us also think about setting up within the framework of the
United Nations a center for emergency environmental assistance. Its
function would be promptly to send international groups of experts
to areas with badly deteriorating environment.
   The Soviet Union is also ready to cooperate in establishing an
international space laboratory or manned orbital station designed
exclusively for monitoring the state of the environment.

   SPACE EXPLORATION:
   In the genral area of space exploration, the outlines of a future
space industry are becoming increasingly clear.
   The position of the Soviet Union is well known: activities in
outer space must rule out the appearance of weapons there. Here
again, there has to be a legal base. The groundwork for it _ the
provisions of the 1967 treaty and other agreements _ is already in
place.
   However, there is already a strongly felt need to develop an
all-embracing regime for peaceful work in outer space. The
verification of compliance with that regime would be entrusted to a
World Space Organization.
   We have put forward our proposal to establish it on more than one
occasion. We are prepared to incorporate within its system our
Krasnoyarsk radar station. A decision has already been taken to
place that radar under the authorities of the U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences.
   Soviet scientists are prepared to receive their foreign
colleagues and discuss with them ways of converting it into an
international center for peaceful cooperation by dismantling and
refitting certain units and structures, and to provide additional
equipment.
   The entire system could function under the auspices of the United
Nations.

   Here is the text of Secretary of State George P.
Shultz's news conference on Governors Island:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SHULTZ: The president, the vice president and the general
secretary, and the accompanying parties, just finished a set of
meetings, first a private meeting between the three men, and then
the general discussion over lunch, that I think can well be
characterized as a discussion that was direct and open, lots of
humor, cordial, and marked by a general desire for a continued
positive development in relationship between the United States and
the Soviet Union.
   In the discussion among the three, the subjects, as I heard them
reported to me, were, first of all, a discussion of human rights;
second, some discussion of changes taking place in the Soviet Union;
and some looking back and remembering that this was the fifth
meeting between the president and the general secretary, and the
general secretary remarked that it was a special meeting because of
the vice president's presence. And there was some recall of the
first one in Geneva.
   Over lunch, we had a kind of intermingling of substantive and
cordial informal talk about such a variety of things as the politics
of change, the difficulties with bureaucracies, the health-giving
properties of horses, as the president somehow got onto that subject
and talked about it .... (Laughter). I think the General Secretary
brought it up, and we were off for a good ride. But at any rate, the
whole atmosphere was very informal and cordial, and flowed back and
forth between substance and general informal talk.
   The general secretary gave a report on the earthquake that
affected Armenia principally, but other areas of the Soviet Union
and Turkey as well; very serious in some places. The president
expressed his sympathy. The President had had a brief report on the
general secretary's speech at the United Nations. He wasn't able to
see it, of course, because he was in the air most of the time. I
told him a bit about it, and the president remarked that he could
see that it was a constructive and important speech.
   As far as the statements about conventional arms reductions are
concerned, the president welcomed them. As described, they are, of
course, decisions made by the Soviet Union about unilateral steps
that they intend to take.
   There was some general discussion over luncheon about the
relationship of perestroika to developments in human rights and
legal changes, as these were outlined by the general secretary in
his speech. And again, the president expressed his welcome of those
developments.
   We had some discussion of the Krasnoyarsk radar, and it was
pointed out that in his speech, the general secretary had used the
word ``dismantled,'' did we hear that word right? And he said,
``Yes, that was the word I used.'' But it wasn't pursued further
than that.
   There was a fairly lengthy period of discussion about chemical
weapons and the importance of concluding a protocol or a treaty in
Geneva to ban them. The vice president, on the one hand, argued for
the importance of doing that, and on the other hand pointed up how
difficult it is, particularly on verification, so there's lots of
work to do. And there was general support for the effort to
highlight this area, represented by the conference in Paris that is
to take place.

<TEXT>
   There was discussion of regional issues. The president mentioned
the cooperative effort that we are making together on Southern
Africa. The general secretary commented on his readiness to continue
cooperation on seeking peace in the Middle East. And while we were
waiting for the private meeting to end, Mr. Shevardnadze and I
discussed Cambodia at some length, and his meeting and the general
secretary's meeting with the Chinese foreign minister, and Korea.
There were also references to people-to-people exchanges.
   So you can see that all elements of what we have described as the
four-part agenda came into play, although this was not a kind of
formal meeting, so it was an informal flow from one thing to
another, but I think in many respects very illuminating, as the _
one person or another was drawn out on a subject in an informal way.
And in that sense, served a good purpose of people not only saying
that they wished to see continuity, but in the interplay, kind of
bringing that about by virtue of the presence of the vice president
and the president together there with the general secretary.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, did you have any reaction to his criticism of
our decision on the PLO? Did that come up during the meeting? Do you
have any reaction to what he said during his speech, independent of
whether that came up? And do you have any comment on Mr. Arafat's
meeting in Sweden?
   SHULTZ: Well, as far as his comments in his speech are concerned,
I have, we have described at length the reasons for my decision. The
president supports that decision. Most members of the United States
Senate do. I recognize there are many differences of opinion, and he
expressed his, but that's where we are.
   As far as the meeting in Stockholm is concerned, I read the
report of what was said this morning, and it seems to be a little
bit further clarification, and I welcome that. And there's still a
considerable distance to go.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, this unilateral troop reduction that Gorbachev
announced seems to amount to about 10 percent of Soviet and Eastern
Bloc forces in that area. Does it appear to you at first glance that
that will bring a parity about, because we contend that the Eastern
Bloc has superiority in conventional forces now?
   SHULTZ: There is a superiority, more troops, more tanks, more
various other categories of weapons. And these reductions, being
unilateral, are a welcome and significant step in the right
direction. But even after they're completed in 1991, there still
will be a very significant asymmetry. So there's a lot of
negotiating to do.

   I think the principal thing that is notable about them, as
described in the speech and then as asked about them during our
meeting, is the attention to trying to affect things like bridging
capabilities that are offensive in nature, and therefore, to try to
have the forces arranged so that they're more clearly defensive in
their nature. But it still remains that after these reductions take
place, and if nothing else takes place, there will be a major
asymmetry in important categories of force structure for the Soviet
Union. But nevertheless, this is a welcome step in the right
direction.
   Q: Can I just follow that up? That was the point that Mr.
Gorbachev made. He said that at the end of these reductions would be
clear that his forces were in a defensive posture. What do you think?
   SHULTZ: Some of the reductions _ and I mentioned an illustration
_ seemed to be pointed in that direction and that's a welcome
development. Obviously, we have sat _ I have sat in the hall and
others watched on television his exposition of this, and so, I'm
giving you a general reaction. But obviously, we're going to sit and
study this out carefully in the United States and in NATO and factor
it into our thinking about how to position ourselves in the coming
conventional arms talks.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, do you agree with Mr. Gorbachev there are no
political prisoners in the Soviet Union? And could you tell us what
you think _ you're getting two questions here for the price of one _
what do you think of his proposal for a mutual suspension of arms
supplies to the belligerents in Afghanistan?
   SHULTZ: Well, as far as prisoners of conscience, political,
religious prisoners are concerned, there have been a great many
released _ a great many. In our opinion, there still are such
prisoners in the Soviet Union, but the number is far less in our
count. Now, there can be differences of opinion about whether
somebody is in prison because of political expression or religious
expression or because of violation of the law. So, what we need and
what I believe it will be possible to construct is a procedure _ a
means _ through which we will go through with them name by name the
people on our list and try to determine whether or not that person
should be released or whether there is some valid reason for the
imprisonment. And I believe that we will be able to get that into
place, and so that'll be a way of answering the question in a kind
of direct, personal sense. Now, you're other question was what?
   Q: The proposal _ he had a very detailed proposal including the
mutual suspension of assistance and military supplies to the
belligerents in Afghanistan. Is that a good idea?
   SHULTZ: Well, of course, we proposed to the Soviet Union quite
some time ago a mutual cessation of supplies, and they rejected
that. And so, as we insisted and they agreed that there had to be
symmetry, we said, ``Well, if you insist on supplying, then we
insist that we will have that right.'' Actually, the mujahedeen
don't need a lot of more supplies because they're capturing a great
deal of supplies.
   But, at any rate, we have been prepared for such a proposal, but
it is tied in with a lot of other things. Of course, the question of
peacekeeping, of trying to help people with reconstruction and
development, that there will be a massive effort needed.
   But, I don't think there is any way there could be agreement that
forces would just continue to hold the ground that they have because
the people of Afghanistan, broadly speaking, do not accept the fact
that the puppet regime is entitled to hold certain areas of that
country.
   Let's review the situation.
   There were 15{ million people estimated as the population of
Afghanistan in 1979. Right now there are a little over three million
refugees in Pakistan, a little over two million in Iran. It's
estimated there are a million and a half casualties, over two
million internal refugees.
   So, I don't think it's surprising that people who have been
subjected to that kind of turmoil don't want to have anything to do
with a puppet regime that seemed to have participated in it.
   Now, I think it is a good thing that the Soviets are now talking
directly to the mujahedeen. And certainly, it is possible the
mujahedeen are ready to negotiate arrangements whereby there won't
be attacks on Soviet forces as they leave. But the key here is,
first and foremost, for the Soviet troops to leave as they are
scheduled to do. And I believe and hope that that will take place.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, you mentioned in your opening statement that
the presence of Vice President Bush himself meant a certain
continuity in the relationship. Was there any discussion there of
meetings between Mr. Bush when he becomes president and Mr.
Gorbachev, or of their foreign ministers or any of these other
apparatus of meetings that we have seen over the past several years?
   SHULTZ: There were general references to the desirability of
having the level of contact, the intensity of contacts at all levels
maintained. There's no immediate plan for any meeting that came out
of the session, as I saw it, of the vice president, when he becomes
president, and the general secretary, although obviously there will
be one at some appropriate moment. No doubt there'll be a foreign
ministers' meeting or two before that. But as the vice president has
said publicly, he has to review the bidding for himself with his new
team and assess the various elements in the relationship. And no
doubt he'll proceed to do that, and things will move forward on an
orderly basis. But the underlying intent is to see things develop in
a positive way insofar as it's possible. And it certainly is quite
possible.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, returning to one of your answers earlier, your
comment on Yasser Arafat's statement in Sweden. You said, ``There's
a considerable way to go.'' A considerable way to go before what? Is
the U.S., having heard these kinds of comments from Arafat, now
prepared to enter a dialogue of any sort of representative of the
PLO?
   SHULTZ: We have, for a long time, had certain set things that we
have said must be said by the PLO, positions they need to adopt, if
we are to have a substantive dialogue with them. And they're well
known. It is the acceptance of U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338 as a
basis for negotiation of Mideast peace; number two, recognition of
Israel's right to exist; and number three, the renunciation of
terrorism in all its forms and a pledge not to engage in it. Those
are the things that we have insisted on. And it is our view that
they need to be said directly, not inferentially, not conditioned.
   So we have seen, at the PNC meeting _ and while I haven't had a
chance to study what was said this morning, I've just heard a brief
report of it, so I don't want to be too definitive about it _ but it
seems that there were some further clarifications in it. I welcome
that. But so far as it's been reported to me, they haven't meet
these conditions. If they meet these conditions, then we're prepared
for a substantive dialogue. We've said that. We'll continue to say
that. That's our position.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, could you give us a bit more of an idea of what
the vice president contributed to today's forum?
   SHULTZ: Well, the vice president was quite active in the
discussion during the luncheon. I can't really say from firsthand in
the private meeting, but I gather that he spoke there, too.
Naturally, he is _ he came here very deliberately as the vice
president, and so it was up to the president to carry the meeting,
which he did, as he always does. But the vice president was very
active in the discussion about chemical weapons.

   And he made his comments about continuity, and at the same time
his own need, of course, to study the situation for himself and
develop his own positions. So, he was in and out of the conversation
in a very comfortable and strong way.
   Q: It's not clear to me how much real discussion there was on
Gorbachev's conventional cut proposal.
   SHULTZ: There was very little discussion of it at the luncheon.
And you have to remember, he made this speech this morning. The
president and the vice president, neither one of them heard it, and
I heard it, but it was an extensive thing and we tried to write it
down as best we can, but that's no basis for having any intensive
discussion beyond asking him, well, what does he have in mind? He
has in mind trying to restructure things so that they're more
clearly defensive in nature. So we are interested in that comment
and we'll study this carefully.
   Q: You didn't draw him out and he didn't really elaborate that
much on his proposal?
   SHULTZ: Well, I've reported on the range of things that we talked
about. The meeting was a luncheon broad discussion. It was a very _
I thought it was a very _ it was a very interesting luncheon to take
part in. It was _ hit interesting topics, and there was a good flow
across things that had important substance connected with them, and
at the same time rather informal. And Mr. Gorbachev talked about the
situation in Azerbaijan and what that meant, and so on. It was that
kind of a discussion. It wasn't in any remote sense a negotiating
session or anything of that kind, but in many ways better than a
negotiating session.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, in his speech, Soviet leader Gorbachev talked
several times about new thinking. He talked about the need for
cooperation, coexistence of several systems. Do you believe that
this new thinking is for real, to stay? An element of propaganda?
   SHULTZ: I'll just give you my own opinion. I don't think there is
a shadow of a doubt that an effort is under way to change the nature
of the Soviet system. That is what Mr. Gorbachev says. That is what
all of the evidence that we can see suggests. So I _ (chuckling) _ I
don't have any doubt that that's so. Now, how successful can he be
in making these changes, and how fast will it happen? Of course
nobody can answer those questions. But that there is a major effort
going on to change things, I really don't see how that's even an
open question.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: open question.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Do you agree with his appeal then that the days of the cold
war are past?
   SHULTZ: Well, I listened to the vice president answer that
question yesterday. I thought he gave a pretty good answer, which
was, the words ``cold war'' mean one thing to you, another thing to
me, another thing to somebody else. And I think the important point
is that there has been a very powerful change in the nature of the
relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and more
broadly, in the East-West relationship. And you can see it in the
things that have been settled in arms control; you can see it in,
for example, the ability we have to collaborate effectively, for
example, in what we're doing in Southern Africa; you can see it in
an altogether different manner of discussion of the area of human
rights; you can see it in our bilateral relations. So I don't know
whether you want to say that's the end of the cold war or not, but
it's different, a lot different, and for my tastes, a lot better.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, with respect to the last answer, if you could
amplify it, do you have any concern that the allies will show
disagreement about what is going on in the Soviet Union?
Particularly, do you have any concern that the level of credit going
from the Europeans to the Soviet Union might not serve to dismantle
the Soviet's military (inaudible)?
   SHULTZ: Well, we meet a lot, the allies do, the European allies,
and we and the Japanese, and Koreans, Australians and so forth. We
have a very active process of talk among us that goes on constantly.
As soon as we get through here I get on my plane and go to Brussels,
and I'll spend all day tomorrow and Friday morning with the NATO
allies; and I'll spend Friday afternoon at the European Commission.
And these are the things we talk about. And people have different
views, but we kind of put them in a pot and look at them, and there
has emerged from it a rather common view and a cohesive set of
policies. And of course it's a constant sort of a moving target in a
way.
   Now, as far as credit is concerned, we have a general
understanding that non-COCOM restricted trade with the Soviet Union
is _ no one sees any problem with that, and that if there are
credits, they should be on a strictly commercial basis. No one feels
that it is _ that the Soviet Union _ should be subsidized. So, after
you've said that, then you observe these credits and, in terms of
the total flow of such things at this point, at least it doesn't
appear to me to be any particular problem. But, the creditors as
commercial creditors, of course, have to ask themselves, ``I'm going
to loan some money. Am I going to get it back? Am I going to get it
serviced,'' and so on. They have to make those calculations as
people whose money that is.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, can you say whether or not Mr. Gorbachev's
assurances on....
   SHULTZ: I can't hear you.
   Q: Can you say whether Mr. Gorbachev's assurances on
institutionalizing human rights reforms in the Soviet Union were
satisfactory enough to now conclude the Vienna talks and go on to
the conventional force talks?
   SHULTZ: Well, as far as the Vienna talks are concerned, of
course, this is a multinational negotiation and we reflect our views
into that in Vienna and decisions will have to emerge from that
setting. But, I think there is no question that in his speech Mr.
Gorbachev touched all of the key issues that we have been
discussing. One of them was the importance of institutionalizing and
making law, making rules, whereby things are regulated so you get
away from ad hoc decisions by some person in the bureaucracy that
say, ``Yes, we'll let this person go or we won't let that person
go,'' and rather you say, ``There is a regulation about, for
instance, the question of security secrets and there'll be a time
limit and there'll be an understanding when somebody is hired,'' and
so on. So, we welcome that kind of procedure.
   Now, what will we want to do? Well, we will want to dig in with
them and get the detail that lies underneath the statements that the
general secretary made in his speech today. However, when the leader
of the Soviet Union gets up in front of the world, in effect, and
says that they are going to do certain things, then I think you have
to expect that those things are going to happen. And we will, of
course, explore them. But, I thought that it was a very helpful
speech in that regard.
   STAFF: We have just time for one more question.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, in his speech, Mr. Gorbachev also referred to
the START talks and recommitted himself to the goal of a 50 percent
reduction in strategic weapons. Was that discussed in the lunch at
all or in the meeting this afternoon, particularly in the context of
continuing these under President Bush?
   SHULTZ: It really wasn't discussed much beyond the general
secretary mentioning it and the vice president saying that, of
course he was interested in that, but he will have to study it for
himself and take his position. So that's about the extent of it.
There wasn't any detailed discussion of that, just as there wasn't
any sort of detailed, negotiator-like discussion of any of these
issues. It was a much more general kind of discussion.
   Q: Well, when you say that the vice president will actually
decide on his position on it, do you have any reason to doubt that
those negotiations will continue in the next administration and be
precedent?
   SHULTZ: Well, I would think that they would be, but a new
president comes in, he collects a new national security group around
him, so naturally he will want to look at the various positions that
have been taken and where the issues now are and what are his views
about them. And since the vice president has been part of what has
happened in the Reagan administration, there is a certain built-in
presumption of continuity, but I think that the vice president is
quite correct in saying, obviously, he's a new president, and he's
got to look at it for himself and decide for himself where he wants
to go. So he's, I think, being properly straightforward in saying
he's going to do that, while, at the same time, expressing his
general view of the importance of continuity in that and other
things.
   Q: And did he tell Secretary Gorbachev that?
   (No response.)

<HEAD>Text of Reagan's Remarks at American Enterprise Institute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Reagan's remarks
at the annual dinner of the American Enterprise Institute:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   REAGAN: (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. And thank
you, President Ford, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Michael Novak, Irving
Crystal and Bill Butcher for those humbling words of praise. And
thank you, Chris DeMuth, for the honor that you have bestowed upon
me.
   I think the honor you pay me is more truly due to everyone here
tonight, for many of the ideas that animated our administration can
trace their ancestry to the pens and typewriters and word processors
of all of you.
   Of course, it would be a massive understatement to say I see a
lot of familiar faces in this room. In fact, for a minute, I thought
I'd stumbled into the White House mess _ (laughter) _ but then I
remembered you don't have to wear black tie in the mess. Well, not
until January 20th, anyway. (Laughter, applause.)
   But as you know, I've just been to New York and back for a
meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev. We were joined by Vice President
Bush. Our discussions were positive and encouraging, as usual, and I
was pleased by this opportunity to have a last meeting with
President Gorbachev before leaving office.
   The discussion covered our entire four-part agenda with the
Soviet Union, and he looked in particular at what had been achieved
since our last meeting in Moscow, and what still needed to be
accomplished in the future.
   I expressed to President Gorbachev my confidence that the work we
began together at Geneva in 1985 will continue under the Bush
administration.
   You will not be surprised to hear that I particularly stressed
the importance of human rights in U.S.-Soviet relations. (Applause.)
   I told the president that we Americans welcomed the changes that
he has initiated in the Soviet Union, and we hope that much more
will be done to benefit the Soviet people, and also the relations
between our countries.
   We also reviewed progress in arms control, resolution of regional
conflicts, and our bilateral relationship. I think we both expressed
satisfaction in what we have achieved in recent years. But we also
recognized that fundamental differences between our countries remain
in many areas, and that determined efforts by both sides will be
necessary in the months and years ahead to overcome such differences.
   Now, I don't need to tell all of what this may mean _ it would be
useless anyway, since over the course of the next few days I'll
probably be reading immensely informed and pointed articles about
what it means in all sorts of publications _ (laughter) _ and
they'll all be by people in this room. (Laughter.)
   About the Soviet unilateral troop reduction, I can only say that
if it is carried out speedily and in full, history will regard it as
important _ significant.
   And we did see history today. An American president and vice
president meeting a president of the Soviet Union under the gaze of
the Statue of Liberty, well, it's something to remember. (Applause.)
   Now, all of this is testimony to a process that was begun in 1985
in Geneva. Testimony, too, to the sacrifices of the people of the
free world throughout the post-war era.
   So while our hopes today are for a new era, let us remember if
that new era is indeed upon us, that there was nothing inevitable
about it. It was the result of hard work _ and of resolve and
sacrifice on the part of those who love freedom and dare to strive
for it.
   Let us remember, too, at this critical junction, our
responsibilities grow more, not less, serious. We must remain strong
and free of illusion _ for only by doing so can we reach out and
embrace this new era and transfrom this hope of peace and freedom
for all the world into reality.

<TEXT>
   So the meeting today was a time for reflection and for
continuity. Now let me do the same with you and consider how we've
done these last eight years and whether we've done well. And I do
mean ``we.''
   We have come a long way together _ from the intellectual
wilderness of the 1960s, through the heated intellectual battles of
the 1970s, to the intellectual fruition of the 1980s.
   The American Enterprise Institute stands at the center of a
revolution in ideas of which I, too, have been a part. Our ideas
were greeted with varying degrees of scorn and hostility by what we
used to call the ``establishment'' institutions.
   The universities, once the only real home for American
scholarships, have been particularly unresponsive. And so it became
necessary to create our own research institutions as places where
scholars could congregate and important studies could be produced
that did not kow-tow to the conventional wisdom. And your
institution's remarkably distinguished body of work is testimony to
the triumph of the think tank.
   For today, the most important American scholarship comes out of
our think tanks, and no think tank has been more influential than
the American Enterprise Institute. (Applause.)
   What we wanted was a chance to try our ideas out on the world
stage. We have. And my friends, I hope you're as proud as I,
because, despite the naysayers and the conventional wisdom, the
words of the pundits, and the false prophecies of false Cassandras
who proclaimed we could not succeed, we knew we were right.
   And I believe that, yes, we have been vindicated.
   And nowhere is that more true than in the realm of foreign
policy. We came to Washington together in 1981, both as
anti-communists and as unapologetic defenders and promoters of a
strong and vibrant America. I am proud to say I am still an
anti-communist _ (applause). And I continue to be dedicated to the
idea that we must trumpet our beliefs and advance our American
ideals to all the peoples of the world until the towers of the
tyrants crumble to dust.
   Yes, it seems to me that we've been as one these past eight years
in an effort to establish a foreign policy that stood in firm
opposition to the previous decade's misguided attempt to place this
country on what they used to call, in the 1970s, the ``right side of
history'' _ by which those who used that unpleasant Marxist phrase
meant we should accept the dominion of our adversaries over large
parts of the world.
   We said no. We said we must propound and advance our national
ideals abroad and once again hold high the banner for what I will,
until the breath is gone from my body, continue to call ``the free
world.'' (Applause.)
   We promulgated a foreign policy whose fundamental basis was the
truths all Americans hold to be self-evident: That all men are
created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with
unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.
   We have done this, not solely because we believe it is right, but
because we know it is in our national interest to do so.
   A foreign policy based on our bedrock principles allows us to
offer a practical solution to the suffering peoples of the world, a
means of achieving prosperity and political stability that all
Americans take for granted as their birthright.
   What we are telling them _ and their ofttimes recalcitrant
leaders _ is that they cannot achieve prosperity and stability
through redistribution of resources, or by taking up arms against a
sea of self-inflicted troubles.
   We've seen how that last monstrous idea has worked this decade _
the war between Iran and Iraq, whose initial aim was control over an
oil-rich province, has done more damage to both countries than 10
plagues.

   WASHINGTON: 10 plagues.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   No, we have told the world the truth we have learned from the
noble tradition of Western culture, and that is that the only answer
to poverty, to war, to oppression is one simple word: Freedom.
   Now, freedom is not only a moral imperative for our foreign
policy, it's also _ if I may use a word for which few in this room
have much use _ supremely pragmatic. For if there is anything the
world has learned in the 1980s, it is that, as Alan Keyes has said,
freedom works.
   That is a historic lesson, because until very recently many
intellectuals believed to the contrary. They supported political
philosophies that argued for tyranny, and more particularly,
communist tyranny.
   The claim was that these tyrannies worked better than freedom and
were more equitable. These intellectuals believed that the people of
Mao's China, Ho's Vietnam, Castro's Cuba, and other socialist
utopias were actually happy to sacrifice their freedom for food and
shelter and so-called literacy programs.
   These noxious ideas have not, to put it mildly, withstood the
scrutiny of honest scholars and the testimony of those fortunate
enough to escape from those national prison camps.
   Refugees have told us what diligent researchers at AEI were
meticulously demonstrating _ that where there is little freedom,
there is little food. That where there is totalitarian
indoctrination instead of education, literacy programs are a form of
spiritual and psychological coercion. That in these countries,
infant mortality is shockingly high and is getting worse. That the
poverty-stricken tyrannies of the 1980s have only grown poorer and
poorer. That tyranny is a parasite that saps the strength of a
nation in its sway. That, like those who lived under Macbeth's
tyranny, the tyrannized millions will ever cry out: ``Our country
sinks beneath the yoke _ it weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a
gash is added to her wounds.''
   Tyranny fails. Freedom works. These facts, so little accepted
only a decade ago, are now indisputable. There is little need here
to rehearse the evidence in great detail.
   The tiny free-exchange experiments in the East bloc and the
liberalization in the People's Republic of China are stunning
evidence of the communist world's desperate efforts to find a way
out of the economic morass of state socialism.
   At the same time, the abject failure of the Sandinistas in
Nicaragua _ a nation where the standard of living has dropped
precipitously since the 1979 revolution _ is stark proof of
communism's inherent inability to compel an enslaved population to
do much of anything but suffer.
   I know it is often said of me that I am an optimist.
   Over the years I've been described as an inveterate optimist, an
eternal optimist, a reflexive optimist _ (scattered laughter) _ a
born optimist, a canny optimist, a cagey optimist, even as, quote,
``defiantly optimistic,'' unquote. (Laughter.)
   It just goes to show, there is no word that cannot be turned into
a pejorative if the pundits work hard enough at it. (Laughter,
applause.)
   But yes, I am perfectly happy to admit that I am an optimist, and
I would like to explain why I believe _ in contrast to some of you
here tonight _ that optimism is an appropriate attitude to bring to
bear when thinking about our foreign policy.
   The story of this century is actually two stories. It's a
terrible story of world wars, totalitarian enslavement,
concentration camps. But it is also the story of freedom _ the
fulfillment of the promise of freedom inside the United States and
the triumph of democratic systems in Western Europe, Japan, Israel,
El Salvador, and many other places.
   We have seen the thrilling spectacle of mankind refusing to
accept the shackles placed upon us when we read the works of
Solzhenitsyn and Valladares, consider the heroism of Sharansky and
Sakharov, and watch in wonder these last months as hundreds of
thousands throughout the captive nations gather to press for freedom.
   Now, one may, if one chooses, take the first story as the
representative tale of the 20th century. Well, I look to the second,
and find glorious examples of what freedom can bring.
   I think of how astonishing it is that Italy and Germany and
Japan, three nations that engaged us in a struggle literally to the
death, have in just two score become our brethren, our friends.
   The nations of Western Europe, which existed in a state you might
call ``cold war'' for most of the past millennium with periods of
real war thrown into the bargain, are now the best of friends and
are on the verge of creating the world's largest free market.
   Latin America, once a despot's paradise, is now 90 percent
democratic. The brave people of El Salvador have faced down those
who would still their voices by turning out to vote in great number.
   In the Far East, democracy has taken unprecedented strides in
such countries as South Korea and the Philippines.
   Freedom works, and freedom is on the march, and yes, I am an
optimist, and yes, I believe I have every reason to be.
   I am an optimist because we are rapidly developing the means to
neutralize the extraordinary threat of nuclear missiles through our
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   I an an optimist because I believe that we have proved with our
policy of peace through strength that when we are strong, peace and
freedom will prevail.
   This November, the electorate told us they agreed.
   But while I believe that optimism is appropriate, and while I
believe that freedom is on the march, I believe optimism must be
tempered with prudence and its assumptions challenged every waking
moment of every day.
   The new democracies around the world are fragile, and inattention
to their fragility and their needs may result in the end of freedom
there.
   In Central America, our policy of peace through strength has been
undercut by a wavering Democrat-controlled Congress that seems less
concerned about the threat of a consolidated Marxist-Leninist regime
in Nicaragua than the possibility of scoring points against a policy
so closely associated with our administration.
   And yes, I still believe the noble freedom fighters who have been
battling for the soul of their homeland continue to be the best hope
for freedom and democracy in Nicaragua. (Applause.)
   I am troubled by something else, as well.
   The 1980s have been the glory years of the NATO alliance. The
Soviet deployment of intermediate-range missiles presented NATO with
its greatest challenge since the construction of the Berlin Wall,
and the alliance not only survived, but was vindicated by the
signing of the INF Treaty in Washington one year ago tomorrow.
   The NATO alliance is the best example we have to show the less
fortunate peoples of the world how freedom and democracy create
friendship and comity between peoples and nations.
   But 40 _ (scattered applause) _ but 40 years after the North
Atlantic Treaty, there are still some who question the Alliance.
Thus we hear, just months after the destruction of the first
intermediate-range missile, that somehow the United States is being
mistreated by our friends and allies.
   The argument they use is that our allies are not sharing their
burden of their own defense equitably.
   I agree that our NATO allies could be sharing the burden better.
But we must also solve our economic disputes more fairly.
   But we must always remember the very real burden our allies bear
that we never will. We must remember our allies perform a role that
geography has forced upon them.
   They are literally on the front lines for the West. Our fortunate
geography has kept the wars of the 20th century well away from the
American mainland, but in Europe, the memory is as fresh as the
memories of a 50-year-old and the tales of a grandfather.

   Their soldiers, their children, their homes, their civilization
itself hang in the balance every day. We cannot, we must not, forget
this. And we should not give in to the temptation to transmute a
small difference in a historic relationship into a major
disagreement that might end up damaging the greatest foreign-policy
success of the post-war era.
   I believe we can and will make progress on these matters as long
as we hold true to our principles and do not give up the battle.
   Now, I would like to ask those of you in this room who consider
yourselves foreign policy skeptics to do me one last favor. I want
to ask you to remain vigilant.
   You are the people who play the vital role of reminding
politicians and policy-makers of many important and necessary truths
we sometimes forget.
   It's true that sometimes you can't see the forest for the trees;
indeed, sometimes you can't even see the trees for the grass that
surrounds them.
   So please, for George Bush's sake and for the sake of all we hold
dear, please keep watching the forest.
   I take my leave of you now by offering a final prayer that God
may bless and keep all of you all the days of your life. Thank you
and good night. (Applause.)

   Visitors to the USS Arizona Memorial received a
very personal reminder of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor: a
single flower and the name of one person killed on that fateful
morning 47 years ago.
   ``We wanted to personalize it for them, so they could think of
the loss in terms of one human life, rather than just the huge total
number,'' National Park Service spokesman Mike Stuckey said
Wednesday, the anniversary of the attack.
   More than 2,400 people were killed and 1,200 wounded on Dec. 7,
1941, the day President Franklin D. Roosevelt said would ``live in
infamy.'' The USS Arizona suffered the heaviest losses, with 1,177
fatalities.
   ``History was to prove these men did not die in vain. ... We have
become a symbol of freedom, of democracy and of world leadership,''
Adm. David E. Jeremiah, commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet,
said at a private Navy service aboard the Arizona memorial.
   About 150 people, including survivors, military officials and
Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, attended the ceremony aboard the
memorial, which spans the sunken hull of the ship.
   A minute of silence was observed at 7:55 a.m., the moment the
first bombs fell. The silence was broken as National Guard jets
roared overhead in ``missing man'' formation. The ceremony ended
with prayers, a 21-gun salute and Marine Corps buglers playing taps.
   The Park Service said about 3,000 people attended a simultaneous
on-shore ceremony to commemorate the assault that plunged the United
States into World War II. About 5,000 others attended programs and
lectures throughout the day at the memorial and visitor center.
   A survivor who has attended nearly 20 anniversary services said
his sorrow for lost friends deepens each year.
   ``I've been coming to these tributes forever, and they're almost
the same every time, but I get more emotional every year,'' said
Louis Grabinski, 68, of Long Beach, Calif. ``When I hear taps, I
still get choked up, because I know who they're playing for.''
   Grabinski, then a 21-year-old shipfitter, was resting aboard the
USS West Virginia when Japanese submarines and aircraft blitzed the
harbor's Battleship Row.
   ``We were just forward of the Arizona. We took a lot of heavy
hits, but counterflooded the ship so we sank slower and most of us
got out,'' he said. More than 100 of the ship's 1,500 crewmen were
lost.
   The Japanese struck all military installations on Oahu that day,
and smaller memorial services were held around the state.
   In Virginia, 800 members of the Pearl Harbor Survivors
Association gathered in Virginia Beach for a service that featured
military music, prayers and a flyover of Navy planes from nearby
Oceana Naval Air Station.
   In Oklahoma City, Admiral William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staffs, led fellow Oklahomans in a special tribute
to the 448 men who died aboard the USS Oklahoma during the attack.
About 300 people, many of them survivors and their families,
gathered under beside a war memorial near the state Capitol to
observe the anniversary.

<HEAD>No Bell-Ringing at Gorbachev on Wall Street</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 18th graf, `Soviet fashions...' with 2 grafs to UPDATE
with announcement of Gorbachev's early departure.</NOTE>

   Santa Claus got run out of Wall Street and was
not permitted to shake his bell at Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's motorcade.
   ``Three hours before the sirens screamed, the cops told me to
pick up my chimney and move it,'' grumbled John Davis, a sidewalk
Santa collecting for the Volunteers of America three blocks from his
usual location outside the New York York Stock Exchange.
   As Gorbachev's armor-plated Zil limousine rolled past the
cathedral of capitalism, the narrow sidewalks were jammed with
Yuppie types unable to cross police lines to get to their own
stretch limos.
   In Harry's Bar, where traders gather after the closing bell, the
Soviet tourist was jokingly dubbed the most famous Russian to shake
up Wall Street since Ivan Boesky, the junk bond tycoon indicted in
insider-trading scandals.
   From the observation deck of the World Trade Center, the Soviet
leader got to see New York on one of those rare smog-free late fall
evenings, with the setting sun gilding the windows of the
skyscrapers and a view for miles of the Jersey coast beyond the
green-garbed Statue of Liberty.
   But loud groans went up against glasnost in the waiting room of
the Staten Island ferry when service was delayed for security
reasons while Gorbachev, President Reagan and President-elect Bush
lingered over their lunch on Governors Island.
   Some passengers shook their fists at City Hall when the No. 6 bus
ended its runs there, a mile from the tip of Manhattan, because the
motorcade had pre-empted the rest of its route.
   ``The trouble with this country is that we should be spending
that million dollars on the homeless and not for police overtime to
protect this Gorbachev,'' shouted Meyer Gelman, who identified
himself as a Brooklyn lawyer.
   ``And the trouble with Gorbachev's country,'' the bus driver
joined the debate, ``is that you'd be put in jail for saying that.''
   Although severe gridlock developed late in the afternoon, many
commuters heeded warnings against bringing private cars to town. One
local TV station had cautioned its listeners in a singing commercial
to the tune of ``Santa Claus is Coming to Town'':
   ``Don't bring in your car,
   Stay off of the road,
   If you try to park,
   You're gonna get towed,
   Gorbachev is coming to town.''
   The Soviet leader's now-familiar snap-brim fedora made a big hit
with Murray Ingleman, a men's clothing factor in the Garment
District. ``It's right out of `The Untouchables,''' he said.
``Wouldn't it be great if this caught on and men's hats came back in
style?''
   While the Soviet motorcade moved through Times Square, leggy
Russian models in skimpy leather mini-skirts promenaded down a
runway at the Javits Convention Center, in practice session to
launch ``Style Wars.''
   Soviet fashions are part of a huge export exhibit of almost
everything from bicycles and computers to pianos and electric
samovars. Gorbachev was originally supposed to visit the exhibit
Thursday in hopes of helping rescue his country's flagging economy
with good old capitalist sales techniques.
   The visit was later canceled when it was announced the Soviet
leader would return home Thursday because of a devastating
earthquake in three southern Soviet republics.
   Smug New Yorkers who may think Soviet technology consists of
harvesting wheat with horse-drawn combines will be impressed with
the enormous earth-moving equipment and robotic machine tools on
display, along with luxury cut glass, advanced optics, Soyuz rockets
for rent to launch environment-studying satellites, and models of
nuclear-powered cargo sailing ships.
   Pretty girls wearing ``perestroika'' T-shirts are on hand to
explain these marvels in charming schoolgirl English. All this and
vodka, yet.

   Deer hunters found more than whitetails
in the woods this season: They ``bagged'' a murder suspect and found
a human skull, a crashing helicopter and a bazooka, officials say.
   ``We always seem to come up with lots of things during deer week
that we aren't really looking for,'' Allan McGroary, head of the
state's environmental police, said Wednesday as the 10-day shotgun
deer season ended.
   The season began Nov. 28. On the second day, a hunter in
northwest Massachusetts found the body of Mark Branch, the suspect
in the killing of Greenfield Community College student Sharon
Gregory, hanging in a tree a few miles from where his car was found
abandoned Oct. 25, said Greenfield Police Chief David McCarthy.
   ``I was only surprised they didn't find it opening day,''
McCarthy said. ``That area was just saturated with hunters.''
   He said authorities had searched for Branch's body, ``but we just
didn't have the manpower.''
   The helicopter, which otherwise might have taken hours or days to
locate, went down Friday over a Boy Scout camp in an isolated
section of Russell in southwest Massachusetts, killing the pilot, as
four stunned hunters dived for cover.
   The skull was turned up by a hunter in the Beartown State Forest
in Great Barrington in the state's southwest corner. Judging from
its size, the skull was believed to be that of a woman or a child,
police Officer Nancy Porter said today, adding that tests on the
skull were still being conducted.
   The bazooka, which police described as a one-shot disposable
model apparently abandoned by Army Reserve or National Guard troops
on summer maneuvers, was bagged in the nearby October Mountain State
Forest.

<HEAD>``The Mousetrap'' Snares Another Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Mousetrap,'' the world's longest-running
play, goes on... and on... and on....
   Agatha Christie's thriller has its 15,000th performance on
Friday. However, producer Sir Peter Saunders has become inured to
such milestones. ``Records are meaningless now, aren't they?'' he
says.
   The play, which marked its 36th birthday on Nov. 25, has
outlasted nine U.S. presidents and eight British prime ministers to
become as much a part of London life as Big Ben.
   It originally cost 5,000 pounds (then about $20,000) to stage
``Mousetrap'' when it opened at the Ambassadors Theater on Nov. 25,
1952. It since has moved next door to the St. Martin's Theater, and
has grossed over 14 million pounds ($25.6 million) with its story of
murderous intrigue on a stormy night at a deserted country manor.
   Since its premiere, 230 actors have appeared in the play, 66
miles of shirts have been ironed and 7.5 million people have seen
it, consuming 269 tons of ice cream and about 48,000 gallons of
beverages during intermissions.
   It started out with Richard Attenborough playing Det. Sgt.
Trotter. The famed actor-filmmaker has gone on to become the Academy
Award-winning director of ``Gandhi,'' ``A Chorus Line'' and ``Cry
Freedom.''
   Saunders, 77, said he remains mystified by the play's success.
   ``How it got to be the longest-running play is a question I can't
answer,'' said Saunders, who has produced many other Christie plays,
all far less durable.
   However, he acknowledged that the play's momentum is related less
to the theater than to being a British mainstay.
   ``If you go to Paris, you have to go see the Louvre once, even if
you hate pictures. The same applies to `The Mousetrap,''' he said.
   The cast is annually changed to keep the play fresh, and its 18th
director, Kim Grant, took over on Nov. 28.
   Saunders advises directors against excessive tampering. ``This
play is like a famous Dundee cake which has the same recipe for 100
years. You may change the way it's cooked, but you don't change the
ingredients.''
   Grant, who directed a 1983 revival of Noel Coward's ``Hay
Fever,'' has two weeks to rehearse his ``Mousetrap'' cast, as
opposed to the usual West End (London's Broadway) minimum of four.
He said the material was ``deceptively difficult.''
   ``To make it all plausible and realistic is a great challenge,''
he said. ``Christie's plays are actually very difficult to act,
partly because the dialogue is dated in a way.''
   The play has been presented in 24 different languages in 44
countries, including a six-month off-Broadway run in the early
1950s. Saunders sold the film rights to Romulus Films in 1956 with
the stipulation that no movie version appear until six months after
the the conclusion of the London run. He has twice offered to buy
back the rights, but to no avail.
   The producer also has vetoed any Broadway runs.
   ``The American press would crucify it,'' he said. ``Besides, I
want people to come over here to see it.''

   Here is an unofficial transcript of the statement
by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Wednesday night
announcing that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would cut
short his visit to the United States. The statement was delivered
through a translator during a news conference at the Soviet Mission
to the United Nations.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I've been instructed by Mikhail Gorbachev to report to you that
the Soviet Transcaucasian republics has suffered an extremely severe
earthquake with very grave consequences.
   Preliminary data indicate that in the Armenian republic,
thousands of people have died and of course I cannot give you a more
accurate figure for obvious reasons, there being also a lot of
disruption. It's a most grave misfortune, it's a terrible tragedy
not only for the Armenian people, but for all the peoples of the
Soviet Union.
   A special government-level commission has been set up, headed by
the chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union,
Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   Despite the fact that all necessary measures are being taken to
overcome the extremely grave consequences of this disaster. Mikhail
Gorbachev believes that when a people is suffering he has to be
there and he has to lead the effort, he has himself to lead the
efforts, these very important efforts himself.
   For that reason we have to cut short this visit and tomorrow we
will be returning home.
   Events scheduled for the general secretary are being canceled
with the exception of the opening ceremony of the Soviet trade
exhibition, which will be held at a different level.
   As for the visits to Cuba and Great Britain, they will take place
later at a time appropriate for such visits.
   In conclusion, let me on behalf of our delegation and on behalf
of Mikhail Gorbachev himself who asked me to say this, to convey to
you our very profound gratitude to all New Yorkers who have been in
these 36 hours extremely hospitable, very friendly, extremely warm
to our delegation, I would like also to extend our gratitude to the
authorities of the City of New York and to the United States
administration.
   This is all I have to report to you.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will cut short his
visit to the United States to return to Moscow because of a
devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in three
southern Soviet republics, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
said Wednesday.
   Shevardnadze called a surprise news conference late Wednesday
night and announced that Gorbachev was to depart prematurely
sometime early Thursday.
   ``Despite the fact that all emergency measures are being taken
... Mr. Gorbachev believes when the people are suffering he has to
be there, he has to lead the efforts,'' Shevardnadze said through an
official interpreter.
   The Soviet foreign minister said the earthquake Wednesday hit
Armenia, Azerbaijan and his native Georgia in the Caucasus region
south of Moscow. Shevardnadze said the epicenter was near the
Armenian town of Leninakan, and the quake registered 8.0, although
it was not clear whether he was referring to the Richter scale of
ground motion or a different Soviet system of calibration.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., said the quake
registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.
   A 7 reading on the Richter scale is a ``major'' earthquake,
capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable
of tremendous damage.
   ``I understand that Turkey, too, has been affected, but I don't
have any information,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Shevardnadze said Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov had flown to the
Armenian capital of Yerevan to take charge of emergency relief
operations.
   Gorbachev had been scheduled to travel to Cuba on Friday and on
to London Monday before returning to Moscow.
   The Soviet foreign minister said Gorbachev would depart early
Thursday. As for the visit to Britain and Cuba, they will take place
later, but at an appropriate time, Shevardnadze said.
   ``It's a terrible tragedy not only for the Armenian people but
for all the Soviet people,'' Shevardnadze said. He said the quake
had killed thousands of people, but more accurate figures were not
yet available.
   Initial word of the sudden change in plans from an official in
the president's entourage who refused to be quoted by name came only
hours after the top Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady I.
Gerasimov, told reporters Gorbachev would not abbreviate his visit
due to the earthquake.
   Ambassador Yuri Dubinin called White House national security
adviser Lt. Gen. Colin Powell at about 11:30 p.m. to tell him that
Gorbachev was going home early because of the quake, said
presidential spokesman B.J. Cooper.
   Shevardnadze said that President Reagan and President-elect
George Bush had expressed their condolences during the lunch meeting
with Gorbachev at Governors Island in New York Harbor, before the
extent of the catastrophe became clear to the Soviet delegation.
   Reports from the Soviet Union indicated the earthquake caused
severe damage and loss of life in the Caucasus, although it
reportedly did not do major damage in Yerevan.
   Armenia and the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan also have been
troubled recently by racial strife, leading to the virtual
declaration of martial law in that region.

<HEAD>Airline On-Time Record Improves Despite Chicago Lag</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Air traffic control problems increased delays
in the busy Chicago area but overall the nation's major airlines
reported that better than four in five flights arrived on time
during October, the Transportation Department says.
   The 13 largest domestic air carriers reported 83.4 percent of
their flights arrived within 15 minutes of the scheduled times _ the
margin considered on time by the government. It was the seventh
straight month the on-time record averaged over 80 percent.
   Eastern Airlines, which early this year was consistently among
the worst on-time performers, compiled the best record in October,
with Eastern planes arriving on or close to schedule 90.3 percent of
the time during the month.
   Eastern was followed by America West, 89.1 percent, and Delta Air
Lines, 87.8 percent. Alaska Airlines had the worst record at 77.9
percent. USAir and United Airlines, which has a concentration of
flights at Chicago, was barely ahead with a 79.7 percent on-time
mark.
   Meanwhile, the Transportation Department continued to receive
fewer complaints about air travel.
   The department reported that 1,196 air traveler complaints were
received by its consumer affairs office during November, fewer than
the month before and down 60 percent from the number received in
November l987. Trans World Airlines had the highest rate of
complaints with 8.12 per 100,000 passengers flown.
   The consumer complaints are released with the on-time statistics,
although they cover different months.
   Nearly one in four flights into Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport was delayed during October, ranking the airport 26th among
the 27 airports on which information was provided. In September,
O'Hare's on-time rate had been 81.6 percent.
   The Federal Aviation Administration reduced the number of flights
it would allow into Chicago's airports, including O'Hare, from 96 an
hour to 80 an hour on Oct. 3 because of concern that air traffic
controllers were being forced to handle too much traffic.
Controllers had made an unusually high number of traffic control
errors, prompting the FAA action.
   Salt Lake City had the best arrival record in October with 89.6
percent of the flights landing on time. San Francisco had the worst
record with 62.1 percent of the planes arriving on time, followed by
O'Hare.
   Since April, better than 80 percent of airline flights have been
arriving on time, compared to an average of about 74 percent during
the prior six months.
   Airlines no longer bunch flights together during peak travel
periods as much as they once did and often provide more flying time
in their posted flight schedules so the schedule more closely
reflects actual flying conditions, officials suggested.
   According to the monthly Transportation Department consumer
report, the number of complaints about mishandled bags increased in
October to 6.09 per 1,000 passengers, compared with 5.71 per 1,000
passengers in September.
   Southwest Airlines had the largest percentage of flights that
were late 70 percent of the time. Twenty-one Southwest flights, or
2.4 percent of the airline's total, were late at least seven out of
10 times during October. Overall, however, Southwest had the sixth
best on-time record with an 82.8 percent mark.

<HEAD>Legislators Offer Cautious Praise For Gorbachev's Troop-Cut Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legislators praised Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's announcement of a unilateral troop cut but said they
want to see the words backed up with action and renewed East-West
talks to reduce troop levels in Europe.
   With Congress out of session, few legislators were in the Capitol
and most reacted cautiously, saying they wanted to see more details
of how the Soviets will carry out the plan made public Wednesday by
Gorbachev at the United Nations.
   They also noted that the Soviets now have a large numerical edge
in troops and various categories of weapons in Europe.
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, the incoming Senate majority
leader, said he welcomed Gorbachev's statement but added, ``while
these proposals are commendable, they must be considered in view of
overall levels of forces in Europe and the offensive structure of
Soviet forces.''
   Mitchell said he hopes the announcement will lead to ``the
reinvigoration'' of long-stalled efforts to negotiate cuts in
military strength in Europe.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, called the speech ``certainly
the most positive signal from Moscow in 70 years, much more positive
because words at last are being accompanied by deeds.''
   ``We must not abandon caution, but neither should we slam the
door in the face of opportunity,'' Wright said in a statement.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said, ``Mr. Gorbachev
has promised a lot, but can he deliver? Only his actions _ not just
words _ will tell the world whether his U.N. speech becomes a
one-of-a-kind Christmas gift or just another stocking stuffer.
   ``If we really see such cutbacks in Eastern Europe, then we might
indeed be seeing a good-faith first step toward real conventional
force parity; our negotiators in Vienna will be insisting on no
less,'' said Dole.
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., a member of the Armed Services
Committee, said, ``we need to bear in mind that we in the West have
heard about a number of interesting proposals from Gorbachev and
other top Soviet officials.
   ``But what we haven't seen is any real change in Soviet military
forces,'' said Wirth. ``What we have seen is largely improvements in
Soviet forces.''
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, was the most euphoric.
   ``Gorbachev's speech could be the end of the Cold War, the end of
the arms race (and) the end of the danger of nuclear war,'' he said.
``Of course, we need deeds, not words. We have to see what the
Soviets actually do.''
   The top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen.
John Warner, R-Va., said, ``I would urge a note of caution.''
   Even if the Soviets go ahead with the promised 10 percent troop
reduction, Warner said, they will have ``two and one-half times as
many tanks, three and one-half times as many artillery pieces.''
   ``It's too early to tell exactly the impact of these dramatic
announcements,'' he said. They may simply eliminate older, less
capable weapons. ``The Soviet Union has quite a collection of
antiquated military equipment.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said Gorbachev has ``done more than anyone thought he
could do politically. ``His cuts are dramatic and significant _
especially that he will make them unilaterally.''
   But Aspin warned: ``Don't be distracted by all the dramatic
numbers you're hearing. We don't fight wars by the numbers.''
   Gorbachev promised to reorganize the Soviet military, Aspin
noted, explaining that ``a reorganization that removes the Soviet
offensive capability declaws the Russian bear and is far more
important than numbers on a chart.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, called Gorbachev's statements ``profoundly
welcome.''
   ``If the Soviet government follows through on Gorbachev's pledge,
this will challenge the United States and its allies to act
imaginatively to start a similar process of arms reduction,'' said
Pell.
   Pell said the administration should ``take advantage of the
openings created by Gorbachev's speech to accelerate the momentum of
arms control negotiations on conventional, as well as nuclear,
weapons.''

   The strongest earthquake to hit the Soviet Caucasus
in 80 years devastated the region on Wednesday, and officials said
thousands of people were killed as buildings collapsed in a wide
area.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cut short his summit trip to New
York and planned to return to Moscow on Thursday because of the
quake, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told a news
conference in New York.
   Gorbachev, who had been scheduled to visit Cuba and London before
returning home, called the earthquake ``a grave tragedy.'' The U.S.
Geological Survey said it registered 6.9 on the Richter schale.
   Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the earthquake hit Armenia,
Azerbaijan and his native Georgia far south of Moscow, near the
border with Iran and Turkey. He said the epicenter was near the
Armenian town of Leninakan, a city of 200,000 people that media
reports say was badly damaged.
   The foreign minister said Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov had flown to
the Armenian capital of Yerevan to take charge of relief operations.
   An Armenian Interior Ministry statement early Thursday on Yerevan
Radio said cars, apparently carrying residents from stricken towns,
were causing congestion on roads linking Yerevan with Leninakan and
Kirovakan and hampering relief efforts.
   ``As a result of the earthquake, a grave situation has arisen in
the republic,'' the statement said.
   Armenia was the hardest-hit area in the Caucasus.
   ``Preliminary data indicate that in the Armenian republic,
thousands of people have died, and of course I cannot give you a
more accurate figure for obvious reasons, there being also a lot of
disruption,'' Shevardnadze said.
   ``It's a most grave misfortune, it's a terrible tragedy not only
for the Armenian people, but for all the peoples of the Soviet
Union,'' he added.
   ``Despite the fact that all emergency measures are being taken
... Mr. Gorbachev believes when the people are suffering he has to
be there, he has to lead the efforts,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Armenia and the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan have been
wracked by ethnic strife, leading to the virtual declaration of
martial law in the region.
   A scientist at the seismic station in Yerevan said he visited the
disaster area and estimated the death toll probably would run into
the thousands. He declined to give his name.
   Gennady Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in New
York, ``A small village has practically disappeared from the face of
the earth.'' But he did not identify it.
   The quake killed at least four people and caused extensive damage
in eastern Turkey, authorities said.
   The Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., said the quake, centered
south of the Georgian capital of Tblisi, occurred at 11:41 a.m.
(2:41 a.m. EST) and registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. A quake of
that magnitude is capable of causing widespread, heavy damage.
   The temblor, followed by a moderate aftershock measuring 5.8 on
the Richter scale, struck a mountain region in the Soviet Union
already wracked by months of ethnic violence between Armenians and
Azerbaijanis.
   State-run television, in an unusually prompt and detailed report
from the scene, showed film of crumbled buildings in Kirovakan,
Armenia's third-largest city, and in Spitak, a regional center of
Armenia.
   Workers were shown picking up huge slabs of concrete amid the
rubble. In one dramatic shot, a man put his hands over his head in
grief as he stood amid a collapsed building.
   ``The spontaneous elements didn't spare one-story or multistory
building,'' a TV correspondent said on the evening broadcast.
   The correspondent said thousands were homeless and that ``there
are casualties, injured,'' but neither he nor Soviet news reports
gave figures.
   ``In several regions of Armenia there is significant damage,
deaths and injuries,'' Tass said.
   Officials said communications had been cut off with Leninakan,
near where the quake was centered, and with much of the disaster
area. Leninakan is 100 miles northwest of Yerevan and close to the
Soviet-Turkish border.
   They said the loss of communications complicated efforts to
assess the damage and casualties.
   The government set up a commission to oversee rescue and salvage
operations and sent soldiers and civilian volunteers to the disaster
area, Tass said.
   State Turkish radio quoted the Kars provincial governor, Hasan
Fakir, as saying four residents of the town of Akyaka were killed in
the quake. Many houses were damaged in Akyaka and in the nearby
Cildir township, it said.
   Tass said the quake reached 9 on the 12-point Soviet scale, which
measures tremors on the basis of their visible effects. An
earthquake of 8 on the Soviet scale is described in Soviet reference
works as ``destructive,'' causing ``cracks on sharp slopes and in
wet soils. Monuments are moved or turned over. Houses are
considerably damaged.''
   The Moscow Central Seismic Center put the epicenter 30 miles from
Leninakan.
   Because of violence between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, more than
180,000 refugees reportedly have fled across the border between
their two republics in the past three weeks. The earthquake was
likely to cause further dislocation.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.

<HEAD>Government Fines 29 Airlines For Lapses In Airport Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security at airport passenger checkpoints is
improving, but the government has found enough lapses to levy $1.6
million in fines against 29 airlines.
   The Federal Aviation Administration announced the civil penalties
Tuesday and also said the detection rate for hidden weapons at the
checkpoints has improved significantly during the past year.
   The civil penalties ranged from $1,000 against a handful of
commuter carriers _ the minimum for a single violation _ to more
than $200,000 apiece against American Airlines, Northwest Airlines
and United Airlines for each having more than two dozen violations.
   The airlines are responsible for the checkpoints, although the
screening by metal detectors and X-ray machines is normally done by
a separate security firm under contract to the air carriers using
the airport.
   The penalties stemmed from security lapses discovered mostly
between April and September of this year when undercover FAA
officials attempted to smuggle mock weapons through the checkpoints
and were successful 236 times, according to the agency.
   As part of a stepped up effort to improve passenger screening at
airports, the government began to levy fines against the airlines
earlier this year. In September, 32 airlines were fined about $1
million for security lapses in late 1987 and early 1988. Those fines
were separate from the penalties announced Wednesday.
   Shortcomings at the airport checkpoints came to light in 1987
when during congressional testimony it was learned that more than
one in five phony weapons planted by FAA officials failed to be
detected at major airports. Then on Dec. 7, 1987 a disgruntled USAir
employee smuggled a revolver aboard a Pacific Southwest Airlines jet
and began shooting during flight. The plane crashed, killing all 43
aboard.
   According to FAA figures, the airlines in 1987 detected only 78.9
percent of the mock weapons being passed through checkpoints by FAA
undercover agents. During the first six months of this year the
success rate increased to 85.6 percent and during the July-September
period it improved to 88.9 percent, the FAA said.
   But Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley told reporters Wednesday
he would like to see even fewer weapons missed and said the FAA
undercover work will continue.
   ``Although the detection rate has improved since last year, I
will not be satisfied until we achieve a 100 percent success rate in
detecting weapons,'' Burnley said.
   DOT spokesman Ed O'Hara said airlines were fined $1,000 for each
violation that occurred at a checkpoint where the overall detection
rate was 95 percent or better and $10,000 at a checkpoint where the
overall rate was less than 95 percent.
   In some cases a single violation resulted in several airlines
being fined because a number of air carriers shared responsibility
for a checkpoint. The FAA declined to provide a breakdown of the
detection rates at various airports or disclose how many airports or
which airports were checked.
   Four airlines were cited for at least two dozen violations:
United, 33 violations for $249,00 in fines; Northwest, 29 violations
for $209,000 in fines; American, 28 violations for $208,000 in
fines; and USAir, 26 violations for $179,000 in fines.
   Other airlines and their violations and fines were:
   Pan American World Airways, 19 and $154,000; Delta Air Lines, 17
and $116,000; Continental Airlines, 14 and $85,000; Eastern
Airlines, 11 and $65,000; Alaska Airlines, 10 and $64,000; Trans
World Airlines, 9 and $72,000; America West, 7 and $61,000;
   Piedmont Airlines, 5 and $32,000; Hawaiian Airlines, 5 and
$23,000; Midway, 4 and $31,000; Skywest, 2 and $20,000; Air Midwest,
Braniff and Great Lakes Airline, all 2 with $11,000 apiece; Aloha
Airlines, Atlantic SE Airline, Aviation Assoc. (Estern Metro),
Resort Air (Trans World Expess), and Wings West, all 1 violation and
$10,000 apiece; MarkAir, Pacific Southwest (since merged with
USAir), Reeve Aleutian, Simmons (American Eagle), Tennessee Airways
and Tower Air, each 1 violation and $1,000.

<HEAD>Study Says Infant Health Declined In Rural Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infant health problems in the nation's poorest
rural areas grew worse during the first half of the 1980s, reversing
the trend of the late 1970s, a consumer research group said.
   Public Voice for Food and Health Policy said Wednesday that its
analysis of infant health data from the nation's 332 poorest rural
counties found that the proportion of babies born at dangerously low
weight dropped from 9.1 percent to 8.3 percent between 1975 and
1980, then increased to 8.8 percent in 1985.
   The study said the rate of low birthweight babies in the 332
poorest counties _ those where at least one-fourth of the population
was below the federal poverty level _ was almost 30 percent higher
than in the nation as a whole.
   Low birthweight is a major cause of infant death and long-term
disability. The study said the infant mortality rate in the poor
counties was 13.6 per 1,000 live births in 1985, compared with a
rate of 10.6 nationally.
   If the infant mortality rate in the poor rural areas had been as
low as the national average during the decade, the study said, there
would have been between 4,000 and 6,400 fewer infant deaths in those
poor counties.
   ``This country has long had one of the highest infant mortality
rates among the world's industrialized nations,'' said Rep. Roy
Rowland, D-Ga., the only physician in Congress and the vice-chairman
of the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality.
   Rowland, whose district includes 13 of the 332 counties that were
part of the study, said infant health problems in rural areas have
been worsened by Reagan administration cuts in spending on health
care programs.
   He said the problem also stems from a decline in the number of
physicians in rural areas, a lack of transportation for pregnant
women requiring health care, and a failure to educate poor pregnant
women on the importance of prenatal care.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Christopher Cox won dismissal of a
libel claim in a $5 million lawsuit by Werner Erhard and Associates,
but slander allegations against the newly elected congressmen were
allowed to stand.
   Although the slander charges remain undecided as a result of the
judge's decision, attorneys for both sides claimed victory.
   The lawsuit filed in May stemmed from a campaign pamphlet that
criticized Cox' opponent Nathan Rosenberg for his ties to est, the
human-potential movement founded by his brother, Erhard.
   The pamphlet was sent to about 110,000 households before the June
7 Republican primary in which Cox defeated Rosenberg. It asked
voters to read a Los Angeles magazine article that said the
Chicago-based Cult Awareness Network has called est and other Erhard
programs ``destructive cults.''
   In a ruling released Tuesday, Orange County Court Commissioner
Eleanor Palk, who is overseeing the case, granted a request by Cox'
attorneys to dismiss the libel charge.
   Palk said the pamphlet was a constitutionally protected political
statement.
   However, she denied a request to dismiss charges that Cox
supporters posing as pollsters phoned voters and asked residents if
they could vote for a candidate tied to est.
   Erhard attorney William O'Hare said the ruling vindicated his
client. Cox attorney Sue Himmelrich also claimed victory.
   Cox, a former White House attorney for President Reagan, was
elected last month to represent the Orange County district.

<HEAD>Study Finds Churches Prime Source of Volunteers, Funds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Churches are gaining in numbers while providing
a vital source of charitable funds and volunteer activities,
according to a study that says religious congregations devote nearly
half the money they receive to charitable use.
   The study, ``From Belief to Commitment,'' says churches surpass
foundations and corporations as financial resources for charities.
   The study was done by Independent Sector, a Washington-based
group representing organizations involved in philanthropy and
voluntary activities. The Gallup Organization assisted in the study
released Wednesday.
   The survey yielded much information on churches and their
memberships in addition to the data on charitable activities.
   For example, 54 percent of congregations reported that their
memberships had increased over five years, compared with 18 percent
reporting a decrease. Thirty percent of congregations were founded
before 1900, 16 percent between 1900 and 1930, 25 percent between
1931 and 1970, and 15 percent since 1971, ``indicating the continued
vitality of religious institutions in the United States.''
   But the main aim of the study was to determine whether and how
much church-related giving could be counted as evidence of the
non-profit sector's service to society.
   The study found that $19.1 billion of the $41.4 billion
contributed in 1986 to congregations ``was used in ways that express
religious conviction about service to others.''
   In addition, volunteer activities by clergy and church members
were valued in the study at $13.1 billion. Some 253,000 volunteer
clergy gave an average of 70 hours per month, and 10.4 million
volunteers other than clergy worked an average of 10 hours per month
on congregational programs.
   The survey found that nearly nine out of 10 of the nation's
296,000 congregations had one or more programs in human services and
welfare, with a heavy focus on family counseling activities.
   Seventy percent were involved in overseas charitable activities,
and 56 percent were involved in institutional care such as
hospitals, nursing homes or hospices.
   ``This study makes clear how very large their community services
are, dwarfing all funds contributed to and by other voluntary
organizations for local human services,'' says a foreword to the
study. ``The report documents that religious congregations are the
primary voluntary service providers for neighborhoods.''
   The $19.1 billion given by congregations, mostly in the form of
collections and pledges, was in addition to the approximately $11
billion contributed by other sources to religiously affiliated
organizations such as schools, nursing homes and day care centers,
the group said.
   Of the $48.1 billion in total expenditures by congregations in
1986, $8.4 billion was donated directly to other organizations and
individuals, the study said. Of that, $5.5 billion went to
denominational organizations and charities, such as Catholic
Charities; $1.9 billion went to other charitable organizations in
the community; and $1 billion was given directly to individuals.
   ``This compares to the total of financial support from all U.S.
foundations in the same year of $5.9 billion and of U.S. business
corporations of $4.5 billion, making religions a primary source of
financial grants,'' Independent Sector said.
   On the makeup of church congregations, the study also found:
   _The bulk of congregations, 124,000, were medium-sized, having
100 to 399 members; the next-largest number, 103,000, were large,
with more than 400 members; and 60,000 were small, with fewer than
100 members. Not all reported their size.
   _Fourteen percent of congregations ranked themselves liberal, 26
percent moderate, 39 percent conservative and 18 percent very
conservative. Congregations founded before 1900 were equally as
likely to report their orientation as liberal to moderate as they
were to report their orientation as conservative or very
conservative. Of those founded since 1971, 69 percent reported their
orientation as conservative or very conservative.
   More than 100 denominations _ Protestant, Roman Catholic, Mormon,
Jewish, Muslim and others _ and all regions were represented in the
sample.
   The survey, conducted from May 1987 through March 1988, included
telephone interviews with 4,205 local congregations and more
detailed questionnaires given to a smaller sampling.
   Details on giving by individual congregations and denominations
were kept confidential.
   Independent Sector President Brian O'Connell said the study was
undertaken before the outbreak of scandals involving television
evangelists and was not intended to offset the negative publicity
they caused.

   United States marshals live in legend as the
men who tamed the Wild West, but their 200-year career is
intertwined with more of the country's history than just bringing
bandits to justice.
   The country's oldest law enforcement organization looks back at
its storied history today as it begins a bicentennial celebration
with the opening of an exhibit at the Supreme Court and a black-tie
gala at a nearby hotel.
   ``At almost every point in history when the federal government
was involved in a significant event, there were marshals
participating,'' says Stephen Boyle, a spokesman for the U.S.
Marshals Service.
   A marshal fired the gun that sent settlers scrambling for a
homestead in the Oklahoma land run of 1889; marshals guarded the
first black student at the University of Mississippi during the
desegregation battles of the 1960s; they ringed the Pentagon during
the Vietnam war protests of the early 1970s.
   They smashed whiskey stills during Prohibition and arrested
gangster Al Capone twice; took the census until 1880; captured
fugitive slaves before the Civil War and protected freed slaves
during Reconstruction; and did the hanging for ``Hanging Judge''
Isaac Parker in Fort Smith, Ark., when Oklahoma was still Indian
Territory and bank and train robbers hid in the brush.
   ``This is our heritage, the preservation of history,'' said Clint
Peoples of Waco, Texas. Peoples is the executive marshal for the
bicentennial, and served as a marshal for 15 years in North Texas
and as chief of the Texas Rangers.
   Sponsored by the United States Marshals Foundation, a non-profit
fund-raising organization, the special guest at tonight's event will
be James Arness, who played Marshal Matt Dillon on television's
``Gunsmoke'' for 20 years. One of those being honored is Deputy
Marshal Rey F. Cestero of Savannah, Ga., for his assistance in
apprehending two murder and abduction suspects in August.
   Included in the exhibit, organized with the help of the
Smithsonian Institution, are the arrest warrant for Geronimo, an
1870 Ku Klux Klan robe from the Klan's birthplace of Pulaski, Tenn.,
a 1790 still from the Whiskey Rebellion era, and one of the two
machine guns from the St. Valentine's Day massacre in Chicago _ the
bloodiest of Prohibition.
   The exhibit, which will tour a dozen cities over the next 2{
years, also includes a Jesse James vest and sidearm, and original
drawings by the legendary Wyatt Earp of four gunfights including one
at the OK Corral.
   During their first 100 years, marshals ``were the federal
government at the local level,'' says marshals historian Frederick
S. Calhoun. ``There was no infrastructure of a bureaucracy, so when
the citizens got mad, they took it out on the federal marshals.''
   Partly as a result, at least 400 and as many as 700 people in the
Marshals Service died in the line of duty, more casualties than in
any other law enforcement agency, officials say. The reason they
lack specific numbers is that officials are unsure whether all those
who died had been deputized or were simply parts of posses and that
``makes it very fuzzy,'' said Stanley Morris, director of the
Marshals Service.
   Appointed by the president, the 94 U.S. marshals are a part of
the executive branch, created by the first Congress in the Judiciary
Act of 1789 _ the same law that established the federal judicial
system.
   The marshals of the 1980s provide security in federal courts, and
protect Supreme Court justices when they travel beyond Washington.
They track down federal fugitives and operate the witness protection
program that gives new identities to those whose lives are
jeopardized by testifying for the government.
   They also are responsible for property seized in the war on drugs
and other federal offenses, and currently have three-quarters of a
billion dollars in their inventory, Boyle said. Marshals have
managed horse ranches, restaurants, condominiums, a golf course and
a greenhouse taken in such raids.
   With just the 94 marshals, aided by some 2,000 deputies and about
1,000 support staff, the service is smaller than the New York City
Police Department, Morris said, yet its ranks are spread across
every U.S. judicial district from Guam to the Virgin Islands.
   Calhoun, who has a doctorate in history from the University of
Chicago, says the deadliest era in the service's history was before
Oklahoma statehood, when about 100 marshals died in Indian territory
between 1872 and 1896.
   ``With the exception of Indian Territory, the far most dangerous
time to be a marshal was in the South after the Civil War,'' Calhoun
said. ``If the Ku Klux Klan didn't get you, the moonshiners did.''

<HEAD>Not All Delinquent Loan Notices Were on Target, USDA Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Some of the 83,480 loan delinquencies targeted
last month for official collection already had been settled by the
time notices were sent out, the Farmers Home Administration says.
   Moreover, many state FmHA offices have been reporting far fewer
delinquencies than the Agriculture Department agency listed on Nov.
25 when it finished sending out the notices.
   Agency spokesman Joe O'Neill said the 83,480 loan delinquencies
reported last month represented ``everybody who owed money'' and
were behind in their payments to FmHA.
   In all, more than $8 billion in overdue loans is involved. The
notices give a delinquent borrower 45 days to fill out forms showing
how the debt will be settled.
   O'Neill said in an interview that lists of 83,490 delinquent
loans were sent to county FmHA offices so local officials could weed
out those who had already made arrangements to settle their debt, or
for some other reason were not slated to get the notices.
   As a result, several thousand borrowers were pared from the
tally, he said. Those remaining were sent notices by certified mail
over a 10-day period beginning Nov. 15.
   ``No, indeed, we did not sent out that many,'' O'Neill said.
``It's probably closer to 80,000, somewhere in there.''
   Congress ordered FmHA in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 to
revise its lending practices and to come up with ways of handling
long-overdue debt owed by thousands of farmers. One of the important
features is a debt write-down or foregiveness provision, which took
effect last month.
   The purpose of the notices is to give tardy payers an opportunity
to let FmHA know how they want to handle their debt under the new
law. If a farmer does not respond within the 45-day period after
receiving the notice, the agency can begin collection proceedings,
including foreclosure and forced liquidation.
   O'Neill said another point of misunderstanding is the manner in
which local FmHA offices have been carrying some of the borrowers on
agency books. For example, he said, some offices may not be
including those whose overdue accounts have been ``accelerated,'' or
put into the foreclosure or forced-sale pipeline.
   The 1987 law also changed the definition of a borrower to include
anyone who owes FmHA money. So all those past-due loans in
acceleration _ and even those where the borrower is no longer
farming _ are included in the list of delinquencies.
   ``Anytime you start playing with numbers, it's difficult at
best,'' O'Neill said.

   Nearly 600 farms that have been in the same
families for 200 years have been located, and more are expected to
be found, the Agriculture Department says.
   The department's effort to identify National Bicentennial Farms
was undertaken last year as part of the 200th anniversary of the
signing of the U.S. Constitution.
   Assistant Secretary Wilmer D. Mizell said the farms located so
far are in 16 states, mostly along the East Coast. The program was
led by state Food and Agriculture Councils, which are made up of
USDA officials at the state level.
   Each of the farms located has been given a certificate signed by
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng ``to acknowledge the vital
contribution of farm families to the growth and strength of this
great nation.''
   Also, the families have been given metal signs to display in
front of their homes, identifying them in red, white and blue as
bicentennial farms.
   Mizell said Wednesday that a total of about 700 farms is expected
to be located. Families wishing to submit applications may contact
state and local USDA and extension offices for more information.
   The oldest farm discovered dates back to 1632 when apprentice
barrelmaker John Tuttle survived a shipwreck off the coast of Maine
and found his way to Dover, Conn., to claim 15 acres granted him by
Charles I, then king of England.
   His decendant, Hugh Tuttle, and Hugh's three children still own
the farm, an enterprise that includes a roadside store.
   As of Nov. 1, bicentennial farms identified by state included:
Connecticut, 36; Delaware, 16; Georgia, 24; Louisiana, two;
Maryland, 33; Maine, 30; Massachusetts, 39; New Hampshire, 47; New
Jersey, 17; New York, 17; North Carolina, 31; Pennsylvania, 95;
Rhode Island, 10; South Carolina, 88; Virginia, about 50; and West
Virginia, 38.

   About $106 million is going out to states as
their final share of national forest sales receipts this year, the
Agriculture Department said.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said Wednesday the money is in
addition to a preliminary payment of $212 million which went to
states on Sept. 27, bringing the total for the fiscal year that
ended Sept. 30 to more than $318 million.
   By law, 25 percent of the revenues collected by the Agriculture
Department agency for the sale of timber and other use of national
forest resources must be returned to the states where the forests
are located. Actual receipts in fiscal 1988 totaled approximately
$1.26 billion.
   The states are required to use the funds for schools and roads.

   The House ethics committee is unlikely to
conclude its investigation of Speaker Jim Wright until early next
year, members of the panel say.
   While most witnesses relevant to the case have been interviewed,
the special counsel handling the case, Richard J. Phelan, still has
not written a final report, the lawmakers said after a 30-minute
status session Wednesday.
   ``It will be next year'' before the case is wrapped up, said Rep.
Thomas Petri, R-Wis. ``We've still got some loose ends to tie up.''
   Asked whether the investigation will extend into 1989, Rep. John
T. Myers, R-Ind., replied: ``I think you can make book on that.''
   Myers said the six GOP members of the 12-member committee all
were reappointed Wednesday to new terms to provide continuity at
least until the Wright inquiry is completed.
   No committee members would comment on results of the
investigation thus far. The panel could dismiss the charges or it
could issue a statement of alleged violations, the congressional
equivalent of an indictment. That would trigger a disciplinary
hearing and possible sanctions.
   Wright, D-Texas, has been under investigation since June on
allegations he improperly used his office for financial gain and
wrongly used his position to lobby federal officials on behalf of
Texious situations in which an
investigation has been incomplete at the end of a Congress, members
have continued on the panel to provide continuity.
   ``I would assume there would be continuity,'' said one of the
Democrats, Rep. Vic Fazio of California.

<HEAD>Panel Told Of Security Lapses At Strategic Oil Reserve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is doing a poor job protecting
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the nation's main defense against a
sudden cutoff of foreign oil supplies, from possible sabotage or
terrorist attack, a House panel was told.
   ``Improvements are needed in the security program,'' Keith Fultz
of the congressional General Accounting Office told the House
Government Operations subcommittee on environment, energy and
natural resources on Wednesday.
   ``There are vulnerabilities that exist,'' said Joe La Grone, an
Energy Department official responsible for the strategic oil reserve.
   The reserve, created by Congress in 1975 in response to the 1973
Arab oil embargo, currently holds 550 million barrels of oil in
caverns in Texas and Louisiana.
   The House panel also heard details of a mock attack on the oil
reserve in March 1987 by 11 Army Special Forces troops to test
security at the facility, which includes 240 miles of pipelines and
extensive support facilities such as power substations.
   In the mock attack, the invaders successfully knocked out the
support facilities that are vital to pumping and transporting the
stockpiled petroleum in an emergency. They also recorded 53 mock
casualties among the reserve's defenders, including 12 national
guardsmen mistakenly killed by local sheriff's deputies.
   La Grone said officials have taken steps to improve security at
the $18 billion reserve, including more defense forces and a better
communications network so defenders can avoid shooting each other.
   Fultz said that although the department has made some
improvements in security, ``we're not convinced the SPR could meet
drawdown requirements if certain circumstances occur.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Fultz and La Grone said the sheer size of the petroleum reserve _
including six depots and four marine terminals _ makes it
impractical to try to protect every foot of it against sabateurs.
   The Energy Department's defense plan envisions an attack at only
one point, compared with the four facilities hit simultaneously by
the mock invaders. Officials said, however, that there have been no
new multi-point attack tests since last year's.
   Officials said their approach is to concentrate on key sites and
to quickly repair any damage and get the emergency oil supplies
flowing after an attack. But they conceded their repair plans have
never been tested.
   Fultz said the Energy Department has only one contractor to
repair the 240 miles of pipeline _ a situation leaving the
contractor's equipment and spare parts vulnerable to sabotage. La
Grone said a second contractor will soon be hired.
   A detailed General Accounting Office study of the reserve's
security contained a series of recommendations for improvement, but
the study has been classified ``secret'' by the Energy Department.
   La Grone said ``those areas that need fixing, that need upgrading
_ they will get that.''
   After a closed-door session following the public hearing,
subcommittee chairman Mike Synar, D-Okla., said department officials
had agreed to implement some of the specific recommendations made by
GAO and to rethink their assumption that an attack would involve
only one site.
   ``I'm pleased that the department has finally acknowledged the
seriousness of the security problems,'' Synar said. ``All of the oil
in the world won't do you any good if you can't get it out of the
ground and to where you need it.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aide to President-elect George Bush says the
new administration would use an international environmental
conference to push for global cuts in carbon dioxide emissions and a
ban on ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbon chemicals.
   The aide, Bob Grady, told a luncheon Wednesday at the Climate
Institute that the Bush administration also would advocate growing
more forests and clearing fewer of them.
   The Climate Institue is a non-profit group trying to call
attention to environmental threats from climate changes.
   Bush pledged during the presidential campaign to convene an
international conference on the ``greenhouse effect'' causing global
warming and said he would bring a ``conservation ethic'' to the
White House.
   He was not specific, though, on what results should come from a
conference on the greenhouse effect. He said only that it should
``develop a strategy for tackling this global problem.''
   ``His experience is that international cooperation is indeed
possible in these matters,'' said Grady.
   ``I sincerely believe George Bush will use his foreign policy
experience, informed by the conservation ethic, to work toward
global consensus.
   ``The agenda is clear ... We must work together to reduce the
emissions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.
   ``We must plan to phase out CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) that
destroy stratospheric ozone. We must stem the alarming net loss of
forests around the world.''
   Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is the principal gas
whose buildup in the atmosphere trapping the earth's heat is blamed
by many scientists for the warming trend.
   CFCs, which contribute importantly to the warming, already are
the subject of an international agreement to reduce production by 50
percent by 1998 because they destroy the high-altitude layer of
ozone that protects the Earth's surface from the ultraviolet rays of
the sun.
   These chemicals are used abroad for aerosol propellants and
everywhere for solvents, refrigeration fluids and plastic foam
production.
   Forest clearing, in addition to other harm such as removal of
wildlife habitat, releases carbon tied up in plant tissue which
becomes carbon dioxide when burned. A growing forest, however,
removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
   Brazilian forest burning to create farmland has been estimated to
account for 10 percent of the 5.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide
that reaches the atmosphere every year.

   The U.S. dollar rose moderately Thursday against the
Japanese yen, while share prices plunged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which surpassed
the 30,000-point mark Wednesday for the first time by gaining 381.44
points, plunged 291.92 points or 0.97 percent to finish trading at
29,758.90.
   The dollar closed at 123.02 yen, up 0.59 yen from Wednesday's
close of 122.43 yen. Opening at 123.40 yen, the currency moved in a
range of 122.85-123.48 yen.
   Currency traders said the dollar's rise followed sharp gains
overnight in overseas markets following Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's announcement at the United Nations that his country
would cut its troop strength by 500,000 and reduce the number of its
conventional arms.
   ``The market took the Soviet move as a helping hand for the
United States toward cutting its huge fiscal deficits'' by easing
U.S. defense obligations, said a currency dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Meanwhile, on the stock exchange, investors sold shares in a
round of profit-taking following Wednesday's landmark rise.
   ``Market players seemed to be reacting to Wednesday's sharp
upsurge,'' said an analyst at Daiwa Securities.

<HEAD>Whitehead Cites Loosening of `KGB Mentality' in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Worldwide acceptance of basic human rights
standards has loosened the grip of a ``KGB mentality'' in the Soviet
Union and made totalitarian terror unacceptably costly to most world
leaders, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said today.
   Whitehead, commenting at State Department ceremonies marking the
40th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, said there has been significant human rights progress
not only in the Soviet Union but in such Eastern European nations as
Poland and Hungary.
   ``Thousands have been allowed to emigrate, hundreds of political
prisoners have been freed, and we have seen some loosening of
controls on religious worship,'' Whitehead said.
   He also said ``state security'' has become less a subject for
official paranoia.
   ``Open discussion of important issues has become more widespread
throughout the Soviet Union,'' Whitehead said. ``I say, let it
continue and grow.''
   But he said there has been no forward movement on human rights in
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria or East Germany and said that in Romania,
``we are witnessing a regression.''
   Whitehead also complained that in the Soviet Union, ``millions of
Eastern Rite Catholics remain unable to practice their religion
officially.''
   ``Much change will have to occur before we can say that the
average Soviet citizen no longer fears his government, that the rule
of law has been established and that the arbitrary use of power by
Soviet officialdom has ended,'' Whitehead said.
   ``Still, who would have thought eight years ago that the Soviet
Union would be so changed,'' he said.
   ``Leadership changes in the Soviet Union brought a loosening of
the grip of what I would call the KGB mentality,'' Whitehead said.
``Many of the leaders of the Soviet Union began to take a more
practical view of the world.''
   He said there are a number of reasons for these developments. One
is the fact that ``the growth of acceptance for universal standards
of civil and political rights has today made that old standby,
totalitarian terror and oppression, unacceptably costly in the eyes
of most leaders.''
   Whitehead said the United States can't claim credit for the
changes taking place inside the Soviet Union, ``but we can claim
credit for having capitalized on the opening we found, and pushed
hard to accelerate the rate of change.''
   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the
United Nations on Dec. 10, 1948. The actual 40th anniversary falls
on Saturday but is being commemorated in the United States today.
   The declaration contains many of the civil rights laid out in the
first 10 amendments to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
   It also includes the right to leave and return to the country of
one's origin, and the right to send and receive information from any
source across international borders.
   It also calls for a limit to the power of a government to coerce
individual citizens against their will and such affirmative rights
as the right to an education, the right to work at the occupation of
one's choosing and the right to own property.

<HEAD>`Toxic Sock Syndrome' and `Runner's Rump' Plague Athletes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sports medicine expert says ailments such as
``black heel,'' ``bikini bottom,'' ``jogger's nipples'' and ``toxic
sock syndrome'' bother athletes and fitness fans more often than
broken bones or strained muscles.
   Skin injuries such as these are among the most common of locker
room complaints, says medical professor Rodney S. W. Basler, whose
list of athletic ailments also includes ``runner's rump'' and
``surfer's nodules.''
   The skin ``bears the brunt of the punishment'' from exercise and
develops injuries in unexpected ways, Basler said Wednesday in an
interview at the annual meeting of the American Academy of
Dermatology.
   ``The percentage of people in fitness conditioning or good
athletic programs who develop some types of skin problems is quite
large. I wouldn't be surprised if three-quarters or four-fifths of
everybody in a fitness program has some type of skin injury,'' said
Basler, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska Medical
Center and a fitness medicine expert.
   Most of the skin injuries will go away when the exercise is
halted, he said, but the ailments can cause irritation, pain and
cosmetic concern.
   Joggers and marathoners, whose skin must endure hours of
punishment, are heir to a number of dermatological problems ranging
from black heel to runner's rump.
   Black heel develops when constant flexing of the foot causes two
layers of the skin, the dermis and the epidermis, to rub against
each other in a shearing force, said Basler. This breaks small blood
vessels and causes blood to pool between the skin layers, usually at
the heel. The result is blackened skin.
   The same problem can occur on the palms of baseball players,
golfers, weight-lifters and mountain climbers, Basler said.
   He said black heel will correct itself when the activity stops,
but many patients seek treatment because they worry about cancer.
   ``Runner's rump'' is a discoloration at the base of the spine,
where the buttocks come together. The doctor said it is a
pigmentation change caused by the friction of the buttocks rubbing
against each other. The only concern, said Basler, is cosmetic.
   ``Jogger's nipple'' is a more painful problem, usually
experienced by men.
   Basler said it develops among runners who wear shirts that are
not soft. The friction of the cloth during exercise rubs the nipples
raw. Few women experience the problem because they wear soft bras,
he said.
   ``It's surprising how big a problem this can be. It actually
stops some people from running,'' Basler said.
   Prevention is simple: wear a soft cotton undershirt, or cover the
nipples with petroleum jelly or paper medical tape _ or run
bare-chested.
   Pool chemicals can cause swimmers to develop a variety of skin
problems.
   Basler said many pools use bromide instead of chlorine to control
bacteria in the water and this can lead to a form of acne called
``bikini bottom.''
   The ailment usually consists of acne-like pimples and nodules,
most often on the backside.
   ``It looks very much like classic acne,'' said Basler, ``except
it's usually under the swimsuit.''
   Treatment and prevention are both achieved by ``not sitting
around in wet swimsuits,'' he said.
   Basler said some patients who swim frequently also come to him
because of light-colored hair that suddenly turns green.
   The color change is a result of copper in the pool water that
``gives a real distinctive greenish tint to the hair,'' he said. The
treatment is to bleach the hair with peroxide.
   Another water-related injury is actually considered a scar of
triumph, he said.
   He said people who spend hours riding the waves on boards develop
what is called ``surfer's nodules.'' These are bumps of hard tissue
that arise on the foot as a result of long-term contact with the
surf board. Often the bumps contain grains of sand.
   The nodules cause no harm, said Basler, and ``the surfers
consider them a badge of honor. They're proud of them.''
   All athletes who spend hours exercising in sweaty sneakers can
develop something that Basler calls ``toxic sock syndrome.''
   The ailment is characterized by an outrageously powerful foot
odor and is caused by a bacterium that grows in the soft tissue of
the feet. Left alone, it can cause pits to develop in the skin, he
said.
   Treatment is with over-the-counter acne medication containing
benzol peroxide, and prevention is accomplished by using more
absorbent socks and a foot powder.
   Athlete's foot, a fungal infection that can cause itching and
cracking between the toes, remains one of the major skin problems of
the locker room, the doctor said. Medication and care can clear it
up for three months or so, but most people will get it again, he
said, because the fungus takes advantage of a mild immune deficiency
that many people have.
   ``It's essentially an incurable problem,'' Basler said with a
sigh. ``I've had it for 25 years myself.''

<HEAD>AT&T, Sprint Win Multibillion-Dollar Federal Phone Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AT&T and Sprint are the winners in a fierce
contest to provide telephone and high-tech communications services
to the federal government, a prize worth up to $25 billion by the
year 2000.
   The losers were Martin Marietta Corp. and its bidding partner,
MCI.
   MCI said it may challenge the decision, which was made Wednesday
by the General Services Administration. Martin Marietta asked for a
detailed briefing on the decision, which awarded contracts for a new
federal telecommunications system called FTS-2000, providing service
to government agencies through the 1990s.
   GSA awarded the multibillion-dollar contracts three years after
outlining its needs for a new government-wide phone service system
that will include video, computer and other state-of-the-art
communications.
   ``We are elated,'' U.S. Sprint Communications Co. President
William Esrey said.
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. officials expressed equal
delight at the decision, which provided contracts that are among the
largest ever awarded by the U.S. government aside from military and
space program purchases.
   GSA estimated the combined value of the contracts at between $3
billion and $10 billion over 10 years _ but it could reach a maximum
$25 billion. The contracts limit government spending to $15 billion
on the AT&T network and $10 billion on Sprint's.
   The estimates are based on the government's purchase of
long-distance telephone services over a 10-year period. Actual value
will depend on how much service the government actually uses.
   Acting GSA Administrator Richard G. Austin said AT&T received a
contract to provide approximately 60 percent of the service, and
Sprint was awarded the remainder.
   MCI spokeswoman Kathleen Keegan said the company would challenge
the decision in court and before the Federal Communications
Commission if it determines that AT&T used ``predatory'' pricing _
that is, below its direct costs.
   ``MCI priced the long-distance portion of the FTS-2000 bid as
aggressively as possible,'' she said. ``If the long-distance portion
of the winning bids were priced below MCI's, then we do not believe
it is possible for the winners to provide that service on a
profitable basis.''
   The bidding companies designated subcontractors in their
proposals to the GSA. Those included in the losing Martin Marietta
bid were GE-RCA Americacom and McDonnell Douglas Tymnet.
   Boeing Co. and Computer Sciences Corp. were designated AT&T
subcontractors in the winning bid, as well as regional Bell
telephone companies and other local telephone companies.
   Boeing is to provide program management and information services,
and Computer Sciences Corp. will develop and maintain a software
system for billing. The regional telecommunications holding
companies and local companies will provide local network access,
according to AT&T officials.
   Sprint's subcontractor partners include GTE and the regional
telephone companies.
   ``This is an important competitive win for AT&T and our partners
in this project,'' said Richard J. Lombardi, AT&T vice president for
federal services.
   The system is to be phased in over three years, with the first
users to begin service in 1989 and all federal users to be on line
in 1991. Lombardi said he expected service to be in place by next
fall.
   The contract provides for a new all-digital integrated network
replacing what is already the world's largest private
telecommunications network, with service by AT&T. The current system
is capable of carrying only voice and slow-speed data transmissions,
the GSA said.

<TEXT>
   The conservative Heritage Foundation today
released the full 927 pages of what it hopes will be a blueprint for
the incoming Bush administration.
   The third quadrennial ``Mandate for Leadership'' book contains
more than 2,000 recommendations on running the government in a
manner acceptable to the conservative think-tank. Major portions of
the report had already been made public prior to today's formal
release.
   The Reagan administration adhered to many of the recommendations
in the first such volume, issued in 1980, and the foundation hopes
for similar results once George Bush takes office next month.
   The new book includes recommendations on how to run the
transition, how to deal with Congress, foreign affairs and all the
departments and major agencies.
   It recommends a harder-nosed approach on holding down federal
spending, including subjecting all programs including Social
Security to the Gramm-Rudman deficit ceiling law.
   The book repeats a host of other Heritage positions including
letting workers opt out of Social Security in favor of private
retirement accounts, pressing ahead with President Reagan's Star
Wars missile defense system, and renewing military aid to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua.
   This ``Mandate'' is actually 166 pages shorter than the 1980
tome, which ran 1,093 pages. ``Mandate for Leadership II,'' in
Reagan's midterm, ran 565 pages.

   -
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived at the United
Nations this week with precisely the message people across the globe
most wanted to hear from a man with his finger on the button: it's
time to stop using military might to settle political disputes _
nobody's omnipotent.
   Even in his hurried departure from the United States, Gorbachev
was showing a face of Kremlin leadership that stood in stark
contrast to the shoe-waving visit of the last Soviet leader to visit
the United Nations.
   Addressing diplomats who know well that he is wrestling with
difficult choices between guns and butter, Gorbachev on Wednesday
delivered a poignant call for peaceful coexistence punctuated with a
theatrical announcement of Red Army troop reductions.
   ``Our people want to live in peace with the American people,'' he
said at one point. Later, sightseeing in Manhattan, he remarked,
``We're very pleased by the fact that thousands of New Yorkers have
come out to see us. We saw their faces, we saw their eyes, their
friendliness.''
   All in all, quite different from the 1960 visit of Nikita
Khrushchev.
   It was Khrushchev who took off his shoe, waved it around and then
pounded it on his desk in anger. He was unhappy when a speaker had
referred to Eastern Europe as nations which ``have been swallowed
up, more or less, by the Soviet Union.''
   Gorbachev was polished and polite, making friends from his
arrival on _ but never so many as with his declaration on unilateral
troop reductions. Even his sudden departure demonstrated a fresh
character of Soviet leadership: Gorbachev was returning home to cope
with a devastating earthquake had killed thousands in the Soviet
Caucasus region.
   ``Despite the fact that all emergency measures are being taken
... Mr. Gorbachev believes when the people are suffering he has to
be there, he has to lead the efforts,'' the Soviet foreign minister
said late last night.
   Gorbachev left behind him a troop-reduction timetable that many
experts had expected last spring as a welcome-to-Moscow gesture
toward President Reagan. The American view, clearly, was better late
than never, and officials applauded Gorbachev's call at the United
Nations for less reliance on military force.
   The commander of armaments as ferocious as any in history told
the United Nations that the days were over when military force ``can
or must be an instrument of foreign policy.''
   It may well come as a surprise to students of history _ students
of Chile's humiliation of Bolivia and Peru in the War of the
Pacific, for example, or of Genghis Khan's mastery of the ``feigned
retreat'' in establishing the Mongol empire _ that force is not the
only way to settle disputes.
   In a world besot with thermonuclear arms, where the next war
could be the last, the world thirsts for another way.
   The internal problems of the Soviet Union have apparently
prompted the Politburo to seek another way as well.
   ``It is now quite clear that building up military power makes no
country omnipotent,'' Gorbachev said. Tacitly acknowledging the
realities of a sputtering economy at home, he added, ``What's more,
one-sided reliance on military power ultimately weakens other
components of national security.''
   He said the Soviet Union will reorganize Soviet divisions in
Eastern Europe so they are ``clearly defensive.'' He said it plans
to cut soldiers and armaments in the European part of his country
and in its Asian territory. In Mongolia, for instance, ``a major
portion of Soviet troops temporarily stationed there will return
home'' _ words that are sure to gain favor with Khan's ancestors and
the communist leaders of China.
   Gorbachev has called on the United States and its allies to
respond with ``some certain steps'' of their own. But Western
leaders _ distrustful of Soviet leaders generally and of the public
relations wizardry of Mikhail Gorbachev specifically _ will want to
see and hear more from Moscow.
   Secretary of State George Shultz praised the announced troop
reductions as a ``significant step in the right direction,'' but
said even after they are complete in 1991 Moscow would still enjoy
an advantage in European conventional forces.
   Asked if the Cold War were over, Shultz mulled the semantics and
finally said he thought at least that things were now ``different.''
   Different in large part because Gorbachev continues to present a
wholly different face to the West than the stolid Leonid Brezhnev or
Khrushchev, perhaps best remembered for snarling, ``We will bury
you.'' Gorbachev toured New York and called it ``a unique city, a
city of splendid identity and architecture.''
   ``There is no question that Mr. Gorbachev is a very different
individual than his predecessors,'' President-elect Bush said in
assessing Gorbachev after Wednesday's power lunch. ``He is a warm
human being.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
claiming to have resolved his country's human rights problems at
home, says the World Court should have binding jurisdiction over
enforcement of international human rights agreements.
   In a wide-ranging address Wednesday to the U.N. General Assembly,
the Soviet leader called for vastly expanded responsibilities for
the world body once shunned by his predecessors. He also declared
his government no longer holds political prisoners.
   Responding to Western criticism of Soviet emigration policy,
Gorbachev said the Kremlin has applied strict time limits on the use
of state secrecy as a reason for refusing Jews permission to
emigrate.
   Although Western observers generally acknowledge there have been
dramatic reductions in the number of political prisoners since
Gorbachev rose to power, human rights groups still count about 150
people they say are being held solely because of their political or
religious beliefs.
   Gorbachev said, ``The problem of exit from and entry to our
country, including the question of leaving it for family
reunification, is being dealt with in a humane spirit.'' But he gave
no indication the Soviet Union is prepared to open its borders to
unrestricted travel or emigration.
   Gorbachev also proposed a substantially broader role for the U.N.
and world organizations, including the International Court of
Justice at The Hague, Netherlands, commonly known as the World Court.
   The Soviets have long promoted the concept of making the World
Court's human-rights rulings mandatory, particularly on the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ the Soviet Union,
United States, China, Britain and France.
   The court's opinions now are advisory, and nations tend to abide
by them only when they so choose.
   ``We believe that the jurisdiction of the International Court of
Justice at The Hague as regards the interpretation and
implementation of agreements on human rights should be binding on
all states,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``Our ideal is a world community of states which are based on the
rule of law and which subordinate their foreign policy activities to
law,'' he said.
   On the subject of Soviet emigration policy, one of Gorbachev's
closest advisers, Alexander Yakovlev, a member of the Communist
Party's ruling Politburo, told an American peace coalition after the
speech that he does not believe ``that there are any serious
obstacles to those who want to emigrate.''
   He said ``the process of disarmament'' has not reached a stage at
which it is possible to let those with military secrets leave the
country, but Yakovlev contended there are fewer than 46 such cases
remaining.
   ``This is unfortunate,'' he added, ``but it is another motivation
to disarm.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said, ``This is a
problem that has disappeared'' with the establishment of an appeal
procedure to permit review of refuseniks' cases.
   In his speech, Gorbachev also called for sending U.N.
peacekeepers into Afghanistan and for barring weapons from outer
space.
   The Soviet president proposed establishment of a ``peace corps''
to rebuild war-torn Afghanistan and a team of international
scientists to deal with environmental disasters.
   Turning from war on the ground to peace in the heavens, Gorbachev
said, ``The Soviet Union is also ready to cooperate in establishing
an international space laboratory or manned orbital station designed
exclusively for monitoring the state of the environment.''
   ``All activities in outer space must rule out the appearance of
weapons there. ... There is already a strongly felt need to develop
an all-embracing regime for peaceful work in outer space. The
verification of compliance with that regime would be entrusted to a
World Space Organization,'' an idea that the Soviets have been
promoting in the United Nations for several years.
   ``We are prepared to incorporate within its system our
Krasnoyarsk radar station'' in Siberia, he added. The United States
has claimed the facility violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty and must be dismantled.
   Gerasimov said Wednesday all military personnel have been
withdrawn from the radar station and, ``There is no Krasnoyarsk
radar station any more.''
   ``Soviet scientists,'' Gorbachev declared, ``are prepared to
receive their foreign colleagues and discuss with them ways of
converting it into an international center for peaceful cooperation
by dismantling and refitting certain units and structures, and to
provide additional equipment. The entire system could function under
the auspices of the United Nations.''
   A major function of the space laboratory would be to keep track
of pollution, for which Gorbachev had another proposal:
   ``Let us also think about setting up within the framework of the
United Nations a center for emergency environmental assistance. Its
function would be promptly to send international groups of experts
to areas with badly deteriorating environment,'' he said.
   Developing nations have been crushed by debt repayment schedules
during the 1980s; the total Third World debt is over $1.2 trillion,
and many nations can't even pay the interest on their loans.
   Gorbachev proposed ``limiting their official debt-servicing
payments depending on the economic performance of each of them or
granting them a long period of deferral in the repayment of a major
portion of their debt.''
   He offered a moratorium on debt service of up to 100 years for
the most needy debtor nations.
   He backed the appeal of the Geneva-based U.N. Conference on Trade
and Development for reducing debts owed to commercial banks, which
are almost exclusively in Western nations.

<HEAD>Widow Says Soviet Revolutionariy Leader Was Ignorant Of Stalin's
Plotting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Russian revolutionary leader Nikolai Bukharin
returned to Moscow from Paris never dreaming that he'd be jailed and
executed in a Stalinist purge, his widow said in a television
interview.
   Bukharin's ignorance of dictator Josef Stalin's murderous plans
may explain the mystery of why Bukharin came home despite the purge,
Anna Larina Bukharin said in Wednesday's broadcast.
   Her husband and other victims of Stalin may have had some idea of
what was going on, ``But not to such an extent,'' she said.
   Bukharin and 15 other veteran Bolsheviks were posthumously
rehabilitated July 9 and readmitted to the ruling Communist Party.
In February, the Soviet Supreme Court cleared Bukharin and the
others of treason, spying and other charges for which they were
executed or imprisoned.
   Mrs. Bukharin, interviewed in Moscow, spoke in Russian in a
British Broadcasting Corp. program titled ``Bukharin and the
Terror'' that claimed to shed new light on one of the most notorious
episodes in Soviet history.
   Mrs. Bukharin said Stalin, in planning to get rid of her husband,
sent him to Paris in 1936, ostensibly to collect party documents.
   Bukharin's motives for returning to Moscow have long been a
subject of speculated, since it was widely believed he must have
known that he was under threat.
   ``Nikolai didn't have an inkling, no. I think he still wouldn't
have believed (if he had known). He would have returned just the
same. He wasn't like that _ he would have returned to have his say,
to put his case,'' Mrs. Bukharin said.
   Bukharin was often seen as a likely successor to his close friend
Vladimir Lenin, who led the 1917 revolution and founded the Soviet
Union, and to whom Bukharian acted as economic adviser.
   Lenin called Bukharin ``not only the most valuable theoretician
of the party but the favorite of us all.''
   Stalin, the party organizer, used Bukharin as his theorist and
ally after Lenin died in 1924. But Bukharin opposed excesses in
Stalin's forced collectivization and industrialization and in
February 1937 he was arrested and tortured in prison before being
tried in March 1938 and executed.
   The program said Bukharin's body has never been found and that
his widow was also arrested, banished to Astrakhan on the Caspian
Sea and kept in prisons and camps for 20 years, not seeing their
only son in all that time until he was 21.
   Stalin died in 1953. Mrs. Bukharin said that in 1961, when Nikita
Khrushchev was in power, she was called to a commission
investigating her husband's case and shown a testament he had
written, the same document that her husband had asked her to
memorize.
   In his testament, Bukharin said he felt his ``helplessness in the
face of a hellish machine.''
   He said he was sure history would prove him innocent and that a
``young and honest generation of party leaders'' would vindicate him
and reinstate him in the party.
   ``Know comrades, that on the banner which you will bear on the
triumphant procession toward communism there is also a drop of my
blood,'' Bukharin wrote.
   Mrs. Bukharin, who was her husband's third wife and 25 years his
junior, said she first met him when they and Stalin occupied
apartments in what is now Moscow's Metropole Hotel.

<HEAD>Study: Program To Reduce Caesareans Could Save $1 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One hospital's solution to the runaway use of
Caesarean sections could eliminate 450,000 needless operations and
save more than $1 billion a year if adopted nationally, according to
a study published today.
   However, some experts question whether the program, developed at
Mount Sinai Medical Center in Chicago, could easily be copied at
other hospitals because doctors are too afraid of malpractice suits
to follow the proposed rules.
   Doctors at Mount Sinai reduced the Caesarean rate to half the
nationwide level by instituting five guidelines for performing them,
according to the report in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
Use of forceps deliveries also fell.
   ``To a large extent, there has been a more hands-off attitude
toward taking care of our patients,'' said Dr. Stephen A. Myers,
director of maternal-fetal medicine.
   Caesarean sections are the most common form of surgery in the
United States. Many experts agree that physicians perform far too
many Caesareans, but there is little consensus over how to cut back.
   Between 1985-87, Mount Sinai's program lowered the Caesarean rate
from 17.5 percent to 11.5 percent of deliveries. The number of
maternity patients at the hospital for the years totaled 6,099.
   Nationwide last year, 24.4 percent of the 3.8 million births were
Caesarean deliveries.
   ``We lowered it not from 24 to 17 percent, but from 17 to 11
percent, which is even harder to do,'' said Myers.
   ``It's like going on a diet. The first five pounds are easy. The
last five pounds are tough.''
   The hospital accomplished the reduction by setting these rules:
   _Except in emergencies, second opinions must be obtained before
all Caesareans.
   _Vaginal deliveries are preferred for all patients who have
undergone previous Caesareans.
   _Difficult birth is considered to be an acceptable reason for a
Caesarean only if a women fails to deliver after two hours of strong
regular uterine contractions.
   _Fetal distress must be confirmed by a blood sample drawn from
the fetus.
   _Vaginal deliveries are recommended for nearly all breech births,
those in which the baby appears bottom first.
   _A peer review process ensures that all doctors follow the rules.
Those who seem to be performing too many are notified, although no
disciplinary action is taken.
   Myers and colleague Dr. Norbert Gleicher estimated that if their
program were adopted by other hospitals, the United States could
avoid 450,000 Caesareans. Hospitals charge about $3,000 more for
Caesareans than for vaginal births, and doctors charge $250 to $500
more.
   At Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, Dr. Benjamin Sachs said
doctors frequently do Caesareans at the first sign of fetal distress
because they fear they will be sued for malpractice if anything goes
wrong.
   ``I don't think what they have done in this particular hospital
is going to be easy to duplicate in the environment that we have
today,'' Sachs said.
   In an editorial, Dr. Frederick C. Battaglia of the University of
Colorado questioned whether the Chicago doctors paid enough
attention to the safety of sharply reducing Caesareans.
   The doctors said the reduction made no difference in the death
rate among babies or mothers. Although there were more reports of
depressed breathing among infants, they said this was probably
because doctors were more alert to this problem, not because of a
true increase in its occurrence.
   Myers said doctors at the hospital were generally enthusiastic
about the program, although some women were unhappy when told they
could not have Caesareans.
   ``Some women say, `I don't want to go through that aggravation. I
want another Caesarean section,''' Myers said. ``But because they
say it, that's not a valid reason to do it. We said, `No, we are
going to have a trial of labor.'''

<TEXT>
   President and Nancy Reagan compared notes at the
White House after a day of superpower summitry and found they'd both
swapped invitations with their Soviet counterparts to make return
visits with each other some day.
   The president and first lady had come to New York for their final
official meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife,
Raisa. The foursome had been together at three previous summits
dating back to 1985.
   The Reagans plan to retire to their home state of California
after the inauguration of President-elect George Bush in January.
They will have a residence in Los Angeles, and plan to retain their
688-acre ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains outside of Santa Barbara.
   Prior to Gorbachev's first visit to the United States last
December for the Washington summit, Reagan often said he wanted
Gorbachev to tour the United States. Gorbachev, however, did no
touring and spent only a few days in Washington.
   At the White House late Wednesday, Mrs. Reagan told the president
she'd invited Mrs. Gorbachev to return to the United States, and
that Mrs. Gorbachev had responded in kind. ``The president came home
and said he'd had the same exchange'' with the Soviet president,
said Elaine Crispen, press secretary to Mrs. Reagan.
   The president and Mrs. Reagan had returned to Washington on
separate planes and discussed the events of the day when they got
back to the executive mansion, Mrs. Crispen said.
   The spokeswoman, who flew back to Washington with Mrs. Reagan and
Barbara Bush, said she spoke with Mrs. Reagan by telephone after
she'd returned to the White House.
   While Reagan met with Gorbachev on Governors Island in New York
Harbor, Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Gorbachev attended an exclusive
luncheon hosted by Marcela Perez de Cuellar, the wife of the U.N.
Secretary General.
   Mrs. Gorbachev told Mrs. Reagan that ``destiny had brought them
together'' and that she was certain they'd see each other in the
future, Mrs. Crispen said the first lady related. Mrs. Gorbachev
expressed the hope that the Reagans would return to the Soviet Union
and see more than they'd been able to during last year's Moscow
summit, Mrs. Crispen said.
   Mrs. Reagan responded, ``Yes, she'd like to do that, and added
that she'd like to have them come to California,'' Mrs. Crispen said.
   Both Reagans told the Gorbachevs ``they had always hoped they
would see the West as well as the East, because they are totally
different,'' Mrs. Crispen said.
   The couples agreed that ``time constraints'' during their past
meetings had kept them from seeing all the sights that they'd
wanted, and that they hoped ``maybe something could be worked out in
the future,'' Mrs. Crispen said.
   The spokeswoman said the invitations were not specific and that
``they didn't talk about times.''
   Mrs. Crispen said Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Bush celebrated their
joint return home by having a picture taken, because they have
rarely traveled together on official trips.
   ``They talked all the way home,'' Mrs. Crispen said, primarily
about their plans for the holidays.

<HEAD>Women Urged To Consider Initial $725 Offer for Injuries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who accept a $725 compensation offer for
injuries caused by Dalkon Shield birth-control devices may be giving
up claims worth many times that amount, according to representatives
of organizations that support these victims.
   ``We've waited for years and we urge women to take the time now
to make a careful decision about this first offer,'' Nancy Worth
Davis of the Dalkon Shield Oversight Consortium told a news
conference on Wednesday.
   Nearly 200,000 women have filed claims of Dalkon Shield-related
injuries ranging from infections to sterility, miscarriage and
children born with birth defects.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Merhige of Richmond, Va., has approved
a $2.4 billion trust fund for women injured by the birth control
device. On Dec. 5, the administrators of the trust fund sent letters
to women who used the shields offering them $725 to settle all
claims as ``Option 1.''
   The letter makes clear that it is only for women ``whose injuries
are less severe or have very little, if any, proof to support their
claim and who feel that $725 is fair and adequate compensation.'' A
separate ``Option 1'' will be offered to those who claim injury
because of someone else's use, such as the husbands or children of
users.
   Other options, not yet available, will address more serious and
specific injuries.
   Ms. Davis said ``this letter does not tell women what they are
giving up in exchange for the $725 that it asks women to take. The
first offering is a throw-away offering.
   ``This letter is for women who were not seriously injured; women
who have minimal claims or women who may have worn a Shield for a
couple of months and suffered from it and removed it immediately,''
she said.
   The A.H. Robins Co., which manufactured the Dalkon Shield,
declared bankruptcy three years ago. Last July, American Home
Products Corp. agreed to buy the company and set up a trust fund to
compensate the claimants.
   Sybil Shainwald of Health Action International said there were
1.7 million foreign users of the device and ``many of them are still
wearing this time bomb in their bodies since no adequate recall
campaign has ever been undertaken by Robins or by any government.
   ``Robins spent $4.5 million in the U.S. and approximately
$500,000 outside the U.S. to notify women of their rights, an
obvious discrimination at the time against foreign women ... women
throughout the world were the guinea pigs for an unsafe and untested
birth control device. They paid with their wombs and their lives.''
   She said women should remember ``this is not a final offer, but
an elimination process.''
   Several women at the news conference objected to the judge's
recent removal of the female chairman and two of the trustees
supervising the trust.
   Merhige removed the trustees Nov. 28 after a complaint that they
had shown bad judgment resulting in inaction and delays. There were
only five members on the board.
   ``Judge Merhige fired the only women who were trustees of the
victims' settlement fund and the only trustees who were nominated by
the victims,'' said Constance Miller-Engelsberg, a board member of
the International Dalkon Shield Victims Educational Association.
   Karen Hicks of the Dalkon Shield Information Network said the
dismissals threaten the independence and integrity of the trust fund.
   ``We have watched our strongest advocates get chewed up and spit
out, discredited, and disempowered,'' she said.

   The man chosen by George Bush to be United
Nations ambassador told Iran-Contra congressional investigators he
acted as a courier in a secret plan to provide military equipment to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels at a time U.S. government assistance
was prohibited.
   Thomas Pickering testified in July 1987 before the Senate Select
Committee that investigated the Reagan administration's secret arms
sales to Iran and the subsequent diversion of profits to the Contras.
   Pickering told the panel he carried a document provided by a
private group that planned to provide weapons to the Contras, giving
it to then-National Security aide Oliver North.
   He said he believed the document discussed a donation or sale of
weapons and equipment with a ``dollar value which was in the
millions.''
   Pickering was ambassador to El Salvador when he delivered the
document to North. In his testimony, he said he did not consider his
action to have violated the Boland Amendment, which at the time
prohibited U.S. aid to the Contras.
   He said he did not report his actions through normal State
Department channels because of the sensitivity of the private
operation and he wouldn't have known whom in the department to
notify.
   Pickering said he had been contacted by someone representing the
group and asked if he would help deliver the document. Pickering did
not identify the group in his testimony other than to say it was
``engaged either in soliciting or receiving assistance for the
Contras.''
   Pickering told the panel ``the group had information about a
donation'' and wanted the document to go to Contra leader Adolfo
Calero. Pickering said he delivered the document to North, who
subsequently confirmed receiving it.
   Pickering, currently the U.S. ambassador to Israel, was named
Tuesday by President-elect George Bush as his U.N. ambassador.
   The Washington Post recounted Pickering's Iran-Contra testimony
in an article in its editions today.
   Pickering testified that the document contained ``a list of
military equipment ... purported to be available for support of the
Contras, I think either from a private source or a foreign
government source.'' He said he delivered the document to North at
the White House either in December 1984 or early in 1985.
   Pickering said during his testimony that he could not recall
exactly when Congress had enacted the Boland Amendment, which in
October 1984 prohibited the U.S. government from aiding the Contra
rebels. But he said he believed U.S. officials ``were in complete
observation'' of the amendment because of conversations he had with
an official whose name is blacked out in the testimony.

   The Atlantis returned from its
four-day secret space mission more bruised than normal, but the
damage is not severe enough to delay its next scheduled launch, NASA
says.
   Up to 175 thermal tiles were heavily damaged, apparently during
liftoff, possibly by something loose hitting the orbiter, said
Conrad Nagel, Atlantis' processing director.
   ``The damage comparatively is significant, but it's not a major
concern,'' he said Wednesday. ``We have to understand why we had
this damage and keep it from happening again.''
   Nagel said the damage would be easy to fix and that it would not
affect Atlantis' next flight, scheduled for launch April 28 with a
spacecraft that is to be dispatched to the planet Venus. Overall, he
said, Atlantis returned from its classified military mission on
Tuesday in ``very clean'' shape.
   There were only a few minor technical problems during the flight,
he said. One entailed a minor malfunction in the shuttle's air
conditioning system, causing about a gallon of water to leak into
the cabin. The astronauts used a vacuum cleaner to clean it up,
Nagel said.
   During the flight, the five astronauts inspected and assessed the
battered tiles, using a television camera on the end of the ship's
50-foot robot arm, Nagel said.
   The shuttle is covered with about 28,000 tiles made of various
materials designed to protect it from atmospheric re-entry heat. He
said the tile damage posed no threat to the shuttle's return to
Earth.
   Nagel said the heaviest damage was concentrated in a strip
3-to-4-feet long ``down the right hand side, along the line of the
fuselage.''
   One tile in the nose was missing and ``it looked like it was
popped off by the impact of something,'' he said.
   There was speculation here that a part from the solid fuel
booster rockets, the external tank or the orbiter might have fallen
off and hit the craft. Nagel said he did not want to speculate.
   A small fiberglass panel was missing from one of Atlantis'
maneuvering engines, but this probably did not cause the problem,
officials said.
   Nagel made his comments in an interview from Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., where he leads a team that is inspecting Atlantis and
preparing it for return to the Kennedy Space Center here Tuesday
atop a Boeing 747 airliner.
   He said Atlantis' tile damage was about twice that suffered by
Discovery, which made the first post-Challenger shuttle flight two
months ago.
   ``It appears that between 125 and 175 tiles will have to be
scrapped and replaced,'' Nagel said. In addition, he said, scores of
tiles with scratches and ``dings'' will have to be repaired in place.
   ``Dinged'' tiles are common on a shuttle, with much of the damage
being caused by objects kicked up from the runway when the vehicle
lands.
   He reported brakes and about 200 other systems modified since the
Challenger explosion 34 months ago worked well.

<HEAD>More Than 1,700 Civilians Reported Killed in War This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,700 civilians were
killed and another 231 noncombatants disappeared in political
violence this year, the independent Human Rights Commission of El
Salvador says.
   In a report released Wednesday, the commission said 1,747
civilians were killed in politically related violence between
January and November.
   Citing witness testimony, it said 140 of the civilians reported
to have ``disappeared'' had been abducted by government troops.
   The report did not specify who was responsibvle for the remainder
of the disappearances, saying it had found no witnesses.
   The government had no immediate comment on the report.
   The commission did not include combat casualties in the
9-year-old war pitting Marxist-led guerrillas against the
U.S.-supported government.
   In November alone, the commission said, 170 civilians were
assassinated and 16 others kidnapped. It said its findings coincided
with an increase in the activities of so-called death squads and
reported discoveries of corpses bearing signs of torture.
   ``The activities indicate the interest of the armed forces and
the government to return to the state of terror and the peace of the
cemeteries,'' said a commission official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   More than 65,000 Salvadorans have been killed in the civil war,
the majority of them civilians.
   Deaths squad activity reached a peak in the early 1980s, when
paramilitary groups reportedly linked to the armed forces persecuted
suspected government opponents.
   Armed forces reports compiled by The Associated Press allege that
the guerrillas are responsible for more than 300 civilian deaths in
1988, suffered either in attacks or explosions of rebel land mines.

<HEAD>Trying to Protect Vast Areas From Poachers Not Always Best,
Researchers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elephant and rhinoceros populations declined in
Zambian wildlife areas because anti-poaching efforts covered too
much land, scientists reported today.
   Developing countries should concentrate anti-poaching efforts on
portions of their large wildlife conservation areas if they cannot
protect all the land adequately, the researchers said.
   Rhino populations declined 63 percent a year and elephant numbers
dropped 12 percent a year between 1979 and 1985 in Zambia's Luangwa
Valley, despite an anti-poaching operation than began in 1979, the
researchers wrote.
   Areas most patrolled by authorities showed the least decline, and
vice versa, taking into account the size of each area, the
researchers wrote in today's issue of the British joural Nature.
   Results ``support the view that an important factor in the
overall decline in rhino and elephant numbers across the rest of
Africa is a shortage of manpower, and ultimately of resources,
within national conservation departments,'' said N. Leader-Williams
and S.D. Albon of the University of Cambridge in England.
   In countries that spend relatively little on conservation, the
best strategy to protect economically valuable animals is probably
to concentrate resources on relatively small areas of the reserves,
the researchers wrote.
   Such an approach has already helped in stabilizing numbers of
black rhinos in Kenya over the past year or so, they said.

<HEAD>Endowments Rise Despite Market Crash</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Caspa correct in 5th graf</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College endowments, buffeted by the October
1987 stock market crash, still posted a small gain in the last
fiscal year, a college business group reports.
   The National Association of College and University Business
Officers said preliminary results from its survey of 100 major
endowment funds indicated an average gain of 0.2 percent for the
year ended last June 1.
   That was down from a 13.8 percent gain for the campus endowments
in fiscal 1987, the group said Wednesday. It beat the minus-7.1
percent return on the Standard & Poor's 500 during the year.
Government and corporate bonds rose 7.5 percent during the same year.
   The business officers have tracked major campus endowments
annually since 1971.
   Caspa L. Harris, executive vice president of the association,
said, ``To the extent that one can point to a single reason for the
sharp decline in endowment returns, the October `crash' is
responsible.''
   Endowment funds ``are invested primarily in publicly traded
securities, and history suggests that the market values of such
securities fluctuate widely based on changes in investor
psychology,'' he said.

<HEAD>Consumers Boost Debt by $3.5 Billion in October</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer spending was up in October, as
Americans took out $3.56 billion more in consumer debt than they
paid off, the government said.
   The October increase followed a tiny $2 million rise in debt
during September, the smallest change in six years, the Federal
Reserve said Wednesday. Consumer credit fell by $81 million in
October 1982 at the bottom of the last recession.
   The October advance, which translated into credit growth at an
annual rate of 6.5 percent, was still down from the 8.75 percent
annual rate of growth recorded over the first nine months of the
year.
   Still, analysts said they believed consumer spending was
strengthening after a period of sluggishness. They noted that retail
sales shot up 0.9 percent in October, the biggest gain in seven
months.
   ``The latest numbers suggest that consumers are a little more
optimistic about buying,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington
consulting firm. ``I think they are not fighting higher prices as
much as they had in the past.''
   Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of overall economic
activity. Newfound strength in the consumer sector has prompted some
analysts to boost their projections for growth in the current
October-December quarter.

<HEAD>Political Parties Considering Convention Changes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of both major political parties are
looking at ways to update and perhaps shorten the next national
conventions in 1992.
   The Commission on National Political Conventions plans to make
recommendations to both the Democratic and Republican parties before
the parties begin planning their next nominating conventions.
   Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., who steps down in January as Republican
national chairman, and Charles T. Manatt, former Democratic national
chairman, are co-chairmen of the commission. Both said at a news
conference Wednesday they want to update conventions in an era when
changing nominating rules and growth of the primary system have
removed much of the suspense.
   Fahrenkopf said in some cases professional wrestling programs on
competing stations drew more viewers than the television networks'
coverage of the two conventions last summer. ``It may have been more
interesting at times,'' he said.
   The GOP leader said the commission would consider whether
conventions could be ``streamlined in some way, to make it crisper,
make it cleaner from the standpoint of presenting a program that
will attract more Americans to watch it.''
   He said the panel, which includes some network television
representatives, would also ``take a hard look at what really the
role should be of the media,'' particularly television, in covering
conventions.

<HEAD>Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater Has 30th Birthday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alumni came back and danced with the present
company of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. There was
thrilling dancing and attempted dancing by Bill Cosby, with many
short speeches and one long one at the end by Ailey.
   It was a celebration of the company's 30th birthday, on opening
night of a season that will extend through Jan. 1 at the City Center.
   ``This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine,'' was
Wednesday night's theme, applied to Ailey's creating a modern dance
company to preserve classics by many choreographers and the black
heritage and to forge into the new.
   Ailey, wearing the decoration of Kennedy Center Honors, which he
received Saturday, around his neck, gestured toward some of his past
dancers and said their secret was they'd kept dancing. ``They're not
as young as they look.
   ``I'm about to burst into tears. Whether they got mad, I fired
them, they left to start their own companies, go on Broadway or have
babies, we always come together. That's the essence of what we're
about, distilling the spirit with movement.''
   The evening began with the ``I Been 'Buked'' section of
``Revelations,'' by present and past company members, including
James Truitte, whose hair now is gray.
   Then Cosby, in a green stocking cap, red tights and leg warmers,
loudly told the audience, ``All my life I've wanted to dance with
Alvin Ailey and now through comedy I got the chance to express
myself.'' He did some undulations, had his posture corrected by a
girl and had men arrive on each side to strike athletic poses. He
reacted by covering his chest with a scarf.
   There were 18 numbers, in most cases parts of dances. The list is
long of even the exciting ones. Mari Kajiwara, Sarita Allen and
Linda Kent, in the part that always was her best when she was a
company member, danced ``The House of the Rising Sun.'' The
beautiful Carmen de Lavallade had a solo. The alumni men, including
Ulysses Dove, George Faison, John Parks, Dudley Williams and Miguel
Godreau, sporting a bush of hair, were thrilling in ``Mean Ol'
Frisco.''
   There was vigor and striking individual turns in Talley Beatty's
hip and streetwise ``The Stack-Up.'' Faison's ``(Try a Little)
Tenderness'' was danced with unflagging verve. The final sections
were from Ailey's own masterpiece, ``Revelations.'' Myrna White's
dancing had a purity in ``Wading in the Water.'' And ``Rocka My Soul
in the Bosom of Abraham'' was, as always, joyfully faith affirming.
   Frank E. Resnick, president of Phillip Morris Companies, the
Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater's largest corporate sponsor since
1981, said the evening would raise $225,000 for the company.

<HEAD>Three Decades Of Rockers Pay Tribute To Orbison</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three decades of rock 'n' rollers and
country stars paid tribute to Roy Orbison, remembering the
black-clad balladeer as an angel-voiced original who pioneered the
early days of rock.
   ``Roy didn't copy anybody, but it cannot be said that a lot of
people didn't borrow from Orbison. And they'll tell you that _ from
the Beatles to Bruce Springsteen,'' veteran recording artist Carl
Perkins said Wednesday.
   ``He was and always will be one of the greats of rock 'n' roll,''
said former Beatle Paul McCartney.
   Orbison, who rose to fame with early 1960s hits like ``Oh, Pretty
Woman,'' ``Only the Lonely'' and ``Cryin''' and recently returned to
the charts with a group of rock legends, died of a heart attack
shortly before midnight Tuesday in a hospital in nearby
Hendersonville. He was 52.
   He had been visiting his mother, Nadine, earlier in the day.
   ``It hurts too much today to say a lot about Roy Orbison,'' said
Johnny Cash, who lived next door to Orbison for more than 20 years
in Hendersonville.
   ``For 30 years, we were heart to heart, sharing the good times
and the bad. I have lost one in my most inner circle of friends. He
more than deserves all the praise and plaudits that he has received
lately,'' Cash said.
   Orbison had 27 straight records on the charts during his heyday
in the early 1960s. He recorded for Sam Phillips at Sun Records, the
label that launched the careers of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis,
Cash and Perkins.
   His dark attire, ebony pompadour and ever-present sunglasses were
a virtual trademark. But fellow artists remembered him for his
effortless three-octave voice that crooned ballads of lost love.
   ``He had to be one of the best, if not the best, singers I've
ever worked with,'' Phillips said. ``He was an unusual guitarist
also, and a great one. But he could sing things that would make you
stop and stand at attention.''
   Lewis called Orbison ``a great singer. He worked hard at it ...
(it) probably will be a big loss to a lot of fans. I was a fan. I'll
miss him.''
   ``He had the voice of an angel,'' said Billy Joel. ``His loss
with be felt by anyone who loves rock 'n' roll.''
   Orbison's recent recordings as one of The Traveling Wilburys _
along with ex-Beatle George Harrison, Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and Jeff
Lynne _ brought him a new generation of fans. The group's ``Handle
With Care'' is No. 45 on the charts, and their swift-selling album
``The Traveling Wilburys'' is No. 8.
   ``I've been rediscovered by young kids who had never heard of me
before the Wilburys,'' Orbison said earlier this year in an
interview with The Associated Press.
   ``It's very nice to be wanted again, but I still can't quite
believe it.''
   Harrison and Petty said through publicists that they were too
stunned by Orbison's death to comment immediately.
   ``He was as gentle, wise, and mysterious as his voice,'' said
U2's Bono, who recently recorded with Orbison in Memphis.
   ``Starting over more than once, he was at the time of his death
the finest white pop singer on the planet. Writing a song for him
was like writing a song for Elvis Presley, the only other comparable
vocal talent.''
   Orbison's career peaked in the first half of the 1960s but tailed
off in the aftermath of his wife's death in a motorcycle accident in
1966 and the deaths of two of his three sons, ages 10 and 6, in a
fire that destroyed his $150,000 lakeside home in 1968.
   His biggest success came with ``Oh, Pretty Woman,'' about a
flirtatious episode, which sold more than 7 million copies in 1964.
A cover version later was a hit for Van Halen.
   Presley, one year Orbison's senior, introduced him in 1977 as
``the greatest singer in the world.'' Bruce Springsteen saluted him
in his song ``Thunder Road.''
   Emmylou Harris, who collaborated with Orbison on the
Grammy-winning 1980 song ``That Loving You Feeling Again,'' called
him ``one of the greatest singers that ever lived. There will never
be another like him.''
   ``Roy Orbison was a great musician and a great friend to country
music. We have lost a giant,'' said Dolly Parton.
   Orbison's business manager-wife, Barbara, was en route to
California from Germany early today to arrange for services.

   The head of the Soviet armed forces, who has
opposed unilateral cuts in Red Army conventional forces, resigned
the same day President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced a major
cutback of 500,000 troops.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov confirmed
Wednesday's resignation of Sergei Akhromeyev, 65, but said the
marshal's decision was based on poor health and not in protest of
Gorbachev's move.
   ``He supported the proposals in the speech'' Gorbachev gave at
the United Nations, Gerasimov said. The Soviet leader announced a
reduction in Soviet forces by a half-million from its present 5.5
million.
   ``For health reasons, he decided to retire,'' Gerasimov told a
news conference in New York. The timing of the resignation ``was
merely a coincidence,'' he said.
   The marshal, a member of the Communist Party's policy-making
Central Committee whose military career spans 48 years, will remain
as an adviser to Gorbachev, Gerasimov said.
   Akhromeyev's resignation was not immediately reported by Soviet
media.
   No replacement has been named.
   Akhromeyev has argued that any cuts should be done simultaneously
with reductions by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The marshal traveled with Gorbachev to his Iceland and Washington
summits with President Reagan and visited the Pentagon in July to
meet with U.S. military officials.
   He did not accompany Gorbachev to the United States this week.
   Akhromeyev supervised military intelligence and strategic nuclear
weapons on the Soviet general staff before becoming its chief in
September 1984.
   He has been in the Soviet military since 1940.
   In August 1942, during some of the grimmest days of World War II
for the Soviet Union, he was discharged from the naval academy and
sent to the army front line. There he gained wide experience
infantry and tank troops and worked his way up the ranks.
   He became a full member of the Central Committee in 1983.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev decided to fly back to the
Soviet Union today ahead of schedule to direct relief efforts in the
wake of a devastating earthquake. ``When the people are suffering he
has to be there,'' his foreign minister said.
   President Reagan and President-elect George Bush expressed their
condolences for the tragedy during their meeting Wednesday with
Gorbachev on Governors Island in New York Harbor.
   Before the day was over, a stream of steadily worsening reports
from the southern Caucasus region of the Soviet Union had prompted
Gorbachev's decision to cut his visit to the United States short.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze called a sudden
news conference late Wednesday night to announce that Gorbachev was
canceling the remainder of his appointments in New York and dropping
plans to fly on to Cuba and Britain. He said Gorbachev would depart
for Moscow before noon EST.
   ``Despite the fact that all emergency measures are being taken
... Mr. Gorbachev believes when the people are suffering he has to
be there, he has to lead the efforts,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin called White House national
security adviser Lt. Gen. Colin Powell at about 11:30 p.m. and
``announced that Gorbachev was going back early because of the
earthquake,'' said presidential spokesman B.J. Cooper.
   The earthquake prompted an abrupt end to a tour that had already
won plaudits for the Soviet leader at the United Nations and praise
from Reagan and Bush following a two-hour meeting.
   The Soviet leader went on the diplomatic offensive in a speech to
the United Nations General Assembly, announcing that within three
years he would reduce the Soviet military machine by 10,000 tanks
and 500,000 troops. He also called for a Jan. 1 cease-fire in
Afghanistan, proposed a 100-year moratorium on Third World debt and
promised to prohibit political and religious persecution in his own
country.
   And he prodded Bush not to let the momentum of recent
arms-control achievements lapse. He said The Soviets are ready to
negotiate a dramatic cut in long-range nuclear weapons ``without
long pauses or backtracking.''
   Reagan and Bush applauded the spirit of his remarks, but were
cautious in responding. Bush said he had made it clear that ``we
needed some time.''
   Reagan returned to Washington and said in a speech to
conservatives that he was still an ``anti-communist,'' although he
said the Soviet troop reduction will be an ``important'' step
forward if it is carried out.
   With his diplomatic business accomplished, Gorbachev began what
was to have been two days of sightseeing in New York. But the fun
ended quickly as damage reports mounted from the Soviet earthquake.
   Shevardnadze said the quake hit Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia
in the Caucasus Mountains near the Soviet border with Turkey and
Iran, and that the epicenter was near the Armenian town of Leninakan.
   Armenia and Azerbaijan have been wracked for months by racial
strife, leading to the virtual declaration of martial law in that
region.
   The Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., said the quake occurred
Wednesday morning and registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. A quake
of that magnitude is capable of causing widespread, heavy damage.
   ``It's a terrible tragedy not only for the Armenian people but
for all the Soviet people,'' Shevardnadze said. He said precise
figures were not yet available but estimated that the quake had
killed thousands of people.
   He said some remote areas in the mountainous region had been cut
off from the outside world.
   Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov has been appointed head of a
special government commission to cope with the emergency and was in
the region, Shevardnadze said.
   Shevardnadze said Gorbachev's Havana and London visits would be
rescheduled.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's cancellation of a
three-nation tour to return to his earthquake-stricken nation
demonstrates the Soviet leader's ability to respond quickly to
events in a country he often complains is bound by its own
bureaucracy.
   Barely four hours before the president's decision was announced
at a surprise late-night news conference, chief Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov had dismissed any suggestion
Gorbachev might cut short his stay in New York.
   Although the spokesman acknowledged the situation was serious and
``a small village has practically disappeared from the face of the
earth,'' he told reporters that relief efforts were being handled
routinely by mobilization of the armed forces and physicians. He
noted it was a natural disaster and gave no indication any
presidential action was necessary or even under consideration.
   Gorbachev at the time was attending a star-studded reception at
the United Nations at the end of a day marked by his announcement of
a dramatic, military force reduction. Earlier in the day, he had bid
a friendly farewell to President Reagan, his four-time summit
partner, urged President-elect George Bush not to delay the
strengthening of U.S.-Soviet ties and toured New York for the first
time.
   A short time later, as other members of his entourage were going
to bed, Gorbachev instructed Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
to round up reporters for the announcement of his imminent return
home.
   Although such decisions are still reached in the secrecy of the
high Soviet counsels, it was apparent the remainder of Gorbachev's
highly publicized New York stay, including the opening of a trade
show, a stroll through Central Park and a tour of an art museum,
would have contrasted sharply with the stark pictures of disaster at
home.
   And Gorbachev, whose nationally televised personable chats with
constituents have set a new, modern style for a Soviet leader, could
hardly ignore the human tragedy. To continue on to Cuba and Britain
in the coming days almost certainly would have evoked comparison
with Reagan, who hesitated before breaking off a California vacation
to return to Washington after the Soviets shot down a Korean Air
Lines passenger jet in 1983.
   The Caucasus calamity took on an added dimension because it
struck a region that for months has been the scene of ethnic strife
between Armenians and Azerbaijanis and more recent nationalist
demonstrations in Shevardnadze's native Georgia.
   The unrest, which has exploded into fatal rioting in several
Azerbaijani cities and sparked massive demonstrations and general
strikes in Armenia, has prompted authorities to deploy troops and
tanks in the streets in some areas. Tens of thousands of refugees
have fled their homes in fear of pogroms.
   But despite the military presence, Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or openness, also has been evident in the region.
Authorities have tolerated dissent and criticism they once would
have crushed with brutal force.

<HEAD>President Replaces Top Political Leaders, Radical Students Go On
Rampage</HEAD>

   President Roh Tae-woo replaced the top
leaders of his political party today as he continued efforts to
sever ties to his authoritarian predecessor.
   Roh named veteran legislator Park Joon-kyu chairman of the
governing Democratic Justice Party. Park replaced Yoon Giel-joong in
the party's No. 2 post, with Roh remaining as party president.
   Park immediately promised to work with the opposition parties to
remove all vestiges of the authoritarian rule of former President
Chun Doo-hwan and ensure the introduction of full democracy.
   Roh replaced his cabinet Monday and is planning further shakeups
as part of efforts to defuse nationwide furor over demands for
action against Chun. He has promised to release political prisoners
and compensate people who suffered under Chun.
   About 200 radical students demanding Chun's arrest attacked the
governing party's office in the southern city of Taegu today, the
Yonhap news agency reported. No injuries were reported and police
arrested five protesters, the agency said.
   ``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo, who protects Chun
Doo-hwan,'' read placards carried by protesters.
   Park, who will oversee the daily workings of the party, said he
wanted to clear all questions about corruption and other abuses
under Chun by the end of the year. He urged the opposition to
cooperate with the government and said he would retain his post for
just one year to show his good intentions.
   A veteran lawmaker, Park was a top political leader in the 1970's
and is regarded as a moderate. He has headed the South Korean
delegation in recent talks with communist North Korea on easing
tension.
   As part of his promise to bring in more moderate officials, Roh
also removed Secretary-General Park Jun-byung, a retired army
general and noted hardliner.
   The two main opposition parties immediately criticized the
appointment of Park as party chairman, saying he had helped suppress
democracy in the past and his selection casts doubt on Roh's
commitment to reforms.
   Lee Sang-soo, spokesman of the Party for Peace and Democracy,
said, ``We get the impression that President Roh is retreating from
his promise that he will cut off ties with the Chun era.''
   The Reunification Democratic Party, the other main opposition
party, said Park's selection proved Roh wanted to maintain military
dictatorship.
   Roh asked the nation to forgive Chun after the former president
apologized to the nation Nov. 26 for abuses under his rule and went
into voluntary internal exile. But opposition parties say there can
be no question of pardon until Chun cooperates with a National
Assembly probe into his government.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, stepped down in February at the end of an eight-year term.
Roh, also a former general, won presidential elections last December.
   In other party changes announced by Roh, lawmaker Lee Jong-chan,
52, was installed as secretary-general. The party's chief policy
coordinator, Lee Seung-yun, 57, was switched to the vacant post of
chief party policy maker.
   Party officials said a further shakeup, involving lower party
posts, is expected within days.

   A music professor conducting a
60-voice performance of Handel's Messiah suffered a heart attack on
the podium and later died.
   Laurence Brown, 63, collapsed on the stage of Palm Beach Atlantic
College's auditorium Monday night and was taken to Good Samaritan
Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, said college spokeswoman
Lynn Van Lenten.
   ``The campus is devastated. He was well-loved by everybody,'' Ms.
Van Lenten said.
   Palm Beach Atlantic president Claude Rhea called him ``a
consummate musician, a great, great spirit.''
   Brown won national awards in piano by age 12 before going on to
study at the Juilliard School of Music.
   He became associate musical director at the St. Louis Opera in
1951 and later worked with the Teatro del Opera in Rome and theaters
in California and Florida.
   Brown was conductor for national Broadway touring companies of
such shows as ``Man of La Mancha'' and the final national tour of
``The King and I'' with Yul Brynner before becoming an associate
professor here.
   He is survived by two sons in Georgia. Arrangements were being
made for a memorial service at the school and a funeral, Ms. Van
Lenten said.

   New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu, whom
President-elect George Bush has named his chief of staff, hinted
that he may run for the Senate in 1990 or 1992.
   The suggestion came Wednesday during an interview with The Boston

what he planned to do with the $232,000 he has in political campaign
funds.
   ``I may run again. There are Senate seats coming up in this
state, and I am not going to shut my doors on running again at
all,'' he said.
   Both New Hampshire's senators are Republicans, as is Sununu.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey had said he will retire when his term ends
in 1990 _ two years before the 1992 presidential election _ but has
indicated in the last year he may seek re-election.
   ``The up-to-the minute thing is no decision,'' Humphrey's press

   East Side, West Side, and all around the town,
Mikhail Gorbachev sampled the sights of this ``unique city,'' twice
stepping out of his limousine to the delight of cheering New Yorkers
and the dismay of his security detail.
   ``Nobody booed at all; everybody cheered,'' said Mark Johansen,
30, after the Soviet president and his wife, Raisa, emerged from
their motorcade briefly Wednesday in the middle of Broadway in
Manhattan's Theater District.
   The Gorbachevs watched dusk spread over the twinkling city from
the top of the city's tallest building, the 110-story World Trade
Center, then sped uptown to the gaudy lights of Times Square as
crowds lining the streets cheered and applauded.
   ``The crowd was just going hysterical,'' said Joe Crawford, a
17-year-old high school student from Connecticut. ``It was really
exciting that he stopped here in front of us.''
   The Gorbachevs did it again minutes later uptown, when they
greeted onlookers outside that consumer cornucopia _ Bloomingdale's
department store.
   But after only one day of diplomacy and sightseeing, they cut
their visit short. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
announced late Wednesday that the Soviet leader would leave New York
a day early because of a catastrophic earthquake in three Soviet
republics.
   The cancelled plans today included a Soviet trade show and a
stroll through Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art with
his wife.
   The Gorbachevs _ and their 45-car motorcade _ toured Manhattan on
Wednesday after he addressed the United Nations General Assembly and
attended a luncheon with President Reagan and Vice President George
Bush on Governors Island.
   Following a short ferry voyage to Manhattan, the Communist Party
leader sped through the heart of U.S. capitalism to Wall Street and
the World Trade Center.
   The motorcade did not cause the massive gridlock feared by
officials and commuters, and provided normally unimpressed New
Yorkers and tourists with a novel diversion.
   ``I just saw Gorbachev,'' a messenger said after the motorcade
passed. ``I'll never wash my eyes again.''
   For Gorbachev, known for his Western-style politicking, the
feeling of excitement seemed mutual.
   ``We're very pleased by the fact that thousands of New Yorkers
have come out to see us,'' Gorbachev said on the building's
observation deck. ``We saw their faces, we saw their eyes, their
friendliness. ...
   ``Believe me, we appreciate this. We are grateful for this warm
hospitality.''
   Atop the Twin Towers, the Gorbachevs received gifts _ a Steuben
crystal sculpture of a bald eagle for Gorbachev and a bouquet of
roses and a silver bowel from Tiffany's for Mrs. Gorbachev.
   The Soviet president said it was ``nice to be here as a tourist
almost half a mile over New York.''
   ``What I particularly liked about the city, is this is a unique
city, a city of splendid identity and architecture,'' Gorbachev
said. ``You see different areas in the city that have their own
special identity.''
   As the sun set, the Gorbachevs gazed out the windows.
   ``Just beautiful. Just beautiful,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said.
   When the Empire State Building was pointed out, her husband
quipped that he had heard of it.
   Then they headed uptown.
   Night had fallen by the time they reached Times Square and its
dazzling illuminated signs. ``Welcome, General Secretary
Gorbachev,'' read one. ``Frisky Wives II,'' proclaimed a movie
theater marquee.
   The Gorbachevs' stop at 50th Street and Broadway lasted less than
a minute, much to the relief of jumpy guards who quickly surrounded
him. The Soviet first couple waved and raised locked hands over
their heads, and the crowd went wild.
   ``I waved to him, he waved back with a smile,'' said a tickled
Tina Russo, 16, of New Jersey.
   ``He surprised us,'' said Chief of Department Robert J. Johnson,
the city's highest ranking uniformed police officer. When the
Gorbachevs' limo stopped, the advance part of his police escort
continued along Broadway, but made a quick U-turn and returned when
they realized what had happened.
   The motorcade continued uptown and east to Bloomie's and the
Gorbachevs' second impromptu stop before arriving at the Soviet
Mission.
   While her husband gave his U.N. speech and met with Reagan and
Bush, Mrs. Gorbachev had lunch with Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush at
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's East Side residence.
   The stylish Soviet first lady later went to Estee Lauder Inc.'s
offices near Central Park, where she sampled perfume and examined
the company's selection of cosmetics.
   ``I am happy to be in the city you call the Big Apple,'' she said
at the luncheon, speaking through an interpreter.

<HEAD>Researchers Doubt Greenhouse Effect Underway; Dispute Link To 1988
Drought</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Claims that the greenhouse effect already is
warming Earth's climate are under attack by researchers who say the
theory's advocates are ``like Chicken Little.''
   William Kellogg went undefended Wednesday during the American
Geophysical Union's fall meeting when he asserted ``we are in the
grips of an irreversible global change'' that has already started to
warm the atmosphere.
   ``I liken my position to being like Daniel in the lions' den,''
said Kellogg, a retired atmospheric scientist from the National
Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
   ``I think you're more like Chicken Little,'' replied retired
climatologist Arnold Court, of California State University,
Northridge.
   ``There's going to be a greenhouse effect, but that doesn't say
where or when it's going to happen. I'm denying it's here now,''
said meteorologist Jerome Namias, who headed the National Weather
Service's extended forecast division for 30 years.
   The anticipated warming of the climate by carbon dioxide and
other pollutants _ which trap heat from the sun like glass in a
greenhouse _ ``is a very convenient scapegoat'' for the drought that
baked much of the nation this summer, but there is no evidence it
caused the drought, said Namias, now with the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography.
   Many climatologists predict the greenhouse effect will warm the
Earth's climate by 4 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit by about 2050,
increasing total precipitation but making some areas drier, and also
perhaps melting enough polar ice to raise sea levels and flood some
coastal areas. But they disagree on whether the phenomenon is under
way.
   Kellogg said records kept by the University of East Anglia in
Norwich, England, show average global temperatures rose by 1.1 to
1.4 degrees from 1880 to 1986, consistent with the theory that
carbon dixoide from increased burning of fossil fuels has warmed the
Earth since the industrial revolution.
   Kevin Trenberth, a researcher at the Boulder center, said
temperature measurements tend to be made in cities, which got warmer
due to rapid growth.
   William Sprigg, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's climate office in Rockville, Md., said, ``The case
has not been made that greenhouse gases explain what we see.''
   Namias said his study shows this year's drought fit the pattern
of many earlier dry periods and had many causes. The causes included
complex changes in interacting patterns of the jet stream and other
winds, ocean and air temperatures, atmospheric pressure and soil
moisture, all of which ``explain what went on quite adequately
without the greenhouse effect,'' he said.
   The drought has been blamed for at least $12.8 billion in U.S.
agricultural losses.
   In June, experts told a congressional committee that rising
temperatures worldwide, including four record-breaking warm years
this decade, were caused by a buildup of greenhouse gases.
   James Hansen, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration
climatologist, told the panel, ``The evidence is pretty strong that
the greenhouse effect is here'' and the 1988 drought and heat wave
were examples of what would happen more frequently in the future.
   ``The frequency of droughts in the United States over the past
century suggests that the drought of 1988 cannot be distinguished
from the normal climate variability of the past century,'' said Tom
Karl, of NOAA's Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C.
   Namias emphasized the summertime drought over much of the nation
is different than the wintertime drought that has plagued the West
Coast since 1986. Namias expects heavy rains this winter in
Washington state, Oregon and Northern California, but said so far,
they haven't materialized.

   Raisa Gorbachev, offering her own version of
glasnost to crowds of admiring New Yorkers, stopped to bask in their
applause and returned the favor with warm words for Americans and
their ``beautiful'' city.
   Until a tragedy back home shortened her visit, the fashionably
dressed Soviet first lady appeared to enjoy playing at diplomacy and
tourism in a brisk sweep through Gotham on Wednesday.
   Following a luncheon with Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush, the wife
of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev visited the headquarters of the
Estee Lauder cosmetics firm, where she paused outside her limousine
to smile and acknowledge the waving crowd.
   ``What message I would like to say to the Americans is that I'm
sincerely happy to have this opportunity to see this beautiful
city,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said through an interpreter. ``But even more
than this, I am happy to have an opportunity to meet the Americans.''
   Onlookers continued to call her name when she went inside for a
private tour.
   ``She loved them (the spectators), the cheers, the applause,''
said Leonard Lauder, president and chief executive officer of Estee
Lauder. ``She's never seen anything like it. She's never seen a city
like this anywhere, where she's been so well received.''
   That opportunity was cut short when her husband decided he had to
leave New York a day early because of a devastating earthquake in
three Soviet republics.
   ``I've been wanting to see Raisa Gorbachev forever, it seems,''
said onlooker Phyllis Parker, 47, of Rochester. ``When I was a very
young girl in Blackfoot, Idaho, everybody disliked Russia for no
reason, and I got to know them and love them (through her own
studies).''
   ``My father was an atomic scientist. I wanted peace. This is a
very emotional time for me,'' she added.
   Inside, Mrs. Gorbachev, who ``has gorgeous skin,'' was shown
baskets of fragrances and asked to be sprayed with a perfume called
``Beautiful,'' said Evelyn Lauder, corporate vice president.
   ``The point really was that it's a family business, which is so
different from the U.S.S.R.,'' said Mrs. Lauder, who is founder
Estee Lauder's daughter-in-law.
   Mrs. Gorbachev's security team emerged bearing armloads of gifts
wrapped in gold foil with red ribbons, including cosmetics and
fragrances, two ``I Love New York'' T-shirts, a crystal apple and
toys for the Gorbachev grandchildren.
   In the evening, she attended a U.N. reception after a late
afternoon motorcade tour of the city with her husband, who addressed
the United Nations and met with President Reagan and President-Elect
Bush for lunch.
   Estee Lauder had earlier attended the luncheon with Mrs.
Gorbachev, Mrs. Reagan, future first lady Mrs. Bush and others.
   ``I was thrilled and I had never met her (Mrs. Gorbachev) _
charming,'' said Ms. Lauder, who wore a purple outfit with a diamond
brooch.
   Mrs. Gorbachev appeared at the luncheon in a navy blue suit,
green blouse and black brooch _ a change from the grey, pinstriped
suit she wore at the United Nations that morning. Mrs. Reagan chose
a rust-colored jacket and brown skirt with flecks of rust; Mrs. Bush
wore a mauve and black checked suit.
   A small crowd watched intently as the women stepped out of
limousines to enter the townhouse where the luncheon was given by
Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the United Nations
secretary-general.
   Mrs. Gorbachev arrived shortly after Mrs. Bush and five minutes
before Mrs. Reagan.
   ``I'm nosy _ that's why I'm here in the first place,'' said
Kathleen Donnelly of Manhattan, a private nurse who works in the
neighborhood.

   Those who grew up with Roy Orbison never
doubted the musical ability that would carry him to rock 'n' roll
fame.
   ``I thought early on that Roy was the one of us that really had
the talent,'' said Charlie Evans, who played bass fiddle in a high
school band with Orbison. ``The rest of us were just hang-alongs.
   ``Roy would think and live and breathe music.''
   Orbison, whose piercing voice on such early 1960s hits as ``Oh,
Pretty Woman'' and ``Cryin''' made him a rock legend, died of a
heart attack late Tuesday in Hendersonville, Tenn. He was 52.
   Orbison came with his family to this West Texas oil town of 1,200
during the oil boom of the 1940s. His father, Orvie Lee, worked in
the Permian Basin oil fields but found time to teach his son to play
the guitar at age 6.
   Some here can still remember the singer-songwriter when he was a
skinny 11-year-old playing his guitar outside the drugstore for
small change.
   In high school, Orbison and some friends formed the Wink
Westerners, which played country and Western music at school dances
and bars and later had a radio and television show sponsored by a
furniture store in nearby Odessa.
   Evans recalled the group's first trip outside Texas, when they
traveled to Chicago as the campaign band for a Wink resident who was
running for a national Lions Club office.
   ``That was the first time any of us had been to the big city,''
he said. ``We had never seen a subway.''
   The group changed its name to the Teen Kings after its five
members graduated and played a newer kind of music: rock 'n' roll.
   After a trip to Nashville and a national tour, ``They came back
to Wink and all of them were driving Cadillacs,'' said John Paul
Pitts, a former Wink resident who lived one house away from Orbison.
   ``I used to come out of my house and see Roy in the back seat of
his car, practicing the guitar because his house was so small,''
said Pitts, who wore Orbison's sport coat for his high school
graduation because he didn't own one.
   Town officials last year renamed the street where the singer had
lived Roy Orbison Drive, although the shotgun house his family
occupied is no longer standing.
   Orbison's musical ambition was evinced in the verse beneath his
senior picture in his 1954 high school yearbook: ``To lead a Western
band _ Is his after school wish _ And of course to marry _ A
beautiful dish.''
   Orbison last visited West Texas for an Oil Aid concert in Midland
last year to benefit economically distressed oilfield workers.
   ``I never thought that success changed him,'' said Bill Beckham,
publisher of The Wink Bulletin and the Winkler County News, who
attended high school with Orbison. ``Wink was always home for Roy
even though he had not been there for many years.''

   An off-duty usher exploring old rooms at
Hollywood's landmark Egyptian Theater fell 40 feet to his death when
a section of ceiling caved in, authorities said.
   Erick Pineda, 22, of Los Angeles, had gone to the auditorium
Tuesday on his day off to get passes to other Hollywood Boulevard
theaters, said Detective Glen Day.
   Apparently Pineda and a friend decided to explore the many rooms
leading to the theater's roof so that they could view the
auditorium's ornate ceiling, Day said.
   ``It's like the `Phantom of the Opera' up there,'' he said,
describing the rooms as ``old, dark, dank.''
   Most of the room's floors are concrete, but Pineda apparently
stepped on a section consisting only of acoustic tiles and fell to
the main theater, which was empty.
   The accident occurred shortly after 7 p.m., police said.
   Pineda was pronounced dead at the scene.

<TEXT>
   Terrence Lore Smith, author of the
best-selling novel ``The Thief Who Came To Dinner,'' was killed in a
traffic accident on an icy road. He was 46.
   Smith, who died Wednesday, wrote eight mystery novels. The most
famous, ``The Thief Who Came To Dinner,'' was completed in 1969 and
was published by Doubleday and Pocket Books. It reached No. 7 on a
national best-seller list and was made into a movie that starred
Ryan O'Neill.
   He also wrote ``The Looking Glass Murders,'' ``Murder Behind
Closed Doors,'' ``Yours Truly, From Hell,'' ``The Money War,'' ``The
Devil and Webster Daniels,'' ``Grownups and Lovers,'' and ``Who
Killed the Pie Man?''
   He co-authored ``Different Drums'' with his father, Charles
Merrill Smith, who died in February 1985.
   Smith was born Oct. 27, 1942, in Freeport, Ill. He lived in
Bloomington, Ill., until he moved to Colorado Springs in 1980. He
recently moved to Woodland Park.
   Smith had worked for about a year as a courier for the Pikes Peak
Library District. He died while driving a library district van on an
icy road. The van went out of control and was struck by another
vehicle, authorities said.
   ``He was a very, very capable and dear employee _ very well
liked,'' said Bernard Margolis, director of the library district.
``He was very appreciated by his colleagues. ...
   ``He liked people, he liked the library and he liked the world of
books.''
   Before joining the staff, Smith worked as a counselor at the
Brockhurst Ranch and the ARK, two alcoholic rehabilitation centers
in Green Mountain Falls. He was a state-certified drug and alcohol
counselor.
   Smith was a member of the Mystery Writers Guild of America.
   He married Harriet Hahn Smith on March 20, 1971, in Middletown,
N.Y. She is a columnist and deputy features editor of the Colorado
Springs Gazette Telegraph.
   Smith is survived by his wife; his mother, Mary Lore Smith of
Bloomington; a sister and four daughters.
   Funeral services were incomplete.

   Most New Yorkers found the best view of the visit
by Mikhail Gorbachev on television.
   But being there, and being part of history, made a little
difficulty worth the effort for some residents of the traffic-choked
city.
   The Soviet leader's tour of Manhattan on Wednesday consisted
mainly of a speeding 45-car motorcade with flashing lights and
screaming sirens, punctuated by two stops during which Gorbachev
delighted crowds by emerging from his limousine.
   The 75-minute tour _ which followed Gorbachev's speech to the
United Nations and lunch with President Reagan and President-Elect
Bush _ will form some of the most lasting images of a trip cut short
by a severe earthquake in the Soviet south.
   Most were glad to see Gorbachev visiting the city, but for others
it either did not live up to their expectations or made things worse
during the hectic Christmas shopping season.
   ``That was it?'' said Joan Swift, as the limousines bearing
Gorbachev and his entourage sped off from the United Nations, where
she had waited more than an hour on Wednesday ``to just wave.''
   Some sidewalk vendors found the visit good for business. But
Santa Clauses complained of being moved from such key locations as
the door to the New York Stock Exchange to prepare for the Gorbachev
caravan.
   ``Gorby gridlock'' _ the traffic jams predicted for the motorcade
_ was never as bad as the most dire predictions. But that didn't
soothe the tempers of those who did bring their cars into midtown
and found evening rush hour worse than normal.
   The visit to Lower Manhattan at the start of the afternoon rush
hour left some motorists in their cars for more than an hour. The
Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel was also closed from 4:35 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
backing cars up several miles on both sides.
   Staten Island Ferry schedules were disrupted during the afternoon
as the Soviet party returned from the meeting on Governors Island.
And some buses couldn't run their normal routes with streets closed.
   In Times Square, police wouldn't let pedestrians through for
about a half-hour before the motorcade passed.
   ``I can't cross the street. I'm just trapped,'' said Ishmael
Roberts, who works in an office building in Times Square and wanted
to catch a bus home.
   Gorbachev's motorcade also closed Fifth Avenue for about an hour,
drawing a ``bah humbug'' from a Santa-suited bell ringer for the
Volunteers of America.
   ``It was bad for business,'' said James Robertson. ``Everything
was blocked off. It slowed down the donations.''
   Gorbachev's day also included a speech at the United Nations,
lunch with President Reagan and President-elect George Bush on
Governors Island, and a stop at the World Trade Center.
   While advocates for the homeless said the police had told the
homeless to leave the U.N. area _ a charge police deny _ officials
couldn't stop some 1,000 demonstrators from massing outside the U.N.
to remind Gorbachev of problems ranging from the plight of Soviet
Jews to unrest in Soviet Armenia. Fifty-six protesters were arrested.
   But most of the thousands who lined Gorbachev's motorcade route
were friendly, and the feeling of good will was not lost on the
Soviet leader.
   ``We're very pleased by the fact that thousands of New Yorkers
have come out to see us,'' he said at the World Trade Center. ``We
saw their faces, we saw their eyes, their friendliness.''

   Share prices fell sharply on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today, while the U.S. dollar rose moderately against the
Japanese yen following its upward trend in New York.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which jumped
beyond the 30,000-point mark for the first time Wednesday, plunged
291.92 points or 0.97 percent to finish trading at 29,758.90. The
index dropped almost 200 points in early trading and continued to
move lower.
   The dollar closed at 123.02 yen, up 0.59 yen from Wednesday's
close of 122.43 yen. The currency opened higher at 123.40 yen, but
gradually fell while fluctuating between 122.85-123.48 yen.
   The dollar's finish was higher than the 123-yen mark for the
first time since Nov. 16 when it closed at 123.54 yen.
   Stock traders attributed the Nikkei's drop today largely to
profit-taking and the higher dollar in the currency market.
   Many traders, who bought cheaper issues in spot trading and sold
issues in futures trading to turn profits Wednesday, were mainly
selling in spot trading today, pushing prices lower, said an analyst
with Nomura Securities.
   A dealer with a major securities firm said many institutional
investors were either sitting on the sidelines or selling issues for
profit-taking after Wednesday's big gain.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at a moderate
900 million shares.
   On the foreign exchange market, traders said the dollar's rise
followed sharp gains overnight in overseas markets after Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev announced at the United Nations that he
would cut Soviet troop strength by 500,000 and reduce the number of
its conventional armaments.
   On Wednesday, the dollar closed at 123.63 yen in New York and at
123.40-123.50 yen in London.
   ``The market took the Soviet move as a helping hand for the
United States toward cutting its huge fiscal deficits'' by easing
U.S. defense obligations, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   There was little movement in Tokyo after the market opened, said
Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Although the dollar in New York sharply rose following news of
a possible Soviet arms reduction in Europe, players in Tokyo don't
believe the dollar's uptrend will continue much longer,'' she said.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly intervened in the market to support
the dollar before the close of Tokyo trading, buying dollars at
around 122.90 yen, currency dealers said.

<HEAD>Ben Stewart Defeats Bob Stewart In Mayoral Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNION POINT, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen votes were enough to re-elect
the mayor over his fiercest opposition _ his brother, an 8-year City
Council veteran.
   Incumbent Ben Stewart won his fifth term as mayor in an election
Wednesday in which 322 persons, or 41 percent of the east-central
Georgia city's 778 voters, went to the polls.
   Stewart defeated his brother, Bob Stewart, 168-154.
   Both Stewarts said they were glad the race between them had come
to an end.
   ``I'm relieved it's over, I'm sorry the situation developed in
the first place,'' said the 39-year-old mayor.
   ``That's the way it goes. It was a close race,'' said Bob
Stewart, 33, adding, ``I didn't want it to happen. I'm glad things
are over.''
   The Stewarts were the only candidates in the non-partisan race.
   During the past few months, published reports said the rivalry
between the Stewarts started out as a feud over the
multimillion-dollar will of their father, the late John Ben Stewart,
who served as mayor from 1967 to 1979. The father was killed in a
automobile accident on Dec. 27, 1987.
   Several months ago, Bob Stewart said he filed a lawsuit against
his brother concerning a partnership in a business venture.
   ``It has nothing to do with the will. Nobody's contesting the
will that I know of,'' he said.
   Bob Stewart said his brother, who lost a bid for a state House
seat, told him he did not intend to seek re-election. Both were
surprised to see each other when they showed up on the first day of
qualifying for the $100-a-month job.
   ``I wanted to be the one to replace him,'' Bob said. ``I didn't
run a race against my brother. He ran against me. I announced
first.''
   In 1980, Bob Stewart, at age 25, was the youngest Union Point
council member ever to be elected.
   Since he could not run for the mayor's office and a council post,
Bob Stewart said his loss will mean devoting his energies into his
insurance agency.
   Ben Stewart, who is in the finance business, said his brother
never asked him if he planned to run.
   ``I qualified first and it was well-known that I was running,''
he said.
   The sibling rivalry fueled much talk among the town's 1,600
residents.
   `A lot of people are friends of both of us, and this has made it
hard,'' said Bob Stewart.
   The contest was ``a very sad, regrettable, unfortunate
situation,'' Ben Stewart said.

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in moderate trading this morning in
Europe as the foreign exchange market calmed after a sharp rally
Wednesday on news that Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged to reduce the
Soviet Union's armed forces.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Traders said the dollar was clearly overbought on Wednesday
following Gorbachev's speech at the United Nations.
   Traders said news that Gorbachev had to cut short his visit to
New York and return to the Soviet Union due to a major earthquake in
Armenia caused some confusion in the market today and took some
strength out of the U.S. currency.
   They said the dollar was likely to remain in a narrow range
during the day.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.59 yen to a closing 123.02 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 122.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.7505 West German marks, down from 1.7588
   _1.4720 Swiss francs, down from 1.4790
   _5.9755 French francs, down from 6.0025
   _1.9752 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9675
   _1,289.50 Italian lire, down from 1,290.75
   _1.1963 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1995
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8480, from $1.8425
Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $423.25 a troy ounce, up
from $422.95 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $423.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $423.10, down from $423.50 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.78 to close at a bid $424.88.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.18 a troy ounce,
up from Wednesday's $6.14.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Releases Opposition Leaders Jailed Since July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODOLFO GARCIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GRANADA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government has
freed the last 10 opposition leaders incarcerated since an
anti-government rally was forcefully broken up five months ago by
riot police.
   Two other leaders of the July 10 demonstration in Nadaime, 27
miles south of the capital Managua, were released last month because
of poor health.
   The day after the protest, the government expelled U.S.
Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other American diplomats in
Managua. It also closed the opposition newspaper, La Prensa, and the
official Roman Catholic radio station.
   Washington responded by expelling Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos
Tunnermann and seven other Nicaraguan diplomats in Washington.
   The Nicaraguan government alleged Melton was using the U.S.
Embassy to direct a ``conspiracy'' against the government and that
the media were ``orchestrating'' the ambassador's plan.
   The Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed rebels, known as
the Contras, agreed March 21 to suspend offensive operations, but
talks aimed at a permanent end to the 7-year war are at an impasse.
   One leader released Wednesday, Carlos Huembes, said as he left
government custody, ``The only alternative in Nicaragua is the civic
fight.'' He said imprisonment had not intimidated him.
   A few family members and foreign correspondents were on hand when
the prisoners were released. Pro-government reporters did not attend.
   Suspended jail sentences for Huembes and Roger Guevara, of the
Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate; Agustin Jarquin of the Social
Christian Party; and Miriam Arguello of the Nicaraguan Conservative
Party were based on charges that included causing public harm,
inciting a disturbance and illegal assembly.
   Arguello and Jarquin were released Nov. 15.
   The other demonstrators released Wednesday were given 18-month
sentences.
   The judge issued the order of conditional freedom because, ``They
(the opposition leaders) don't have previous criminal records, they
have good conduct records and their re-entry into society is not a
threat.''
   However, during the duration of their sentences, they will not be
allowed to leave the country and political activities in Nicaragua
will be limited.
   Defense attorneys appealed the sentence, saying it was unclear,
and paid fines for their clients' release.
   Guevara, for example, was forced to pay $406 for vehicle damage
that occurred during the demonstration.
   Miriam Arguello called the punishment ``political revenge'' and
``a judicial abberation.''

   Hurricane-force Santa Ana winds fanned fires and forced hundreds
of evacuations in Southern California today after collapsing a
three-story apartment project, blowing the roofs off homes and
causing power outages, officials said.
   In Colorado, a wintry storm dumped up to 15 inches of snow
Wednesday, causing rush-hour traffic jams, dozens of accidents and
the deaths of best-selling novelist Terrence Smith and another
motorist, authorities said.
   Snow continued falling today in Colorado, as well as in western
Texas, New Mexico and parts of Arizona.
   No serious injuries were reported in Southern California due to
the hot, desert Santa Ana winds, which are expected to continue
through Friday.
   A fire that broke out at a paper company in Baldwin, Calif.,
shortly after midnight Wednesday quickly spread to a lumberyard and
at least three homes as winds gusted to 75 mph, and was burning out
of control early today, said firefighter Clarence Gardner.
   An undetermined number of people were evacuated from their homes
in the community 20 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles,
officials said.
   Firefighters from about 25 engine companies battled the blaze,
Gardner said.
   Hundreds of West Los Angeles residents were evacuated late
Wednesday when the wind spread embers from a burning apartment house
project to a nearby complex, said fire department spokesman Greg
Acevedo.
   The fire raged for nearly two hours, displacing occupants of the
four-story building as flames climbed hundreds of feet into the air.
   Two National Guardsmen who were guarding fire vehicles parked
nearby suffered smoke inhalation and were taken to a hospital,
Acevedo said.
   The winds knocked out power during the night to 3,000 customers
in the San Fernando Valley and to 38,000 homes in the foothills
north of Los Angeles from La Crescenta to Rancho Cucamonga about 30
miles east of downtown.
   Rancho Cucamonga, where winds were clocked at 80 mph, appeared to
be the hardest hit Wednesday.The winds knocked down a three-story
apartment building under construction and blew the roofs off at
least two homes, officials said.
   ``I always wanted a room with a skylight,'' Dolores Salazar said
ruefully as she regarded the damage to her home.
   Small fires were reported throughout the night in Rancho
Cucamonga, but all were controlled, said city emergency services
coordinator Marti Higgins.
   Wind-fanned flames in Hollywood gutted a two-story home and
leaped to a neighboring residence Wednesday, said Acevedo.
   The gusts blew a tree onto a car in the Orange County city of
Santa Ana, and knocked over a 30-foot motor home on the Foothill
Freeway near San Dimas, causing a traffic jam.
   The Colorado storm was subsiding in most areas today after
leaving 15 inches of snow west of Fort Collins, 4 inches in Colorado
Springs and Denver and 2 inches in Pueblo.
   Roads that were wet Wednesday morning were sheets of ice by
afternoon before being covered by snow, producing evening rush-hour
traffic jams in the Denver area, Boulder and Fort Collins.
   ``It's a total mess everywhere,'' said Denver police Sgt. Milt
Gras.
   Authorities warned driving conditions would be no better today.
   Smith, 46, of Woodland Park and a 42-year-old Woodmoor woman were
killed in separate accidents, authorities said. Smith, author of
``The Thief Who Came To Dinner'' and several other novels, died when
his van spun on ice on U.S. 24 and hit a car.
   There were 38 accidents in Fort Collins alone by 8 p.m., and in
Denver motorists were asked to report minor crack-ups later.

<HEAD>Palestinian Shot In Heart By Soldiers, Division Over Arafat
Statement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Arab teen-ager was
fatally shot in the heart today in a clash with soldiers as
Palestinians marked with a general strike the first anniversary of
their uprising against Israeli rule.
   Meanwhile, splits emerged among both Palestinians and Israelis
over PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's statement recognizing the
existence of Israel.
   Yussef Mohammed Sbaith, 17, died of a bullet wound in the heart
after soldiers opened fire on stone-throwing youths in the West Bank
village of Kafr Rai, according to officials at a hospital in nearby
Jenin.
   The army said it was checking the reported fatality, which would
be the 320th Palestinian death since the uprising began Dec. 8
against Israel's 21-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Eleven Israelis also have died.
   Palestinians responded to today's call for a two-day general
strike by shutting down stores and other businesses throughout the
occupied lands, which are home to 1.5 million Palestinians and were
sized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
   The army imposed curfews on all eight Palestinian refugee camps
in the Gaza Strip, confining more than 250,000 people to their homes
indefinitely.
   Residents of Gaza City's Shejayeh section said Israeli troops
also ordered a curfew there over loudspeakers and called on men 16
to 35 to report to a neighborhood courtyard.
   One resident said the move came after a firebomb was thrown at an
Israeli jeep, one of dozens of Israeli military vehicles seen on the
otherwise deserted streets.
   In the West Bank cities of Bethlehem and Nablus, troops ordered
residents out of their houses to paint over fresh graffiti and
forced teen-agers to tear down outlawed Palestinian flags.
   Many slogans mirrored differences over Arafat's statement and the
recent declaration of independence in Algeria by the PLO's
parliament-in-exile that implicitly recognized Israel.
   ``What do you want, Israel, after recognition?'' said one slogan
in Bethlehem signed by Arafat's mainstream PLO faction Fatah.
   Opposite views appeared in graffiti signed by the fundamentalist
Moslem group Hamas, or Zeal, and the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist PLO faction.
   ``No concessions, not even an inch of Palestine,'' was scrawled
on a wall in Nablus.
   ``Yes to holy war against the enemy,'' declared another, painted
in traditional Islamic green, on one Bethlehem wall.
   Israelis also disagreed in their reaction to Arafat's latest
statement issued in Stockholm on Wednesday that called for peace
negotiations and accepted Israel's existence.
   Asked to clarify the statement, Arafat replied: ``This was clear
in resolutions adopted in the last session of our Palestine National
Council where we said clearly there are two states in Palestine, the
Palestinian state and the Jewish state, Israel. ... Is this now
clear enough?''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres responded by laying down conditions
for recognizing the PLO.
   He said the PLO would have to drop conditions attached to
accepting U.N. Resolution 242, stop terrorism, including violent
anti-Israeli resistance in the uprising, and accept Israel's right
to live in peace.
   The U.N. resolution calls for Israeli withdrawal from lands
occupied in the 1967 Middle East war and for the right of all states
in the region to have secure borders.
   Peres, however, said he did not believe Arafat met his conditions
and referred to the PLO leader's latest moves as ``an exercise in
public relations.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejected Arafat's statement
totally. ``I don't see, and I don't think I ever will see, any real
change, because they (the PLO) were established in the name of
destroying Israel,'' he said on Israel television.
   Avi Pazner, a close adviser to Shamir, said Arafat should disband
the PLO if he really recognizes Israel because the organization was
created to destroy the Jewish state.
   ``He should clear the way for moderate Palestinians to emerge,''
he said.
   Ran Cohen, a leader of the small, left-wing Citizens' Rights
Movement, welcomed Arafat's statement, saying: ``I think rational
politicians should bless the process and ask how we can advance it.''

   It's not everyone who gets a watch repaired at
Tiffany's, or Secret Service protection while they're waiting.
Future first lady Barbara Bush does.
   Mrs. Bush surprised Christmas shoppers Wednesday with a stop at
the famed jewelers before her luncheon meeting with first ladies
Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev.
   Secret service agents stationed in front of Tiffany's on Fifth
Avenue first drew a crowd as Mrs. Bush browsed inside.
   ``We're not shopping,'' she called out with a smile as customers
stopped to wish her well. Mrs. Bush made a quick stop at the store
to have her watch repaired, a store spokeswoman said.
   She engaged in small talk with those who stopped to congratulate
her on her husband George's election victory and signed an autograph
for Joshua Steinberg, 9, of Brooklyn.
   ``Now you all go shop,'' Mrs. Bush joked to the crowd.

   The extra police on the streets for the visit of
Mikhail Gorbachev helped lead to the capture of four men who
allegedly robbed a Brooklyn bank and killed a teller, authorities
said.
   ``They were pretty dumb,'' said police Officer Scott O'Brien.
``There were all kinds of police, Secret Service and FBI in the area
because of the Gorby visit.''
   During the course of the robbery at the Bowery Savings Bank on
Wednesday, a teller, Patricia Interdonato, 29, was shot in the chest
``because she didn't move fast enough,'' said Sgt. Edward Burns said.
   Interdonato, who lived in Brooklyn, died later at Methodist
Hospital, he said.
   The four suspects escaped in the car, but a nearby police patrol
car soon caught up with them, Burns said.
   ``We were on the presidential detail ... when we heard the job on
our radio,'' said O'Brien, who helped nab the suspects.
   The four alleged robbers, who all live in Brooklyn, were charged
with murder, robbery, criminal possession of a deadly weapon and
criminal possession of stolen property, Burns said.
   Police recovered $165,000 in cash, a police radio, a radio
scanner and three handguns, he said.

   Stanford, 38, gave security officers a portrait of Gorbachev, a
box of flowers for Raisa and a pencil drawing of the Soviet leader,
President Reagan and Vice President Bush.
   The agents, he said hopefully, ``were going to try to get the

   Gorbachev can keep the portrait, he said.
   ``I wanted to be here to be a part of this. I came down here to
give him the painting, to deliver the flowers, and maybe take home a

   Stanford seemed convinced that the Soviet leader would sign the
drawing and return it before his hurried departure today. ``I know
he's going to see it.''

<HEAD>Cold Air Sweeps Snow Through the Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold air mass swept down through the nation's midsection today,
dumping snow in Colorado, western Texas, New Mexico and parts of
Arizona, while thunderstorms struck northeast Texas.
   In Colorado, more than 12 inches of snow was measured around
Boulder, and the Denver area had between 4 and 7 inches on the
ground Wednesday evening. Colorado Springs had from 3 to 5 inches of
snow.
   Snow accumulated on some roads in the Texas Panhandle and
northern New Mexico. Rain changed to snow as far south as Roswell,
N.M., and across portions of Oklahoma and northern Arkansas.
   The heaviest snow was expected in the mountains of southern New
Mexico and southwest Texas.
   In the middle Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico, including the
Albuquerque area, winds gusted to 45 mph late Wednesday and were
expected to exceed 60 mph in some areas.
   Early today, thunderstorms and heavy rain hit portions of
northeast Texas. A flash flood watch was in effect this morning.
Small hail was reported from a thunderstorm in Leon County, Texas.
   Rain and thunderstorms also reached into much of Oklahoma,
Arkansas and northwest Louisiana.
   In the Northeast, light snow and freezing drizzle fell through
parts of Vermont and the Adirondacks of northeastern New York. Many
roads were reported icy, including interstate highways.
   Clear skies prevailed across the southeastern states.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
eastern two- thirds of Texas to eastern Oklahoma, the lower
Mississippi Valley and the Tennessee Valley; snow through western
Oklahoma, western Texas and much of New Mexico; rain scattered
through southeast Arizona; snow across Michigan; and high winds in
Southern California.
   High temperatures were forecast in the teens from eastern Montana

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz met
today with NATO allies to try to persuade them to insist on further
cutbacks in Soviet troops in Europe beyond the 50,000 Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has offered to withdraw from East Germany, Czechoslovakia
and Hungary.
   In his farewell meeting with the 15 foreign ministers, Shultz
hoped to keep the allies focused on the 2-to-1 manpower edge U.S.
officials say the Warsaw Pact still enjoys.
   ``I'm not trying to suggest this decision should be sniffed at,''
a senior aide to Shultz said of the unilateral cutback offer
Gorbachev made Wednesday in a U.N. speech in New York.
   But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, contrasted
the Soviet leader's decision to withdraw six tank divisions from the
three East European countries with the 20 divisions stationed in
East Germany alone. And, the official said, the 500,000 troops
Gorbachev offered to demobilize are only a fraction of the 5.5
million-man Red Army.
   Shultz called the proposal a ``welcome and significant step.''
But Gorbachev's appeal for ``certain steps soon'' by the West in
return apparently will not be answered.
   The Reagan administration, which has only 6{ weeks left in
office, does not intend to bring home any of the 335,000 U.S. troops
in Western Europe in response to the Soviet leader's move, U.S.
officials said.
   Despite the Soviet manpower edge, several American analysts have
called for a partial U.S. withdrawal. One reason, they suggest, is
to have the allies assume a larger share of the burden of defending
Western Europe.
   Instead, the United States and its allies are aiming at joint
negotiations early next year with the Warsaw Pact on a mutual
reduction in non-nuclear forces and tanks across the vast expanse of
Europe.
   The Reagan administration contends the Soviet-led alliance has a
3-to-1 advantage in tanks over the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Today, NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner opened the two-day
meeting by calling the Soviet decision to make unilateral troop cuts
in Eastern Europe an ``encouraging development which we welcome.''
   But, he said, ``the steps announced ... reduce, but clearly do
not eliminate Soviet superiority and do not establish a stable
balance.''
   ``If carried out,'' he said, ``they would undoubtedly be an
important step in the right direction and we will be looking forward
to their implementation.
   ``If this step means that the Soviet Union is coming to accept
the reality that their conventional superiority constitutes the
principal threat to stability and security in Europe, then we would
find (the) announcement still more encouraging,'' he said.
   Woerner said the allies were seeking ``binding and verifiable
agreements which would eliminate the present conventional
asymmetries.''
   U.S. officials had said reporting on Gorbachev's luncheon meeting
Wednesday in New York with President Reagan and President-elect Bush
was the ``lead item'' on Shultz's NATO agenda.
   Shultz, in his final session with the Western foreign ministers
before retiring, also scheduled a report on developments in Eastern
Europe and steps taken by the Soviet Union on human rights.
   In contrast to their cool reaction to Gorbachev's proposal to
restructure the Soviet armed forces, U.S. officials were
enthusiastic about the Soviet leader's promise to institute legal
reforms and take up every case in which the United States claims
political prisoners are being detained.
   Disputing Gorbachev, Shultz said there are still political
prisoners in the Soviet Union. But, he said, ``There have been a
great many released.''
   These and other steps taken by the Soviets are close to meeting
all U.S. demands before wrapping up a review in Vienna of the 1975
Helsinki agreement.
   In that 35-nation accord, the Soviets pledged improvements in
human rights in exchange for implicit Western acceptance of their
dominant position in Eastern Europe.
   Once the Vienna review is concluded, NATO and the Warsaw Pact
hope to open troop reduction talks. U.S. officials said it was still
possible to begin the negotiations before the Jan. 20 windup of the
Reagan administration.

<TEXT>
   A state Supreme Court decision allowing much
of the Proposition 103 insurance initiative to take effect but still
blocking a 20 percent cut in auto insurance rates pending legal
challenges was hailed by California's attorney general.
   The court's action Wednesday was ``the first step toward full
implementation of Proposition 103,'' said Attorney General John Van
de Kamp, who is defending the measure.
   The portions of the consumer-sponsored measure that the court
allowed to take effect will force companies to base insurance rates
primarily on a driver's record and experience and repeal an
exemption from state antitrust laws for insurance companies, among
other things.
   The court continued a stay on enforcing the rate rollback, the
most controversial plank of the initiative, and agreed to hear
insurers' claims that the measure would confiscate their property by
forcing them to operate at a loss.
   Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of Voter Revolt and author of the
measure, said he was disappointed the court did not allow the
rollback, but said he was excited some provisions would take effect.
   One insurance industry official expressed disappointment that the
court modified its stay on the entire initiative but said it was a
positive sign that the court had blocked the rollback.
   ``At first blush, we're pleased that the court will hear our
arguments, but we feel the briefing schedule is more relaxed than
we'd like,'' said John Kozero, a spokesman for Fireman's Fund
Insurance Cos. ``No date has been set for a hearing, and we hoped
for a speedy resolution to the case.''
   The court scheduled written arguments through Jan. 23, an
indication that the case is likely to be heard in February. A
decision would be required within the following three months.
   The court voted 6-1 to take the case. Dissenting Justice Stanley
Mosk indicated he thought the lawsuits should be dismissed as
premature, a position also taken by sponsors of the initiative,
including consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
   The announcement did not state reasons for the partial lifting of
the stay or give any other indication of the justices' views of the
lawsuits filed by insurance companies.
   The stay was imposed two days after the Nov. 8 election in which
Proposition 103 was the only one of five insurance-related
initiatives to pass.
   In Wednesday's announcement, the court left its stay in place for
only two of the measure's provisions.
   One would roll back vehicle and property insurance rates 20
percent below November 1987 levels and freeze them until November
1989, unless an insurer could show a ``substantial threat of
insolvency.'' The other would take the first steps toward
establishment of a nonprofit corporation to advocate the insterests
of insurance consumers.
   Provisions that will take effect include a ban on cancellation or
non-renewal of auto policies except for failure to pay, fraud, or an
increase in the risk.
   The court's order appeared to support the position of Van de Kamp
and private sponsors that a stay of all portions of the measure was
excessive because most do not threaten the companies with any
immediate, measurable financial harm.
   The insurers' lawsuits did not attack all provisions of
Proposition 103 but argued that the entire initiative should be
thrown out if the rate rollback and freeze are declared
unconstitutional.

   Secretary of State George Shultz rejected a
proposal from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to stop arming
Afghans and said anti-communist guerrillas were justified in trying
to seize territory before the Red Army completes its withdrawal.
   The fighting would continue, said Shultz, ``because the people of
Afghanistan, broadly speaking, do not accept the fact that the
puppet regime is entitled to hold certain areas of that country.''
   Gorbachev, in a wide-ranging speech Wednesday to the United
Nations General Assembly, called for a New Year's cease-fire in
Afghanistan, challenged Washington to stop arming the guerrillas,
and urged the warring parties to quit battling over terroritory.
   ``The bell of every regional conflict tolls for all of us,''
Gorbachev said, calling for superpower cooperation to end fighting
in Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia.
   The Red Army invaded Afghanistan in December 1979. Last spring
Gorbachev agreed to withdraw the estimated 110,000 Soviet troops
there by Feb. 15. He suspended the withdrawal last month on grounds
the guerrillas were firing on departing Soviet troops.
   The Soviets also introduced advanced jet fighters and Scud
ballistic missiles and began to use them against the guerrillas,
according to Reagan administration officials.
   Gorbachev offered to end the dispute and remove outside forces
from the Afghan conflict.
   ``I don't want to use this rostrum for recriminations against
anyone,'' he said.
   Shultz, however, brushed aside the two main points of Gorbachev's
Afghan proposal: that the superpowers stop arming the warring
parties and that the combatants not attempt to gain any more
territory.
   ``We proposed to the Soviet Union quite some time ago a mutual
cessation of supplies, and they rejected that,'' Shultz told a news
conference after Gorbachev, President Reagan and President-elect
George Bush left Governors Island following a lunch meeting.
   Besides, said Shultz, the anti-communist guerrillas known as
Mujahedeen ``don't need a great deal of war supplies because they
are capturing a lot'' from the Soviet-backed Afghan army.
   It was unrealistic to expect the rebels not to seize territory as
the Soviets pull out because of anger stemming from the war, he said.
   Prior to the Soviet occupation in December 1979, said Shultz,
Afghanistan had a population of 15.5 million, of whom 1 million have
since been killed or wounded, more than 3 million driven into
Pakistan, 2 million into Iran and 2 million displaced within the
country.
   ``So I don't think it's surprising that people who have been
exposed to that kind of turmoil don't want to have anything to do
with a puppet regime ...'' said Shultz.
   Nevertheless, said Shultz, ``I think it is a good thing that the
Soviets are talking directly to the Mujahedeen'' during
unprecedented negotiations that began last Sunday in Saudi Arabia.
   An agreement between the Kremlin and resistance forces might
prevent further attacks on Soviet forces as they leave, he said.
   U.S. officials have said they expect the Red Army to meet the
Feb. 15 deadline to withdraw completely from Afghanistan.
   Gorbachev's proposal called for:
   _ A comprehensive cease-fire as of Jan. 1.
   _ The cessation of all offensive operations or shellings.
   _ The rival Afghan groups retaining, during peace talks, all
territories under their control.
   _ On the same day, Jan. 1, suspension of all arms supplies.
   _ Establishment of a ``broad-based'' government in Kabul, the
Afghan capital. He did not specifically call for participation by
Communist elements, which the Moslem fundamentalist insurgents have
vowed to resist.
   _ Sending a contingent of United Nations peacekeepers to Kabul
and ``other strategic centers of the country.''
   _ Facilitation by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
of an international conference to neutralize and demilitarize
Afghanistan.

   NATO foreign ministers today called for
substantial reductions in conventional forces in Europe as part of
their negotiating position at upcoming arms talks.
   The NATO position, intended to cover Western and Soviet bloc
forces, was released one day after Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev said he would unilaterally cut the Soviet armed forces by
500,000 troops, including 50,000 in the East bloc.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz also met with NATO members
today to try to persuade them to insist on further cutbacks in
Soviet troops.
   In a statement today, the NATO ministers said they will propose
an overall limit on the total number of arms in Europe.
   ``This limit should be substantially lower than existing levels,
in the case of tanks close to half,'' it said. ``This would mean an
overall limit of about 40,000 tanks.''
   In the statement, the allies also said no country should be
allowed to have more than a fixed proportion, such as 30 percent, of
total arms in Europe. Such a formula, it said, would set a cap of no
more than about 12,000 tanks for any one country.
   It also said NATO negotiators would propose limits on forces
stationed in other countries' territory.
   The statement said the allies' position would apply to all of
Europe.
   ``In order to avoid undue concentration of these weapon
categories in certain areas of Europe, we shall propose appropriate
sub-limits,'' it said.
   The allies' position will be offered at the Conventional
Stability Talks, scheduled to get under way early next year in
Vienna, Austria.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany said the
allies hoped to end preliminary discussions next month for the
negotiations.
   Genscher told reporters ``a new chapter could be opened in the
history of disarmament'' because of Gorbachev's move, made in a U.N.
speech Wednesday. But the ministers were preparing today's proposals
before the Gorbachev speech.
   The ministers' statement said the troop reductions ``are a
positive contribution in correcting'' what the 16-nation alliance
contends is an enormous superiority of Soviet bloc forces in Europe.
   A recent NATO report said the Warsaw Pact maintained 3.1 million
ground forces, or personnel, compared with 2.2 million for the NATO
countries.
   ``They indicate the seriousness with which the conventional
imbalances which we have long highlighted as a key problem of
European security are now also addressed by the Soviet government,''
the ministers said.
   In addition to reduction in arms, the ministers said they will
ask the Warsaw Pact countries to go along with ``stabilizing
measures'' that will cover deployment, movement and levels of
readiness of conventional armed forces.
   They also said they will demand ``a rigorous and reliable regime
for monitoring and verification.''
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner opened the foreign
ministers' meeting by saying the unilateral troop cut in Eastern
Europe was an ``encouraging development'' but will not ``eliminate
Soviet superiority.''

   A resident of a home for battered women opened fire
on shelter residents, killing a worker and wounding two other people
before surrendering after being promised hair curlers, police said.
   Juanita Angela Whitaker, 40, was being held for investigation of
first-degree murder. She was scheduled to be arraigned today.
   Witnesses told police the woman entered the shelter, operated by
the Volunteers of America, Wednesday morning and began firing,
hitting three people.
   Jeanne Archuleta, 24, a housekeeper at the shelter, was shot in
the head and chest while she was vacuuming an office and died later
at a hospital. Ken Sanchez, 29, also an employee, was shot in the
stomach and Pamela Hand, 31, a client, was hit in the right leg.
Both were in satisfactory condition.
   Police said the woman continued walking down the first-floor
hallway, firing into closed doors.
   After the shooting started, Sanchez and Hand locked themselves in
a first-floor office and Whitaker ran downstairs and locked herself
in her basement apartment.
   Sgt. Phil Dinan, who negotiated the woman's surrender, said she
demanded hair curlers before turning herself in.
   ``She was saying, `I need to get dressed, I need to put on my
make-up. I need my curlers. I can't find them,''' Dinan said.``She
was threatening to kill officers, and she was threatening to kill
herself.''
   Dinan said the woman wanted to surrender, but was afraid.
   ``She kept saying, `I watch TV, I know you cops come in and kill
people,''' Dinan said.
   Whitaker finally gave up and surrendered after being told she
would be taken out an exit shielded from news cameras. Police said
Whitaker was a former nurse's aide from Norfolk, Va.
   Authorities said they were still trying to determine a motive,
although Carla Eilts, Whitaker's roommate, said the woman was
distraught over a phone call informing her that she would have to
leave the center.
   Before hanging up, Whitaker said, ``That's the end for me,''
authorities said.
   ``Then she had that mean look like she was getting frustrated.
She got mad ... and she took it out on everybody,'' Eilts said.

<TEXT>
   Operation Clean Sweep, the District of
Columbia's drug enforcement program, has not helped curb drug use in
the nation's capital but has created huge problems in the courts and
prisons, according to Police Chief Maurice T. Turner Jr.
   ``I don't see it having any impact on the demand for drugs,''
Turner said Wednesday. ``Arrests are not the answer.''
   ``We must reduce the demand side for the drug business,'' he said
in a Washington Post interview.
   The program, an expensive centerpiece of Mayor Marion Barry's
crackdown on drugs, has produced more than 43,000 arrests since
August 1986.
   Previous attempts to eliminate the program were strongly
criticized and blocked by the Barry administration.
   The city has recorded 336 homicides so far in 1988, most of them
drug-related. The previous high for a year was 287 in 1969.
   Turner said the police department has increased its ability to
arrest drug dealers. But at the same time, he said, the number of
drug users also has grown. ``All we have is more arrests,'' that
have ``crowded court calendars in D.C. Superior Court and pushed
prisons above their capacities,'' he said.
   Operation Clean Sweep usually is staffed by officers working
overtime. The overtime bill in the operation's first 18 months was
$6 million.

<TEXT>
   A shopping center being built at one
edge of a Jewish cemetery shouldn't disturb visitors to graves
nearby, said two Orthodox rabbis who toured the construction site.
   ``I have taken the facts which seem to indicate there was no
violation of burial areas,'' said Rabbi Gedalia Dov Schwartz of the
Chicago Rabbinical Council. ``That is the main consideration.''
   Rabbi Israel Fishweicher, executive director of the rabbinical
council, agreed.
   Developers want to build a shopping center on an unused portion
of Jewish Waldheim Cemetery, just west of Chicago.
   Plans for the center, to include consumer electronics and
clothing stores, were drafted more than a year ago and the village
rezoned the property in June.
   Criticism erupted when construction was witnessed by a few people
paying their respects at the cemetery. One objector even said he
might move the remains of his parents.
   Schwartz and Fishweicher toured the area Wednesday with shopping
center developers.
   Schwartz noted that a road separates the cemetery from the
shopping center, and Sportmart, the sporting goods retailer
developing the land, plans to erect a buffer of trees and bushes.
   A committee of the rabbinical council was scheduled to discuss
the issue at a meeting tonight, and the rabbinical council might
issue a report by the end of the week, Schwartz said.
   The Des Plaines Cemetery Corp., which owns the land, said the
land was originally reserved for burials but many Jewish families
have moved from the area, reducing the demand for burial plots.

   Opponents of proposals to close or merge more than
40 of the city's Roman Catholic parishes have delivered protest
petitions with an estimated 20,000 signatures to Cardinal Edmund C.
Szoka's residence.
   Before delivering the petitions Wednesday night, about 1,000
protesters held a prayer vigil at the Cathedral of the Blessed
Sacrament.
   ``St. Elizabeth's is like my second home,'' said Shedricka
Daniels, a mother of three and parishioner at a church that is on
the closing list. ``To close the doors would be like closing the
doors to my house. Wherever we have to go to get them to listen to
us, I'll follow.''
   Jay Berman, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said Szoka was not
at home to receive the petitions because of a previously scheduled
engagement to receive an award from a youth organization. The
signatures were accepted by the Rev. John Zenz, a secretary to Szoka.
   The cardinal is expected to make a decision on the church
closings in mid-January.

   A 2-year-old girl kidnapped with her
baby sitter was released unharmed 12 hours later, apparently by
captors who told a group of children ``she's missing, take her
home,'' police said.
   The child, who was taken from her home Tuesday night, appeared to
be in good physical condition, Police Officer Gary Luckett said.
   ``She was released in front of some third graders outside of
Woodcrest Elementary School'' around 8:30 a.m., he said. ``They told
the students, `She's missing, take her home,' and then they drove
away.''
   The child and her baby sitter, who was released earlier, were not
identified by police, but Luckett said members of the child's family
were not public figures.
   A man was arrested in the kidnapping after he allegedly attempted
to pick up ransom money, police said. They declined to release his
identity. Two other men also were being sought in the case.
   The child and the 26-year-old baby sitter were abducted by two
armed men who forced their way into the youngster's home,
blindfolded the baby sitter, then drove off with them, Luckett said.
   The woman was released around midnight and told to ```start
walking and don't turn around,''' Luckett said.
   The kidnappers then called the child's grandfather and demanded a
$300,000 ransom be placed in a safe at a location in South-Central
Los Angeles, Luckett said.
   Police accompanied the grandfather as he left the ransom money at
the spot and later arrested a man who tried to pick up the cash.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's image flickered on the
black-and-white television screen, a translator's voice muffling the
Soviet president's strenuous defense of new Soviet laws on Jewish
emigration.
   ``He's just repeating the same things we've heard already,''
muttered Manashir Ifraimov, one of thousands of Soviet immigrants
settled in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn.
   Like other emigres in this vibrant community dubbed ``Little
Odessa,'' he paid casual but constant attention to the events across
the East River on Wednesday, as Gorbachev spoke to the United
Nations and toured Manhattan during a visit shortened by an
earthquake in the southern Soviet Union.
   ``We've heard these words. Now he has to make them real,''
Ifraimov said.
   Ifraimov, an economist-turned-butcher who emigrated two months
ago from Soviet Azerbaijan, turned from the TV to finish slicing a
customer's ham.
   ``People are accustomed to a lot of talking, but people don't
always believe it,'' Ifraimov said. ``They are used to living with
promises. They just want their kids to have a better life.''
   New York's Soviet immigrants differed in their degree of optimism
about the visiting leader's reforms. But many lauded glasnost _
Gorbachev's policy of openness _ for enabling them and their
families to leave or travel from the Soviet Union more freely than
ever imagined.
   ``I would not leave if I was there now,'' said Rimma Melik, owner
of the popular Kavkas Restaurant, who emigrated here in 1978 and has
visited her family in the Soviet Union twice in recent years.
   Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika, his program of economic and
social restructuring, have played well even among stalwart critics
who insist the reforms are little more than a publicity stunt.
   ``People are not getting better. Housing and roads are falling
apart,'' said Sophia Perett, executive director of the Center For
Russian Immigrants. ``People's main concern is to have food on the
table and to get by every month. For them nothing has changed.''
   Still, there has been a very real increase in tourist and exit
visas, she said. The last large wave of emigration ended in 1979
with detente.
   Last year some 1,500 immigrants received tourist visas through
the People's Travel Club, said Leon Kogan, manager of the agency's
Brighton Beach branch. Other travel agents reported similar
increases, a sign of the times under Gorbachev's glasnost.
   ``We expect the number to be higher this year,'' he said.
   Groups of rabbis, artists, writers, students and performers are
streaming in and out of the Soviet Union, singing the praises of
``Gorbachevism,'' as one new emigre book labels it.
   Mrs. Melik agreed that living conditions in the Soviet Union have
not changed. But she said Gorbachev has reignited hope for the
future, a feeling she said means the difference between staying or
leaving.
   She said Soviet scientists and professionals, the kind Gorbachev
needs to reshape his country, will decide to stay when conditions
improve.
   ``Most important is that people love their Motherland. People who
had to wait 10 to 20 years are now more free to show their work. And
they will make this country, if they will be allowed. It will be a
great county,'' she said.
   Emigrants give Gorbachev credit more for what could happen than
what has happened, realizing much also depends on relations with the
United States.
   ``I support any contact, even negative contact,'' said Ifraimov,
whose brother arrived in New York last week after waiting just two
months for an exit visa.
   When asked what he would say if Gorbachev was standing right in
front of his butcher counter, Ifraimov didn't hesitate a moment.
   ``I'd say, `You're on the right course.' ''

   Jessica Hahn, whose sexual encounter with TV

   Ms. Hahn, 29, began work in September under a 30-day contract,
initially with the morning crew at the top 40 station. That contract
was renewed and extended to year's end, and she was moved to the
station's evening show.
   This week, KOY General Manager Mike Horne said Ms. Hahn's

Dec. 31. He did not say why her contract wasn't renewed.

   The governor has rejected a request to
reduce the prison sentence of a killer who left death row to become
a model inmate and a nationally recognized prison journalist.
   Wilbert Rideau, who is serving a life sentence, was originally
sentenced to death for a 1961 bank robbery in which he kidnapped
three employees, shot and wounded two of them and killed the third
by slitting her throat.
   Although Rideau, 47, has been praised by prison officials for his
behavior behind bars, his previous bids for a reduced sentence have
been rejected because of strong opposition from Calcasieu Parish law
enforcement officials and the victims.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer cited the same reasons in issuing his decision
Wednesday.
   ``Given the horrible nature of this crime, the fact that both
surviving victims oppose clemency and the fact that Calcasieu law
enforcement officials oppose clemency, I deny Rideau's plea for a
reduced sentence,'' Roemer said.
   A reduced sentence would have made Rideau eligible for parole.
   Rideau was arrested shortly after the robbery and murder and
confessed in front of television cameras. He spent 10 years on death
row until the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state's capital
punishment law in 1972.
   With his sentence commuted to life in prison, he became the first
black to gain a position on the prison magazine, the Angolite, and
is now editor.
   Rideau has said his journalism is proof of his rehabilitation.
   He is one of the most visible inmates at the Lousisiana State
Pentitentiary at Angola, frequently appearing on national television
shows. He and other editors have been singled out for national
recognition by organizations ranging from private foundations to the
American Bar Association.

   A jury ordered the death penalty for a man
convicted of stabbing two women to death and wounding a married
couple at an archaeological site.
   In announcing the death penalty Wednesday, jury foreman David J.
Roscoe said the panel believed Arthur Faulkner had ``a degree of
mental illness,'' but that was outweighed by the savagery of the
crimes for which the jury had convicted Faulkner on Tuesday.
   Faulkner, 32, was found guilty of murder, attempted murder,
aggravated assault, rape and other offenses in the April 1 stabbing
deaths of the women and the wounding of a husband and wife.
   When the death sentence was announced, Faulkner shrugged.
   Delores Dorner, mother of one of the victims, said: ``I prayed
very hard for this day. It will never bring her back, but at least
she'll rest in peace now, and I'll have peace of mind.''
   Faulkner's court-appointed attorney, Robert A. Selig, portrayed
his client during the sentencing hearing as suffering from paranoia
and schizophrenia, disorders he said could have prompted Faulkner to
commit the murders.
   Gerald Cooke, a forensic psychologist, testified that Faulkner
hears voices and had been psychotic for many years.
   But Dr. Timothy Michaels, a prosecution witness, said Faulkner
does not meet the criteria for a paranoid schizophrenic and that he
did not suffer from organic brain damage, another defense assertion.
   Selig's plans to present an insanity defense for Faulkner during
the trial fell through when Montgomery County Common Pleas Judge
Samuel Salus ruled the two psychiatric experts who had evaluated
Faulkner could not testify because they had not found him legally
insane. Selig called no witnesses during the trial.
   Faulkner was convicted in the stabbing deaths of Clarice Dorner,
30, of Elk Grove Village, Ill., and Annalise Killoran, 22, of Lynn,
Mass. Faulkner also was charged with attacking Glenn Sheehan, 39,
who operated S.J.S. Industries, the archaeological firm where
Faulkner and the victims worked, and Sheehan's 31-year-old pregnant
wife, Anne Jensen.
   After the sentencing hearing, District Attorney Michael Marino
called Faulkner ``a brutal, sadistic murderer who hates women. The
man's an absolute menace and the death penalty is entirely
appropriate for him.''
   Selig said he would appeal. He said he ``would feel better if
this had been a fair trial.''

<HEAD>Black African Leader Transferred To House On Prison Farm</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with calls for Mandela's release,
other details. Changes byline. No pickup.
^By LAURINDA KEYS</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela today demanded his unconditional
release, saying his transfer to a house on a prison farm simply gave
him a more luxurious cell.
   The government has been under intense domestic and international
pressure to release the 70-year-old Mandela, who has been in prison
since 1962.
   ``The government is playing games. Mr. Mandela is still a
prisoner, confined to the premises of a jail,'' said Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   ``Let the government release him and all other political
prisoners unconditionally. Then they will see the enormous influence
for good, for peace and reconciliation that he will be,'' he said.
   Mandela was transferred Wednesday night from the private
Constantiaberg Clinic near Cape Town where he had recovered from
tuberculosis, the government said. He was taken to a suburban-style
house with a swimming pool and garden at the Victor Verster prison
farm in Paarl, a scenic wine-growing town northeast of Cape Town.
The government says he can have unlimited access to his wife,
children and grandchildren.
   ``Mr. Mandela is not confined to the house and has free use of a
wide range of facilities,'' the Prisons Service said today.
   But officials indicated Wednesday that Mandela's release is not
imminent and restraints on him will be eased in stages so the
government can assess the political impact of his possible freedom.
   ``That is not freeing him unconditionally,'' said Helen Joseph,
83, the first South African ever placed under house arrest for
anti-apartheid activities. ``It's scandalous to play cat and mouse
like this. He's not free, he's just in a luxurious prison, a more
comfortable jail.''
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, in a statement released by attorney
Ismail Ayob, rejected the offer of unlimited visits and said she
would continue the monthly 40-minute visits ``until all political
prisoners are given the same privileges.'' There was no indication
that other visitors, such as the media, would be allowed access to
Mandela.
   Mandela was convicted in 1964 of sabotage and plotting to
overthrow the white minority government.
   The outlawed African National Congress is the largest guerrilla
organization fighting the government and apartheid.
   Mandela has rejected the government's repeated offers to release
him if he renounces violence or lives in a tribal homeland. He has
said the government should renounce violence, end apartheid and
legalize the ANC.
   In August, Mandela was diagnosed with tuberculosis and
transferred to a hospital from Cape Town's Pollsmoor Prison. Later,
he was moved to the Constantiaberg Clinic, a private hospital near
Pollsmoor, and officials announced last month Mandela would not
return to Pollsmoor upon recuperation.
   Mandela's transfer is one of a series of moves by the government
in the past two weeks aimed at easing international pressure on
South Africa.
   The government has commuted the controversial death sentences of
six blacks known as the Sharpeville Six and freed two other
prominent, long-serving black prisoners _ ANC leader Harry Gwala and
Zeph Mothopeng, president of the rival Pan-Africanist Congress.
   But the government has given no indication that it is willing to
negotiate with freed black leaders on their demands for one-person,
one-vote democracy.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressman who raised money from unions for
other GOP House candidates, the government's top personnel officer
and a Washington labor lawyer are the top candidates for secretary
of labor in the Bush administration, officials said.
   Both Rep. Thomas Ridge of Pennsylvania and Office of Personnel
Management Director Constance Horner have been conducting low-key
campaigns to get the job.
   William J. Kilberg, whose wife Barbara is a member of
President-elect George Bush's transition staff, has told associates
he is ``absolutely not interested'' because it would mean giving up
a lucrative law practice, but his name is still in the pot, a
transition official said Wednesday.
   ``All three of them have been mentioned frequently; all three are
still alive,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Ridge's and Horner's names were mentioned to the AFL-CIO earlier
this week by Bush's transition team, according to one business
lobbyist, who said Horner apparently was labeled as unacceptable to
the labor leaders.
   The labor federation endorsed Democrat Michael Dukakis in the
presidential election. Rex Hardesty, an AFL-CIO spokesman, said it
would have no comment on any discussions concerning the Republican
president-elect's personnel actions until after they are announced.
   Also mentioned as a long-shot candidate is Frank P. Doyle, senior
vice president for General Electric Co. in charge of the company's
labor, government and media relations.
   Doyle acknowledged in an interview that he has been approached
about the job and is interested but said his political party
affiliation is a major hurdle.
   He's a Democrat _ not just a registered Democrat but a person who
has raised political money for Democratic candidates, a sure
disqualifier, according to one senior Republican official.
   Although they have been adversaries across the bargaining table
for three decades, labor leaders familiar with Doyle view him as one
of their more ``enlightened'' opponents and would have no problem
with his nomination.
   However, several business leaders do. Many of them view Doyle as
too ``progressive,'' citing GE's willingness to accept congressional
legislation mandating 60-day advance notices of plant closings and
layoffs and its support for a bill that would have made employers
warn workers about potential health hazards on the job.
   Ridge, 43, represents a heavily blue-collar district around Erie,
Pa., and helped raise money from several unions, including the
building trades and the United Food and Commercial Workers, for
other GOP House candidates as an active chairman of the
congressional Republican Labor Council.
   ``He's young and a total break from the past,'' said one union
official. ``If George Bush wants a bridge to labor, Ridge could
build it. He's also someone who knows Capitol Hill at a time when
there are going to be a lot of labor initiatives legislatively.''
   Horner, who had worked in Bush's 1980 campaign for president,
sought the labor post a year ago when President Reagan gave it to
Ann McLaughlin. Her point position for the administration on drug
testing of federal workers and opposing comparable worth efforts to
raise women's pay engendered heavy opposition then from public
employee unions.
   However, the leadership of the largest federal workers' union,
the American Federation of Government Employees representing some
700,000 employees, has changed hands since then.
   Its new president, John Sturdivant, a black whose white opponent
was endorsed by Jesse Jackson, says he has a good working
relationship with Horner and would not oppose her. Other union
sources, however, say opposition to her remains intense among other
high-ranking labor leaders.
   Kilberg, 42, was the Labor Department's solicitor from 1973 to
1977 and also was chief counsel for the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service during the Nixon administration.
   He is now a partner in a Washington law firm, representing
employers in dealings with government agencies and unions and
Congress, and also is editor-in-chief of the Employee Relations Law
Journal.
   Kilberg attended Cornell University on a local scholarship from
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and is
considered by both labor and business leaders to have been a
knowledgeable ``honest broker'' in the government posts he held.
   Kilberg is said to be reluctant to give up his practice. He also
is involved in complicated pension cases that he is reluctant to
leave, said one person close to him.
   However, Kilberg and his wife are family friends of the Bushes.
And both the president-elect and his wife, Barbara, showed up at a
fund-raising picnic for Mrs. Kilberg when she ran for a seat in the
Virginia Legislature.

<HEAD>Commission Debating Pay Raise Recommendation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal commission will vote next week on
whether to recommend a pay raise for the federal government's top
officials, including members of Congress and judges, but only if the
officials are banned from accepting pay for speeches and other
outside work.
   The commission's recommendations will be sent to President Reagan
on Dec. 15; he can either raise or lower the figures. Reagan's
decision will take effect next month unless Congress blocks the
action.
   The panel, known as the Commission on Executive, Legislative and
Judicial Salaries, meets after every presidential election to
recommend salary level of top officials.
   A draft report being considered by the panel recommends a pay
increase, although it does not contain any figures. But it says the
raise should be granted only in conjunction with a ban on outside
income, known as honoaria.
   Members of Congress, who are now paid $89,500, can receive
honoraria for speeches and articles. The panel endorsed an honoraria
ban for the top 2,498 federal officials, including Cabinet members
and judges.
   Cabinet members are now paid $99,500, while most judges receive
$89,500. During two days of hearings last month, the commission
heard testimony that a number of federal judges have resigned and
returned to practicing law because lawyers receive much greater pay.
   Two years ago, another commission recommended that congressional
pay be raised to $135,000 a year, Cabinet members be paid $160,000,
and most judges be paid $130,000. But Reagan reduced the
recommendations to the current pay levels.
   The draft report also endorsed a pay raise for the president, who
has received $200,000 annually since 1969. But it sets no figure.
   Lloyd Cutler, chairman of the panel, and other members have
publicly endorsed the need for higher pay, saying that inflation has
far outstripped pay rates, making it hard for the government to
attract top talent.
   On the average, federal salaries will now only buy 65 percent of
what they would in 1969, the draft report notes, but salaries earned
by average non-federal workers will buy about 1.5 percent more than
1969.
   ``In other words,'' the report noted, ``high-level government
officials have seen the purchasing power of their salaries eroded by
more than one-third while other wage earners have on average at
least maintained their purchasing power.''
   ``No statistic could more clearly demonstrate how high-level
public service today imposes a financial penalty on those in public
service and their families, notwithstanding the privilege and
satisfaction of answering the nation's call,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, using measures he had
hoped to apply to the federal budget, unveiled a package of spending
cuts, layoffs, and increased tax enforcement to close a
Massachusetts budget deficit of at least $636 million.
   But less than a month after losing the presidential election to
Vice President George Bush and his ``read my lips'' pledge not to
raise taxes, Dukakis gave his strongest hint yet that he might
consider new levies if the package doesn't balance his $11.6 billion
budget.
   The Democratic governor said he would wait until the end of this
month to monitor spending and tax collections before deciding.
   ``I'm not going to recommend increased taxes unless I think we
must have them. I want to make sure we do everything we can to meet
these goals before we go down that road,'' he said.
   Dukakis spoke to reporters at a Statehouse news conference jammed
with anxious legislators and government staffers to give his first
detailed assessment of the state's fiscal predicament since the Nov.
8 election.
   After months of warnings from legislators about the state's
budget, Dukakis estimated the budget deficit would be at least $636
million in the fiscal year that ends June 30. He reached the
forecast after trimming his revenue projections by $308 million, as
recommended by the Revenue Advisory Board.
   ``We have serious problems facing us,'' Dukakis said, but he
added that the state must make investments in the future. ``If they
are not going to be made in Washington, they have to be made, to
some extent, right here in Massachusetts.''
   Among his proposals were eliminating 300 unspecified management
positions, reducing the state's consultant budget by $15 million and
adding millions of dollars in new fees.
   In a message apparently intended for his liberal supporters,
Dukakis insisted he would not retreat from the agenda he has
followed since returning to office in 1983.
   ``I want to make it very clear that we're going to fight for the
goals and values that have guided us for the past six years,'' he
said, citing education, employment, environmental protection,
housing and health care.
   To close the budget gap, he said the state would draw $121
million from its ``rainy day'' fund, raise $90 million through
stepped-up tax collection efforts, delay $84 million in college
scholarship funds and save $100 million by cutting Medicaid waste
and squeezing executive agencies.
   The plan also includes at least $165 million in forced spending
cuts by the state bureaucracy.
   Dukakis defended his plan to tap the ``rainy day'' fund, which
bond-rating agencies consistently cite as a reason for the state's
high credit rating. The governor said the stabilization fund was
created for situations similar to what the state is facing.
   Asked whether his presidential campaign had contributed to the
problem or delayed his response to it, Dukakis noted that he cut or
withheld $200 million before signing the budget in July and said tax
collections were on target in the first four months of the fiscal
year.

   Three family members who barricaded
themselves inside their foreclosed house surrendered today after a
15-hour standoff that began when someone fired shots at police
trying to serve an eviction notice.
   Before dawn, officers finally coaxed Raymond Baumiller, his
mother, Katherine, and his 24-year-old sister from the house, police
said.
   Baumiller, 38, was arraigned before a Canonsburg magistrate on
charges of attempted homicide, aggravated assault and recklessly
endangering another person. He was held in lieu of $10,000 bond. The
women were not charged.
   No one was hurt in the standoff, which ended about 5:30 a.m.
   ``The American dream has turned into the American nightmare,''
Mrs. Baumiller said after the family surrendered. She accused her
mortgage lender of conspiring with others, whom she did not name, to
foreclose on the house after her husband died in 1980.
   ``There's no indication in our files that there was any dispute
of that nature,'' said Richard L. White, president of Washington
Federal Savings & Loan Association.
   He said the bank foreclosed after the family failed to respond to
letters and notices informing them they had fallen behind in their
monthly payments on a $20,500 mortgage taken out in 1973.
   Mrs. Baumiller described herself as a retired housewife and said
her son quit his job as a letter handler for the Postal Service
several years ago.
   ``They're very quiet people and just kept to themselves,'' said
Kelly Roth, 33, who lives across the street. ``They're very private
people.''
   Sgt. Sam Secreet of the Washington County sheriff's office said
he and two other deputies knocked at the front door of Baumiller's
house about 2 p.m. Wednesday but received no response. Authorities
tried unsuccessfully to reach the occupants by phone and through
loudspeakers.
   The deputies and Carroll Township police Chief Howard Springer
knocked at the door again and four shots were fired at them from
inside the house, Secreet said. No one was injured.
   ``Thank God. It was close, but no one was hurt,'' he said. ``We
ran for cover as fast as we could.''
   Secreet said authorities repeatedly tried calling the house, but
someone hung up on them each time.
   Sheriff's deputies, police officers and firefighters were posted
outside the 2{-story, white aluminum-sided house in Carroll
Township, about 15 miles south of Pittsburgh. A special emergency
response team from the state police headquarters in Harrisburg
arrived late Wednesday.
   Power to the house was cut off, but the building just outside
Monongahela was illuminated overnight by portable lights erected
outside by authorities.
   Washington Federal Savings & Loan, which foreclosed on the
property in July, granted a 30-day extension Wednesday night in an
attempt to end the standoff, authorities said.

<HEAD>Soviet-American Emerging Leaders Summit Ends With Agreements</HEAD>

   Soviet and U.S. citizens ended a weeklong
meeting with some tearful goodbyes, but vowed to continue improving
relations between the superpowers.
   ``We are confident that what we have started here in Philadelphia
will continue in the future, and be beneficial not only to the
people of our two great nations but to all people of the world,''
the 170 Soviets and 169 Americans said Wednesday in a joint
statement capping the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Emerging Leaders Summit.
   ``It was a good beginning,'' said Stephen Hayes of Columbus,
Ind., president of the American Center for International Leadership,
which co-sponsored the gathering with the Soviet Union's Committee
of Youth Organizations.
   The Soviet delegates enjoyed last-minute shopping before leaving
the city for Washington and four days of sightseeing before heading
home. The group also spent two days in Chicago before arriving here.
   A reciprocal summit is tentatively planned in the Soviet Union
next year.
   ``We as emerging leaders are about to become the custodians of
this planet. When we take charge, I hope we do so in the spirit of
cooperation without fear of each other and a commitment to see to it
that the next generation, and the generations after that, will live
a long and peaceful life,'' said leadership board chairman Raoul
Carroll.
   Hayes and Sergei Chelnokov, chairman of the Soviet committee,
said many of the agreements reached at the summit covering 16 areas
ranging from religion to Soviet-American relations will be made
public within the next two months
   One agreement announced by the science and technology commission
recommended: ``Scientific communities of our nations should join
efforts to overcome unjustified restrictions imposed on the exchange
of information and ideas.''
   The commission suggested establishing joint workshops on an
unpiloted mission to Mars before the year 2000, alternative sources
of energy, the global warming crisis and computer-based information
gateways.
   Meanwhile, Drexel University President Richard D. Breslin made
sure there was ``at least one tangible result'' from the summit.
   He announced the creation of a full-tuition scholarship that will
enable a Soviet student to pursue three years of graduate study at
Drexel. Of Drexel's 12,265 current students, only four are from the
Soviet Union, according to university officials.
   The details of the scholarship _ which could be worth up to
$28,800 _ still need to be worked out with the Soviet Ministry of
Education, he said.
   The student is expected to start at Drexel in September 1989.
   ``It's going to be marvelous,'' Breslin said. ``We hope that the
scholarship is a beginning of an exchange ... of faculty members and
learning between ourselves and some of their fine learning
institutions.''

<HEAD>New York Mayor Koch Challenges Bush to Do More for America's Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONNI EFRON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The incoming Bush administration needs to give
cities more help in dealing with AIDS, drug abuse, homelessness and
job training, New York Mayor Edward I. Koch has told the nation's
urban leaders.
   In a speech to 2,000 delegates at the close of the annual
National League of Cities conference, Koch said the federal
government must no longer ``slough off its responsibilities'' onto
states and cities.
   Also Wednesday, President-elect George Bush sent a letter to the
conference promising to act on its concerns. ``I want to assure you
that your needs are my needs,'' Bush said.
   Koch said the letter was an encouraging sign, and he promised his
cooperation.
   ``Our job is to make him a really great president _ until his
fourth year,'' said Koch, a Democrat.
   The mayor said he had asked for a meeting with Bush after the
inauguration and had invited the president-elect and his wife,
Barbara, to visit Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence, to
discuss urban problems.
   ``We need help and we need it desperately,'' said Koch.
   He argued that cities by themselves cannot fight the national
drug problem, cure acquired immune deficiency syndrome or house the
homeless. And he said urban issues were discussed only superficially
during the presidential campaign, so urban leaders can only guess at
Bush's intentions.
   ``I really can't read his lips. I am not a lipreader,'' he said,
drawing laughter and cheers from the audience of mayors and other
city officials in reference to Bush's ``read my lips'' pledge not to
raise taxes.
   New York City now has 55,000 prisoners, compared to 40,000 in all
federal prisons, and spends close to half its $1 billion annual
police budget on drug enforcement, Koch said. He said 80 percent of
those arrested for violent crimes in New York City are found to have
drugs in their systems.
   ``We cannot deal with it,'' Koch said. ``I have doubled the
number of jails and it's not enough.''
   And while New York has earmarked $5.1 billion to build housing,
the federal government provides ``only a pittance'' to support
elderly housing, he said.
   ``George, read my lips: Homeless!'' Koch quipped.

<HEAD>Bush Inauguration Will Have Lots of Tradition _ and Metal Detectors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's inauguration Jan. 20 will cost
more than $20 million and feature a half-dozen free events in
addition to balls and dinners at up to $1,500 a ticket, the
Presidential Inaugural Committee said today.
   ``This inauguration is different because we're going to try to
have more free events than at any inauguration before,'' said
committee co-chairman Bobby Holt.
   The free events range from a children's festival commemorating
200 years of inaugurations to a White House welcome for the public
on Bush's first morning in residence there. The most expensive event
is the Inaugural Dinner Jan. 18 at Union Station, at $1,500 per
person. A ticket to one of eight official balls goes for $175, but
$30 will get you into a Young American Ball.
   Holt said the budget for official inaugural events sponsored by
the presidential committee will be $20 million to $25 million. The
money is being raised as interest-free loans that will be repaid
with proceeds from ticket sales and other inaugural marketing.
   Holt said loans of $100,000 or more are being accepted, but
smaller in-kind contributions are also welcome. Walter Ganzi Jr.,
the committee's finance chairman, said about half the money needed
has been raised.
   Both the presidential committee and a bipartisan congressional
committee in charge of the oath-taking ceremony are leaning heavily
on the bicentennial theme.
   Some of the trappings of Bush's inauguration ceremony would look
familiar to George Washington: 13-star flags, for example, and red
bunting and the First Great Seal, which was the newborn nation's
emblem from 1782 to 1841.
   But metal detectors and 140,000-plus spectators surely would have
startled the first president.
   Bush's bicentennial inauguration ceremony combines the old and
the new, with the most dramatic change the introduction of security
precautions for the first time.
   The West Front of the Capitol, the site of the Jan. 20
oath-taking, will be accessible only through four gates equipped
with metal detectors. All guests will be screened before the
ceremony _ a prospect that strikes terror in the heart of a key
organizer.
   ``My worst nightmare is that 50,000 people will show up at 11:20
a.m. for a ceremony that starts at 11:30,'' said Michael Ruehling,
executive director of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural
Ceremonies.
   Hoping to attract early arrivals, the congressional committee
will open the gates at 9 a.m. and has scheduled a musical interlude
by the U.S. Marine Band at 10:30 a.m. ``The only thing we're not
providing is popcorn,'' Ruehling said. ``I don't know what else we
can do, but it does scare me.''
   The Constitution stipulates that the oath of office must be taken
at noon, so latecomers will be out of luck.
   Bush will be sworn in against a backdrop of five flags _ two from
1789, with stars representing the 13 original states; two from 1889,
with 38 stars, and one flag with the current 50 stars.
   He'll step onto the platform through an archway festooned with
red bunting similar to the bunting draped over the door of Federal
Hall in New York when Washington was sworn in for his first term in
1789. The plan is for Bush to take the oath on the same 1767 Bible
that Washington used. And all inaugural materials will bear the
First Great Seal.
   As has become custom, Bush's inauguration ceremony will be more
elaborate than the first one 200 years ago. At Federal Hall,
Washington simply bowed to his audience, repeated the 35-word oath
of office and added, ``I swear, so help me God.''
   This year, music will be provided by the U.S. Marine and Army
bands and the Harlan (Ky.) Boys Choir. The Rev. Billy Graham will
deliver the invocation and the benediction. Chief Justice William
Rehnquist will administer the oath of office to Bush, while Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor will swear in the vice president, the
congressional committee said.
   Inaugural planners are working ``to make it a little extra
special'' in light of the bicentennial, Ruehling said.
   The expanded program is designed as a souvenir, with four pages
of inaugural history in addition to the schedule of events. In
addition, for the first time, the program will name the president
and vice president instead of referring to them by their offices, as
has always been the case previously.
   The Bush inauguration marks only the second time the ceremony has
been held on the Capitol's West Front. From his podium, Bush will
have a panoramic view of the grassy Mall, the soaring Washington
Monument and many grand buildings of the city.
   President Reagan was sworn in there in 1981. But most
inaugurations have taken place on the East Front, which overlooks
the asphalt Capitol parking area as well as the landscaped Capitol
grounds.
   The inauguration platform and stands under construction on the
West Front are costing $323,000 to build. Taxpayers are paying for
the inaugural preparations and also for an hour-long lunch for 200
in the Capitol's Statuary Hall.

   Seven administrators at a nuclear weapons
facility shut down for safety concerns received performance bonuses
of as much as $10,845 a year, according to Department of Energy
documents.
   The documents, obtained by The Augusta Chronicle and the Augusta
Herald under the Freedom of Information Act, showed that the former
manager of the Savannah River plant, Robert L. Morgan, received a
total of $28,125 in bonuses for 1982, 1985 and 1986. Morgan, who is
retired, received $10,845 in both 1985 and 1986.
   ``I believe the highest bonus that can be given is $20,000,'' DOE
spokesman Will Allicotte said Wednesday by telephone from Washington.
   All three reactors at the sprawling nuclear weapons facility in
suburban Aiken County, S.C., were reduced to 50 percent power in
March 1987. The reactors have been shut down since August for safety
upgrades.
   The documents also showed that former Deputy Manager Bruce G.
Twining, now manager of DOE's Albuquerque operations office,
received a total of $21,760 in bonuses for 1985, 1986 and 1987.
   Richard P. Denise, another former deputy manager, received a
total of $20,550 for 1981 and 1982. Former assistant manager for
operations, Edward S. Goldberg, received a total of $16,300 for 1983
and 1984.
   Melvin J. Sires III, another former assistant manager for
operations, received a total of $19,800 for 1985, 1986 and 1988.
Ernest S. Chaput, assistant manager for administration, received a
total of $7,105 for 1985 and 1988.
   Chief Counsel Warren E. Bergholz Jr. received $3,671 in 1988.
   All those receiving bonuses were Department of Energy employees.

   West European leaders welcomed Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's pledge to unilaterally cut Soviet conventional forces,
but some warned that even after such a move the Soviets will remain
militarily superior to NATO.
   China's leaders also welcomed the Soviet president's pledge, in a
speech at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday, to demobilize
500,000 troops.
   Gorbachev said that as part of the initiative to reduce the
Soviet army to about 5 million soldiers ``a major portion of Soviet
troops temporarily stationed (in Mongolia) will return home.''
   ``This is a positive development,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Li
Zhaoxing said in Beijing.
   China long has demanded the Kremlin reduce its troop presence
along their common border as a condition for normalizing relations
after nearly 30 years of estrangement. The Soviet Union stations
nearly 50,000 troops in Mongolia and pulled out about 12,000
soldiers in 1987.
   Most East European news media reported without comment on
Gorbachev's promise, including a pledge to remove 5,000 tanks and
50,000 troops from East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   But the Czechoslovak Communist daily Rude Pravo said the aim ``is
to give conventional disarmament a vital shot in the arm.''
   ``The point is literally to force Western partners to stop giving
speeches ... about the need for disarmament, about their concern
about the buildup of troops and military technology in Europe, and
to start acting,'' said foreign editor Milan Jelinek.
   State TV in communist Poland carried without comment footage of
Gorbachev making the announcement.
   In Warsaw, Jacek Czaputowicz, co-founder of Poland's pacifist
group Peace and Freedom, said it could be the ``first step'' to
withdrawing Soviet troops from Poland.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain called it ``a very
positive step forward,'' and ``just exactly what we wanted.''
   Asked if she thought the West should respond with its own
proposals, Mrs. Thatcher said: ``According to the briefing I had ...
it reduces their superiority in conventional weapons from about
3-to-1 to 2-to-1. So it is a very, very fundamental change that he
is making.''
   In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said the move
``seems to be a step in the right direction,'' but warned big
imbalances would remain.
   West German Defense Minister Rupert Scholz said Gorbachev must
follow up with ``actual and verifiable withdrawal of troops and
reduction of forces.''
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement of France told reporters
that Gorbachev's ``art is to make announcements before he is forced
to.''
   ``It is a firm Western position that leads the Soviets to make
gestures that are indispensible for a return to detente in Europe,''
said Chevenement.
   Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti called the proposals
``very significant'' and said Gorbachev was sending a ``clear
signal'' to the new U.S. administration that he seeks continuity in
arms reductions.
   But Mikhail Agursky of Hebrew University in Jerusalem said,
``These changes are not aimed at the United States, but at Europe.
Strategically, Europe is now more important to the Russians.''
   Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez welcomed
Gorbachev's proposals, but said, ``The Soviets know that in
conventional arms negotiations they have to reduce much more than
Western allies.''
   Finland's President Mauno Koivisto said Wednesday was ``a day of
joy.''
   In neutral Sweden, Foreign Minister Sten Andersson said, ``It
resembles all Gorbachev's surprise initiatives _ it is bold, it is
interesting and it is promising. And it should be taken seriously.''
   Outside Europe, Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said it
was a ``good thing.''
   Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo said Gorbachev's speech
reflected ``a sort of new philosophical approach in Soviet foreign
policy and I think this is very, very important.''
   In Washington, key legislators said they were pleased by the
promised cut but want action, not words.

   The live-in companion of an accused child killer
testified today that she and the defendant knew before their
``adopted'' daughter, Lisa, was born that the baby would probably be
given to them.
   Joel Steinberg, 47, is charged with fatally beating the illegally
adopted child. She was removed unconscious from his apartment on
Nov. 2, 1987, and died of a brain injury three days later.
   Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's battered former companion and the
prosecution's chief witness, testified at the trial today that the
baby's biological mother was a friend of hers and Steinberg's.
   ``We were kept aware of her health and progress,'' Ms. Nussbaum
said.
   Michele Launders, 27, the mother, has watched the trial daily
from a front-row seat. Steinberg, a lawyer who has since been
disbarred, had told Ms. Launders that her child would be placed with
a middle-class Catholic family in Manhattan and she paid Steinberg
$500 for ``filing fees.''
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, testified she and Steinberg began talking about
adopting a child in 1980.
   ``I had been trying to conceive and was unable to,'' she said.
Steinberg, as a lawyer, ``had done a number of adoptions and we
talked about doing one for ourselves.''
   Lisa was born May 14, 1981. Ms. Launders has said that she was in
the baby's presence only for seconds before the infant was taken
away.
   Testimony resumed after a one-day break Wednesday,
   Nussbaum testified Tuesday that she and Steinberg were told by a
physician friend in October 1983 that his wife had abused Lisa, then
2. Ms. Nussbaum said Lisa's genital area was bruised when the girl
returned from a stay with the physician and his wife.
   The sex abuse allegation was first discovered in papers found by
police when they searched Steinberg's apartment after Lisa's death.
In the papers, Dr. Michael Green accuses his wife, Shayna, of
sexually molesting the girl in the summer of 1983 when the child
visited the Greens' Long Island home.
   But Assistant District Attorney Peter Casolaro said out of the
jury's hearing that the statement was ``created by Mr. Green at
Steinberg's urging ... for the purpose of slandering his (Green's)
wife in a divorce.''
   A source said the prosecution investigated and found no basis to
conclude Mrs. Green had molested Lisa. The source said the Greens
told investigators that if Hedda saw anything on the girl, it was
``diaper rash.''
   Green told police Steinberg ``coerced'' him into accusing his
wife of abusing Lisa and that he was severely beaten by Steinberg
and Ms. Nussbaum.
   The source said Green admitted in interviews with prosecutors
that his statement was a ploy to use against his wife in their
divorce.
   The Greens, who Ms. Nussbaum said joined her and Steinberg in
cocaine parties, have since reconciled and live near Harrisburg, Pa.
   When asked by a reporter Wednesday about Ms. Nussbaum's
allegations, Green replied, ``They're unfounded.'' He said ``a good
percentage'' of her testimony was untrue.
   Ms. Nussbaum made the allegation of sexual abuse under
cross-examination by Steinberg's lawyer, Ira London.

   Here are some facts and figures on Armenia, the southern Soviet
republic where a devastating earthquake killed thousands of people.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Armenia is a mountainous republic covering 11,490
square miles, an area similar in size to the state Maryland. It is
bordered by Turkey on the west, the Georgian Soviet republic to the
north and the Azerbaijan Soviet republic to the east. To the south
lie Iran and the Soviet republic of Nakhichevan. The capital of
Armenia is Yerevan.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The population is 3.3 million, about 90 percent
Armenian, most of whom are Christian. About 5 percent are
Azerbaijani, 2.3 percent Russian and 1.7 percent Kurd.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Mining is an important industry, and Armenia has
large deposits of metals and minerals. Other industries are
chemicals, textiles and wine-making.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Armenia was proclaimed a Soviet socialist republic on
Nov. 29, 1920. In February, Armenians began agitating for annexation
of the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region in
Azerbaijan. The protest caused anti-Armenian riots in cities in
predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan, and so far the unrest has resulted
in about 60 confirmed deaths.

<HEAD>China Welcomes Soviet Troop Reduction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China said Thursday it welcomed Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's decision to cut Red Army troops by nearly 10
percent and pull back some troops from the Chinese border in
Mongolia.
   ``This is a positive development,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Li
Zhaoxing told a news conference.
   Asked if it enhanced prospects for next year's proposed
Chinese-Soviet summit, Li said: ``The Soviet Union indicated it now
has the intention to clear away all the obstacles standing in the
way of normalization of Chinese-Soviet relations. We hope the Soviet
Union will take further practical steps to eliminate all the
obstacles once and for all as soon as possible.''
   Gorbachev made the announcement Wednesday in a speech to the
United Nations. He said the Soviet army, estimated by Western
experts at 5.6 million soldiers, would be cut by 500,000 in the next
two years and ``a major portion of Soviet troops temporarily
stationed (in Mongolia) will return home.''
   Troops also will be pulled out of Eastern Europe, he said.
   China long has demanded that the Soviet Union reduce its troop
presence along their border as a condition for normalizing relations
after nearly 30 years of estrangement.
   The Soviet Union stations nearly 50,000 troops in Mongolia, which
has been a close ally since declaring independence from China and
establishing a socialist government in 1921. The Soviets pulled
about 12,000 soldiers out of Mongolia in 1987, and China since has
focused on other issues in its normalization talks with the Soviets.
   However, Li said Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told Soviet
officials on his visit to Moscow last week that China hoped the
Soviets would pull all their troops from Mongolia and reduce their
border forces to ``a level commensurate with the normal standards of
good neighborly relations.''
   Li said, ``The Soviet side indicated that the process of
withdrawal of troops from Mongolia will be continued.''
   Relations between China and the Soviet Union, long at odds over
ideological and strategic issues, have warmed considerably in the
past year. Both sides said during Qian's visit that the first
Chinese-Soviet summit since 1959 could be held next year. A specific
date has not been set.
   In addition to a Soviet troop reduction along the border, China's
longstanding conditions for normalizing relations are a Soviet
pullout from Afghanistan and Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia.
   The Soviets began withdrawing from Afghanistan in May, and have
agreed to work for a settlement of the Cambodia issue.
   China maintains that Vietnam could not continue its decade-long
occupation of Cambodia without Soviet aid.
   Li did not respond directly when asked if a summit could be held
while Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia, but said, ``Preparations
for the meeting have already been started.''

   Border police seized two suitcases of

said Thursday.
   The luggage was not claimed by anyone, said Lt. Raffaele Ditroia
of the Finance Police, which guards the border.
   The suitcases contained two submachine guns, two semiautomatic
rifles and more than 100 boxes of ammunition, police said.
   Witnesses said a man got on the train at the border town of
Chiasso, Switzerland, on Tuesday night, put the suitcases in the
luggage rack in a second-class compartment and got off, police said.
   Italian border police doing routine luggage checks discovered the
arms.
   No one tried to claim the bags when the train from arrived in
Milan and no arrests were made, Ditroia said.

   The Senate's top appointed officials will keep
their jobs in the upcoming 101th Congress, Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell said Thursday.
   Walter J. ``Joe'' Stewart, secretary of the Senate the past two
years, will remain in that post. He previously served as secretary
for the majority from 1979 until 1981, when Republicans took control
of the chamber and he became secretary for the minority. He later
resigned to work in private business, returning to the Senate as its
chief administrative and financial officer in 1987.
   Henry K. Giugni will return as sergeant-at-arms and doorkeeper, a
position he has held for two years. The sergeant-at-arms is the
chief law enforcement and protocol officer of the Senate.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, who was elected majority leader by fellow
Democratic senators last week, also announced that C. Abbott
``Abby'' Saffold will remain as secretary for the majority and
Martha S. Pope will serve as chief of staff for the majority
leader's office.

   A judge today sentenced three black
leaders of the country's largest anti-apartheid group to prison
terms of 10 to 12 years after a highly publicized three-year treason
trial.
   ``I would rather err on the side of leniency,'' Judge Kees van
Dijkhorst said as he sentenced Patrick Lekota, 40, the publicity
secretary for the United Democratic Front, to 12 years for treason.
   Popo Molefe, 36, the front's national secretary, and Moses
Chikane, 40, Transvaal Province branch secretary, each received 10
years for treason.
   A person convicted of treason can be sentenced to death in South
Africa.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu described the sentences as
vicious. The U.S. Embassy called the judgment regrettable because
the defendants were ``men of good will working peacefully for a
non-racial, democratic South Africa.''
   Thomas Manthata, 48, a church field worker, also was sentenced to
six years in jail for treason.
   Supporters raised clenched fists in the courtroom and shouted,
``Viva!'' Then the audience and defendants sang ``God Bless
Africa,'' the anthem of the anti-apartheid movement.
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, the front's acting national secretary, said
the sentences were ``extremely harsh when you take into account
these are non-violent people who were engaged in peaceful protest.''
   Van Dijkhorst ruled that the United Democratic Front was a
revolutionary organization which collaborated with the outlawed
African National Congress to incite anti-government violence in 1984.
   Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak were named as unindicted
co-conspirators with more than 900 other front supporters.
   ``It's a vicious sentence,'' said Tutu. ``I myself will certainly
be very, very involved in ensuring that I leave no stone unturned in
overturning that conviction and sentence.''
   Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches,
said he had been involved in consumer boycotts just like the
sentenced men.
   ``If you allow this to happen that means that we will concede
that everything we have been doing is criminal, is illegal, is
wrong, is treasonous,'' Boesak said.
   Human rights activist Max Coleman said the sentences were lighter
than expected to fit a recent government policy of projecting a
softer image. But he said ``what would be legitimate protest in most
countries is a crime here.''
   Of seven other defendants, convicted of terrorism, six received
suspended five-year prison terms and the other was sentenced to
serve five years. Those with suspended sentences were banned for two
years from talking to the press, attending public meetings or
participating in politics.
   Van Dijkhorst said he was lenient because, ``None have been found
guilty of planning or executing direct violence.''
   Defense lawyer George Bizos had argued for suspended sentences,
noting most defendants had spent at least three years in prison.
   The trial began in 1985 in Delmas farm town and later shifted to
Pretoria. Eleven of the original 22 defendants were acquitted at
various stages.
   Ambassadors from the United States, Britain, France and West
Germany were among spectators packed into the courtroom.
   Several leading opponents of South Africa's system of racial
segregation, including novelist Nadine Gordimer, testified for the
defendants.
   Able to speak freely because restrictions on anti-government
statements do not apply in the courtroom, the witnesses voiced
support for the ANC and refused to condemn its use of violence.
   The sentences came the day after the government transferred ANC
leader Nelson Mandela to a comfortable home on a prison farm. It was
the first time since 1962 that he has been out of a cell, except for
hospital stays.

<HEAD>Hunthausen Hopes To Regain Control Over Seattle Archdiocese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberal Roman Catholic Archbishop Raymond
Hunthausen said Vatican officials have indicated he will regain full
control of the Seattle archdiocese.
   Hunthausen, who returned Tuesday from a week in Rome, said he was
``hoping for some kind of a statement'' within weeks that will
officially end the Vatican's direct assistance to the archdiocese.
   But a conservative Catholic group charged Wednesday that
violations of church practices are continuing and said it will not
let up in its criticism.
   ``I haven't seen a great change here,'' Margaret Hoffman,
director of the Sons of St. Peter Coalition, said Wednesday. ``I've
seen things happen currently that are not in line with church
teaching. I think we as laymen have a duty to report abuses ... for
the health of the church.''
   Hunthausen's weeklong visit to Rome was to fulfill the
requirement that bishops consult with the pope every five years.
   The archbishop ran afoul of the Vatican in 1983 over the granting
of annulments and general absolution of sins, intercommunion with
Protestants and opening of churches to meetings of homosexual
Catholics.
   A Vatican investigation resulted in the archbishop being stripped
of much of his power. Although Hunthausen's full powers were
restored in May 1987 on the recommendation of an apostolic
commission appointed by Rome, the panel continued to assist in the
operation of the Seattle archdiocese.
   Most recently, Hunthausen has shared authority with Coadjutor
Archbishop Thomas J. Murphy, who accompanied Hunthausen to Rome to
present Pope John Paul II and Vatican officials an overview of
changes made and planned in the ministry.
   Hunthausen said there would be no visible changes in the way he
handles the archdiocese's operations, now that some changes and
clarifications have been made or at least initiated.
   An archdiocesan statement said Vatican officials also were told
Hunthausen's critics appear ``bent on undoing the fabric of unity
that exists among sincere and conscientious believers within the
Body of Christ. ... In our judgment, their criticism ought not to be
given serious attention.''
   Hunthausen said Wednesday the ``small cadre'' of critics within
the archdiocese are ``people with a different view of the church.''
   ``We'd love to be able to find a way to minister to them,'' he
said.

   Thousands may have cheered Mikhail Gorbachev as
he sped through the city in his motorcade, but the Soviet leader got
a more doleful dose of free speech from about 1,000 demonstrators
outside the United Nations.
   Fifty-six people from the Students Struggle for Soviet Jewry were
arrested after they crossed police barricades and sat in the street
outside the U.N. on Wednesday to protest the treatment of Jews in
the Soviet Union. They were taken away in vans, charged with
disorderly conduct and released.
   Other protesters included Ukrainians, Armenians and supporters of
dissidents in the Baltic states, where nationalism has been on the
rise.
   Many speakers at the demonstration, including city Comptroller
Harrison Goldin, called on Gorbachev to push for human rights as
well as glasnost, his policy of openness.
   ``We hope that as (Gorbachev) pursues glasnost he will be equally
vigorous in implementing a fundamental human freedom: the right to
emigrate and freely practice one's religion,'' said Goldin. ``For
Jews, that is fundamental.''
   Another speaker, Rabbi Haskel Lookstein, said, ``We appreciate
the initial steps ... but there's much more to be done.''
   Franklin Smiles, a rabbinical student, was asked if he thought
Gorbachev _ who stepped directly from his limousine to the U.N.
building _ even heard the demonstrators' message.
   ``It's more important that it reaches Americans,'' he said,
explaining that they can pressure U.S. officials to pressure their
Soviet counterparts.
   Several hundred Eastern European emigres demonstrated on the
other side of the street. A group of Ukrainians, many of them
elderly, waved Ukrainian flags in favor of independence from the
Soviet Union.
   Members of an Estonian group waved their national flag and
chanted ``One two three four, open up the iron door.'' Estonia
recently declared limited autonomy from the Soviet Union.
   Arunas Degutis, 30, editor of an opposition newspaper in
Lithuania, was not particularly impressed with the turnout. He said
that 250,000 people were at the last demonstration he attended in
Lithuania, and that 10,000 protesters can be mobilized there with
two hours' notice.
   More than 100 Armenian-Americans protested Gorbachev's handling
of ethnic unrest in the neighboring republics of Azerbaijan and
Armenia.
   ``The extent to which glasnost ... will truly offer democracy has
yet to be seen,'' said an organizer, Dr. Ara Caprielian. ``Talking
about the past and getting something today are two different
things.''
   Groups of Armenian and Jewish protesters also gathered outside
the Soviet mission, where Gorbachev spent two nights. They chanted,
sang and made speeches.
   About 4:30 a.m. today, two people who tried to set up a banner
near the mission were arrested when they ignored a police order to
move, said Sgt. Ed Burns, a police spokesman. They were given
disorderly conduct tickets and released.
   Later, six Armenian clergymen hoping to see Gorbachev were
allowed through police barricades and into the mission. The most
prominent among them were identified by police as Torkom Manoogian,
archbishop of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church in North
America and Archbishop Vazken Keshirshian, primate of the Armenian
Church in Canada. They left nearly an hour later, saying they had
not met with Gorbachev.
   The Soviet leader was forced to leave New York a day early today
because of a devastating earthquake in the Soviet south, Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said.

   Ulanhu, vice chairman of the National People's
Congress who fought for native Mongolian rights during his more than
60-year political career, died Thursday. He was 82.
   Ulanhu died in Beijing after being hospitalized for an
unspecified illness, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   He worked for Inner Mongolia's independence from
Nationalist-ruled China in the 1930s and also fought Japanese
efforts to occupy Inner Mongolia. He also served as personal
secretary to a Chinese warlord in the region and did underground
work for the Chinese Communist Party.
   After the party's victory in 1949, Ulanhu held a series of posts
in the central government, including vice premier.
   He also was appointed government chairman, party secretary and
army commander in Inner Mongolia and ruled the vast barren region
virtually single-handedly for nearly two decades before being
toppled in 1967 during the Cultural Revolution.
   As Inner Mongolia's top official, Ulanhu urged China's majority
Han nationality to respect the rights of the country's minorities,
including the Mongols.
   When radical youth groups called Red Guards tried to take over
Inner Mongolian government offices in 1967, Ulanhu used his troops
against them. Leftist leaders in Beijing finally sent in outside
troops to remove Ulanhu from office on charges of having made
himself ``ruler in an independent kingdom.''
   Ulanhu's supporters in Inner Mongolia fought the outside troops
for months, calling themselves the Genghis Khan Combat Corps, in
honor of the 13th century Mongolian general who conquered much of
Central Asia, including parts of China.
   After being rehabilitated in 1973, Ulanhu held posts in the
party's top policy-making bodies, the Central Committee and the
Politburo, but was never returned to office in Inner Mongolia. He
also led numerous delegations overseas in the late 1970s.
   He has served as a vice chairman on the National People's
Congress, the legislature, since 1975. Currently there are 18 other
vice chairmen.
   He retired last year at the 13th National Party Congress.
   Ulanhu was ``a long-tested veteran communist, an outstanding
party and state leader and a proletarian revolutionary as well as a
noted guide of minority-nationality affairs,'' said Xinhua, quoting
an obituary issued by the party.
   He was born in 1906 in Inner Mongolia to an aristocratic family.
He was educated in Moscow and Beijing, where he joined the Communist
Youth League in 1923 and the Communist Party soon after.

   Red Cross workers fearful of food riots
have held off distributing relief supplies to thousands of Sudanese
who lived for months on grass, roots and leaves after fleeing civil
war, an official said Thursday.
   Food flown to the area for the past five days is being stored to
ensure adequate supply when workers begin handing it out, said
Pierre Pont, the Khartoum representative of the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
   ``We couldn't start mass distribution until we had stockpiled
enough food, or else there would be riots,'' said Pont, who flew
with Wednesday's Hercules C-130 flight to Wau, a government-held
southern city surrounded by rebels.
   Pont said the only food distributed so far has gone to hospital
patients, children in an orphanage and other small ``vulnerable''
groups.
   The rebels in the predominantly animist and Christian south are
fighting a 5-year-old war for social reform and autonomy from the
Moslem-dominated government in the north. Relief flights to the
south began Sunday after the rebels dropped their threat to shoot
down the planes, but recent rebel attacks on relief convoys have
been reported.
   Beginning Sunday, the C-130 carried 18 tons of food at a time
from Khartoum to Wau, 625 miles to the southwest, and flights from
Kenya took food and medicine to rebel-held towns in the bush, Pont
said.
   Another airlift, organized by the United Nations, is using
smaller planes to take food to Aweil, 45 miles northwest of Wau.
   ``Wau is lacking in everything,'' Pont said in an interview. ``It
is a dramatic situation there, but you don't see people dying in the
streets any more.''
   Before the current airlift, he said, the last relief shipment
arrived six or seven months ago in Wau, whose population swelled to
100,000 from its normal 50,000-60,000 because of people displaced
over the summer.
   ``They survived by eating roots, leaves and grass,'' said Pont.
``The old people and the children were the worst affected.''
   But, he said, ``all goes well with the airlift. We are confident
that eventually the displaced can be fed and slowly we can improve
the nutrition status.''
   In Wau as elsewhere, most of the displaced people have returned
to the countryside to harvest wild rice. Cole Dodge, Khartoum
representative of the U.N. children's relief organization UNICEF,
said the crop is good enough to produce stocks that will last until
next year's early-summer rainy season.
   The Red Cross has 10,000 tons of relief supplies in Sudan, where
relief workers estimate half a million of the 6 million southerners
died this year from the war and the famine it induced. U.N.
officials say conditions have deteriorated to such an extent that
famine is sure to strike again with the rains in 1989.
   The airlift is the first since Sudan's civil war began in early
1983 that has its safety guaranteed by the government and the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   The rebels have shot down three civilian aircraft since 1986,
killing more than 70 people. Until now, they had threatened to fire
on any aircraft in the south that was not carrying supplies for
rebel-held areas.
   Aweil, normally home to 30,000 people, grew to 90,000 over the
summer, when rains isolated it from the outside. Pont said it has
received no relief help in more than a year, and 8,000 people are
thought to have died there.
   Unlike Wau, a city with buildings, Aweil is a ``real African
village with lots of African huts,'' said Pont, who also flew there
on Wednesday. ``It's very pretty.''
   Pont said Aweil's village market is functioning, but the only
food its merchants offer is roots and peanuts.
   Also Thursday, the U.N. World Food Program announced that food
aid worth $5.4 million will be sent to some 370,000 nomadic
shepherds in northeast Sudan. The Rome-based agency said the
shepherds lost most of their animals during the 1983-85 drought and
are now rebuilding their herds.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev urgently headed for home today to cope with
the crisis of a devastating earthquake, expressing confidence that
superpower relations were on track after a summit with President
Reagan and President-elect Bush. The American leaders expressed
condolences and offered U.S. assistance.
   Gorbachev, standing on a windswept runway at John F. Kennedy
International Airport, said his talks with Reagan and Bush in New
York on Wednesday and by telephone today made him confident ``that
our relations will expand and improve on the basis of cooperation,
on the basis of mutual respect for each others' interests.''
   The Soviet leader said, ``The road ahead will be tough but we
will go ahead.''
   Soviet officials said Gorbachev cut short his New York visit, and
scrapped stops in Cuba and Britain, because of an earthquake in
Soviet Armenia that killed thousands of people. Gorbachev said there
were ``extremely grave consequences, devastation and great loss of
life. I urgently have to return to the Soviet Union.''
   During a visit of less than 48 hours in Manhattan, Gorbachev drew
praise from Reagan and Bush for his announcement of a unilateral,
500,000-man reduction in Soviet troops and cutbacks in artillery,
tanks and planes.
   Expressing gratitude to Reagan and Bush for U.S. offers of
earthquake help, Gorbachev said, ``I would like to thank them and
thank the American people for those feelings and for their readiness
to give assistance in this difficult hour.''
   Reagan, in his farewell telephone call, expressed ``deep personal
sorrow'' over the earthquake tragedy. The president, speaking from
his second-floor living quarters in the White House, also told
Gorbachev their meeting on Wednesday was ``very useful ... for both
sides.''
   He expressed concern over the magnitude of the Soviet loss. ``If
there is any way we can be of assistance, either bilaterally or
through the international community, please let me know,'' Reagan
said. His comments were relayed to the press by White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Nancy Reagan also spoke with Raisa Gorbachev, expressing sorrow
over the quake and saying she and the president hope to see the
Gorbachevs again, either in California or the Soviet Union.
   Soviet officials said Gorbachev was returning home to direct
relief efforts after the quake in Armenia that produced casualties
numbering in the thousands. That meant junking an elaborately
planned day of sightseeing in New York, as well as trips to Cuba and
England that had been on the schedule for later in the week.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, standing outside 10
Downing Street with the Soviet ambassador to London, endorsed
Gorbachev's decision to cut off his trip. ``Obviously his place is
at home at this time,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   At least one event planned for the Soviet leader went on without
him. A Soviet trade show opened, with goods ranging from vodka to
furs and to fruits on display. Viktor Kamentsev, a deputy Soviet
premier, opened the show along with C. William Verity, the U.S.
secretary of commerce.
   Gorbachev was making his hasty exit from New York while Western
leaders were trying to digest his announcement of a cut of 500,000
troops, including withdrawal of 50,000 from Eastern Europe.
   Reagan and Bush both heartily embraced the announcement when it
was made on Wednesday.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz met today with NATO allies to
try to persuade them to insist on further cutbacks in Soviet troops
in Europe beyond those Gorbachev has offered to withdraw from East
Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   In his farewell meeting with the 15 foreign ministers, Shultz
hoped to keep the allies focused on the 2-to-1 manpower edge U.S.
officials say the Warsaw Pact still enjoys.
   Gorbachev's early departure was an unexpected ending to the
Soviet leader's New York visit.
   He melted diplomatic reserve at the United Nations with a
sweeping disarmament pledge, met cordially for two hours with Bush
and Reagan and even managed a quick motorcade tour of Manhattan,
jumping from his limousine to greet startled New Yorkers on the
sidewalk.
   The Soviets said concern for his people, rather than any
political developments in his homeland, caused Gorbachev to cancel
further sightseeing in New York today and subsequent stops in Cuba
and Britain.
   Reagan, Bush and Gorbachev all were in high spirits when they met
for two hours on heavily guarded Governors Island in New York
Harbor. When Bush offered a welcoming handshake, Gorbachev seized it
in a two-handed embrace.
   After two hours of talks, Reagan summed up the mood. ``Read our
smiles,'' the outgoing president said.
   Gorbachev and his wife Raisa then went on a 75-minute motorcade
tour of Manhattan from Wall Street to Times Square, with the Soviet
leader twice stopping to greet New Yorkers on the streets. As
everyone in the city had anticipated, his 45-car motorcade left
behind a snarl of traffic.
   Extending an olive branch to Bush, Gorbachev said in his speech
at the United Nations that the new administration ``will find in us
a partner who is ready _ without long pauses or backtracking _ to
continue the dialogue in a spirit of realism, openness and
goodwill.''
   In a similar vein, Bush said he told Gorbachev at a luncheon with
Reagan that he wanted ``to continue the progress that's been made.''
But Bush, who will not take office until Jan. 20, said he would not
rush to set up his own summit with Gorbachev.
   ``I enjoyed the meeting; hope to see you soon,'' Bush said with a
final handshake for Gorbachev.
   Beset by economic problems at home, Gorbachev used his U.N.
address to announce a unilateral cutback in Soviet troops,
artillery, tanks and planes, including a reduction of 50,000 Red
Army forces and 5,000 tanks in Eastern Europe by 1991. Overall, he
said the reductions would total 500,000 troops _ or about 10 percent
of the total _ in Soviet territory and bordering nations.
   Gorbachev said money saved by scaling down military forces would
be invested in the Soviet civilian economy.
   ``It is now quite clear that building up military power makes no
country omnipotent,'' Gorbachev said. ``What's more, one-sided
reliance on military power ultimately weakens other components of
national security.''
   Gorbachev urged the United States and its allies to ``take
certain steps'' in reply to the troop cutback, but did not specify
them.
   Reagan said ``I heartily approve'' of the Soviet cutback but made
no promise that the U.S. would reciprocate. In a speech after his
return to Washington, Reagan discussed Gorbachev's move and said,
``if it is carried out speedily and in full, history will regard it
as important, significant.''
   Reagan was expected to elaborate tonight at a nationally
broadcast news conference from the White House.

   Hurricane-force Santa Ana winds fanned fires that destroyed 25
houses in Southern California and forced hundreds of people to flee
their homes today. Winds gusting to 80 mph knocked out power to
thousands and toppled a partly built apartment building.
   In Colorado, a wintry storm dumped up to 15 inches of snow,
causing rush-hour traffic jams, dozens of accidents and the deaths
of best-selling novelist Terrence Smith and another motorist,
authorities said.
   Snow continued falling today in Colorado, as well as in western
Texas, New Mexico and parts of Arizona.
   No serious injuries were reported in Southern California due to
the hot, desert Santa Ana winds, which are expected to continue
through Friday. But streets and yards were littered with snapped
tree limbs and sparking power lines.
   The worst fires were in the Los Angeles suburb of Baldwin Park,
where a fire destroyed 15 homes and damaged five commercial
buildings, and in the east Los Angeles County community of La Verne,
where fire destroyed 10 homes and damaged up to 15.
   The blaze in Baldwin Park, a suburb 20 miles northeast of
downtown, was contained at daybreak as the winds abated, said Los
Angeles County fire Inspector Chuck Gutierrez.
   The blaze broke out shortly after midnight, when power lines
snapped by 75 mph gusts ignited paper at a paper plant, firefighters
said. The wind quickly spread the embers through commercial
buildings, including a lumber yard and a Shell Oil distribution
center, and into a neighborhood of modest single-family homes.
   Approximately 100 residents were evacuated from the neighborhood.
   ``Two homes next to us caught fire like a match and I'm sure ours
is on fire too,'' said Hector Salas, 22. ``You know, all of us
around here, we don't have much. My father and mother were barely
making it, and now it's all gone.''
   Phil Estupinion, who shared a house with eight other relatives,
said he returned to his home about an hour after being told by
police to get out.
   ``And the house was gone,'' he said. ``It wasn't there. It was
all burned up.''
   In La Verne, a suburb up against the dry San Gabriel Mountains 30
miles east of Los Angeles, some 300 people were evacuated from the
neighborhood of $200,000 homes after the blaze began near a boys'
home. The fire was contained after scorching 150 acres of brush.
   ``It literally rained embers across roofs,'' said La Verne
firefighter Ron Sillo.
   ``We lost everything _ the house, the cars,'' said Dan Hanlon,
49, who fled with his wife, Jackie, down a fiery hillside. ``We were
lucky to get out. We had to drive through flames.''
   In Glendale, 10 miles north of Los Angeles, a wind-driven fire
raced along a ridge, blackening about 100 acres of brush,
threatening about 30 homes and prompting evacuation of about 50
people.
   Power was blacked out as winds snapped power lines. About 300,000
Southern California Edison customers were without electricity at one
time or another, said company spokesman Dave Barron.
   Hundreds of West Los Angeles residents were evacuated late
Wednesday when the wind spread embers from a burning apartment house
project to a nearby complex, said fire department spokesman Greg
Acevedo.
   The fire raged for nearly two hours, displacing occupants of the
four-story building as flames climbed hundreds of feet into the air.
   The Los Angeles County Fire Department placed firefighters on
standby in the parched canyon areas of Malibu and Lancaster in case
fires flared, and a red-flag alert was called by the U.S. Forest
Service in the Angeles National Forest.
   Rancho Cucamonga, where winds were clocked at 80 mph, appeared to
be the hardest hit Wednesday. The winds knocked down a three-story
apartment building under construction and blew the roofs off at
least two homes, officials said.
   ``I always wanted a room with a skylight,'' Dolores Salazar said
ruefully as she regarded the damage to her home.
   Small fires were reported throughout the night in Rancho
Cucamonga, but all were controlled, said city emergency services
coordinator Marti Higgins.
   Wind-fanned flames in Hollywood gutted a two-story home and
leaped to a neighboring residence Wednesday, said Acevedo.
   The gusts blew a tree onto a car in the Orange County city of
Santa Ana, and knocked over a 30-foot motor home on the Foothill
Freeway near San Dimas, causing a traffic jam.
   In Colorado, the storm was subsiding in most areas today after
leaving 15 inches of snow west of Fort Collins, 4 inches in Colorado
Springs and Denver and 2 inches in Pueblo.
   Flights were delayed at Stapleton International Airport in Denver
about 90 minutes throughout the day Wednesday, but it was back to
normal today, said airport spokesman Richard Boulware.
   Roads that were wet Wednesday morning were sheets of ice by
afternoon before being covered by snow, producing evening rush-hour
traffic jams in the Denver area, Boulder and Fort Collins.
   ``It's a total mess everywhere,'' said Denver police Sgt. Milt
Gras.
   Smith, 46, of Woodland Park and a 42-year-old Woodmoor woman were
killed in separate accidents, authorities said. Smith, author of
``The Thief Who Came To Dinner'' and several other novels, died when
his van spun on ice on U.S. 24 and hit a car.
   There were 38 accidents in Fort Collins alone by 8 p.m., and in
Denver motorists were asked to report minor crack-ups later.
   For the homeless at the Samaritan Shelter north of downtown
Denver, the storm meant more than discomfort.
   Danna Morgan, 22, a single mother, struggled to keep her
11-month-old son warm. ``You have to leave (shelters) early in the
morning, unless you are on the sick list. ... We walk around in the
snow,'' she said.

   Thirteen miners suffocated in a coal mine fire
because they had not been trained to use their emergency oxygen
equipment, a newspaper said Thursday.
   Some of the dead from the September accident were found clutching
the emergency tanks in their hands, the Workers' Daily reported,
quoting the China General Corporation of State-Run Coal Mines.
   Investigators discovered that the victims had tried
unsuccessfully to use their equipment, which included a two-hour
oxygen supply, the newspaper said.
   The fire occurred in the Feng Feng Mine Bureau's Xuecun Mine in
Hebei province, about 250 miles south of Beijing. The Workers' Daily
reported it for the first time Thursday, but did not say why it had
not been reported earlier.
   The paper said the mine had not made a serious effort to train
its contract workers _ those hired temporarily. It said other recent
mine accidents revealed that contract miners lacked even the most
basic safety training.
   Huang Yicheng, minister of energy resources, said this week that
more than 100 people were killed in coal mine accidents in November,
the highest monthly total this year.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservative think tank weighed in Thursday
with 927 pages of recommendations for President-elect Bush on how to
run the government, including a freeze on government spending and
dismissal of staff members who deviate from administration policies.
   Leaders of the Heritage Foundation said their third quadrennial
``Mandate for Leadership'' book contains more than 2,000
recommendations from 400 experts, many veterans of the Reagan-Bush
administration.
   Heritage President Edwin Feulner Jr. told a news conference that
based on the influence of the 1980 and 1984 books on Ronald Reagan,
``We can confidently predict that the Bush administration ... will
pay close attention to these recommendations.''
   Several top Bush administration officials, including Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle, have already been briefed on the
recommendations, and Bush will get his own copy of the book Friday,
Feulner said.
   The book recommends a harder-nosed approach on holding down
federal spending, including subjecting all programs including Social
Security to the Gramm-Rudman deficit ceiling law. It urges Bush to
propose a freeze on spending, and to base his budget blueprint on a
freeze, not on current services.
   The president is required by law to submit a current services
budget, which sets forth what it would cost to maintain government
services and programs in the next budget year, taking inflation into
account and before any proposals for cuts.
   Charles L. Heatherly, a Heritage vice president and co-editor of
the book, complained that the current services approach ``determines
the whole way the debate is framed.''
   Heatherly said Bush should ``fire somebody, anybody, for not
staying in line with official administration policies'' early in his
presidency.
   He said Bush should also move quickly to figure out who his
friends and enemies in Congress are, rewarding the friends and
giving the enemies the cold shoulder.
   It is essential that Bush have at least a reliable core of
one-third-plus-one members of both the House and Senate to sustain
his vetos, Heatherly said.
   ``The veto will be the only trump card,'' he said.
   The book repeats a host of Heritage positions including letting
workers opt out of Social Security in favor of private retirement
accounts, pressing ahead with President Reagan's Star Wars missile
defense system, and renewing military aid to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   This ``Mandate'' is actually 166 pages shorter than the 1980
tome, which ran 1,093 pages. ``Mandate for Leadership II,'' in
Reagan's midterm, ran 565 pages.

   A sharply divided commission concluded today that
ice on the wings of a military plane caused the crash that killed
248 U.S. soldiers returning home for Christmas nearly three years
ago.
   However, four of the nine panel members wrote a separate minority
opinion saying the crash Dec. 12, 1985 at Gander, Newfoundland, was
probably caused by a fire that may have been started by an explosion
aboard the plane.
   The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Army and
the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration participated in the probe,
but the ultimate responsibility for the report lies with the nine
Canadian board members.
   The report by the Canadian Aviation Safety Board_ which was
signed by five members, including Chairman Kenneth J. Thorneycroft _
discounted terrorism and fire as causes of the disaster.
   The minority opinion, signed by four members, said witnesses saw
fire coming from the Arrow Air charter DC-8 before it crashed
shortly after takeoff.
   The plane was taking the soldiers home to Fort Campbell, Ky. They
were returning from the Middle East, where they were on a
peacekeeping mission.
   All those aboard the plane, including eight American crew
members, were killed in Canada's worst air disaster.
   Members of the board often argued publicly during the
investigation, leading opposition politicians to call for a judicial
review of the crash.
   The board's report says the aircraft stalled at low altitude
shortly afer takeoff and recovery was not possible.
   ``The most probable cause of the stall was ... ice contamination
on the leading edge and upper surface of the wing,'' it said.
   ``Other possible factors, such as a loss of thrust from the No. 4
engine and inappropriate takeoff reference speeds, may have
compounded the effects of the contamination,'' the report said.
   It said the evidence ``did not support the occurrence of a
preimpact fire or explosion either accidental or as a result of
sabotage.''
   It also found that the crew's December flight schedule was heavy,
and they may have been suffering from fatigue.
   The minority opinion said ``ice contamination was not a factor in
this accident.'' It did not blame terrorism but said that security
arrangements at the flight's point of origin in Cairo, Egypt, ``were
not ideal.''
   It said, ``Fire broke out on board while the aircraft was in
flight, possibly due to a detonation in a cargo compartment.''
   The minority opinion found ``members of the cockpit crew
performed their duties without apparent fault.'' It said there was
no basis for supposing fatigue might have affected the crew's
performance.

   Two boys have won spots on the
cheerleading squad at a middle school, resolving a sex
discrimination dispute that arose after school officials said
tryouts were for girls only.
   Three boys tried out last week for the Har-Bur Middle School team
that will cheer at basketball games, but administrators told them
the school had not planned for a coeducational squad.
   Brett Jeans and his friend Sean Cole then called television
stations and newspapers, which contacted school officials. By
Monday, administrators relented after consulting School
Superintendent James Schmidt.
   Of six boys at Wednesday's tryouts, two were chosen, said
Schmidt, who would not identify them. One was among the first group
of boys who tried out.
   Jeans, 13, said he had a good reason for trying to break the
gender barrier.
   ``I'm not that good at basketball,'' said Jeans, who spent the
fall as player-manager of the soccer team. ``I wanted to do
something, so I decided to try out for the cheerleading squad.''

   South Korea's production of motor
vehicles since the start of this year reached 1,000,660 as of
Thursday, hitting 1 million annually for the first time, automakers
reported.
   The tally is expected to reach 1.09 million vehicles by the
year's end, compared with the previous annual record of 979,739
vehicles in 1987, they said.
   A series of labor protests early this year reduced car production
by 200,000, but Korean automakers increased output in the latter
half to exceed the milestone, the industry officials said.
   The officials listed Hyundai Motor Co.'s production so far this
year at 594,645 vehicles, followed by Kia Motors Corp. with 225,267
and Daewoo Motor Co. with 150,047 vehicles. There are a few other
small automakers in South Korea.

Mikhail S. Gorbachev the United States stands ready to do whatever
it can in the aftermath of the devastating Armenian earthquake as
the Red Cross sent $50,000 and prepared to dispatch medical supplies.
   Reagan, in a telephone call to Gorbachev shortly before the
Soviet president flew home from New York to lead the recovery
effort, expressed Americans' sorrow and said, ``If there is any way
we can be of assistance, either bilaterally or through the
international community, please let me know.''
   As he left New York, Gorbachev thanked Reagan and ``the American
people for those feelings and for their readiness to give
assistance,'' but did not say what, if anything, the Soviets would
ask for.
   Meanwhile, the president of the American Red Cross said that
$50,000 had already been sent to aid in the relief efforts as ``an
immediate gift.''
   Richard F. Schubert, president of the organization, said that
members of the Armenian community in Los Angeles had already offered
to help.
   Donations, Schubert said in a statement, should be sent to local
chanters or to the American Red Cross, International Disaster
Relief, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, D.C., 20013, and marked
``Soviet-Armenian Earthquake.''
   ``We have agreed that just as soon as an assessment is made, we
will begin to supply their needs as we have the ability to do,''
Schubert said in an appearance on the television show ``CBS This
Morning.'' He said early indications are that the Soviets will need
large supplies of antibiotics.
   ``Soviet Red Cross officials reported a particular need for
blood, and more than 850 donations were taken from volunteers and
staff, students, workers and military personnel during the early
hours of the morning there,'' Schubert said in his statement. ``All
blood needs for the earthquake victims will be collected from
internal Soviet Union resources,'' he said.
   The temblor that devastated much of Soviet Armenia on Wednesday
leveled cities and killed thousands of people.
   One unconfirmed report put the number of dead at 70,000.
   The 16,000-resident town of Spitak, near the epicenter of the
tremor, was reportedly wiped out. The government newspaper Izvestia
said just one of the town's eight schools still stood.
   ``This is an incredible disaster,'' Schubert said, an event
``that would tax the resources of any society, including the Soviet
Red Cross.''
   Besides blood, Schubert said, the Soviets ``also have airlifted
in about 15 tons of blankets, tents, first aid kits.
   ``Armenia at this point in the year is pretty cold, and so there
is a critical need for emergency shelter,'' he explained.
   Schubert said that in addition to U.S. assistance, Soviet
officials have been in touch with the international League of Red
Cross Societies in Switzerland, which will coordinate aid programs.

   A high school honor roll student reported
missing for five days turned up in jail, where he had been since
giving a false name when arrested on car theft charges, authorities
said.
   Geraldo Garcia's parents had distributed posters throughout New
Haven and police issued a nationwide bulletin with his description
before learning on Wednesday that the 16-year-old was in jail.
   Garcia, who has no previous record, said he told police his name
was Geraldo Rivera when he was arrested Dec. 1 because he thought he
would get less prison time with a false name.
   Garcia said he tried to call home from jail Friday, but the line
was busy and he had no other chance to use a telephone.
   Deputy Assistant Public Defender Laurence Alterman, who
represented Garcia, said he suspected his client, who was being held
on $7,500 bail, might be the missing teen-ager after seeing a
television report Tuesday night.
   ``I don't know if he was just scared or embarrassed,'' Alterman
said. Garcia was unresponsive when questioned by court officials,
giving his family's old address as his own and incorrect telephone
numbers for relatives.
   An honor student at Wilbur Cross High School, Garcia insisted he
was a victim in the auto theft. He said an acquaintance told him a
car warming up in a driveway was his and asked Garcia to pull it out.
   Police said the car's owner jumped into another car, followed
Garcia and cut him off. Garcia was arrested on charges of
first-degree larceny, conspiracy to commit second-degree larceny and
driving a car without a license.

<HEAD>AMA Says It Will Go Ahead with Plans for New Type of Hospital Worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Medical Association officials say they are
going ahead with plans to establish training programs for a new type
of hospital worker who would provide bedside care.
   The decision came Wednesday, despite objections from some members
of the association's 422-member House of Delegates, the group's
policy-making body.
   Called a ``registered care technologist,'' or RCT, the new worker
category also has been opposed by the nursing profession.
   Lucille Joel, president of the American Nurses Association, told
an AMA committee Monday that her organization would not cooperate.
   Ms. Joel and other nursing leaders have argued that RCTs, trained
to provide bedside care such as emptying bedpans or delivering
meals, would only duplicate work already performed by nurse's aides
and licensed vocational nurses.
   Hospitals should instead hire more workers to stock cabinets and
perform other tasks unrelated to patient care that have fallen upon
nurses, Ms. Joel said.
   But Dr. James Sammons, executive vice president of the AMA, said
Wednesday that just because the nurses association doesn't want to
cooperate doesn't mean that nurses don't want to.
   ``I'm sorry Lucille said that, because she now has driven the
wedge even deeper,'' Sammons said at a news conference after the
final session of the House of Delegates semiannual meeting in Dallas.
   ``RCT is not a nurse. It's not meant to be a nurse, and it's not
meant to replace a nurse,'' said AMA trustee Dr. Joseph Painter, a
vice president of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
   An RCT advisory committee made up of doctors, nurses and hospital
officials will convene in January. Painter said the first pilot
program should begin by mid-1989.
   While the AMA delegates agreed that they must investigate
short-term and long-term solutions to the national nursing shortage,
the New York delegation proposed dropping any reference to RCTs.
   ``Basically, we have a big problem with the inflammatory term of
registered care technologist,'' said a New York delegate, Dr.
Richard Eberle of Syracuse.
   In what appeared to be a close show of hands, the House of
Delegates defeated New York's proposal to drop the term RCT. The AMA
tallies votes only at the request of the speaker of the House of
Delegates.

<HEAD>Pythons Found Moving Into Neighborhood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OLDSMAR, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The seventh large python snake found
slithering around the same neighborhood has officials puzzled, but
not panicked.
   Experts are not sure where the snakes have come from, but say
rodents are in far more danger than residents.
   The latest python to be spotted in the 20-block area was captured
Wednesday. All seven snakes have been either full-grown Burmese
pythons or reticulated pythons from Southeast Asia, averaging 12 to
15 feet in length and weighing up to 175 pounds, said Debbie Parker
of Wildlife Rescue and Rehab Inc., a St. Petersburg facility that
cares for injured or abandoned wild animals.
   But because they are not aggressive and appear well-fed, Parker
believes they may have been turned loose by their owner.
   ``We're talking about big, big snakes, as big around as my leg,''
Parker said. ``If I lived in the area, I'd be worried. They're big
enough to eat a small child.''
   Pythons are constrictor snakes and suffocate prey, normally small
mammals such as raccoons and opossums.
   Burmese pythons are unlikely to attack people and should flee
when confronted by humans, said Patrick Parisi, president of the
West Coast Herpetological Society. He said such a snake would have
to be starving before it would attack a child for food.
   But pythons have small, sharp teeth that can inflict a painful
bite, he said. They also have a natural fear of falling that could
cause them to coil around anyone who attempts to pick them up.
   Reticulated pythons are the world's largest snakes, reaching
lengths of up to 36 feet. Burmese pythons can grow to 24 feet,
Parisi said. Both snakes can live up to 50 years in captivity.
   Parisi said it's possible the pythons may be offspring of snakes
that either escaped or were turned loose by the now-defunct Tarpon
Springs Zoo, which closed more than two decades ago. Development may
be forcing the snakes out of woodlands, he speculated.
   All of the snakes have been taken to the Wildlife Rescue
facility. If they are not claimed within 10 days, they can be
donated to schools, zoos or other educational facilities, said
Vernon Yates, director of the center. Five of the snakes already
have been donated to other institutions, he said.
   ``I don't think there's too many people in this world we have to
tell to stay away from them,'' said Sheriff's Office spokesman John
Bocchichio.

<HEAD>Text of Gorbachev's Comments at Airport Farewell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of the comments of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, as spoken by his translator, at John F. Kennedy
International Airport prior to his departure for the Soviet Union on
Thursday:
   ``I would like to say that I have to cut short this visit and to
return to the Soviet Union because late last night, it was reported
to me that the earthquake that struck the Transcaucasian Republics
of the Soviet Union and particularly Armenia was extremely severe
and had extremely grave consequences, devastation and grave loss of
life. I urgently have to return to the Soviet Union.
   ``At present, a government commission is already at work, headed
by the prime minister of the Soviet Union. It is already in the
disaster area. Urgent measures are being taken to help all those
affected by this terrible tragedy, and I have to be there in this
effort.
   ``This morning, I had telephone conversations with President
Reagan and Vice President Bush. Both of them expressed profound
condolences on behalf of the American people to those affected and
to the government and people of the Soviet Union. I thanked them for
the expression of those feelings, and let me say here again on
behalf of myself, of the Soviet people and on behalf of those to
whom those feelings of sympathy were expressed by the president and
the vice president, let me extend our deep gratitud and our profound
appreciation.
   ``The president and the vice president conveyed their willingness
to extend assistance and appropriate help in this situation. I would
like to thank them, and I would like to thank the American people
for those feelings and for their readiness to give assistance in
this difficult hour.
   ``It has so happened that we had only one working day here in New
York. But I and my delegation believe that this was a very important
day. We were able to set out our views at the United Nations on the
world today and on the prospects of the world's development. We did
that at the United Nations, an organization which we value very
highly, and whose role we believe will grow in the development of
new international relations.
   ``We also were able to have another of the useful exchanges at
the United Nations, to talk to representatives of many countries,
and we feel that they understand what we said at the United Nations.
   ``Yesterday, I had the meeting with President Reagan and Vice
President, the president-elect, George Bush, and members of the
current and future U.S. administrations. We and the American side
share the view that this was a very important meeting which has
confirmed the high level of Soviet-American relations, which makes
it possible to discuss very important questions affecting relations
between our countries and problems of improving international
relations.
   ``This was a good meeting held in a very good atmosphere, an open
and trusting atmosphere. We believe that it was characterized by a
readiness to understand the positions of each other. And yesterday,
when I was asked to describe in one word the essence and the main
motive of that meeting, I said that word was continuity.
   ``So that meeting yesterday, and the telephone conversations that
we had today when we also briefly addressed our future cooperation,
make us confident, make the Soviet Union and the United States
confident, that our relations will expand and improve on the basis
of cooperation, on the basis of mutual respect for each other's
interests, and also taking into account responsibilities for our
nations and for the world.
   ``I think I would remiss in my duty if I went home without saying
how much we are grateful to New Yorkers for the hospitality and
feelings of friendship that they have been expressing over these
days. So to all New Yorkers, our very warm gratitude. We value that
very much. We believe that this may have been one of the most
important things that happened on this day of our stay in America.
That shows increased and increasing respect and friendliness and
willingness to cooperate on the part of the Soviet people and the
American people.
   ``The road ahead will be tough but we will go ahead, and we will
_ I believe _ be building on what has been achieved if we act as we
have been acting, and also maybe add something new. I think that
would open up good prospects for our two peoples and will be
extremely important for the world as well.
   ``Goodbye and thank you.''

<HEAD>States Vary On Health-Promotion Measures, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virginians and Californians are among the most
exercise-concious Americans, and residents of Missouri and Maryland
among those most likely to be overweight, a study of 21 states shows.
   Florida topped an overall ranking of how much people do to
promote their health, in the results released Thursday.
   New York topped the list of four metropolitan areas surveyed for
overall health promotion, followed by Los Angeles, Philadelphia and
Chicago.
   The rankings are based on surveys commissioned by Prevention
Magazine and carried out by pollsters Louis Harris and Associates
Inc., from 1983 through 1987. They are based on average scores for
the five years and do not account for changes within the period,
researchers said.
   Only the 21 most populous states were analyzed because at least
100 people in each state answered the survey questions, the report
said. The states cover 78 percent of the nation's population, the
study said.
   The percentage of residents who exercised strenuously at least
three times a week ranged from 42 percent in Virginia and 39 percent
in California to a low of 25 percent in New York state.
   Sixty-five percent of Missourians and 63 percent of Maryland
residents were reported to be overweight, with a low of 48 percent
among Californians.
   For overall health promotion, each state and metro area was
ranked by the extent to which residents followed health-promoting
behavior from a list of 21 practices. The scores were weighted to
emphasize practices with the most health impact.
   Items included on the list, called a ``Prevention Index,'' were
not smoking, wearing a seat belt, following healthy dietary
practices, avoiding driving after drinking, getting frequent
exercise and an annual blood pressure test, and taking steps to
control stress.
   The New York metropolitan area scored 1.01 above the national
average for the index, with New York City as a subcategory ranking
even higher at 1.17. The other areas in order were Los Angeles,
Philadelphia and Chicago. Chicago scored 1.13 percent below average.
   Florida scored 1.67 percent above the national average, while
Minnesota ranked last with 2.90 percent below average.
   The other states, in descending order from second place, were
Virginia, Massachusetts, New York, California, Washington state,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Texas, New Jersey, Maryland,
Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri, Louisiana, Tennessee, Ohio,
Indiana and Wisconsin.

<TEXT>
   More than 4,000 students and striking
technical school teachers on Thursday began a week of protests
across Greece with a march to press for increased government
spending on education.
   ``Nothing, nothing, will stop us now!'' the demonstrators shouted
outside the offices of Education Minister George Papandreou, son of
socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou.
   ``We have no professors, books, laboratories or lecture halls .
.. simply because government spending on education is so low,'' said
Costas Vassiliou, a technical school student.
   The younger Papandreou refused to meet with the student leaders,
ministry officials said.
   The protest was the first of several slated to take place before
the government's 1989 budget is debated in Parliament Dec. 15.
   Education spending, 8.2 percent of total government outlay, will
rise by less than 1 percent next year, according to the proposed
budget.
   Inflation is running at 14 percent.
   Students and teachers claim a 15-percent increase is needed to
end chronic shortages of technical equipment, books and teaching
staff.
   ``The increase neither keeps abreast of inflation nor takes into
account our soaring tertiary-school trained population,'' said
Stelios Klimopoulos, who heads the Union of Technical School
Educators.
   Earlier this year, George Papandreou promised wide-ranging
reforms in education and pledged his father's government would raise
the education allocation to 15 percent of the national budget.
   Greece's 17 state-run universities and technical colleges shut
down on Wednesday as professors staged a 24-hour walk-out to back
their demands.
   Educators said they planned to repeat the strike next week unless
the government pledges a major increase in education spending.
   The educators said they want a 50-percent salary hike and funds
for updating books and expanding graduate research programs. A
university lecturer with six years' experience currently earns $785
monthly.
   ``Because of our teaching duties, we're obliged to give short
shrift to research and because of lack of funds we don't have the
equipment to conduct it,'' said a lecturer at Athens' prestigious
Polytechnic Univeristy.
   The absence of graduate research opportunites is evidenced by the
large number of students who flock to Western universities to
continue their studies.
   More than 20,000 Greek students are working in graduate programs
in the United States and the European Economic Community, according
to Education Ministry officials.

   Wolfgang Guenther ran into the
street to search for his daughters after his neighborhood was set
afire Thursday by the crash of a U.S. warplane.
   He finally saw them coming from the direction of the downed U.S.
Air Force A-10, which left a scene of burned out buildings and cars.
   ``I was so very happy to see them alive, expecially after they
told me they saw the plane crash,'' Guenther said.
   ``They told me the plane came in low over their high school and
they could even see the pilot in the plane,'' said the 43-year-old
father, who lives about a half-mile from the crash site and went
outside after he heard an explosion.
   ``The plane rammed into a building that was right in front of
them. They're home now and they are in shock. They ran away to
escape,'' he said, his voice trembling.
   The high school in the Hasten district of Remscheid where
Guenther's daughters attend is less than a mile away from the crash
site. It was not damaged.
   Guenther said his daughters told him they saw a huge ball of fire
when the plane smashed into the building in front of them.
   Police and firefighters warned residents to close their windows
in case poisonous gas escaped because of the crash.
   Christine Czerwien, 36, said military planes often fly over the
area.
   ``In the summertime it's horrible, it seems like hundreds of
them. In the winter it's not normally so bad,'' Ms. Czerwien said.
   ``I've really been frightened by all these planes that have been
flying over our heads every day. I kept thinking what I would do if
my kids were missing after a thing like this.''
   Her two sons, aged 9 and 11, were not hurt.

   Investigators have ruled out a Coca-Cola
bottling plant as the source of a deadly pesticide found in soft
drink bottles at the home of a central Florida family, authorities
said.
   Officials are searching for the source of the chemical, thallium
sulfate, that poisoned four family members, leaving one in critical
condition.
   Traces of thallium sulfate, an insecticide and rat poison banned
from general use in 1965, were found Dec. 1 in four empty Coca-Cola
bottles at the home of Peggy Carr, 41, her son Duane Dubberly, 16,
and her stepson Travis Carr, 16, said Polk County sheriff's Capt.
Ray Church.
   Mrs. Carr is in critical condition and the teen-agers also remain
hospitalized. Mrs. Carr's husband, Parearlyn, absorbed traces of the
chemical but did not become ill, officials said.
   Investigators from the FBI, Food and Drug Administration and the
Polk County sheriff's office inspected the Tampa Coca-Cola Bottling
Co. plant on Wednesday.
   ``We're reasonably confident tht there's no problem in the
manufacturing or distribution process,'' said William Grigg, an FDA
spokesman in Washington.
   ``If tampering occurred, it happened after the bottles were
filled and capped,'' said sheriff's spokesman Steve Hulsey.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher learned from a
radio news bulletin Thursday that Mikhail S. Gorbachev wasn't coming
to visit her, and she promptly called the station to say she
understood.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev has got to go home, anything else would be
unthinkable,'' Mrs. Thatcher said of the Soviet president's decision
to cancel his visit to London because of the earthquake in Armenia.
   Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, sent a message
to Gorbachev expressing ``our heartfelt sympathy to you and all
those affected by this tragedy.''
   ``Naturally, I am sorry that we shall not be able to welcome you
to London next week,'' the message said. ``We look forward to doing
so soon.''
   Gorbachev had planned to have lunch with the British monarch at
Buckingham Palace and hold talks with Mrs. Thatcher during the Dec.
12-14 visit. His itinerary included laying a wreath at the tomb of
the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey and visiting St. Paul's
Cathedral and a factory.
   In a chatty call from her 10 Downing St. residence to the BBC's
early morning news program, ``Today,'' Mrs. Thatcher said she'd
heard the news on the program.
   ``It was the first indication we've had'' of the canceled visit,
she said.
   ``Then I heard later that you (the BBC) didn't know whether I'd
heard so I thought I'd better let you know I had ... that I heard
through your program,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher sounded unconcerned no one had informed her
officially.
   ``His people would expect it (his return) and he is just the sort
of person who would do it,'' Mrs. Thatcher said of Gorbachev, with
whom she has a good rapport. He has visited Britain twice and she
visited Moscow last year.
   Later Thursday, Soviet Ambassador Leonid Zamyatin met with Mrs.
Thatcher and gave her a message from Gorbachev apologizing for
canceling the trip.
   In a letter of reply, Mrs. Thatcher congratulated Gorbachev on
his announcement of big conventional arms cuts Wednesday, expressed
sympathy about the earthquake and invited him to Britain whenever he
can come.
   ``It holds out new hope _ and makes it all the more important
that we should meet soon to discuss the way ahead,'' Mrs. Thatcher
wrote of Gorbachev's proposal.
   In the letter, released to reporters by her office, she also told
Gorbachev: ``I entirely understand ... your place must be at home at
a time of such tragedy, and I know you would feel this very
strongly.''
   Emerging from Downing Street with the ambassador, she said
Gorbachev's speech reflected a ``whole new philosophy of treating it
all now as one world.''
   The prime minister cut off a reporter who suggested to the
ambassador that Gorbachev was returning home abruptly because of
political dissent.
   ``We're having none of that,'' said Mrs. Thatcher, standing
alongside the ambassador. ``This is a tragedy, it's a great tragedy
... this is a time for all to come together.''

   Afghan guerrillas and their Pakistani
backers reacted coolly Thursday to Soviet Presdient Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's proposals for a cease-fire and arms cut in Afghanistan.
   ``A cease-fire in the presence of invading forces is meaningless
in Afghanistan,'' said Abdul Rahim, spokesman of the powerful
Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla group.
   Pakistan's official news agency quoted the country's U.S.
ambassador, S. Shah Nawaz, as saying Gorbachev's speech Wednesday to
the United Nations was ``statesman-like'' but that his Afghan
proposals were unrealistic.
   The agency also reported that an Afghan pilot landed his MiG-21
jet in Pakistan on Thursday and surrendered. A government official
speaking on condition of anonymity said the plane landed at Miram
Shah in North West Frontier Province, 10 miles from the Afghan
border.
   The agency identified the pilot only as Capt. Asadullah.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported a clash between
the Afghan army and the insurgents, saying at least 86 guerrillas
were killed and 56 wounded. The report, which could not be
confirmed, did not give a date for the clash.
   There was no immediate response from Foreign Minister Sahabzada
Yaqub Khan on Gorbachev's proposals. However, a ministry official
who spoke on condition of anonymity said an end of hostilities was
``not practical'' because Afghan guerrillas were determined to fight
to victory.
   Gorbachev proposed a Jan. 1 cease-fire between Soviet-backed
Afghan forces and the U.S.- and Pakistan-supported guerrillas, with
both sides holding their ground.
   He called for a mutual arms freeze on the same date and for an
international conference to restore peace in the war-torn country.
   Moscow agreed in a U.N.-mediated accord last spring to withdraw
its troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15, 1989. Half of the troops
pulled out under the schedule, but the Soviet Union suspended the
withdrawal last month but pledged to remove its troops on schedule.
   Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 and stayed on to help
defend the Marxist government against an increasingly ferocious
insurgency.
   ``There is no demarcated line of battle where the cease-fire
could be enforced,'' Nawaz was quoted as saying by the agency
Associated Press of Pakistan.
   He said Gorbachev's proposal for an international conference on
Afghanistan was not new, and was ``aimed at giving legitimacy to the
Kabul regime,'' which seized power in 1978.
   The guerrillas have gained large parts of eastern Afghanistan
since the Soviet pullout began May 15. Communist government forces
still control most major cities while insurgents rule the
countryside.
   Rahim, whose party leader Burhanuddin Rabbani currently chairs
the seven-party guerrilla alliance, said the guerrillas would keep
fighting until all Soviets have left the country and the Kabul
government falls.

   President Reagan prepared Thursday for his
first news conference in six months, likely his last formal meeting
with reporters as the clock runs out on his eight-year presidency.
   One day after his fifth meeting with Kremlin leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, Reagan was ready to deal with questions about the
evolution of his views about the Soviet Union, from calling it an
``evil empire'' to signing the first superpower treaty ever to
abolish an entire class of nuclear weapons.
   Reagan said his summit with Gorbachev in New York, along with
President-elect Bush, had been a ``very useful meeting for both
sides.'' The Soviet leader capped his trip by announcing a
unilateral cutback of 500,000 Soviet forces, a reduction of about 10
percent.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater did not rule out the
possibility of another news conference before Reagan leaves office
on Jan. 20. However, first lady Nancy Reagan told reporters earlier
this week, ``Be nice. It's his last one.''
   Reagan, before going to the Oval Office on Thursday, placed a
farewell telephone call to Gorbachev, who abruptly cut short a New
York visit and flew home because of a devastating earthquake that
killed thousands of people in Soviet Armenia.
   As related by Fitzwater, the president expressed Americans'
``deep personal sorrow '' and asked Gorbachev if there is any way
the United States could help. Gorbachev later publicly expressed
gratitude for the U.S. offer.
   Reagan told Gorbachev he fully understood ``that you have no
choice but to return to your own country and be with your people
following the early morning earthquake. I know I speak for all
Americans when I express my deep personal sorrow at the loss of life
caused by this earthquake.''
   ``We understand that it was a very serious one,'' the president
said, according to Fitzwater. ``If there is any way we can be of
assistance, either bilaterally or through the international
community, please let me know.''
   ``I want to tell you again how much both the vice president and I
enjoyed meeting with you yesterday,'' Reagan said. ``I think it was
a very useful meeting for both sides. I wish you much success in the
future and a safe journey home. Godspeed.''
   Mrs. Reagan also spoke with Raisa Gorbachev on the telephone,
expressing sorrow over the quake and saying that she and the
president hope to see the Gorbachevs again either in California or
the Soviet Union.
   The Reagans will move to Los Angeles when he leaves office.
   In nearly eight years in office, the president has had relatively
few news conferences _ only 45 full-scale meetings with the press,
four of them this year.
   Two of this year's news conferences were held out of the country,
one at the conclusion of his summit with Gorbachev in Moscow on June
1 and another 20 days later in Toronto at the end of the
seven-nation economic summit.

   President-elect George Bush called Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev today to express sympathy for the
``horrible disaster situation'' caused by a devastating earthquake
in Armenia.
   ``Nobody really knows the numbers of people killed, but I had an
opportunity to tell him how strongly Barbara and I feel in human
terms about that loss,'' Bush said.
   Gorbachev, who held a summit luncheon in New York Wednesday with
Bush and President Reagan, cut short his visit to return home to the
Soviet Union to deal with the earthquake in Armenia.
   Bush said he told Gorbachev that he enjoyed the meeting, but the
two only discussed ``broad themes'' in their ``very pleasant''
15-minute conversation conducted with the use of simultaneous
translators.
   While Bush says he wants to build on the Reagan administration's
recent record of improved relations, he has refused to make any
foreign policy initiatives until he has his national security team
in place.
   Bush said the two discussed ``the toll in human life in this
horrible disaster situation.'' Though Bush didn't specifically offer
U.S. aid to quake victims, he said the ``American people will want
to hold out their hands to those families who lost loved ones.''
   Reagan telephoned Gorbachev to offer American assistance.
   Gorbachev remarked that the death toll was so high in part
because the quake occurred in the middle of the day when people were
out and around, according to Bush. There have been preliminary
estimates reported of up to 50,000 people killed in the quake.
   Bush, whose voice is hoarse because he has a cold, made his
comments on the earthquake at a picture-taking session to unveil the
inaugural license plate. He attached the red, white and blue plate
with the number 1 on it to his black limousine.
   The personalized, commemorative license plates cost $50, and can
be used on public roads until March 31, 1989, if registered through
The American Bicentennial Presidential Inaugural.
   In his address to the U.N. General Assembly Wednesday, Gorbachev
said that he looked forward to working with Bush _ as he had with
Reagan.
   As the three leaders parted in New York, Bush told Gorbachev, ``I
enjoyed the meeting. Hope to see you soon.''
   During a brief exchange with reporters on his return to Andrews
Air Force Base in suburban Maryland, Bush, suffering from a cold,
said he told Gorbachev that ``we hadn't put together our full team''
and that ``I'm in the process of doing that.''
   Bush named longtime associate James A. Baker as secretary of
state the day after his election Nov. 8, and he has named former
Ford administration national security adviser Brent Scowcroft to
serve in the same capacity. But the vice president hasn't yet
settled on a secretary of defense, although there have been
persistent reports the job will go to former Sen. John Tower,
R-Texas.
   Bush said that in his talks with Gorbachev, ``I also made clear
that we needed some time, and he understood that. He didn't have any
problem with that at all.''
   Bush called the luncheon ``a good, productive meeting,'' and said
he saw several positive aspects to Gorbachev's speech to the General
Assembly. The Soviet leader, among other things, announced that he
was reducing Soviet ground force troop strength by 500,000 from the
current level of roughly 5.6 million.
   ``There was no pressing on substantive details'' at the session,
Bush said, although he said weighty issues were discussed.
   ``And now I've got to go back and get our full national security
team together and set our strategy and establish our priorities,''
he said. ``As I said in the campaign, have our secretary of state
touch base with the allies, make contact and have a lot of contact
with (Soviet Foreign) minister (Eduard A.) Shevardnadze. ...
   ``And then, down the line, at an appropriate line, a meeting
between me and General Secretary Gorbachev can be discussed,'' the
vice president said. ``But there's no pressure on that. The main
thing is to formulate our plan to move them forward, so we have
progress. That's what I want.''
   Secretary of State George Shultz, briefing reporters on the
roughly two-hour luncheon summit, said there were ``general
references to the desirability of having the level of contact _ the
intensity of contacts at all levels _ maintained.''
   But Shultz said ``there's no immediate plan for any meeting that
came out of the session, as I saw it ... although obviously there
will be one at some appropriate moment.''
   Bush said in advance of the summit that he was going there in his
role as vice president, and that he would mostly listen.
   This stance produced one of the lighter moments during a
picture-taking session as Reagan, Gorbachev and Bush and several
aides sat at a long rectangular table.
   When Bush was asked to give his reaction to Gorbachev's troop
cutback announcement, he replied that ``I support what the president
says.''
   As people broke up in laughter, Gorbachev said, through his
interpreter, ``One of the best answers of the year.''

   The Swiss Red Cross has shut down
operations in south Lebanon and ordered the rest of its foreign
workers out of the area after one of them was abducted last month, a
spokeswoman said Thursday.
   The two offices in the coastal towns of Sidon and Tyre, which
extended humanitarian services to the entire region, have been
closed, said Francoise Derron, a spokeswoman for the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
   ``All our expatriates in south Lebanon have been pulled out,''
the she said. ``But we continue to work normally in the rest of the
country,'' she added.
   Since the Nov. 17 abduction of Swiss worker Peter Winkler, Red
Cross spokesmen in Beirut and Geneva have insisted the all-Swiss
organization does not plan to halt all its operations in Lebanon.
   The Swiss government has urged its nationals not to travel to
Lebanon.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said Lebanese drivers evacuated nine of the Red Cross'
12 vehicles in Tyre on Tuesday.
   Three Swiss nationals working in Tyre, Christophe Girod, 38,
Laurent Shophere, 35, and Philip de Korod, 36, drove the remaining
three Peugeot cars to Beirut on Wednesday, said the spokesman.
   The police spokesman said a Swiss Red Cross employee left Lebanon
on Wednesday aboard a Zurich-bound Middle East Airlines jet. He
refused to identify the employee.
   That brought to nine the number of Swiss personnel who have left
Lebanon since the Winkler's abduction. Twenty-two other delegates
remain.
   After the abduction, the Red Cross said it was closing down only
in Sidon, where Winkler was abducted.
   Winkler, 32, said in a handwritten note released by his captors
Friday that he was abducted because he was a Swiss citizen. The Red
Cross confirmed the authenticity of the handwriting.
   No group has claimed responsibility for his abduction.
   Fourteen other foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing
and believed kidnapped in Lebanon. The longest-held hostage is
American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   The State Department urged the government of
Paraguay on Thursday to halt the ``authoritarian and arbitrary''
practice of detaining opposition leaders and to permit a peaceful
march on Saturday to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
   Phyllis Oakley, a department spokeswoman, said more than a dozen
opposition leaders have been jailed without formal charges in
Asuncion, the capital of the South American nation.
   ``The Department of State deplores the Paraguayan government's
authoritarian and arbitrary practice of detaining opposition
figures, usually for several days at a time without arrest warrants
or formal charges,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   ``We understand that the Paraguayan government is apparently
trying to prevent a march planned for Saturday by a number of
political, human rights and labor organizations to commemorate the
40th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights,'' she said.
   ``We hope that both the government of Paraguay and the marchers
will honor the peaceful nature of the occasion,'' she said. ``A
peaceful march in Asuncion on Saturday would be a fitting
contribution by the Paraguayan people and the government to the
international celebration commemorating the U.N. human rights
declaration.''
   The declaration declares that all human beings are entitled to
basic rights. Article 9 of the declaration states: ``No one shall be
subjected to arbitary arrest, detention or exile.''

   An earthquake virtually destroyed several cities
and killed thousands of people in Armenia, officials said today.
Military surgeons and tons of medical supplies were rushed to the
stricken region.
   Armenian journalists said a Politburo commission led by Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov was receiving preliminary estimates that up to
50,000 people died in the quake which struck the southern region on
Wednesday.
   Soviet officials reported thousands of people were killed but
provided no detailed casualty count.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said he had
no information to back up the 50,000 figure. He said no official
toll had been released.
   In London, George Kurkjian, a representative of the Patriarch of
the Armenian Apostolic Church of South Armenia, quoted church
sources in Moscow as saying the death toll could reach 100,000.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cut short his visit to the United
States to return to direct rescue efforts. Before leaving New York,
he said President Reagan and President-elect George Bush offered
condolences to those affected.
   Soviet officials set up a ``helicopter bridge'' to take victims
from the mountainous republic of 3.3 million people to neighboring
Soviet Georgia. Official Soviet media said the earthquake wiped out
villages and destroyed half of Kirovakan, a city of 170,000 people.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass also reported destruction in
Georgia and the Azerbaijan republic in the northern Caucasus. Tent
cities for evacuees were set up throughout northwestern Armenia,
which was hardest hit.
   Military surgeons ``are carrying out a series of difficult
operations, including on children, in field conditions,'' army Gen.
Vladimir Arkhipov told Tass. The agency said a Red Cross plane
brought relief supplies, including 20,000 blood transfusion kits, to
Armenia.
   The earthquake, which struck at midmorning, wiped out Spitak, a
town of 16,000 about 55 miles northwest of the Armenian capital of
Yerevan, the government newspaper Izvestia said.
   It said just one of the town's eight schools remained standing.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake measured 6.9 on the
Richter scale.
   State television showed film of crumbled buildings in Spitak and
Kirovakan, Armenia's third-largest city. In one shot, a man put his
hands over his head in grief as he stood in the rubble of a
collapsed building.
   ``Practically all apartment buildings of nine floors or higher
are destroyed,'' the official newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
``There is significant damage in five-story apartment buildings.
Only individual one-story and two-three story homes of old
construction remain whole.''
   Komsomolskaya Pravda reported from Leninakan, a city of 250,000
about 30 miles from the epicenter, that preliminary reports
indicated ``tens of thousands of people became victims of the
earthquake.''
   Tass reported that 2,300 people were hospitalized in Yerevan from
Leninakan, Kirovakan and Spitak, and more were expected.
   Nora Milikyan, an editor of the official Armenian news agency
Armenpress, said in a telephone interview from Yerevan that ``the
worst place was Spitak.''
   ``The entire town was destroyed _ the hospitals and the schools
and the factories. All the houses were destroyed. There is nothing
left there,'' she said.
   Asked for the telephone number of the police station in Spitak,
deputy duty officer Lyova Oganisyan at the Interior Ministry in
Armenia said it wouldn't do any good because the station was
destroyed.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in New
York: ``A small village has practically disappeared from the face of
the earth.'' He did not identify it or elaborate.
   Gerasimov later dismissed speculation that Gorbachev was cutting
short his visit to the United States in order to deal with political
problems at home following Wednesday's sudden resignation of army
chief Sergei Akhromeyev.
   ``There is national tragedy there (in Armenia), and our leader
must be there where people suffer. This is the only reason (for the
return),'' he told CBS-TV's ``This Morning.''
   Gorbachev's appearance in Armenia could improve central
government ties with the restive region, which has been torn by
violent ethnic strife between Armenians, who are mostly Christian,
and predominantly Moslem Azerbaijanis.
   The population of Armenia has risen markedly in recent weeks as
settlers flee the ethnic violence, Izvestia said. About 180,000
refugees reportedly have fled across the border between the two
republics the last three weeks. Foreign reporters had not been
allowed into the region because of the unrest.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said today that soldiers pulled the bodies
of more than 50 children from a school that collapsed in Leninakan,
which is near the Soviet-Turkish border. Several children were found
alive.
   At least four deaths from the collapse of 50 houses were reported
Wednesday in eastern Turkey by that country's state press.
   A quake of 6.9 on the Richter scale is capable of causing
widespread damage. The scale is a measure of ground motion as
recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a
tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an
earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.

   Top members of the House Veterans Affairs
Committee have joined a lobbying effort aimed at winning the
appointment of Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark., as the first
veterans affairs secretary.
   Reps. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., the committee chairman, and
Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., supported the appointment in a letter
to President-elect Bush. The letter was also signed by
representatives of seven veterans organizations.
   The Department of Veterans Affairs was created last month when
President Reagan signed legislation elevating the Veterans
Administration to the 14th Cabinet agency. The new department will
come into being next March.
   Hammerschmidt, 66, was easily elected last month to his 12th
House term. He was a pilot in World War II and owned a lumber
company before entering Congress. He is a member of the Veterans
Affairs Committee.
   Hammerschmidt did not return telephone calls Thursday seeking
comment on the letter, but he has said he is not actively seeking
the job.
   The letter to Bush said Hammerschmidt ``is held in high esteem by
all members of Congress, both House and Senate, and he is highly
regarded by the national veterans service organization. He is a man
of the highest character and integrity and would serve America and
its veterans well.''
   Hammerschmidt is one of three men who have been prominently
mentioned to head the new department. The others are Everett
Alvarez, a former Vietnam prisoner of war who worked on Bush's staff
and has been deputy VA administrator; and former Sen. Jeremiah
Denton, an Alabama Republican who was also a Vietnam POW.

<HEAD>Former Astronaut Gives Soviet Leader Moon Flag</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The last gift presented to Mikhail S. Gorbachev
during his visit to New York was a Soviet flag that went to the moon
in 1971 with the Apollo 15 mission.
   The flag was handed to Gorbachev by former astronaut James B.
Irwin just before the Soviet leader climbed the steps to his plane
at Kennedy Airport on Thursday.
   Irwin said he and his crewmates in the July 1971 moon flight,
David R. Scott and Alfred Worden, had signed the flag, which was one
of a number of flags carried by the moonwalkers.
   ``We carried it for you and for the people of the Soviet Union.
And we visited the moon in peace for all mankind,'' Irwin told
Gorbachev.
   He also gave Gorbachev a coffee-table book, ``The Home Planet,''
which contains photos from space and text by American and Soviet
space travelers.
   ``I think you'll find it inspirational reading material for your
flight back home,'' Irwin said.
   Gorbachev shook his hand and tapped him on the shoulder.
   Irwin said he had tried to give the flag to Gorbachev during a
two-week visit last month to the Soviet Union but it could not be
arranged. He was invited, however, to present the flag at a
reception Gorbachev planned for Thursday night. When Gorbachev cut
his visit short, the Soviets let Irwin make the presentation at the
airport.
   Irwin left the space program in 1972 and founded the High Flight
Foundation of Colorado Springs, Colo., a nonprofit Christian group.
He also has mounted expeditions in search of artifacts that would
confirm biblical lore.
   He has made a half-dozen trips to Turkey in search of Noah's Ark
and earlier this year went to Egypt to try to find the chariots
swallowed when the parted waters of the Red Sea closed on the
soldiers of the pharaoh who were pursuing Moses and the Jewish
people.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's offer to cut the Red Army
by 10 percent and withdraw 50,000 Soviet troops from Eastern Europe
has not fully eased Western worries about a decisive Kremlin edge in
men, tanks and artillery.
   Gorbachev's unilateral cuts and message of peace were likely to
further enhance his soaring popularity in Western Europe, and to
rekindle calls in Congress and NATO member states for withdrawal of
some of the 335,000 U.S. troops in Europe.
   But Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other foreign
ministers of the Atlantic alliance quickly said Gorbachev's
statements confirmed their view that the Soviets have enough
non-nuclear armaments to mount a blitzkrieg offensive and tip the
balance in opening days of an East-West conflict.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in a statement issued
after Gorbachev's U.N. speech on Wednesday, said ``the Soviet Union
itself possesses more tanks and artillery than all the other members
of the Warsaw Pact and the (NATO) Alliance combined. And they are
concentrated in a manner which raises grave concerns about the
strategy which they are intended to support.''
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said Gorbachev's move
``seems to be a step in the right direction,'' but warned big
imbalances would remain.
   Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez welcomed
Gorbachev's proposals, but said, ``The Soviets know that in
conventional arms negotiations they have to reduce much more than
Western allies.''
   West German Defense Minister Rupert Scholz said Gorbachev must
follow up with ``actual and verifiable withdrawal of troops and
reduction of forces.''
   NATO, which cannot afford to match the Soviets soldier for
soldier and tank for tank, has a policy of deterring a conventional
attack with the threat of nuclear weapons, an approach that wags
have summarized as ``fight like the devil for two weeks, then blow
up the world.''
   The NATO nuclear deterrent and the perceived will to use it has
faded, however, with the signing last December of a U.S.-Soviet
treaty to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons and
continuing negotiations to sharply reduce long-range strategic arms.
   The Soviets have been tinkering with their doctrine, as well,
declaring that they will maintain forces adequate only to fend off
an attack, not to launch one.
   Gorbachev's announcement of troop cuts in Eastern Europe and an
overall reduction of 500,000 men in an armed forces totaling 5.6
million soldiers are the first concrete examples of the new Kremlin
policy, the doctrine of ``reasonable sufficiency.''
   Gorbachev also said the Red Army would shed 10,000 tanks, but
those cuts are only small steps in bringing NATO and Warsaw Pact
forces into balance, according to Western figures.
   NATO says the Warsaw Pact has the following advantages:
   _Ground forces in Europe: Warsaw Pact 3.1 million, NATO 2.2
million.
   _Tanks: Warsaw Pact, 51,500; NATO 16,424.
   _Armored fighting vehicles: Warsaw Pact 22,400; NATO 4,135.
   _Other armored vehicles: Warsaw Pact 71,000, NATO 35,351.
   _Combat aircraft: Warsaw Pact 8,250, NATO 3,977.
   _Helicopters: Warsaw Pact, 3,700, NATO 2,419.
   _Artillery: Warsaw Pact 43,400, NATO 14,458.
   _Anti-aircraft systems: Warsaw Pact 24,400, NATO 10,309.
   _Armored vehicle launched bridges: Warsaw Pact, 2,550, NATO, 454.
   NATO, in its statement, proposed a limit of 40,000 tanks for
either side, which Gorbachev's cuts would approach.
   The Soviet Union, he said, would remove six tank divisions from
Eastern Europe, out of a total of 15 tank divisions counted by the
London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.
   Such a step could help ease NATO concerns about the offensive
potential of the Red Army.
   But the Soviet president offered no specifics about easing the
imbalance in other types of weapons. Moreover, pulling 50,000 Soviet
troops out of Eastern Europe would not come close to balancing
ground forces.
   According to the IISS annual report, the Soviet Union has 380,000
troops stationed in East Germany, 65,000 in Hungary, 80,000 in
Czechoslovakia and 40,000 in Poland.
   Gorbachev said Red Army forces would be withdrawn from East
Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, but he did not provide a
breakdown.
   So far, the Soviet Union has not disclosed its troop and armament
levels, and those numbers will be at the center of debate when the
two sides sit down to discuss conventional force cuts, a step that
U.S. officials say will probably come early next year.
   Despite the continued imbalance, President Reagan,
President-elect Bush and Shultz welcomed the Soviet step, which is
part of a wider opening of the Soviet Union toward the West.
   Before even agreeing to resume conventional force negotiations,
which had been under way for 15 years in a different format, the
West demanded improvement in Soviet human rights policies,
improvements that have been reflected in greater numbers of Jews and
Armenians allowed to emigrate, cessation of Soviet jamming of
Western radio broadcasts and the release of many prisoners of
conscience from prisons and camps.

<HEAD>Overweight Firefighter Offered Settlement In Weight Bias Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATH, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former firefighter who says he was fired
because he was too chubby has been offered a settlement in his
discrimination complaint.
   Supervisor Richard Brook would not divulge the settlement
approved this week by the board of Bath, in central Michigan, but he
said Clarence Edward Christy would not be reinstated and that the
amount was less than had been requested.
   ``I guess the board feels we did the best we could for the
community under the circumstances that were there,'' Brooks said.
   Christy claimed he was discriminated against when he was fired in
1985 on the grounds that his weight kept him from doing the job
properly. The 5-foot-6-inch former smoker weighed 260 pounds when he
was fired.
   Christy was seeking reinstatement, back pay totaling $4,000 and
$6,000 for emotional and mental stress.
   Although Christy had not seen the settlement, he said Wednesday
that he would accept it.
   ``They've been messing around with this for three years and
there's been a lot of heat toward me from the township. I think I
just better take what they offer and let the matter die down,'' he
said.
   Officials in the township 15 miles northeast of Lansing contended
that physical exams showed Christy's breathing ability was below
normal, raising the possibility that other firefighters might have
to carry him out of a fire.
   The state Civil Rights Department charged the township in July
with unlawfully discriminating against Christy due to weight and
handicap.

   Six-year-old Prince William is learning to ski on
the slope where Britain's Olympic loser, Eddie ``the Eagle''
Edwards, made his first faltering leap to fame, the manager of the
ski center said Thursday.
   William has taken three lessons on the dry ski slope at the
Gloucester Ski Center near Highgrove, his family's country home west
of London, said Dave Watson.
   William is second in line to the British throne behind his
father, Prince Charles.
   Charles and his wife, Princess Diana, are accomplished skiiers,
and Diana recently disclosed her older son ``loves skiing.''
   Edwards soared to fame in the Winter Olympics by finishing last
in two ski jumping events. Fans fell in love with his thick glasses,
jutting chin and unflappable humor.

   Actor Gary Busey, recovering from head
injuries suffered in a motorcycle crash, was out of intensive-care
unit as his condition continued to improve.
   Busey, 44, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his
starring role in ``The Buddy Holly Story'' in 1978, hit his head on
a curb after being thrown from his Harley Davidson motorcycle
Sunday. He underwent 90 minutes of brain surgery after the crash.
   Busey, a Malibu resident, was moved to a regular hospital room
from the intensive-care unit Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, where he remained in serious condition, spokesman Ron Wise
said.
   ``He's really far along for somebody who had his kind of brain
surgery only three days ago,'' Wise said.
   The actor was expected to make a complete recovery, Wise said
earlier.
   Busey, who wasn't wearing a helmet during the crash, has
campaigned against efforts to pass a California law requiring all
motorcycle riders and passengers to wear helmets.
   Lt. Ellis Smith said a helmet probably would have protected Busey
from head injury, adding, ``I don't think even the helmet would have
been broken.''

   Prince Harry came to the rescue Thursday when a shy
co-star forgot her lines in their kindergarten Nativity play.
   The 4-year-old son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana was
playing a shepherd and had just uttered his lines ``in a very
confident voice'' when a classmate playing another shepherd forgot
hers, said a Buckingham Palace spokesman who was in the audience.
   The prince stepped closer, whispered the forgotten lines into her
ear, and the show went on, said the spokesman, speaking anonymously
in keeping with British custom.
   Charles, heir to the British throne, and his wife, Diana, were in
the audience for their son's first speaking role. Harry played a

   Matilda Cuomo, wife of Gov. Mario Cuomo, is
in a court fight over her father's will.
   Mrs. Cuomo and two of her siblings are battling their mother and
two other brothers over where the will of Charles Raffa will be
probated and who should be the executor of the $13.7 million estate.
   A Nassau County Surrogate Court judge set Jan. 5 for a hearing.
He also ordered on Wednesday that the temporary executor, Sam Raffa,
one of the three sons, not dispose of any property.
   Raffa claims he was named executor in a will codicil made in 1984
shortly after his father was severely beaten during a mugging.
Charles Raffa never recovered and died Oct. 19, 1988.
   Sam Raffa also wants the will probated in Nassau County. His
mother, Mary, and brother, Frank, have sided with him.
   Matilda Cuomo, along with her sister Nancy Mazzola and brother,
Joseph, want to use an executor named in a 1977 will. They want the
will validated in Brooklyn, where they said their father lived most
of his life.
   ``This is not a split in the family,'' Mrs. Mazzola said. ``We're
just trying to make some decisions.''
   But Sam Raffa said in a court affidavit that trying to remove him
as executor was ``part of a plan to eventually attack the provisions
of my father's will.''

<HEAD>Early Departure Elicits Sympathy, Sorrow and Savings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sudden departure of Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
eliminating a full day of Big Apple sightseeing, produced sympathy,
sorrow and savings _ and some sighs of relief Thursday from those
who missed out on the historic visit.
   ``The mood is very sad,'' said Elaine Fink, principal of the
Manhattan elementary school that had been scheduled to play host to
Raisa Gorbachev in the afternoon. ``The children are very down that
a terrible tragedy killed thousands of people, and that Mrs.
Gorbachev will not get to see a school in the United States.''
   Her feelings were reflected at each planned stop by the
Gorbachevs on their final day in Manhattan. The Soviet leader left
New York a day early to rush home because of a massive earthquake
that devastated Soviet Armenia.
   In addition to the trip to P.S. 6 on the Upper East Side,
Gorbachev and his wife had planned a short walk through Central Park
before a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and had scheduled a
morning stop at the Javits Convention Center for a Soviet trade show.
   ``I guess I'll just go do some Christmas shopping and go home,''
said John Chrystal, chief operating officer of Bankers Trust Co. of
Des Moines, Iowa, who had been invited by Gorbachev to attend the
trade event.
   Chrystal's uncle, Roswell Garst, owned the Iowa farm that Nikita
Khrushchev visited in one of the high points of his 1959 American
tour, and the Iowan had come to New York solely to see Gorbachev.
   He was not alone in feeling let down.
   ``Yes, we are disappointed, but who can argue with an
earthquake?'' asked a resigned Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, who
was to be Gorbachev's host in the park. ``We hope he can come back
another time.''
   At the Metropolitan Museum of Art _ the final tourist attraction
on the Gorbachev tour _ the mood was somber, said John Ross, head of
public relations.
   ``I think the only thing we can say is to express sympathy for
the earthquake victims,'' said Ross. ``The leader of the Soviet
Union is not someone who comes by every day, and if he comes back,
we would be pleased if he came to see the museum.''
   While Stern said little was done to prepare Central Park for the
visit (``We cleaned up a bit, but we do that every day''), Ms. Fink
said the students and teachers at P.S. 6 had a crash course on the
Soviet Union to prepare for Mrs. Gorbachev.
   ``The kids were ready, the excitement was at an incredible
level,'' she said. ``Now it's a tremendous sadness over the tragedy.
... It's a lesson in disappointment for us all.''
   While there was sympathy and sorrow, there were also savings for
the New York City police. Officials were busy computing how much of
the $1 million in overtime set aside for the trip would be saved by
eliminating a day's work.
   The sighs of relief came from the Transportation Department,
which battled the ``Gorbylock'' that paralyzed midtown Manhattan on
Wednesday evening as Gorbachev's motorcade wound through town.
   ``We're doing better now,'' said Joe O'Brien, a spokesman for the
department. ``To a large degree, we don't have to worry about
traffic today. There's just the regular traffic to worry about.''
   Also left in the lurch by the change in plans was billionaire
developer Donald Trump, whose invitation to have Gorbachev visit the
opulent Trump Tower was rejected. Trump was among a group scheduled
for dinner Thursday night at the Soviet Mission; instead, the
closest he came to the Soviet leader was a glimpse of a Gorby
look-alike on Tuesday.
   Trump, unsurprisingly, was undaunted.
   ``Donald said he's going to see him anyway next year in the
Soviet Union,'' said Trump spokesman Dan Klores.

   President Reagan expressed Americans' ``deep
personal sorrow '' at the devastating earthquake in the Soviet Union
today and asked Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to let him
know if the United States could help.
   In a telephone call to Gorbachev from the second-floor living
quarters of the White House, Reagan also told the Soviet leader he
believes their meeting Wednesday on Governors Island in New York was
``very useful ... for both sides.''
   Nancy Reagan also spoke with Raisa Gorbachev on the telephone,
expressing sorrow over the quake and saying that she and the
president hope to see the Gorbachevs again either in California or
the Soviet Union.
   In an airport statement before his departure from New York,
Gorbachev said he also received a telephone call from
President-elect George Bush offering condolences and help.
   Speaking through an interpreter, the Soviet president said, ``On
behalf of the myself, of the Soviet people and on behalf of those to
whom those feelings were expressed by the president and the vice
president let me extend our deep gratitude and our profound
appreciation.
   ``The president and the vice president conveyed their willingness
to extend assistance and apppropriate help in this situation and I
would like to thank them and I would like to thank the American
people for those feelings and for their readiness to give assistance
in this difficult hour.''
   Reagan, when asked later whether he expected the United States to
provide assistance, replied, ``They haven't asked for any yet.''
   He spoke briefly with reporters after signing a proclamation
observing the 40th anniversary of the United Nations Declaration of
Human Rights.
   In remarks at the signing ceremony the president noted that human
rights was among the subjects he discussed with Gorbachev on
Governors Island. He said the United States is ``not yet satisfied''
with the Soviet human rights record but also said progress was being
made.
   ``We want to see the release of all political prisoners,'' Reagan
said. ``Dozens remain in prison.''
   He said the United States also seeks changes in Soviet laws used
against dissidents and that he was told during his meeting with
Gorbachev that ``some progress is being made'' in this regard.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
relayed the Reagans' end of the earlier conversation with the
Gorbachevs.
   ``I received word last night of your early departure from New
York and wanted to tell you how sorry I am that you must leave,''
the president told Gorbachev.
   ``I fully understand, however, that you have no choice but to
return to your own country and be with your people following the
early morning earthquake. I know I speak for all Americans when I
express my deep personal sorrow at the loss of life caused by this
earthquake.''
   ``We understand that it was a very serious one,'' Reagan said.
``If there is any way we can be of assistance, either bilaterally or
through the international community, please let me know.''
   ``I want to tell you again how much both the vice president and I
enjoyed meeting with you yesterday,'' he said. ``I think it was a
very useful meeting for both sides. I wish you much success in the
future and a safe journey home. Godspeed.''
   Gorbachev was cutting short his trip and returning to the Soviet
Union today because of worsening reports of damage and deaths from a
massavie earthquake in the Transcaucasus that devastated areas of
northern Soviet Armenia and eastern Turkey on Wednesday.
   Speaking to the conservative scholars of the American Enterprise
Institute upon returning from Wednesday's meeting on Governors
Island in New York Harbor, Reagan said he found his talks with the
Soviet president ``positive and encouraging.''
   Still, he said, ``fundamental differences between our countries
remain in many areas.''
   Referring specifically to Gorbachev's pledge to reduce Soviet
conventional forces, he said the United States must exercise caution
as East-West dealings enter ``this critical junction.''
   ``We came to Washington together in 1981, both as anti-communists
and as unapologetic defenders of a strong and vibrant America,''
Reagan told members of the conservative think tank.
   ``I am proud to say I am still an anti-communist,'' he said to
applause. ``And I continue to be dedicated to the idea that we must
trumpet our beliefs and advance our American ideals to all the
peoples of the world until the towers of the tyrants crumble to
dust.''
   ``Freedom works, and freedom is on the march, and yes, I am an
optimist, and yes, I believe I have every reason to be.''
   At the end of their private session, before they joined aides for
lunch, Reagan gave Gorbachev an inscribed photograph of the two of
them walking in the woods during their first summit meeting in
Geneva in 1985.
   ``We have walked a long way together to clear a path for peace,''
he wrote over his signature.
   The two men met again in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1986, in
Washington in 1987 and in Moscow in 1988. Wednesday's session, with
President-elect George Bush along in his role as vice president, was
arranged to coincide with Gorbachev's visit to the United Nations.

   NATO urged Moscow Thursday to go beyond
the ``positive contribution'' of a unilateral cutback of 50,000
troops in Eastern Europe by negotiating a lower ceiling of Soviet
forces on foreign soil.
   Taking a cue from U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who
briefed the 15 NATO foreign ministers on Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
initiative, the allies declined to match the Soviet president's move
with a voluntary reduction of their own.
   Instead, NATO said it will propose to the nine-nation Warsaw Pact
limits on the forces each country in each alliance can deploy. Talks
on cutting the forces are expected early next year.
   ``No country should be able to dominate the continent by force of
arms,'' the NATO statement said.
   It suggested that no country should have more than a fixed figure
_ ``such as 30 percent'' _ of all forces in Europe and called for a
limit of about 12,000 tanks in any one country. The Soviets have
20,000 tanks in East Germany alone, NATO officials say.
   Gorbachev, speaking Wednesday at the United Nations in New York,
offered to cut forces over two years in East Germany, Czechoslovakia
and Hungary.
   The allies, instead of reciprocating, focused on the 2-1 manpower
edge and 3-1 tank advantage they say the Soviets hold over NATO.
   ``The Soviet Union itself possesses more tanks and artillery than
all the other members of the Warsaw Pact and the (NATO) alliance
combined,'' the statement said.
   ``We hope that the new thinking in the Soviet Union will open the
way for mutual agreement on realistic, militarily significant and
verifiable arrangements which enhance security at lower levels,'' it
said.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said, ``We are
proposing a dramatic change in the military situation in Europe,
directed to very substantial reductions by about 50 percent to a
balanced outcome.''
   He said NATO's aim was ``to concentrate on the key offensive
systems which are tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers.''
   The United States, which has about 335,000 troops in Western
Europe, also would be affected by the proposed limits.
   ``Roughly speaking, NATO is talking about cuts that would leave
us around 95 percent of current levels, and how that would be broken
down among the relevant nations has not been figured out yet,'' said
a senior U.S. official who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity.
   The start of a new series of conventional arms talks between the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact has been
delayed by wrangling over human rights at a 35-nation conference in
Vienna.
   But steps taken by Gorbachev to release political prisoners and
permit U.S. psychiatrists next month to examine Soviet mental
institutions have raised expectations the Conventional Stability
Talks can begin early next year.
   ``We are trying to get done as soon as possible,'' a U.S.
official said.
   The NATO declaration, which took two years to prepare, was
revised at the last moment to refer to the reductions Gorbachev
announced Wednesday.
   ``It doesn't change the basic concept we've been working on,'' a
senior U.S. official said.
   For years, the Western allies have complained there is an
``asymmetry'' in favor of the Warsaw Pact by virtue of its
commanding edge in tanks, artillery and combat aircraft.
   And yet, ``everybody agrees that there is a change occurring in
the Soviet Union, that there is something different'' under
Gorbachev, said the official who briefed the reporters under
condition of anonymity.
   In another development, an internal NATO dispute with France
apparently was resolved. The French, who participate only in some
NATO decisions, wanted 12 non-aligned European countries to be able
to join in reviewing the decisions taken by the 16 NATO allies and
the seven Warsaw Pact members.
   But the U.S. official said an agreement was worked out last
weekend that the review could be held in 1992, provided the NATO
nations have ``operational automony'' in the negotiations.

<HEAD>Reagans to Get Annual Post-Cancer Surgery Checkups</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds last 5 grafs with background</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, will go
to Bethesda Naval Hospital on Friday for their annual post-cancer
surgery checkups, the White House announced today.
   ``Both the president and the first lady have remained completely
asymtomatic, with no clinical suggestion of recurrence,''
presidential physician John Hutton said in a statement issued by the
White House.
   The president, who underwent surgery for colon cancer in July
1985, will undergo a colonoscopy, a chest X-ray, a CAT scan, a
cardiac stress test and a pulmonary function evaluation, Hutton said.
   Mrs. Reagan, who had her left breast removed in October 1987,
will have her second mammogram since undergoing the modified radical
mastectomy, Hutton said.
   Following the exams, the couple will go to Camp David, Md., for
the weekend, the statement said.
   In Reagan's initial surgery, doctors removed a two-inch cancerous
polyp and nearly two feet of his colon as well as the surrounding
tissue.
   Since 1985 and up until last January, Reagan had a colonoscopy
every six months to check for any recurrence of cancer. Each time,
doctors found polyps _ or small, fleshy growths _ and removed them.
They were all found to be non-cancerous.
   No polyps were found in his last such examination in January of
this year. Reagan did not have such a checkup this summer.
   The colonoscopy is an examination of the large intestine with a
long, flexible instrument that uses fiber optic technology to allow
doctors to see inside the bowel.
   The CAT scan is a computerized three-dimensional X-ray of the
internal organs.

<TEXT>
   A liberal organization that concerns itself
with the First Amendment said Thursday that the Reagan
administration turned a cold shoulder ``to the fundamental liberties
guaranteed by our founders.''
   It said President-elect Bush is showing more sensitivity toward
constitutional guarantees of freedom of spech and freedom of the
press, and separation of church and state.
   People for the American Way, which describes itself as ``the
non-partisan constitutional liberties organization,'' issued a
report that it says shows 241 cases in which the administration
trampled on freedom of speech and freedom of the press, separation
of church and state and other rights guaranteed by the Constitition.
   The group cited a $45,000 federal grant to Pat Robertson's
Christian Broadcasting Network; a White House aide's saying that
anyone directly around Ronald Reagan ``gets saved or gets out''; a
40 percent increase in classified information; the news blackout on
the U.S. invasion of Grenada; and the attempt to induce reporters
for two newspapers not to report various intelligence activities.
   ``The incidents we've cited in our report demonstrate ... a slow,
steady, quiet usurpation of First Amendment rights,'' Arthur J.
Kropp, president of the organization, told a news conference.
   ``It isn't as if Ed Meese and Ronald Reagan sat down (eight years
ago) and said to themselves `How can we sink free speech today?'''
Kropp said.
   ``But the Reagan administration did come to town with a very
specific political agenda ... and, most important, a seeming
willingness to do whatever it takes to effect their agenda. If that
meant violating the principles or rights set forth in the First
Amendment, then, apparently, they were willing to do just that.''
   John H. Buchanan, chairman of the group, said that while Bush is
part of that record, he is encouraged that the president-to-be is
``selecting people of reason, not radicalism, for his
administration.''
   Buchanan said Bush ``should not repay whatever debts he owes the
far right by selecting ideologues for the middle- and lower-level
positions in his administration,'' and that he should choose as
judges ``men and women of unquestioned legal ability and competence.
   ``I am heartened that, after eight years of an administraion that
avoided, manipulated and even attacked the news media, the
president-elect is being accessible and open to the press,''
Buchanan said.
   ``We urge the new president to adopt more reasonable policies on
the classification of government documents; to eliminate the
reclassification of documents that are currently available to the
people; and to prohibit restrictions on unclassified information.''

   Fifty high-school journalists will gather next
year to cover a simulated news event in Washington as the final
deadline challenge in a national writing competition offering a full
college scholarship as the prize, the sponsor announced Thursday.
   Each of the 27,000 high schools in the country will be invited to
participate in the first stage of the contest, established by Pilot
Pen of Trumbull, Conn.
   ``We have developed the Pilot Pen scholarship to inspire and
reward high school students interested in a career in journalism,''
said Ronald Shaw, president of the writing instrument company.
   The final stage of the contest will come in October 1989, when
one winner from each state will come to Washington to spend the day
coverning ``events'' at the National Press Club related to
international developments. Included in the events will be news
conferences, news releases and other briefings.
   The students will be interrupted as they write their news stories
with more updates and news conferences. At 5 p.m., the stories will
be due. Judging will take place that evening, with the winner
announced at a banquet.
   In addition to the four-year college scholarship for the winner,
the four runners-up will receive $2,500 each.
   Each high school in the nation will be notified by mail in
January how to apply to enter the contest. The first 5,000 schools
to respond will be included in the contest.
   Students will complete a writing assignment in April at their
school. Each school's winner will be forwarded to the contest
administrator, who will decide on a winner for each state to attend
the national competition.

   They did the hanging for famous ``Hanging Judge'' Isaac Parker of
Fort Smith, Ark., after rounding up bank and train robbers hiding in
the brush of Indian Territory, smashed whiskey stills during
Prohibition and protected slaves freed after the Civil War.
   The nation's oldest law enforcement organization, the Marshals
began their bicentennial celebration Thursday with the opening of an
exhibit at the Supreme Court followed by a black-tie dinner at a
nearby hotel.
   Organized by the Marshals Service with the help of the
Smithsonian Insitution, the exhibit displays artifacts from
massacres and shootouts that have earned the men their place in the
lore of the Wild West and their immortalization by movie legends
John Wayne and Henry Fonda.
   ``As the United States expanded across the continent, U.S.
Marshals and their deputies established the federal goverment's
authority over areas that had known little order and no goverment.
Most of them were rough, uncouth men,'' according to an excerpt of
the Marshals' official history by Frederick S. Calhoun.
   The brothers of Deputy Frank Dalton, one of many men killed in
Indian Territory, were also deputies before they turned to robbing
banks.
   ``They were the federal goverment at the local level,'' Calhoun
said. ``There was no infrastructure of a bureaucracy, so when the
citizens got mad they took it out on the federal marshals.''
   As a result, as many as 100 marshals and their deputies died in
Indian Territory between 1872 and 1896, their deadliest era, Calhoun
said.
   ``With the exception of Indian Territory, the far most dangerous
time to be a marshal was in the South after the Civil War,'' Calhoun
said. ``If the Ku Klux Klan didn't get you, the moonshiners did.''
   At least 400 and as many as 700 marshals have died in the line of
duty, more than any other law enforcement agency. But the exact
number isn't known because of difficulties in determining whether
members of posses had actually been deputized before their deaths,
said Marshals Service director Stanley Morris.
   ``At almost every point in history when the federal government
was involved in a significant event, there were marshals
participating,'' said Marshals Service spokesman Stephen Boyle.
   A marshal who fired the gun that sent settlers scrambling for a
homestead in the Oklahoma land run of 1889 at Guthrie; marshals
guarded the first black student at the University of
Mississippi-Oxford in the 1960s; and marshals ringed the Pentagon
during the Vietnam war protests of the early 1970s.
   They arrested gangster Al Capone twice and took the census until
1880.
   As evidence of those events, the Marshals' exhibit contains the
arrest warrant for Geronimo, an 1870 Ku Klux Klan robe and hood from
a recruit in the Klan's birthpace of Pulaski, Tenn., a 1790 whiskey
still from the Whiskey Rebellion era, and one of the two machine
guns from the St. Valentine's Day massacre in Chicago _ the
bloodiest of Prohibition.
   The exhibit, which will tour a dozen cities over the next 2{
years, also includes a Jesse James vest and sidearm, and original
drawings by Wyatt Earp of four gunfights, including one at the OK
Corral involving the legendary wild West marshal.
   Appointed by the president, the 94 district U.S. marshals are a
part of the executive branch, created by the first Congress in the
Judiciary Act of 1789 _ the same law that established the Supreme
Court and the federal judicial system.
   The marshals of the 1980s provide security in federal court and
protect Supreme Court justices when they travel beyond Washington.
They operate the witness protection program that gives new
identities to those whose lives are jeopardized by testifying for
the government, and track down federal fugitives.
   They also take custody of those accused of federal crimes and
transport federal prisoners, running the government's only scheduled
airline service with two Boeing 727s and smaller aircraft out of
their Oklahoma City hub, Morris said.
   They are responsible for property seized in the war on drugs and
other federal crimes and have managed horse ranches, restaurants,
condominums, a golf course and a greenhouse.
   With just 3,000 employees, the service is smaller than the New
York City Police Department, Morris said, yet its ranks are
stationed in every U.S. judicial district from Guam to the Virgin
Islands.

<HEAD>Contest Opened To Design Women's Military Memorial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Sponsors of a proposed memorial honoring women
who served in the nation's armed forces said Thursday they would
hold a contest to select the best design.
   The competition, which begins immediately, is similar to the
contest that produced the design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial,
one of the most visited sites in Washington.
   The memorial has been authorized by Congress and is to be built
on a three acre site at the entrance to Arlington National Cemetery,
just across the Potomac River from Washington.
   Sally Byington, spokeswoman for the Women in Military Service for
America Memorial Foundation Inc., said the design must incorporate
an existing neo-classical monument, the Hemicycle, at the cemetery's
entrance. The memorial is to include a visitors center, an
auditorium and a computer registry of women who served in the U.S.
military, she said.
   The group, which already has received federal approval for use of
the site, estimates the memorial will cost $15 million to $20
million. It is seeking contributions for the project.
   The competition is open to any American citizen 18 years or
older. The winner will be decided by a panel of judges headed by
Jaan Holt, director of the Washington-Alexandria Center of Virginia
Tech's college of architecture and urban studies.
   Holt said the judges will select three designs and award their
designers $10,000 to further develop their plans. One winning design
will be selected and become the basis for the memorial.
   Those wishing to enter should send a $50 non-refundable
registration fee to Carla I. Corbin, Women in Military Service
Memorial, Department 560, Washington, D.C. 20042-0560. Checks or
money orders should be made payable to WIMSAF Design Competition.
Byington said the deadline for entries is May 15, 1989.

<HEAD>Inaugural Committee Borrowing $20 Million-Plus for Festivities</HEAD>

   The Presidential Inaugural Committee said
Thursday it is halfway to its goal of borrowing more than $20
million to pay for a bicentennial inauguration week crammed with
free public events as well as fancy galas.
   ``We've made every effort to be cost-conscious ... and make sure
what we do is self-sustaining,'' said executive director Stephen
Studdert.
   He and other officials said all the money, in the form of
interest-free loans of at least $100,000, will be repaid when
proceeds from ball tickets and other sales become available.
   Committee co-chairman Bobby Holt said the budget for inauguration
week activities will be between $20 million and $25 million and
added, ``We need the money up front.'' Finance director Walter Ganzi
Jr. said ``we're about halfway there'' when asked about fund-raising
progress.
   The schedule of events released Thursday includes six free ones,
including a pageant, a parade, a children's inaugural festival, a
prayer service at the Washington Cathedral and a White House welcome
on Jan. 21, George Bush's first day in his new residence.
   Other events range from the $30-a-ticket Young American Ball to
the $1,500-a-person Inaugural Dinner. Tickets to the eight other
official balls the night of Jan. 20 will go for $175 apiece.
   Holt and the other co-chairman, Penne Percy Korth, said the Jan.
18-22 inaugural schedule, with its special events for children and
the public, reflects the Bush family's wishes that the celebration
be as open and inclusive as possible.
   ``We're going to try to have more free events than at any
inauguration before,'' Holt said. He said there is a contingency
plan for bad weather included in the budget.
   A bipartisan congressional committee is in charge of the
inaugural ceremony and a luncheon that follows it, events expected
to cost the taxpayers about $2.5 million.
   The Presidential Inaugural Committee sponsors and pays for all of
the other activities, and will reimburse the government for
personnel used for anything other than their usual functions during
inaugural events.
   Holt said there are about 300 staff people on his committee and
5,000 volunteers helping them. By the inauguration, he said, the
staff could be as large as 700 and some 30,000 volunteers will be on
board.

<TEXT>
   Israelis on Thursday reacted with various
degrees of skepticism and coolness to the latest statements of
moderation from PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was quoted by aides as dismissing
Arafat's acceptance of Israel as part of a ``campaign of deceit.''
They said it was aimed at duping Western countries, particularly the
United States.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, head of the left-leaning Labor
Party, said on Israel's armed forces radio that ``the PLO has
learned ... to say one thing and do another.''
   Peres suggested there may be room for a dialogue if the PLO met
three conditions: recognition of Israel's right to live in peace, a
halt to terrorism inside and outside Israel, and unqualified
acceptance of U.N. resolutions that guarantee Israel's right to
exist in secure borders.
   The most welcoming comments came from leftists like Ran Cohen, a
Parliament member of the Citizens Rights Movement who urged the
government to ``bless the process and ask how we can advance it.''
   But answering Cohen in an Israel Radio debate, hawkish former
U.N. Ambassador Binyamin Netanyahu accused the PLO of ``using
declarations of peace as tactics of war.''
   Most Israelis did not see either the Palestine National Council
declaration in November or Arafat's elaboration in Sweden on
Wednesday as sincere or convincing recognition of Israel's
legitimacy.
   ``If ever a mountain gave birth to a mouse, that was it,'' said
the Jerusalem Post, a liberal English-language daily. ``The
ambiguities ... have been compounded, not removed.''
   Arafat's campaign of moderation has had an impact, however.
Repeated public statements of a willingness to talk peace and accept
Israel chip away at the skepticism and strengthen liberal arguments
that the Arabs genuinely seek peace.
   One sign of change is the recent endorsement of Israel-PLO talks
by the Peace Now movement, a grassroots anti-war organization that
led the campaign for Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon.
   Opinion polls have indicated the Israeli public is more flexible
than the politicians about negotiating with the PLO. A Tel Aviv
University survey of 1,180 Israeli adults conducted at the start of
the Palestinian uprising found more than half ready for talks if the
PLO changed its policies and recognized Israel.
   Israelis remain hard to convince.
   One reason is they have the precedent of the late Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat, who underlined his sincerity by coming to
Jerusalem to address Israel's parliament in November 1977. He melted
public doubts even though Israelis had voted a right-wing government
into office only months before.
   To many Israelis, Arafat's statements appeared directed more at
winning the recognition of the United States than at starting
negotiations with Israel.
   ``He cannot achieve his aims as long as he cannot convince the
Israeli public that he really wants peace,'' said one official who
demanded anonymity.
   ``He has real difficulty changing Israeli minds because they are
less impressed by his words abroad than by the acts of terror in
Israel.''
   Alon Liel, spokesman for Peres' Foreign Ministry said Arafat's
Stockholm comments were ``moderate but very much different from
other PLO leaders'' who showed no willingness to accept Israel.
   Hard-line Palestinian views appeared in graffiti on walls in the
occupied territories after Arafat's Stockholm statement, raising
questions about the degree to which Arafat controlled the PLO.
   ``No concessions, not even an inch of Palestine,'' said a leftist
slogan spray-painted on a wall in the West Bank town of Nablus.
   ``Yes to holy war against the enemy,'' declared a Moslem
fundamentalist slogan on a wall in Bethlehem.

   President Reagan offered help Thursday while
the American Red Cross sent money and launched a fund-raising effort
to aid residents of Armenia, the Soviet republic struck by an
earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people.
   ``If there is any way we can be of assistance, either bilaterally
or through the international community, please let me know,'' Reagan
told Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev, before leaving New York, expressed gratitude to the
American people for ``their readiness to give assistance in this
difficult hour.''
   ``We are prepared to assist directly or through international
organizations, and if the Soviets request assistance we'll work with
them to determine the kind of assistance most needed and in any way
that we might be helpful,'' State Department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley said.
   A few hours after making his telephone call to Gorbachev, Reagan
was asked whether he expected the United States to be providing
assistance for earthquake relief to the Soviets. ``They haven't
asked for any yet,'' he said.
   ``This is an incredible disaster, one that would tax the
resources of any society, including the Soviet Red Cross,'' said
Richard F. Schubert, president of the American Red Cross in
Washington.
   The International Red Cross in Geneva, Switzerland, is working
with Soviet officials to determine what supplies are most needed and
which countries can fill those needs, he said.
   The United States will be providing antibiotics and other
medicines, according to the American Red Cross, which has already
begin efforts to obtain supplies of those medicines.
   Schubert said Soviet officials have ``airlifted in about 15 tons
of blankets, tents, first aid kits. Armenia at this point in the
year is pretty cold, and so there is a critical need for emergency
shelter.''
   The Red Cross has activated a toll-free number for people to call
to offer assistance, reported spokeswoman Terry Gautier. The number
is 1-800-453-9000.
   Already the large Armenian community in Los Angeles has offered
its assistance, Schubert said.
   And Ms. Gautier said Armenian churches across the country have
begun efforts to help.
   ``All our energies, everybody in the Armenian community, is
dedicated, because of compassion, because of understanding, because
of concern for human needs to providing relief for those victims of
this natural tragedy,'' said George Keverian, speaker of the
Massachusetts House and a leader in the Armenian community in that
state.
   What other items the United States may be asked to supply, in
addition to medications, will be determined after Soviet authorities
have had time to assess the damage and determine their needs, Red
Cross officials said.
   ``We have agreed that just as soon as an assessment is made, we
will begin to supply their needs as we have the ability to do,''
Schubert said.
   In the meantime a $50,000 gift has been sent to allow local
officials to purchase needed goods, Ms. Gautier said.
   Schubert said Soviet officials are welcoming assistance, a
strikingly different situation from in 1986 when offers of help in
the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear accident were largely ignored.
   Red Cross officials said it is accepting donations, which should
be earmarked ``Soviet-Armenian Earthquake.''
   Donations can be mailed to local chapters or to the American Red
Cross, International Disaster Relief, P.O. Box 37243, Washington,
D.C., 20013. The Armenian Relief Society of North Armerica Inc.,
based in Watertown, Mass., is collecting donations of money and
clothing, medical supplies, tents, sleeping bags and clothing. The
Armenian Assembly of America, based in Washington, says an Armenian
Earthquake Relief Fund has been established, with monetary donations
to be sent to St. Vartan Armenian Cathedral in New York and the
Armenian General Benevolent Union in Saddle Brook, N.J.
   One thing not requested by the Soviets was blood. ``All blood
needs for the earthquake victims will be collected from internal
Soviet Union resources,'' Schubert said.
   The temblor that devastated much of Armenia leveled cities and
killed thousands of people. It caused Gorbachev to cut short a trip
that would have taken him on to Cuba and Britain.
   The 16,000-resident town of Spitak, near the epicenter of the
tremor, was reportedly wiped out. The government newspaper Izvestia
said just one of the town's eight schools still stood.

   A U.S. Air Force jet carrying
ammunition slammed into a residential area of this city today,
setting buildings and homes on fire. Officials said at least six
people were killed and dozens injured.
   Rescue officials said the death toll could rise. Authorities were
fighting flames as they tried to reach the scene of the crash.
   An Air Force commander said the Air Force suspended all tactical
training flights in Europe until next week.
   The A-10 Thunderbolt II jet, a plane designed to support ground
forces, was carrying 1,000 rounds of 30-mm training ammunition, said
U.S. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Ed Neunherz.
   He said the ammunition could explode on impact. Local officials
said there were several explosions after the crash and that they
believed the blasts were caused by the ammunition.
   A West German military spokesman, Gen. Botho Engelin, told
reporters at the scene that six bodies had been pulled out of the
wreckage, which was still smoking several hours after the crash.
   The Air Force confirmed that the A-10 pilot was killed and
identified him as 34-year-old Capt. Michael P. Foster.
   A statement sent by telex to the news media did not provide
Foster's home town in the United States. It said he was survived by
his wife and two sons.
   ``In light of this mishap, the U.S. Air Force in Europe has
suspended all tactical flying from now through next Tuesday in
memory of those who were killed or injured in the mishap today,''
Maj. Gen. Marcus A. Anderson, commander of the Third Air Force, told
reporters.
   The crash was likely to increase public opposition to low-level
military training flights over West Germany. That opposition grew in
August when Italian stunt planes collided and crashed into a crowd
of spectators at an air show at the U.S. Air Force Base in Ramstein,
killing 70 people.
   Since March 31, there have been 12 military air crashes in West
Germany.
   Police said in a statement that the number of known dead in
today's accident was five. The ARD and ZDF television networks also
reported that five bodies were pulled from the burning rubble in the
central West German city.
   Reinhard Fleichmann, a spokesman for Remscheid, said between 40
to 50 people were injured, many of them seriously.
   ``We haven't even reached the aircraft. It's still wedged into a
burning house,'' Fleischmann said.
   A witness, quoted on local radio station WDR said: ``A bright
orange fireball went up. The aircraft slammed into a house about 50
meters (55 yards) in front of me. Then there were explosions.''
   The witness, who was not identified by name, said flames engulfed
nearby houses and motor vehicles. The witness said he spotted the
pilot's parachute hanging from a tree about 30 yards away from the
scene.
   Hundreds of rescue workers rushed to the scene of panic and chaos
in Remscheid, located near Duesseldorf in the densely populated
industrial area.
   Doug Moore, spokesman at the U.S. Air Force headquarters in
Ramstein, said in a telephone interview that the jet was assigned to
the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing at the Royal Air Force base in
Bentwaters, England. But he said the one-man plane was temporarily
assigned to a base in West Germany for training.
   Ralf Berghaus, Remscheid police spokesman, told the AP that six
multifamily homes were in flames and ``body pieces are lying
around.'' He said, ``There were several ammunition explosions after
the crash.''
   A local radio station said there was fog in the area at the time
of the accident, which occurred at approximately 1:30 p.m. (7:30
a.m. EST).
   Remscheid, with a population of 130,000, 15 miles east of
Duesseldorf.
   Jane's Defense Weekly has said the NATO air forces, excluding
Turkey, lost 97 combat planes in the 12-month period to Oct. 31. The
U.S. Air Force lost 40 combat planes, including 20 F-16s, seven F-4s
and 5 A-7s, Jane's said.

   Members of Gov. Kay Orr's staff created
pandemonium at her proclamation signing on Thursday when they
presented her with 25 stuffed bears.
   Instead of exchanging names for Christmas presents this year, the
governor's staff bought stuffed panda bears for the Emergency
Medical Services' Medi-Tedi Ride-Along program, said press aide Doug
Parrott.
   Health Department spokeswoman Marla Agusutine said the program
aims to have a teddy bear in every ambulance and state patrol car in
Nebraska. That'll take 5,000 bears.
   ``The object is to have a friend at hand whenever a young child
has to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance or patrol car,''
Parrott said.
   Parrott said state agency heads have decided to give money to the
governor for the program instead of buying her gifts this year.

   Sixth-grader Anna-Rose Mathieson
expected better from her school cafeteria.
   She began a hot lunch boycott after the school cafeteria
advertised her favorite croissant sandwich but served ham and cheese
on a hamburger bun.
   Mathieson wrote the Palo Alto Unified School District.
   ``I am writing you in regards to the school lunches,'' she wrote.
``Today was supposed to be a croissant sandwich. That's my favorite
lunch, so I ordered it.
   ``It turned out to be a hamburger bun, with ham and cheese. Some

   ``This is the third or fourth time that has happened this year. I
really think it is most unfair. When they say croissant, they should
have croissant.
   ``I'm not going to have hot lunch anymore, unless they get
better.''
   She's been boycotting since Oct. 26, and had no plans to stop.
   Gerald Schmidt, principal of Juana Briones School, conceded
Wednesday that Mathieson knows the difference between a croissant
and a burger bun and promised the mix-up won't happen again.
   ``I really got fed up with them,'' said Mathieson. ``You never

   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Thursday it's bringing more lawsuits than ever.
   In the 1988 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the agency turned
over 372 civil cases to the Justice Department, compared with the
previous record of 342 civil cases in the 1986 fiscal year. There
were 59 criminal cases in fiscal 1988, compared with 41 in both 1986
and 1987.
   However, the agency's administrative orders totaled 3,085, down
slightly from 3,194 in the previous year. EPA said it tried not to
issue a large number of orders when new school asbestos regulations
took effect at the start of the year, but rather tried to make sure
school boards understood them.
   The agency said state environmental agencies referred 904 civil
cases to their attorneys general and issued 9,363 administrative
orders. Both figures were said to be records, but the old records
were not given.
   EPA said it now had 17 firms on a blacklist of companies barred
from contracts because of certain air or water pollution violations,
compared with three in January 1986, and had 450 judicial consent
decrees in effect, compared with 200 in 1984.
   Though the Justice Department is free to reject cases sent to it
by EPA, EPA spokeswoman Robin Woods said the department accepts
virtually all of them.

   Soldiers working desperately under spotlights in a
nighttime effort pulled a few survivors from the
earthquake-shattered School No. 9 in the town of Leninakan. Mostly,
though, they found only the dead.
   In Kirovakan and Spitak, two other northwestern Armenia towns hit
hard by Wednesday's devastating earthquake, there were more crumbled
buildings, and more casualties.
   Soviet TV showed Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov's visit to the
cities, where viturally every multistory building was damaged and
telephone communication was cut off from the outside world.
   The news showed a man in one unidentified city putting his hands
over his head in grief as he stood amid a collapsed building.
   Ryzhkov appealed to other republics to respond to the Armenian
tragedy and send cranes and other equipment needed to clear
flattened buildings and repair the ruptured rail lines and roads.
   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said soldiers worked into the
night at the school in Leninakan after the midmorning quake to save
the children. Two sergeants pulled the bodies of more than 50
children from the ruins, and only a few pupils were found alive.
   ``Only individual one-story and two-three story homes of old
construction remain whole,'' Komsomolskaya Pravda reported from
Leninakan, a town of more than 250,000 people.
   It said firefighters had managed to extinguish fires at an oil
storage facility, a tourist center, hotel and textile factory.
   Other bonfires throughout the city were man-made; set by crowds
of homeless who huddled together in the December night to keep warm.
   Spitak, population 16,000, was reported to be wiped out. It
leveled all but one of eight schools in the town, 55 miles northwest
of Yerevan and close to the earthquake's epicenter, according to the
newspaper Izvestia.
   Asked for the phone number of the police station in Spitak,
deputy duty officer Lyova Oganisyan at the Interior Ministry in
Armenia said it wouldn't do any good because the station was
destroyed.
   In Kirovakan, half of the buildings crumbled, the officials
Soviet news agency Tass said. About 190,000 people lived in the
city, but thousands moved to tent cities set up by the military.
   Blood donations were being collected throughout the Soviet Union
for quake victims. Tons of blankets, field kitchens, tents and
medicine were pouring into the region, the Tass news agency said.
   Soldiers were setting up tent cities for evacuees from devastated
regions, and restoring electricity and water supplies, Army Gen.
Vladimir Arkhipov told Tass.
   Volunteers stayed behind as thousands of evacuated. Families
scoured hospitals in the Armenian capital of Yerevan or tied up
telephone lines in a frantic search for word of loved ones.
   ``The hospitals are overflowing. People are really upset because
they don't know what has happened to their relatives,'' said Gennady
Simonyan, deputy director at the official Armenpress news service.

<HEAD>Controversy over Prominent Activists Jailed for Treason</HEAD>

   A judge Thursday sentenced three
black leaders of the country's biggest anti-apartheid group to what
he called lenient jail terms of 10 and 12 years for treason.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu joined other activists in
condemning as ``vicious,'' sentencing at the close of a
controversial three-year trial in which the nationwide coalition
United Democratic Front was declared a revolutionary organization.
   Tutu also accused the government of ``playing games'' by moving
jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela to a house on
a prison farm.
   ``Mr. Mandela is still a prisoner,'' said Tutu. ``Let the
government release him and all other political prisoners
unconditionally. Then they will see the enormous influence for good,
for peace and reconciliation that he will be.''
   Britain's Foreign Office echoed Tutu's call, saying this ``would
open the way for a genuine national dialogue in the context of the
suspension of violence on all sides.''
   U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins was among several diplomats at
Pretoria Supreme Court. In a statement, his embassy said the
sentences were ``not as harsh as they might have been'' but
regrettable because those convicted were ``men of good will working
peacefully for a non-racial democracy.''
   Patrick Lekota, 40, a spokesman for the front, was sentenced to
12 years; 10-year terms were given to its national secretary Popo
Molefe, 36, and Moses Chikane, 40, the Transvaal Province branch
secretary; church field worker Thomas Manthata, 48, was sentenced to
six years' jail, also for treason.
   Seven other defendants were convicted of terrorism. Six received
suspended sentences and were banned for two years from talking to
the press or participating in politics. The seventh is to serve five
years in jail.
   Supporters in the courtroom raised clenched fists then joined the
defendants in singing ``God Bless Africa,'' anthem of the
anti-apartheid movement.
   Judge Kees van Dijkhorst ruled that the United Democratic Front
collaborated with the outlawed African National Congress to incite
anti-government violence in 1984. Tutu and more than 900 other
supporters of the front were named as unindicted co-conspirators.
   ``It's a vicious sentence,'' said Tutu. ``I myself will certainly
be very, very involved in ensuring that I leave no stone unturned in
overturning that conviction and sentence.''
   Van Dijkhorst said the defendants could play a meaningful
political role in South Africa ``provided that by word and deed they
forswear the violent option.''
   ``I would rather err on the side of leniency'' said the judge,
because ``none have been found guilty of planning or executing
direct violence.''
   Treason and terrorism convictions can draw the death sentence.
   Defense lawyer George Bizos argued for suspended sentences,
noting most defendants had spent three years in prison.
   ``When men differ fundamentally to the government of the country,
the courts must be particularly careful that their punishment is not
so harsh against those who have seen fit to try to right things that
they think are wrong,'' he said.
   The sentencing came a day after the government transferred
Mandela from a clinic to a house at a prison farm in the scenic
wine-growing town of Paarl, northeast of Cape Town.
   It was the first time since 1962 that the 70-year-old prisoner
has lived outside a cell, except for hospital stays. Mandela has
just recovered from tuberculosis.
   ``Mr. Mandela is not confined to the house and has free use of a
wide range of facilities,'' the Prisons Service said Thursday.
``Visits by his immediate family will be unlimited.''
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, is expected to visit her husband over the
weekend. But lawyer Ismail Ayob said, ``She does not intend taking
more than the 40-minute (monthly) visits that she had been allowed
in the past until all political prisoners are given the same
privileges.''

<TEXT>
   Canada's Aviation Safety Board blamed iced wings
for the air disaster that killed 248 U.S. troops three years ago,
but a minority report concluded a fire possibly ignited by
explosions caused the crash.
   The review of the Dec. 12, 1985, crash at Gander, Newfoundland,
published Thursday, has been plagued by disputes and limited
evidence.
   Four of eight board members signed the minority report concluding
the cause was ``an in-flight fire that may have resulted from
detonations of undetermined origin.''
   Board Chairman Kenneth J. Thorneycroft broke a tie to vote with
the four other members for a report that found no evidence of
sabotage, a fire or explosion before impact of the Arrow Air charter
DC-8.
   Often-public board disputes during the inquiry have led
opposition politicians to call for a judicial review of the accident.
   Canada's worst air disaster killed all 256 aboard _ eight
American crew members and the soldiers heading home for Christmas to
Fort Campbell, Ky., from peacekeeping duties in the Middle East.
   The board report concludes the aircraft stalled at low altitude
100 seconds after takeoff and recovery was impossible.
   ``The most probable cause of the stall was determined to be ice
contamination on the leading edge and upper surface of the wing,''
it says. ``Other possible factors such as a loss of thrust from the
No. 4 engine and inappropriate takeoff reference speeds may have
compounded the effects of the contamination.''
   The minority opinion found ``ice contamination was not a factor
in this accident.'' While it did not conclude terrorism was
involved, it said security arrangements at the flight's point of
origin in Cairo, Egypt, ``were not ideal.''
   ``Fire broke out on board while the aircraft was in flight,
possibly due to a detonation in a cargo compartment,'' says the
minority opinion.
   The board's report concludes, ``the balance of evidence did not
support the occurrence of a preimpact fire or explosion either
accidental or as a result of sabotage.''
   Thorneycroft defended what he told reporters was a ``fair and
balanced'' report produced despite many difficultiesm including:
   _ Witnesses caught only a glimpse of the plane as it crashed in
limited early morning light.
   _ The voice recorder did not capture any conversations or sounds
in the cockpit and the recorder provided only limited information.
   _ There was little left of the plane.
   The board recommended a national safety campaign to ensure all
pilots are aware of the potential consequences of taking off with
even minor amounts of ice on the wing.
   Other suggestions were:
   _ Requiring all Canadian users of DC-8 aircraft to establish
detailed procedures for detecting ice before takeoff.
   _ A Transportation Department review of procedures to check
cockpit voice recorders and possibly similar action in the United
States.
   _ A change in U.S. federal aviation regulations on flight periods
and rest provisions for crews.
   The board's report found the crew's December flight schedule was
heavy enough to have high potential to produce fatigue. But the
minority opinion said ``members of the cockpit crew performed their
duties without apparent fault.''
   Thorneycroft, a former deputy commander of the North American
Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado Springs, Colo., said there was
``no pressure at all'' from American authorities to discount
sabotage as a possible cause.
   DC-8 manufacturer McDonnell Douglas took part in the
investigation as well as Pratt and Whitney, which made the engine,
the U.S. Army and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.

   The United Nations honored anti-apartheid
activists Nelson and Winnie Mandela on Thursday as it commemorated
the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
   ``The record of human rights in our age is besmirched by summary
executions and arbitrary arrests, `disappearances' and torture, the
killing of defenseless demonstrators, and detentions for reasons of
belief or conviction,'' Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
told the General Assembly.
   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted without
dissent by the General Assembly Dec. 10, 1948, is the basic U.N.
document under which members pledge to safeguard life and liberty
and abolish torture and slavery.
   All 159 U.N. member states profess their love for human rights.
But over 80 countries still have prisoners of conscience and torture
is practiced in more than 60 nations, according to Franca Sciuto,
chairwoman of the executive committee of Amnesty International.
   Ms. Sciuto and other officials of the London-based organization
which won the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize presented Perez de Cuellar with
a petition signed by more than 3 million people calling on all
governments ``to ratify the world's human rights treaties, to bring
their own laws and practices into line with them and to act to
protect human rights worldwide.''
   Only 43 governments, for example, have signed a protocol allowing
individuals to petition the United Nations with complaints of human
rights abuses, said Ms. Sciuto.
   Awards were presented to six human rights activists.
   Mandela, leader of the African National Congress guerrilla
organization fighting the South African government, has been serving
a life sentence since 1962 on a conviction of plotting sabotage
against the state.
   Winnie Mandela, his wife since 1958, has become a public symbol
of resistance to apartheid. She has been imprisoned several times,
sometimes in solitary confinement.
   The Mandelas received their awards in absentia, as did Murlidar
Devidas Amte of India, a lawyer and aide to Mohandas K. Gandhi who
went on to fight for rights for lepers, the blind, the ill and
disadvantaged children.
   A posthumous award went to Leonidas Proano of Ecuador, the Roman
Catholic bishop of Rio Bamba who worked to protect the rights of his
country's native people. He died in August.
   John Humphrey of Canada received his award in person. Humphrey
was director of the U.N. Division of Human Rights from 1946-66 and
helped prepare the first draft of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. He is founding president of Canada's section of Amnesty
International.
   Also present to accept the brass and wood plaque engraved with a
flame symbolizing human rights, was Adam Lopatka of Poland. Since
1983 he has chaired the U.N. commission drafting a Convention on the
Rights of the Child, which the world body plans to adopt next year.
He is now first president of Poland's Supreme Court.
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill insisted on recognition of human rights in the
U.N. Charter when World War II discussions laid the groundwork for
the United Nations.

   France has decided to drop its visa requirement for
visitors from seven European countries that are not members of the
European Economic Community, the Foreign Ministry announced Thursday.
   Government officials have said recently they may also rescind the
visa requirement for U.S. passport holders, but there has been no
announcement.
   Citizens of Austria, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Cyprus and
Malta will again be welcome in France without visas, as they were
before emergency measures put in place in September 1986 during a
wave of terrorist bombings in Paris.
   ``This decision was taken in recognition of the reinforcement of
cooperation in Europe on security and the fight against terrorism
and drug trafficking,'' said a Foreign Ministry spokesman.
   France began demanding visas from people carrying passports of
all nations except the 11 other members of the EEC, plus
Switzerland. The decision was contested by officials from other
European countries, especially Sweden and Austria.
   Other countries affected by the 1986 decision include Algeria,
Morocco, Tunisia and other African nations with traditionally close
ties to France. French officials have said they wanted to avoid any
appearance of a racial criterion, with predominantly white countries
being the only ones exempt from the visa requirement.

<HEAD>Federal Beef Over Grading Apparently Dooms Roasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If federal bureacrats have their way, 3{ tons of
edible roasted beef will be destroyed because it might be too chewy
to live up to the ``choice'' grade given by a meat processor.
   There are no provisions in U.S. Department of Agriculture rules
to let the meat go to a charity, even in the spirit of the holiday
season, according to government attorneys.
   In a civil lawsuit filed Tuesday under the name ``U.S. v. 7,007
Pounds of Cooked Roast Beef,'' the USDA seeks the forfeiture of the
504 roasts, prepared at Max Bauer Meat Packers, a wholesale
distributor supplying other South Florida distributors and markets.
   Inspectors examined the 15- to 18-pound roasts last summer and
found them marked USDA Choice when they actually should have been
left ungraded, the lawsuit says. Choice beef sells for 50 to 70
cents more per pound than ungraded beef.
   ``It's just a little more chewy,'' Larry Dyal, a Fort Lauderdale
meat distributor, said Wednesday. ``You'd have to be a gourmet to
tell the difference.''
   But the USDA inspectors found the difference in lab tests and
ordered the beef, some of which had been distributed, detained in
freezers.
   ``The only thing we know is that someone came in, inspected it
and put `Don't touch' on it,'' said Bill Quirch, with E & G Trading
Co. in Miami.
   Mike Pasano, attorney for Max Bauer, dismissed the federal beef
as ``a bunch of government nonsense.''
   ``We've asked for it back, politely,'' he said.
   Pasano said what his company would do with the meat if it was
returned depends on the beef's condition. ``Quite honestly, we have
concerns, and we've expressed them to the federal government, that
they've held onto it for such a long time.''
   He'll make a formal request for the beef in future filings with
U.S. District Judge Leonore Nesbitt.
   If the USDA prevails, there are no provisions in the law to let
the meat be donated to feed the hungry, said U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtenin.
   ``Some official will go out to the dump and watch it be buried,''
said Emil Thrasher, a deputy USDA director.
   But the prospect of destroying good food astounds Harry
Somerville, one of the Brothers of the Good Shepherd who operate
Camillus House, a downtown Miami mission for the homeless.
   ``Holy Hannah, yes!'' he said when asked if his organization
could put the beef to use, were it ever offered. ``You could feed a
lot of hungry people with that.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly 1,000 people gathered in
chilly, damp weather Thursday to mark the death of John Lennon, an
annual ritual once banned by the authorities but held this year
under official auspices.
   The peaceful gathering sponsored by the Communist Youth
Organization came two days before an independent rally on human
rights that will also take place with official permission.
   Thursday's gathering by the so-called ``Lennon Wall,'' which once
was covered with slogans extolling the slain Beatle and peace,
marked the founding of a new independent group, the John Lennon
Peace Club.
   A statement read to the crowd and applauded demanded the release
of four independent peace activists jailed in October.
   It declared the four honorary members of the new group, along
with Lennon himself and Jan Palach, the Czechoslovak student who
burned himself to death on Wenceslas Square in 1969 to protest the
1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Rock singer Vladimir Merta, one of several poets and singers to
perform for the crowd, welcomed news that some of the 80,000 Soviet
troops stationed in Czechoslovakia since 1968 will be withdrawn in
the next two years.
   A small police presence watched the crowd, but made no apparent
attempt to break up the gathering even when hundreds of people
lingered behind to sing Lennon songs and burn candles for peace.
   Saturday's rally, called by the Charter 77 human rights movement
and four other groups, was originally schedculed for Prague's
Wenceslas Square.
   Authorities banned the gathering there but for the first time in
nearly two decades agreed to let it go ahead at another site further
from the city center.
   Charter 77 activist Jan Urban said Thursday the independent
groups would have people on Wenceslas Square to redirect them to the
alternative site.

   Their top salesman was missing, but Soviet
entrepreneurs went ahead Thursday with the opening of an
unprecedented trade show intended to usher in a new era of
Soviet-American commerce.
   As fashion models showed off the latest trends from Moscow to the
beat of American pop music, Soviet executives showed off their
wares, including furs, tractors, vodka, books, toys, cars, guns and
caviar.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev had been scheduled to open the
trade fair, which is a showcase for his policy of perestroika, or
economic restructuring. But his appearance was scrubbed when he
decided to return to Moscow early because of a catastrophic
earthquake in Armenia.
   In his place, deputy premier Vladimir M. Kamentsev cut the ribbon
along with U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William Veity.
   Kamentsev hastily delivered a speech calling for the lowering of
trade barriers between the United States and the Soviet Union, then
rushed from the hall to catch a plane to Moscow.
   Verity, congratulating the Soviets for Gorbachev's
``electrifying'' United Nations speech on Wednesday, also hailed the
improvement in trade between the two nations.
   ``We believe this is an important step in building long-term,
mutually beneficial, non-strategic trade between the United States
and the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   The Soviets spent an estimated $2 million on the trade show at
the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center _ one measure of the
importance the Soviet Union places on increased trade with the
United States.
   ``You really only do this to someone you want to impress,'' said
David Wolstenholme, whose American marketing company spent more than
a year putting together the show, which runs through Dec. 20 and is
open to the public.
   The Soviets want to increase exports to the United States to
raise their reserves of hard currency, which they need to purchase
goods from the United States and other Western nations.
   But as Kamentsev suggested and the trade show reveals, U.S. trade
barriers make it extremely difficult for Soviet enterprises to sell
their goods in this country.
   For instance, Vil Rayevskiy, the salesman at a booth offering
Baikal hunting rifles, said the Soviets have had some success
selling the guns to European countries but not to the United States.
   ``The main problem and the main obstacle is your very high duty
for our consumer goods,'' he said.
   According to Rayevskiy, the United States imposes a 60 percent
duty on the guns, whereas gun manufacturers from some countries _
those with most-favored-nation status _ pay only 10 percent.
   ``How can we compete with them?'' he asked. ``Reduce our price to
zero?''
   Asked why he bothered to come to the show, Rayevskiy said, ``We
hope these goods will be interesting to American people and maybe
there will be some changes in this law.''
   Other Soviet enterprises have had more success. Smoky Harrison,
an American spokesman for Soviet-made Belarus tractors, said the
company has been doubling its sales annually since 1985 and expects
to sell more than 2,000 tractors in the United States this year.
   ``It's a basic tractor, a basic tool,'' Harrison said.
   Perestroika also has been profitable for U.S. companies that
operate in the Soviet Union. Perhaps the most successful has been
Pepsi-Cola, which signed a multimillion-dollar agreement Thursday to
expand its trade with the Soviet Union.
   Other Americans, such as Jim Hickman and Peter Buckle of Los
Angeles, have entered joint ventures with Soviet enterprises without
expecting large profits immediately.
   Hickman and Buckle are working with the Symbol Cooperative in
Moscow to market souvenir T-shirts and sweatshirts. Some examples at
the trade fair included a sweatshirt bearing the logo of Moscow
State University and one that says ``Summit '89'' in Russian and
``Gorbachev-Bush'' in English.
   The two said the Russian sweatshirts were not up to the quality
demanded by the U.S. market, and high tariffs made them too
expensive to sell profitably in this country.
   Still, Hickman said, ``the long-term Soviet market'' justifies
their investment.
   ``We're in on the cutting edge of perestroika, which gives one a
lot of opportunities as well as being an exciting time,'' added
Buckle.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's hurried return to his
earthquake-stricken nation avoids the specter of pictures of the
Soviet president on a lighthearted sightseeing tour while thousands
of his countrymen lay dead.
   ``I have to be there,'' he said Thursday as he left the United
States to fly directly home, bypassing scheduled visits to Cuba and
Great Britain.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze underlined the point,
saying, ``Despite the fact that all necessary measures are being
taken to overcome the extremely grave consequences of this disaster,
Mikhail Gorbachev believes that when the people are suffering, he
has to be there.''
   Gorbachev himself said the earthquake ``was extremely severe and
had extremely grave consequences, devastation and great loss of
life. So I urgently have to return.''
   Although such decisions are reached in secrecy, it was apparent
the remainder of Gorbachev's highly publicized New York stay,
including the opening of a Soviet trade show, a stroll through
Central Park and a museum tour, would have contrasted sharply with
the stark pictures of disaster at home.
   And Gorbachev, whose nationally televised chats with constituents
have set a new, modern style for a Soviet leader, could hardly
ignore the situation. To do so would have been reminiscent of
President Reagan's hesitation in 1983 to return to Washington from a
California vacation after the Soviet shootdown of a Korean Air Lines
passenger jet.
   Gorbachev's decision also demonstrated his ability to respond
quickly to events in a country he often complains is bound by its
own bureaucracy.
   Barely four hours before the president's decision was announced
at a surprise late-night news conference Wednesday, chief Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov had dismissed any suggestion
Gorbachev might cut short his stay in New York.
   Although the spokesman acknowledged the situation in the
earthquake-ravaged Caucasus was serious and ``a small village has
practically disappeared from the face of the Earth,'' he told
reporters that relief efforts were being handled routinely by
mobilization of the armed forces and physicians. He noted it was a
natural disaster and gave no indication any presidential action was
necessary or even under consideration.
   Gorbachev at the time was attending a star-studded reception at
the United Nations at the end of a day marked by his announcement of
a dramatic, military force reduction. Earlier in the day, he had bid
a friendly farewell to Reagan, his four-time summit partner, urged
President-elect Bush not to delay the strengthening of U.S.-Soviet
ties and toured New York for the first time.
   A short time later, as other members of his entourage were going
to bed, Gorbachev instructed his foreign minister to round up
reporters for the announcement of his imminent return home.
   The Caucasus calamity took on an added dimension because it
struck a region that for months has been the scene of ethnic strife
between Armenians and Azerbaijanis and more recent nationalist
demonstrations in Shevardnadze's native Georgia.
   The unrest, which has exploded into fatal rioting in several
Azerbaijani cities and sparked massive demonstrations and general
strikes in Armenia, has prompted authorities to deploy troops and
tanks in the streets in some areas. Tens of thousands of refugees
have fled their homes in fear.
   But despite the military presence, Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or openness, also has been evident in the region.
Authorities have tolerated dissent and criticism they once would
have crushed with brutal force.

   President Reagan and his wife Nancy will
undergo annual physical examinations and routine post-cancer-surgery
tests at Bethesda Naval Medical Center on Friday, the White House
announced Thursday.
   Col. John Hutton, the presidential physician, said in a statement
that neither has shown any recurrence of cancer.
   Reagan, who turns 78 in February, had a two-inch cancerous polyp
removed from his colon in July 1985.
   The 67-year-old first lady had her left breast removed in October
1987 after a cancerous tumor was detected.
   Hutton said the couple's exams are scheduled to begin around 1:15
p.m. EST and conclude around 5 p.m. EST. They are slated to travel
from the Maryland hospital to their weekend retreat at Camp David,
Md., afterward.
   Hutton's statement also included a plug for the importance of
such routine examinations.
   ``The first lady continues to emphasize the importance of
mammography (breast X-ray) for early detection of cancer of the
breast. The mammogram remains the most essential diagnostic test for
early detection of a malignancy. Both the president and the first
lady have remained completely asymptomatic, with no clinical
suggestion of recurrance,'' Hutton said.
   The president faces a wider battery of exams than his wife.
   Hutton's statement said Reagan will have a colonoscopy, a chest
X-ray, a CAT scan, a cardiac stress test and a pulmonary function
evaluation.
   The first lady will have her second mammogram since undergoing
the surgery, a modified radical mastectomy.
   Physicans involved in the evaluation will include Hutton and a
colleague in the White House medical unit, Dr. Martin Bacon; Dr.
Bruce Lloyd, a cardiologist; Dr. Thomas Walsh, a specialist in
pulmonary disease; Dr. David Hartman, a radiologist; Dr. Rocco
Volpe, a specialist in gastroenterology; and Dr. Elsworth Weatherby,
a specialist in nuclear medicine. All on the naval hospital staff.
   Also participating will be Drs. Oliver Beahrs, a retired Mayo
Clinic surgeon; his son, Dr. John Randolf Beahrs, who is a physician
in private practice in St. Paul, Minn.; and Drs. Robert and David
Utz of the Mayo Clinic, the statement said.
   The elder Beahrs is an old friend and associate of Mrs. Reagan's
stepfather, the late Dr. Loyal Davis of Chicago.
   In the president's initial cancer surgery, doctors removed the
two-inch cancerous polyp and nearly two feet of colon, as well as
the surrounding tissue.
   Since 1985 and up until last January, Reagan has undergone a
colonoscopy every six months to check for any recurrence of cancer.
In that procedure, a long, flexible instrument that uses fiber-optic
technology is inserted in the large intestine to allow doctors to
see inside the bowel.
   Each time, doctors found polyps _ or small, fleshy growths _ and
removed them. In each procedure, the polyps were found to be
non-cancerous.
   The growths generally cause no serious symptoms but, if left
alone, can grow into cancerous lesions such as the one removed in
1985.
   No polyps were found in Reagan's last colonoscopy, conducted last
January, and he did not have such a checkup at the usual six-month
point over the summer.
   In January 1987, Reagan underwent successful prostate surgery to
relieve what a spokesman called a ``mild, recurring discomfort,''
apparently due to an enlarged prostate gland.

   A piece of the Oval Office floor, a
commemorative jellybean jar, scores of autographed books and other
White House memorabilia are piling up at Ronald Reagan's alma mater,
tiny Eureka College.
   About a dozen boxes of assorted trinkets have come in the past
few weeks, and school officials have been notified to expect many
more presidential odds and ends before Reagan leaves office in
January.
   ``It's interesting and exciting and may be just the tip of the
iceberg,'' said Lynn Beer, director of college relations. ``He knows
we have a display of his memorabilia so he sends anything he feels
is suitable.''
   For now, the boxes are piling up in a small storeroom adjacent to
the office of George Hearne, school president. Most are wrapped in
old Washington Post newspapers and appear in no particular order.
   Hearne said Reagan had notified the school about three months ago
that the materials were available, and Hearne said the school was
interested.
   A small library could be created from the books Reagan has
shipped. Personal messages of good will abound in autographed books
by authors such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ted Kennedy, Henry
Kissinger, Ferdinand Marcos and even Sam Donaldson.
   One box contains small gifts Reagan regularly gave White House
visitors, including a commemorative jar of jelly beans and a
paperweight made from a piece of cork taken from the Oval Office
floor. A note says the cork supported six presidents from 1934-69
before the floor was replaced.
   Other items included an inaugural book set and a belt buckle with
a rodeo cowboy that proclaims ``the buckaroo stops here.''
   Two of the more unusual items were a pair of cowboy boots
emblazoned with the presidential seal and a Plexiglas-enclosed
Wheaties box bearing a photo of the 1988 Super Bowl champion
Washington Redskins.
   Eureka College officials welcome all contributions from the
school's most famous graduate.
   ``President Reagan has a deep affection for Eureka College and
remains consistently in touch with us,'' said Hearne. ``He started
sending us memorabilia as governor of California, including
souvenirs from his career as a movie star as well as his tenure as
governor.''
   The school is planning a permanent display in a new campus center
not far from the Reagan Physical Education Center, and near Reagan
Street.
   Officials plan to invite Reagan to campus in 1992 for grand
opening ceremonies of the campus center and to celebrate his 60th
class reunion. He has been a regular visitor on campus, including
two visits during his presidency.
   Reagan graduated from the private, liberal arts college in 1932
with a degree in social science and economics.

<HEAD>U.S. Armenians Struggle to Find News of Devastating Earthquake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Armenian communities throughout the United States scrambled to
collect donations and medical supplies Thursday to rush to Soviet
Armenia in the wake of an earthquake believed to have killed tens of
thousands.
   International phone lines were flooded by Armenian immigrants
trying to reach relatives and obtain news beyond the sketchy reports
that up to 50,000 people have died and whole villages were wiped out
by Wednesday's temblor.
   ``We can't reach Armenia,'' said Suren Bursalyan, editor of the
Armenian biweekly Paros in California. ``All of the phone lines are
shot. Our only information is American television. It's really hard.
We would like to know the extent of damage.''
   In Southern California, home to the nation's largest Armenian
community, the Western Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church
announced that eight days of mourning would begin Friday, and that
area Armenian churches would hold special requiem services Friday
and Sunday.
   At least 250,000 Armenians, the largest concentration outside of
Soviet Armenia, live in Southern California, mostly in Hollywood and
Glendale.
   Archbishop Datev Sarkissian said he, Like Bursalyan, had been
unable to uncover any information to pass on to parishioners.
   ``Yesterday I was trying to get in touch with Armenia and the
operator was overrun by the telephone calls,'' he said.
   Local Armenians are ``in a state of shock. They are in a state of
grief and great pain,'' the archbishop said. ``But a great relief
operation is being organized by the community to help rebuild the
cities.''
   California Gov. George Deukmejian, himself of Armenian descent,
said, ``As Californians, we are all too familiar with devastating
earthquakes. Although the details are still incomplete, we can all
envision the effect of a reported 6.9 Richter scale earthquake
centered near cities with populations approaching 1 million each.''
   A quake of 6.9 is capable of causing widespread damage. In
addition to Armenia, the temblor caused extensive damage in Georgia
and the Azerbaijan republic in the northern Caucasus.
   A Soviet exchange student attending college in Maine did get
through to her parents. She said that the quake, while devastating,
had spared her family, which lives in the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi.
   ``I talked with my parents and I asked, `Is it true or not?' and
they answered that it was a very hard earthquake,'' said Tamara
Sulukhyia, an exchange student at Bowdoin College.
   Hundreds of people telephoned the offices of Asbarez, a
Glendale-based newspaper catering to the Armenian community. ``The
phones started ringing at 6 o'clock this morning,'' said Abraham
Boghigian, the paper's editor. ``Right now for us here in Los
Angeles, (obtaining information) is very hard.''
   Boghigian said that an affiliated paper in Montreal had
established phone contact with government offices in Armenia, and
the sketchy information obtained (only listing deaths in the ``tens
of thousands'') would be passed along to readers.
   Meanwhile, Archbishop Torkom Manoogian, Primate of the Eastern
Diocese of the Armenian Church in America, said at a news conference
at New York's Armenian cathedral that ``the devastation is heavier
than we can imagine.''
   ``The immediate needs are shelter, medical supplies, clothing and
blood,'' he said.
   Manoogian and a delegation of Armenian prelates from around the
world held the news conference after a one-hour meeting with Soviet
officials at the USSR mission to the United Nations.
   ``We are asking all people of good will and compassion ... to
assist financially,'' Manoogian said.
   The church is coordinating with other relief agencies such as the
Red Cross and the World Council of Churches to ship doctors, nurses
and supplies to Armenia, but he had no immediate details to announce.
   The Boston University School of Medicine set up a phone bank to
coordinate relief locally, along with the Zoryan Institute and other
Armenian organizations. There are some 95,000 Armenians in
Massachusetts.

<HEAD>Aspin: Bush Errs by Not Ending Speculation on Tower Appointment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush may be making ``his first
serious misstep'' by prolonging speculation over whether former Sen.
John Tower will be appointed defense secretary, Rep. Les Aspin said
Thursday.
   Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
was referring to reports circulating since Bush's election last
month that Tower, former chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, will be named to head the Pentagon.
   There have been reports that Bush and his advisers want to name
as many as five top Pentagon officials at one time, including Tower.
   ``If Tower is named defense secretary, he will come into office
in a weakened condition,'' said Aspin, speaking in La Jolla, Calif.,
at a board meeting of Science Applications International. A copy of
his speech was released in Washington.
   ``For one thing, with all that twisting in the wind, questions
will be raised about how much confidence the president has in him,''
Aspin said.
   ``If what we read is correct, Tower won't have much of a hand in
picking the other top figures in the Department of Defense,'' Aspin
said. ``That means that when he goes into a huddle with his
officials, their playbooks will be full of end runs.''
   ``In sum, if nominated, Tower could well enter office already
wounded,'' he said.
   If Bush goes ahead with the Tower appointment, he will need to
back the former Texas senator strongly, Aspin said.
   ``To recover with John Tower, Mr. Bush is going to have to make
it clear his secretary has his emphatic support,'' Aspin said.
``Perceptions on this point are everything.''
   One of the biggest problems of the Bush administration will be
dealing with the budget, particularly Pentagon projections that
large defense spending increases will be needed to pay for programs
begun earlier, Aspin said.
   ``In spite of campaign promises to the contrary, my guess is that
zero real growth _ only enough to offset inflation _ is the very
best that the Pentagon can hope for,'' he said.
   Tower also has been the subject of rumors about his personal
life, particuarly following his 1987 divorce from his second wife,
Lilla.
   The divorce was granted after a legal battle in which she alleged
Tower had committed ``marital misconduct'' during their 10-year
marriage. Tower's deposition responding to the charges was sealed by
agreement of both parties.

   Soviet authorities rushed military surgeons and
tons of medical supplies Thursday into Armenia, rocked by an
earthquake that officials said virtually destroyed several cities
and killed tens of thousands of people.
   Armenian journalists said a Politburo commission led by Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov received preliminary estimates that up to 50,000
people died in the Wednesday earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the
Richter scale. Soviet officials reported thousands of people were
killed but provided no death toll.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cut short his trip to the United
States and flew home to lead a worldwide emergency rescue effort in
southern republic, which has a population of 3.3 million.
   ``Urgent measures are being taken to help all those affected by
this terrible tragedy, and I have to be there in this effort,'' said
Gorbachev, who planned to fly to Yerevan after arriving in Moscow.
He canceled planned trips to Cuba and Britain.
   President Reagan offered emergency humanitarian aid, Cuban
President Fidel Castro pledged to sent construction workers and
Britain dispatched London firefighters to join the rescue effort.
   Soviet TV showed a clock on a building in the city of Leninakan,
on the Turkish border near the epicenter of the earthquake, stopped
at 11:41 _ the instant the disaster struck.
   The earthquake destroyed two-thirds of Leninakan, Armenia's
second-largest city with a population of 250,000 people, a TV
correspondent said.
   Spitak, a town of 16,000 about 45 miles away, ``was practically
erased from the face of the Earth,'' the correspondent said.
   Tass said half the buildings in Kirovakan, a city of 150,000, had
crumbled.
   A special meeting of representatives of all 15 Soviet republics
was called in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, on Friday to discuss
disaster relief.
   Soviet authorities dispatched doctors, engineers and food and
medical supplies to the area, and a ``helicopter bridge'' was set up
to ferry the injured northward to hospitals in neighboring Soviet
Georgia, the Tass news agency reported.
   Tass said 2,300 people were hospitalized in Yerevan with injuries
from the quake and that 200 had been hospitalized across the border
in Georgia. It did not say how many of the injured were treated
elsewhere.
   For a second night Thursday, millions of Soviet TV viewers saw
soldiers searching for survivors and bodies in huge piles of
concrete rubble, either by hand or with cranes. The disaster
coverage by the state-run media was unprecedented in its speed and
scope.
   Ryzhkov, head of an earthquake commission, told Soviet television
the main task before authorities is to search the rubble for the
injured and dead.
   He then turned directly toward the camera and made an unusual
appeal to factory and business officials nationwide not to wait to
be asked, but to start immediately sending heavy cranes, helicopters
and other equipment to the stricken area.
   Friday and Saturday were declared days of mourning in Armenia.
   Soviet TV and the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported from
Leninakan that preliminary estimates were that tens of thousands of
people were killed.
   Foreign Minister spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said authorities were
having difficulty calculating a death toll because communications
with the region were severed.
   He said the Foreign Ministry was reviewing requests by foreign
reporters to visit the disaster area, but that none had been
approved.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said soldiers were working under spotlights
in the wreckage of a Leninakan school. It said two sergeants pulled
the bodies of more than 50 children from the ruins and that only a
few children had been found alive in the collapsed building.
   Blood donations were being collected throughout the Soviet Union
for quake victims. Tons of blankets, field kitchens, tents and
medicine were pouring into the region, Tass said.
   Soldiers were setting up tent cities to house evacuees in the
devastated regions, and restoring electricity and water supplies,
army Gen. Vladimir Arkhipov told Tass. Bonfires burned in the
shattered cities to warm the homeless in the December chill.
   The newspaper Izvestia reported the population of Armenia has
risen markedly in recent weeks as settlers fled violent ethnic
strife between Armenians, who are mostly Christian, and
predominantly Moslem Azerbaijanis.
   About 180,000 refugees reportedly have fled across the border
between the two republics in the last three weeks.
   The last earthquake in the Soviet Union with a death toll in the
thousands was an Oct. 5, 1948, temblor in Ashkhabad, the capital of
Turkmenia. The Soviet press _ acting under Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or greater openness _ recently gave the death toll for the
Ashkhabad quake as 110,000.
   A quake of 6.9 on the Richter scale is capable of causing
widespread damage. The scale is a measure of ground motion as
recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a
tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an
earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.

<HEAD>Tight Security May Have Killed Crucial Mice, Researcher Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The National Institutes of Health researcher
who lost all but three of 130 mice that had been genetically altered
to carry AIDS said Thursday he hopes their apparently accidental
death will lead to less drastic guidelines for isolating such
animals.
   ``Maybe that's the silver lining,'' said Dr. Malcolm Martin, a
top virologist at the national Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.
   Citing the growing importance of animals in AIDS research, Martin
said the accident underscores the difficulty researchers have with
acquiring the large numbers of animals they need while at the same
time operating under strict guidelines to keep the animals from
escaping.
   Martin, who headed the team that developed the unique strain of
mice at the laboratory in nearby Bethesda, Md., said he got a
telephone call at 5 a.m. Monday telling him most of the mice were
dead.
   By Wednesday, Martin and his assistant concluded that it was a
freakishly simple accident: power was turned off in the building for
several hours over the weekend for maintance work.
   As a result, the 30-foot-long glass and steel tube where the mice
were housed under tight security lost ventilation and overheated.
   The accident came just a few days before Martin and his team were
preparing to begin preliminary experiments on the mice to see how
various drugs might act in their bodies.
   It will take at least four or five months to replenish the mice
herd from the three survivors, Martin said.
   The elaborate structure designed to keep the AIDS mice, in
Martin's view, amounted to overkill and made it almost impossible to
breed the large numbers of mice that would be needed for really
significant research.
   ``A good number to keep in mind is that it took 500,000 ...
monkees to test and certify the Salk and Sabin polio vaccines,''
said Martin. ``If we're going to be serious about AIDS research,
we've got to turn more and more to animals systems.''
   He said fellow researchers in California are running into the
same difficulties with breeding the necessary numbers of mice that
have been altered to duplicate the human immune system, a new
development with tremendous implications for AIDS research since
such mice could be injected with the AIDS virus and then subjected
to various drug and vaccine testing.
   While Martin's mice carry the genetic marker for the AIDS virus
in each cell of their bodies, they do not have human immune system
characteristics like the California mice and thus, in some ways, are
not as pure an ``animal model'' for AIDS research as the California
mice.

   Christopher Connelly, who starred in the
television series ``Peyton Place'' and ``Paper Moon,'' died from
cancer at his home, his agent said Thursday. He was 47.
   Connelly _ who died Wednesday night, according to agent Tom
Korman _ was featured as Norman Harrington for five seasons in the
romantic drama ``Peyton Place,'' the first of the prime-time
serials. He was also seen as a guest star in several television
dramas, most frequently in ``Police Story.''
   In the series ``Paper Moon,'' he recreated the role of con-man
Moses ``Moze'' Pray, originated by Ryan O'Neal in the film of the
same name.
   Born in Wichita, Kan., Connelly was the youngest in a family of
seven children. Connelly briefly attended Regis College in Denver,
leaving it to study theater at the Pasadena Playhouse.
   His first professional credits included the television series
``The Eleventh Hour,'' ``Sam Benedict,'' ``Alfred Hitchcock
Presents,'' ``Mr. Novak'' and ``Gunsmoke.'' He also had roles in
``The Lieutenant,'' ``My Three Sons'' and ``Voyage to the Bottom of
the Sea.''
   He appeared in 450 episodes of ``Peyton Place,'' which also
launched the careers of Mia Farrow and O'Neal. He also starred in
European Westerns.
   Funeral services are scheduled Friday in Hollywood Hills.
   Connelly is survived by two sons, Joseph, 11, and Daniel, 9.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A task force of local and federal officials is
being created to help solve the record number of drug-related
killings in the nation's capital, U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said
Thursday.
   ``The escalating violence level in this city, attributable in
large part to narcotics trafficking, threatens the safety of the
people,'' Stephens said.
   So far in 1988, 337 people have been slain in Washington, far
surpassing the previous one-year record of 287 killings set in 1969.
Police estimate 60 percent of the killings are drug-related, and
blame the influx of crack, a potent, highly addictive cocaine
derivative, for many of those slayings.
   Stephens said he has assigned five senior prosecutors and five
investigators to probe drug-related killings. Prosecutors will
decide on a case-by-case basis whether to seek the death penalty,
which Congress approved in the recently enacted drug bill, he added.
   The District of Columbia criminal code does not have a death
penalty, and all cases involving deaths and drugs would be
prosecuted in federal court. Stephens' office is responsible for
prosecuting all serious criminal cases in this city of 625,000.
   District Police Chief Maurice T. Turner hailed the agreement as
``long overdue. The joint effort of homicide detectives and
senior-level prosecutors will help close cases.''
   Stephens said he decided on the plan after investigators told him
that a variety of organized crime groups are making inroads in the
city's drug trade.
   Turner, who previously has said that many of the slayings result
from young entrepreneurs fighting for turf, acknowledged the
importance of the gangs, and added that individual dealers may be
starting to work together.
   The police chief also renewed his support for Operation Clean
Sweep, an anti-drug program that has produced more than 44,000
arrests since it began in 1986. But at the same time, he said drug
treatment, prevention and education programs are needed to solve the
city's drug epidemic.

<TEXT>
   Federal and local trouble-shooters at a special
command center exchanged smiles and handshakes Thursday as Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's plane made its way out of U.S. airspace.
   ``Wheels up,'' shouted Deputy Police Chief Tosano Simonetti as he
watched the departure, which came one day earlier than expected, on
a huge video screen.
   The Soviet leader cut short his visit to return home because of a
severe earthquake in Soviet Armenia.
   Despite the tremendous security concerns involved in Gorbachev's
visit, Simonetti said ``we've been through so many of these things
that it's kind of old hat.
   ``Now that he's gone, we'll start planning something else.''
   More than 20 agencies, including the Secret Service, the FBI, the
Federal Aviation Administration and city emergency, traffic and fire
departments, were represented at the command center at Police
Headquarters.
   Simonetti thanked all the participants for their cooperation.
``We couldn't do it alone,'' he said.
   The last flurry of calls that came into the command center
involved reports of rubbernecking and cars stopped along the
motorcade's route to the airport.
   Simonetti said motorists apparently slowed down or pulled over to
the side to catch one last glimpse of Gorbachev before he returned
to the Soviet Union. Extra highway patrols were dispatched to keep
traffic moving.
   ``I'm glad it's all over,'' said Jack Mulligan of the FAA. ``We
were all scared that something was going to happen.''
   Simonetti said there no major security problems came up during
the abbreviated visit, even though Gorbachev caught police by
surprise when he made two unscheduled stops in midtown Manhattan on
Wednesday as he toured the city in his motorcade.
   He said there had been 15 bomb threats, all unfounded, called
into the 911 emergency number during Gorbechev's stay. Three were
believed to be directed toward the Soviet leader _ two of them at
the United Nations and one at a location that was not disclosed.
   Another concern of the command center, traffic, went as smoothly
as could be expected, according to Gregory Perrin of the city
Department of Transportation.
   He said there were periods of gridlock when streets were closed
for the motorcade, but residents appeared to take it in stride.
   ``They did very well. In terms of traffic, New Yorkers proved to
be road scholars,'' Perrin said.

<TEXT>
   The color returned to Farzaneh Shojaei's wan face
Thursday as she explained why she joined Iranian students in a
12-day international hunger strike to protest recent executions in
their homeland.
   ``As I'm Iranian, I really think it's the least I can do to show
my support for the families of those killed,'' she said on the west
London sidewalk where 50 Iranians have taken turns camping since
their hunger strikes began Nov. 30. Two have been hospitalized for
short periods, she said.
   ``My brother or sister or relatives could be one of those killed.
Fortunately they have not, but they could,'' says Ms. Shojaei, 32,
who has lost 13 pounds since she began the fast that ends Saturday.
   The Union of Moslem Iranian Student Societies said it organized
the hunger strike in 17 countries to protest mass executions in the
country since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the eight-year war with Iraq.
   The opposition Mujahedeen Khalq, the largest Iranian opposition
group seeking to topple the government of Ayatollah Khomeini,
claimed last Friday that 12,000 people have been executed in Iran
since August.
   The group, which is supported by the student union societies,
says the political prisoners, their families, and other supporters
of the Mujahedeen, or People's Holy Warriers, have been killed.
   Two London policeman stood near the low enclosure where the
Iranians, who are drinking only tea and water, sat on benches,
wrapped in blankets to ward off the chill.
   Some stomped their feet or paced as patriotic songs and poems set
to music played quietly from a cassette player. Some have relatives
who were killed, while others are simply sympathizers.
   The U.N. General Assembly's Third Committee, which deals with
human rights matters, approved a resolution Nov. 30 criticizing Iran
for alleged human rights abuses, including the execution of
political prisoners. An earlier United Nations human rights report
on Iran also criticized the Tehran government for the executions.
   ``It's a true massacre which is going on,'' Hussein Abedini, a
spokesman for the hunger strikers, said in an interview.
   Along with the London group, hunger strikes were said to be under
way in New York, Paris, Amsterdam, Bonn, Rome, Geneva, Brussels,
Athens, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Madrid, New Delhi, Ottawa, Sydney,
Vienna and Oslo.
   An estimated 1,000 people worldwide are fasting until Saturday,
the United Nations International Human Rights Day, organizers said.
In London, they will hold a rally and march to mark the end.
   Abedini said the protesters were also fasting to demand Iran's
ouster from the United Nations and its replacement with the
Mujahedeen, and to ask the General Assembly to condemn the current
regime.
   Ms. Shojaei was certain their efforts will help in the long run.
   ``It's got to do something, ... maybe not in the short time,''
she said. ``But it's going to make the situation worse for
(Khomeini) inside and outside Iran.''

   A new album by rock 'n' roll pioneer Roy
Orbison, who died Tuesday, is due out in early 1989.
   ``Mystery Girl'' on Virgin Records will feature guest stars
including U2, Elvis Costello, Albert Hammond, George Harrison, Steve
Cropper, Tom Petty, Billy Burnette and others.
   Funeral services for Orbison, who died of a heart attack at age
52, remained incomplete Thursday. Arrangements were delayed because
his wife was in Germany visiting relatives at the time of his death.
   The singer had been scheduled to fly to Europe next week to film
a second music video as a member of the Traveling Wilburys, a group
that also includes Harrison, Petty, Bob Dylan and Jeff Lynne. Their
album ``The Traveling Wilburys'' is No. 8 on the charts.
   Meanwhile, the singer's band members said this was Orbison's
first full week off in more than six months.
   ``His last words to the band were, `I'll see you in January.
We'll get back together, learn some new songs and have a ball,'''
said Michael Joyce, bass player.
   ``He'd really been working hard,'' Joyce said. ``The crowds have
been getting wilder and wilder. The crowd in Boston (last week) was
shouting `Roy, Roy, Roy' before he went on stage. There was a real
momentum building.''
   David Briggs, a record producer and song publisher, recently
finished producing two songs with Orbison for the forthcoming album.
   ``He was in great spirits, and he seemed to be in relatively good
health,'' Briggs said. ``We worked seven days a week, and he held up
well after midnight. In fact, he held up a lot better than I did.''
   In three decades of performing, Orbison was best known for his
hits ``Oh, Pretty Woman,'' ``Only the Lonely'' and ``Cryin'.''
   Orbison spent Tuesday afternoon and evening playing with
remote-control model airplanes, his hobby. He suffered the heart
attack at his mother's house and died later at a hospital.
   Orbison, who had open heart surgery in 1978, is survived by his
wife Barbara; sons Wesley, 23, Roy Jr., 18, and Alexander, 12; his
mother and a brother.

   The Peace Corps is looking for a few good
teachers to volunteer for a one-year stint in the Philippines.
   Loret Ruppe, the Peace Corps director, said Thursday the teachers
are needed to serve as assistants and advisers to Filipino teacher
trainers.
   While Peace Corps volunteers normally serve two years, the
teachers are being recruited as associate volunteers to serve in
village, provincial, municipal and national schools on the big
island of Luzon.
   The Peace Corps wants to recruit 10 primary and 20 secondary
teachers for the Philippine positions. In addition, at the secondary
level, seven math teachers, seven science teachers and six English
teachers are needed to assist in teacher training on Luzon.
   The teachers recruited would take part in a pre-departure
orientation in San Francisco next April 5 and arrive in the
Philippines on April 9 for eight weeks of training.
   ``We are particularly looking for qualified substitute and
retired teachers to spend a year overseas,'' Ruppe said.
   Those interested can call the teacher education program at
1-800-424-8580, Extension 293, or contact local Peace Corps
recruiting offices.

   The Reagan administration on Thursday welcomed
the move of South African nationalist leader Nelson Mandela to a
house on a prison farm.
   ``We welcome this move as a further step toward freedom for Mr.
Mandela,'' State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley told
reporters.
   ``Nonetheless,'' she said, ``until Mr. Mandela and others
detained and imprisoned from the black community are released
unconditionally from detention, prospects for the peaceful
resolution of South Africa's problems will remain dim.''
   The United States is one of a number countries which frequently
call for Mandela's release from prison.
   On Wednesday the South African government transferred Mandela,
70, from a clinic, where he was recovering from tuberculosis, to a
house at a prison farm northeast of Cape Town.
   Mandela, a leader of the African National Congress, has been
imprisoned since 1962. He was sentenced in 1964 to life in prison on
charges of sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government by
violence.
   The South African Prisons Service said Thursday that Mandela is
not confined to the house and has free use of a wide range of
facilities.

<HEAD>Bukharin Policies, Foreshadowing Gorbachev's, Clashed with Stalin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nikolai Bukharin, the Russian revolutionary leader
whose liberal economic blueprints foreshadowed the Mikhail S.
Gorbachev era, probably lost his mind after realizing Josef Stalin
was determined to destroy him, his widow says.
   In what is billed as her first interview with Western television,
Anna Larina Bukharin has described to the British Broadcasting Corp.
the last heart-rending days before her husband was arrested, tried
on trumped-up charges and shot in 1938.
   ``He wrote Stalin endless letters proving his innocence. ... By
then he was psychologically unbalanced, and I can't say he was by
this time a person in full command of his mind,'' Mrs. Bukharin said
in the interview aired Wednesday night.
   ``So much had landed on him, and on top of it all (he had) a
young wife and son who was virtually newborn, only 10 months old,
and all of this together had a terrible effect on him,'' she said.
   Bukharin was a close friend and adviser of Vladimir Lenin,
founder of the Soviet state who died in 1924. Stalin became dictator
in 1929, and Bukharin clashed with him over economic policy.
   Stalin believed in forced collectivization to modernize Russia, a
feudal country where 80 percent of the population was agrarian.
Bukharin favored a mix of small-scale capitalism and nationalization
of major industries.
   In 1938, Bukharin and other senior officials were arrested on
charges of spying, sabotage and plotting to murder Lenin. They were
convicted at a show trial and executed the same year. Buharin was 49
at the time.
   Fifty years later, on July 9, Bukharin and 15 other veteran
Bolsheviks were posthumously rehabilitated and readmitted to the
Communist Party in a move indicative of Gorbachev's drive to
exorcize the Stalinist ghost from Soviet society.
   Mrs. Bukharin, who is in her mid-70s, and other Soviets recently
interviewed for the film of Bukharin painted a picture of a colossus
of Russian communism and a man of great charm and popular appeal who
at first could not believe Stalin was bent on having him disgraced
and murdered.
   Dmitri Volkogonov of the Institute of Military History in Moscow
told how Bukharin at one point telephoned Stalin, and, addressing
him by his nickname, said: ``Koba, do you really believe that I am
an enemy?''
   Stalin replied: ``Nikolai, calm down, we'll get to the bottom of
things and everything will be OK.''
   During the interview in her Moscow apartment, Mrs. Bukharin was
asked why Bukharin returned to Moscow from Paris in 1936 when he was
in such danger.
   Speaking in Russian through an interpreter, she replied:
``Nikolai didn't have an inkling, no.'
   Stalin's agricultural policies caused catastrophic famine, which
deeply affected Bukharin, said his widow.
   ``He used to go to the Crimea and see the starving children with
swollen tummies. He used to come to my father and relate it all. And
he even burst out crying. It was a terrible episode. He was most
upset by it,'' she said.
   ``But he wept in silence, in his own home,'' said Professor Alec
Nove, a Glasgow University Soviet expert, noting in the film that
there is no record of Bukharin ever making his misgivings public.
   ``He was a loyal member of the party, and Stalin played on
that,'' Nove said. With World War II looming, ``was this the time to
rock the boat? I think Bukharin kept silent not only because the
secret police were hovering on the doorstep, but because he felt it
his duty to keep silent.''
   Bukharin died at age 49, and the location of his grave is
unknown. Mrs. Bukharin spent more than 20 years in exile and prison
camps, separated from her son.
   Professor Anthony Kemp-Welch of Nottingham University said ``the
past closely relates to the present'' in the similarities between
Bukharin and Gorbachev, the Soviet president and party leader.
   ``Gorbachev is the first intellectual in the Politburo since
Bukharin,'' he told the BBC.
   ``That is why the similarities between Bukharin and Gorbachev are
most compelling,'' he said.
   ``They have the same supporters. Both appeal quite directly to an
educated intelligentsia and to the population at large that wishes
to be active in advancing itself economically, whether peasants or
workers, in order to assist the economy as a whole.''

<HEAD>Text of NATO Statement On Reducing Conventional Arms in Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following is the text of a statement
issued Thursday by foreign ministers of the 16-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization concerning a joint position on reducing
conventional arms in Europe.
   1. In their statement ``Conventional Arms Control: The Way
Ahead,'' the heads of state and government participating in the
meeting of the North Atlantic Council in March 1988 emphasized that
the imbalance in conventional forces remains at the core of Europe's
security concerns. We shall be presenting specific proposals at the
negotiating table to redress this imbalance.
   2. We look forward to the early commencement of the two
negotiations we have proposed: one on conventional stability between
the 23 members of the two military alliances in Europe and one on
confidence- and security-building measures among all 35 signatories
of the Helsinki Final Act.
   3. In these negotiations we will be guided by:
   _the conviction that the existing military confrontation is the
result, not the cause, of the painful division of Europe;
   _the principle of the indivisible security of all our nations. We
shall reject calls for partial security arrangements or proposals
aimed at separate agreements;
   _the hope that the new thinking in the Soviet Union will open the
way for mutual agreement on realistic, militarily significant and
verifiable arrangements which enhance security at lower levels.
   4. The major threat to stability in Europe comes from those
weapons systems which are capable of mounting large-scale offensive
operations and of seizing and holding territory. These are above all
main battle tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers. It is in
these very systems that the East has such a massive preponderance.
Indeed, the Soviet Union itself possesses more tanks and artillery
than all the other members of the Warsaw Pact and the alliance
combined. And they are concentrated in a manner which raises grave
concerns about the strategy which they are intended to support as
well as their role in maintaining the division of Europe.
   5. The reductions announced by the Soviet Union are a positive
contribution to correcting this situation. They indicate the
seriousness with which the conventional imbalances which we have
long highlighted as a key problem of European security are now also
addressed by the Soviet government. We also welcome the declared
readiness of the Soviet Union to adjust their force posture. The
important thing is now to build on these hopeful devlopments at the
negotiating table in order to correct the large asymmetries that
will still remain and to secure a balance at lower levels of forces.
For this, it will be necessary to deal with the location,
nationality and the state of readiness of forces, as well as their
numbers. Our proposals will address these issues in the following
specific ways:
   _We shall propose an overall limit on the total holdings of
armaments in Europe. This limit should be substantially lower than
existing levels, in the case of tanks close to a half. This would
mean an overall limit of about 40,000 tanks.

<TEXT>
   Stronger hurricanes spawned by global warming
could cost U.S. insurance companies an extra half-billion dollars a
year in wind and hail damage claims, an insurance company executive
said Thursday in a discussion of the greenhouse effect.
   ``You don't have to wait until 2030 or 2040 to get a sizable
increase'' in claims, Donald Friedman of the Travelers Insurance Co.
said at a conference sponsored by the Climate Institute.
   Most hurricane damage is from ocean water surging inland, driven
by the storm, and Friedman presented no estimate of claims increase
there.
   The institute is a nonprofit group trying to call attention to
the warming of the earth predicted by many scientists to result from
the accumulation of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere
   Friedman, a meteorologist and head of natural hazards research at
Travelers, studied 117 years' worth of records that estimated the
tracks of the 240 hurricanes known to have come ashore in that
period.
   Using a computer model that assumed the peak surface temperature
of the Caribbean would rise at 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit per decade,
Friedman concluded that the hurricane season could begin almost two
weeks earlier and last almost two weeks longer.
   Almost all hurricanes happen between June and November, mostly in
August and September. The higher ocean temperature would make
August-September storms stronger, he said.
   Damage depends on the strength of a storm and where it hits, he
said, but on the average ``you could get about a 30 percent greater
damage production potential,'' he said.
   ``What now happens on June 1 could happen on May 20 ... and what
happens in the middle of November could happen in early December,''
he said.
   Currently, property insurers pay about $1 billion to $1.5 billion
a year in wind and hail damage claims from hurricanes, with large
variations from year to year. This figure could increase by 30
percent, he said.
   In a conference session on Tuesday, James Hansen, a climatologist
with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, quoted one
estimate that peak hurricane wind speeds could reach 220-225 mph,
compared with about 175 mph at present.

   President and Nancy Reagan's 1988 White House
Christmas card, released on Thursday, depicts a colorful holiday
scene of the executive mansion's main hall, with evergreen-draped
marble columns and a table decorated with red poinsettias.
   Some 125,000 of the cards will be mailed out on Dec. 14, the
White House said in a statement accompanying a photograph of the
card.
   The card features a reproduction of a watercolor by the American
artist Thomas William Jones, of Bellevue, Wash. It was the fourth
time the artist was asked to paint a picture for the holiday
greeting card by the president and first lady.
   The painting, entitled ``North Entry Hall at Christmas,'' shows
boughs of evergreens draping the white marble columns of the Cross
Hall, the great hall that leads from the State Dining Room to the
East Room.
   Through the columns, a table purchased by former President Monroe
can be seen, decorated with evergreens and red bows and red
poinsettias.
   The inside of the card carries a greeting in gold engraved
script, ``The President and Mrs. Reagan extend to you warm wishes
that your holidays and the coming year will be filled with happiness
and peace.''
   The presidential seal is embossed in white above the greeting and
1988 below it.
   The five-by-eight-inch card is printed on white paper with a
deckle edge on the bottom.
   Last year, Jones painted a view of the State Dining Room, and has
in other years painted pictures of the East Room and the Blue Room.
   The White House said the cards were printed at cost by Hallmark
and that the Republican National Committee paid the printing and
mailing costs.

   _In our concept of stability, no country should be able to
dominate the continent by force of arms. We shall therefore also
propose that no country should be entitled to possess more than a
fixed proportion, such as 30 percent, of the total holdings in
Europe of the 23 participants in each equipment category. In the
case of tanks, this would result in an entitlement of no more than
about 12,000 tanks for any one country.
   _Limiting numbers and nationality of forces would not by itself
affect the stationing of forces on other countries' territory.
Stationed forces, particularly those in active combat units, are
especially relevant to surprise attack. We shall propose limits on
such forces.
   _Our proposal will apply to the whole of Europe. In order to
avoid undue concentration of these weapon categories in certain
areas of Europe, we shall propose appropriate sub-limits.
   6. To buttress the resulting reductions in force levels in the
whole of Europe, we shall propose stabilizing measures. These could
include measures of transparency, notifications and constraint
applied to the deployment, movement and levels of readiness of
conventional armed forces, which include conventional armaments and
equipment.
   7. Finally, we shall require a rigorous and reliable regime for
monitoring and verification. This would include the periodic
exchange of detailed data about forces and deployments, and the
right to conduct on-site inspections.
   8. Greater transparency is an essential requirement for real
stability. Therefore, within the framework of the CSCE process, the
negotiations on confidence and security-building measures form an
essential complement to those on conventional stability. We are
encouraged thus far by the successful implementation of the
Stockholm document and we consider that the momentum must be
maintained.
   9. In order to create transparency of military organization, we
plan to introduce a proposal for a wide-ranging, comprehensive
annual exchange of information concerning military organization,
manpower and equipment as well as major weapon deployment programs.
To evaluate this information we will propose modalities for the
establishment of a random evaluation system.
   10. In addition, in order to build on the success of the
Stockholm document and to create greater transparency of military
activities, we will propose measures in areas such as:
   _more detailed information with regard to the notification of
military exercises,
   _improvements in the arrangements for observing military
activities,
   _greater openness and predictability about military activities,
   _a strengthening of the regime for ensuring compliance and
verification.
   11. Finally, we shall propose additional measures designed to
improve contacts and communications between participating states in
the military field; to enhance access for military staffs and media
representatives; and to increase mutual understanding of military
capabilities, behavior and force postures. We will also propose
modalities for an organized exchange of views on military doctrine
tied to actual force structures, capabilities and dispositions in
Europe.

   12. We will pursue these distinct negotiations within the
framework of the CSCE (Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe) process, because we believe that a secure peace cannot be
achieved without steady progress on all aspects of the confrontation
which has divided Europe for more than four decades. Moreover,
redressing the disparity in conventional forces in Europe would
remove an obstacle to the achievement of the better political
relationship between all states of Europe to which we aspire.
Conventional arms control must therefore be seen as part of a
dynamic process which addresses the military, political and human
aspects of this division.
   13. The implementation of our present proposals andof those we
are making for further CSBMs (Confidence and Security Building
Measures) will involve a quantum improvement in European security.
We will wish to agree and implement them as soon as possible. In the
light of their implementation we would then be willing to
contemplate further steps to enhance stability and security in
Europe, for example:
   _further reductions or limitations of conventional armaments and
equipment;
   _the restructuring of armed forces to enhance defensive
capabilities and further reduce offensive capabilities.
   Our vision remains that of a continent where military forces only
exist to prevent war and to ensure self-defense, not for the purpose
of initiating aggression or for political or military intimidation.

<HEAD>NHTSA Proposes Requiring Head Restraints on Light Trucks, Vans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Light trucks, multipurpose vehicles and vans
would be required to have head restraints like those now used on
cars under a regulation proposed Thursday by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration.
   Head restraints, designed to prevent neck injury from whiplash
during collisions, have been required on the front seats of
passenger cars since 1969.
   NHTSA opened a public comment period on the proposal, which would
go into effect Sept. 1, 1991, if adopted. The restraints are already
available for some models of light trucks and vans, although they
are not required by federal regulation.
   ``More and more, motorists are using light trucks and vans as
substitutes for passenger cars,'' said Diane Steed, NHTSA
administrator. ``Studies show head restraints are effective in
reducing whiplash injuries to front-seat occupants in automobiles.''
   She said the use of head restraints in light trucks and vans
could prevent up to 6,300 injuries a year.
   The restraints are adjustable extensions to the back of the seats
that keep a passenger's head from snapping slightly backward in the
event of a collision.
   NHTSA estimated rear-impact accidents, which tend to cause
whiplash, are responsible for 51,000 injuries a year to occupants of
light trucks and vans.
   The proposed rule would require the restraints on vehicles with a
gross weight of 10,000 pounds or less.
   U.S. manufacturers of light trucks and other vehicles that would
come under the proposed regulation sold 3.9 million vehicles this
year through November, up 3.5 million from the corresponding period
in 1987.
   NHTSA estimated the regulation would on average add $29.20 to the
cost of a vehicle: $20 for the head restraint and $9.20 in extra
fuel to move the additional seven pounds of weight.
   Approximately 3 million vehicles would be affected by the
proposed regulation, for a total cost of $87.6 million per year,
NHTSA said.
   General Motors Corp. has installed such restraints on some of its
models, the company said from its Washington office.
   GM safety liaison Dick Humphrey was unable to say whether the
company supported, opposed or was neutral on the issue.
   ``We will comment on it (to NHTSA) and give it our best shot,''
he said.
   A spokeswoman for Ford Motor Co., Barbara Mansfield, said in
Washington the company would have no comment until it had seen the
proposed rule. Ford models having ``captain's chairs,'' seats in
vans which swivel, have the head restraints as standard equipment.

<TEXT>
   An aide to Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.
testified Thursday that he frequently used aliases when trying to
gain information for the political maverick.
   Herbert Quinde, who described himself as an investigator for the
LaRouche organization, told LaRouche's federal fraud and conspiracy
trial that he misidentified himself because he described himself as
an ``intelligence and counterintelligence'' agent for LaRouche.
   ``If they knew who I worked for, they wouldn't give me any
information,'' he said. ``You don't think Bob Woodward identifies
himself, do you?''
   Woodward is an assistant managing editor and investigative
reporter for The Washington Post.
   Quinde said he telephoned the late noted attorney Edward Bennett
Williams, gave an alias and then attempted a trade of information.
Quinde said he called Williams because he had heard that Williams,
as a member of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board said at a
meeting that LaRouche ``had used dirty tricks.''
   ``I wanted to find out if he said those things. If he knew I
worked for LaRouche, he would not have told me anything.''
   Quinde, who declined to say what name he used, said Williams
wanted to exchange information with him.
   ``He said, `Kathy Graham is my client. I want to get LaRouche,'''
said Quinde. ``He told me he wanted to nail LaRouche to the boards.''
   Katharine Graham is chairman of the board of The Washington Post
Co.
   Quinde was one of more than a dozen witnesses on the first day of
the defense's case. Odin Anderson, LaRouche's attorney, submitted a
list of over 50 witnesses but told U.S. District Judge Albert V.
Bryan Jr. he believes the defense will complete its case in two or
three days.
   The case was recessed until Monday.
   LaRouche, a four-time minor party presidential candidate who
missed two days of his trial this week because of illness, was in
the courtroom Thursday but said little.
   LaRouche and six associates are charged with mail fraud and
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than $30 million in loans from
individual supporters without any intention of repaying them.
   In addition, LaRouche was accused of conspiring to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service by failing to file income tax returns for
any year since 1978 and having all his personal expenses paid by
various corporations he controls.
   If convicted on all 13 counts against him, LaRouche would face a
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $3.25
million.

   The planes left Dakar, Senegal, earlier Thursday and were bound
for the Moroccan city of Agadir when they came under fire from
ground-to-air missiles, the embassy spokesman said.
   Moroccan government officials said the two planes were fired upon
while they were flying at 10,000 feet to 11,000 feet in an
international navigation corridor over Bir Moghrein, Mauritania.
   The embassy spokesman said the second airplane arrived in Sidi
Ifni, about 240 miles south of Agadir.
   The planes were being used by the U.S. Agency for International
Development to fight the locust plague in North Africa.
   The source of the attack was not immediately known and an
investigation had been launched, the spokesman said.

<HEAD>Jessica Hahn's Contract Not Renewed; Says No Reason Given</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jessica Hahn's first job in radio won't be her
last, she vowed Thursday, even though the former secretary who lead
to the fall of TV-evangelist Jim Bakker said she knew she was hired
as ``a no-talent.''
   KOY-FM, the Phoenix radio station that hired Ms. Hahn as a disc
jockey in August, won't renew her contract when it expires Dec. 31,
general manager Mike Horne said.
   Horne said it was ``really just a matter of the situation that
exists here at the station.''
   ``Jessica is very serious about a radio career, and we all really
appreciate that,'' Horne said. ``She has made tremendous progress in
her role here at the station. It's not so much that we don't think
she could do her own show, it's we just don't have a position for
her.''
   ``I asked, but they didn't give me a reason,'' Ms. Hahn said. ``I
was hired as a no-talent and I know I've improved. I was hired for
my name, I know that. But I know I've improved.''
   Ms. Hahn said she learned her contract wouldn't be renewed the
day before Bakker and three ex-aides were indicted on federal fraud
and conspiracy charges ``so I know that had nothing to do with it.
It wasn't that publicity or anything.''
   A former church secretary who was paid $363,000 to keep quiet
about a sexual encounter with Bakker, Ms. Hahn lived for a time in
the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles, wrote an article for Playboy
about her affair with Bakker, and posed nude for the magazine.
   But her future, she said, is in radio.
   ``I'm going to continue in radio. I truly love it,'' she said.
``I've gotten offers from all over the country, from New York to
Houston. I've also had offers for books and movies. In fact, I think
I've had more offers for movies than for radio. But I love radio.
That's what I want to do.''
   Ms. Hahn said she had no idea where she would go from here, but
is willing to listen to all offers.

<HEAD>Jewish Protesters March on Temple Mount</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 50 young Jews with torches and Israeli
flags marched Thursday to the Temple Mount to demand free Jewish
access and removal of the Dome of the Rock, one of Islam's holiest
shrines.
   ``Some day it will be blown up, and we'll throw out all the
Arabs,'' said 17-year-old Shlomo Boxer, a demonstrator who carried
an Uzi machine gun on his shoulder. ``This is a holy place for Jews,
and it belongs to us.''
   The Temple Mount, which Moslems call the Noble Enclosure, is
sacred to both Jews and Moslems. Jews pray regularly at the Western
Wall, or ``wailing wall.'' It is believed to be the last remnant of
the Second Temple destroyed by the Romans 2,000 years ago.
   The demonstrators, members of a right-wing group called the
Temple Mount Faithful, protested a law requiring Israelis to gain
police permission before praying on the mount, where the Dome of the
Rock shrine sits near the Al Aqsa Mosque. Moslems believe the
prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven at the Dome of the Rock.
   The law is intended to prevent religious friction between Jews
and Moslems in this city that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle
East War and later declared its capital.
   ``The Arabs can carry Palestinian flags inside, but Jews can't go
in and pray when we want,'' said Danny Cohen, 17, referring to
anti-Israeli protests that sometimes take place on the Temple Mount.
``The Arabs shouldn't make the rules.''
   Gershon Solomon, founder of the group, led the flag-waving
procession. Protesters wore T-shirts emblazoned with nationalistic
slogans and chanted ``Israel is not for Arabs.''
   Police would not allow the group to enter until the demonstrators
put aside the flags and agreed to wear their T-shirts inside out. An
officer at the scene, who would not give his name, said police
feared the flags and shirts would ``create disturbances'' among Arab
worshipers.
   Solomon later told cheering supporters through a bull horn that
the government should completely open the Temple Mount to Jews. He
told reporters the Dome of the Rock, built in the seventh century,
should be dismantled and moved to ``a more suitable place.''
   ``This is the heart of the Jewish people,'' he said.
   Police barred reporters from the site and would not allow in more
than 10 demonstrators at once. They said there were no disturbances.
   Soldiers and police in riot gear watched as protesters danced in
circles and lit torches for Hanukkah, the Jewish festival of lights.
   ``I want to show I'm not afraid to be in my country,'' said Haim
Arbel, 17, of Tel Aviv. ``All of this land belongs to us.''

<HEAD>Bhutto's Government Proposes Budget Inherited From Rival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on
Thursday introduced a budget that she inherited from her rivals, and
government officials said Pakistanis must wait for the economic
relief she has promised.
   The spending plan would raise defense spending to 34 percent of
the $7.7 billion operating budget and impose unpopular tax increases
to combat a budget deficit of about $3 billion.
   Ms. Bhutto had campaigned for parliamentary elections last month
on a platform of improving conditions for the poor. The vote
represented the country's first free elections in more than a
decade, and Ms. Bhutto took power Dec. 1 as the first woman to lead
a modern Islamic nation.
   But the populist leader said shortly afterward that her
government faced an impoverished economy on the brink of bankruptcy.
   The budget was put together by a caretaker government appointed
by Ms. Bhutto's archrival, the late Gen. Mohammed Zia-ul Haq, who
died Aug. 17 in an airplane crash. The father of Ms. Bhutto,
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was executed two years after Zia ousted him in
a 1977 military coup.
   The only program Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party introduced
Thursday was a $105 million development program aimed at upgrading
village roads and other facilities. She said they had deteriorated
during Zia's 11-year rule.
   In Thursday's televised budget speech to the National Assembly,
Ehsan-ul-haq Piracha, minister of state for finance, asked people to
be patient.
   ``Our hands are tied. ... It was not possible to amend within two
weeks this budget prepared by the caretaker government.''
   In an interview on the eve of the budget speech, Bhutto's
financial adviser, V.A. Jafaray, tried to lower people's
expectations for the immediate future.
   ``It may not be possible to do anything for the next six
months,'' he said. ``But this government will be in power for five
years.''
   Pakistan faces a foreign debt of $12.4 billion and domestic
borrowing of $15.2 billion.
   Ms. Bhutto also is expected to complete a deal with the
International Monetary Fund within two weeks. The agreement
reportedly would provide $1 billion to bolster the economy of
Pakistan, which would impose austerity measures in exchange.

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers shot a
teen-ager in the heart Thursday, and Palestinians held a general
strike on the first anniversary of their uprising against Israel's
21-year occupation.
   The death of Yussef Mohammed Sbaith, 17, raised the number of
Palestinians killed to at least 320 since the rebellion began Dec.
8, 1987, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Eleven Israelis have been
slain and more than 7,000 Palestinians have been wounded.
   An army spokesman said Sbaith was shot in the heart when troops
were stoned during a sweep of the West Bank village of Kafr Rai.
   Soldiers also wounded a 22-year-old woman in the leg after
meeting ``violent resistance'' from stone-throwing youths in the
village, said the spokesman, whose name cannot be revealed under
army rules.
   Hospital officials said a 23-year-old man suffered head injuries
from a beating by troopers.
   Army gunfire wounded 11 other Palestinians, including a
14-year-old boy shot in the stomach, Arab doctors said. The clashes
occurred in the West Bank's largest city, Nablus, in the villages of
Kabatiya and Beit Lid to the north and in Gaza City, they said.
   An army spokesman confirmed six of the woundings, three in Nablus
and three in Beit Lid.
   Arab witnesses said two of the wounded were hit by bullets fired
from the window of a house the army used as a lookout post in the
open-air Nablus market, the center of many clashes between soldiers
and Arab youths.
   Palestinians closed businesses and halted public transportation
throughout the occupied territories.
   The underground leadership, which the Palestine Liberation
Organization supports, called the strike for the anniversary of the
revolt in the occupied lands. Israel captured the West Bank from
Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Israeli military authorities clamped a curfew on the entire Gaza
Strip, confining more than 650,000 Palestinians to their homes. The
curfew was announced on Israel television and over loudspeakers in
the area.
   Despite the curfew, Palestinian youths shot red and white
fireworks in Gaza City to mark the anniversary of the uprising.
   Residents of the old city also said people shouted ``Allahu
Akbar,'' or ``God is great,'' a traditional rallying cry of Moslems.
   The intefadeh, the Arabic word for uprising used even by the
Israelis, has generated international sympathy and a new sense of
purpose and identity among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the
occupied lands.
   Throughout the Gaza Strip, Palestinians erected roadblocks and
burned tires in sporadic acts of defiance Thursday. About 20
Palestinian youths were seen lobbing rocks from a barricaded alley
in Gaza City.
   A second strike is scheduled for Friday.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Israel television that
dealing with the uprising was ``a very uncomfortable mission'' for
the army.
   ``This is a confrontation of mostly civil violence,'' he said.
``Ninety percent of the incidents are concerned with rocks,
roadblocks or burning tires. Only about 10 percent of the incidents
are firebombs, perhaps even less.''
   In Amman, Jordan, a rally to commemorate the anniversary of the
Palestinian uprising ended in a fist fight between members of
opposing factions.
   Supporters of the Corrective Movement of the Palestine Liberation
Organization attacked people shouting slogans praising Fatah, the
main PLO faction headed by Yasser Arafat. Atallah Atallah, who heads
the Corrective Movement, seeks to unseat Arafat.
   No serious injuries were reported, but at least three Fatah
members were thrown out a first-floor window.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Spent Nearly $35 Million in Closing Blitz</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis put on a
blizzard of last-minute campaign spending, for a combined total of
$33.8 million in the final days of their presidential contest,
financial disclosure forms showed Thursday.
   Dukakis outspent his Republican rival by more than $2 million in
the last 2{ weeks, but he ultimately failed to stop Bush's march to
victory.
   Their financial reports filed with the Federal Election
Commission covered the period from Oct. 20 to Nov. 28, including
bills that were paid off after the Nov. 8 election.
   Dukakis, who won only 10 states and the District of Columbia,
poured out $18 million for his last stand _ much of it going into a
TV campaign that featured the Democratic governor of Massachusetts
talking to the camera in an intimate manner designed to make him
seem less rigid.
   In the preceding month, Dukakis had spent $10.4 million.
   The price tag for Bush's final push came to $15.8 million, as he
put on his own barrage of commercials and zigzagged across the
country campaigning in battleground states.
   Dukakis showed $42.5 million in net spending for the entire
campaign, Bush's $45.3 million.
   The net expenditures reflect actual spending on the campaign, not
including such reimbursable costs as payment for charter plane seats
used by the traveling press corps.
   Dukakis' campaign treasurer, Robert Farmer, said Thursday the
Democrats have no reason to feel badly about spending so much money
and not winning more states.
   ``We have nothing to be ashamed of,'' he said. ``It was a very
negative campaign and we probably weren't prepared for that and we
could have responded earlier.''
   Still, Farmer said, Dukakis ran close in several states he did
not win, and made a far better showing than Democratic nominee
Walter Mondale who won only his home state of Minnesota and the
District of Columbia four years ago.
   ``We are very proud,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Farmer noted that in addition to the spending by the Dukakis
campaign itself, the Democratic National Committee raised a record
$68 million for the election. He said this ``created a level playing
field'' for the first time with the traditionally better heeled
Republican National Committee.
   The 380,000 people who gave money to the DNC ``demonstrated there
was a lot of commitment to the Democratic party and to Michael
Dukakis,'' Farmer said.
   Each candidate received $46 million from the federal Treasury to
pay for their campaigns. The money comes from the voluntary $1
checkoff on individual income tax returns.
   Both campaigns showed receipts and expenditures in excess of that
amount, due to differing accounting practices.
   Bush borrowed start-up money from the separate fund that is used
to pay for legal and accounting compliance with federal election
law. In Dukakis' case, it reflected his compliance fund reimbursing
his campaign committee for such legal and accounting expenses, said
accountant Mary Wong.
   Dukakis still had bills of $1.7 million, with $4 million
available in the bank to pay them off and another $4 million in
receivables.
   Bush had $807,155 in cash on hand, with bills of $764,597 and
$911,667 owed to the campaign.

   Police investigating the nation's worst-known
serial murder case reaped bushels of new clues as thousands of
people called in tips during a nationwide television show on the
Green River killings.
   At least two callers claimed to be the person who has killed at
least 40 young women in the Northwest since 1982, but police were
unsure whether either call was authentic.
   More than 16,000 calls were logged Wednesday, and phones
continued ringing Thursday in response to the show about the Green
River and other serial-murder cases, while investigators began
placing the crime tips in order of priority.
   What were considered to be 1,500 good tips had been logged by
noon Thursday, said King County's Green River Task Force spokesman
Dan Nolan. He said he didn't know exactly how many calls had come in
by then.
   By midnight Wednesday, 1,100 interesting tips had been culled
from a total of 16,540 calls, Nolan said. He didn't know how many
pertained specifically to Green River.
   ``If we don't solve a couple of murders out of this I'll just be
astounded,'' said Bob Evans, commander of the county's Green River
Task Force.
   An estimated 50 million people in the United States and Canada
watched Wednesday night's two-hour show, which producers called the
most ambitious ``manhunt'' TV project ever undertaken. It was
syndicated to TV stations in 150 metropolitan markets by Lexington
Broadcasting of New York.
   Police have made no arrests since finding the first victims in
the Green River south of Seattle. The murderer is blamed for killing
40 women, most linked to prostitution and street life. Another eight
missing women are listed as potential victims.
   Montgomery denied that the movie was a last-ditch effort to solve
the murder case before further staff cuts are forced in the county
task force, already pared to 13 from a one-time high of 40 people.
   But he said authorities hope the movie approach, one which ``has
probably never been tried before,'' will give investigators the
crucial clue. A reward of $100,000 has been offered for information
leading to the killer's arrest.
   ``The response has been absolutely incredible,'' said Lou Gorfain
of New Screen Concepts of New York, executive producer of ``Manhunt:
A Chance to End the Nightmare.''
   ``There weren't, surprisingly, that many crank calls.''
   Seventy law enforcement officers from across the country, trained
to evaluate the information's usefulness, staffed 50 telephone lines
during the show. Some will remain as long as calls come in
regularly, Montgomery said.
   Included was an investigator from San Diego, where 38 women have
been killed since 1985 in a case sharing several similarities with
the Green River case. No definite link, however, has been
established between the two.
   Two men claimed to be the Green River killer in calls to the
television studio in Seattle and to a TV station in San Diego, Evans
said.
   The California call was ``taunting ... saying, `Yes, I did it and
you'll never catch me,''' Evans said, adding that it probably was a
crank.
   The Seattle caller was an ``adult male, very calm voice, claiming
to be the killer and agreeing to mail us some photographs and maps
to lead us to other bodies,'' Evans said.
   Calls couldn't be traced because of the nationwide, toll-free
number that was used, and because Crime Stoppers guarantees
anonymity to its tipsters, Evans said.
   The TV special was sponsored by Crime Stoppers, an organization
founded 12 years ago to help police through radio and television
broadcasts depicting unsolved crimes.
   ``With all the leads that came in for the crimes, it proves the
Crime Stoppers format works,'' said Dan Fine, publicity chairman for
Seattle-King County Crime Stoppers. ``I think it touched a lot of
people's hearts. People were riveted to their TV sets.''
   The program was especially difficult for families of victims to
watch.
   ``I felt exactly like I did the day they came to my house and
told me,'' said Suzanne Villamin, whose 25-year-old daughter's
remains were found in 1984. ``It feels like something inside just
died. Sometimes I wish I would die so I can be with my daughter.''
   ``Every time I saw my daughter's picture on the wall (in the
television program), it became very hard,'' said Marilyn Harrison,
whose missing daughter, Kase Ann Lee, is a suspected Green River
victim. ``But I felt it was necessary for me to watch.
   ``If there's a chance to find the monster, maybe this is the only
thing that will do it.''

   The state Supreme Court turned down an
appeal Thursday from 10-term Democratic Rep. Bill Chappell seeking
to throw out votes from a county that cost him the election.
   In a unanimous opinion, the court ruled Flagler County election
officials substantially complied with a deadline for reporting
election results, but Chappell still has not conceded.
   Chappell will read the opinion before deciding whether to appeal,
said press secretary Kay Thomas.
   Republican Craig James, a DeLand attorney and political newcomer,
defeated Chappell by 791 votes in final certified results of the
recounted Nov. 8 election.
   Chappell asked the Florida court to invalidate the Flagler County
votes, claiming county election officials didn't submit returns to
state officials within a seven-day deadline of the election.
   Had the court agreed, Chappell would have won by 229 votes.
   The justices said Flagler election officials ``substantially
complied'' with the deadline by telephoning the results before the
deadline. They noted the results were then transmitted by facsimile
machine one day later.
   Justice Parker Lee McDonald, writing for the court, said to throw
out the Flagler results would deny voters in that county their
constitutional rights.
   ``There has been substantial, and perhaps complete, compliance,''
he wrote. ``Chappell has presented no compelling reason for
disenfranchising the 11,000 residents of Flagler County who cast
their ballots on Nov. 8.''
   Chappell had been hampered during the campaign by persistent
reports that he was part of a probe into contract mismanagement by
the Pentagon. No charges have been filed.
   Meanwhile, Gov. Bob Martinez's general counsel, Peter Dunbar,
said he has no plans to recommend sanctions against Flagler
Elections Supervisor Etta Peterson.
   After an investigation earlier this year into illegal wiretapping
in her office, Mrs. Peterson entered a deferred-prosecution
agreement with the state attorney's office that said she will not be
prosecuted if she doesn't break any laws.
   She was accused of taping telephone conversations in the summer
of 1987 of a man she thought might run against her. As part of the
agreement, she wrote the man an apology.

   President-elect Bush promised black Republican
loyalists Thursday that they ``will be pleased'' with his
appointments over the long run, but he refused to be specific about
naming blacks to his Cabinet, they said.
   ``We have great hopes,'' said Joshua Smith, one of 60 black
Republicans who met with Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle
for about 40 minutes to discuss jobs and policy issues important to
blacks.
   ``We have confidence he is going to follow through on his
promise.''
   Smith, of Rockville, Md., said the blacks expressed their concern
that Bush has yet to name a black to one a high-level job.
   ``Obviously that concern did come up,'' Smith said. ``His
response was that we will over the term be pleased. He did not make
any specific commitments as to numbers and individuals.''
   The session between Bush and his GOP supporters was friendly and
without rancor, members of the group said.
   Arthur Fletcher, a businessman from Washington and a former
official in the Nixon and Ford administrations, said ``one of the
tragedies of the moment right now'' is that the Bush people would
have to ``look all over the place'' to find qualified black
Republicans for good jobs.
   The GOP, he said, needs to lure more blacks into the fold.
   Bush told the blacks that he meant what he said about ``wanting
to be a president for all the people,'' and he promised to carry out
his campaign pledge to ``speak out against the remaining vestiges of
prejudice and bigotry and whatever.''
   Bush told the group about his telephone call to Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev earlier in the day in which he offered
condolences for the ``horrible disaster situation'' caused by an
earthquake in Soviet Armenia.
   The ``very good meeting'' between Bush, President Reagan and
Gorbachev in New York on Wednesday was marred only by the
earthquake, Bush said. The disaster ``put a cloud and a damper on
the visit at the end,'' he said. Gorbachev cut short his trip to the
United States to return to the Soviet Union.
   Reagan and other U.S. officials offered U.S. aid, if needed, and
Bush said the ``American people will want to hold out their hands to
those families who lost loved ones.''
   ``Nobody really knows the numbers of people killed, but I had an
opportunity to tell him how strongly Barbara and I feel in human
terms about that loss,'' Bush said.
   The blacks gave Bush a standing ovation as he entered the room
where they had been engaged in a question-and-answer session with
Vice President-elect Dan Quayle. Also attending the meeting was Lee
Atwater, whom Bush has recommended as the next chairman of the
Republican National Committee.
   Spokeswoman Sheila Tate said Bush would be ``soliciting the
advice from black leaders on people to serve in all levels of
government.'' On Friday, the vice president will meet with Benjamin
Hooks, head of the NAACP.
   In advance of Thursday's meeting, Les Range, a black businessman
from Jackson, Miss., said he was disappointed no blacks had been
tapped so far.
   ``I want to make sure there are blacks in the Cabinet,'' Range
said. ``But the way things are shaping up, there's not much left.''
   Bush has made almost a dozen high-level appointments, including
nine that have Cabinet status. Among those selected are one woman,
Carla Hills, named as the U.S. trade representative, and one
Hispanic, holdover Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos.
   If no blacks are placed at the head of Cabinet agencies, Range
said, he will urge Bush to name them to sub-Cabinet-level jobs.
Bush, he said, is ``sensitive to the needs of minorities.''
   Several blacks have been mentioned for visible jobs in the new
administration. For instance, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, president of
the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, is under consideration
for secretary of health and human services.
   Sullivan said he has told Bush transition aides that he was
interested in the No. 1 job at that department but not in the second
job.
   Robert Woodson, a black businessman from North Carolina, is also
in the running for secretary of housing and urban development. But
the leading prospect seems to be Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.
   Alan Keyes, a former State Department official who ran
unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in Maryland this year, was
thought to have a shot at becoming U.N. ambassador. Instead, that
position was given to Thomas Pickering, a career diplomat who has
served as ambassador in El Salvador, Israel, Nigeria and Jordan.
   Pickering played a minor role in the Iran-Contra affair while he
was in El Salvador. He testified before Congress that he had
assisted in arranging a secret donation of more than $1 million to
the Nicaraguan Contras at the time the United States was prohiited
from aiding the rebels.
   Tate dismissed questions about Pickering's role. ``All of the
questions that have been raised have been reviewed. ... There is
nothing remotely illegal,'' she said.
   Bush, his voice hoarse because of a cold, made his comments on
the Armenian earthquake at a picture-taking session for the
unveiling of the inaugural license plate. He attached the red, white
and blue plate with the No. 1 on it to his black limousine.

   Nancy Reagan whisked President Reagan from his
Los Angeles hotel to show him a prospective Bel Air home, insisting
he hide from reporters on the floor of the back seat of her car, the
first lady's spokeswoman said Thursday.
   The incident occurred when the Reagans were vacationing in
California at a time when an investment group was considering the
purchase of the expensive home for the Reagans' use after they left
office, the spokeswoman, Elaine Crispen, said.
   The first lady wanted Reagan to see the house ``before the deal
was closed,'' Mrs. Crispen said in response to a reporter's question.
   ``I put him on the floor of the back seat of the car,'' Mrs.
Crispen quoted the first lady as saying. A Secret Service agent was
driving, and there may have been other agents in the car or in chase
vehicles, Mrs. Crispen said.
   Normally, the president travels in an armored limousine,
accompanied by a motorcade consisting of more than a dozen vehicles,
including a van containing Secret Service agents armed with
submachine guns. Other cars transport additional Secret Service
agents, special communications gear, police cars, an ambulance and
members of his staff and the press.
   The spokeswoman defended the first lady's action, saying it
allowed the couple ``to make a decision in private.''
   ``It doesn't bring up a question of security because he went and
he returned in good health,'' Mrs. Crispen said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the incident occurred
sometime prior to his becoming Reagan's chief spokesman in February
1987.
   The Reagans decided last March to lease, rather than buy, the
$2.5 million estate. It is located in the luxurious Bel Air district
and is owned by Wall Management Services, a group of about 20
friends of the Reagans who bought it with them in mind.
   The three-year agreement gives the Reagans the option to renew
the lease or purchase the property. The estate includes 1\ acres of
ground and a secluded house with 6,500 feet of living space and a
pool.
   Wall Management bought the estate on Aug. 21, 1986, from a
90-year-old woman who the investors said would lease it back from
them until the Reagans were ready for it.

<HEAD>Attorney General Blasts Greece's Explanation for Freeing Suspect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Thursday
characterized as ``deplorable'' the Greek justice minister's
explanation for freeing a suspected terrorist in a 1982 attack on a
Rome synagogue.
   Thornburgh met in Athens with Greek Justice Minister Vasos Rotis
to express the U.S. government's deep concern over the decision to
free Abdel Osama Zomar, the Justice Department said in a statement
released in Washington.
   Zomar, a 27-year-old Palestinian, was expelled to Libya after
serving a sentence in Greece for smuggling arms. He is suspected of
membership in the Abu Nidal terrorist group and allegedly helped
organize the attack on Rome's main synagogue.
   The Italian government had sought Zomar's extradition from Greece
to prosecute him for the attack, which killed a 2-year-old child and
injured 37 other people.
   Rotis had justified his freeing of Zomar by calling his attack on
the synagogue ``an act of freedom,'' according to the Justice
Department statement.
   ``I told the minister that this explanation was deplorable,''
Thornburgh said.
   On Wednesday the Justice Department filed additional documents
with the Greek Supreme Court as part of an effort to extradite
another suspected Palestinian terrorist, Mohammed Rashid.
   Rashid has been accused in the United States with the 1982
bombing of a Pan American World Airways airliner that killed a
15-year-old boy and wounded 15 others.
   Rashid was arrested last May in Athens on other charges.
   The Justice Department statement quoted Thornburgh as saying
Rotis told him only that freeing Zomar would not serve as precedent
for the U.S. extradition request for Rashid.

<HEAD>Two Atlanta Shelters Require Homeless To Show ID</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of Atlanta's homeless have found themselves
in a Catch-22 because two shelters, including the city's largest,
won't admit them without photo identification such as a driver's
license.
   Drivers' licenses carry home addresses _ something homeless
people don't have.
   Jay Coppock, director of the 350-bed Salvation Army shelter,
estimated that between 20 and 25 people who lack identification are
turned away each night.
   The Salvation Army shelter and the 25-bed Gospel Light Rescue
Mission admit homeless people with a state or international driver's
license, a passport, an employee photo ID or some state-issued
identification.
   Salvation Army officials said military discharge papers or a
birth certificate with an embossed seal and a Social Security card
are also acceptable.
   Coppock said his shelter requires the photo identification to
prevent homeless people from using multiple IDs to escape the $7
nightly fee for staying at the shelter more than one night. The
first night is free.
   He added that identification is crucial in finding housing and
work.
   ``People come back time and time again and expect a handout,''
Coppock said. ``Our job is to get these people back into society and
to make them contributing individuals.''
   Gospel Light spokesman Roger Clark said homeless people without
identification are allowed to eat, but cannot spend the night at the
shelter.
   Advocates for the homeless are outraged.
   The practice ``doesn't go on in any other city in America that I
know of,'' said Mitch Snyder, a national advocate for the homeless
in Washington, D.C. ``This is what goes on in South Africa. ... Why
not demand that people have an apartment before they come into
shelters?''
   ``It does no good to teach somebody a lesson if they're going to
be dead on the streets next week,'' said Keith Summa, project
director of the National Coalition for the Homeless.
   ``If all the shelters went to this, we would be in a mess,'' said
Jim Beaty, executive director of Atlanta's Task Force for the
Homeless. ``We assume places like the Salvation Army have good
reasons for asking for ID, although we do not want anyone to remain
cold and hungry because they don't have a photo ID.''
   Coppock said there are exceptions to the identification policy,
which has been in effect for years. ``If someone has gotten mugged
and has no ID or is dropped off by the police or referred through
another agency and we can verify it, we will work with them,'' he
said.
   In freezing temperatures, he added, ``We pretty much let in as
many people as we can.''
   J.D. Coleman, spokesman for the state Department of Public
Safety, said a state photo ID can be obtained for $4.50 plus a
``reasonable'' form of ID.

<TEXT>
   Nations and organizations around the world responded Thursday to
the earthquake in Soviet Armenia with offers of aid ranging from
blankets to high-tech equipment aimed at detecting life under the
rubble.
   Armenian journalists said a Politburo commission led by Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov heard preliminary estimates that up to 50,000
people died in Wednesday's quake. Officials said several cities in
the southern region were virtually destroyed.
   The Soviet Red Cross appealed for international aid, including
cash, medical supplies and food.
   In Geneva, the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
said it opened a special Aid to Armenia account to receive
contributions.
   A statement by the world Red Cross body said aid pledges were
received from the national societies in the United States, Britain,
Bulgaria, France, Greece and Norway.
   Immediate needs cited by the Soviets were antibiotics, disposable
syringes and needles, blood substitutes, blood collection
containers, blood-transfusion equipment, canned meat and fish, dried
fruits and porridge, the league said.
   The West German Red Cross said it was ready to send 20,000
blankets and 1,000 tents and was offering $115,000 in aid. West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also offered emergency aid to the
Soviet government.
   ``We want to help within our capabilities, we are ready to give
relief aid to the victims,'' Kohl said in a telegram to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   British officials said four London firefighters will travel to
Armenia on Friday with heat-detecting cameras and ultra-sensitive
microphones to detect minute sounds of life under the rubble.
   British rescue workers used the cameras to locate trapped people
after a 1985 earthquake in Mexico City, and helped save three babies
trapped in the ruins of a destroyed hospital. About 9,500 people
were killed in that quake.
   ``In that disaster, people were being removed from the debris a
week after the earthquake,'' said Londong Fire Brigade officer Paul
Quick.
   The Swiss Disaster Relief Corps offered to send rescue experts
and search dogs to help locate earthquake victims, a spokesman said.
   The government agency had not received a reply by Thursday
afternoon, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He said
Turkey, which suffered less damage from the quake than the Soviet
Union, declined a similar offer.
   In Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro offered to send a
contingent of construction workers to help rebuild areas devastated
by the temblor.
   Castro made the offer in a message to Gorbachev, who was to have
begun a three-day visit to Cuba on Friday but cut short his trip in
New York to return home to deal with the crisis.
   President Reagan told Gorbachev before the Soviet leader returned
to Moscow: ``If there is any way we can be of assistance, either
bilaterally or through the international community, please let me
know.''
   Later, Reagan was asked whether he expected the United States to
be providing assistance. ``They haven't asked for any yet,'' he
replied.
   The United States will be providing antibiotics and other
medicines, said Richard F. Schubert, president of the American Red
Cross in Washington.
   Soviet officials have ``airlifted in about 15 tons of blankets,
tents, first aid kits,'' Schubert said. ``Armenia at this point in
the year is pretty cold, and so there is a critical need for
emergency shelter.''
   The Red Cross has activated a toll-free number for people to call
to offer assistance. The number is 1-800-453-9000.

<HEAD>Court Blocks Random Drug Testing of USDA Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court Thursday barred the Agriculture
Department from randomly testing 755 employees for illegal drug use
without a ``reasonable, articulable'' suspicion of an individual's
on-the-job impairment.
   The preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Thomas
Flannery blocks USDA from forcing the employees to submit to random
testing of their urine to spot illegal drug use under President
Reagan's initiative for a drug-free workplace.
   The action came in response to lawsuits by two employees unions
representing 750 animal disease and plant inspectors and five
computer operators and drivers at USDA's Food and Nutrition Service.
   Flannery ruled that the government could not justify the
intrusive search of the employees, noting that ``the number of
drug-related incidents in the past five years ... is infinitesimal
when compared to the number of employees at USDA.''
   ``While the court acknowledges that random drug testing might
deter drug use, the fundamental values of individual liberty and
privacy embodied in the Fourth Amendment cannot be sacrificed for
the sake of mere effficiency,'' Flannery said.
   The government's interest in assuring a drug-free workplace
``fails to offset the increased intrusion into the legitimate
expectations of privacy of the employees subject to the proposed
testing,'' Flannery said.
   But the judge ruled that the Reagan administration could require
employees suspected of drug abuse on the job to undergo testing.
   Such testing could only be conducted following a ``reasonable,
articulable, and individualized suspicion that a specific employee
may be under the influence'' of illegal drugs, Flannery said.
   Last summer, another federal judge in Washington cited the same
Fourth Amendment considerations in enjoining the Justice Department
from randomly testing many of its employees.
   That case, like several others involving random drug testing of
government workers, is on appeal.
   A federal appeals court last month indicated it might rule in
favor of random drug testing of government workers whose jobs
directly affect the safety of others, notably pilots, air traffic
controllers and civilian guards at munitions depots.
   Those cases are still being reviewed by the appeals court here.
   The Supreme Court, meanwhile, is reviewing drug testing of U.S.
Custom Service employees and railroad crews involved in accidents.
   But Flannery said neither safety nor security was a justification
for testing the USDA employees in the program at issue.
   Flannery also rejected arguments that drug-testing was necessary
to protect the integrity of the plant and animal disease inspection
program. The inspectors who check plants and animals at border
checkpoints ``are administrative employees, not law enforcement
officers.''
   ``They do not carry weapons and are not authorized to make
arrests,'' Flannery said.
   The three drivers at the Food and Nutrition Service do not have
special licenses to operate shuttle buses and the two computer
operators deal with records of the food-stamp program, Flannery
noted.
   ``The court notes initially that the sensitive computer
information at issue here does not relate to our national security.
While in no way denigrating the importance of the war against
poverty, the information at issue here is of a different (and less
compelling) degree entirely.''
   Flannery's ruling was made on lawsuits by the National Treasury
Employees Union and the National Association of Agricultural
Employees. The decision was released as USDA employees at the U.S.
Forest Service filed suit to challenge random drug testing.
   USDA officials could not be reached to comment on the decision.

   Former White House aide Lyn Nofziger told
President Reagan he wouldn't accept a presidential pardon for
ethics-law convictions because he wants to be vindicated in the
courts, his lawyer said Thursday.
   At the same time, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
that first lady Nancy Reagan ``was given to understand'' that
another former Reagan aide, Michael K. Deaver, had discussed a
pardon with someone in the White House.
   Deaver, however, said he never had discussed a pardon for his
three perjury convictions with the president, the first lady or any
government official.
   Nofziger wrote a letter to the president ``a number of weeks
ago'' to state his refusal to accept any pardon that might be
contemplated before Reagan leaves office next month, said defense
attorney E. Lawrence Barcella.
   ``He happens to be an honorable guy who strongly believes in his
innocence and consequently felt that his vindication should come
through the courts and not through the president,'' Barcella said.
   ``It was something purely on his own initiative,'' Barcella said
of Nofziger's letter.
   Nofziger, 63, is free on bond while appealing a 90-day sentence
and $30,000 fine he received earlier this year for three felony
ethics-law convictions.
   He was found guilty of lobbying former Reagan administration
colleagues on behalf of private clients after he resigned in early
1981 as White House political director. He was convicted of
violating the one-year ban on lobbying by former officials after
leaving office.
   Reagan repeatedly has ruled out a pre-trial pardon for former
White House aide Oliver North, who is one of four people under
indictment in the Iran-Contra affair. The president last week said
even considering such a pardon ``would leave them under a shadow of
guilt for the rest of their lives. I think the law has got to take
its course.''
   Nofziger, who likened his offense to running a stop sign, has
repeatedly professed his innocence and criticized the Ethics in
Government Act for not imposing lobbying restrictions on former
members of Congress as well as officials of Cabinet agencies.
   A federal appeals court that heard arguments on the case Nov. 22
appeared receptive to arguments by Nofziger's attorneys that the
conviction should be overturned because prosecutors didn't prove a
willful violation of the law.
   Members of the three-judge panel questioned whether the statute
provided a clear warning to former officials of what would
constitute illegal lobbying.
   Barcella said Nofziger wrote Reagan before the appellate panel
heard arguments in the case.
   Deaver, the former deputy White House chief of staff, said in
response to a reporter's question: ``I have never discussed a pardon
with the Reagans, either or them, and I don't have any intention
to.''
   Deaver was given a suspended three-year sentence, fined $100,000
and ordered to perform 1,500 hours of community service for lying to
Congress and a grand jury investigating his lobbying business for
possible ethics-law violations. He is appealing the three felony
convictions.
   Deaver also denied raising the pardon issue in discussions or a
letter to anyone in government. ``I never wrote anybody a letter
about a pardon.''
   Deaver refused to further discuss the issue of a pardon.

<TEXT>
   A state Public Service Commissioner and a
former commissioner were indicted Thursday on federal bribery and
conspiracy charges stemming from their $165 million lawsuit
settlement and approval of a major rate hike in 1985.
   Commissioner D.W. Snyder and former commissioner Lynn Havens, who
resigned his post Jan. 11, were named in the 26-page, 19-count
indictment. Nielsen Cochran, the third public service commissioner,
was not charged.
   Also indicted were Travis Ward, 68, a Dallas oilman whose
interests include the exercise equipment company Nautilus
Sports-Medical Industries Inc., and businessman Thurston Little, 68,
of Corinth, officials said.
   On Sept. 20, 1985, the three-member commission approved a $165
million settlement of a 13-year-old breach of contract lawsuit filed
by Mississippi Power & Light Co. against United Gas Pipeline of
Houston, an MP&L supplier.
   According to the indictment, Havens received $50,000 from Ward
and Snyder got $16,000 from Little, Ward's alleged intermediary, for
telling MP&L officials they must settle the lawsuit to gain approval
for the rate hike.
   Ward, Havens, Snyder and Little were charged with one count each
of conspiracy; Ward was charged with 13 counts of travel in
interstate commerce to bribe public officials; and Havens and Snyder
were each charged with three counts of accepting bribes.
   Little also was indicted in Philadelphia last month on charges he
defrauded the federal government in connection with a defense
contract with his defunct company Dixie Sportswear Inc., officials
said.
   Investigators wouldn't say whether MP&L customers had lost money
because of the alleged conspiracy and bribes in the indictment made
public Thursday.
   In a telephone interview from Gulfport, Havens said he couldn't
comment on the indictment because he hadn't seen it. However, he
said he'd done nothing illegal and he had repaid Ward for the loan.
   Snyder's attorney, Thomas Royals, said his client denies
receiving $16,000 from Little and will remain in office. Snyder
didn't attend the news conference.
   ``All we're going to say at this time is that he was offered a
campaign contribution in that amount, which he refused,'' Royals
said, adding that Snyder never told MP&L officials they must settle
the lawsuit or he wouldn't approve the rate hike.
   Little's wife, Helen Little, would only say he was out of town
Thursday and she didn't expect him to return before Saturday. Ward's
secretary in Dallas said he planned to issue a statement Friday.
   U.S. Attorney George Phillips said the indictment follows a
two-year investigation initiated by the FBI. No arraignments had
been scheduled, but Phillips said he expected court appearances
Friday in Jackson.
   Phillips and Attorney General Mike Moore said the investigation
is continuing and they expect more charges to be filed.
   The indictment alleges the conspiracy took place when MP&L had a
major pending rate increase before the Public Service Commission to
pay for its share of the Grand Gulf nuclear power plant in Port
Gibson.
   The indictment notes that on Sept. 16, 1985, the Public Service
Commission entered its order allowing a 14.7 percent projected rate
increase over the first year, or about $68 million.
   The indictment said Ward in July 1985 met with an officer of
United Energy Resources, United Gas' parent company, and offered to
help settle the lawsuit in return for the pipeline company buying
Texas his properties for $20 million.
   James Tramuto, United Gas Pipeline's vice president for
government affairs, said in a telephone interview that his company
had cooperated with the FBI investigation and that Ward had been
retained to help reach a settlement.
   Tramunto said he knew of no Ward properties the company had
bought, and he added that United Gas has had several owners since
the settlement was reached and could not comment on the indictments.
   ``We had no knowledge of any illegal activity'' at the time the
lawsuit was settled, MP&L spokesman Jim Moore said. He would not say
whether any public service commissioner ever told the utility its
rate increase wouldn't be approved unless it settled the lawsuit
against United Gas Pipeline.

   An invasion of arctic air, moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and
an upper-level storm system over Arizona combined to produce
near-blizzard conditions over parts of New Mexico and west Texas
Thursday.
   Up to 8 inches of snow was expected in New Mexico through the
evening. In the South Plains of western Texas, 25- to 35-mph winds
whipped up drifting snow, reducing visibility to near zero.
   In Texas, snow was found as far south as Wink and the southwest
mountains and sleet was reported between Midland and San Angelo.
Strong winds were expected to produce wind chill readings of 5 to 10
degrees below zero.
   A winter storm watch was posted for the night for New Mexico's
south-central and southwestern mountains and the southeastern Plains.
   Rain, heavy at times, extended across much of central and eastern
Texas. Victoria, north of Corpus Christi, got nearly 2 inches of
rain in six hours.
   Rain also fell over parts of the lower Mississippi Valley. Light
snow fell across northern Arkansas, and a snow advisory was posted
for north-central and northwestern Arkansas through the night.
   Light snow also fell across parts of the northern and central
Rocky Mountain region, the northern Plains and the northern Great
Lakes.
   Rainshowers were scattered from northern Florida and the central
Gulf Coast through the Tennessee Valley to the lower Great Lakes and
over western Washington state.
   Heavier snowfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 1 p.m.
EST included 4 inches at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., and 3 inches at
Lubbock, Texas.
   High winds buffeted the southwestern United States during the
morning. Gusts to 58 mph were clocked at Ontario, Calif. High wind
warnings were in effect through the night for gusts up to 65 mph in
Southern California's mountains, the Mojave area, and Orange and San
Diego counties.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 4
degrees at Thief River Falls, Minn., to 83 degrees at Fort Myers,
Fla. The morning low for the nation was 9 below at Jackson and
Laramie, Wyo.
   Friday's forecast called for continued snow in southern New
Mexico and southwest Texas as well as the central Appalachians
through much of New England and the Great Lakes region. Rainshowers
were predicted for much of the rest of the area from southeastern
Arizona through the lower Mississippi Valley to the southern and
middle Atlantic Coast. Scattered showers should dot northern
Washington state, with scattered snowshowers over the northern
Plains and fog over western Oregon and central California. Fair to
partly sunny skies should prevail elsewhere.
   High temperatures should remain freezing from eastern Montana
through the upper half of the Mississippi Valley to New England,
with highs in the teens from eastern North Dakota and eastern South
Dakota to upper Michigan and northern lower Michigan, and across
northern Maine. Temperatures should rise above 50 degrees along the
northern Pacific Coast, from the California Coast to southern
Arizona, across the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and from the
central Gulf Coast to the southern Atlantic Coast. Highs should
range in the 60s from California's central coast to southwestern
Arizona, and in southern Georgia and northern Florida. Highs in the
70s should be the rule for coastal Southern California and the
Florida Peninsula.

   Here are a few facts about the locusts that two U.S. AID planes,
which were attacked Thursday over Mauritania, were sent to combat.
   
   WHAT THEY ARE _ Locusts are migratory grasshoppers with 3-inch
legs. They travel in hordes, stripping vast areas of vegetation.
   
   WHERE THEY ARE _ North Africa is now suffering its worst locust
infestation in 30 years. The insects were born on winds from the
Sahara Desert. However, winds also have blown them to other
continents. They have appeared in southern England and in 12
Caribbean nations, blown westward across the Atlantic Ocean by
tropical storms.
   
   THE THREAT _ Because they ravage vegetation, locusts pose a great
threat to food supplies. In North Africa, the locusts are striking
areas already suffering from severe drought.

   Andrei Sakharov, wrapping up his first visit to the
United States Thursday, said Mikhail Gorbachev's speech to the
United Nations should strengthen the general secretary's position in
the Soviet Union.
   However, the 67-year-old physicist and Nobel Peace laureate
warned that Gorbachev's political restructuring known as perestroika
``cannot yet be called irreversible.''
   Sakharov also called for an international effort to aid victims
of the massive earthquake that hit Soviet Armenia on Wednesday. Tens
of thousands of people are believed dead.
   With his stepdaughter as an interpreter, the dissident said the
United States has vast experience with disaster relief and expressed
hope that Soviet authorities would allow international volunteers
into the stricken areas.
   Since arriving in the United States Nov. 4, Sakharov has visited
with relatives, undergone medical testing, promoted a new
international organization and met with President Reagan in
Washington.
   He boarded a 6:40 p.m. flight from Logan International Airport
for Paris, where he plans to attend a celebration of the 40th
anniversary of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. He said he may meet in Paris with Polish Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa.
   In his well-received speech to the United Nations Wednesday,
Gorbachev offered to cut the Red Army by 10 percent and withdraw
50,000 Soviet troops from Eastern Europe.
   Sakharov said, ``I believe that Gorbachev has taken a very
important initiative and that this will broaden international
support for him and therefore strengthen his position in the Soviet
Union.''
   However, Sakharov repeated a sentiment often voiced during his
trip _ that Gorbachev's plan of political and economic restructuring
faces some serious obstacles.
   ``I believe that the process of perestroika is now in a very
critical phase,'' he said. ``There are a whole spectrum of serious
problems. The economic restructuring is especially complex. My
country is in a stage of searching for solutions, and this period
could last a long time.''
   Sakharov, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights
activities, was exiled to the closed industrial city of Gorky in
January 1980 for his criticism of the Soviet military intervention
in Afghanistan. He was released in December 1986.
   He received a visa to visit the United States as a member of the
Soviet delegation to the International Foundation for the Survival
and Development of Humanity, a non-profit organization that plans to
sponsor research on global problems such as hunger, arms control,
pollution and energy conservation.
   Sakharov came to the United States without his wife, Yelena
Bonner, who remained in Moscow. He spent much of his time visiting
her daughter and son-in-law in the Boston suburb of Newton.
   Asked whether he would like to live in the United States,
Sakharov said no.
   ``I think that my fate is completely bound up with the country
where I was born and I want to live there,'' he said.

   The founder of a fundamentalist
Christian college said Thursday he will appeal the state's decision
to bar his school from granting master's degrees in science as
motivated by an anti-creationist bias.
   Dr. Henry Morris, president of the private, San Diego-based
Institute for Creation Research, said the college has granted
graduate degrees in science for seven years and never had a problem
with state education authorities.
   He said he will file an appeal with the Council on Private
Postsecondary Institutions, the 15-member state panel reviewing the
decision next month.
   ``At that point,'' Morris said, ``we will decide whether to take
it to the courts or not.''
   California schools superintendent Bill Honig announced Wednesday
that the state Education Department's licensing agency ordered the
institute to stop offering master's degrees in science, declaring
that the classes offer students religious dogma instead of
scientific theory.
   A report of the agency's decision, which received little
attention when it was made last week, was carried in Thursday's
editions of the New York Times.
   Since 1981, 12 students have obtained master of science degrees
at the college, and about ``30 to 40'' are currently pursuing
similar graduate studies, Morris said. ``We are a very small
operation,'' he added.
   ``Everybody's agreed that they have the right to teach the course
_ they agree to that and we agree to that. They say they want to
issue a degree in science, but they say creationism is science. We
don't,'' Honig said.
   ``The question here is whether we let them call it science or
not,'' he added. ``I assume it (the curriculum) is good creationism,
but can you say that a person there has a degree in physics or
geology?
   ``When you believe the world is 6,000 years old, it's pretty
tough to get a degree in geology.''
   In a related development Thursday, the Policy and Planning
Committee of the state Board of Education postponed action on
proposed ``anti-dogmatism'' guidelines for science teaching.
   ``The guidelines make a distinction between theory and belief and
fact, and they get into definitions as they relate to the teaching
of the origins of life,'' said Susan Lange, a spokeswoman for Honig.
   The goal of the guidelines, she added, is to ensure that ``dogma
is not presented as fact or scientific evidence.'' The board is
expected to consider the issue again next month.
   At issue in the degree dispute, Honig and Morris said, is the
philosophical gap between those who accept the biblical version of
the divine creation of the earth, and those who contend that life
evolved over millions of years.
   The state's decision stemmed from an inspection of the college in
August by a state panel of five scientists who decided, after
consulting with Honig, that religious theory was being taught, not
science.
   Honig has the authority to affirm or reject the decision of the
Council on Private Postseconday Institutions on Morris' appeal. If
rejected, Morris can appeal to an administrative law judge, then
appeal through the court system.
   State rejection of the master's of science degree means that
graduates cannot claim in applications for jobs, financial
assistance or other colleges, that they have completed a science
curriculum.
   It also means that the course would not satisfy state
professional credentialing requirements _ for example, for a
teacher's credential, Honig said.
   Major colleges and universities in California are accredited
through recognized national or regional academic-standards groups.
Smaller schools, such as technical or business colleges, require
approval from the state school superintendent to grant degrees.
   In 1986, the Legislature and governor tightened the state's
credentialing laws, requiring numerous small schools, including the
Institute for Creation Research to apply to the state for permission
to grant degrees.

   President Reagan said Thursday night the
hardest part of his job has been to send young Americans into
combat, and the thing he ``enjoyed the most'' was the economic
recovery.
   ``I think there have been many tough things,'' the president said
when asked at what may have been his final news conference to
describe what had made him feel good and what had made him feel
badly.
   ``I don't think there's anything tougher than to have to order
these magnificent young men and women in our military today ... into
danger, to order them to go someplace where their lives are
threatened and their lives are taken,'' he said. ``That's got to be
something that any president would hesitate on and have to say was
the greatest burden.''
   In response to another question asked later in the 33-minute,
nationally broadcast news conference, Reagan added that the taking
and holding of Americans as hostages in Lebanon was one of the
heaviest burdens he has borne.
   ``It is ... again one of those things ... that you go to bed with
every night,'' he said when asked about prospects for winning the
release of nine Americans held by pro-Iranian elements in Lebanon.
   During Reagan's presidency, more than 200 U.S. military personnel
were killed during a bombing of a Marine barracks in Beirut,
Lebanon, 19 servicemen were killed when several thousand troops were
sent into combat during the invasion of Grenada, and 37 crewmen
aboard the USS Stark were killed when their ship was struck by
missiles fired by an Iraqi fighter while it was patrolling the
Persian Gulf.
   When asked what he most enjoyed about the presidency, Reagan
replied that ``there are a number of things to miss.''
   But Reagan said ``let me simply say one I enjoyed the most is the
economic recovery.''
   ``When I came here, for almost half a century, the debate on the
(Capitol) Hill in the Congress had always been between more big
spending programs, more power for the federal government, more
intervention in private affairs by the federal government, as
against those who were preaching less,'' he said.
   ``We were in a disastrous situation when we came here,'' Reagan
said.

   Questions on U.S.-Soviet relations dominated
President Reagan's nationally broadcast news conference on Thursday
and he voiced both admiration and respect for Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev a day after their final meeting as leaders.
   Reagan's first complimentary mention of his Soviet counterpart
came in his opening statement as he characterized Gorbachev's hasty
return home, prompted by the devastating earthquake in Armenia, as
``a sad final note to what has been an otherwise successful _ and I
use the next words advisedly _ happy and historic visit to the
United States.''
   The president also mentioned that he had given Gorbachev an
inscribed photo of the walk they had taken together in Geneva in
1985. Reagan said he and his wife, Nancy, ``were delighted'' the
Gorbachevs had invited them to Moscow and that he hoped the
Gorbachevs could come visit them in California.
   Reminded of his earlier stern criticism of Soviet leaders and the
Soviet system, Reagan said there were differences in recent Soviet
leaders, ``but, I must say, I have never met with one of those
leaders that was comparable to this man or had the approach that he
has.''
   Still, Reagan added, ``He knows that I feel that _ well, we put
it this way, as I've said, my philosophy is, trust everybody, but
cut the cards.''
   Asked if he trusted Gorbachev fully, Reagan said:
   ``He hasn't shown me any reason yet that I shouldn't. But, again,
as I've said, that's why I kept referring to ``doveryai, no
proveryai,'' trust but verify, and he knows that.''
   Asked to assess Gorbachev's long-term chances for political
survival, Reagan said: ``Well, I realize, and I think we all should,
that he is battling a bureaucracy, because whether it's a Russian
bureaucracy or one of our own, the first rule of bureaucracy is
protect the bureaucracy.''
   ``And it would mean some great changes for some of the
``Nomenklatura,'' as they call their bureaucracy there, if he
institutes the reforms that he's talking about.
   ``But, on the plus side for him, it's very evident that the
people of the Soviet Union are on his side,'' Reagan continued.
``And I have to believe that the Nomenklatura is going to have to
think twice with regard to how far they would go in trying to block
him when the man in the street over there wants the things that have
been seen.''

<HEAD>Defense Suggests Ms. Nussbaum Was Jealous of Lisa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for a man charged with fatally beating
his 6-year-old illegally adopted daughter suggested Thursday that
his client's live-in companion was jealous of his relationship with
the girl.
   Hedda Nussbaum, who lived with defendant Joel Steinberg for 12
years, could have had a motive to hurt the little girl, Steinberg's
attorney Ira London implied.
   Last week, WABC-TV quoted a psychiatric report that stated that
Ms. Nussbaum, who has testified that Steinberg frequently beat her,
had feelings of ``rivalry'' with Lisa Steinberg.
   Ms. Nussbaum, the key prosecution witness at Steinberg's murder
trial, denied she was jealous of Lisa but admitted that Steinberg
often would take the child out on social occasions and leave her
home.
   ``I wished that I could go, too,'' Ms. Nussbaum told London
during her third day of cross-examination. ``I was not happy that I
could not go.''
   During a break in the questioning, Ms. Nussbaum's lawyer, Barry
Scheck, said, ``London's trying to show she didn't care about the
child. It's just not true, so it's not happening.''
   ``Did it become more frequent in 1987 that Joel took Lisa and
left you at home?'' London asked Ms. Nussbaum.
   ``In '86 and '87,'' she answered, and offered a reason: ``At that
time Joel did not want me to be showing myself to new people who
didn't know me because I didn't look too terrific.''
   Steinberg, 47, is accused of murder for allegedly beating Lisa to
death. He denies that he hit the girl; Ms. Nussbaum has testified
that he did.
   The first-grader was removed unconscious from Steinberg's
Greenwich Village apartment on Nov. 2, 1987. She died of head
injuries three days later.
   The death of the little girl in an affluent, well-educated
household _ Steinberg was an attorney, now disbarred, and Ms.
Nussbaum was a children's book editor _ shocked the city and led to
a re-examination of responsibilities of neighbors, teachers and
social workers to recognize and report suspected child abuse.
   Steinberg obtained Lisa shortly after her birth from an unwed
Long Island teen-ager, telling the mother the baby would be placed
with a Catholic family in Manhattan. The mother, Michelle Launders,
paid Steinberg $500 for ``filing fees.''
   Ms. Launders, 27, has watched the seven-week trial daily from a
front-row seat. She said she was angry that Ms. Nussbaum had not
prepared her home for the baby after Ms. Nussbaum testified she and
Steinberg had planned to keep the infant even before she was born.
   Ms. Nussbaum, who said she was unable to conceive, testified that
it was a complete surprise to her when they got a second child, a
boy born to another unwed teen-ager. ``Joel always said he wanted a
son,'' she said.
   The boy, named Mitchell, was 16 months old when Lisa died. He has
since been returned to his natural mother.
   London asked Ms. Nussbaum whether she had ever told a
psychiatrist Mitchell was her favorite of the two children. She
denied she had said that.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Thursday used what was
probably his last formal news conference to straighten out one of
the most familiar quotations from his first. The quotation, he said,
is actually a misquotation.
   The president was asked if, after his warm meeting with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in New York on Wednesday, he still
believes the Soviets would lie, cheat and steal to achieve their
political goals.
   ``Do you think he has really change, to what extent has he
changed and how have you changed?'' was the question.
   ``I know so many of you quoted this in that first press
conference of mine,'' said Reagan. ``But none of you ever thought to
give the complete answer.
   ``I said, `in their own words,' this was their philosophy and it
was in writing that there was no crime, all of these things were not
a crime if they advanced the cause of socialism,'' Reagan added.
   ``Now I didn't make that up. That's what they said. I think
there's been a change. That was four leaders back before this one.''
   Well, he's right.
   In his news conference of Jan. 29, 1981, Reagan was asked what he
saw as the Soviets' long term intentions.
   ``I don't have to think of an answer as to what I think their
intentions are; they have repeated it,'' the then-new president
replied. ``I know of no leader of the Soviet Union since the
revolution ... that has not more than once repeated in the various
Communist congresses they hold their determination that their goal
must be the promotion of world revolution ...
   ``Now, as long as they do that and as long as they, at the same
time, have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they
recognize is what will further their cause, meaning they reserve
unto themselves the right to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat, in
order to attain that, and that is moral, not immoral, and we operate
on a different set of standards, I think when you do business with
them, even at a detente, you keep that in mind.''

<HEAD>IRS Says Louisiana Congressman Owes $76,000 in Payroll Taxes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service has filed a
lien against Rep. Clyde Holloway, R-La., claiming he owes more than
$76,000 in payroll taxes from his central Louisiana nursery.
   Holloway, contacted Thursday in Opelousas, said he didn't have
his files with him but expressed the belief that ``probably
sixty-some-odd thousand'' dollars was paid after the lien was filed
Tuesday in state District Court here.
   He said he hoped to have the balance paid by Friday.
   In its claim, the IRS maintained that Holloway, owner of
Holloway's Nursery in nearby Forest Hill, was delinquent in paying
$76,088.69 in payroll taxes from June 30, 1987, through June 30,
1988.
   Payroll taxes include money employers are required to pay the
government for such things as Social Security benefits for their
employees, the IRS said.
   Henry Holmes, an IRS spokesman in New Orleans, said the lien was
a standard procedure aimed at protecting ``the interest of the
government. Our emphasis in this case is to work with the taxpayer
to resolve it.''
   Holloway blamed Louisiana's depressed oil economy for the
delinquency, as well as his preoccupation with last fall's
re-election campaign in Louisiana's large, meandering 8th
Congressional District.
   Asked if his business is in financial trouble, Holloway replied:
``I'm sure my being gone doesn't help it any.''

Murders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The third woman identified Thursday
among five murdered bodies found in southeastern Massachusetts was a
drug addict with ties to a seedy section of this fishing port, the
victim's mother said.
   As the search for more bodies continued, investigators identified
Debra Medeiros, 30, of Fall River as the first of five female bodies
found at wooded roadsides between July and December in the towns of
Dartmouth and Freetown.
   Investigators believe she was strangled, said Thomas Gibney, a
spokesman for Bristol County District Attorney Ronald Pina. She was
reported missing by her family in Fall River on May 27. Her
partially clad body was found July 3.
   Investigators have yet to establish the identities of two of the
victims. The three identified to date all had ties to the Weld
Square district, known for the availability of drugs and
prostitutes, in this city of 98,000 people.
   Gibney said authorities still have suspects not in custody and
were leaning toward the notion that the killer is from the New
Bedford area, not a traveling murderer who might be responsible for
killings in other parts of the country.
   Gibney also said investigators were checking reports that a man
claiming to be the highway killer assaulted a 22-year-old woman in a
pickup truck in Rhode Island Thursday morning.
   The woman reportedly told police that she escaped from the truck
at 1:30 a.m. on Interstate 95 in Warwick, R.I.
   Medeiros' mother, Olivia, said her daughter, who lived at home
all her life, was a drug addict. Gibney also said Medeiros had been
addicted to drugs. Fall River Police Lt. Brian Lynch said only that
she was ``known to police.''
   Mrs. Medeiros said she last saw her daughter in May when she left
to visit her boyfriend in New Bedford. The couple was to go on a
cruise when, several days later, she said she got a call from the
boyfriend asking where Debra was.
   Mrs. Medeiros said the boyfriend, Russell Oliveira, told her that
they had had a fight on the night of May 27. Oliveira has an
unlisted telephone number and could not be reached for comment
Thursday.
   Gibney would not comment on the details of Medeiros'
disappearance, but, according to Mrs. Medeiros, Oliveira is not a
suspect.
   Medeiros' body was discovered in a wooded area off Route 140 in
Freetown. Gibney attributed the five-month delay in identifying her
to the early emphasis on a list of six missing persons from New
Bedford.
   Two of those missing persons have turned out to have been among
the bodies found by police.
   Using dental records, authorities identified one of the victims
Wednesday as Nancy Paiva, 36, of New Bedford. Her body was
discovered July 30 along Interstate 195 in the town of Dartmouth.
   Paiva left two daughters aged 14 and 17. Gibney said she had no
record of arrest for prostitution but was known to have a drug
problem. The other identified victim is Dawn Mendes, 25, who was
reported missing in September.
   Investigators suspect one person may be responsible for the
deaths because the bodies were found in a 6- to 8-mile radius in
dense woods within 25 feet of Interstate 195 and Route 140.
   A state police dog from Connecticut knwon for an ability to find
bodies returned to his home state Thursday, Gibney said. A trained
police dog from Massachusetts, continued hunting along Route 140
outside New Bedford.
   Dr. Douglas Ubelaker, a forensic anthropologist with the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, is scheduled to arrive Monday
to examine the remains of the three unidentified bodies, which are
largely decomposed.

   Gorbachev interrupted his trip a day after addressing the United
Nations in New York and holding a summit meeting with President
Reagan and President-elect George Bush.
   He had been scheduled to leave New York on Friday for Cuba, and
then travel to Britain.
   But Shevardnadze announced in New York that Gorbachev instead
would be heading home to lead the rescue and clean-up operations
following the Wednesday earthquake.
   Shevardnadze said thousands of people had died, but Soviet
officials have given no figures.
   Unofficial reports have said the toll is in the tens of thousands.
   Armenian journalists said a Communist Party Politburo commission
headed by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov was told at a meeting in
Yerevan on Thursday that the toll could approach 50,000.

   Soviet authorities rushed military surgeons and
tons of medical supplies Thursday into Armenia, rocked by an
earthquake that officials said devastated several cities and killed
tens of thousands of people.
   Armenian journalists said a Politburo commission led by Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov received preliminary estimates that up to 50,000
people died in the Wednesday earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the
Richter scale. Soviet officials reported thousands of people were
killed but provided no death toll.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cut short his trip to the United
States and flew home to lead a worldwide emergency rescue effort in
southern republic, which has a population of 3.3 million.
   ``Urgent measures are being taken to help all those affected by
this terrible tragedy, and I have to be there in this effort,''
Gorbachev said before leaving New York. He canceled trips to Cuba
and Britain.
   The Soviet news agency Tass announced Gorbachev's arrival in
Moscow early Friday. It did not say whether he would stay or fly
immediately to Yerevan, the capital of the small Soviet republic in
the Caucasus Mountains.
   President Reagan offered emergency humanitarian aid, Cuban
President Fidel Castro pledged to send construction workers, and
Britain dispatched London firefighters to join the rescue effort.
   The epicenter of the quake was 25 miles northeast of Leninaken,
on the Turkish border. The U.S. Geological Survey said the initial
shock was followed four minutes later by an aftershock measuring 5.8
on the Richter scale.
   Soviet TV showed a clock on a building in Leninakan, Armenia's
second-largest city, stopped at 11:41 a.m. (2:41 a.m. EST) _ the
instant the disaster struck.
   The earthquake destroyed two-thirds of Leninakan, which has a
population of 250,000, a TV correspondent said.
   Spitak, a town of 16,000 about 45 miles away, ``was practically
erased from the face of the Earth,'' the correspondent said.
   Hundreds of thousands were left homeless in the region, he said.
   Tass said half the buildings in Kirovakan, a city of 150,000, had
crumbled.
   A special meeting of representatives of all 15 Soviet republics
was called in Yerevan on Friday to discuss disaster relief.
   Soviet authorities dispatched doctors, engineers and food and
medical supplies to the area, and a ``helicopter bridge'' was set up
to ferry the injured northward to hospitals in neighboring Soviet
Georgia, the Tass news agency reported.
   Tass said 2,300 people were hospitalized in Yerevan with injuries
from the quake and that 200 were hospitalized across the border in
Georgia. It did not say how many of the injured were treated
elsewhere.
   For a second night Thursday, millions of Soviet TV viewers saw
soldiers searching for survivors and bodies in huge piles of
concrete rubble, by hand or with cranes. The disaster coverage by
the state-run media was unprecedented in its speed and scope.
   Ryzhkov, head of an earthquake commission, told Soviet television
the main task before authorities is to search for the injured and
dead.
   He then turned directly toward the camera and made an unusual
appeal to factory and business officials nationwide not to wait to
be asked, but to start immediately sending heavy cranes, helicopters
and other equipment.
   Friday and Saturday were declared days of mourning in Armenia.
   Tass quoted Nikolai Shebalin, a laboratory director at the Soviet
Institute of Earth Science, as saying more earthquakes were likely
in the region, but they should be weaker. Less powerful aftershocks
normally follow a strong earthquake.
   Soviet TV and the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported from
Leninakan that preliminary estimates were that tens of thousands of
people were killed.
   Foreign Minister spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said authorities were
having difficulty calculating a death toll because communications
with the region were severed.
   He said the Foreign Ministry was reviewing requests by foreign
reporters to visit the disaster area, but that none had been
approved.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said soldiers were working under spotlights
in the wreckage of a Leninakan school. It said two sergeants pulled
the bodies of more than 50 children from the ruins and that only a
few children had been found alive in the collapsed building.
   Blood donations were being collected throughout the Soviet Union
for quake victims. Tons of blankets, field kitchens, tents and
medicine were pouring into the region, Tass said.
   Soldiers were setting up tent cities to house evacuees in the
devastated regions, and restoring electricity and water supplies,
army Gen. Vladimir Arkhipov told Tass. Bonfires burned in the
shattered cities to warm the homeless in the December chill.
   The newspaper Izvestia reported the population of Armenia has
swelled in recent weeks as settlers fled violent ethnic strife
between Armenians, who are mostly Christian, and predominantly
Moslem Azerbaijanis.
   About 180,000 refugees reportedly have fled across the border
between the two republics in the last three weeks.
   The last earthquake in the Soviet Union with a death toll in the
thousands was on Oct. 5, 1948, in Ashkhabad, the capital of
Turkmenia. The Soviet press _ acting under Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or greater openness _ recently gave the death toll for the
Ashkhabad quake as 110,000.
   A quake of 6.9 on the Richter scale is capable of causing
widespread damage. The scale is a measure of ground motion as
recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a
tenfold increase in magnitude.

   Honduras said Thursday it is
investigating whether a Nicaraguan helicopter pilot was spying when
Honduran authorities intercepted his Soviet-made helicopter gunship.
   His mission ``could well have been espionage,'' Foreign Minister
Carlos Lopez said in messages to the United Nations and the
Organization of American States.
   Earlier Thursday, Lopez said Honduras has not decided whether to
grant political asylum to pilot Edwin Rafael Estrada Leiva, who
landed his helicopter Wednesday at a Honduran air base.
   The Nicaraguan government said an army defector flew the
helicopter across the border and described him as a ``CIA
terrorist.''
   Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Ecoto Brockmann said in a
protest note to Honduras on Wednesday that the helicopter incident
might be linked to a U.S. plan to invade Nicaragua.
   The Honduran armed forces said it intercepted Estrada in Honduras
air space on Wednesday and made him land his Soviet-made MI-25
helicopter at an air base near the capital.
   Nicaragua immediately demanded the return of the helicopter and
pilot. It also accused Honduras of kidnapping the pilot.
   The United States funds the war of the Contra rebels against
Nicaragua's leftist government, and the Soviet bloc arms Nicaragua.
Honduras has allowed the Contras to maintain bases on its territory,
and the United States also maintains a military presence there.
   Both Honduras and Nicaragua have accused each other of border
incursions, and tension remains high despite a truce in Nicaragua's
civil war.

   Two unemployed aerospace workers described by
acquaintances as ``oddballs, misfits'' have been charged with
attempted extortion in computerized death threats to prominent
Antelope Valley residents.
   Roman Stephan Makuch, 27, and Richard Mathew Faroni, 26, who were
arrested in Las Vegas on Thanksgiving Day, were being returned
Thursday to the community of Lancaster, said Deputy District
Attorney Steve Cooley.
   Although the two are suspected of sending 265 computer-produced
threats, they were charged with only 10 specific acts to simplify
the case, Cooley said.
   Cooley said the recipients were all ``substantial people''
including a former Lancaster city manager, bank vice presidents and
professionals in the Antelope Valley, the rapidly expanding suburbs
60 miles north of downtown L.A. on the southern rim of the Mojave
Desert.
   Cooley said many of the letters were nearly identical but that
the text of each was ``customized'' to include personal information
about the recipient.
   The letters, attached to the complaint, began with an obscenity
and a threat of death. The writers then demanded specific amounts of
cash as high as $600,000 with instructions for its delivery. They
went on to give gruesome details of how victims would be killed and
threatened harm to their children, spouses and relatives.
   ``These victims did not take it as a joke,'' said Cooley. Some
fled the Antelope Valley and stayed in hotels while others installed
security systems after recieving the letters on Nov. 2 and Nov. 3,
he said.
   ``There were two people hospitalized as the result of their fear
and concern,'' he said.
   No one paid any money, and all recipients who did not discard the
letters as junk mail contacted authorities.
   Cooley said it appeared that the letter writers had researched
their targets, including in some letters specific information about
the recipients' business relationships and homes. One letter
referred to the satellite dish on a resident's house and threatened
to ``fertilize your fruit trees with your decaying ... body.''
   ``We can put toxic chemicals in your toothpaste or glue laced
with poison cyanide on envelopes and stamps that you lick,'' the
letters said. Many contained the phrase, ``The organization has
watched this area over a year and we know what you can pay.''
   Makuch and Faroni waived extradition from Las Vegas. Cooley said
a search of their apartment and a nearby storage facility turned up
a computer, printers and computer discs, a handgun and several CB
radios.
   The letters had told some recipients to bring a CB radio to Las
Vegas and tune in a specific channel for instructions on where to
deliver money.
   The prosecutor said the men were unemployed but both had
previously worked on an assembly line at Rockwell International's
Palmdale plant on the B-1B bomber project.
   He said acquaintances who spoke to local news media about them
said, ``They could be characterized as being a couple of oddballs,
misfits.''
   Cooley said other people may be involved and the investigation
was continuing.
   Both men were charged with conspiracy to commit extortion,
attempted extortion and sending threatening letters for extortion
purposes. If convicted, they could draw maximum sentences of six
years in prison.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev returned to
Moscow early Friday, cutting short his trip to the United States,
Cuba and Britain after an earthquake leveled cities and killed
thousands of people in northern Armenia.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass announced Gorbachev's return
in a brief statement that did not say whether he would stay in
Moscow or immediately fly to Yerevan, Armenia's capital.
   Gorbachev's return also was reported as the first item on the
morning television program ``120 Minutes.''
   Tass said, ``interrupting his trip abroad ... Gorbachev returned
from New York to Moscow.''
   It said he was accompanied by Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, a native of the Georgian republic just north of the
stricken area; Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, and Deputy
Premier Vladimir Kamentsev.
   Gorbachev interrupted his trip a day after addressing the United
Nations in New York and holding a summit meeting with President
Reagan and President-elect George Bush.
   He had been scheduled to leave New York on Friday for Cuba, and
then travel to Britain.
   But Shevardnadze announced in New York that Gorbachev instead
would be heading home to lead the rescue and clean-up operations
following the Wednesday earthquake.
   Shevardnadze said thousands of people had died, but Soviet

   Unofficial reports have said the toll is in the tens of thousands.
   Armenian journalists said a Communist Party Politburo commission

   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, implicated in a
stock scandal that has damaged the governing party, resigned Friday
to help clear opposition to passage of tax reform bills in
parliament.
   Miyazawa said an aide's involvement in buying unlisted shares of
a real estate company had led him to make ``inaccurate'' statements
to lawmakers. He said he was resigning to take responsibility and
hoped the move would speed passage of the tax legislation.
   ``Personally, I hope the tax reform bills will be passed soon,
and it doesn't matter what happens to me,'' he said during an
interview on national television.
   Miyazawa told reporters Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita approved
of his resignation. Japan's Kyodo News Service, quoting unidentified
sources, said Takeshita will temporarily serve as finance minister
until a replacement is found for Miyazawa.
   Opposition parties had demanded that Miyazawa resign to take
responsibility for repeatedly giving conflicting accounts about his
role in the stock trading controversy. They refused to resume
parliamentary debate on the tax reform package until he did so.
   Miyazawa, a two-term finance minister and veteran politician,
changed accounts of his involvement in the stock deals at least
three times in his statements to parliamentary committees
investigating the scandal.
   The controversy involves purchases of real estate stocks of
Recruit Cosmos Co. by dozens of leaders of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, including Miyazawa, Takeshita and former Foreign
Minister Shintaro Abe _ Japan's top three politicians.
   Political analysts have said Miyazawa's resignation probably
would pave the way for passage of the tax reform package during the
current session of the Diet, or parliament, which ends on Dec. 29.
   Miyazawa has been considered a candidate for prime minister.
   In September, when his involvement in the controversy was first
made known, he told a news conference that he took no part in the
dealings and had no knowledge about the unlisted shares of the real
estate company.
   Later, an investigation by the Japan Communist Party showed that
Miyazawa bought 10,000 unlisted shares of Recruit Cosmos in
September 1986 and earned more than $164,000 in profits by selling
them immediately after the company went public a month later.
   After that happened, he told the committee that his former aide
bought shares from his business associate without his knowledge.
   It was disclosed in a parliamentary investigation last month that
the aide, Tsuneo Hattori, bought shares directly from Recruit Inc.,
the real estate firm's parent company.
   Miyazawa told a news conference last week that he would give up
his Cabinet position and his seat in parliament, which he has held
since 1959, if he was obliged to change his testimony again. He also
hinted that he was willing to resign if it would help secure passage
of the tax reform package.
   Debate on the tax legislation has been stalled since last week,
when opposition parties singled out Miyazawa and demanded that the
finance minister submit material evidence to prove the accuracy of
his earlier statements.
   Miyazawa, however, refused to do so, saying he had lost all
evidence such as stock transaction records and receipts.
   The legislation, Japan's first major overhaul of its tax system
since the end of the World War II, has been a top priority for the
Liberal Democratic Party for a decade.
   Successive administrations have failed to enact the reform due to
public and opposition party resistance. Former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone, under whom Miyazawa also served as finance
minister, staked his political career on tax reform and lost.
   The new package simplifies corporate and personal income tax
scales and introduces a 3 percent sales tax.
   The governing party, which commands a majority in both houses of
parliament, forced the tax bill through the lower house last month.
The legislation has been debated in the upper house since then.
   The Liberal Democrats could enact the tax laws despite opposition
resistance. But this would violate Japanese political tradition,
which values consensus, and could cost the party votes in the next
election, said Masumi Ishikawa, political commentator for the
mass-circulation daily Asahi Shimbun.
   A survey by another leading daily, the Mainichi Shimbun, showed
Friday that public support for the Takeshita administration has
dropped to 18 percent from last December's 30 percent _ the
third-lowest rating for a prime minister since World War II.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev returned home Thursday from
a tragedy-shortened but triumphant visit, expressing hopes that it
would ``open up good prospects for our two peoples'' and the world.
   The Soviet leader cut short his visit by a day to oversee relief
efforts for victims of an earthquake that reportedly killed tens of
thousands of people in the southern Soviet republic of Armenia. He
also canceled planned visits to Cuba and Great Britain.
   But during his 45-hour stay, Gorbachev dazzled world leaders with
a dramatic arms reduction proposal and captured the hearts of New
Yorkers, who gathered in droves along Manhattan streets to
jubilantly cheer the Soviet leader.
   The warm feelings were not lost on Gorbachev, who said the
hospitality he experienced showed an ``increasing friendliness and
willingness to cooperate on the part of the Soviet people and the
American people.''
   ``We believe that this may have been one of the most important
things that happened on this day of our stay in America,'' Gorbachev
said before leaving Kennedy Airport. His plane departed at about
12:30 p.m. EST.
   Gorbachev explained his abrupt departure at an airport news
conference, saying the quake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale, ``had extremely grave consequences, devastation and grave
loss of life.''
   Armenian church officials in New York who are in contact with
people in the devastated area said the death toll might be as high
as 70,000.
   Though he had only ``one working day'' in New York, Gorbachev
said, ``I and my delegation believe that this was a very important
day.''
   The highlights of the visit were Gorbachev's dramatic
announcement before the United Nations General Assembly that he
planned a major reduction in Soviet troop strength over the next
three years, and his superpower luncheon with President Reagan and
President-elect George Bush.
   Gorbachev, the first Soviet chief to visit New York in 28 years,
said his speech and a nighttime reception at the U.N. gave him the
opportunity to ``set out our views ... on the world today, and on
the prospects of the world's development.''
   In his address, Gorbachev announced that within two years he
would reduce the Soviet military machine by 500,000 troops and
10,000 tanks.
   He also called for a Jan. 1 cease-fire in Afghanistan, proposed a
100-year moratorium on Third World debt and promised to prohibit
political and religious persecution in his country.
   Gorbachev called his visit on Governors Island with Reagan and
Bush ``a good meeting, held in ... an open and trusting atmosphere.''
   He said the one word he would use to characterize the meeting was
``continuity'' and said all parties walked away ``confident that our
relations will expand and improve on the basis of cooperation, on
the basis of mutual respect for each other's interests. ...
   ``The road ahead will be tough but we will go ahead, and we will
_ I believe _ be building on what has been achieved if we act as we
have been acting, and also maybe add something new,'' the Soviet
leader said.
   ``I think that would open up good prospects for our two peoples
and will be extremely important for the world as well.''
   Gorbachev arrived on Tuesday afternoon and had been scheduled to
stay until Friday morning.
   All of his scheduled stops on Thursday, including the first
Soviet trade show in the United States, Central Park and the
Metropolitan Museum, were canceled when news of the severity of the
earthquake reached Gorbachev late Wednesday.
   Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, had been scheduled to visit children at
an Upper East Side grade school and might have done some shopping.
   The early departure saved the city money in police overtime and
saved motorists a repeat of the traffic ``Gorbylock'' that developed
during the Soviet leader's 45-car motorcade tour late Wednesday.
   Cabbies, buses, unsuspecting motorists and even pedestrians were
stopped for as much as an hour while Gorbachev and his wife toured
the city from the canyons of Wall Street to the glitter of Times
Square.
   The Soviet leader and his wife got out of his limousine outside a
Broadway theater and later at Bloomingdale's to greet people
face-to-face.
   Their tour also included a dazzling twilight view of the city
from the top of the 110-story World Trade Center.
   ``I think I would be remiss in my duty if I went home without
saying how much we are grateful to New Yorkers,'' Gorbachev said
Thursday, ``for the hospitality and feelings of friendship that they
have been expressing over these days. So to all New Yorkers, our
very warm gratitude. We value that very much.''

   A U.S. Air Force warplane struck
an apartment building and exploded in flames Thursday, killing four
people, injuring more than a dozen and setting homes on fire.
   ``This looks like a war,'' said Johannes Rau, governor of North
Rhine-Westphalia state, after touring the site of the crash.
   Another official said the pilot and three people on the ground
were killed.
   After the initial explosion, ammunition carried on the A-10 plane
continued to explode periodically, hampering rescue efforts in the
central West German town, one rescuer said.
   The U.S. Air Force suspended all tactical training flights in
Europe until Tuesday. West German authorities asked the U.S. to halt
low-level training missions until Christmas. Opposition political
parties demanded a ban on low-level flights and sharp cuts in air
exercises.
   In Arizona, another Air Force A-10 fighter crashed Thursday near
the Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation, 80 miles west of Tucson. The
pilot, who was alone in the plane, ejected safely, according to Air
Force spokeswoman Carol Ann Keck.
   In Washington, Air Force spokesman Maj. Mark Martens, said
``There is no information indicating a correlation between the two
(crashes), and there are no plans to ground the aircraft.''
   Late Thursday, firefighter Ulrich Schnell said a woman's voice
was heard from one of the destroyed houses in Remscheid, 15 miles
east of Duesseldorf in a densely populated industrial area.
   ``Rescuers tried to get to the person but without success,'' he
said, adding that rescue workers have been unable to enter some of
the houses because of the fires and dangerous ammunition spewed by
the crashing jet.
   Schnell said rescue workers no longer were hearing the voice, but
it was not known if the woman was dead.
   The A-10 Thunderbolt II jet, designed to support ground forces
and combat tanks, was carrying 1,000 rounds of 30mm training
ammunition when it crashed, said U.S. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col.
Ed Neunherz.
   In West Germany, witnesses said the plane flew low over a school
and hit the top floor of an apartment building about 1:30 p.m. (7:30
a.m. EDT).
   ``My daughters were coming home from school. I heard a tremendous
blast and rushed out to find them,'' said Wolfgang Guenther, who
lives about 800 yards from the apartment building.
   He said his teen-age daughters ``told me ... they could even see
the pilot in the plane.''
   ``The plane rammed into a building that was right in front of
them. They are home now and they are in shock,'' he said. The high
school, about 1,300 yards away from the crash site, was not damaged.
   There were conflicting reports on the number of dead and injured.
   Police and military officials at the scene earlier told reporters
six people were confirmed dead and that 40 to 50 were injured.
   But Volker Acksteiner, leader of the rescue teams, said late
Thursday night: ``There were four bodies. And we suppose that more
dead and injured are lying in the rubble.''
   Rescuers used dogs to look for possible victims or survivors.
   City councilman Guenther Krug also told a news conference that
four people were killed. He said 15 people were injured, including
11 in serious condition in nearby hospitals.
   ``It's a horrible mess in there,'' Acksteiner said. ``The rescue
was made difficult because ammunition kept exploding. It was highly
dangerous.''
   Krug said three buildings were destroyed, 17 others were damaged,
and six houses caught fire.
   He said the victims were the American pilot, two construction
workers and a mailman.
   The Air Force identified the dead pilot as Capt. Michael P.
Foster, 34, but did not give his hometown. A statement said he was
survived by his wife and two sons.
   Before Thursday's crash, 12 military airplane accidents this year
had claimed 95 lives in West Germany.
   Maj. Gen. Marcus A. Anderson, commander of the U.S. Third Air
Force based in Mildenhall, England, told reporters at the scene that
all tactical training flights would be suspended until Tuesday.
   West Germany's ARD television network said the plane was on its
way to a low-level training mission when it crashed.
   But U.S. Air Force Col. William Blaesing told reporters at the
scene: ``It was taking part in exercises at the time of the
accident, but this was not a low-flying practice, they were just
flying over.''
   He said the cause of the accident was being investigated.
   Peter Kurt Wuerzbach, the second-ranked official in the Defense
Ministry, said West German authorities were calling on their allies
to halt low-level training missions until Christmas.
   The area of the crash in this city of 130,000 residents was a
scene of gutted buildings, burnt-out cars and thick, black smoke
billowing from the rubble.
   Witnesses said body parts lay on the ground and the pilot's
parachute hung from a tree about 30 yards away.
   State prosecutor Joerg Bachmann, who is investigating the crash
for West German authorities, said witnesses saw one of the plane's
two engines on fire shortly before impact.
   A statement by the Air Force said the plane was assigned to the
81st Tactical Fighter Wing at the Royal Air Force base in
Bentwaters, England. The plane was temporarily assigned to the West
German air force base at Norvenich for training, said U.S. Air Force
spokesman Doug Moore.
   Opposition to low-level military training flights over West
Germany grew in August when Italian stunt planes collided and
crashed into a crowd of spectators at an air show at the U.S. Air
Force Base in Ramstein, killing 70 people.

   A man's role in helping police arrest a
woman charged in a series of California boardinghouse murders led
him to an emotional reunion Thursday with a son he hadn't seen in
more than three decades.
   ``This is the moment I've been waiting for for the last 32
years,'' Charles Willgues Sr., 59, said after embracing Charles Jr.
at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. ``I'd always hoped, but I was about
to give it up. You know the record by Frank Sinatra, `For Once In My
Life?' That's what I'm experiencing right now.''
   Two of Willgues' daughters didn't come to the airport to avoid
publicity. He was to meet with them later.
   ``I'm just going to take this day-by-day,'' said 35-year-old
Charles Willgues Jr. of Taylor.
   Willgues' children hadn't seen their father since he left
Michigan more than three decades ago. They say they might not have
found him if he hadn't helped police find a California murder
suspect.
   Willgues Sr. met Dorothea Puente in a Los Angeles bar last month,
five days after she fled her Sacramento boarding house following the
discovery of seven bodies on the property. He tipped off authorities
and she was arrested.
   A television reporter trying to locate Willgues after Puente's
arrest visited his old apartment, where there was a letter from
Willgues' youngest daughter, Debbie Sculley. She had traced her
father to California, but didn't know he had recently moved.
   The reporter passed the letter on to Willgues and Taylor Police
helped him get in touch with his family, leading to Thursday night's
reunion.
   ``I'm a little bit excited and a little bit confused,'' the
younger Willgues said before the plane arrived. ``I mean, I haven't
seen my father in 33 years. I never really even knew him.''
   The son, who drives a tractor-trailer for a Detroit trucking
company, said he and his sister wrote the letter found by the
reporter.
   ``We said: `This is so-and-so, your long-lost son and daughter,
and we'd like to get together sometime,''' he said. ``If (the Puente
case) had never come about, we might have never gotten together.''
   The elder Willgues' 34-year-old daughter, Linda, said earlier
Thursday she was waiting for a private moment with her dad.
   ``I'm not going,'' she said of the airport trip. ``It's just too
public.''
   A woman who identified herself in a telephone interview only as
Willgues' first wife said she was not anxious to see him again.
   ``He left when the kids were babies,'' she said. ``I don't know
why the kids are so anxious to see him. I guess it's mostly
curiosity.''

<HEAD>PTL Grand Jury Reportedly Hasn't Finished Investigating Bakker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The federal grand jury that charged
defrocked PTL founder Jim Bakker with bilking millions of dollars
from his followers has not completed its investigation, a source
familiar with the probe said Wednesday.
   ``All I can say is they haven't finished their business,'' said a
federal law enforcement officer who requested anonymity.
   The 23-member grand jury's term does not end until next month,
and the second-floor room in the federal courthouse in downtown
Charlotte is still reserved for the grand jury next week, according
to the U.S. District Court's office.
   A newspaper reported Wednesday that prosecutors and high-level
U.S. Department of Justice officials were debating whether to seek
indictments accusing Bakker and some of his former associates with
tax violations.
   The Charlotte Observer quoted a source close to the investigation
as saying: ``There's no indictment here concerning taxes. Seems to
me that would be the big one.''
   Bakker and Richard Dortch, a former senior executive vice
president at PTL, are accused of diverting more than $4 million of
PTL money to their own benefit and of conspiring to defraud the
public in raising millions of dollars to suport ``lavish and
extravagant'' lifestyles.
   The 24-count indictment issued Monday charges them with mail
fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. If convicted of all the charges,
Bakker, 48, and Dortch, 57, each could be sentenced to 120 years in
prison and fined $6 million.
   Federal prosecutors have refused comment on the investigation
since it began 17 months ago.
   U.S. Attorney Tom Ashcraft's office in Charlotte was referring
all phone calls to the U.S. Department of Justice's public affairs
office in Washington D.C.
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell said he could not
comment on the investigation.
   Bakker's attorney, Jim Toms, did not return phone calls to his
office Wednesday. Earlier, he said he didn't anticipate any more
charges against his client and said Bakker would plead innocent.
   ``I think at this point, they've produced what they intend to
produce,'' Toms said Tuesday.
   But Dortch's attorney, Bill Diehl, said he was surprised his
client was not indicted on tax charges.
   ``We expected tax indictments along with what we got indicted
for,'' he said Tuesday.
   Bakker has declined to give interviews since his indictment.
   His wife, Tammy Faye, who was not indicted, refused to talk with
reporters when she drove off the grounds of the ministry's offices
in this town just south of Charlotte Wednesday morning.
   Also Wednesday, the newest member of Bakker's defense team,
criminal law specialist Bob Davis, had his client's first court
appearance moved back to Jan. 9 from Dec. 15.
   Dortch is still scheduled to appear in court next week, along
with David Taggart, Baker's former personal aide at PTL, and his
brother, James Taggart, PTL's former interior decorator. The
Taggarts were charged in the indictment with tax evasion and
impeding the IRS in collecting taxes for allegedly diverting about
$1.1 million in PTL money to pay personal expenses.

<HEAD>Appeals Panel Upholds Decision To Set Aside Conviction of Former
Gov. Mandel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM PAUL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-judge panel of a federal appeals court
on Wednesday upheld a lower court decision to vacate the 1977
convictions of former Gov. Marvin Mandel and five others in a
political corruption case.
   U.S. Attorney Breckinridge L. Willcox said he plans to ask the
U.S. Solicitor General for permission to seek a review of the ruling
by the full 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Mandel was charged in 1975 with helping Irvin Kovens, W. Dale
Hess, Harry W. Rodgers III, William A. Rogers and Ernest Cory Sr.
get extra racing days for Marlboro Race Track, which they secretly
owned, while he was governor. He also was accused of accepting
$350,000 in gifts and financial help in a divorce settlement.
   In a 2-1 decision, the Appeals Court panel upheld a Nov. 12,
1987, decision by U.S. District Judge Frederic N. Smalkin that set
aside the mail fraud convictions of Mandel and the others. The
judges agreed with Smalkin's ruling that the jury at Mandel's trial
was allowed to consider a theory of mail fraud law that has since
been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   In June 1987, the Supreme Court ruled that federal mail fraud
statutes cannot be used to prosecute public officials for defrauding
citizens of their ``intangible rights'' to honest government.
   ``Three of the four judges that have recently looked at this case
have concluded that Gov. Mandel and the (other) defendants had been
unjustly convicted for conduct that was not criminal,'' said
Mandel's attorney, Arnold Weiner.
   Willcox contended that the ruling should not be applied to a case
that was decided 10 years earlier.
   ``Mandel's conduct then and now is a crime,'' said Willcox.
   The request for a full-court review of the panel's ruling will be
based on a dissenting opinion filed by Judge K.K. Hall, Willcox said.
   Hall wrote that ``although their trial included an erroneous jury
instruction, the proceedings were replete with evidence of bribery
and manipulation. Their (Mandel and the others) actions were and are
patently illegal.''
   Mandel was indicted on the mail fraud charges halfway through his
second four-year term. He remained in office until the day he was
sentenced and won a reversal on appeal, allowing him to resume as
governor for the last days of his term, which expired in 1979.
   Another appellate review reinstated the conviction, and Mandel
served 14 months at a federal prison camp. The appellate decision
stood until Smalkin's 1987 ruling setting aside the convictions.

   Authorities on Wednesday arrested
a man who was convicted in the Netherlands of handing over
resistance fighters to occupying Nazi forces in World War II, a news
report said.
   A Dutch court has tried the man, 78-year-old Jan Olij, in
absentia and sentenced him to 20 years in prison, according to the
Dutch Foreign Ministry in The Hague.
   He arrived in Argentina in the 1950s and worked for the national
oil company and as a policeman, according to the news agency that
report his arrest, Noticias Argentinas.
   He was being held in jail in the town of Moron about 15 miles
west of Buenos Aires pending an extradition request from the
Netherlands, the agency said.
   Last week, a federal judge approved West Germany's request for
the extradition of another man in connection with Nazi war crimes.
Josef Schwammberger is accused in the killings of at least 5,000
people, mostly Jews, at forced labor camps in occupied Poland.
   Schwammberger, 76, has appealed extradition.

   East Side, West Side, and all around the town,
Mikhail Gorbachev sampled the sights of this ``unique city,'' twice
stepping out of his limousine to the delight of cheering New Yorkers
and the dismay of his security detail.
   ``Nobody booed at all; everybody cheered,'' said Mark Johansen,
30, after the Soviet president and his wife, Raisa, emerged from
their motorcade briefly Wednesday in the middle of Broadway in
Manhattan's Theater District.
   The Gorbachevs watched dusk spread over the twinkling city from
the top of the city's tallest building, the 110-story World Trade
Center, then sped uptown to the gaudy lights of Times Square as
crowds lining the streets of cheered and applauded.
   ``The crowd was just going hysterical,'' said Joe Crawford, a
17-year-old high school student from Connecticut. ``It was really
exciting that he stopped here in front of us.''

   One hospital's solution to the runaway use of
Caesarean sections could eliminate 450,000 needless operations and
save more than $1 billion a year if adopted nationally, according to
a study published today.
   However, some experts question whether the program, developed at
Mount Sinai Medical Center in Chicago, could easily be copied at
other hospitals because doctors are too afraid of malpractice suits
to follow the proposed rules.
   Doctors at Mount Sinai reduced the Caesarean rate to half the
nationwide level by instituting five guidelines for performing them,
according to the report in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
Use of forceps deliveries also fell.
   ``To a large extent, there has been a more hands-off attitude
toward taking care of our patients,'' said Dr. Stephen A. Myers,
director of maternal-fetal medicine.

   Three decades of rock 'n' rollers and
country stars paid tribute to Roy Orbison, remembering the
black-clad balladeer as an angel-voiced original who pioneered the
early days of rock.
   ``Roy didn't copy anybody, but it cannot be said that a lot of
people didn't borrow from Orbison. And they'll tell you that _ from
the Beatles to Bruce Springsteen,'' veteran recording artist Carl
Perkins said Wednesday.
   ``He was and always will be one of the greats of rock 'n' roll,''
said former Beatle Paul McCartney.
   Orbison, who rose to fame with early 1960s hits like ``Oh, Pretty
Woman,'' ``Only the Lonely'' and ``Cryin''' and recently returned to
the charts with a group of rock legends, died of a heart attack
shortly before midnight Tuesday in a hospital in nearby
Hendersonville. He was 52.

   A sports medicine expert says ailments such as
``black heel,'' ``bikini bottom,'' ``jogger's nipples'' and ``toxic
sock syndrome'' bother athletes and fitness fans more often than
broken bones or strained muscles.
   Skin injuries such as these are among the most common of locker
room complaints, says medical professor Rodney S. W. Basler, whose
list of athletic ailments also includes ``runner's rump'' and
``surfer's nodules.''
   The skin ``bears the brunt of the punishment'' from exercise and
develops injuries in unexpected ways, Basler said Wednesday in an
interview at the annual meeting of the American Academy of
Dermatology.
   ``The percentage of people in fitness conditioning or good
athletic programs who develop some types of skin problems is quite
large. I wouldn't be surprised if three-quarters or four-fifths of
everybody in a fitness program has some type of skin injury,'' said
Basler, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska Medical
Center and a fitness medicine expert.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Now THIS is a record collection:
   Jerry Lee Lewis' original Sun Records singles. The Rolling
Stones' first album, autographed by Mick, Keith, Charlie, Bill and
Brian. A Beatles licorice disc signed by Paul McCartney.
   But Bob George, curator of this musical menagerie, speaks with
obvious pride about another LP, ``Calypso Is Like So ...'' by Robert
Mitchum. On this record, Mitchum does something he does not do in
``War and Remembrance'': he performs ``Mama, Looka Boo Boo'' with a
psuedo-Caribbean lilt.
   ``Can you believe this? We just got it in the mail the other
day,'' said George, who (with a little help from his friends) is
trying to locate every record made since 1950 for the burgeoning
ARChive of Contemporary Music.
   ``We forbid ourselves to refuse records. The stuff the PMRC
(Parents Music Resource Center) would try to get out of libraries?
Bring it in!'' said George, who estimates the collection _ begun in
late 1985 _ now numbers almost 250,000 sound recordings.
   That attitude explains why the Butthole Surfers (a punk group)
sit beside Count Basie, and how the Beatles' classic ``Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band'' shares space with Telly ``Kojak'' Savalas'
creepy ``You've Lost That Loving Feeling.''
   The eclectic ARChive is the brainchild of George and David
Wheeler, who initially hoped to create a collection of rock 'n' roll
but soon expanded their vision to include any and all types of
popular music.
   George, producer of the breakthrough Laurie Anderson record ``O
Superman,'' brought his music-business ties and a 25,000-record
collection; Wheeler's contributions were 10,000 records and a
master's degree in library science.
   The idea (and the albums) soon found a home: above the Blarney
Castle bar in downtown Manhattan, up two rickety flights of stairs,
in a cramped loft now filled with records from acid rock to zydeco _
47,000 in all.
   The rest of the collection is somewhat far-flung, as George _ a
37-year-old Youngstown, Ohio, native _ explains in the excited voice
he affects when discussing the collection.
   ``We have one location in Chicago, one location in my parents'
basement. There's about 30,000 in Boston, 100,000 in upstate New
York, and depending on whether these two (a pair of ARChive
employees) give us their records, two other locations,'' he said.
   They also have a lot of support: every major record company
currently ships the ARChive free copies of their new releases, and
the non-profit organization's Board of Advisers includes musicians
Nile Rodgers, Paul Simon, Lou Reed and Todd Rundgren.
   ``They have a real vision of where they want to go,'' Reed said
shortly after the project first started. ``They're in it for the
long haul.''
   The singer of ``Walk on the Wild Side'' proved prophetic: George
now talks about a day five years down the road when the ARChive will
be part-library, part-museum, open to the public and available for
researchers.
   ``It's like archaeology. You're digging,'' said Thomas Cvikota,
who is handling ARChive fund-raising. ``You're going down into the
tomb, into the ruins, and finding the essence of the culture.''
   While 250,000 sound recordings sounds like an incredible
collection, the ARChive falls well short of the Library of Congress'
1.7 million records dating back to 1888. But George feels that his
system will soon make his assembly the final word in contemporary
record research.
   ``It might be arrogant, but we think we really have usurped the
function of the Library of Congress in terms of keeping track of
this material,'' he said. ``We certainly have a better hands-on
approach.''
   That approach allowed the group to help director Martin Scorcese
find the right music for ``The Last Temptation of Christ''; George
was able to hook him up with a Moroccan vocalist who did the wailing
at Lazarus' tomb in the film.
   Scorcese has since joined the Board of Advisers, a testament to
the ARChive's digging ability and its growing fame.
   The search is already under way to find expanded quarters in
Manhattan; once that's accomplished, George and company plan to
close down and take eight months to a year just cataloging records
and preparing for the grand re-opening.
   Once all that's finished, there remains at least one more problem.
   ``We read once that once a year you have to give every record a
quarter-turn, because plastic precipitates down,'' said George,
breaking into a loud laugh. ``I can imagine someone saying it now:
`OK, today your job at the ARChive is ...''

<HEAD>Cruise Ship is Only Texas-Based Casino</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORT ISABEL, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 257-foot ship named Le Mistral has
brought legal casino gambling to Texas, simply by sailing past an
unpaved Mexican fishing village just south of the border.
   Le Mistral passengers take a six- to eight-hour trip to nowhere.
No one disembarks and most never see their destination, the tiny
village of El Mezquital 30 miles south of the mouth of the Rio
Grande.
   The pass-by satisfies a state law requiring gambling ships
operating from Texas to call on a foreign port. Le Mistral's casino
cannot open until the ship reaches international waters 12 miles
offshore.
   The trips are a bold venture for Islander Cruises Ltd., based in
a strip shopping center recently renamed Bon Voyage Plaza, 10 miles
north of the border at Port Isabel. When it comes to the Texas
market, casino cruise lines are in uncharted waters.
   ``No one's operated one, not at all,'' said Templeton Fowlkes, a
Mississippi attorney with the task of guiding Islander through its
start-up period. ``We still don't know how many days they
(consumers) want and which days.''
   An ambitious schedule of nine cruises per week was scaled back to
six, at least until the weather warms up and the sea calms down. Le
Mistral made its maiden voyage Nov. 18 after being postponed twice
by choppy seas that operators feared would make passengers ill.
   The $39.95 day cruises and $49.95 evening trips feature
all-you-can-eat buffets, lounges with live entertainment and a
strolling magician.
   But the big draw is a casino with 125 slot machines, blackjack,
craps, roulette, poker and a soon-to-be-added book for betting on
sporting events.
   Le Mistral's captain clears Mexican Customs either by radio or
with the Mexican officials who often come along for the trips,
Fowlkes said. The ship is required to stay clear of El Mezquital to
avoid disturbing the small fishing boats, and passes a mile or more
offshore from the village before turning around. On return, U.S.
Customs also is cleared by radio.
   Fowlkes said the cruise offers people a chance to try out a
casino without traveling all the way to Las Vegas, Nev., or Atlantic
City, N.J.
   No single bet can exceed $200. ``You don't find the Las Vegas
people here,'' Fowlkes said. ``You don't find the high-rollers.''
   One first-night passenger won $1,000 less than 15 minutes after
the ship pulled away from the dock, according to Islander.
   But Brownsville resident Melissa Dennany said she lost $200
playing blackjack and craps in the ship's casino while celebrating
her 30th birthday. Her first gambling experience was fun, she said,
but too expensive to become a habit.
   ``I learned on that trip how addictive gambling can be,'' Ms.
Dennany said.
   The ship holds 850 people, but the company considers 500 a full
passenger load. Each trip is crewed by 120 of Islander's 300
employees.
   Fowlkes is a partner in an Ocean Springs, Miss., law firm that is
a 21 percent shareholder of Islander. Other interests in the cruise
include ship owner Burton Securities, of Athens, Greece; Miami-based
OM Consultants, managing the entertainment and casino; Harborage
Ltd. of Dallas, handling food and beverages; and Norwich,
Conn.-based Norse Enterprises, which operates the ship.
   Islander officials declined to predict the corporation's annual
income.
   Depending how the market develops, Islander may bring in larger
vessels next year for five- and seven-day cruises to points further
south in Mexico, company officials said.
   ``When that ship pulled up at the dock, we hit the turning point
of some real progress in Port Isabel and South Padre Island,'' said
Bob Goodman, president of the local Chamber of Commerce, noting that
some businesses already are linking sales increases to the new
tourist attraction.
   The Port Isabel-San Benito Navigation District spent $162,000
upgrading its port facilities prior to Le Mistral's arrival from
Greece.
   Promoters are counting on the cruises to boost the tourism
industry that already brings an estimated 2.5 million visitors a
year to South Padre Island.
   Islander has begun an aggressive newspaper, billboard and
national magazine advertising campaign, said Betty Wells, whose Port
Isabel-based Wells Media Associates Inc. provides promotions for the
company.
   Meanwhile, Corpus Christi, to the north, also is trying to
attract a cruise ship, and Galveston officials have said they want a
floating offshore casino.
   State Sen. Chet Brooks and Rep. James Hury plan to introduce a
bill in the 1989 Legislature to allow a gambling ship to operate
without calling on a foreign port.
   Area residents' eagerness for an economic boost apparently
dampened any opposition to a gambling operation.
   Ms. Wells said, ``I think a lot of that has to do with the fact
that south Texas really needs a shot in the arm right now.''

<HEAD>First Black Texas Ranger Enjoying Work, Weary of Publicity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first black lawman to become a Texas Ranger
says he is happy to be a role model but looks forward to the day
when he gets attention not because of his race but because of cases
he solves.
   Lee Roy Young Jr., after roughly three months on the job, is
taking special training and investigating cases from murder to
kidnapping.
   The 15-year veteran of the Texas Department of Public Safety said
he wants to be viewed as ``another person here working, and the only
time I'd be brought out in the limelight is when I'm working on
something that's a large investigation or something, where there's a
lot of people involved.
   ``Of course, I would much rather it (the publicity) ... just fade
away,'' he said.
   The lawman, 41, is stationed in the Dallas suburb of Garland. He
received his badge in early September.
   Young got a lot of attention when his promotion to Ranger was
announced in July. The Texas Department of Public Safety has been
accused by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People of passing over black officers for promotion and
discriminating against them in other ways.
   Young is the first black to become a Ranger in the 165-year
history of the force, which now numbers 94 men.
   He said he hasn't personally encountered discrimination, and he
hasn't seen others discriminated against.
   ``I don't see it,'' he said. ``Of course, I haven't really been
looking for it.''
   If he becomes a role model, that's OK with him.
   ``There's always that possibility, that someone will see me and
say, `If he was succussful in his chosen field, then I can go forth
and do the same in mine,''' he said.
   ``You set your sights on something, and you work toward obtaining
that goal, and don't let anything else get in your way.''
   Young dreamed of being a Ranger as a child in south Texas and
said the reality has pretty much lived up to the dream.
   ``You're trying to find or to obtain something unknown, or that's
not easily found or disclosed, so it's that challenge in itself that
I find most exciting,'' he said.
   As a Ranger, Young said he has been involved in investigations of
kidnapping, murder, narcotics, forgery, missing persons and fugitive
cases.
   Rangers are charged with four duties: protecting life and
property by enforcing state criminal statutes, suppressing riots and
insurrections, investigating major crimes and apprehending fugitives.
   Law enforcement authorites in small towns and sparsely populated
counties often call on Rangers for help.
   Before becoming a Ranger, Young was a criminal intelligence
investigator in San Antonio.
   Lately, he's been attending training sessions on such subjects as
bloodstain interpretation and making composite drawings of suspects.
   ``You never stop learning,'' he said.

<HEAD>Part I: Barth's Blunt Theological `No'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The first story of a five-part Christmas series
on modern theologians, ``God's 20th Century Giants,'' is about Karl
Barth.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   While the crowd in the lecture hall awaited the appearance of
renowned theologian Karl Barth, someone scrawled on the blackboard
behind the podium: ``God is other people.''
   The rumpled, bespectacled Barth ambled onto the stage and paused,
staring at the words. With a twinkle in his eyes, he picked up the
chalk and added a comma, making the sentence read:
   ``God is other, people.''
   That total ``otherness'' of God, beyond any human calculation or
ingenious devising, launched the thunderbolt flung by the great
Swiss scholar into the arena of 20th century theology.
   ``Only God speaks well of God,'' Barth declared, contending that
any human attempts to conceive or define him is to reduce divinity
to human dimensions, choices and control, a false idol.
   ``Let God be God,'' he said.
   Barth (pronounced Bart) is regarded by many as the century's
preeminent Christian thinker, boldly original, penetrating,
thorough, trenchantly gripping, a master in his field.
   He is one in an extraordinary line of theological titans who
crossed the world's stage this century and changed the landscape of
religious thought.
   Among them were Barth's Swiss compatriot, Emil Bruner; the German
martyr to Nazism, Dietrich Bonhoeffer; the Roman Catholic
``incarnationalist'' Karl Rahner; the ``demythologizing'' Rudolf
Bultmann; Judaism's ``relationist'' Martin Buber; the existentialist
Paul Tillich, and Christian ``realist'' Reinhold Niebuhr.
   These modern religious giants all are dead, and, as the century
draws to a close, it's almost as though some special dispensation
has ended. But their work, both emulated and criticized, permeates
the religious world.
   To Barth, the remoteness of a ``wholly other'' God constituted
his stern ``No'' to a sin-darkened world.
   Trying to know anything about God through reasoning, nature,
sentiments or philosophical arguments is vain and benighted, Barth
said, reflecting humanity's original revolt by trying itself to ``be
as God.''
   ``It is the attempted replacement of divine work by human
manufacture,'' Barth said, an effort to ``divinize man and to
humanize God with romantic formulations'' so as to ``wipe out the
distance between them. ...
   ``God is not to be sought out in his inscrutable loftiness.''
   However, Barth said, God took the initiative to turn that
overshadowing ``No'' into a ringing ``Yes'' through the work of
Christ and the ``Word of God.''
   ``And so,'' he said, ``his inevitable `No' is always enclosed in
his primary `Yes' to man.''
   Barth called Christ both ``God's man'' and ``man's God,'' and
said:
   ``In the midst of his people, God lets one become man, espousing
totally the cause of this man,'' attesting identity with him, thus
enacting ``community with man'' and exalting man to ``community with
him.''
   Barth, who died in 1968 at age 82, belonged to the Swiss Reformed
Church, but his powerful, free-thinking scholarship carried weight
not only throughout Protestantism but also in Catholicism, with
whose thinkers he maintained a running dialogue.
   In the scholarly world, Barth's approach became known as
``neo-orthodox'' or ``Barthian,'' a term he deplored. He called his
work ``evangelical theology.'' It is firmly, steadily rooted in
Scripture.
   ``The biblical witnesses are better informed than are the
theologians,'' he said. ``For this reason theology must agree to let
them look over its shoulder and correct its notebooks.''
   For all his immense erudition and analytical skills, the
pipe-smoking Barth had a kindly, cheerful disposition and whimsical,
self-effacing wit, seeming to take himself much less seriously than
did some of his colleagues.
   ``The theologian who has no joy in his work is not a theologian
at all,'' he said. ``Sulky faces, morose thoughts and boring ways
are intolerable in this science.''
   He had a zest for history, literature, music and detective
stories. Once, fretting about whether he would be understood in some
1962 lectures in the United States, he remarked, ``My English is
criminal because I learned it by reading detective stories.''
   Tender and gruff, modest but assured, he rode horseback, sang
loudly _ ``like a lion,'' as a son put it _ preached regularly to
penitentiary prisoners and began his days listening to Mozart.
   ``It may be that when the angels go about their task of praising
God, they play only Bach,'' he said. ``I am sure, however, that when
they are together en famille, they play Mozart and then, too, our
dear Lord listens with a special pleasure.''
   Besides Barth's driving theological work through a score of
books, including his 12-volume ``Church Dogmatics,'' and in lectures
around the world, he led efforts for Christian unity and to forge
church resistance to the Nazis.
   The church ``would do better to become a tiny remnant and flee to
the catacombs than to make peace with this terrible doctrine in any
way,'' he said of Nazism.
   Barth, then teaching in Bonn, Germany, helped to form the
Confessing Church, a minority wing opposing Hitler's policies, and
to organize the 1934 meeting that issued the famed Barmen
Declaration, blasting attempts to subordinate the church to
Hitlerism.
   Shortly thereafter, Barth was expelled for refusing to take an
oath of allegiance to Hitler or begin classes with the customary
``Heil Hitler.''
   He hurled his blunt ``No'' to human presumptions about
understanding God at a time when Christian liberals believed
scientific progress and education would gradually help achieve
paradise on Earth _ a notion shattered by the horrors of war and
totalitarianism.
   ``The final root and basis of all human disorder is the dreadful,
godless, ridiculous idea that humanity is the Atlas to hold up the
vault of heaven,'' Barth told the 1948 founding assembly of the
World Council of Churches.
   Nevertheless, he said, God ``is no lonely God, self-sufficient
and self-contained.''
   Rather, he freely chooses through Christ to be the ``God of
man,'' Barth said. ``He exists neither next to man nor merely above
him, but rather with him, by him, and most of all for him.
   ``A God who confronted man simply as exalted, distant and
strange, that is, a divinity without humanity, could be only the god
of ... `bad news' instead of the `good news.' ... He would be the
god of a scornful, judging, deadly `No.'''
   However, Barth said, ``the content of God's word is his free,
undeserved `Yes' to the whole human race, in spite of all human
unreasonableness and corruption.''
   Jesus ``exposes the gulf which separates God and man and by
exposing it, bridges it,'' Barth said, leaving humanity ``swamped by
grace.''
   Barth rejected biblical literalism, contending the Bible was not
verbally infallible since everything human, including language, is
limited and faulty.
   Yet he saw Scripture as the medium elected by God as the most
suitable within man's restricted sights for extending ``God's word''
to humanity.
   In a conversation with Barth, fellow Swiss theologian Emil Bruner
once raised the point that some of the Bible seemed profane.
   ``Nonsense, it's all profane!'' Barth retorted. ``The Bible was
written by very profane men. But, and this is the distinction, they
were profane men in conversation with God.''

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The second installment in a five-part Christmas
series on great modern theologians, ``God's 20th Century Giants,''
concerns Paul Tillich, a ``boundary man'' with an appeal to
intellectuals.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   As a young, front-line army chaplain in World War I, Paul Tillich
was so seared by the carnage and bursting shells around him that he
suffered psychological turmoil for months. But he found solace in
visiting art museums and meditating on great religious paintings.
   They have a ``power to stabilize and power to transform,'' he
wrote later.
   Staring at Botticelli's ``Madonna'' or other masterworks, he
sensed that divine reality could be revealed through art forms _
``expressing the holy'' through ``form-transcendence.''
   That intuition animated the approach of this towering existential
theologian and philosopher who, as he put it, labored ``on the
boundaries'' between church and society, between faith and culture,
insisting on their interaction.
   Modern culture ``has lost its ultimate reference, its center of
meaning, its spiritual substance,'' he said, leaving a secularized
void of emptiness, anxiety and pointlessness.
   A man of natural dignity and gentle warmth, Tillich's
unconventional interpretations often shocked the orthodox. But they
radiated an unfettered candor and dominating commitment.
   ``I was thinking about infinity from the age of 8,'' he said.
   He couched religious concepts in fresh, often startling
terminology to prick contemporary minds. He called faith ``ultimate
concern,'' saying it demands the ``courage to be'' in the face of
threatened ``non-being'' _ death. He termed Christ the ``New
Being,'' whose incarnation expresses ``the paradox ... of God
accepting a world which rejects him.''
   Tillich called biblical accounts of supernatural occurrences
``symbols'' but said ``something happens through'' them ``which has
effects and consequences.''
   He said Christ was the ``bearer of a new eon'' who participates
in human suffering and death, overcoming the ``estrangement between
man and God'' through ``acceptance of the unacceptable.''
   ``The saving power of the New Being in Jesus as the Christ,'' he
said, ``is dependent on man's participation in it.''
   He said its renewing power often strikes ``when we are in great
pain and restlessness'' or in ``our indifference, our weakness, our
hostility and our lack of direction and composure.''
   ``It strikes when we walk through the dark valley of a
meaningless and empty life. ... At that moment a wave of light
breaks into our darkness, and it is as though a voice were saying:
You are accepted, accepted by that which is greater than you.''
   Don't try to analyze or define it, he said. ``Simply accept the
fact that you are accepted! ... In that moment, grace conquers sin,
and reconciliation bridges the gulf of estrangement. And nothing is
demanded ... but acceptance,'' to ``accept oneself as accepted in
spite of being unacceptable.''
   Tillich, as a ``boundary man,'' standing between a heritage
imbued with the sacred and an age cut off from it, saw himself as a
mediator working to close a rupture he considered a threat to
Western civilization.
   ``Religion is the substance of culture, and culture the form of
religion,'' he said. ``There is no life where there is no
`otherness.'''
   He died in 1965 at age 79, scorned by traditionalists but
enduringly esteemed by others for his powerful reformulation of
Christian concepts.
   He tackled the century's most ``salient tension'' between
religion and secularization, wrote Mark Kline Taylor, a Princeton
theologian, in a l987 book, ``Paul Tillich.''
   He exerted a formative influence, pointing theologians ``toward
renewed Christian hope along a journey'' where risks of ``the void
attend each step they take,'' Taylor wrote.
   Using his inventive, often arresting religious lexicon, Tillich
said God was not ``a being'' or even the ``highest being'' alongside
other beings.
   ``When applied to God, superlatives become diminuitives,'' he
said. He termed God ``Being-itself'' or ``Ground of Being,'' the
dynamic ``power of being in everything and above everything'' that
energizes and gives cohesion to all authentic endeavor.
   However, he says people have become ``estranged from the ultimate
power of being,'' submerged in anxiety, loneliness and guilt,
disillusioned by always collapsing ``idolatries'' of nationalism,
technology, possessions, sex or success.
   He described sin as ``separation'' _ separation from others, from
one's self and from the ``Ground'' of one's being.
   ``We not only suffer ... because of the self-destructive
consequences of our separation, but also know why we suffer,''
Tillich said. ``We know that we are estranged from something to
which we really belong. ...
   ``We feel that something radical, total and unconditional is
demanded of us, but we rebel against it, try to escape its urgency
and will not accept its promise.''
   This awareness of ``our separation from the rest of life is most
acute when we are surrounded by it in noises and talk,'' he said,
such as the intense loneliness that can descend in a crowded room.
   ``We realize then much more than in moments of solitude how
strange we are to each other, how estranged life is from life,'' he
said.
   Yet, ``we cannot escape ... the Ground of our being'' but ``are
bound to it for all eternity, just as we are bound to ourselves and
to all other life. We always remain in the power of that from which
we are estranged.''
   ``That fact brings us to the ultimate depth of sin: separated and
yet bound, estranged and yet belonging, destroyed and yet preserved,
that state which is called despair ... `the sickness unto death.'''
   Tillich, reared in Germany as the son of a Lutheran minister and
ordained himself, initially taught at German universities. But his
early criticisms of Hitler led to his expulsion in 1933 along with
many Jewish professors, including the great Martin Buber.
   Tillich once observed he was the first non-Jewish academician
``to be so honored.'' Emigrating to the United States, he became a
citizen and taught for 32 years at New York's Union Theological
Seminary, Harvard and the University of Chicago.
   In his gravelly, accented voice, he engaged students in searching
dialogues, relishing after-hours bull sessions.
   His three-volume ``Systematic Theology'' and numerous other books
interweave disciplines of history, psychology, political science,
art and philosophy. He gained a wide audience among government and
academic leaders, believers and nonbelievers.
   F. Forrester Church, a Unitarian Universalist minister, terms
Tillich an ``apostle to the intellectuals,'' adding in a 1987
anthology, ``The Essential Tillich'':
   ``We need a Tillich to guide us through the perils of our age.''
   Tillich said it was ``blasphemous and ridiculous'' to try to
prove existence of an infinite God, utterly beyond finite human
categories.
   Yet, he said, humans realize their limited finitude, and by that
very fact, transcend it in awareness of some potential infinity.
   He says that realization is an existential pointer to God. ``God
is the answer to the question implied in man's finitude,'' he said.
   Yet, anxiety and doubt remain. Divine reality would not be that
at all if people could verify it, he said. ``Without conquered
doubt, there is no faith. Faith must overcome something; it must
leap over the ordinary processes. ...
   ``Faith is the courage that conquers doubt not by removing it,
but by taking it as an element into itself.''

<BYLINE>Part III: Buber _ Life in Encounter
   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The third story in a five-part Christmas series
on great modern theologians, ``God's 20th Century Giants,'' is about
Martin Buber and his discerning truth in encounter.
   ___

<TEXT>
   Out of friendship for one of the leaders, Martin Buber was
marching in a street procession. As the marchers passed a cafe, he
locked gazes with a musician he'd dined with the day before.
   The musician ``apparently saw me alone, and waved to me,'' Buber
recounted. ``Straightway it seemed to me as though I were taken out
of the procession and the presence of my marching friends, and set
there confronting the musician.
   ``I forgot that I was walking along with the same step; I felt
that I was standing over there by the man who had called out to me,
and without a word, with a smile of understanding, was answering
him.''
   By the time Buber again became conscious of the procession around
him, the cafe was far behind.
   The incident _ that minor, transporting moment with the musician
_ reflects the pervasive thesis of a man regarded as one of the 20th
century's greatest philosophers.
   Buber maintained that human wholeness, its vitalizing reality,
exists only ``in between'' separate persons, other creatures, nature
and God _ a connecting mutuality recognized only in genuine
encounter.
   ``All real living is meeting,'' he said. Real living exists only
in honest, open give-and-take between separate selves, an interflow
that surpasses both and augments each.
   Through unaffected personal engagement in the encounter,
participants are lifted out of themselves, he said. The ``extended
lines of relations meet in the Eternal Thou,'' the ``Center,'' in
the consummate reality of God.
   In every genuinely open contact, ``we are stirred by the breath
of a Thou, that is, of eternal life,'' he said. ``If you hallow this
life, you meet the living God.''
   Buber's ideas spawned a widespread ``relational'' theology
throughout Christianity and also in Judaism, sometimes in simplified
popular versions.
   Buber, a Jew whose Christian wife converted to Judaism, was an
influential figure in the expanding concourse between these linked
traditions.
   In his book about Christian-Jewish ties, ``Two Types of Faith,''
Buber said, ``From my youth onwards I have found in Jesus my great
brother.
   ``That Christianity has regarded and does regard him as God and
savior has always appeared to me a fact of the highest importance
which, for his sake and my own, I must endeavor to understand. ...
   ``My own fraternally open relationship to him has grown ever
stronger and clearer.''
   A short, stocky man with a flowing white beard and disarming
smile, Buber was born in Austria and taught at universities in
Germany until silenced by the Nazis in 1934.
   Emigrating to Israel, he taught at the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem, lectured widely and wrote many books, including a German
translation of the Bible and his best-selling ``I and Thou.''
   An Hasidic scholar and independent-minded Zionist, he advocated
Arab-Jewish cooperation and was criticized by some fellow Jews for
it. His death in 1965 at age 87 prompted an unprecedented tribute: A
delegation of Arab students placed a wreath on his grave.
   For his relational theology, Buber coined an almost poetic
terminology to distinguish between ``I-it'' relations, which reduce
people and things to utilitarian objects, and ``I-Thou'' relations,
which enhance and authenticate the being of both partners.
   Buber saw modern humanity as trapped in a self-insulating ``I''
of individualism that ``hardens into the world of It.''
   In an atmosphere of depersonalizing forces and mechanized
systems, people adjust themselves to ``the apparatus'' as if mere
cogs in it, he said, debasing ``man's power to enter into relation.''
   ``The sickness of our age is like that of no other age'' under
the ``tyranny of the exuberantly growing It,'' he said. ``The
quasi-biological and quasi-historical thoughts of today ... have
worked together to establish a more tenacious and oppressive''
fatalism ``than has ever before existed.''
   This is the ``exalted melancholy of our age, that every Thou in
our world must become an It,'' he said.
   Yet at times a person, ``shuddering at the alienation between the
I and the world, comes to reflect that something is to be done,''
Buber said.
   ``As when in the grave night-hour you lie racked by waking dream
_ bulwarks have fallen away and the abyss is screaming _ and note
amid your torment: there is life, if I could only get through to
it.''
   Buber sees earthly existence as a duality in which people
necessarily objectify their surroundings as ``Its'' so as to make
for orderly arrangements, bounded, measured and codified.
   This structuring is needed for functioning of institutions,
sciences and societies and is not itself evil, but can be degrading
if it is the predominating attitude, he said, adding:
   ``Without It man cannot live. But he who lives with It alone is
not a man.''
   To truly live requires a continual ``turning'' to relations, he
said, a repeated ``crossing the threshold'' between a functional
environment of things binding people most of the time and the ``holy
place'' of dialogue, connections and mutuality.
   He said mere greetings can reflect the different dispositions,
such as the virtually impersonal ``Hello, how are you?'' and the
direct, body-related greeting of African Kaffirs, ``I see you.''
   The fuller reality _ the ``revealing by two people of the Thou to
one another'' _ can be seen especially in good marriages, he said.
   ``He who lives with a woman, and brings her life to present
realization in his, is able to look in the Thou of her eyes into a
beam of the eternal Thou,'' he said.
   Buber says this enlarging, connecting quality can be realized not
only between persons, but with all nature. For example, a cat or
tree can be viewed merely as of a certain type, dimension,
conformation and color. But none of these is the whole ``being'' of
the cat or tree, he said.
   If alert to the ``simple magic of life'' in nature, ``there is a
reciprocity of the being itself,'' he said. ``You say Thou to (the
tree) and give yourself to it, and it says Thou to you and gives
itself to you. ... Something lights up and approaches us from the
source of being.''
   Buber attributes this innate reality of all created being to the
``primal, the origin,'' and says it shows up in primitive people's
intercourse with nature and in a young child's personification of
toys, animals and objects.
   ``It is the instinct to make everything into Thou, to give
relation to the universe,'' he said.
   An overshadowing peril to humanity is to sink into self-absorbed
individualism, sundered from connected ``being,'' Buber said.
   ``Individualism neither shares in nor obtains any reality. The
more a man, humanity, is mastered by individuality, the deeper does
the I sink into the unreality'' of a ``hidden subterranean ...
canceled existence.''
   He said people ``need ... to confirm one another in their
individual being by means of genuine meeting. ... It is from one man
to another that the heavenly bread is passed.''

<TEXT>
   This fourth story of a five-part Christmas series
on great modern theologians, ``God's 20th Century Giants,'' is about
Karl Rahner and Rudolf Bultmann.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A reader once sent renowned Roman Catholic scholar Karl Rahner a
cartoon depicting him as a brainy ``theological atomic physicist''
expounding from a desk high above others.
   Below him, busy ``multipliers'' carve up his ideas, handing the
pieces down to popularizing ``simplifiers.'' Off to the side, a
puzzled Jesus says, ``I don't understand.''
   Smiling about the cartoon in a 1979 interview, Rahner said it
``captures to a large extent the lot of theologians'' in modern
times because their work is often regarded as ``unintelligible
nonsense.''
   ``One should not get up on his high horse and decide that
specific questions have been settled for another or for oneself,''
he said, ``especially today in our skeptical and relativistic age.''
   A modest, unpretentious streak marked this 20th century
theological giant who scaled the intellectual heights of faith and,
with a common touch, rendered them in terms of ordinary life.
   He said our limited humanity can't imagine the unconditional,
immeasurable God, but he ``is already present in human existence,
silent and hidden. ... It is a knowledge we cannot grasp, but
whereby we are grasped.''
   Rahner is often called an ``incarnationalist'' or
``anthropocentrist'' who saw divine promptings in the human grain.
He wanted to focus more keenly on this internal presence, rather
than try to ``to drum into somebody an authoritative doctrine that
is external.''
   Rahner worked to bridge the gap between theological complexities
and contemporary thought.
   He also wrote gently of the grace-bestowing significance of
everyday living, such as working, playing, laughing, sleeping.
   Life bears a supernatural element that can be suppressed and also
``can be realized and experienced existentially from within,'' he
said. To him, that simple, intimate ``indefinable mysticism of
everyday life'' is the essence of Christianity.
   Rahner called Christ the ``revealing, self-communication of
God,'' the ``mystery of God sharing himself with us.''
   This is a ``quiet, unobtrusive process'' at work daily, he said,
yet it is the ``great sign that God himself has directly intervened
in the world.''
   Rahner originated a new religious category, ``Anonymous
Christianity,'' saying it embraced Buddhists, various other
non-Christians and even athiests who are conscientious, upright and
caring.
   ``Some kind of faith in God is basically there, whether they know
it or not,'' he said. They are a part of a ``Christianity that does
not call itself Christianity ... `pagans' who have received grace,
but who are not aware of it.''
   Rahner tangled often with Vatican authorities, who at times
castigated and even silenced him, but they never shifted him from
his humanizing tack.
   ``Ecclesiastical dignitaries'' tend to embrace elaborate dogmas
``on which modern man is quite incapable of basing his faith,'' he
commented.
   Despite his conflicts with officialdom, Rahner emerged as an
influential adviser at the reforming Second Vatican Council of
1962-65.
   His last book, ``Unity of the Churches _ An Actual Possibility,''
which he wrote with fellow German Catholic theologian Heinrich
Fries, jolted churchdom. It declared that all main branches of
Christianity _ Protestant, Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic _
sufficiently agreed on basic concepts to unite in one church.
   ``This unity is a matter of life or death for Christiandom at a
time when faith in God and Christ are most seriously threatened,''
wrote Rahner and Fries.
   They proposed that traditions of each denomination be continued
within a unified church, recognizing the pope's leadership but
without binding authority, making church-wide decisions in inclusive
councils and sharing pulpits and Holy Communion.
   Rahner, a Jesuit priest, was a friend of another theological
titan, Rudolf Bultmann, a fellow German, Lutheran and
ground-breaking thinker who modified the contours of contemporary
theology.
   He, like Rahner, sought to link theology and modern thought, but
in a more radical way.
   ``Theology will never be the same because of Bultmann. Never
ever,'' said American Methodist scholar Shubert M. Ogden.
   Bultmann, the most controversial of the century's theological
stars, was attacked in many countries as a heretic for his
``demythologizing'' of the Bible.
   The Bible's pre-scientific view of a universe with heaven above,
hell below and Earth between, traversed by angels and demons, was
incredible to modern man, he maintained. He said it should be
replaced with an updated world-view that preserved the profound
meanings inside the obsolete framework.
   He said stripping away the antiquated trappings of the New
Testament would clarify the basic message so it could be heard. That
message, he said, is the power of ``God's word which encounters man
in the proclamation of Jesus Christ.''
   Christ is ``God breaking in,'' Bultmann said.
   He regarded Jesus as a historical figure and his crucifixion as
factual. Much, however, about the life of Jesus _ his miracles, the
resurrection and his ascent into heaven _ were myths the early
Christians used to explain how Jesus reconciled humanity to God,
Bultmann said.
   To Bultmann, myths were not fairy tales but covers for deep
realities. The resurrection, he said, shows ``death is not a sinking
into nothing, but (that) the same God who is always coming to us
also meets us in our death.''
   Bultmann, 91 when he died in 1976, remained a powerful influence
on Protestant and Catholic biblical studies, although his views were
spurned by literalists. His existential approach somewhat resembled
that of Rahner, who nevertheless adhered more thoroughly to
classical interpretations.
   Rahner died in 1984 at the age of 80.
   ``We are living in the midst of a transitional period of great
scope and depth'' that threatens faith but holds eventual promise
for it, Rahner said. Humanity, he said, is fashioning an utterly new
environnment in which technology replaces nature itself.
   While nature once seemed mysterious, ``we no longer live in
nature; we transform it,'' he said. ``In wide areas we do not face a
nature that God has made but one that we have made.''
   Like nature, the man-structured environment remains ``finally
uncontrollable'' and more dangerous, its ``future shrouded in
mist,'' he said. Instead of mystery arising from nature, it now is
``welling up out of man himself.''
   While ``religious elements in man'' temporarily ``have been
pushed into the background,'' Rahner said, ``man has only to make
himself at home again'' in his new environment, as he once was in
nature, and his religious awareness will ``arise again to a degree
and extent hardly imaginable today.''
   As in such an atmosphere, Bultmann noted that often when first
listening to a symphony, the basic melody eludes the listener
``because you are deafened by the fullness of detail'' and a
``veritable sea of sounds and impressions.''
   But in a while, he said, ``as with one magicial stroke, a single
unified world emerges from the confused welter of sound,'' and it
becomes clear that the ``fundamental tone'' was there all the time.
   So it is in discerning the ``mighty note of God'' in the
temporary confusion, Bultmann said. ``It is always the same old
theme endlessly proceeding in ever new ways ... always more
tempestuous, always more powerful.''

<HEAD>Part V: Niebuhr and Bonhoeffer _ Christian `Realists'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The final installment of a five-part Christmas
series on great modern theologians, ``God's 20th Century Giants,''
concerns Reinhold Niebuhr and Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Before a roomful of notables gathered to honor him, an elderly
Reinhold Niebuhr ticked off various trends that he saw as making a
mess of the world. He paused, grinned and said, ``But I like it.''
   He relished the struggles for good in this clamorous world and
for a half-century stayed wholeheartedly in their midst, striving
for sense and reason.
   ``He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh,'' he frequently
said, quoting a Psalm about God's laughter at humanity's blustering
presumptions of absolute solutions.
   ``The whole drama of human history is under the scrutiny of a
divine judge who laughs at human pretensions without being hostile
to human aspirations,'' he said.
   Upholding what he termed ``Christian realism,'' Niebuhr is
generally regarded as the century's premier American theologian.
   ``No one else could speak with such authority to Christian, Jew
and non-believer,'' wrote historian Richard Fox in a 1987 biography.
``He was assuredly an American phenomenon.''
   Often quoted by presidents and statesmen, he was both incisive
thinker and working dynamo _ a media commentator, social critic,
political organizer, prolific author and seminary professor.
   At New York's Union Theological Seminary, he customarily reserved
Thursday nights for ``at home'' conversations with students, nimbly
dissecting their questions, striding the room and trailing cigarette
smoke.
   Niebuhr sought to ``establish relevance'' and working
applicability of faith to the world. He disdained sanctimony and
cant in both religion and politics.
   After accusing President Richard Nixon of ``court piety'' in the
White House and ``madness'' in expanding the Vietnam war, Niebuhr
said, ``God told us to love our enemies, not to like them.''
   While Niebuhr said inherent ``sin'' was the one church doctrine
thoroughly verified by history, he also insisted doggedly on the
undetermined ``possibilities of the good and the obligations to
realize them'' in this world, always recognizing there ``will be
some corruption, as well as deficiency of virtue and truth'' in
every achievement.
   He saw Christ as the ``final perfection of man ... impossible
possiblity ... citadel of hope (and) moral beauty ... (the)
redemptive force.''
   Christ is the ``symbol of ultimate reality'' who reveals that
self-sacrificial love, though crushed by history, rises above it,
Niebuhr said.
   Humanity's existence is never fulfilled, he said. ``This is the
final enigma ... for which there is no answer except by faith and
hope.''
   This was the prodding ``Christian realism'' that Niebuhr injected
into the political sphere. He himself abandoned early socialism and
pacifism as unreal idealisms and saw prospects in this world as
always fragmentary, a matter of compromises and trade-offs for
partial, relative good.
   Often, he said, there are no clear-cut ``right'' decisions, only
ambiguous alternatives and the hope that good outweighs evil. For
instance, nuclear deterrence leaves both superpowers clinging to
nuclear weapons for security yet standing in terror of them.
   A ``sorry predicament,'' he said, but imposed by circumstances.
He saw reality as shot through with irony, ambiguity, contradiction
and paradox.
   The ``biblical interpretation of the human situation is ironic
rather than tragic or pathetic,'' he said, since people are free to
do good but, in their ``predatory self-interest,'' do not.
   Niebuhr helped pull Americans from early isolationist attitudes
toward Hitler and urged opening U.S. shores to European Jews. He was
among the first Christian theologians to oppose attempts to convert
Jews.
   In the prelude to World War II, he brought to Union Theological
Seminary a brilliant young Lutheran scholar, Dietrich Bonhoeffer,
whom he had met in Europe.
   In 1930s Germany, Bonhoeffer had been a marked man to Gestapo
eyes, having early assailed Hitler's anti-Jewish doctrines.
   Brought to America for safety in 1939, he remained only a short
time, telling Niebuhr he had ``to share the trials of this time with
my people.'' He returned, worked with the resistance, ran an
underground seminary and joined the abortive plot by German officers
to assassinate Hitler.
   Confined in a series of concentration camps, he was hanged April
9, 1945, at age 39, shortly before the camp was liberated by
American troops.
   A ``Christian realist'' of Niebuhr's stripe, Bonhoeffer's widely
read writings, such as ``The Cost of Discipleship'' and ``Letters
and Papers from Prison,'' have made him another of the century's
theological giants.
   Like Niebuhr, he said Christians should not withdraw into
other-worldliness, but plunge into the secular world, struggling and
suffering as Christ did to work some good.
   He said this ``world come of age,'' with all its technical
advances, ``seems to round itself off without God,'' feeling
increasingly able to deal with its questions without recourse to
conventional religion.
   He called for a ``religionless Christianity,'' stripped of its
concentration on private piety and other-worldliness and lived in
deeds of service ``to participate in the suffering of God in
Christ.''
   It should ``not be faith that flees the world, but the one that
endures the world,'' he said.
   He said God was ``not on the borders of life, but at its center.
... We should find God in what we do know, not in what we don't. ...
Those who evade the Earth do not find God. ... They find a world
beyond, to be sure, but one that is not God's world, that world
which is dawning in this world.''
   In a similar vein, Niebuhr said:
   ``The new world must be built by resolute men who when hope is
dead will hope by faith, who will neither seek premature escape from
the guilt of history, nor yet call the evil, which taints all their
achievements, good.''
   Concerning latter-day forms of escapism, Niebuhr said,
``insecurities of our age strongly tempt this generation not to
utopianism of yesterday but to flight into any kind of storm cellar
of religious security'' tied to other-worldliness, irresponsible to
the present world.
   He denounced America's ``consumer culture'' and
``moral-sounding'' political deceptions, its religious ``smugness''
and easy answers.
   He assailed the 1963 Supreme Court decision outlawing school
prayer, saying it suppressed ``free exercise'' of religion and
imposed a secular philosophy that ``is itself a religion.''
   He saw ``will to power'' as the essence of politics, restrained
only by the checks-and-balances of the U.S. Constitution.
   ``Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible,'' he said,
``but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.''
   Beginning as a Lutheran-Reformed pastor in Detroit, where his
pro-labor tangles with the auto industry drew national attention, he
shifted to Union Seminary, his base for 32 years. After retirement,
he served on various study commissions and still poured out a
torrent of books and articles. He died in 1971 shortly at 78.
   ``The human story is too grand and too awful to be told without
reverence for the mystery and the majesty that transcends all human
knowledge,'' he said.
   ``Only humble men who recognize the mystery and the majesty are
able to face both the beauty and terror of life without exulting
over its beauty or becoming crushed by its terror.''

<TEXT>
   On a sultry day last summer, a lifelong con
died behind bars, revealing a terrible secret hidden for a decade.
He had gotten away with murder.
   Finally made public was a confession the inmate had shared with
his attorney 10 years earlier, a confession to a killing for which
another man, the victim's husband, had served 13{ years in prison.
   His words, true or false, have resurrected an old crime and
raised new questions about whether justice was denied a young man in
a Nebraska courtroom more than three decades ago.
   This is a tale of two men and a tragedy _ the 1955 murder of
Nancy Parker. Her husband, Darrel, confessed but quickly recanted
and later claimed the confession had been coerced. Twenty-three
years later and nearly a decade after Parker was freed, death row
inmate Wesley Peery confessed on the condition his statement be
released only after he died.
   Peery's death in July broke the seal of confidentiality, and
although some still insist Parker is guilty, he hopes to clear his
name. He has appealed to the Nebraska Board of Pardons, which meets
Dec. 15, a day after the 33rd anniversary of the crime.
   The three-member panel, which has been given a sealed transcript
of Peery's confession, will decide whether to pardon Parker, reject
his request or hold a hearing with witnesses next year.
   The confession was among two years of taped and written
interviews Peery gave in hopes a book would be written about his
exploits. In the interviews, he boasted of killing 12 people over
four decades.
   Lawyers for Peery and Parker are convinced an innocent man was
sentenced to life in prison in 1956.
   ``It's a horrible miscarriage of justice,'' said attorney Stanley
Cohen, who represented Peery and taped the interviews from 1978 to
1980. ``It's hard to imagine what somebody was going through
spending 13 years-plus in prison and another 18 years after being
released not being able to show he was wrongly convicted of a
murder.''
   But others discount Peery's confession and maintain justice
prevailed.
   ``He did it. There's no question in the world about it,'' said
Eugene Masters, retired head of detectives who questioned Parker.
``They come up with this fairy tale and wait till the man's dead.''
   Parker, 57, released in 1969 after an appeals court said his
rights had been violated, has remarried and is now parks supervisor
in Moline, Ill. Other than expressing relief, Parker refused comment
when contacted by telephone.
   But his lawyer, Richard Bruckner, said Parker had told him ``he
knew ... or hoped all the time he'd be cleared of this. He said,
`All I want is a piece of paper _ a complete pardon finally clearing
my name.' ...
   ``Sure he has bitterness,'' Bruckner added. ``But he says, `What
good is that going to do?' He has to go on with his life.''
   Darrel Parker's experiences with the criminal justice system
began Dec. 14, 1955, when he came home for lunch and found the
partially clad body of Nancy Ellen, his wife of little more than a
year, on their bed.
   The 22-year-old woman had been strangled. Her hands were bound,
and she'd been gagged with her husband's handkerchiefs. Evidence
showed she had been raped.
   Peery, a co-worker of Parker's who had a criminal record, was
questioned because his Ford had been parked nearby that morning. But
Peery said he often drove through the area taking his mother to
work. Peery passed a polygraph test, Masters said.
   Parker, in Iowa for his wife's funeral, was summoned to help with
the investigation. He was not told he was a suspect, Bruckner said.
When he returned to Lincoln, he was hooked up to a lie detector and
questioned by John Reid, a noted Chicago criminologist and polygraph
expert.
   Parker later testified he had no lawyer and gave no permission to
be questioned. This all happened before the Supreme Court's Miranda
decision, which gave suspects the right to attorneys and a warning
they can remain silent.
   Parker testified he feared Reid, who sat knee-to-knee with him,
grasped Parker by the chin, stroked his head ``as if I were some
kind of animal'' and threatened he'd ``fry'' if he didn't produce
his wife's missing watch. It never was found.
   Parker said Reid accused his wife of ``refusing me relations''
and suggested she ``was probably running around with another man.''
Parker insisted his marriage was sound.
   Parker testified that in several hours of questioning he
repeatedly denied killing his wife. But Masters says Parker knew
``all the details. He said he hit her in the left eye, which was
true. He said he knocked the lamp off the table, which was true. ...
There were 13 things in the confession that no one in the world but
he could know about.''
   Bruckner, however, said Reid took details from investigators and
fed them to Parker until he parroted them. ``Reid just kept working
on him. The words in the confession were John Reid's, not his,'' he
said.
   Reid is dead, but Fred Inbau, professor emeritus at Northwestern
Law School, who assisted him, insists talk of a forced confession is
``a lot of nonsense.''
   But in 1969, an appeals court said the confessions were ``coerced
and involuntary'' and Reid's ``activities clearly went beyond
approved standards.'' It ordered Parker be given a new trial or
freed. He was on parole until 1975.

   Until his parole, Parker was imprisoned at the Nebraska State
Penitentiary _ where Peery eventually wound up on a rape conviction,
later reversed.
   Bruckner said Peery taunted Parker, saying: ```Darrel, if your
folks could put up money for my bond, I can lead you to the guy who
killed your wife. I can tell you where the suitcases (belonging to
Mrs. Parker) are.' Darrel didn't even know suitcases were missing.''
   Peery had been in and out of prison since his teen years on
charges including robbery and burglary. In 1976, he was sentenced to
death for fatally shooting a woman in a coin shop.
   ``He was king when he had a gun,'' said Cohen, who defended him
in that case. ``He had no conscience.''
   While appealing the murder conviction, Peery said he hoped a book
could be written that would provide income for his relatives after
his death, and Cohen began taping interviews with his client.
   Having heard rumors about Peery's possible involvement in the
Parker murder, the attorneys asked him. ``He took credit for it
right away,'' Cohen said.
   According to Cohen, Peery drew a blueprint of the Parker house
with correctly placed furniture and recounted birthmarks on Mrs.
Parker's chest. He also provided one critical detail of the crime
that had never been publicized, that the attacker had ejaculated on
the woman's thigh.
   Peery also said he'd taken Mrs. Parker's watch and eventually
fenced it.
   Peery confessed to other murders, Cohen said, and in some sketchy
checking of a few, ``they turn out to be exactly what he says.''
   ``When he talked about the murders, he would smirk and smile and
display a sense of pride,'' added Toney Redman, Cohen's partner and
a distant cousin of Parker. ``It's kind of like a little kid
bringing out his Cub Scout awards.''
   The attorneys became convinced Peery was the killer, but they had
sworn to withhold the information. ``That was our agreement with
him,'' Cohen said. ``Even though he was a murderer, that doesn't
mean my word isn't any good.''
   But Masters now asks: ``Why on earth if a couple of attorneys had
this story would they wait till the man's dead?''
   After Peery's death at age 56, the attorneys talked with
Bruckner, who has represented Parker 24 years.
   Bruckner said he'd always had a fantasy, that he would ``run down
as they strapped (Peery) in the electric chair and say, `Clear
yourself with God and tell me you did it.'''
   Today, he has an ink-and-paper transcript.

   Some younger pupils stifled yawns and
fidgeted as the strains of Camille Saint-Saens' Second Piano
Concerto in G Minor, played by the school orchestra, filled the
assembly hall.
   Thus began another day at Rugby for 730 youngsters of the latest
generation to have minds refined and upper lips stiffened by that
durable and distinctively British institution, the public school.
   Piles of schoolbooks lay in a misty rain around the doorway of
the Temple Speech Room. The hall is a place for concerts, speeches
and other important events, so the distraction of books is not
permitted inside.
   Traditions die hard, if at all, at this 421-year-old school in
the English Midlands, where the game of rugby was invented and
Thomas Arnold, that great Victorian and Rugby headmaster, set his
1857 novel ``Tom Brown's Schooldays.'' Arnold's tale of courageous
young Tom pitted against the evil bully Flashman embodied the
physical bravery, self-reliance, school loyalty, patriotism and
``muscular Christianity'' that built the British Empire.
   Those ideals still are preached at Rugby, Eton, Harrow and other
``public schools,'' as Britain's fee-paying private schools are
paradoxically known, even as a more egalitarian age forces change on
the system.
   Morning chapel is obligatory at Rugby. Nearly all pupils study
Latin and, on Thursday afternoons, they must train as military
cadets or do community work in the town of Rugby.
   Shrouded in legend, beloved and reviled, public schools have
weathered the leveling forces of socialism, advance of women,
postwar revolution in education, permissiveness, drugs and recession.
   They now enjoy a revival as the breeding ground of the British
elite, educating the sons _ and increasingly the daughters _ of the
wealthy for fees of 7,000 pounds ($13,000) or more a year.
   Public schools always have been praised for the best and blamed
for the worst of British life.
   After the Duke of Wellingdon defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in
1815, perhaps the most famous quote about public schools was
attributed to him: ``The Battle of Waterloo was won the playing
fields of Eton.'' The Iron Duke also has been quoted as saying he
never said it.
   Novelist Henry Fielding, on the other hand, described public
schools as ``the nurseries of all vice and immorality.''
   Defenders see them as incubators of genius and say the
institutions must be elitist to do their job. To them, the schools
embody the finest British characteristics _ modesty, individualism,
gallantry and honesty.
   Detractors savage them as perpetuators of class division,
snobbery, sexual perversion, cruelty and sexism. Public schools, it
is claimed, turn Englishmen into homosexuals or Soviet agents, or
both, and make them adolescents for life.
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the socialist Labor Party, says public
schools are ``the very cement in the wall that divides British
society.''
   Moreover, the schools are accused of focusing so heavily on the
classics and humanities that Britain is afflicted by a debilitating
anti-science mentality.
   ``It's a closed society like an army barracks, a prison or a
monastery _ protective, cosseted and also unbelievably harsh,'' says
writer William Boyd, a graduate of rugged Gordonstoun in Scotland,
His play ``Good and Bad at Games'' portrays the fine line between
horrors and glories in public school life.
   ``If you fit in, you can enjoy levels of acclaim, fame, celebrity
at the age of 17, 18 that you cannot reproduce in your adult life,''
Boyd, 36, said in an interview. ``But if you're unpopular at these
schools, it's nightmarish.''
   From banking, politics and the professions to the military, the
diplomatic corps and civil service, public school graduates retain a
disproportionate influence.
   Although only 7 percent of British children are educated by the
2,500 fee-paying schools, they capture nearly half the places at
Oxford and Cambridge each year.
   Only a fraction go to very top schools like Eton or Rugby. Their
graduates, however, include Robert Walpole, Winston Churchill and 18
other prime ministers; such eminent foreigners as King Hussein of
Jordan and Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of independent
India; noted lawyers, writers, philosophers, scientists and
sportsmen, and more than half Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Cabinet.
   Mrs. Thatcher, a grocer's daughter, went to one of the
state-subsidized ``grammar schools,'' which lost their subsidies in
1976 and became either private or entirely state-financed.
   Many public schools approached bankruptcy in the 1960s and 1970s,
beset by hostile Labor governments, student revolts, high taxes and
intense rivalry from the grammar schools.
   Two decades later they flourish, with waiting lists longer than
ever. They rallied by rewriting curriculums with the stress on
examination results, subsidizing poorer students and making more
room for non-boarders.
   They ended such harsh traditions as initiation rites, beatings
and ``fagging'' _ 13-year-olds acting as servants to the
18-year-olds. Flogging was stopped two years ago.
   Girls are admitted to the sixth form, equivalent to 12th grade,
and dormitories have been divided into private rooms. Some masters
even call students by their first names.
   Isolation from parents, the opposite sex and social inferiors is
gone, and today new money predominates. Sixty percent of parents
with children at public schools did not attend them.
   ``Socially, the schools are as exclusive as ever but in every
other way they are much more in touch with the currents of
contemporary life,'' John Rae, former headmaster at London's elite
Westminster School, wrote in The Times.
   At Rugby, a montage of Victorian, Gothic, Tudor and modernistic
school buildings surround ``The Close,'' a rectangular sports field.
   A carved stone commemorates the first game of rugby in 1823, when
William Webb Ellis, ``with a fine disregard for the rules of
football as played in his time, first took the ball and ran with
it.''
   At lunch in Michell House, one of 15 boarding houses, 60 pupils
grouped by age stood stiffly as grace was mumbled quickly, then sat
down to a meal of sausages, green beans and potatoes and gravy.
   ``It's the cook's day off,'' a senior boy told a visitor in
apology.
   Rugby boys wear tweed jackets and dark trousers. Eton still
insists on tails and starched collars but its arch-rival Harrow
settles for tails on Sundays and formal occasions only. Winchester
requires academic gowns in classes.
   Classes are limited to 15 boys at Rugby and about 80 percent of
the graduates will attend universities, more than five times the
average of 15 percent for all British graduates of lower schools.
   Eighteen modern languages are offered, including Chinese and
Russian.
   In 1859, Rugby challenged the landed gentry's distaste for
technical education by pioneering science instruction. Half the
seniors now study science and six of the 17 science teachers have
doctorates.
   The school employs a full-time public relations officer and
publishes a glossy promotional brochure.
   Foreigners and non-boarders each make up 10 percent of Rugby's
pupils, and 20 percent of students are helped by an annual aid fund
of 400,000 pounds ($750,000). Under week-long exchanges with state
schools, students learn how the other half lives by sharing each
other's classrooms and homes.

   ``Joe was a fabulous swimmer. No one I ever knew looked as
graceful as he did in the water. He just had a hard time on land.''
   _ Nick Eaton, whose brother, Joe, died on a San Francisco
sidewalk last week after a sad life of alcholism and failed
opportunity.

   Joseph Emerson Eaton Jr., born to wealth and
privilege in Boston, met death as a homeless alcoholic, tossed
unconscious from a fast food restaurant to die alone on a cold
sidewalk in San Francisco's Tenderloin.
   Eaton was an unlikely member of the city's legion of street
people, and family riches couldn't overcome his love of vodka or the
despair he felt after losing his lover to AIDS a year ago.
   His crumpled, lifeless body became as invisible to dozens of
passersby in those chilly hours of early Saturday morning as the
hundreds of other huddled forms that line the city's streets and
crowd into doorways.
   Advocates for the homeless have seized upon Eaton's death at age
38 as a symbol of the homeless crisis and public callousness.
   ``If he had been a middle-class person at a restaurant anywhere
else in town and passed out, they'd have called for an ambulance, or
the cops if he was drunk,'' said the minister who discovered Eaton's
body. ``They wouldn't just throw him out onto the sidewalk and let
him lay there and die.''
   Eaton's lonely death has raised questions about society's
responsibility for the homeless, but his life was a story of sadness
and failed opportunity.
   A prep school graduate and the grandson of a Boston banker,
family members said Eaton's troubles began when he started drinking
at 13.
   After years of battling alcohol, Eaton's final tailspin began as
he was mourning the death of the man who had inspired him to forsake
the bottle.
   It ended when he collapsed over a bacon cheeseburger at a Carl's
Jr. restaurant around midnight Dec. 2. He died after a security
guard, thinking Eaton was drunk, dragged him outside into the
48-degree cold and left him in a misshapen pile.
   Almost five hours later, the Rev. Thomas Flower, an Eastern
Orthodox monk who feeds hundreds of homeless people from his van,
recognized Eaton and discovered he was dead. The exact cause of
death will not be known for at least a week, pending results of
toxicology tests.
   In an ironic twist to an already tragic story, the guard was
himself homeless before he was hired by the restaurant 3{ years ago.
   Eaton grew up the son of privilege in Duxbury, Mass., a
well-to-do suburb of Boston. His late grandfather, Charles Freedom
Eaton Jr., co-founded Investors Bank & Trust Co. His father, Joseph
Sr., is a retired business executive.
   But Eaton's alcoholism systematically destroyed whatever
stability his family's wealth provided, according to friends and
family.
   ``He was an alcoholic,'' said Eaton's older brother Nick, a
contractor in New Hampshire. ``He was also a person who was gay, and
I think that it took him a long time to come to grips with that and
to start feeling really good about himself.''
   Although Nick disputes it, some friends say Joe's homosexuality
was a source of family tension.
   ``The family had limitations on how much they could accept Joe
because of his homosexuality,'' said one friend, Stephen Irvine, 43,
of San Francisco.
   The family repeatedly paid Eaton's enrollment fees at some of the
nation's most expensive alcohol and drug rehabilitation programs,
but Eaton repeatedly fell off the wagon.
   Irvine, who last saw Eaton almost a year ago on the eve of his
beginning yet another treatment program, said his friend didn't
struggle with his drinking problem, but ``went right head first into
it.''
   When friends would intervene with his drinking, ``it was as
though he'd get just clear-headed enough to recognize his despair
and plunge out,'' said Irvine. ``Vodka. He really liked vodka.''
   Eaton's sponsor in Alcoholics Anonymous for six years said
Eaton's problems were not with his family but with himself.
   ``Sobriety is for people that want it,'' said Skip B., who
withheld his last name in compliance with AA tradition. ``I'm really
sorry it ended this way, but I can't say I'm surprised.''
   ``I like Joe as a person,'' Skip said later, lapsing into present
tense. ``He's a nice guy and I somehow felt that under all that
booze ... there was somebody trying to get out. I just figured that
someday maybe he'd get it.''
   Although Irvine and some of Eaton's acquaintances on the streets
accuse family members of using their wallets to say what their
hearts could not, others portray a man trapped in self-destruction,
refusing to take responsibility for his life.
   Eaton never went to college and worked as a chef and a florist
when he was sober. After some years in Denver, he came to San
Francisco in 1981. The next year, he was arrested on drug charges.
   Eaton's life turned around when he met Phillip Coleman through
AA. They became lovers and lived together for five years. Until
Coleman's death of AIDS in November 1987, Eaton stayed clean and
sober.
   Irvine said Eaton ``just adored and lived through Coleman.'' But
after his lover's death, Eaton ``had no real desire to go on. All
the life he'd known was dead. I think he was a passive suicide.''
   Eaton, who knew he had AIDS-related complex, spent a lot of time
drinking alone in the apartment the couple had shared, according to
Skip.
   He lost his job as a florist's driver. Finally, in late January,
Nick flew out, packed Eaton's belongings and enrolled him in a
$7,000, one-month program at St. Mary's Hospital in Minneapolis.
   When Eaton returned to San Francisco, he lived with Skip
rent-free for several months, but quickly returned to sporadic heavy
drinking.
   He asked his family if he could move back East. Nick agreed and
was readying a cabin on his property.
   But family members had agreed with Joe after the Minneapolis
treatment that if he came home, he should be sober _ and if he
started drinking again, he had to bear responsibility.
   ``He felt very strongly about that,'' said Nick, emphasizing that
his brother had not requested any assistance this time. ``I think he
was trying to prove himself. ... He was making an effort _ not that
night, I guess _ to pull it together.''
   ``I think he was having one last fling.''

   Eaton lost his home with Skip after passing out during a binge
and starting a minor fire with a lit cigarette. The landlord ordered
him out, and Skip, who said he ``doesn't give up on people,'' had to
comply.
   On Nov. 13, the day Skip turned him out, Eaton landed in an
intensive care unit in a coma, with a blood-alcohol level experts
said could have killed him.
   ``The last I heard from him was Friday (hours before his death)
when he called to see if his welfare check had arrived,'' said Skip.
   That same day he called Nick to ask if the family would pay for
one more treatment program. Nick promised they would.
   Compared to many of the city's thousands of homeless, Eaton had a
short life on the streets. Yet his death has refocused attention on
the problem and the inadequacy of support programs.
   ``These are our people,'' said Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of
Glide Memorial United Methodist Church and a frequent spokesman for
the city's underpriviliged. ``We've got to make sure our people
don't need to go through serious misery from year to year before
something is done.''
   John Crew, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said
Eaton's death is ``another tragic example of how this society has
not dealt with the fundamental social and health issues of
homelessness.''
   A spokesman for the restaurant that put Eaton on the street said
the eatery had no choice.
   ``If somebody is obviously passed out drunk, we're not going to
have people sleeping in our restaurant. No one is,'' said Carl's Jr.
spokesman Paul Mitchell. He said the same thing takes place ``one,
two or three times a night.''
   The Eaton family plans no legal action against the restaurant or
the guard who ejected Joe. As the man who discovered Eaton's body
said at an informal street memorial service Tuesday, the time for
anger is past.
   ``It is time for reconciliation,'' said Flower. ``The best
memorial for Joseph Eaton is reconciliation.''
   One of the mourners was Barry Tompkins, who used to be homeless.
He said it is easy to become anonymous living on the streets.
   ``People just walk by,'' he said. ``I don't think anybody knew he
was wealthy. Nobody really cared. You sort of lose your identity. ...
   ``When you live like this, you can get caught,'' said Tompkins.
``It's not easy to break out. You've got to have dreams. You've got
to have something to pull yourself out.''

   A top Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader has
turned state's evidence in a criminal fraud probe of the Wall Street
giant and its high-yield bond financier Michael Milken, but sources
familiar with the case say the impact of the defection remained
unclear.
   The sources, who spoke Wednesday on condition they not be

of any wrongdoing in court, contradicting press accounts that
suggested he had wavered and even entered into preliminary
discussions with prosecutors about a possible guilty plea.
   They also said the Drexel-Milken battery of defense lawyers had

   Two flashy domestic models top Allstate
Insurance Co.'s annual list of automobile insurance rates, but the
insurer says other U.S.-made models dominate the lower end of the
rate scale.
   The Chevrolet Camaro IROC-Z28 and the Pontiac Firebird TransAm _
both made by General Motors Corp. _ are being charged 100 percent to
140 percent higher than standard rate levels for collision and
comprehensive coverages, according to the survey released Wednesday
of 1987 and 1988 models of foreign and domestic cars.
   Forty-three of the 49 cars being charged 10 percent to 40 percent
less than standard rates were domestic models, the report said.

   Americans took out $3.56 billion more in
consumer debt than they paid off in October, reflecting a rebound in
consumer spending, the government says.
   The Federal Reserve said Wednesday the October increase followed
a tiny $2 million rise in debt during September, the smallest change
in six years. Consumer credit fell by $81 million in October 1982 at
the bottom of the last recession.

<HEAD>Gorbachev's Speech Gets Mixed Market Reaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail Gorbachev's peacemaking efforts got a mixed reaction in
the financial markets, strengthening the dollar, depressing gold and
causing shrugs of indifference among stock and bond traders, who
dismissed the Soviet leader's remarks as old news.
   Gorbachev told the United Nations on Wednesday the Soviet Union
would cut troop strength by half a million and reduce the number of
conventional arms. Speculation on Tuesday that he would make an
announcement along those lines already had pushed up stock and bond
prices.
   But in the currency markets, traders reacted enthusiastically to
Gorbachev's speech and bid the dollar higher against major
currencies.
   They reasoned that reduced Soviet military spending would give
George Bush's incoming administration a greater chance of cutting
this country's staggering budget deficit, which many economists
consider a long-term threat to the dollar's value and the economy in
general.
   ``All of a sudden when the Gorby stuff came out, people said gee,
maybe Bush will have flexibility to do some budget cutting,'' said
James Hohorst, director of foreign exchange at Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co. in New York. ``This is leading to a reassessment of the
dollar.''
   Prospects of a peaceful world apparently were too much for the
gold market, however, and traders dumped bullion aggressively. Gold
historically has been considered a safe-haven investment during
times of international tension. Prices dropped by as much as $4 an
ounce in New York to the $422.50 level.
   In the bond market prices retreated, largely because of traders
taking profits from the rally on Tuesday, when speculation about
Gorbachev's peace speech incited the biggest rally in three months.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond lost ] point, or
about $3.75 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
inversely to price and often indicates broader interest rate trends,
rose to 8.97 percent from 8.92 percent late Tuesday.
   On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average, which shot up
more than 25 points Tuesday in a spillover from the bond market
rally, added 4.27 points to close at 2,153.63, reflecting a muted
reaction to Gorbachev's speech.
   In other economic news Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said
Americans took out $3.56 billion more in consumer debt than they
paid off in October, reflecting what some analysts called a rebound
in consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall
economic activity.

   Concern about crude oil supplies has helped push
energy futures mostly higher.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled
28 cents higher Wednesday at $15.74 a barrel, after rising 12 cents
on Tuesday. Other contract months also gained ground.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange
Wednesday, the January contract for wholesale home heating oil
closed 0.29 cent higher at 48.89 cents a gallon. The contract had
risen 0.24 cent in Tuesday's session.
   But January unleaded gasoline, which lost 0.09 cent on Tuesday,
fell another 0.59 cent to 43.76 cents Wednesday.
   William Byers, senior energy analyst for Bear, Stearns & Co.,
attributed the higher prices to lower-than-expected crude oil supply
figures released late Tuesday in the American Petroleum Institute's
weekly report.
   ``The drop in crude stocks was more than expected,'' Byers said.

<HEAD>Fed Reports Active Intervention During August-October Period</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States spent more than $2 billion to
hold down the dollar's value in foreign-exchange trading during
August and September, but it started to support the currency the
following month, a Federal Reserve report shows.
   The latest quarterly foreign-exchange report issued Wednesday by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the Fed and the Treasury
Department sold $2.136 billion for the equivalent West German marks
several times between Aug. 5 and Sept. 26.
   On Oct. 31 both agencies sold $200 million in Japanese yen to buy
dollars, the report said.
   Sam Y. Cross, an executive vice president of the New York Fed,
said the operations were designed to maintain market stability and
generally were ``coordinated'' among the central banks of the
so-called Group of Seven nations. Besides the United States, the G-7
includes Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada.
   The G-7 has agreed to work together to stabilize the currency
markets, and reinforced those efforts at a special meeting in late
September.
   ``Some of them (intervention operations) ... occurred at the same
time,'' but other times the U.S. government acted alone after
notifying its major trading partners, Cross told a news briefing
Wednesday.
   Currency traders are often keenly aware of the activities of
central banks in the open markets. The Fed's policy, however, is to
comment only well after the fact.
   Cross declined to specify the exact amount of the foreign banks'
intervention during the August-October period, saying it was up to
them to do so.
   The dollar-selling operations by the Fed and the Treasury came as
the U.S. currency was reaching its peak for the year, especially
against the mark, where it traded at a high of 1.9230 marks on Aug.
22. The dollar also was close to the 135-yen level during that time.
   Still, the dollar ended the August-October period 5.5 percent
lower in value against the yen and 5 percent lower against the mark,
compared with the beginning of the period, as sentiment toward the
currency changed course, according to the New York Fed. Lately it
has been trading in the markets at around 1.75 marks and 122 yen.
   The dollar's strength had come amid signs of an improving U.S.
trade deficit, a growing economy and rising interest rates,
particularly in the early weeks of the Fed's latest reporting period.
   On Aug. 9, the Fed signaled its desire to cool down the economy
and prevent inflation from accelerating by raising its discount
rate, or the interest charged on loans to member banks.
   The heaviest intervention occurred between Aug. 5 and Aug. 23,
when the government bought $1.806 billion worth of marks, the Fed
report said. The government also bought $230 million of marks
between Sept. 14 and Sept. 22, and $100 million of marks on Sept.
26, it said.
   The Oct. 30 purchase of $200 million with yen was the only effort
during the period to support the dollar, the report said.
   In the previous three-month period, from May to June, U.S.
intervention totaled $2.93 billion, solely through the sale of marks
to resist upward pressure on the dollar.
   Cross said sentiment toward the dollar had turned decidedly
bearish in October, after central banks overseas started raising
their interest rates and as the U.S. economy was showing signs of
slowing down. Falling oil prices also helped bring interest rates
down in the United States.
   The dollar reached its highest point of the decade in February
1985. It declined slightly until September 1985, when G-7 leaders
agreed to lower its value to help narrow the U.S. trade gap and
stave off protectionist sentiment in Congress.
   The dollar touched bottom in the final days of 1987 before
rebounding sharply at the beginning of 1988. It is now trading in a
fairly narrow range.

<HEAD>Senior Trader Strikes Deal; Milken Said Determined Not to
Capitulate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader has
decided to cooperate in the government's criminal fraud probe of the
Wall Street giant and its high-yield bond financier Michael Milken,
but the impact of the defection is unclear and Milken remains
determined to prove his innocence in court.
   Sources familiar with the Drexel case said Wednesday that defense
lawyers had expected the plea bargain by Cary Maultasch, a trader
who had been under especially heavy pressure by federal prosecutors
to capitulate because he had been threatened with numerous
indictments.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, also
said Milken was adamant about exonerating himself of any wrongdoing,
contradicting press accounts that suggested he had wavered and even
entered into preliminary discussions with prosecutors about a
possible guilty plea.
   The defense was further said to believe Maultasch's disclosures
would not substantially damage Drexel or Milken, who have been under
intense investigation for more than two years but have maintained
they are innocent.
   News of the Maultasch defection coincided with rampant
speculation that a decisive turning point was near in the protracted
legal travails of Drexel, one of the nation's leading investment
firms and a pioneer in the market for high-yield, high-risk
securities commonly called ``junk bonds.''
   Contrary to Milken's position, Drexel has expressed interest in
reaching a settlement with the government over as-yet unfiled
criminal securities fraud charges, although any settlement would
almost certainly involve a guilty plea and a heavy fine, possibly in
the hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Negotiations have taken place, but one source said both sides
remained substantially far apart as of Wednesday.
   It was unclear what new evidence could be provided by Maultasch,
who struck a deal Tuesday with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office
and the Securities and Exchange Commission for his cooperation. In
exchange, it is expected that he will not face prosecution on any
serious charges.
   SEC aides and Bruce Baird, the assistant U.S. attorney for
securities and commodities fraud, would not comment on the Maultasch
development in accordance with their policy of official silence on
pending investigations.
   Aubrey Harwell, a Maultasch attorney, was out of his office and
did not return telephone calls for comment. Drexel spokesman Steven
Anreder declined to comment.
   Drexel, Milken, Maultasch and two other senior aides at the firm
were accused by the SEC in a civil complaint filed three months ago
of conspiring with now-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky to
commit a litany of frauds ranging from insider trading to stock
manipulation.
   A Manhattan federal grand jury has been expected to indict the
defendants on criminal charges that would likely include
racketeering, which carries enormous penalties.
   Some sources said that indictment was nearly filed last week but
prosecutors delayed it, perhaps as a pressure tactic to extract
guilty pleas from the defendants.
   An underlying problem facing prosecutors has been their one key
witness, Boesky, an admitted doublecrosser and liar who settled the
biggest insider trading case in history by paying the SEC a record
$100 million fine in 1986.
   Without additional witnesses to corroborate Boesky's claims, the
government's case faces serious attack by the Drexel-Milken defense
team, comprised of some of the best-paid legal talent in the country.
   On its surface, the Maultasch defection was seen by some
attorneys as possibly bolstering the government's case and
encouraging others threatened with indictment to come forth to
cooperate.
   But others questioned why the government waited so long to strike
a deal with Maultasch, suggesting it was largely a pressure device
that was deliberately leaked to the press to amplify its effect.
   Federal prosecutors also have been seeking cooperation for the
Drexel investigation from partners in a much smaller firm, Princeton
Newport Partners, who were indicted on tax fraud and racketeering
charges in August.
   Lawyers for the Princeton Newport defendants announced Wednesday
that the partnership had been dissolved, blaming the move on the
uncertainties raised by what they called prosecutor threats to file
additional charges.
   Baird declined to comment on their accusation.

   A full-size luxury Ford sedan had the
lowest insurance rates while two flashy sports coupes by General
Motors Corp. had the highest on Allstate Insurance Co.'s annual list.
   Ford's LTD Crown Victoria costs 35 percent to 50 percent less to
insure than the standard rate, while Chevy's Camaro IROC-Z28 and the
Pontiac Firebird TransAm are being charged 100 percent to 140
percent higher than standard rate levels for collision and
comprehensive coverages, Allstate said.
   The cars are among the automobiles on Allstate's list of
insurance rates for 1987 and 1988 models of 119 foreign and domestic
cars.
   ``One of the things that we have found is that American-made cars
seem to be getting better treatment than foreign cars,'' Allstate
Vice President Mike LaMonica said Wednesday, attributing the
difference to the cost of repair and parts, and to theft records.
   Forty-three of the 49 cars being charged 10 percent to 40 percent
less than standard rates were domestic models.
   Allstate rated the Porsche 944 model and Chrysler's Conquest as
the second-most expensive to insure, charging drivers of those cars
insurance rates 60 percent to 100 percent higher than standard rates.
   The 1988 rating guide is based on the company's own loss
experience for the collision and comprehensive portions of its auto
policies, the Northbrook-based insurer said.
   The cost of insuring a particular model is generally based on its
price when new, LaMonica said.
   But the ``loss experience,'' or the amount Allstate has paid out
in claims for that model over time, affects the insurance rate, he
said.
   In its survey, Allstate assigned each car a standard rate based
on the car's price when new, and a hypothetical suburban Chicago
residence for the driver.
   The standard annual rate for the LTD Crown Victoria had been
$550, but was reduced to $360 based on claims filed with Allstate
for that model, LaMonica said.
   The TransAm initially was given a standard rate of $550, but that
rose to $1,296 based on Allstate's claim record for the car, he said.
   Pontiac spokesman Bill O'Neill blamed the TransAm's high
insurance costs on the car's theft rate and its popularity with
younger, mostly male drivers.
   ``The Firebird series, especially the TransAm has ... among the
highest theft rates in the country,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   ``It is a performance-oriented machine ... this is prime pickings
for people who like to steal automobiles,'' O'Neill said.
   But he said the sports car's theft rate has dropped by about 50
percent since last year, when the automaker began equipping each car
with a special ignition key. Without the key, the car won't start
for three minutes _ about the time it takes to steal a car.
   Susan Kane, a spokeswoman for Chevrolet, said all 1989 Camaros
would also be equipped with the ``Pass Key,'' to help eliminate
theft problems, and possibly to lower insurance rates for the sports
car.
   In releasing its survey, Allstate denied claims by critics who
say insurance companies aren't doing enough to keep their prices
down.
   ``Those critics are ignoring the fact that our research into
repairability has led to our drive for stronger bumpers and cars
that are easier and cheaper to repair,'' said Ray Kiefer, president
of Allstate's Personal Property and Casualty unit. ``We share that
information with auto manufacturers.''
   LaMonica said Allstate planned to give its rate results to
manufacturers ``to encourage them to make better designs'' and to
``give customers an opportunity save insurance dollars.''

<HEAD>Consumers Boost Debt by $3.5 Billion in October</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reflecting a rebound in consumer spending,
Americans took out $3.56 billion more in consumer debt than they
paid off in October, the government has reported.
   The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the October increase
followed a tiny $2 million rise in debt during September, the
smallest change in six years. Consumer credit fell by $81 million in
October 1982 at the bottom of the last recession.
   The October advance, which translated into credit growth at an
annual rate of 6.5 percent, was still down from the 8.75 percent
annual rate of growth recorded over the first nine months of the
year.
   Still, analysts said they believed consumer spending was
strengthening after a period of sluggishness. They noted that retail
sales shot up 0.9 percent in October, the biggest gain in seven
months.
   ``The latest numbers suggest that consumers are a little more
optimistic about buying,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington
consulting firm. ``I think they are not fighting higher prices as
much as they had in the past.''
   Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of overall economic
activity. Newfound strength in the consumer sector has prompted some
analysts to boost their projections for growth in the current
October-December quarter.
   The $2 million advance for September represented a sharp revision
from the original report a month ago that had put the rise in
consumer debt at $1.88 billion. Fed officials said new data showing
weaker activity in car sales accounted for much of the change.
   The October increase was the strongest since a $5.32 billion rise
in August.
   Auto loans rose by $1.32 billion in October after falling by $779
million in September. The poor showing in September was blamed on an
absence of sales incentive programs that have boosted demand at the
end of previous model years.
   The category that includes credit card debt rose by $2.17
billion, up from a $1.1 billion September increase.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate edged up
by $178 million in October. They had declined by $158 million in
September.
   Loans for mobile homes fell for the second straight month,
declining by $101 million after a drop of $169 million in September.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at a seasonally
adjusted $656.88 billion in October. Total consumer debt was 8.2
percent higher than a year earlier.

<HEAD>S&L Capital Up for Third Straight Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continued efforts by government regulators to
close or rescue failed institutions brought an increase in savings
and loan industry capital in October for the third consecutive
month, the government has reported.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Wednesday that capital _
representing the difference between loans and other assets and
savers' deposits and other liabilities _ edged up by $507 million in
October following advances of $2.47 billion September and $6.11
bilion in August.
   Through the first 10 months of the year, S&L capital has risen by
$2.94 billion, compared with a loss of $3.07 billion in the same
period of 1987.
   The bank board began increasing the pace of S&L rescues in
mid-August. Rescues in effect wipe out the red ink of the failed
institutions by transferring it to the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., the agency that insures deposits up to $100,000.
   The agency has dealt with more than 150 troubled institutions so
far this year.
   Meanwhile, deposits increased by $390 million in October,
representing the first net increase in deposits since April.
   The October net increase in deposits represented a sharp contrast
to net withdrawals of $2 billion in September. A year earlier, there
was a much larger deposit increase of $6.17 billion, when investors
sought a safe haven for their money after the October 1987 stock
market crash.
   The assets of federally insured S&Ls, made up primarily of loans,
grew at an annual rate of 9.5 percent in October, down from an 11
percent growth rate in September.
   Abouth three-fourths of the asset growth in October reflected a
$7.8 billion increase in mortgage holdings, including purchases of
mortgage-backed securities. This followed a September increase of
$4.7 billion.

   General Motors Corp. is recalling about 85,000
Pontiac LeMans cars and about 4,000 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and
Pontiac Grand Prix models for faulty safety belt buckles and parking
brake cables.
   But the automaker said Wednesday it is unaware of any accidents
or injuries caused by the defects, which have surfaced on some 1988
models equipped with manual transmissions.
   On the LeMans vehicles, seat belt buckles may appear to be
latched when they are not, GM said.
   On some Cutlass Supreme and Grand Prix cars, the parking brake
may not work because the cable is improperly connected.
   Dealers will make inspections and repairs free of charge to car

<HEAD>Securities Firm To Liquidate Amid Racketeering Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The securities firm Princeton-Newport
Partners says it plans to liquidate amid government racketeering
charges.
   The company said Wednesday that business has been severely hurt
after five of its partners were indicted in August in connection
with an alleged tax-fraud scheme. A former trader from Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. also was named in the government suit.
   The case marks the first time that securities executives have
been charged under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law, known as RICO.
   ``The government has succeeded in destroying Princeton-Newport,''
said Paul Grand, a New York attorney for one of the indicted
officials.
   On Monday many of the firm's investors withdrew their capital.
   The indictment accuses the six of a multimillion-dollar mail and
wire fraud conspiracy to make false stock trades to create phony
long-term capital gains and short-term capital losses for
Princeton-Newport.

<TEXT>
   Taiwan's economy is expected to expand by 7
percent in 1989, roughly the same as this year's growth, the
government said Thursday.
   The rate would be well below the 11 percent growth recorded in
1987.
   Vincent Siew, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, said inflation could pose a serious problem next
year and that the United States was expected to continue pressuring
Taiwan to reduce its massive trade surplus.
   Under the 1989 economic plan, Taiwan's total trade surplus next
year is expected to fall to $10 billion from the $11.9 billion
projected for this year, he said. Taiwan had a record trade surplus
of $19 billion in 1987.

<HEAD>Award-Winning Ad Man To Leave Agency He Helped Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom McElligott, award-winning creator of
nationally known advertising, plans to leave Fallon McElligott, the
ad agency he helped found more than seven years ago.
   McElligott, 45, a founding partner, vice president and creative
director of the agency, said Wednesday he is leaving because of
disagreements over the agency's creative direction, not for personal
reasons.
   ``I've had strong opinions since the day the agency was opened
about creative focus,'' McElligott said. ``I'm currently in
substantial disagreement'' with the agency's other managers. He
declined to elaborate.
   However, agency spokeswoman Mary Weber said McElligott had
expressed an interest in leaving for personal reasons.
   ``This will not affect the well-being of our employees or the
quality of our creative product,'' she said.
   Fallon McElligott was founded in 1981. In 1986, a majority stake
was sold to Scali McCabe Sloves, a New York-based agency. Fallon
McElligott employs about 125 people. Its 1987 billings were $142
million.
   McElligott said his decision to leave the firm had nothing to do
with a series of recent controversies. Agency officials were widely
criticized late last year after McElligott and another employee sent
insulting letters to a Mankato woman who complained that one ad was
sexist. The men later apologized, but the agency has since lost
several large accounts, including US West Inc.
   Among clients who remain are Federal Express Corp., Porsche USA
and Timex Corp.
   McElligott said he plans to stay in the Twin Cities and wants to
remain in advertising.

<HEAD>Farley Extends Bid for Pepperell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farley Inc. today extended for a third time its
$1.4 billion unsolicited tender offer for Georgia-based textiles
maker West Point-Pepperell Inc., this time to midnight EST next
Wednesday.
   The $48-a-share offer was to expire at midnight Wednesday of this
week.
   Farley, a Chicago-based maker of Fruit of the Loom underwear and
several other well-known clothing brands, said 13.7 million shares
of Pepperell's common stock had been tendered by stockholders.
   Those shares, together with the shares already owned by Farley,
represent about 56.3 percent of Pepperell's common shares, Farley
said.
   Farley's offer is contingent on getting Pepperell's ``poison
pill'' shareholder rights plan overturned in court. The 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has scheduled a hearing on the
matter for the week of Jan. 9.
   Farley Chairman William Farley said today he is ``confident of a
successful conclusion'' to his bid for Pepperell, which is based in
West Point, Ga., and whose products include Gold Toe socks.
   On Monday, Pepperell said it was offering early retirement to
more than 800 employees. On Wednesday, the company said it had
notified about 400 employees of its Cluett, Peabody & Co. plant in
Troy, N.Y., that it may shut down that operation.
   Farley contrasted those cutbacks with its own announcement that
it has created 9,000 jobs at Fruit of the Loom since it acquired the
company in 1985.
   ``Our emphasis at Fruit of the Loom is on job creation,'' the
company said today. ``We believe Pepperell and Fruit of the Loom
would make a great team and that, working together, we would be
better able to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive
industry and create more jobs.''
   Pepperell officials have disputed Farley's stated intentions,
underscoring a statement by Farley in a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing that he might consider selling some Pepperell
divisions if he succeeds in acquiring the company.

   From vodka to rifles to tractors to furs, the
fruits of the Soviet economy were displayed today in an
unprecedented trade show left somewhat less glittering by the
absence of its chief sponsor, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Soviet leader, who was to open the exhibit, decided instead
to cut short his New York visit and fly back to Moscow today because
of an earthquake that devastated three southern Soviet republics,
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said at a news conference
late Wednesday.
   Viktor Kamentsev, a deputy Soviet premier, opened the show along
with C. William Verity, the U.S. secretary of commerce.
   Kamentsev urged a lowering of trade barriers between the United
States and the Soviet Union and said his country was eager to
increase its exports here. He then rushed from the hall to catch a
plane to Moscow.
   Verity, congratulating the Soviets for Gorbachev's
``electrifying'' United Nations speech, also hailed the improvement
in trade between the two nations.
   ``We believe this is an important step in building long-term,
mutually beneficial, non-strategic trade between the United States
and the Soviet Union,'' Verity said.
   Despite Gorbachev's no-show, Soviet sponsors hope the show _ an
outgrowth of his policy of perestroika, or restructuring _ will mark
a major turning point in trade relations between the world's two
largest economies. The show is scheduled to end Dec. 20.
   By air and by sea, the Soviets have shipped hundreds of tons of
products to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in hopes of luring
U.S. dollars.
   ``I think the Soviets are saying that they are looking at the
Americans as a most-favored-nation trading partner,'' said David
Wolstenholme, whose American marketing firm has spent more than a
year putting together the show. ``You really only do this to someone
you want to impress.''
   But some U.S. trade experts say the Soviet Union is likely to
remain among the most minor of American trading partners, in part
because the Soviets lack the products that Americans want and the
money to buy what Americans have.
   ``I do not believe that significant sales will result,'' said Val
Zabijaka, an economist on the Soviet desk at the U.S. Commerce
Department. ``I may be proven wrong.''
   By Wolstenholme's reckoning, the Soviets are spending more than
$2 million to prove the nay sayers wrong, including $700,000 in
advertising for the show.
   ``We consider it to be very important,'' said Bagrat Aroutiounov,
the Soviet director of overseas exhibitions. He said the event is
the first ``pure commercial'' trade show ever mounted by the Soviet
Union in this country.
   Previous trade shows had primarily political aims, Aroutiounov
said, and were intended to show off the advantages of a
state-controlled economy. This year's show has a single, thoroughly
capitalist goal: profit.
   Furthermore, Aroutiounov said, this will be the first time that a
Soviet trade fair has been financed by the participants _
cooperatives, foreign trade organizations and enterprises _ and not
the government.
   The show, officially titled the Soviet Export Goods Exhibition,
initially was scheduled to begin Dec. 14, but was hastily
rescheduled to Dec. 8 to coincide with Gorbachev's visit to New York.
   Forty-eight participants will display approximately 4,500
products, including tractors, toys, computer programs, jewelry,
cars, bicycles, vodka and hunting rifles. The Soviet House of
Fashion Design will present ``fabulous Russian furs,'' as well as
``jackets and suits inspired by the Soviet military uniform.''
   In addition, some U.S. companies have rented booths to show off
the benefits of their business ties with the Soviet Union. The
Soviets are looking not only for buyers, Wolstenholme said, but for
American companies willing to take part in joint business ventures.
   ``I think Mr. Gorbachev himself said that the only limit is the
creativity of the American businessman,'' he said.
   But other observers see tougher barriers to improvements in
U.S.-Soviet trade. One limit is the Soviet shortage of hard currency.
   Since the ruble cannot be converted into Western currencies, the
Soviets must pay for American goods and services with gold or
Western currency. Given the Soviets' trade imbalance with the West,
the policy has built-in limitations.
   Some have speculated that Soviet economists would propose plans
at the fair for making the ruble convertible. Aroutiounov said he
expected the process would take ``two or three years, maybe longer.''
   But U.S. officials scoff at such suggestions. ``You probably
believe in Santa Claus, too,'' Zabijaka said in reference to the
Soviet proposals.
   According to Commerce Department figures, the Soviet Union
exported $500 million worth of products to the United States last
year and imported $1.5 billion worth of American goods, including
$900 million worth of grain.
   That represents a sharp drop from the peak year of
Soviet-American trade, 1979, when the Soviets imported $3.6 billion
in U.S. goods and exported $900 million to the U.S.
   Those levels dropped sharply when the U.S. imposed a limited
grain embargo in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and
sharply reduced purchases of Soviet goods.

   Grain and soybean futures opened sharply higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade on rumors, later denied, that
the devastating earthquake in Soviet Armenia had damaged two nuclear
power plants.
   ``The rumors of nuclear involvement have now largely been
discounted and the market is coming back to realize that although
the loss of life is tragic, the possibility of agricultural damage
is pretty remote,'' said Richard Feltes, director of commodities
research with Refco Inc., a large, Chicago-based futures brokerage
house.
   Soybean futures also were supported by reports that the South
American soybean belt had received less rain overnight than traders
had expected, analysts said.
   Wheat futures got an additional boost from the Agriculture
Department's announcement late Wednesday that it had targeted China
for 1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   In early trading, wheat was 3\ cents to 4 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.27 a bushel; corn was 1\
cents to 4} cents higher with December at $2.60 a bushel; oats were
2{ cents to 4 cents higher with March at $2.14 a bushel; soybeans
were 8 cents to 11 cents higher with January at $7.79 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .40 cent lower with December at
71.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to .38 cent lower
with January at 82.05 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .25 cent
lower with December at 40.87 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.47 cent lower to .18 cent higher with February at 42.57 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. said Thursday it
completed its $12.9 billion acquisition of Kraft Inc. in a deal that
makes the food and tobacco giant the world's largest consumer
products company.
   The size of the buyout ranks only behind Chevron Corp.'s $13.4
billion acquisition of Gulf Oil Corp. in 1984 and RJR Nabisco Inc.'s
impending $24.5 billion purchase by the investment firm Kolhlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co.
   Philip Morris said its buyout of Kraft was completed on
Wednesday, five days after the closing of its $106-a-share tender
offer under which Kraft shareholders tendered more than 98 percent
of the company's outstanding shares.
   As a result of the transaction, Kraft shares that were not
tendered under terms of the offer were converted into the right to
receive $106 in cash.
   Philip Morris, whose products include Marlboro cigarettes, Miller
beer, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O desserts and Post cereals, will
be boosting its revenue by about a third as a result of the deal,
vaulting ahead of Unilever NV as the world's biggest consumer
products concern. Philip Morris had $27.7 billion in revenue in
1987, and Unilever had nearly $31 billion in sales.
   Kraft, based in Glenview, Ill., had revenue of about $9.9 billion
in 1987 and makes products such as Miracle Whip salad dressing,
Velveeta cheese, Parkay margarine and Breyers ice cream.
   Kraft stock was trading at $60.12{ a share when Philip Morris
launched an unsolicited tender offer at $90 a share in mid-October.
Kraft management rejected the offer as inadquate and proposed a
recpaitalization, but by the end of the month had agreed on the
takeover at $106 a share.

<TEXT>
   Barry Minkow was portrayed as a ``big
spender'' by a prosecutor who said the onetime carpet-cleaning king
was motivated to defraud investors of millions of dollars not by
threats but by his desire to live the good life.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger, during his rebuttal
arguments Wednesday, portrayed Minkow as someone who committed fraud
for his own personal gain.
   ``He loved the high life. He was motivated not by threats. He was
motivated by his own personal desires,'' said Asperger. ``Barry
Minkow was doing it for himself.''
   Minkow, on trial on fraud charges, has testified that he bilked
investors out of millions of dollars but did so only because
mobsters had taken over his ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning company and
were threatening his life.
   The jury was scheduled to receive instructions today, beginning
deliberations afterward.
   Minkow is charged with 57 counts of securities, credit-card and
mail fraud. The government contends major banks and securities firms
lost millions of dollars along with individual investors as a result
of Minkow's alleged scheme.
   During his closing arguments earlier Wednesday, Minkow's attorney
accused the government of engineering a massive cover-up of its
failure to short circuit the $15 million ZZZZ Best stock fraud.
   Attorney David Kenner said the FBI improperly dropped a probe of
Minkow's possible mob victimization in 1986 before his company hit
Wall Street.
   ``I think the government made a mistake,'' said Kenner. ``They
didn't do anything.''
   Minkow, who launched his carpet-cleaning business at 16 in his
parents' garage, became familiar to millions of Californians through
his television ads and talk show appearances.
   But he admitted during the four-month trial that his business was
``86 percent fraud.'' He had told investors that ZZZZ Best was
making a fortune restoring fire and water damaged buildings when no
such jobs existed.

<HEAD>High Court Blocks Joint GEC-Siemens Bid For Plessey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The High Court on Thursday temporarily blocked
General Electric Co. PLC and Siemens AG from proceeding with their
joint 1.7 billion-pound, or $3.1 billion, bid for the British
electronics company Plessey Co. PLC.
   The court granted the injunction on the grounds that the
GEC-Siemens bid violates the competition rules in the Treaty of
Rome, the founding charter of the European Community, Plessey said.
   The court injunction will remain in force until Monday, when a
full hearing will take place in the High Court.
   GEC, which has no ties with the similarly named American company,
had no immediate comment, said spokesman Peter Gillibrand. Neither
did Siemens, spokesman Rod Tucker said.
   Plessey sai opportunity
to let FmHA know how they want to handle their debt under the new
law. If a farmer does not respond within the 45-day period after
receiving the notice, the agency can begin collection proceedings,
including foreclosure and forced liquidation.
   O'Neill said another point of misunderstanding is the manner in
which local FmHA offices have been carrying some of the borrowers on
agency books. For example, he said, some offices may not be
including those whose overdue accounts have been ``accelerated,'' or
put into the foreclosure or forced-sale pipeline.
   The 1987 law also changed the definition of a borrower to include
anyone who owes FmHA money. So all those past-due loans in
acceleration _ and even those where the borrower is no longer
farming _ are included in the list of delinquencies.
   ``Anytime you start playing with numbers, it's difficult at
best,'' O'Neill said.

   The department's effort to identify National Bicentennial Farms
was undertaken last year as part of the 200th anniversary of the
signing of the U.S. Constitution.
   Assistant Secretary Wilmer D. Mizell said the farms located so
far are in 16 states, mostly along the East Coast. The program was
led by state Food and Agriculture Councils, which are made up of
USDA officials at the state level.
   Each of the farms located has been given a certificate signed by
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng ``to acknowledge the vital
contribution of farm families to the growth and strength of this
great nation.''
   Also, the families have been given metal signs to display in
front of their homes, identifying them in red, white and blue as
bicentennial farms.
   Mizell said Wednesday that a total of about 700 farms is expected
to be located. Families wishing to submit applications may contact
state and local USDA and extension offices for more information.
   The oldest farm discovered dates back to 1632 when apprentice
barrelmaker John Tuttle survived a shipwreck off the coast of Maine
and found his way to Dover, Conn., to claim 15 acres granted him by
Charles I, then king of England.
   His decendant, Hugh Tuttle, and Hugh's three children still own
the farm, an enterprise that includes a roadside store.
   As of Nov. 1, bicentennial farms identified by state included:
Connecticut, 36; Delaware, 16; Georgia, 24; Louisiana, two;
Maryland, 33; Maine, 30; Massachusetts, 39; New Hampshire, 47; New
Jersey, 17; New York, 17; North Carolina, 31; Pennsylvania, 95;
Rhode Island, 10; South Carolina, 88; Virginia, about 50; and West
Virginia, 38.

   About $106 million is going out to states as
their final share of national forest sales receipts this year, the
Agriculture Department said.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said Wednesday the money is in
addition to a preliminary payment of $212 million which went to
states on Sept. 27, bringing the total for the fiscal year that
ended Sept. 30 to more than $318 million.
   By law, 25 percent of the revenues collected by the Agriculture
Department agency for the sale of timber and other use of national
forest resources must be returned to the states where the forests
are located. Actual receipts in fiscal 1988 totaled approximately
$1.26 billion.
   The states are required to use the funds for schools and roads.

<HEAD>TW Services Asks Stockholders To Reject Coniston Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TW Services Inc. recommended again Thursday that
its stockholders reject a $1.14 billion takeover offer by Coniston
Partners, calling the bid for the food services company too low.
   TW Services also urged shareholders to withdraw any shares
already tendered in the bid, which Coniston has amended to $29 a
share in cash for the 81 percent of the company it does not already
own.
   The tender offer is scheduled to expire Tuesday.
   In a letter to Coniston, TW Services Chairman Frank L. Salizzoni
called the offer illusory because it is conditioned on support from
TW's management for a merger agreement and on the withdrawal of TW
Services' ``poison pill'' anti-takeover defense.
   ``Your `offer' continues to be merely an invitation to enter into
merger negotiations with you,'' Salizzoni said. ``You are already
aware of the board's lack of interest in entering into
negotiations.''
   Salizzoni said the board concluded the offer was too low.
   Keith R. Gollust, a Coniston partner, responded: ``If Frank
Salizzoni or the board of directors really believes the offer is
illusory then we challenge them to redeem the posion pill. We are in
a position to drop all the other conditions and purchase the
shares.''
   Coniston, a New York-based investment firm that already owns
about 9.3 million of TW Services' 48.6 million shares, launched a
tender offer for 15.75 million shares in late October.
   Coniston announced Nov. 29 that nearly 30.2 million shares had
been tendered, which would give it almost 82 percent of TW Services'
outstanding shares. Coniston said it would later acquire the
remaining shares in a merger for $29 a share.
   The two-step plan was designed to circumvent a Delaware
anti-takeover law that restricts hostile bidders from building a
stake in a company incorporated in that state.
   Under TW Services' ``poison pill'' defense plan, purchases in
excess of 20 percent would trigger a provision allowing stockholders
to buy shares at half price, making a takeover prohibitively
expensive. Coniston is seeking to have the plan overturned in
Delaware Chancery Court.
   TW Services owns 1,200 Denny's restaurants, 400 Hardee's
fast-food restaurants, Canteen Corp., a food services company, and
27 skilled nursing homes and two retirement living centers.

   Grand Metropolitan PLC said Thursday its profit
rose 52 percent in its latest fiscal year, boosted by gains in its
liquor, food and retailing businesses.
   Grand Met, which has launched a hostile $5.23 billion takeover
bid for U.S.-based Pillsbury Co., said net profit in the year ended
Sept. 30 rose to 701.7 million pounds, or $1.3 billion, after an
extraordinary gain of 289.7 million pounds, or $536 million from
business disposals.
   A year earlier, an extraordinary gain of 127.8 million pounds, or
$236 million, boosted net profit to 461 million pounds, or $853
million.
   Grand Met said its revenue rose 5.6 percent to 6.03 billion
pounds, or $11.2 billion from 5.71 billion pounds, or about $10.6
billion.
   Grand Met's liquor division continued to be the major earner,
with operating profit up 23 percent at 316 million pounds,or $585
million.
   Food businesses had operating profit of 84 million pounds, or
$155 million, up 21.7 percent, while retailing showed operating
profit of 179 million pounds, or $331 million, an 11.9-percent gain.
   Grand Met said its sale of the Inter-Continental hotel chain to
Seibu Saison Group of Japan, due to be completed Dec. 15, will
realize 1.2 billion pounds, or $2.2 billion.
   Grand Met didn't break out quarterly or half-year results. It is

   A special edition of The European was distributed
Thursday, giving Europe its first look at the English-language daily
by British publisher Robert Maxwell.
   The sample issue was distributed free in major cities. It will
hit newsstands on May 9, 1989, and cover news, finance, sports and
lifestyle from major European points.
   The paper resembles USA Today, also sold in Europe. There were
big color photos _ two on the front page alone along with bold
headlines, captions, cartoons and a color weather map on the back
page.
   Maxwell said it cost $1.4 million to prepare, print and
distribute 7 million sample copies in 20 European cities.
   Stories in the sample edition honored Jean Monnet, the founding
father of the European Community. Another recounted an outlandish
Amsterdam wedding in which the bride carried a bouquet of plastic
tulips adorned with lights.
   On a ``News from Home'' page, the paper also carried stories
written in French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, German, Portugese, Greek
and Danish.
   The European will cost about 85 cents and have a circulation of
550,000 reaching 2 million readers.

<HEAD>The Power of Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1982, the median-priced existing home required
a monthly payment of $702. In October 1988, the median-priced home
required only $588 a month to carry.
   This is a story about the impact of interest rates _ and it is
only beginning. The 1982 house cost $67,800, the 1988 house cost
$88,100. That is, the lower-priced house cost $114 more to carry
than the higher-priced one.
   The explanation for this otherwise strange situation lies in the
interest rates that prevailed in the two periods. In 1982, the
average interest rate was 15.38 percent. In October of this year it
was 9.41 percent.
   Interest rates power housing markets. Consider this additional
statistic: In 1982, when home prices were lower, monthly payments
took 35.9 percent of median family income. In October 1988, the
percentage was only 22.2.
   The significance of such figures, compiled by the National
Association of Realtors on the basis of 20 percent downpayments, is
becoming increasingly important now, the reason being that home
mortgage rates are rising.
   It's bad news for a lot of people.
   While the immediate emphasis is likely to be on the growing
difficulty of families to find affordable homes, the impact is more
widespread. Sellers may have to wait longer for a sale. Agents may
face reduced income and possibly lose jobs. Builders conceivably
could have to lay off workers.
   No wonder, therefore, that the key forecasting tool of the entire
housing industry is the level and direction of interest rates.
   John Tuccillo, NAR chief economist, believes the higher trend of
rates will last through the winter. They'll continue higher for
about five months, he says, ``and this will cause a further decline
in affordability conditions.''
   The potential homebuyer who won't be hurt, and might even be
aided by these conditions, is the all-cash buyer. While such people
are rare, they do exist; most of them probably are those who have
just sold another home.
   For such people, the possibility exists that interest rates will
drive down prices _ they already have to a slight degree _ or at
least place buyers in a stronger negotiating position.
   Worst hurt by rising rates are first-time buyers.
   Trade-up buyers _ those who have owned and now wish to move up to
a more expensive house _ at least have sufficient money for
downpayments and closing costs. First-timers might have to count
every nickel.
   For first-timers, the temptation might be to postpone buying in
the hope of lower interest rates next spring. It's a risk that could
prove correct. It could also boomerang, since lower interest rates
at any time of the year generally push up prices _ and in the spring
this impact is intensified.
   Based on October prices and rates, the NAR offers this rough
affordability guide for those planning to buy:
   _For buyers with income of $20,000, the mortgage amount that can
be handled is $50,000 on a home price of $62,500.
   _Income $30,000, mortgage $75,000, home price $93,800.
   _Income $40,000, mortgage $100,000, home price $125,000.
   _Income $50,000, mortgage $125,000, home price $156,300.
   _Income $60,000, mortgage $150,000, home price $187,500.
   _Income $70,000, mortgage $175,000, home price $218,000.
   Of course, all this could change radically.
   If interest rates rise, prices might fall, but in all probability
they might not fall enough to offset the higher carrying charges. If
rates fall, prices might rise, but most likely not enough to offset
the better rates.
   Watch interest rates. They're the key to the housing market.

   Miller Brewing Co. is going after younger
drinkers with a pair of television commercials for its Lite beer
that parody traditional consumer product ads, including rival Bud
Light's ads with Spuds MacKenzie.
   In one of the ads that debut Sunday night, a clay monkey,
elephant and lion dance with a Lite beer in hand while an announcer
says, ``Three out of four party animals preferred the taste of
Miller Lite.''
   Bud Light, which has enjoyed double-digit sales growth recently,
has heralded Spuds as the ``original party animal'' in its ads.
   Lite remains the clear leader in the Lite beer category, but
Miller executives hope the new ads will prove more appealing to
drinkers ages 21 to 25 who may not relate to the ex-sports stars in
Lite's long-running ``tastes great, less filling'' campaign.
   Miller says it has no intention of dropping the all-star campaign
that Lite has used for 15 years.
   The ads will run concurrently as ``companion campaigns,'' said
spokesman Bob Bertini.
   In addition to the party animals, the new 30-second ads use
animation and offer irreverent parodies of well-worn ad techniques.
   ``I'm not a beer drinker,'' the smooth-talking celebrity
spokesman says in one of the new ads, ``... but I play one on TV.''
   ``We are taking the position as a leader in the category that we
have to stand out and take risks,'' Bertini said in a telephone
interview from Milwaukee. ``We think viewers will respond to it.''
   He said the ads will be placed principally on late-night
television shows that tend to attract young adults.
   Lite sold 19.2 million barrels in 1987, placing second only to
Budweiser, the overall best-selling beer at an estimated 50.1
million barrels, according to the trade publication Impact.
   But Lite's sales were flat in 1987 for the first time in more
than a decade, while Bud Light sales jumped 21.2 percent to 8
million barrels, Impact said.
   Bertini said Lite sales are up this year, but that its sales to
the 21-25 age category have not increased.
   These young adults may not recognize the retired celebrities in
the regular Lite campaign but they should like the irreverence of
the new ads, he said.
   In the first commercial, a voice announces ``The new Miller Lite
commercial _ backed with research!''
   In rapid-fire order, a man with cash stashed under his sport
jacket attracts some interest from two pretty women as the announcer
says ``Studies show that you're 79 percent more likely to meet an
attractive woman while drinking a Lite long-neck ... and carrying $1
million cash.''
   The commercial then cuts to a frantic party scene as the
announcer asserts Lite ``is served at 87 percent of the parties your
parents would never attend.''
   In the ad with the party animals, the announcer notes that Miller
Lite is ``the light beer ... without the `g-h'.''
   Both spots end with the slogan, ``Only a beer that tastes this
great could do a commercial like this.''

<TEXT>
   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange closed
down but higher than their session lows on Thursday.
   Trading was marked by a general lack of buying interest and
concern about continuing over-capacity in the British securities
markets.
   Trading volume was concentrated in a few blue chip stocks, with
the British retailing sector attracting some of the heaviest
turnover.
   But dealers said the market shook off its brief euphoria over
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's troop reduction proposals on
Wednesday and focused once again on the uncertain prospects for the
British economy.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 13.8
points, or 0.8 percent, lower at 1,757.9, above the day's low of
19.7 points off. The session peak was 3.1 points down.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed 13.9 points lower at
1,437.1.
   Volume was a moderate 543.8 million shares, up from 490.1 million
shares a day earlier.
   Dealers said the market drifted lower for much of the day as
institutional investors again held back from buying stock at the
market's lower levels. Prices were also affected by concern that
more brokerage firms will cut back their British operations
following Morgan Grenfell Group PLC's decision earlier this week to
withdraw from market making in equities and government bonds.
   The Financial Times 500-share index fell 9.49 points to close at
987.80.

   Interco Inc. announced Thursday that as part of
its corporate restructuring plan, the Florsheim Shoe Co. division
will close plants in Paducah, Ky., and Hermann, Mo.
   The company said the Paducah plant will close Feb. 10, and the
Hermann plant will close Feb. 24.
   The moves will result in direct cost savings of more than $2
million annually, Interco said. A total of 650 jobs will be
affected, a spokesman said, as production from the plants is
reassigned to Florsheim's remaining four domestic plants.
   The restructuring was made necessary to head off a $2.7 billion
hostile takeover of Interco by Cardinal Acquisition Corp., headed by
brothers Steven M. and Mitchell P. Rales of Washington, D.C.
   No further plant closings in the Florsheim division are
anticipated, Interco said.
   ``The closings reflect our commitment to implement as soon a
practicable our recapitalization and restructuring plan,'' said
Interco.
   As previously announced, the plan calls for annual cost savings
totaling $75 million, the sale of the Apparel Manufacturing Group,
Ethan Allen Inc. and other assets.

<TEXT>
   Research and development spending by industry,
government, universities and non-profit organizations will increase
4.6 percent next year, but inflation will account for most of the
rise, a magazine predicted Thursday.
   Research & Development magazine projected in its January issue
that $130.8 billion will spent on research next year, compared to an
estimated $125 billion for 1988.
   ``We expect that research and develepment spending will be flat
in constant dollars in 1989,'' said Timothy Kelly, the magazine's
publisher.
   The magazine attributed the leveling off to slow corporate
growth, a business climate focusing on short-term profits, a wave of
mergers and acquisitions, and expectations of smaller government
outlays because of needs to reduce the deficit.
   The 1988 spending level is about $7 billion lower than expected
because of cuts in government and private financing, the magazine
said. The government accounts for about half of the nation's
research spending.

<TEXT>
   Terrence Brennan, editor of The Mercury in
Pottstown, Pa., for the past three years, has been named publisher
of The Telegraph.
   The announcement was made Wednesday by C. Thomas Marschel,
president of Suburban Newspapers of Greater St. Louis, parent
company of The Telegraph.
   Brennan, 41, replaces Bruce Spotleson.
   Brennan became editor of The Mercury in September 1985 and helped
guide the 30,000-circulation morning newspaper about 50 miles west
of Philadelphia. For the three years before that, he served as
assistant sports editor of the Delaware County Daily Times, a
60,000-circulation newspaper in suburban Philadelphia.
   Brennan also worked as a sports writer for the Philadelphia
Bulletin from 1975 until the paper closed in 1982. He is a 1968
graduate of Penn State University.
   ``This paper belongs to the people of Alton,'' said Brennan,
promising to keep The Telegraph's focus on the local community.
``They've grown up with it. It's a part of their heritage, a part of
their family, and it belongs to them.''

<HEAD>Last Obstacle to Citizens-Scotland Bank Merger Cleared</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $440 million acquisition of Citizens
Financial Group by the Royal Bank of Scotland cleared its final
obstacle Thursday when a Massachusetts regulatory agency approved
the merger.
   The deal needed clearance by the Massachusetts Board of Bank
Incorporation because Providence-based Citizens recently acquired a
Massachusetts bank, Fairhaven Savings Bank.
   The merger with the Royal Bank of Scotland already had been
approved by shareholders and the Federal Reserve Board.
   Citizens, which has $2.9 billion in assets, will become the
American flagship of the Scottish bank. The combined companies will
operate in several countries with assets of $38.7 billion.
   Citizens President George Graboys has said the merger will help
Citizens compete in the crowded New England banking business. Two
other major Rhode Island banks, Fleet National Bank and Hospital
Trust National Bank, also have merged with out-of-state banks in
recent years.
   Citizens said the merger would be completed later this month.

<HEAD>Export Hopes Boost Wheat Futures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices closed substantially higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade on talk that China was set to
bid for 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices,
analysts said.
   Soybean and oat futures also closed higher while corn was
narrowly mixed.
   The Agriculture Department announced late Wednesday that it had
targeted the Chinese for 1 million metric tons of wheat under the
Export Enhancement Program, and ``the trade talk is that they are
bidding for wheat right now,'' said Ted Mao, a grain specialist with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Grain and soybean futures had opened sharply higher on fears that
Wednesday's devastating earthquake in Soviet Armenia had damaged two
nuclear power plants in the area, but those gains were quickly pared.
   ``The markets managed to weed out what appears to be the truth,
which is that the reactors are operating without any difficulty,''
Mao said.
   At the close, wheat was 5 cents to 6\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.29\ a bushel; corn was 1{
cents lower to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.56{ a bushel;
oats were 1{ cents to 4 cents higher with December at $2.03 a
bushel; soybeans were 2} cents to 6\ cents higher with January at
$7.73 a bushel.

   Stock prices turned downward today as the
``Gorbachev rally'' of the past few sessions showed signs of fading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 61.35
points in the week's first three trading days, dropped 5.51 to
2,148.12 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 9 to 5 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 492 up, 923

   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev cut short his visit to the United
States to return home because of a devastating earthquake in Soviet
Armenia.
   Analysts said traders remained encouraged by his pledge Wednesday
to make significant cutbacks in military forces.
   But some financial observers raised questions about how much help
that development would bring any time in the near future toward
reducing the U.S. budget deficit through lessened defense spending.
   In addition, brokers said, attention on Wall Street shifted back
to the near-term outlook for interest rates and the possibility of a
further increase in the Federal Reserve's discount rate.
   American Telephone & Telegraph rose [ to 29~; GTE gained ] to

<TEXT>
   The 1988 Christmas shopping season is off to a
modestly good start, although retailers in some parts of the country
report warmer weather has put a damper on their holiday spirits.
   ``We're doing fine _ right on target,'' Miraed Smith, a
spokeswoman at Bloomingdale's flagship store in Manhattan, said
Thursday.
   Frank DeLuca, vice president of I.J. Fox, a Boston furrier, said
his company has had steady, if not spectacular, sales increases
since Thanksgiving.
   ``It looks solid and that's fine by me,'' he said. ``Everybody
likes growth, but a nice steady growth to me is better than wild
swings and roller-coaster rides.''
   At Marshall Field's, the Chicago-based department store, ``At
lunchtime, especially in the downtown store, you see so many people
with big boxes and bags that it's difficult to weave your way
through the aisles,'' said spokeswoman Hillary Rosenfeld.
   Field's expected to meet or exceed its target of a seasonal sales
increase in the ``high single digits,'' Ms. Rosenfeld said, adding,
``Each day's sales definitely play right into that plan, at least
reaching that goal.''
   Securities analysts who track the industry said the first two
weeks of the season have been good, and they are optimistic
retailers will have moderately strong increases from the dismal
performance of Christmas 1987.
   ``So far, it looks positive, but the proof of the pudding is the
last 10 days'' when most shoppers are expected to make their
purchases, said Monroe Greenstein, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &
Co.
   ``For most retailers, Christmas sales are slightly above plan,''
said Walter Loeb, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.
   Loeb said the occurrence of Hanukkah at the beginning of December
this year ``shifted some shopping to the early part of the month,''
but that sales of Christmas gifts also were proceeding well.
   ``The rest of the year will be quite good,'' Loeb predicted.
   Retailers across the country have gone into this Christmas season
with caution and lowered expectations because of a retail sales
slump that is nearly two years old. Holiday sales last year were
disappointing, and many retailers slashed prices to bring customers
into the stores.
   This Christmas, there are ``sale'' signs up in many stores, but
they are not as widespread as they were a year ago, Greenstein said.
   The analysts said sales will get a boost this season since
calendar shifts have created two more shopping days than there were
in 1987.
   The fact that Christmas falls on Sunday this year is another help.
   ``It gives you that major Saturday on Christmas Eve, which is
going to be gangbusters,'' said Tom McCracken, vice president for
sales at Crowley Milner & Co., which operates 10 department stores
in Michigan.
   Sales have slowed in areas such as the Northeast because of
unseasonably warm weather, said Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch & Co.
   Consumers don't feel in the mood to shop for Christmas when it's
warm, and in Texas, where temperatures also have been high,
retailers are disappointed by lower-than-expected sales.
   ``The Thanksgiving weekend was not very good for us,'' said Scott
Glass, president and chief operating officer for Scarbroughs
department stores in Austin. ``We expected the big Christmas rush,
but we did not get it.''
   Dallas-based Neiman Marcus stores also have seen some slow days,
spokeswoman Pat Zajac said.
   ``We went gangbusters on Thanksgiving weekend and we had a good
first week, but we saw a slight slowing trend last weekend,'' Ms.
Zajac said. ``It now seems to be picking up again, so we think it
looks good for us.''
   However, the Texas retailers said an early trend toward more
expensive items seems to be holding firm. Fine jewelry, home
decorator items and other upscale gifts are doing well.
   At Bloomingdale's, $129 cashmere sweaters are big sellers, and so
are $300 separates by designer Donna Karan, Ms. Smith said. But $25
watches and $40 bathrobes are also popular, she said.
   At the nation's largest discount retailer, K mart Corp.,
``seasonal items such as decorations and apparel are selling well,
but there is no one hot item,'' said vice president for marketing
Michael Wellman.
   K mart's sales across the country slightly exceeded expectations
in the first week after Thanksgiving but were off the mark somewhat
this week, Wellman said.
   ``If you put the two together we're about on track with our
expected 6 percent increase,'' he said.
   ``This is not a Christmas that will go down in the history books,
but we didn't expect it to be,'' Wellman said.
   At Crowley Milner in Michigan, ``Things at this time have been
soft for us. We've had some good days and we've had some soft
days,'' said McCracken, the vice president for sales. ``But we feel
good _ we think it's going to be there,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gorbachev a No-Show As Soviets Open Trade Fair</HEAD>

   Their top salesman was missing, but Soviet
entrepreneurs went ahead Thursday with the opening of an
unprecedented trade show intended to usher in a new era of
Soviet-American commerce.
   As fashion models showed off the latest trends from Moscow to the
beat of American pop music, Soviet executives showed off their
wares, including furs, tractors, vodka, books, toys, cars, guns and
caviar.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev had been scheduled to open the
trade fair, which is a showcase for his policy of perestroika, or
economic restructuring. But his appearance was scrubbed when he
decided to return to Moscow early because of a catastrophic
earthquake in Armenia.
   In his place, deputy premier Vladimir M. Kamentsev cut the ribbon
along with U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William Verity.
   Kamentsev hastily delivered a speech calling for the lowering of
trade barriers between the United States and the Soviet Union, then
rushed from the hall to catch a plane to Moscow.
   Verity, congratulating the Soviets for Gorbachev's
``electrifying'' United Nations speech on Wednesday, also hailed the
improvement in trade between the two nations.
   ``We believe this is an important step in building long-term,
mutually beneficial, non-strategic trade between the United States
and the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   The Soviets spent an estimated $2 million on the trade show at
the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center _ one measure of the
importance the Soviet Union places on increased trade with the
United States.
   ``You really only do this to someone you want to impress,'' said
David Wolstenholme, whose American marketing company spent more than
a year putting together the show, which runs through Dec. 20 and is
open to the public.
   The Soviets want to increase exports to the United States to
raise their reserves of hard currency, which they need to purchase
goods from the United States and other Western nations.
   But as Kamentsev suggested and the trade show reveals, U.S. trade
barriers make it extremely difficult for Soviet enterprises to sell
their goods in this country.
   For instance, Vil Rayevskiy, the salesman at a booth offering
Baikal hunting rifles, said the Soviets have had some success
selling the guns to European countries but not to the United States.
   ``The main problem and the main obstacle is your very high duty
for our consumer goods,'' he said.
   According to Rayevskiy, the United States imposes a 60 percent
duty on the guns, whereas gun manufacturers from some countries _
those with most-favored-nation status _ pay only 10 percent.
   ``How can we compete with them?'' he asked. ``Reduce our price to
zero?''
   Asked why he bothered to come to the show, Rayevskiy said, ``We
hope these goods will be interesting to American people and maybe
there will be some changes in this law.''
   Other Soviet enterprises have had more success. Smoky Harrison,
an American spokesman for Soviet-made Belarus tractors, said the
company has been doubling its sales annually since 1985 and expects
to sell more than 2,000 tractors in the United States this year.
   ``It's a basic tractor, a basic tool,'' Harrison said.
   Perestroika also has been profitable for U.S. companies that
operate in the Soviet Union. Perhaps the most successful has been
Pepsi-Cola, which signed a multimillion-dollar agreement Thursday to
expand its trade with the Soviet Union.
   Other Americans, such as Jim Hickman and Peter Buckle of Los
Angeles, have entered joint ventures with Soviet enterprises without
expecting large profits immediately.
   Hickman and Buckle are working with the Symbol Cooperative in
Moscow to market souvenir T-shirts and sweatshirts. Some examples at
the trade fair included a sweatshirt bearing the logo of Moscow
State University and one that says ``Summit '89'' in Russian and
``Gorbachev-Bush'' in English.
   The two said the Russian sweatshirts were not up to the quality
demanded by the U.S. market, and high tariffs made them too
expensive to sell profitably in this country.
   Still, Hickman said, ``the long-term Soviet market'' justifies
their investment.
   ``We're in on the cutting edge of perestroika, which gives one a
lot of opportunities as well as being an exciting time,'' added
Buckle.

   Assets of the nation's 459 money market mutual
funds fell $1.22 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline to $279.54 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday followed a $1.13 billion decline the previous week, the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group said.
   The funds' assets hit a revised record high of $281.89 billion in
the week ended Nov. 23, 1988.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 231 general purpose funds fell $47.8 million to $89.89
billion, assets of 92 broker-dealer funds rose $145.2 million to
$117.78 billion, and assets of 136 institutional funds fell $1.32
billion to $71.87 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.85 percent from 7.75 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.72 percent from 7.65 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 35
days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts rose to 6.15 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.12 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was unchanged at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.08
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.02 the
previous week. Yields were 8.35 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.27
percent; 8.49 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.42 percent; and 8.66
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.62 percent.

   The American Association of Retired Persons
presented a special recognition award Thursday to The Associated
Press, honoring the news cooperative's 1987 series of stories on the
nation's guardianship system.
   Horace B. Deets, executive director of AARP, said the citation
recognizes ``those in the private sector who have made outstanding
contributions to enhance the quality of life for older people.''
   William Ahearn, managing editor of the AP, accepted the award on
behalf of the reporters and editors who produced the six-part
national series on the guardianship system and more than 300 other
stories that examined guardianship in all 50 states and the District
of Columbia.
   The AP's year-long study found that in many states, the elderly
are often placed under guardianship with few of the due process
rights guaranteed even criminals. The investigation also found
courts that placed people under guardianship often failed to monitor
abuse of the elderly and misappropriation of their money.
   Since publication of the articles, at least 20 states have passed
or introduced legislation to reform their guardisanship systems.
Three bills are now before Congress proposing federal standards for
guardiahsip.
   AARP also honored the Puget Sound Power and Light Co., The
Travelers Companies and Oregon Health Decisions Inc.
   AARP cited the Puget Sound company for its efforts to train
staffers to meet the needs of older people. The Travelers was cited
for its ``Older Americans Program,'' which includes a job bank in
which 700 retirees from Travelers and other companies are registered
for part-time or temporary work at the company. Oregon Health was
cited for providing a forum wherein citizens, health policy makers
and health providers can seek solutions to health-care policy
questions.
   Deets said these organizations ``are an inspiration to others in
the private sector to participate in similar community activties.''

<HEAD>Bankers To Get More Than $700 Million For RJR Nabisco Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bankers will reap more that $700 million in fees
for their participation in history's largest deal, according to
government documents filed in the wake of the $24.53 billion buyout
of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Company directors, meanwhile, said Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co.'s vow to retain some of the company's food operations and
preserve the benefits of terminated employees tilted the scales
against the management group led by Chief Executive F. Ross Johnson
in the buyout battle.
   Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
suggest investment and commercial bankers would get as much as
$711.88 million in fees for arranging financing for Kohlberg's $109
cash-and-securities offer for each share of RJR stock.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. would take home the lion's share of
the fees, getting an estimated $226.88 million. Merrill Lynch & Co.
would receive $109.38 million, while Morgan Stanley & Co. and
Wasserstein, Perella & Co. would get $25 million each.
   In addition, a syndicate of four banks _ Bankers Trust Co. Chase
Manhattan Bank, Citibank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. _ would
split $325 million for lining up $14.5 billion in bank loans.
   Drexel could also end up with 4 percent of RJR Nabisco, while
Merrill Lynch would get 2 percent.
   Although the dollar amounts are huge, the percentages are low for
leveraged buyouts.
   ``Of course, we don't have much to compare it with,'' William
Curt Hunter, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta who
has studied fees paid investment bankers, said Thursday.
   The previous record fee for a leveraged buyout was the $49
million paid in the 1986 $6.1 billion sale of Beatrice Cos., also
bought by Kohlberg.
   According to the filing, the fees break down this way:
   _A 1.5 percent commitment fee and .05 percent funding fee to
Drexel Burnham for a $3.5 billion bridge loan; Merrill Lynch
receives the same fees for a $1.5 billion bridge loan.
   _Drexel Burnham and Merrill Lynch each will receive another 3.62{
percent when they replace the $1.5 billion bridge loans with junk
bonds.
   _Drexel Burnham gets another 3.87{ percent for the remaining $1.5
billion in junk bonds.
   _The four investment bankers get $25 million each for other
services, including advice and financing.
   ``Although these dollars seem excessive, they're probably not if
you look at the risk,'' Hunter said.
   ``There's a lot of risk involved, and also underwriting the junk
bonds,'' he said. ``There's a real question if the market can absorb
this amount of financing.''
   Also in the filing, Kohlberg disclosed 10-year business
projections made by RJR management and provided during the
negotiations.
   Profits for the nation's 19th largest industrial company are
expected to jump from $1.4 billion in 1988 to $4.6 billion by 1998,
with tobacco continuing to provide most of the profit, the filing
said.
   By 1998, sales of the company's tobacco products, including
Winston, Salem and Camel cigarettes, are projected to go from $6.1
billion a year to $15.7 billion a year, with operating income from
tobacco climbing from $1.9 billion to $5.5 billion.
   Food sales _ Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, Planters peanuts, Del
Monte vegetables and others _ could go from $9.9 billion to $18.5
billion, with operational income rising from $1.1 billion to $2.4
billion.
   Kohlberg has said it may sell as much as $6 billion worth of the
food business, especially in areas that may raise antitrust
questions because of KKR's Beatrice holdings.
   However RJR's board said in a separate SEC filing that it
accepted Kohlberg's offer in part because it ``contemplated
retention of substantial portions of the company's food business,
while the revised management group's proposal contemplated the sale
of all the company's food businesses.''
   Another plus for Kohlberg was its willingness ``to provide for
the preservation of benefits for employees whose employment would be
terminated as a result of the business divestitures while
representatives of the management group were unwilling to provide
for the preservations of such benefits.''
   The board opened the bidding to all-comers after Johnson's
original $75-a-share offer on Oct. 20, and extended the auction to
seek higher offers, including taking post-deadline offers from both
sides.
   The filing said a final decision was made Nov. 30 to declare
Kohlberg the winner because ``the risk that further negotiation with
either the management group or KKR could result in the withdrawal of
either party from the bidding process, which could have adversely
affected the (board's) special committee's ability to achieve the
highest and best offer for the company.''
   While the SEC filings reveal some of the details of the offer,
there is no indication yet about the future of some of the
executives who were involved Johnson's bid.
   Kohlberg partner Henry Kravis, visiting R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., in Winston-Salem, N.C. earlier this week, repeated his plans
for Johnson to leave the company after the deal is completed, to be
replaced in the interim by former RJR chief J. Paul Sticht. However
he said tobacco chief Edward Horrigan may be kept on.
   Horrigan was the No. 2 man in the seven-person management group
and his departure had been expected. However Kravis said, ``The door
is open for discussion with Mr. Horrigan.''

   Alaska is poised to become a major player
in developing a national energy policy during the administration of
President-elect George Bush, Gov. Steve Cowper said Thursday.
   ``We ought to be in a position where we're driving American oil
and gas policy,'' Cowper said at a news conference. ``We produce
more than anybody else in the country.''
   Cowper returned late Wednesday from a three-day meeting of the
Interstate Oil Compact Commission in suburban Kansas City, Kan.
Cowper, the commission chairman, predicted the 52-year-old
organization will become more influential in directing national
energy policy.
   The Democratic governor said he met privately Wednesday with
Texas oilman Robert Mosbacher, a longtime Bush associate selected by
the Republican president-elect to be commerce secretary in his
administration.
   Cowper said they discussed opening Alaska's Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas development, the export of Alaska
natural gas and the state's seafood industry.
   ``He was favorably inclined toward our positions on all the
matters I discussed with him, and I think that this administration
will reflect those same views,'' Cowper said. ``I felt very good
about Mr. Mosbacher and I think we'll have a very close relationship
with the Department of Commerce.''
   Cowper declined to discuss details of his talk with Mosbacher
``because he's facing his confirmation hearings and things have a
way of slipping out and being misinterpreted.''
   He noted that Alaska's natural resources commissioner, Judith M.
Brady, was elected a vice chairwoman of the commission, and he will
take over as chairman of the National Governors Association energy
subcommittee in February.
   ``Having those two positions here in Alaska at the same time is
going to put us in a very unusual position to affect national oil
and gas policy, and that's going to be good for all of us,'' Cowper
said.
   The commmission has not yet agreed on which direction the
nation's oil and gas policy should take, Cowper said. The group
represents 29 states, including oil producers and consumers, and
will further discuss policy issues at its June meeting.
   ``Our main goal, believe it or not, is going to be to convince
the country why America needs an active and viable oil and gas
industry,'' the governor said. ``At the moment the oil industry is
on a serious decline, particularly the independents.''
   Cowper said he would like to see a limit on oil imports, combined
with tax credits and incentives to stimulate domestic production.
That may lead to an entitlement program to determine who gets cheap
foreign crude and who gets the more expensive domestic crude, he
said.
   Cowper said he does not expect Congress to adopt an oil-import
fee.

   Eastman Kodak Co. has developed a blood
analyzer that works in zero gravity conditions for use aboard the
U.S. space station currently scheduled to go into orbit in 1995.
   Company officials said the analyzer, which doesn't use liquid
chemicals, will allow medical personnel on the ground to evaluate
illness and other conditions of the crew.
   ``Kodak dry chemistry technology is ideally suited to the space
environment in terms of compactness, convenience and storage,'' said
John Zeman, vice president and general manager, Clinical Products
Division.
   The prototype analyzer is being tested by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, and is one of two diagnostic
systems Kodak is designing for the space station.
   NASA officials have also asked Kodak to develop an innovative
X-ray system that will permit images to be taken in space and
transmitted to the ground for evaluation.

   Stock prices headed lower Thursday, breaking a
three-session winning streak as Wall Street's ``Gorbachev rally''
showed signs of fading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 61.35
points in the week's first three trading days, dropped back 11.92 to
2,141.71.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
510 up, 936 down and 545 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board slowed to 124.15 million
shares from 148.36 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 149.99 million shares.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev cut short his visit to the United
States to return home because of the devastating earthquake in
Soviet Armenia.
   Analysts said traders remained encouraged by his pledge Wednesday
to make significant cutbacks in military forces.
   But some financial observers raised questions about how much help
that development would bring any time in the near future toward
reducing the U.S. budget deficit through lessened defense spending.
   In addition, brokers said, attention on Wall Street shifted back
to the near-term outlook for interest rates and the possibility of a
further increase in the Federal Reserve's discount rate.
   United Telecommunications rose 1| to 45] and GTE gained [ to 45{,
while American Telephone & Telegraph finished unchanged at 29} after
trading as high as 30[.
   The federal government awarded large contracts for a new
telephone system to AT&T and U.S. Sprint, which is owned by GTE and
Unitel.
   Losers in the blue chip sector included International Business
Machines, down 1| at 119]; Exxon, down [ at 44\; Eastman Kodak, down
{ at 45}, and General Motors, down ] at 86.
   Technology issues were also weak. Digital Equipment dropped 1 to
94|; Hewlett-Packard 1~ to 49|; Honeywell 1| to 58[, and Data
General { to 17}.
   Wyse Technology fell \ to 6|, trading at a new 52-week low. On
Wednesday the company said it expects to post a loss for the fiscal
third quarter that ends Dec. 31, and that its results for the nine
months through Dec. 31 might also be in the red.
   Sovran Financial rose 1{ to 34{. The stock was added to Standard
& Poor's 500-stock composite index, prompting buying by index funds
set up to match the performance of the S&P 500.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $13.46 billion, or 0.49
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .77 to 155.37.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index lost 2.08 to 318.46, and S&P's

<HEAD>Two Members Barred from Insurance Market for Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two prominent members of Lloyd's of London have
been banned from the insurance market for life for allegedly bilking
the company of interest in a scheme to enrich themselves and their
families, Lloyd's said Thursday.
   In addition to the permanent suspension of John Raymond Parry and
Frederick Charles Raven, one of their colleagues, Arthur Henry
Bertram Grattan-Bellew, has been suspended from Lloyd's for five
years and another, Edward Ernest Nelson, for two years.
   Each of the four has been fined 150,000 pounds, or about
$278,000, Lloyd's said.
   The penalties were reached at a special meeting of the Council of
Lloyd's, the market's ruling body, on Wednesday after an internal
disciplinary and appeals procedure.
   All four were found guilty of ``discreditable conduct'' in
siphoning off excessive slices of interest earned on premiums
invested in certain insurance activities for themselves or their
families, Lloyd's said.
   The amount siphoned off was not specified. A Lloyd's spokesman
was unavailable Thursday evening for comment.
   Parry and Raven issued a statement denying wrongdoing and
expressing dismay at what they called the severity of the punishment.
   Documents relating to the accusations have been passed to the
Serious Fraud Office, Lloyd's said.
   Sir Edward Singleton, a former president of the Law Society, was
appointed to carry out an investigation into the Bellew, Parry and
Raven group in 1984.
   He took two years to analyze the activities of the group, set up
by underwriters Parry, Raven and Grattan-Bellew.
   The group did insurance brokering, acting as agents for Lloyd's
investors, as well as reinsurance.
   The investigation led to 132 charges by the Lloyd's authorities
against the three men, as well as Nelson, who had interests in
certain companies within the group, Lloyd's said; and Albert John
Stratton, who was cleared of all allegations.
   The defendants denied all the counts, but Parry and Raven offered
to admit certain matters if the charges were amended. The Council of
Lloyd's rejected their offer.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Lower, Gold Prices Are Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar retreated in foreign exchange trading
Thursday, as the markets calmed down from Wednesday's frenetic
trading.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National of New York quoted a
late bid of $421.30 for a troy ounce of gold, down from $422.50 late
Wednesday.
   The dollar had surged in hectic trading Wednesday after Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev said his country would unilaterally cut its
miltary forces. The market's initial reaction was based on the
belief that the United States would also cut its forces and in so
doing help narrow the U.S. budget deficit.
   But later Wednesday, once the initial euphoria wore off and
dealers decided any reduction in U.S. troops would have a marginal
impact on the deficit at best, the dollar gave up some of its gains.
   It continued to slide in Thursday's trading.
   ``When you look at the hard cold economics, it doesn't really
mean the dollar should be valued upward,'' Richard Witten, vice
president for foreign exchange at Goldman Sachs & Co., said of
Gorbachev's announcement and the market's reaction to it.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.59 to a closing 123.02 yen. But later in London it
was quoted lower at 122.65 yen and in New York, it fell to 122.30
yen from late Wednesday's 123.525.
   The dollar also fell against the British pound. In London, it
cost $1.8510 to buy one pound, higher than $1.8425 Wednesday, and in
New York, one pound was worth $1.85505, compared with $1.8435 late
Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.73865 West German marks, down from
1.75975; 1.4633 Swiss francs, down from 1.4795; 5.9350 French
francs, down from 6.0035; 1,283.00 Italian lire, down from 1,299.00;
and 1.19275 Canadian dollars, down from 1.9925.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.7420 West German marks, down from 1.7588; 1.4665
Swiss francs, down from 1.4790; 5.9450 French francs, down from
6.0025; 1.9645 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9675; 1,285.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,290.75; 1.1933 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1995.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold fell to $421.80 a
troy ounce, down from $422.80 on Wednesday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $423.50 a troy ounce,
compared with $422.95 bid late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, gold fell to $423 from a $423.50 bid late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.78 to close at a bid $424.88.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.16 a troy ounce, compared with
Wednesday's $6.14. But on the Commodity Exchange, silver slipped to
$6.128 a troy ounce from late Wednesday's $6.140.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Soar To New Record High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper for spot delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange soared
to a record-high $1.6475 a pound Thursday, reflecting renewed
concerns about dwindling supplies, lagging production and surging
demand for the metal.
   On other markets, energy futures slipped, pulling precious-metals
futures lower; livestock and meat prices dipped; grains and soybeans
moved higher; and stock-index futures retreated.
   Copper's gains extended the rally launched Wednesday by reports
of an explosion at one of the world's largest copper mines in
Bouganville, Papua New Guinea.
   The blast was ruled sabotage and the mine's owner has shut down
operations there until the government provides security, said Bette
Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York.
   The Bouganville explosion refocused the market's attention on the
extremely tight availability of physical copper, a key factor in the
dramatic rise in copper's price from around $1 a pound in August.
   Copper inventories registered with the Comex and the London Metal
Exchange have declined by 50 percent in the last four months, and
global stocks have fallen to the equivalent of 2.9 weeks worth of
consumption, an all-time low.
   But world demand for copper, which is used heavily in the
construction and manufacturing industries, keeps rising, analysts
said. Mining and refining companies are trying to produce more but
those attempts frequently lead to problems, Ms. Raptopoulos said.
   ``Everyone's pushing to produce at maximum capacity, pressing too
hard, overloading capacity and they have periodic breakdowns,'' she
said.
   And in Peru, the world's sixth-largest copper producer last year,
a miners' strike is nearing the end of its second month.
   A dearth of deliveries against the December Comex contract
indicates no easing in the supply tightness, said Bernard Savaiko,
metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   ``Either no one has it to deliver or, if they do, they're
withholding it and waiting for higher prices,'' he said.
   Copper settled unchanged to 6.2 cents higher with most active
contract, for delivery in March, at $1.40 a pound, a new high for
that contract. The spot December contract finished at $1.6325, down
slightly from the day's record high.
   Energy futures prices fell sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   In the crude-oil market, a technical sell-off occurred after
traders tried and failed twice to bid the January contract up to $16
a barrel, said Peter Beutel, energy market analyst with Elders
Futures Inc. in New York.
   Meanwhile, prices of gasoline and heating-oil futures tumbled in
a continuing reaction to Tuesday's American Petroleum Institute
report, which showed steep increases in U.S. stocks of both fuels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 26 cents to 30 cents
lower with January at $15.44 a barrel; heating oil was .81 cent to
1.11 cents lower with January at 48.08 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .80 cent lower to .17 cent higher with January at 43.93
cents a gallon.
   The inflation-sensitive precious metals reacted negatively to the
decline in oil prices.
   On the Commodity Exchange, gold settled $1 to $1.20 lower with
February at $426.70 a troy ounce; silver was 1.2 cents to 2 cents
lower with March at $6.263 a troy ounce.
   Frozen pork-belly ftures fell sharply for the third straight day
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting concerns about slack
demand for pork products and high hog-slaughter numbers this week,
said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., of
Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Weak demand for beef contributed to a slide in cattle futures,
Morgan said.
   Live cattle settled .52 cent to .87 cent lower with December at
70.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent lower
with January at 81.92 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent to .63
cent lower with December at 40.47 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .20 cent to .92 cent lower with February at 42.02 cents a pound.
   Wheat futures posted substantial gains on the Chicago Board of
Trade on talk that China was set to bid for 400,000 metric tons of
U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, analysts said.
   Other grain and soybean futures had opened sharply higher on
fears that Wednesday's devastating earthquake in Soviet Armenia had
damaged two nuclear power plants, but those gains were quickly pared.
   Wheat settled 5 cents to 6{ cents higher with December at $4.29{
a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with December
at $2.56} a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 4} cents higher with
December at $2.03} a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 5{ cents
higher with January at $7.73{ a bushel.
   Stock-index futures settled slightly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled .75 point lower at 280.70. Each
point is worth $500.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three measures of the nation's money supply
rose in late November, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
$3.1 billion to a seasonally adjusted $787.8 billion in the week
ended Nov. 28 from $784.7 billion the previous week.
   The central bank said a broader measures known as M2 rose $3.7
billion to a seasonally adjusted $3,061.9 billion from $3,058.2
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased $1.9 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,896.7 billion from $3,894.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates as well as
the broader money measures M2 and M3.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $558 million in the
latest week, down from $1.104 billion in the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $285.7 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from
$285.0 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>New Lexus Nameplate to Woo Luxury Car Buyers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota unveiled a new luxury auto
nameplate Thursday, rolling out two new models designed to lure
yuppies graduating from economy imports and compete with top-drawer
European sports sedans.
   The cars introduce the Lexus line, which will be a division of
Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc., the American arm of Japan's Toyota
Motor Corp.
   In the manner of Honda's Acura, Toyota will try to establish a
separate, upscale identity for Lexus in part through design, price
and advertising, and in part by selling them through a separate
dealer network.
   The cars, to go on sale in September 1989, are:
   _The Lexus LS 400, a 4-door luxury sports sedan with Toyota's
first 4.0-liter V-8 engine and such high-tech features as anti-lock
brakes and a traction-control system, said to help drivers maintain
control in a wide variety of road conditions. The car, which
resembles the new Mercedes-Benz cars with which it is intended to
compete, will cost between $30,000 and $35,000, the company said.
   _The Lexus ES 250, a four-door ``executive sedan'' with a
2.5-liter V-6 engine and five-speed manual or four-speed automatic
transmission that shares many components with Toyota's Vista, a car
sold only in Japan. Closer in price and style to the successful
Acura, the car will sell for $20,000 to $25,000.
   The cars, introduced to the press at the Art Center College of
Design against a backdrop of modern sculptures and the rugged San
Gabriel Mountains, will be shown to the public in January at auto
shows in Detroit and Los Angeles.
   The Lexus line, in the works since 1983, mirrors Honda's strategy
of capturing the high end of the market with Acura and precedes
Nissan's similar Infinity nameplate onto the market.
   The Lexus strategy is two-fold, said J.C. ``Jim'' Perkins, the
American marketing man who is senior vice president at Lexus.
   On one end of the market, the company wants to retain baby
boomers who have long driven Toyotas and other Japanese imports but
who now earn enough to defect to luxury carmakers: ``The college
kids of the '70s who bought Corollas and trucks are moving into the
luxury market,'' Perkins noted. ``We want to be there to meet their
needs.''
   At the top end of the market, the LS 400 will compete with
Mercedes, BMW and the other European companies.
   The company hopes to sell 16,000 Lexus 1989 models from September
through the end of the year, a total of 75,000 in the first year on
the market, and up to 150,000 a year within a few years, Perkins
said. They will be sold initially by about 250 dealers. About 60 of
the first 100 dealers signed up so far also handle Toyotas.
   The car's designer, Kunihiro Uchida, said the cars are Toyota's
first to be made especially for the U.S. market. Uchida, who like
many top U.S. car designers studied at the Arts Center, said his
team did much of their work on the car in Southern California so
they could immerse themselves in the American car culture.

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family holding a majority interest
in Kansas City Life Insurance Co. has pushed its holdings beyond the
50 percent mark to help thwart a hostile takeover bid by a
Birmingham, Ala., company.
   Kansas City Life said Thursday that W.E. Bixby and J.R. Bixby
each acquired 50,000 shares of the company Wednesday, the same day a
federal judge refused a request by Torchmark Corp. to block
additional purchases by the brothers or Kansas City Life.
   Torchmark had asked U.S. District Judge Scott O. Wright to
prevent the Bixbys from buying more stock and gaining a majority of
Kansas City Life shares. Wright also rejected Torchmark's request
that he force Kansas City Life to negotiate with Torchmark, set up a
special directors committee to review the offer and hire new
financial advisers.
   The Bixby family, which already owned 48.8 percent of Kansas City
Life, increased its holdings to 50.3 percent of the company with the
purchases. The family members earlier signed a legally binding
agreement not to sell unless two-thirds of the family's stock voted
to dissolve the agreement. The agreement will expire May 21.
   Torchmark made its bid directly to stockholders and hoped it
could overcome a recommendation from Kansas City Life's directors
that stockholders reject the offer. The offer expires Wednesday.
   Kansas City Life directors earlier rejected offers of $43.50 a
share and $42.50 a share from Torchmark. At a meeting Wednesday, the
directors rejected Torchmark's latest offer of $47.50 a share. The
directors have said none of the offers is adequate considering the
company's value.

<HEAD>Founding Family Pushed Aside</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four years after going private in a $250
million leveraged buyout, Papercraft Corp., the nation's largest
maker of artificial Christmas trees, is pushing aside its founding
family.
   Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission say
founder Joseph M. Katz, 75, who retired as chairman in 1983, and his
son, Marshall P. Katz, 48, the current chairman, will be paid $1.5
million to terminate their employment contracts two years early.
   The two will resign from the board of directors after selling
135,000 of their 300,000 shares of Papercraft stock to Robert B.
Goergen, a turnaround specialist who succeeded Marshall Katz as
chief executive in August, The Pittsburgh Press reported Thursday.
   Their remaining shares will leave them with a 14.3 percent stake
in the company.
   Goergen Thursday confirmed the report and said he will succeed
Marshall Katz as chairman after the stock sale.
   The newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying the shakeup
reflects dissatisfaction with the company's finances.
   ``Earnings have not met the projections made at the time of the
LBO,'' Goergen said.
   The company has been hurt by a shift in consumer preference from
hard needles to soft needles on artificial Christmas trees. The
leveraged buyout was founded on the incorrect assumption that sales
and operating earnings would grow substantially.
   The 43-year-old Pittsburgh company told the SEC earlier this year
that it was not generating enough cash to pay interest on $98
million in bonds issued to its shareholders as part of the buyout.
The first interest payment is due in 1991.
   Goergen said the company will be able to meet a $9.2 million
interest payment due next year to senior debt to private investors.
   ``We have positive cash flow this year and projected positive
cash flow for next year,'' he said.
   Wall Street analysts say Papercraft is one of 10 troubled LBOs,
or companies purchased by management and outside investors using
mostly borrowed money, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday.
   Papercraft lost $14.1 million on sales of $179.8 million in 1987.
It lost $15 million on sales of $114.8 million in the first nine
months of this year, compared to a loss of $11.7 million on the same
revenue a year earlier.
   The company's most recent financial disclosures list long-term
debt of $215 million.
   Papercraft also makes gift wrapping, LePage's tapes and
adhesives, Royal Terry bath and kitchen towels and Modern Ortho
foot-care products.
   Despite being privately owned, Papercraft is covered by SEC
filing rules because its bonds are publicly held.

<HEAD>LTV Receives Exclusive Commercial Rights To Rocket</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV, the Dallas-based aerospace concern that
has produced Scout rockets for the government for the last 28 years,
has been granted the exclusive right to produce and launch the
rocket commercially, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration announced Thursday.
   The Scout is used mainly for small science payloads.
   The agreement with the Missiles Division of LTV Missiles and
Electronics group is ``another important advance in establishing a
strong U.S. commercial launch vehicle industry,'' the NASA
announcement said.
   Since the first launch on July 1, 1960, there have been 112 Scout
launches. LTV said the value of contracts to date has been more than
$350 million. Each Scout costs from $7 million to $12 million, from
start through launching.
   Since Aug. 15, 1986, when President Reagan ordered NASA out of
the commercial launch business, NASA has signed such agreements with
McDonnell Douglas, maker of Delta rockets; Martin Marietta, which
markets Titans; and General Dynamics, manufacturer of Atlas-Centaur.
   Each agreement is followed by others that convey the right to use
government launch pads on a cost-reimbursable basis.
   American launch companies have contracts worth nearly $1 billion
to launch 18 payloads through 1992. All the agreements were reache operational
success rate of 95 percent, including
37 successful launches in a row between 1967 and 1975.
   Originally, the 75-foot-tall Scout could put a 131-pound payload
into a 300-mile-high orbit. Today's rocket can lift 450 pounds into
that orbit.

<HEAD>FDIC Reduces Stake in Continental Illinois Below 50 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said
Thursday it sold more than $275 million of its stock in Continental
Illinois Corp., reducing its stake in the company to less than 50
percent.
   The FDIC, which insures deposits of up to $100,000 in commercial
banks, paid a record $4.5 billion to rescue the failing Chicago bank
holding company in 1984.
   The agency announced it sold 50 million shares of Continental
stock at $5.25 each to an underwriting syndicate managed by Goldman,
Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. and Dean Witter Capital Markets. It expects to net $250 million
from the transaction.
   The underwriters have the option of purchasing an additional 7.5
million shares.
   Also, the FDIC agreed to sell 5.2 million shares to Continental
Illinois' employee stock ownership plan for $27.2 million.
   By eventually selling all of the stock and bad loans acquired in
the rescue, FDIC expects to reduce its loss on Continental to $1.7
billion.
   In November 1986, it sold 52.5 million shares, also for $5.25 per
share.
   The latest sale reduces the agency's share of outstanding common
stock from 61.5 percent to 25.6 percent. Its overall ownership
position, which includes options for a pool of stock representing
the interests of the bank's original shareholders, is being reduced
to 39.6 percent.

   Textron Inc. announced Thursday that it
would sell its Gorham Division to Dansk International Designs Ltd.
for an undisclosed price.
   The sale, which Textron said it expected to complete by the end
of the year, would affect about 525 employees at the division's
headquarters in Johnston, a manufacturing plant in Smithfield and a
distribution center in Williamsport, Md.
   Textron announced its intention to sell the Gorham Division in
August, saying it was refocusing its commercial products sector and
wanted to focus more on aerospace products and financial services.
   Gorham, which makes tableware, was founded in 1831 and was
acquired by Textron in 1967. Dansk, of Mount Kisco, N.Y., is a
privately held company that also manufactures tableware.
   The Textron announcement said Dansk would operate Gorham as a
wholly owned subsidiary, Gorham Inc., and Brian O'Malley would
continue as president.
   D.R. Ryan Jr., the president and chief executive of Dansk, would
become Gorham's chairman, the announcement said.

<HEAD>Owner Of Securities Firm Barred From Business For Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of a securities firm that helped
underwrite the ill-fated Washington Public Power Supply System bonds
has been barred from the securities business for life, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday.
   SEC Administrative Law Judge Max O. Regensteiner barred Donald T.
Sheldon, 49, owner of two now out-of-business firms that were based
in New York City: Donald Sheldon & Co. Inc. and Donald Sheldon
Government Securities Inc.
   The two firms used customers' securities as collateral for the
firms' loans, engaged in business while insolvent, placed misleading
advertisements, made ``misrepresentations'' to customers and charged
excessive mark-ups, the SEC said, charging violations from 1982
through 1985 of anti-fraud provisions of federal securities laws.
   Bruce W. Reid, the manager of the firms' Houston office, was also
barred from the securities business, but can reapply for a
broker-dealer's license after two years. Gregory L. Pattison, a
salesman in the Houston office, was suspended for 45 days.
   In the WPPSS bond case, Sheldon and Pattison were accused of
misrepresenting the safety of the bonds. The power supply system, a
consortium of 15 utilities, defaulted on $2.25 billion of bonds
issued to finance the building of two nuclear power plants.
   In addition to New York and Houston, Sheldon's firms, which were
forced into liquidation in July 1985, had offices in Pompano Beach,
Fla.; Miami; Los Angeles and Honolulu, the SEC said.

   The Justice Department announced Thursday it
intends to file a civil suit to block TBG Inc.'s proposed
acquisition of Chase Brass & Copper Co. of Solon, Ohio.
   The department said in a statement it had notified the companies
of its plans and that a lawsuit would allege that the $127 million
transaction would violate federal antitrust law because it might
substantially reduce competition in the production and sale of free
cutting brass rod.
   Chase is a wholly owned subsidiary of BP America Inc. of
Cleveland, which is owned by British Petroleum PLC of London. TBG, a
wholly owned subsidiary of a Netherlands Antilles trust, owns the
Extruded Metals Co. of Belding, Mich.
   The top four companies making free cutting brass rod in the
United States include Chass and Extruded and command over 75 percent
of the U.S. market.
   Chase's share of the $514 million in 1987 U.S. sales of free
cutting brass rod was about 29 percent. Extruded's was about 13
percent.
   Machine shops make free cutting brass rod into a variety of
plumbing fixtures and other building construction materials, parts
for industrial equipment and machinery and vehicular parts and
components.

<HEAD>Lawyers Argue Wal-Mart Sanctions Case Before Appeals Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. asked
an appeals court Thursday to overturn a lower court's ruling that
the company pay as much as $1 million a day because its billionaire
chairman Sam Walton did not show up for a deposition.
   The 2nd Court of Appeals has not yet ruled on the case, a court
official said.
   The sanctions resulted from a personal injury lawsuit filed by
Andrew Carrizales against Wal-Mart and manager Jerry Rand.
Carrizales claims that while shopping at the company's Sulphur
Springs store in 1986 he slipped and fell on clear oil spilled on
the floor.
   Carrizales says he suffered mental anguish and ``serious and
disabling'' injuries to his arms, legs and back, the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram reported.
   Wallace Craig, Carrizales' attorney, said Wal-Mart was ordered to
produce Walton, who is also Wal-Mart's chief executive officer, for
a videotaped deposition in Bentonville, Ark., at the company's main
offices on Aug. 8.
   However, Walton's attorney petitioned a district judge in Benton
County in Arkansas to overrule the order of 352nd District Judge
John Street and requested the deposition be overseen by an Arkansas
court.
   Craig said he had no objections to conducting the deposition at
the Wal-Mart offices, but said he did not believe the testimony
would be admissible if it were taken by an Arkansas court reporter.
He also said the case is not under the jurisdiction of Arkansas
courts.
   ``I wanted to take his deposition where I was supposed to, and he
refused,'' Craig said.
   Street later ordered Wal-Mart to have Walton at the Fort Worth
court on Nov. 28 for a deposition or pay Carrizales for each day he
didn't show up.
   ``Walton ... has shown an arrogant disregard for the authority of
this court,'' the judge's ruling said. ``As chairman of the board of
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Walton owed the duties of obedience and loyal
behavior'' to the corporation to appear for the deposition.
   Street also ordered Wal-Mart's pleadings in the case stricken,
thereby knocking out the company's defenses in the suit, Craig said.
   Wal-Mart was ordered by Street to pay the plaintiff $10,000 for
the first day he did not appear; $20,000 for the second; $40,000 for
the third; $80,000 for the fourth; $160,000 for the fifth; $320,000
for the sixth; $640,000 for the seventh; $1.28 million for the
eighth; and $1 million a day for each day afterward.
   The appeals court stayed that order before Walton was scheduled
to appear in Fort Worth, Wal-Mart attorney Vic Anderson said, and
Thursday's appellate hearing was scheduled.
   Anderson said Texas law states that anyone who is not a party in
a lawsuit is able to provide a deposition in that case where they
live. Anderson declined to comment on the legal aspects of the suit.
   Craig said the personal injury suit is scheduled to go to trial
Monday.

<DATELINE>SAUSALITO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city of Sausalito, known for its
waterfront charm and posh hillside homes, will become ``America's
first cholesterol-free city,'' the mayor pledged Thursday.
   At a crowded news conference where a table groaning with fresh
fruits and vegetables was prominently displayed, Mayor Robin Sweeney
admitted ``cholesterol-free'' was an impossible goal but a more than
worthy ploy in the battle against the chief suspect in America's No.
1 killer, heart disease.
   ``This was done in the spirit of trying to get get the public's
attention, getting their awareness up ... if it gets a few laughs
along the way, that's all right,'' said the mayor, adding that the
phrase ``cholesterol-free'' should not be taken literally.
   The Sausalito City Council passed a proclamation this week to
fight fatty deposits in the blood, calling on restaurants in the
city across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco to do their
part.
   Gary W. Doring, manager of the Spinnaker Restaurant, where the
news conference was staged, said his menu will include low- or
no-cholesterol items on the menu, including fresh fruit plates,
broiled chicken, margarine in lieu of butter, and alternatives to
fried and sauteed foods.
   Excessive deposits of cholesterol on the walls of blood vessels
have been implicated in atherosclerosis, or hardening of the
arteries, which can result in blood clots, heart attacks and strokes.
   ``It's pretty hard to eat a diet that's totally free of
cholesterol,'' said cardiologist and University of California
Professor Dr. James R. Adams, a member of the cholesterol-fighting
committee.
   ``What we'd like to do,'' he declared, ``is keep the amount of
fat that you eat less than 30 percent (of the diet.) The average
American probably eats 35 to 40 percent of his calories in fat.
   ``We're trying to get people aware of what their cholesterol
(levels are) and their fat intake is so they can get their
cholesterol down and prevent heart disease. People need to be aware
of what they are putting in their bodies.''
   Ironically, several of the civic leaders at the news conference
confided that they had total cholesterol levels, in some cases, far
higher than the recommended maximum 200 milligrams. Two men said
they had 300 readings, and one said his was 269. The doctor said his
cholesterol level was a healthful 190.
   The city's cholesterol-free campaign was aimed at lowering the
public's LDL, or ``bad'' cholesterol levels. A cholesterol known as
HDL, or ``good'' cholesterol, has been shown to carry away fat
deposits from artery walls.
   Cholesterol screening tests usually measure a person's overall
cholesterol levels.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Feds Not to Blame for Princeton-Newport Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani firmly denied on
Thursday that the racketeering indictment of five top officials of
Princeton-Newport Partners pushed the firm into liquidation.
   ``The U.S. government doesn't have any responsibility for
creating a business or destroying a business,'' Giuliani said in
reply to reporters' questions about a published report.
   The Wall Street Journal, in reporting on the firm's liquidation
announcment, quoted officials and lawyers as blaming the demise of
the investment partnership on the indictment.
   Last August five Princeton-Newport partners and a former Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. trader were charged with a racketeering scheme
that allegedly engaged in generating phony tax losses through bogus
securities trading.
   It was the first time officials of a securities firm were charged
with violating federal racketeering laws.
   Neither Drexel nor Princeton-Newport was charged with criminal
activity.
   ``The government has succeeded in destroying Princeton-Newport,''
said defense attorney Paul R. Grand, according to the Journal's
Thursday editions.
   Giuliani called Grand's charge ``ridiculous'' and
``irresponsible.''
   ``That's their problem to deal with. I don't accept the premise
that we destoyed the business,'' said Giuliani.
   A week after the indictment was handed up, prosecutors _ as
required by federal rules _ informed the judge they planned a
superseding indictment, that might include additional defendants or
additional charges.
   But the government has twice pushed back the planned date for
bringing a superseding indictment.
   ``Postponing that decision repeatedly for several months created
too much uncertainty for the business,'' Grand told the Journal.
   On Monday, most of the investors gave notice they were pulling
out a substantial part of the $200 million total investment, another
defense lawyer, Diana Parker, told the Journal.
   But Giuliani countered: `'We can't determine the effect that (an
indictment) is going to have in the marketplace, any more than we
can't predict the effect of an indictment on an election.''

   The Washington State Supreme Court agreed
Thursday to hear new arguments in a civil case in which the state is
accused of fraud and negligence by holders of defaulted Washington
Public Power Supply System bonds.
   The high court provided no details in its brief order, and did
not set a date for arguments in the class-action suit, Hoffer vs.
Washington.
   Last May, justices voted 5-4 in ruling the state must defend
itself against the charges, brought by representatives of the
approximately 40,000 holders of $2.25 billion in bonds for WPPSS
nuclear power plants Nos. 4 and 5.
   In a separate development Thursday, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said the owner of a securities firm that helped
underwrite the ill-fated WPPSS bonds has been barred from the
securities business for life.
   SEC Administrative Law Judge Max O. Regensteiner barred Donald T.
Sheldon, 49, owner of two now-defunct firms that were based in New
York City: Donald Sheldon & Co. Inc. and Donald Sheldon Government
Securities Inc.
   WPPSS defaulted on the bonds in 1983, after the state Supreme
Court ruled that Washington utilities lacked the authority to
contract with WPPSS for construction of the plants. A total of 88
Northwest utilities participated in construction of the plants,
which were terminated when partially complete in January 1982.
   The bondholders, led by Arthur Hoffer of New York, allege that
the state auditor negligently performed, or failed to perform, his
duty to audit the supply system and to examine bond resolutions that
investors depend upon.
   The suit also contends that the auditor certification of the
bonds contained fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations and that
the state's participation in the decision to terminate the plants
constituted interference with the contractual relations between the
supply system and bondholders.
   In the majority opinion written in May, Justice Barbara Durham
wrote that bondholders ``should be allowed the opportunity to
present evidence concerning the certificate's objective, and the
effect it would produce on the ordinary reader.''
   However, she conceded that the auditor's certificate and letter
did not include an explicit assurance of the supply system's
financial health.
   WPPSS No. 4 was built at the Hanford nuclear reservation in
Eastern Washington, while No. 5 was built at Satsop, west of
Olympia. The plants were each less than 25 percent complete when
they were abandoned because the electricity they would have produced
was no longer needed, and because of cost overruns and other
problems.

   A jury on Thursday found that Pillsbury Co.
sustained nearly $50 million in losses in 1984 to 1986 due to
publicity regarding use of the pesticide ethylenedibromide, better
known as EDB, Pillsbury said.
   The Hennepin County District Court jury's decision is the result
of claims by Pillsbury against five insurance companies seeking
restitution for its losses. The case involves a $150 million
insurance policy issued by National Union Fire Insurance Co., Royal
Indemnity Co., Employers Mutual Casualty Co., Home Insurance Co. and
Federal Insurance Co., as well as a sixth company now in insolvency
proceedings.
   Lawyers for the insurance companies could not immediately be
reached for comment.
   The policy, issued to Pillsbury in 1983, was designed to protect
food companies against losses such as those due to publicity
surrounding the discovery of potentially toxic materials in a food
product.

<NOTE>EDS: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with reaction to Miyazawa
resignation; later Nikkei average; No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. dollar remained weaker against the Japanese
yen Friday following Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's resignation,
while share prices rebounded slightly on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar, which opened at 122.20 yen, was changing hands at
122.33 yen at midday, down 0.69 yen from Thursday's close of 123.02
yen. It moved in a range of 122.10 yen to 122.45 yen.
   The Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues, a 291.92-point
loser Thursday, edged up 10.76 points, or 0.04 percent, to finish
the morning session at 29,769.66.
   The dollar began trading sharply lower in Tokyo following an
overnight plunge in New York, where it closed at 122.28 yen, down
1.40 yen.
   The dollar's fall in New York was attributed to dealers'
disappointment about a still unclear U.S. reaction to Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's pledge at the United Nations to unilaterally
reduce Soviet troops and cut the number of Soviet conventional
weapons.
   In Tokyo, anticipation of Miyazawa's resignation Friday left many
currency dealers waiting on the sidelines, said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa
of Daiwa Bank.
   ``Many traders speculate that the resignation of Miyazawa, who
has opposed a weaker dollar, would damage current international
monetary coordination,'' said Kinugasa. ``That gave the market
strong bearish sentiments toward the dollar today.''
   Miyazawa, who had hinted at his resignation earlier, formally
announced he was stepping down to help clear opposition to tax
reform legislation under discussion in Parliament.
   The announcement of Miyazawa's resignation came just as the stock
market ended its morning session.
   Share prices rose slightly but were mixed. Many investors were
inclined to sit on the sidelines following Thursday's sharp fall,
said a dealer with a major securities firm, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, implicated in a
stock trading scandal that has damaged the governing party, resigned
Friday to help clear opposition to passage of tax reform bills in
parliament.
   Miyazawa said an aide's involvement in buying unlisted shares of
a real estate company had led him to make ``inaccurate'' statements
to lawmakers. He said he was resigning to take responsibility and
hoped the move would speed passage of the tax legislation.
   ``Personally, I hope the tax reform bills will be passed soon,
and it doesn't matter what happens to me,'' he said during an
interview on national television.
   Miyazawa told reporters Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita approved
of his resignation. Japan's Kyodo News Service, quoting unidentified
sources, said Takeshita will temporarily serve as finance minister
until a replacement is found for Miyazawa.
   Opposition parties have demanded that Miyazawa resign to take
responsibility for repeatedly giving conflicting accounts about his
role in the stock trading scandal, refusing to resume parliamentary
debate on the tax reform package until he does so.
   The two-term finance minister and veteran politician changed
accounts of his involvement in the stock deals at least three times
in his statements to parliamentary committees investigating the
scandal.
   The Recruit scandal involves questionable purchases of stocks of
Recruit Cosmos Co. by dozens of influential politicians, including
Miyazawa, Takeshita and former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe _
Japan's top three politicians.
   Political analysts have said Miyazawa's resignation would
probably pave the way for passage of the tax reform package during
the current parliamentary session, which ends on Dec. 29.
   Miyazawa, who has been considered a candidate for prime minister,
told a news conference in September, when his involvement in the
scandal was first revealed, that he took no part in the scandal and
had no knowledge about the controversial unlisted shares of the real
estate company.
   Later, an investigation by the Japanese Communist Party revealed
that Miyazawa had bought 10,000 unlisted shares of Recruit Cosmos in
September 1986 and earned more than 20 million Japanese yen, or
around $164,000, in profits by selling them immediately after the
company went public a month later.
   Miyazawa then told the committee that his former aide bought
shares from his business associate without his knowledge.
   It was disclosed in a parliamentary investigation last month that
the aide, Tsuneo Hattori, bought shares directly from Recruit Inc.,
the real estate firm's parent company.
   Miyazawa told a news conference last week that he would give up
his Cabinet position and his seat in parliament, which he has held
since 1959, if he was obliged to change his testimony again. He also
hinted that he was willing to resign if it would help secure passage
of the tax reform package.
   Debate on the tax legislation has been stalled since last week,
when opposition parties singled out Miyazawa and demanded that the
finance minister submit material evidence to prove the accuracy of
his earlier statements.
   Miyazawa, however, refused to do so, saying he had lost all
evidence such as stock transaction records and receipts.
   The legislation, Japan's first major overhaul of its tax system
since the end of World War II, has been a top priority for the
Liberal Democratic Party for a decade.
   Successive administrations have failed to enact the reform due to
public and opposition party resistance. Former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone, under whom Miyazawa also served as finance
minister, staked his political career on tax reform and lost.
   The new package simplifies corporate and personal income tax
scales and introduces a 3 percent sales tax.
   The governing party, which commands a majority in both houses of
parliament, forced the tax bill through the lower house last month.
The legislation has been debated in the upper house since then.
   The Liberal Democrats could enact the tax laws despite opposition
resistance. But this would violate Japanese political tradition,
which values consensus, and could cost the party votes in the next
election, said Masumi Ishikawa, political commentator for the
mass-circulation daily Asahi Shimbun.
   A survey by another leading daily, the Mainichi Shimbun, showed
Friday that public support for the Takeshita administration has
dropped to 18 percent from last December's 30 percent _ the
third-lowest rating for a prime minister since World War II.
