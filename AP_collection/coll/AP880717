   The air-conditioned walkway was the extravagance
most appreciated by the Democratic political leaders and Washington
media elite lingering by the mock newsstand bars at the Atlanta
newspapers' welcoming party Sunday night.
   ``Even the Ringling Brothers' tent isn't air conditioned,'' one
guest marveled at the Cox Enterprises Inc. party on the eve of the
Democratic National Convention.
   Dozens of invitation-only affairs and 56 parties for individual
state delegations kept thousands of delegates and journalists
entertained on the hot and humid day.
   Prospective Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis and
his family attended Ted Turner's crowded party at CNN Center, next
door to the convention site, before joining a family reunion hosted
by his cousin, Atlanta restaurateur Pano Karatassos.
   Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, dining at a separate party at
Karatassos' 103 West, stopped by to greet the families of Dukakis
and his vice presidential choice, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   Meanwhile, Jesse Jackson's fans jammed the ornate Fox Theater
for a fund-raising jazz and gospel concert, listening to music by
Nat King Cole's brother Freddie, an Atlanta resident, and others
for three hours before Jackson and his family arrived to rally the
faithful.
   Frigid air pumped into a tent spanning the short walkway between
the Woodruff Arts Center and the High Museum of Art cooled the
3,000 politicians and media honchos attending ``A Special Edition
Of Southern Hospitality,'' hosted by the parent company for The
Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution.
   The media chain, founded by 1920 Democratic presidential nominee
James Cox, apparently spared little expense for its party, filling
the tent and the lobbies of both buildings with bars and tables
overflowing with home-grown delicacies such as peach cheesecake.
   Sunday's partying completed a weekend of carousing by about
35,000 journalists, lobbyists, staffers, elected officials and
political junkies who have descended on Atlanta for the convention,
which opens Monday.
   All night Saturday, hotels were hopping, bars were packed and
lines extended out of dozens of nightclubs and restaurants along
Peachtree Street long past the normal closing time of 2 a.m.
   The horse-drawn carriages in the downtown hotel district were
doing a booming business as hundreds of people wandered streets
normally occupied in the early morning hours by the now-scarce
homeless.
   An overflow crowd from a heavy metal nightclub spilled onto
nearby railroad tracks, halting a train loaded with revelers. But
neither party missed a beat as the train retreated.
   Private parties ranged from a formal dinner-dance at the home of
Anne Cox Chambers, former U.S. ambassador to Belgium and chairwoman
of Atlanta Newspapers Inc., to an old fashioned ``stump speakin'''
with a real stump, mint juleps and ham biscuits, given by Betty
Talmadge, former wife of former Sen. Herman Talmadge, and Liz
Carpenter, former press secretary to Lady Bird Johnson.
   The biggest affair was a rock 'n' roll extravaganza for about
10,000 journalists at the Georgia World Congress Center, featuring
plenty of free liquor and dozens of dishes, ranging from hot dogs
and egg rolls to Brunswick stew and jambalaya.
   Bandstands scattered throughout the huge exhibition hall
showcased such acts as jazz artist Grover Washington,
rhythm-and-blues duo Ashford and Simpson and folk rocker Stephen
Stills.
   In a brief greeting, Mayor Andrew Young extended a special
welcome to the kid reporters for the Children's Express, whom he
called ``the only uncorrupted, honest, unbiased'' journalists in
the hall.
   Clearly he had missed seeing the Express reporter who raided a
fruit display, plopping whole pineapples into a plastic bag.
   ``We might get hungry later,'' the boy said.
   Atlanta's black community hosted a party for more than 250 black
elected officials from across the country at the white-columned
mansion of Atlanta businessman Nathaniel Goldston.
   Many of those revelers then joined former Atlanta Mayor Maynard
Jackson on his ``Midnight Train To Georgia,'' a fund-raiser on the
state-owned New Georgia Railroad to benefit Jackson's 1989 campaign
for another stint as mayor.
   Baseball stars Hank Aaron and Willie Stargell were among the
``celebrity conductors'' at a pre-ride party at the historic
Georgia Freight Depot, one of the city's few surviving pre-Civil
War buildings, before the train chugged out of the depot for an
18-mile loop around the city.
   During the trip, the crowd from Metroplex, a heavy metal
nightclub near, spilled onto the tracks. Rather than break up a
good party, the train turned around. Few at Jackson's party noticed
the difference.
   The ``in event'' Saturday probably was former President Jimmy
Carter's party for what he called ``my old friends _ and I use the
word carefully _ in the White House press corps.''

<HEAD>Record Heat Bakes Both Coasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Record-breaking heat scorched both coasts Sunday, wilting
several major league pitchers and sending residents in the normally
cool San Francisco Bay area streaming to the beaches.
   The mercury soared to a record 103 degrees in downtown San
Francisco. It was the city's highest temperature since record
keeping began 125 years ago, exceeding the previous mark of 102
degrees set on Oct. 5, 1987.
   On the East Coast, Philadelphia hit a record high for the date
of 102 degrees, which was also a record fifth day in a row of
triple-digit highs. Downtown Baltimore set a record high for the
date of 103 degrees.
   In California, the heat heightened the danger of fire and and
led officials to close Mount Diablo State Park in Contra Costa
County, east of San Francisco, and parts of Mount Tamalpais,
northwest of the city, officials said.
   By noon, the parking lot at Marin County's Stinson Beach was
jammed, and motorists inched along several miles of roads leading
to the area.
   National Weather Service forecasters said tempertures won't fall
to normal levels in the 80s until Thursday. Forecaster Daryl
Williams blamed the heat on a high-pressure area over the
southwestern United States, which he said is keeping cooler Pacific
air out of the area.
   Temperatures also soared above 100 in the inland valleys of
southern California, sending many to the beaches despite chilly and
overcast coastal conditions.
   About 100,000 people hit the sands at Zuma Beach, where the
temperature was about 70 degrees on the beach and in the water,
said lifeguard John Renaud. Crowds also were heavy at Santa Monica,
Venice, Will Rogers and Topanga beaches despite morning
temperatures of around 69 degrees and fog that reduced visibility
to a mere 100 years, said lifeguard Lt. Dick Heineman.
   ``It was so hot in the valley areas, they just came to the beach
anyway,'' he said.
   In Baltimore, two major league baseball teams were able to score
nine runs despite the searing heat, and the visiting pitcher
refused to take off his long-sleeved undershirt during the game,
saying he was superstitious.
   Frank Viola of the Minnesota Twins became the first American
League pitcher to win 15 games this season by surviving the minimum
five innings and leading his team to a 7-2 victory over the
Baltimore Orioles.
   ``That was the hottest situation I've ever pitched in,'' Viola
said.
   Starting pitchers in Oakland, Calif., and Boston also tired
early in the heat.
   Other record highs were 97 at Allentown, Pa.; 100 at Charleston,
W.Va.; 100 at Newark, N.J.; 98 in downtown Oakland; 97 at Raleigh,
N.C.; and 107 at San Jose and 104 at Santa Rosa, Calif.
   ``Lemonade Lassies'' in shorts will be dispensing cool drinks on
street corners in Bluefield, W.Va., again Monday after the
Appalachian town sweltered through a weekend with highs of over 90
degrees.
   Bluefield bills itself as ``Nature's Air-Conditioned City'' and
hands out free drinks whenever the mercury tops 90. The Chamber of
Commerce has gone whole summers in past years without doling out a
drop of lemonade, but this summer the heat is sending the civic
group to the poorhouse, chamber member Eddie Steele said.
   ``We've had to do it about five or six times, which is the most
we've had in 10 or 15 years,'' Steele said. ``It costs about $100 a
time to serve it.''
   Ohio officials blamed high heat as the likely cause of last
week's death of a 2-year-old girl whose body was found in a
sweltering attic.
   Lorain County deputy coroner Dr. Richard Buchannan said the body
of Ashley Kasubienski was discovered by her parents Friday. Initial
tests showed the child was ``severely dehydrated,'' and the death
appeared to be heat-related, he said.
   In Pasadena, Calif., authorities confiscated dozens of rabbits,
pigeons, chickens and geese after finding about 20 animals that had
died after having been purchased at an auction and stuffed inside
cardboard boxes for a sweltering truck ride, police said.
   Authorities were investigating possible animal cruelty charges
against three unidentified people, police Sgt. John Olquin said.

   Democratic presidential nominee-in-waiting
Michael Dukakis, declaring that ``for the last 17 months I've had
Georgia on my mind,'' arrived with his running mate on Sunday after
dismissing last-minute convention controversies simply as ``the
stuff of politics.''
   His first public appearance in the convention city was at a
party across the street from the hall where he will become his
party's presidential nominee.
   ``We're going to come out of this convention a unified party, an
inspired party,'' he said.
   ``We're going to need your help, we're going to need Jesse,'' he
added in a pointed reference to Jesse Jackson, who, so far, has
withheld an endorsement of Dukakis and his designated running mate,
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   Dukakis canceled appearances scheduled for Monday morning and
the expectation was he would be meeting with Jackson in an effort
to resolve their differences.
   ``We have come a long, long way together,'' said Dukakis. ``And
now we're in the final stretch.''
   When he arrived at the Atlanta airport, the Massachusetts
governor predicted ``a good convention and a strong and unified
party.''
   ``We're delighted to be here,'' Dukakis said as he and Bentsen
and their families flew in on a charter flight from Boston, via
Washington, on Presidential Airways.
   ``We hope and expect to launch a winning campaign,'' said the
man who will lead the Democrats against George Bush in the fall.
Bentsen was predicting as much, saying that the Democrats had more
unity now than any time in the past 20 years and adding, ``The tide
is really moving with us.''
   The Dukakis plane stopped in Washington just long enough for the
Texas senator and his wife B.A. to board the plane. Dukakis has
chosen Bentsen as his running mate and he introduced the
silver-haired politician as the ``next president of the United
States,'' before quickly correcting himself to say ``vice
president.''
   On the eve of the opening of the Democratic National Convention,
Dukakis expressed confidence that Jackson will be a member of his
team but emphasized that it will have only one quarterback _ the
presidential nominee.
   ``You can't have two quarterbacks,'' he told a Boston news
conference before leaving for Atlanta.
   He rejected the idea that he was angered or frustrated by
Jackson's reaction to the selection of Bentsen. Jackson had openly
sought the vice presidential nomination.
   ``This is the stuff of politics,'' he said.
   ``I'm on my way to a convention where, if everything goes well,
I'm going to be the Democratic presidential nominee. That's never
happened to me before.
   ``I'm looking forward to the week.''
   Dukakis said he and Jackson talked by telephone Sunday morning,
but he refused to discuss the conversation or speculate on when
they would sit down together in Atlanta.
   ``We know each other, we like each other, we respect each
other,'' Dukakis said of his relationship with Jackson.
   ``No Democratic convention would be a Democratic convention
without a little controversy,'' he said, trying to minimize the
prospects for disruption by the Jackson forces.
   The Massachusetts governor said he still has no idea whether
Jackson will challenge his choice of Bentsen.
   ``I would hope it wouldn't be,'' he replied when asked if
Jackson's name would be offered to the convention as an alternative
to Bentsen.
   Jackson so far has refused to rule out such a possibility.
   ``He's a member of the team,'' Dukakis said of Jackson ``and a
good Democrat besides. An important member of the team.''
   But, he said, ``Every team has to have a quarterback. That's the
nominee.''
   As for a meeting with Jackson in Atlanta, Dukakis would only
say, ``We meet when we decide to meet.''
   ``We've had a remarkably good relationship,'' he said. ``This
has been as quiet and as happy a Democratic race as any I can
remember.''
   He said Jackson's involvement ``as an active campaigner would be
a tremendous asset.''
   Dukakis also completed action on state budget matters, including
using his line item veto to delete $138 million in spending.
   The action enabled the governor to head for Atlanta with his
state budget in balance.
   In the evening, Dukakis, Bentsen and their families celebrated
their first night in Atlanta at a dinner hosted by a cousin of
Dukakis, local restaurateur Pano Karatassos.
   Karatassos is a second cousin of Dukakis, said Elaine
LaMontagne, a spokeswoman for the restaurant, 103 West. Their
grandmothers were first cousins, she said.

   Escalating strife in Nicaragua is sending
familiar ripples through Washington, where Congress appears headed
for yet another fractious confrontation over U.S. policy in the
region.
   Riding a crest of anti-Sandinista sentiment in Congress, Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., introduced legislation last week
to provide a new $47 million in aid _ $20 million of it in weapons
_ to the Contra rebels fighting the leftist regime in Managua.
   The rebels have been without new U.S. military aid since
February, and have been making do with the $17 million for food and
clothing that Congress provided in earlier legislation. The
humanitarian aid was designed to enhance peace talks which
collapsed June 9. The talks have not gotten back on track.
   The Reagan administration's strategy appears to be to get some
version of the Dole aid bill passed in the more favorable climate
of the Senate, as an amendment to a Pentagon money bill. That could
happen soon after Congress returns July 26 from its break for the
Democratic National Convention.
   The measure then would go to a House-Senate negotiating
committee, where the Contra aid amendment would be among the items
subject to bargaining. Members of the House negotiating team, such
as Reps. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., and John Murtha, D-Pa., look more
favorably on Contra aid than the full House, and are seen as likely
to accept the Senate provision.
   That would mean House members, who have narrowly rejected Contra
military aid in the last several showdowns, would be faced with a
vote on an entire Pentagon spending package that includes aid to
the rebels as a small section of the bill.
   Democratic strategists concede the aid is far more likely to
pass in that form, since it would be easier to get a yes vote from
the three dozen or so ``swing'' members _ most of them Democrats _
who traditionally hold the balance of power on the issue.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, the leading congressional
critic of the administration's Contra policy, was seeking to
arrange a resumption of the peace talks. He said while he would not
oppose an extension of humanitarian aid to the rebels, ``I don't
think there exists in Congress a desire to resume the war.''
   But chances for the new military aid could be enhanced even
further if conditions inside Nicaragua continue to deteriorate.
Last week's moves by the Sandinista government to suppress
opposition demonstrations and close independent media outlets
brought virtually unanimous condemnation from Congress, in the form
of harshly worded resolutions.
   Since the resolutions were passed, the government has sentenced
opposition leaders arrested at a rally to six months in jail, and
has confiscated a sugar plantation that was the country's largest
private business.
   Nicaragua also expelled U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and seven
colleagues last week.
   The outcome of the newest Contra aid push will depend largely on
what the Sandinistas do in the weeks ahead, said Rep. Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., the party's chief House vote counter.
   If Managua begins to restore democratic freedoms, ``the
shrillness, the sharpness of the bitterness will have calmed
down,'' Coelho said recently.
   The Sandinista crackdowns have demonstrated a lack of concern
about the peace process in the region, Coelho said. ``If it looks
like they're thumbing their noses at the process, you're going to
have people supporting some alternative.''
   Dole's bill includes $20 million in military aid for the rebels,
but makes it more palatable to congressional moderates by leaving
the aid in escrow. It would flow only if requested by President
Reagan, and only if Congress passes another bill authorizing the
weapons money.
   The Reagan administration bitterly opposed such a congressional
``trigger'' in the last aid battle, but now believes the mere
threat of lethal aid may be enough to drive the Sandinistas to
concessions, according to one senior administration official.
   The official also pointed out that the prospects for new aid may
be further enhanced because the Democratic vice presidential
candidate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, is a consistent supporter
of Contra military aid.

   In the midst of the nation's war on drugs,
a plant in this suburban community quietly imports coca leaves and
processes them into medicinal cocaine and a non-narcotic flavor
extract for Coca-Cola.
   Workers at the Stepan Co. plant, the nation's only legal
importer of cocaine, must undergo strict background checks, and
agents from the federal Drug Enforcement Agency frequently visit,
said plant manager John O'Brien.
   DEA spokesman Milton Smilek in Newark said there haven't been
any security problems at the plant just west of New York City. He
said it processes hundreds of tons of cocaine each year.
   The company imports coca leaf from Peru and to a lesser extent
from Bolivia, O'Brien said.
   Part of what Stepan extracts from the coca leaf is sold to
Mallinckrodt Inc., a St. Louis-based pharmaceutical company.
   Mallinckrodt further purifies the extract into pharmaceutical
grade cocaine hydrochloride, used as a local anesthetic by eye, ear
and nose specialists, said company spokeswoman Roxanna Motchan.
   Mallinckrodt also is subject to stringent DEA requirements,
including background checks of employees, she said.
   Carlton Curtis, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in its Atlanta
headquarters, said use of the coca extract in the soft drink is
common knowledge, although the company closely guards its secret
formula, first developed in 1886.
   ``We've been openly talking about that for 102 years,'' Curtis
said.
   Coca-Cola, whose name is derived from the company's use of the
coca extract, has said that before the refining process was
modernized around the turn of the century, traces of cocaine may
have made it into some drinks.
   Mayor John A. Steuert Jr. said he's unsure if most of the town's
9,900 residents know the plant processes cocaine.
   ``It's the kind of publicity I'm sure they try to avoid if they
can,'' he said.

   Bert Lance has no official role at the Democratic
convention, but Jesse Jackson will make sure there is a place at
the table for the burly Georgia politician declared persona non
grata four years ago.
   ``He's one of Jesse's kitchen cabinet,'' said longtime Jackson
adviser Frank Watkins. Watkins said Lance's public support of
Jackson helped give the Democratic presidential runner-up to
Michael Dukakis `tremendous credibility among `Democratic
established officials' and Southerners in particular.''
   Lance talks as often as four times a day to Jackson, Watkins
said, and his advice is ``sometimes accepted, sometimes not,'' but
``always candid and frank,'' and ``extremely helpful to the
candidate.''
   Beyond that, Lance and Jackson have a close personal
relationship that has been nurtured over the past four years of
political hills and valleys for both men.
   ``It's a brother relationship,'' Lance said in an interview.
``It's not so much a political relationship as it is a real
friendship. ... We're really close in the sense that we can joke
with each other and be very frank with each other.''
   The alliance between the unlikely pair _ one a fiery black
preacher and civil rights activist, the other the epitome of a
white Southern insider _ helped Lance make something of a political
comeback from troubles that began when he was director of the
Office of Management and Budget under President Carter.
   ``He got rehabilitated politically, and there's nothing wrong
with that,'' said Watkins.
   Lance left the Carter administration under a cloud of alleged
past banking irregularities, then was acquitted of those charges by
a federal jury. But he was dogged by a negative image that
resurfaced at the Democratic National Convention in 1984.
   Walter Mondale, thankful for Lance's help in the South, courted
him during the convention to head up the Democratic Party, then in
the face of party protest summarily dumped him all within a matter
of ill-timed days. Lance ultimately stepped down as chairman of
both Mondale's 1984 campaign and of the Georgia Democratic Party.
   But today it's a different story. Lance is sought out by those
looking for an inside track on the candidate who will walk into the
Atlanta convention with some 1,200 delegates in his pocket.
   In rare appearances on the campaign trail, Lance invariably was
buttonholed by reporters eager for his insight.
   He gamely sang Jackson's praises on TV news programs, giving
early assurances that Jackson was not a disruptive force but a
loyal Democrat.
   And when Jackson's campaign needed a public display of
establishment acceptability as his campaign was catching fire, it
was largely through Lance's efforts that a meeting with Democratic
leaders was arranged in Washington.
   Their friendship goes back to 1983 when Jackson began his
presidential bid. Lance had already proven himself by organizing
Southern state chairmen to go to Jackson's home base of Chicago and
campaign for Harold Washington, who became the city's first black
mayor in a bitter election against Jane Byrne.
   It was Lance whom Mondale turned to as a liaison to Jackson in
trying to deal with Jackson's various complaints about party
workings.
   Robert Beckel, who ran Mondale's 1984 campaign, recalls an early
negotiating meeting with Lance and Jackson.
   ``It was a chemistry that worked right away. They talk a lot of
grits and gravy with each other. They talk South,'' with a natural
affinity since Jackson is from South Carolina, Beckel said. ``The
two of them sit there and they'll go face to face and disagree with
each other. I've never seen two guys fight through smiling the way
those two guys do.''
   Tennessee politician John J. Hooker said their affinity stems in
part from rejection at the hands of their own party.
   ``Their relationship was born in pain. Here were two men who had
walked on the hot coals and felt that they had not been dealt with
fairly ... There's no question in my mind that Jesse Jackson is a
hero of Bert Lance and Bert Lance is a hero of Jesse Jackson,''
said Hooker.

<HEAD>Iran Asks Airbus Help In Search For Flight Recorders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has asked the European Airbus
consortium for help in its search for flight recorders from an
Iranian jetliner that was shot down by an American warship.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Sunday that
Iran's Civil Aviation Organization made the request.
   Robert Alizart, a spokesman for the Airbus Industrie consortium
in the French city of Toulouse, said the company received a telex
Wednesday from Iran asking where to buy or rent equipment to help
find the flight recorders.
   The A300 was shot down by the U.S. missile cruiser Vincennes on
July 3, and Iran said all 290 aboard were killed. U.S. military
authorities said the plane was mistaken for an attacking F-14 jet
fighter.
   The Pentagon said information gathered by the cruiser showed the
plane was descending in altitude on an ``attack profile,'' but Iran
said the plane was climbing.
   Discovery of the plane's two flight recorders in the waters of
the Strait of Hormuz could help determine the truth. Each of the
black boxes containing the recorders has a radio beacon that can
transmit for 12 to 30 days after a crash.
   Alizart says Airbus doesn't manufacture the beacons, so the
company is tracking down an agency of the British-based beacon
manufacturing company that could provide Iran Air with the
equipment it needs to detect the black boxes.
   The Iranian news agency, monitored in Cyprus, said Iranian
frogmen have searched for the recorders since the plane was shot
down.
   So far, 179 bodies have been recovered, the agency reported.

   President Saddam Hussein said Sunday that a
string of Iraqi victories on the battlefield should persuade Iran
to accept an ``honorable'' peace and end the war between the
Persian Gulf nations.
   Iraq later said its forces withdrew from an Iranian border area
after ridding it of enemy troops and bombed industrial targets in
southern Iran.
   ``Iran's rulers have to accept the peace road, they have to
abandon their unjust dreams and foolish mottos and slogans, their
hollow illusions after their defeats,'' the Iraqi leader declared
in a speech broadcast on Baghdad radio.
   Hussein's speech came on the 20th anniversary of his seizure of
power.
   He proposed that Iran and Iraq sign a peace accord, exchange
prisoners, return to their respective borders and vow not to
interfere in each other's internal affairs.
   Hussein first listed his peace plan in an open letter to the
Iranian leadership in August 1986.
   A military communique issued shortly afterward said Iraqi forces
withdrew from the Iranian town of Dehloran, which they seized
Tuesday.
   The Iraqis advanced 30 miles into Iran to capture Dehloran after
chasing Iranian forces out of the Zubaidat region on their side of
the border. Military communiques said at the time that Iraq did not
wish to hold onto Iranian territory and would withdraw from
Dehloran after clearing the border area of enemy troops and
destroying their bases.
   The Iraqi News Agency reported that Iraqi warplanes bombed fuel
storage tanks near the southern Iranian city of Ahvaz, scoring
``destructive hits.''
   There was no immediate Iranian comment on the Iraqi reports.
   Iraq's victories in Zubaidat and Dehloran were the latest in a
series of Iraqi triumphs this year that chased Iranian troops out
of almost all the Iraqi territory they had seized since 1982.
   The Iraqis began recapturing their lost territories in April.
They said they seized about 133 strategic heights in the northern
region of the 730-mile long front.
   Simultaneously, they launched assaults in the south, recapturing
the southern Faw peninsula in April and the Shalamcheh and Majnoon
islands in May and June.
   
   Hussein said these victories could lead to a peace settlement
and urged Iran to accept the U.N. Security Council call for a
cease-fire in the 8-year-old war. Iraq accepts the July 1987
resolution, but Iran maintains the conflict cannot end until Iraq
is branded the aggressor in the war.
   ``Iraq stands now on victorious ground ... confident today and
in the future. Iraqis and the noble Arabs now stand on victorious
peaks while the rulers of Iran are in the trench of defeat and
shame,'' Hussein said.
   ``Iraq extends the hand of honorable peace and calls on the
Iranian rulers to draw lessons from their defeats,'' he said.
   Hussein stressed Sunday that any settlement should guarantee
Iraq's navigation rights along the Shatt al-Arab waterway, which
forms the southernmost border with Iran, as well as through the
Strait of Hormuz, the narrow entrance to the Persian Gulf.
   Iraq's only access to the gulf along the Shatt al-Arab has been
blocked by Iran since the outbreak of fighting.

   Every time policeman Miguel Rosario
drives down San Ysidro Boulevard near the Mexican border he
remembers how it felt to be pinned down by a fusillade of bullets
from an deranged man's submachine gun.
   And he wishes he'd been the officer who fired the shot that
ended James Oliver Huberty's 77-minute rampage in a McDonald's
restaurant four years ago Monday. Huberty killed 21 people and
injured 19 before being slain.
   The restaurant was razed after the July 18, 1984, massacre _ the
nation's worst one-day mass murder by a single gunman _ and a
Southwestern College building is taking shape on the lot.
   ``Every time I go by, I look at the spot and the area where I
laid for about an hour,'' said Rosario, who was the first officer
on the scene.
   The 10-year San Diego Police Department veteran said in a recent
interview that the first call was for an assault with a deadly
weapon. He expected to find a victim of a domestic argument.
   He parked his car and began walking toward the postal building
where the victim had been reported.
   ``I looked over and I see people hiding behind cars, crouched
behind cars,'' he said, ``and I got this funny feeling in my
stomach that something was really wrong, deadly wrong.''
   ``At that time, an older guy pointed to McDonald's and I was
standing right dead in the middle of the parking lot.''
   He spotted a man with an Uzi 9mm submachine gun in the doorway.
   ``We made eye contact and he brought it up in an aiming position
and I looked for cover,'' Rosario said. ``There was this truck
right to my right there, a big truck, thank God, because I got
right behind it and it saved me.
   ``He was shooting over me, and trying to get the rounds through
the truck. At one point he tried to skip the rounds off the
ground.''
   Inside the restaurant, Huberty, 41, ordered the four dozen
patrons to lie on the floor. Armed with a small arsenal of weapons
and more than 400 rounds of ammunition, the unemployed security
guard systematically shot his victims, pausing occasionally to sip
a soft drink.
   The massacre ended when police sniper Chuck Foster fired one
shot through Huberty's chest.
   ``I would've loved to be the one,'' said Rosario. ``And I did
have him in my sights for about 10 seconds. But by the time I did
what I had to do he had moved.''
   Soon afterward, McDonald's Corp. had the restaurant razed and
donated the three-quarter-acre lot a mile from the Mexican border
to the city, with the stipulation that no restaurant be built there.
   For three years, the land was occupied only by a makeshift
shrine to the victims. Some argued a park should be built as a
permanent memorial on the site, about 20 miles south of downtown
San Diego.
   It finally was sold for about $136,000 to Southwestern College,
a community college with about 14,000 students. School officials
expect a one-story classroom and administration building to be
completed in time for the fall semester.
   The agreement calls for the school to dedicate a 300-square-foot
area in front of the building for a permanent memorial to the
victims. The college's students were invited to submit designs for
the memorial and a committee is selecting one from about 30
entries, said school spokesman Fred Carvell.
   Councilman Bob Filner, whose district includes the community of
about 17,000 people, said selling the land to the college seemed
appropriate.
   ``I think because we did something positive, the anniversary is
less of a negative thing now than it would have been,'' he said.
``People now see something positive going to happen there.''

<HEAD>Negative Information Leaked About Two Former Meese Aides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Controversy follows Attorney General Edwin
Meese III everywhere he goes _ even out the door.
   The latest installment involves the leaking of unfavorable
information about two former Justice Department officials who have
been invited to testify before a Senate panel about their former
boss.
   Committee sources and sources close to the Justice Department
say the leaks were an attempt to discourage the two men from
testifying.
   Meese's resignation by itself may have convinced one of the men,
former Deputy Attorney General Arnold I. Burns, to resist the
committee's invitation to testify about Meese. Burns reportedly
believes Meese's stewardship is now ``ancient history.''
   But former criminal division chief William F. Weld, who along
with Burns suddenly announced his resignation March 29, is still
expected to appear July 26 before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Burns and Weld left March 29 when Meese was under intense
scrutiny from independent counsel James McKay, who was
investigating Meese's conduct on a number of ethics matters.
   The Democratic-controlled Judiciary Committee invited both men
to tell why they left, but neither would consider the request
before McKay completed his work.
   McKay submitted his still-secret findings on July 5 and, on the
same day, Meese announced that he would resign in late July or
early August. The committee then committee asked Burns and Weld to
testify on July 26. McKay's report was expected to made public on
Monday.
   Robert J. (Duke) Short, a committee aide to Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., said he was asked by the committee's Democratic staffers
after Meese's resignation announcement to check whether Burns and
Weld were coming.
   According to Short, Burns told him ``the Meese story is now
ancient history, but if I'm subpoenaed, of course, I would
testify.'' A subpoena is highly unlikely, and as of now, Burns is
not expected to come.
   Weld described his conversation with Short in a startling letter
to the committee.
   Weld said that Short ``asked me whether there was an internal
Justice Department investigation of me in 1986 or 1987, based on an
anonymous letter alleging that I had smoked marijuana at a wedding
in 1982, and if so, whether that might not `complicate''' the
testimony.
   Weld pointed out an internal Justice Department investigation
found the allegation ``lacked merit,'' and in subsequent interviews
emphatically denied the marijuana incident.
   Short said he received a call about the marijuana allegation and
``asked Weld about it.''
   Asked if he was attempting to hint to Weld that he avoid
testifying, Short said in an interview, ``Absolutely not. Not under
any circumstance.''
   Furthermore, Short said, he made the calls to Weld and Burns at
the request of the Democratic committee staff because both men are
Republicans and Short knew them personally.
   Mark Gitenstein, chief counsel for the committee's Democratic
majority, supported Short. ``I don't believe Duke tried to
discourage Weld from testifying,'' he said. ``I don't believe that
was his intention.''
   But last week, the Washington Times carried a news story about
the marijuana allegation, and had previously published several
stories about Burns' efforts to get his former law partner a
federal judgeship.
   A Justice Department spokesman, Patrick Korten, said he had ``no
idea who is responsible for making any of that information
available.''
   As to the conflict-of-interest allegations, Stephen Markman, the
assistant attorney general in charge of screening judicial
candidates, said Burns was above board in his efforts on behalf of
his former partner, Stuart Summit _ now a nominee for the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   ``Obviously his name came to our attention because of his
relationship to Mr. Burns,'' Markman said. ``Mr. Burns probably
bent over backwards to make sure he wasn't viewed as pushing the
candidate to the exclusion of other candidates.
   ``Mr. Summit went through the normal procedures _ the regular
interview process, the regular background process, and final
approval by the attorney general. The attorney general was aware
that Summit was a partner of Arnie Burns. Burns' relationship with
Summit was quite open.''

<HEAD>Guerrilla Leader Says Communists Willing To Open Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A guerrilla commander said Sunday
that communist rebels are willing to open new peace talks with
President Corazon Aquino's government.
   But Gregorio Rosal, a leader of the Meliton Glor communist rebel
faction on the main Luzon Island, said the offer must not be
considered an act of surrender.
   Rosal said the military has been sabotaging reconciliation
efforts by both the rebels and the government.
   ``We are ready to hold talks for the pursuit of long-lasting
peace, but never for surrender,'' Rosal said. ``The present
government is prone to saddling (us) with terms unacceptable for
free-wheeling talks, with the military ... acting as saboteurs to
any peaceful effort.''
   The representative of the New People's Army, the outlawed armed
branch of the Communist Party, made the statement in a
tape-recorded message sent to news agencies.
   Rosal did not say on what terms the rebels were willing to
negotiate.
   Rosal also represents the National Democratic Front, a 12-member
umbrella group that includes the Communist Party and its army.
   The communists, who claim 25,000 guerrillas are fighting for
them, have been waging a war for 19 years to establish a Marxist
state in the Philippines.
   About 10,000 people Sunday celebrated the second anniversary of
the founding of Alsa Masa (People's Uprising), an anti-communist
vigilante group.
   Chanting anti-communist slogans, the demonstrators burned
effigies of the rebels.
   Five communists and a provincial leftist leader were killed and
eight soldiers were wounded in separate insurgency-related clashes
in the past four days, the state-run Philippine News Agency
reported.
   It said government troops Saturday killed five guerrillas in a
gunfight on the outskirts of the town of Magalona on Negros Island,
about 300 miles southeast of Manila.
   In Bacolod, the main city on Negros, about 6,000 people gathered
Friday in front of the Sacred Heart Seminary to protest alleged
communist infiltration of the Roman Catholic Church, the agency
reported.
   It said the crowd demanded the resignation of Bacolod Bishop
Antonio Fortich, an outspoken advocate of human rights _ including
those of the rebels _and refused to allow the prelate and about 100
others to leave the building.
   Also in Bacolod, unidentified men Thursday gunned down Nilo
Piccio, the local chairman of the New Patriotic Alliance, a leftist
group. The assailants escaped.
   In another incident, the agency said eight soldiers were wounded
Friday when their vehicle struck a land mine on Panay Island. It
said troops captured two rebels in a brief firefight after the
incident.

   Sikh militants clashed with police
Sunday in a gunfight that left three Sikhs and three police
officers dead, authorities said.
   The shooting began at about 3:30 a.m., after police tried to
break into a house in Chandigarh believed occupied by Sikh
militants, said police Superintendent R.P. Singh.
   The militants opened fire, killing Inspector Jagjit Singh and
injuring two police officers, who later died, the superintendent
said. Three militants were killed in the return fire.
   Chandigargh is the capital of Punjab state, where Sikh militants
are fighting to establish a Sikh homeland.
   In another incident in Punjab, three state employees were shot
and killed Saturday night near the city of Amritsar, the Press
Trust of India news agency reported. The victims included one Sikh
and two Hindus.
   Three moderate Sikhs were also killed by suspected militants in
other areas of Punjab on Saturday night, the agency said.
   The killings raise to 1,517 the number of people killed in
Punjab this year in the Sikhs' violent campaign.
   Sikhs form just 2 percent of India's 800 million people but are
a majority in Punjab. Radical Sikhs claim they are discriminated
against by the Hindus, who make up 80 percent of India's population.

<TEXT>
   Orthodox Jews are scouring Israel's
Mediterranean beaches for a rare snail that produces a blue dye
they say is needed to revive a religious ritual abandoned 1,500
years ago.
   The snail hunt was prompted last week by Rabbi Menachem Burstin
of Jerusalem, who is trying to recreate a process once used to dye
a single thread of the Jewish prayer shawl in accordance with a
biblical command.
   Jews were forced to abandon the practice in the fifth century,
Burstin said, when Roman authorities banned all but the ruling
class from wearing colored clothing. The recipe for the dye they
used was lost.
   ``Now we are looking for it,'' said Burstin, of the prestigious
Mercaz Harav religious seminary. ``We want to revive the mitzva
(biblical command).''
   Israel's chief rabbis, who rule on religious issues, have not
given the go-ahead to renew the ancient practice and are awaiting
Burstin's findings before they consider it, said Zalman Quittner, a
spokesman for the rabbis.
   Interest in the mollusk mystery was roused when Burstin appealed
in a religious newspaper, ``Erev Shabat,'' for seminary students to
seek out the rare snail, known as the Janthina or ``violet snail''
because of its purple-blue color.
   Burstin said he has been deluged with reports of snail
sightings. But he has so far collected only a tenth of the
``bucketful'' he says is needed to extract enough dye to test his
theory.
   The 33-year-old rabbi is trying to validate a claim made in 1920
by the late Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Isaac Halevy Herzog, father of
President Chaim Herzog.
   In a doctoral thesis at the University of London, the elder
Herzog suggested the original dye used came from the Janthina
snail. But he noted the the snail seldom made it to Israeli shores.
   This summer, however, the snails have been sighted along with
schools of jellyfish that have been plaguing beaches, Burstin said.
   Hank Mienis, curator of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
Mollusk Collection, said there are five species of the Janthina.
The largest are 1{ inches in diameter, he said.
   The ancient Jewish practice involved coloring one of eight
strands of a prayer shawl as a sign of devotion to God.
   The white prayer shawls have been worn under clothing by devout
Jewish men since the ancient Israelites roamed the desert with
Moses during their exodus from Egypt. It is customary to kiss one
of the fringes during portions of morning prayers.
   The Old Testament says that God ordered Moses:``Speak to the
children of Israel and tell them to make for themselves fringes on
the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to
put on the fringe of each corner a blue thread.
   ``You shall have it as a fringe, so that when you look upon it
you will remember to do all the commands of the Lord, and you will
not follow the desires of your heart and your eyes which lead you
astray.''
   The Talmud, which interprets Jewish law, explained how the blue
fringe should be dyed but did not give the source of the dye.
Jewish sages have speculated about the recipe, but only began
trying to revive the custom about 100 years ago in Poland, Burstin
said.
   He said a Hasidic rabbi, Gershon Hanoch Leiner of Radzin,
maintained the dye came from a squid. About 17,000 followers of
Leiner used the method, he said, and many died at the hands of the
Nazis during World War II.
   Herzog differed with Leiner's followers by suggesting the
Janthina snail, and not the squid, was the true source of the dye.
   ``I am checking Herzog's method to the end,'' said Burstin, who
has been studying the issue for 14 years. ``We cannot push this
mitzva forward until we solve this.''

<HEAD>Democratic Hispanics Establish Political Group To Boost Unity,
Clout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 150 Hispanic Democrats founded a political
group of their own Sunday in an effort to galvanize the clout of
the nation's fastest-growing minority.
   ``We're here to demonstrate to the Democratic Party that we are
a community once and for all united,'' Rep. Esteban Torres of
California, a co-chairman of the group, told the Sunday morning
gathering. ``We're coming together here for the first time and it
will not be the last.''
   The group, called National Hispanic Democrats, is made up of
Mexican-Americans, Puerto Rican-Americans and Cuban-Americans.
   About 200 of the 4,200 delegates to this week's Democratic
National Convention are Hispanic.
   Hispanics have drawn acute attention from both parties this year
because their growing vote is concentrated in key states like
California, Texas and Florida. Both Democratic presidential
candidate-to-be Michael Dukakis and his Republican counterpart
George Bush have already pledged to appoint a Hispanic cabinet
member if elected.
   The group said it hopes to capitalize on that interest.
   ``What we have here is the most serious effort in recent times
to focus the Hispanic agenda,'' Torres said. ``Our challenge is not
the differences sometimes created by national origin or regional
bias but the similarities which over shadow our differences.''
   In the past, organizers said, differences among the different
segments of the Hispanic population have kept its clout fragmented.
The new group has agreed to disagree on some issues, but agrees on
the need for improvements in education, jobs, health care and crime
fighting as well as mobilizing the Hispanic vote in November.
   ``The time is right for this to work,'' said co-chair Marife
Hernandez, a Democratic Party activist from New York. ``We're going
to make sure that we're heard.''

<TEXT>
   On the eve of the Democratic National Convention,
with 4,162 delegates watching to see what he's made of, Michael
Dukakis is still struggling with Jesse Jackson for control of a
prime-time spotlight that ought to be his without question.
   Through weeks of pre-convention jockeying, Dukakis has never
been able to get Jackson to quit gnawing at his ankle. If it isn't
one thing _ the vice presidency, a platform plank, a mediator,
partnership _ it's another.
   ``It's supposed to be his convention,'' someone mentioned to
Jackson on Sunday.
   ``That's an illusion,'' he responded. ``This is a convention of
the people. It's the delegates' convention. They will determine who
the nominee will be.''
   The nominee will be Dukakis because Dukakis beat Jackson every
Tuesday for months on end. Now the Dukakis people want the payoff:
televised unity that will provide a campaign boost in the fight
against Republican George Bush.
   ``This is the stuff of politics,'' Dukakis said Sunday in
minimizing the prospects for convention chaos. ``No Democratic
convention would be a Democratic convention without a little
controversy.''
   But Jackson has been running for president for five years _
drawing large and adoring crowds that Dukakis can only dream of _
and he is hard put to give up the limelight. He seems reluctant to
even share it.
   The week could go two ways.
   At this late date, the best Dukakis can do (and it's pretty
good) is a convention that looks like this:
   Monday: Dukakis makes a neighborhood anti-drug appearance,
pressing one of his key issues against Bush. Lloyd Bentsen does
some quiet missionary work and wins private assurances from key
Jackson supporters. A summit is arranged, Dukakis and Jackson
emerging with broad grins and little to say. Garrison Keillor sings
the national anthem and millions of TV viewers wonder if this isn't
going to be a Democratic year.
   Tuesday: Dukakis does a zillion interviews by satellite with
local TV anchors. They want to know about Jackson and he tells them
Democrats are united on the key economic issues. OK, so there's a
floor fight on the platform. The Dukakis people oppose three
Jackson planks _ no tax hike and no freeze on military spending and
no Palestinian state _ and they relish and win a showdown. The
story of the day is Jackson's speech and what a speech. Hands that
pick cotton will pick a president. The crowd is going crazy _ how
else to describe it? _ and Bentsen is somewhere fidgeting a little,
when the hysteria ends with a dramatic encore: Jackson returns to
the podium and endorses the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.
   Wednesday: It is nomination day and delegates pack the hall
after Dukakis and Bentsen attend an emotional ceremony at the
Martin Luther King Center. The roll call is a loose, bantering
competition between Dukakis people and Jackson stalwarts. Ohio or
Pennsylvania _ two key states with 48 electoral votes between them
_ compete to put Dukakis over the top. Dukakis makes a surprise
appearance, with Jackson at his side, and nomination night becomes
unity night, too.
   Thursday: The Bentsen roll call is anti-climatic after all the
delicious speculation of a Jackson challenge. Bentsen follows his
victory with a speech that lays out the case against Bush. I beat
him once and I can't wait to beat him again, Bentsen says. He tells
that wonderful Jim Wright joke: ``I like George Bush because we're
both Texans. I'm from Fort Worth and he's from Fort
Kennebunkport.'' Dukakis takes to the podium and looks taller than
he is. His is a vision of the future, upbeat. He is the son of
immigrants, proud of the path he has traveled, insistent America
can have change for the better. For the first time in months he
does not _ not _ deliver the standard lines about good jobs at good
wages, and the need for ``a real war, not a phony war'' on drugs.
That's the message, but delivered in new, more dramatic rhetoric.
Then ``A Fanfare to Michael Dukakis,'' music by John Williams,
orchestra led by Kitty's dad, Harry Ellis Dickson of the Boston
Pops.
   That assumes Jackson will stop biting Dukakis' ankle. Dukakis'
worst nightmare _ a Jackson convention _ looks like this:
   Sunday: On the eve of the Democratic National Convention,
Michael Dukakis is acting more like Rodney Dangerfield than John
Kennedy. His arrival is overshadowed by Jackson appearances in
which he tells supporters they ``deserve respect, not just an
apology.'' Paul Brountas delivers an apology, his 16th.
   Monday: Dukakis' anti-drug appearance is overshadowed by a
Jackson foray into one of Atlanta's toughest neighborhoods, where
he leads a spontaneous rally which sweeps dealers and degenerates
off the street to cheers of ``Down with dope, up with hope.''
   Tuesday: Jackson's speech sends his 1,100 delegates, and most of
Dukakis', into a frenzy. He pushes every Democratic button with a
revivalist style that simply takes over the convention. Dukakis
people stand with Jackson supporters and wave a common banner:
Dukakis-Jackson '88.
   Wednesday: Nomination day. Dukakis wins. Jackson veep fever
running high.
   Thursday: Bentsen is nominated, but so is Jackson _ he couldn't
stop the draft-Jackson movement if he tried. But things have gone
far enough _ Jackson takes to the podium, endorses Bentsen and
calls for acclamation. He has controlled the convention from the
beginning to now. Dukakis speaks. Viewers wonder _ if Jackson can
control Dukakis' convention, will he control his campaign, his
presidency?

   A group of Dominicans apparently trying
to sneak into the United States picked the wrong place to jump
ship, splashing into the water in front of the Coast Guard station,
an official said.
   ``The barge was inbound to Miami when 12 people jumped overboard
and swam for shore opposite the Coast Guard base, not the best of
all possible places,'' said Coast Guard Chief Lou Parris. ``Two
off-duty (guardsmen) were fishing on the docks opposite the base
and spotted the swimmers.''
   Five of the men were captured Saturday, still swimming, and were
turned over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   The seven others from the Dominican-registered barge and tugboat
scrambled ashore in an area lined with freight docks and were at
large late Saturday, Parris said.

   A 75-foot-high dam burst Sunday in
western India, stranding hundreds of villagers and isolating some
towns, the United News of India reported.
   The report said air force helicopters and police boats were
called in to rescue people.
   The news agency said contact could not be made with the village
of Trambau because it was isolated by waters from the burst dam. It
said 500 villagers were reported to be stranded on a hill. No loss
of life was reported, UNI said.
   The dam burst in the Rann of Kutch, a marshy area in Gujarat
state near Pakistan. It frequently dries out in the spring but
becomes almost an inland sea during the rainy season, which is
currently sweeping across India.
   The dam burst at Mithi in western Kutch, UNI said.

   Their relationship didn't work out in the
script, but in real life they clicked. Actor Michael J. Fox and his
one-time TV girlfriend Tracy Pollan were married at a country inn
over the weekend.
   Fox, 26, and Pollan, 27, were wed Saturday, his publicist, Nanci
Ryder, said Sunday. Pollan was Fox's former girlfriend on NBC's
``Family Ties.''
   Fox's agent had announced the impending marriage on Friday but
wouldn't say where or when it would take place.
   Word leaked out that it would be at the West Mountain Inn,
sending about 40 photographers and reporters and six helicopters to
stake out the country inn.
   No details of the couple's honeymoon plans were given.
   Fox plays wise-guy Alex Keaton on ``Family Ties'' and starred in
the film ``Back to the Future,'' the top-grossing film of 1985.

   Princess Diana was in the audience, but singer
Michael Jackson went ahead anyway and sang his hit ``Dirty Diana,''
about a woman of loose morals.
   The 27-year-old princess smiled.
   Jackson had been expected to leave the song out of his concert
at Wembly Stadium because of the princess' presence Saturday night,
but an aide said the singer ``felt the fans would feel let down.''
   Diana, an avid pop music fan, and Prince Charles met backstage
with Jackson before the start of his third sell-out concert.
   ``I was so excited at meeting the royal couple,'' Jackson said.
``I am very, very happy that they have come to watch me perform. I
thought the princess was just wonderful.''
   Charles, who prefers classical music and opera, asked Jackson
how he learned to dance so well, and joked, ``Could you teach me to
dance?''
   Jackson, who will make $26.6 million from his 13-concert British
tour, donated $240,000 to a program set up by Charles to promote
employment of young people in inner cities and $166,000 to a
children's hospital.
   The singer also gave the royal couple four black jackets with
the word ``Bad'' _ the name of his top-selling album _ for
themselves and their sons, William, 6, and Harry, 3.

   Spanish tenor Placido Domingo's impassioned
singing drew such fervent cheers and wild clapping from a Chinese
audience that the star marveled, ``They sound as if they are
Latin.''
   ``It's extraordinary,'' Domingo said after singing selections
from Italian opera and Spanish popular music in his Chinese debut
at the Beijing Concert Hall. ``They are so enthusiastic.''
   After each song, Sunday's standing-room-only crowd erupted in a
roar of cheers and applause.
   Western opera was banned in China during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution on the grounds that it was bourgeois, but it has
returned to official favor in the past decade.
   Later in the week, Domingo, 47, will join with the Spanish
company Antologia de la Zarzuela in performing zarzuela, a
traditional Spanish mix of songs, dances and pageantry that
resembles opera.

   Paul McCartney says he wants to crown his 30-year
music career with a concert in the Soviet Union.
   But first the former Beatle is releasing an album only in the
Soviet Union called ``Back In The USSR,'' a collection of rock 'n'
roll classics from the '50s and '60s.
   ``I would love to play in Russia. It would be an interesting
gig,'' McCartney said Sunday. ``The first thing is to bring out the
record. Then I would like to go and see how the record is
received.''
   McCartney, 46, was frowned upon by the Soviet authorities during
the 1960s when Beatlemania swept the West. But Beatles records were
smuggled in and became popular among Soviet youngsters, who bought
them on the black market.
   ``The record is in the spirit of some of the friendship that
(Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev and (President) Reagan have got
going,'' said McCartney.
   ``It is just my gesture to the Russian people saying this peace
stuff looks like a good idea _ which is something I have believed
for years. Now we are actually seeing a little bit of it
happening.''

   Evangelist Billy Graham, back home after
trips to China and the Soviet Union, says he wrote a sermon on hope
after witnessing changes in those two countries.
   ``I think these two experiences we've had have given people some
hope,'' said Graham. ``People can't live without hope. I think of
all the people in the world who are starving, who live in war
zones, who are in prison, without any hope at all hardly _ and I
pray for them daily.
   Graham's three-week visit to China in April was his first to
that country, where his wife, Ruth, was born to missionary parents
and lived the first 17 years of her life.
   In June, the 69-year-old evangelist visited the Soviet Union for
the fourth time, helping to celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of
Christianity in that land.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Mark Ninth Year Facing Unprecedented Public Discontent</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of its ninth anniversary,
the leftist Sandinista government confronts unprecedented
discontent brought on by civil war, a shattered economy and
unfulfilled promises.
   The Sandinistas have put the brakes on recent moves to restore
basic freedoms and have cracked down on opponents with a vengeance.
The measures came just days before July 19 anniversary ceremonies
being held in the city of Juigalpa, 85 miles east of the capital.
   The government began easing restrictions on civil liberties to
comply with a regional peace plan signed in August by the
presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa
Rica.
   The plan, aimed at ending the war here and guerrilla wars in El
Salvador and Guatemala, called on signatory nations to grant
amnesties, negotiate cease-fires and undertake democratic reforms.
   To comply, the Sandinistas in January lifted a 6-year-old state
of emergency. Discontent started surfacing immediately.
   Opposition news media that had been shuttered or censored under
the emergency law reappeared and harshly attacked the government.
   Anti-Sandinista marches, which had been prohibited, began.
   With their more liberal policies, the Sandinistas achieved their
main goal: Congress voted down a request by President Reagan to
renew military aid to the Contra rebels fighting the Nicaraguan
government.
   But last week, the Sandinistas lashed out, indicating they had
had enough and wouldn't take any more.
   President Daniel Ortega and his cabinet also came under pressure
from party hard-liners opposed to the concessions, which included
the previously taboo step of opening negotiations with the Contras.
   In a series of quick moves, the government expelled U.S.
Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other American diplomats July
11, a day after police beat up opponents at an anti-government
demonstration.
   It jailed three dozen opposition figures, closed the Roman
Catholic Church's Radio Catolica and a private news program, and
ordered La Prensa, the only opposition newspaper, to suspend
publication for 15 days.
   The Sandinistas said the crackdown was a response to a
destabilization plan fostered by the U.S. Embassy and increasing
rebel attacks. But they offered little proof to back up their
accusations.
   Barricada, the newspaper of the Sandinista National Liberation
Front, published a list Saturday of dates on which Melton and the
other U.S. diplomats met with opposition groups. The headline read,
``Subversive Itinerary of Melton and the CIA.'' The State
Department called the visits normal.
   The Sandinistas have become increasingly frustrated by their
inability to end the Contra war, which is wrecking the economy and
fueling public discontent.
   In a move that took Washington off guard, Sandinista and rebel
leaders signed a cease-fire agreement March 23, but since then they
have made almost no headway in discussions to achieve a permanent
truce.
   The initial cease-fire, extended for 30-day periods by tacit
agreement on both sides, has been wearing thinner and thinner in
recent weeks, with the government recently reporting almost daily
rebel attacks.
   Opposition leaders said the crackdown was motivated by the
government's fear that the usually fragmented opposition was
unifying. Some claimed the crackdown showed the true face of the
Sandinistas.
   ``The mask came off and the people didn't see smiling faces.
They saw gas masks,'' said Virgilio Godoy, a former Sandinista
labor minister and now president of the Independent Liberal Party,
referring to the opposition protest July 10 which police broke up
with tear gas.
   When the Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolution that
ousted the rightist, pro-American dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza,
they promised a better life to a poverty-stricken people. They
enjoyed widespread support.
   ``We knew they were Marxists, but we thought they were different
Marxists who would deal realistically with the situation here,''
Godoy said. ``Many people felt deceived.''
   In 1981, the United States cut off all economic aid to
Nicaragua, claiming the Sandinistas were exporting revolution to
the rest of Central America and serving as a Communist beachhead in
the region. A U.S.-imposed trade embargo followed in 1985.
   The measures, together with U.S. support for the Contras and
Sandinista government mismanagement and corruption, almost scuttled
the economy. About half of Nicaragua's budget now goes to the fight
against the Contras.
   ``The economic situation, the hunger, the misery has gathered
momentum by all citizens, and we were tapping it,'' said another
opposition leader, Enrique Bolanos, head of the Superior Private
Enterprise Council.
   Meanwhile, supermarket shelves stand bare. The nation that once
exported rice and cotton has now turned to foreign donations for
basic food staples. Children rummage through trash piles seeking
scraps of food and the average worker doesn't earn enough to feed
his family.

<HEAD>Richards Promises `Very Direct' Keynote Address</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards on Sunday
tried out the podium she will use for Monday night's keynote
address to the Democratic National Convention, and promised a
``very direct'' message in her own homespun style.
   ``It's my speech. No one has seen it, and no one has given me
advice,'' she said. ``I want to lay it all out and put it on a
level that everyone will understand.''
   Richards said she will direct her address to her parents in
Waco, Texas, and to a family in the same area who recently wrote
her a letter about their economic problems and concerns about
America's national pride.
   The 20-minute speech will be simple and will be sprinkled with
``Texanisms,'' she said, adding, ``I wish I were William Jennings
Bryan or Mario Cuomo, but I'm not.''
   Richards, the highest woman elected official in Texas and a
likely candidate for governor in 1990, is a staunch feminist, and
said her selection to deliver the high-profile keynote address has
jangled her nerves.
   ``I think it's one of the most difficult things I carry with me
all the time,'' she said. ``I feel very strongly that I don't want
to fail. I always want to do well because then they'll think,
`Well, she can do it, maybe some other women can, too.''

<HEAD>Passenger Removed For Fighting Flight</HEAD>

   An Atlanta-bound jetliner made an
unscheduled stop Sunday to remove a passenger for hitting a flight
attendant over the correct change for a drink, an airline spokesman
said.
   The unidentified man was escorted off the Eastern Airlines plane
about 5:45 a.m., said security personnel at Huntsville
International Airport.
   No injuries to the male attendant were reported. The passenger
was not arrested.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the flight, traveling from
San Francisco with 183 passengers and a crew of eight, was delayed
more than three hours.
   Matell said the passenger ``argued with a male flight attendant,
apparently over the correct change on liquor money. Apparently it
was a rather heated argument. The word we have is that the
passenger hit the flight attendant.''
   The captain landed at the nearest airport to have the passenger
removed, said Lt. Steve Fields, an airport security officer.
   ``They had a small fisticuff on board,'' he said. ``All we did
was board the plane. The captain asked that we escort him off and
we did.''
   Fields said the investigation has been turned over to the FBI
because the incident took place in the air.

   Beneath the convention podium is a maze of rooms
where speakers try on clothes, get made up in plastic barber's
chairs, and rehearse their delivery as coaches warn: ``Don't get
carried away with the ad-libs.''
   ``We want to make sure people look easy and confident and not
uncomfortable,'' said Mike Sheehan, a Washington media consultant
and head coach. ``Many people will only be seeing this through the
eyes of a camera. I don't want (TV viewers) to be distracted.''
   The rehearsal room, identified by a green magic marker sign, is
one of several makeshift preparation areas beneath the podium.
There is a makeup room boasting two plastic barber's chairs and
some lights, a tastefully furnished conversation area draped off
from the cables and pre-stressed concrete beams, and a yellow and
white holding tent filled with a motley assortment of couches, end
tables and potted plants.
   Mirrors, telephones and portable toilets are also among the
amenities provided for those scheduled to speak. Texas Treasurer
Ann Richards, the keynote speaker, told reporters Sunday she was
going under the podium to try on jackets to see which color looked
best.
   The rehearsal room itself is equipped with a white plasterboard
replica of the podium, built to scale. A television screen provides
a simultaneous and sometimes unsettling view of speakers as they
rehearse. On either side of the podium is a TelePrompter mirror
reflecting the words of their speeches.
   Victor Raiser, the finance chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, had written the word ``turn'' into his speech at
periodic intervals as a reminder to shift his gaze from right to
left or vice versa.
   ``Once you get the hang of it, it's not so bad,'' Sheehan told
Raiser, trying to be encouraging. As Raiser launched into his brief
remarks for what seemed the millionth time, Sheehan paced, fidgeted
and adjusted the TelePrompTer.
   ``He's got it,'' he said suddenly to Dan Buck, assigned to
``punch up'' speeches and, sometimes, to cut them. ``How are we
doing?''
   ``3:40,'' Buck replied.
   ``We've got to pick up the pace,'' Sheehan said. He directed
Buck to do some trimming _ ``little surgicals'' _ and advised
Raiser, ``Don't get carried away with the ad-libs.''
   Sheehan, Buck and a battery of computer operators and
technicians started rehearsing people last Wednesday and won't be
finished until Thursday, the last day of the convention.
   ``We're not going to see the convention. We'll read about it in
Time magazine,'' said Buck, whose regular job is administrative
assistant to Rep. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado.
   ``By Thursday night I'll qualify for my voter registration card
at the Omni,'' said Sheehan. ``By the way, what's it like in the
outside world?''
   Replied Buck, ``Someone said it was snowing.''

<HEAD>Jackson Says Minority Platform Planks `Are Majority Opinions'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson said Sunday his minority platform
planks ``are majority positions'' that deserve to be debated and
decided by the full convention.
   The Democratic Platform Committee released the Jackson
campaign's minority report on 13 disputed issues Sunday, but said
compromises still were possible to avert floor fights Tuesday.
   Resolution of the lingering platform disputes must await a
settlement of the larger differences between Jackson and the
certain nominee, Michael Dukakis.
   Even then, Jackson made clear Sunday that he wants the Democrats
to debate his bedrock issues, especially his call for higher taxes
on the wealthy and corporations and a Pentagon freeze.
   ``The fact is minority planks will be debated and deliberated
upon and decided by the convention,'' Jackson said on CBS-TV's
``Face the Nation.''
   ``Our minority planks are majority positions. For example, most
Americans do not want any more taxes on the middle class and poor
people, but corporations and the wealthy must pay their share,''
Jackson said.
   The Dukakis campaign has said repeatedly it will not accept
Jackson's call for higher taxes, a five-year freeze on Pentagon
spending, a policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons, and support
of self-determination for the Palestinians.
   The minority report carries the disclaimer: ``These minority
positions are under discussion by the parties for possible
agreements on language that may lead to their inclusion in the
platform.''
   Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard, chairman of the platform
committee, said Saturday night, ``It's really in the hands of the
campaigns now.''
   Blanchard predicted in an interview that if Jackson does press
floor fights on all 13 issues, ``he might win one or two.''
   Some Jackson minority planks cover less thorny domestic issues
that lend themselves more readily to compromise. These included
Jackson's call for full funding of Head Start, pre-natal care and
the Women, Infants and Children program, doubling the education
budget, and creation of a national health program.
   Ron Brown, Jackson's convention manager, told reporters the
platform negotiations suspended Tuesday ``are not moving forward.''
   ``Until we have resolved the broader issues of the relationship
between Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis, more importantly the
relationship between Democratic Party and its crucial progressive
wing ... to pursue detailed discussions on the platform just don't
make sense,'' said Brown.
   Ann Lewis, a senior Jackson adviser, predicted that if the two
candidates come to terms, compromise language can be found for more
than half the disputed planks.
   At a dinner for the Platform Committee hosted by Rep. Bill
Richardson of New Mexico on Saturday night, both Jackson and
Dukakis delegates seemed pleased with their handiwork.
   Janice Thurmond, a Jackson delegate from Athens, Ga., said,
``Jackson's going to have to send a cue as to what he would like
his representatives and delegates to do about the platform, and
that hasn't come down yet.''
   Richardson, a co-chair of the platform committee, said, ``I
think there may be a skirmish on the defense and the revenue issue,
but once that chemistry returns between Dukakis and Jackson, then I
think everything will work out.''
   The platform writers were in a self-congratulatory mood.
   ``Well, platform people, we did it, didn't we? Didn't we do a
good job? It's probably the only platform in the history of America
that just says, `Good morning, America, we love ya,''' said Rep.
Louise Slaughter of Fairport, N.Y. ``We're right on the edge of
something absolutely wonderful.''
   William Schneider, an American Enterprise Institute analyst,
told the Democrats, ``Both the choice of Sen. (Lloyd) Bentsen and
the platform that you've written ... have a message to Reagan
Democrats. Those are Democrats who are not liberals. There are tens
of millions of them.''
   ``The message is, `Come home. There is no ideological test.
We're not going to ask you complicated questions. We want your
votes, your confidence. The only thing that we require is that you
want to change the direction of this country,''' said Schneider.
   The majority platform report, hammered out last month in
Mackinac Island, Mich., and Denver, runs fewer than 4,500 words _ a
tenth the size of the turgid 1984 platform and the Democrats'
shortest election blueprint since the 1930s.
   Without mentioning Ronald Reagan or George Bush, it commits the
party ``to reverse seven years of `voodoo economics,' `trickle
down' politics, fiscal irresponsibility, and economic violence
against poor and working people.'' It calls for ``more stable
defense budgets.''

<HEAD>Low Water Levels Increase Paralyzing Diving Accidents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rehabilitation specialists say that because
of the drought they are seeing more cases of young people diving
into shallow water, striking bottom and becoming paralyzed with
spinal injuries.
   ``These are usually young people who dive in a particular spot
for years with no problem. But they hit bottom this year,'' said
Dr. Dennis Maiman, chief of the spinal cord injury center at the
Veterans Administration Hospital in Milwaukee.
   Maiman said colleagues in California, Illinois and Minnesota
have noted similar increases in diving accidents.
   ``It's amazing how far-reaching the affects of the drought
are,'' Maiman said.
   Dave Kunelius, a Department of Natural Resources spokesman, said
low water levels are creating new ripples and currents that are
disguising river bottoms and obstacles.
   Dr. Donald Kelman, a Marshfield Clinic neurosurgeon, said diving
accidents often paralyze more severely than auto accidents, the
leading cause of such injuries.
   That is because they often injure vertebrae in the neck, causing
quadriplegia, or lack of movement or sensation from the neck down
rather than just the lower body.
   Dan Eckert, a rehabilitation counselor at University Hospital in
Madison who uses a wheelchair because of injuries suffered in a
lake diving accident at age 14, said there were three 15-year-olds
in rehabilitation there who suffered permanent injuries from diving
into shallow water.
   ``I'm hearing a lot of conversations from patients who say they
dove in a particular area 10,000 times and never had a problem, but
this spring they were hitting bottom,'' Eckert said.
   ``Most people who hurt their spine in a diving accident suffer
permanent injuries.''
   Eckert said the victims have ranged from 15 to 31 years old.
``People in that age group are more willing to take risks,'' he
said.

   PTL trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton has
granted an Australian businessman a five-day extension to make a
$50 million deposit on his $200 million offer to buy the TV
ministry's Heritage USA theme park.
   Benton originally gave Gavin Morehu until Friday to come up with
the earnest money, but PTL lawyer Bradford Leggett said Saturday
that after a meeting with Morehu, Benton extended the deadline
until Wednesday.
   Morehu, 52, is president and executive chairman of Morehu
International in Melbourne, Australia. He said he is involved in
banking, real estate, travel, construction and the import-export
business.
   Morehu is one of several contenders for PTL's assets, which are
being sold to pay creditors by order of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus
Reynolds.
   The religious broadcasting and entertainment empire filed for
bankruptcy after Jim Bakker resigned in 1987 in a sex and money
scandal.

   A man in a van fired up to 10 shots at three
transients bedding down under a bridge early Sunday, killing one
and wounding two, police said.
   ``The motive is unknown. The suspects, vehicle and weapon are
all outstanding,'' said Sgt. Bryce Houchin. ``There is no
indication that it was gang-related and no indication the suspects
and victims were known to each other.''
   The victims appeared to be getting ready to sleep under the
bridge, said Sgt. Leslie Lutz, who said as many as 10 shots were
fired.
   The van had pulled up alongside, said Houchin.
   The two wounded were in stable condition at Los Angeles
County-USC Medical Center, Houchin said.

<TEXT>
   A spill of more than 600,000
gallons of crude oil in the harbor has killed a small number crabs,
birds and other wildlife, officials said.
   ``The effect of the spill on the wildlife isn't that great
because it happened in the harbor,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Tom
Blinkinsop. ``There's not that many species of wildlife there.''
   A tanker carrying crude oil from Scotland rammed a refinery dock
Wednesday, opening a gash that allowed 15,350 barrels of oil, or
644,700 gallons, to gush into the ship channel. The spill closed
the port for 56 hours.
   Volunteers sounded a propane cannon and air horns Saturday to
scare birds away from the oily marsh near the dock.
   ``I've found quite a few blue crabs, fiddler crabs and one
hermit crab dead in the marshy area,'' Larry Gamble, environmental
contaminant specialist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said
Saturday.
   In addition, he said at least two birds and an opossum died as a
result of the spill.
   ``There have probably been more than two birds killed, because
when birds are injured, they're vulnerable to prey and so they hide
and we might not have found them yet,'' Gamble said.
   In the long term, ``there will be a reduction in food sources,
such as plankton, needed by such organisms as shrimp and crabs,''
he said.
   Chip Volz, district manager for the Texas Water Commission, said
no dead fish have been spotted. Fish were not affected because a
southeasterly wind carried the oil immediately to the north shore
of the harbor, he said.
   ``The fish had other places they could go in the harbor,'' he
said. ``Fish have a kind of avoidance factor in their movement.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Leads in Five-State Poll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael Dukakis led Vice President George
Bush in California, New York and Illinois and ran roughly even with
him in Texas and Florida in a Chicago Tribune poll published Sunday.
   Overall, the survey found Dukakis ahead by 11 points in the
nation's five most populous states. It was conducted July 5-9,
ending the week before Dukakis selected Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas
as his running mate.
   The Tribune interviewed 1,507 registered voters, about 300 in
each state. Dukakis led by 15 points in California, New York and
Illinois, a greater margin than the sampling error of plus or minus
six points per state.
   In Florida the poll put the race at 49 percent for Bush to 42
percent for Dukakis, essentially a dead heat because of the
sampling error. Nine percent of the Floridians polled were
undecided.
   In Texas it was 46-46-8 in the poll, though the Tribune said it
checked back with nearly 200 Texas respondents after Bentsen's
selection and found about one in six Bush supporters switching to
the Dukakis ticket.
   In the entire five-state sample, 50 percent of the respondents
backed Dukakis, 39 percent were for Bush and 11 percent were
undecided. The margin of error for that result was three points,
and the Dukakis lead was similar to that found in recent national
polls.
   The other state results were 51-36 in California, with 13
percent undecided; in New York, 52-37-11; and in Illinois, 51-36-13.

   Two anglers can add the story of the
hungry walleye to their collection of fish tales. They hooked the
11{-pounder at the same time.
   Marge Walker and Angie Crawford of Aberdeen were fishing in
separate boats on Lake Oahe earlier this month when the double-take
occurred. It took about a minute before they realized they were
trying to reel in the same fish.
   ``It was just the weirdest thing,'' Crawford said. ``We were
both pulling on it because the thing had both her hook and my hook.
I really thought I had something big. It could have knocked us both
out of the boat. Then someone from my boat told me that it looked
like we both had the same fish.''
   The boats, each carrying four people, were a few hundred feet
from each other, Walker said. ``We pulled up along side their boat
and everyone was just amazed that it had both spinners in its
mouth,'' she said.
   The women had never met before the incident. ``We all just sat
there and laughed and laughed and laughed,'' said Walker.
   ``He must have been hungry,'' added Crawford, who kept the prize
fish and later filleted it.

   You want irreverence? A mock state road
map has it.
   It spoofs everything from the Great Salt Lake to Gov. Norm
Bangerter and includes towns like LaVerkin (real) and Shirley (not
real).
   The ``Escape Utah'' map was designed for ``tourists without
rose-colored glasses'' by brothers Dale and Don Christensen, who
would just as soon keep their backgrounds a little vague.
   The $3.50 map lists the state's population as ``2,000,000 and
falling'' and has a non-primitive areas designation, but doesn't
list any.
   The state bird is the California gull, the state tree is the
Colorado blue spruce and according to the map, ``Narm Bangerter''
is the state dinosaur.
   ``Utah is one of those places with a big `Kick Me' sign on its
back,'' said Dale. ``Everyone in Utah takes themselves so
seriously. And everything out here is so sacrosanct. We decided to
pick on those things.''
   The brothers renamed the Great Salt Lake the Mediocre Salt Lake.
   ``We were laughing about all these people coming from all over
the world to see the Great Salt Lake, and it has to be one of the
dirtiest, smelliest places around,'' Don said. ``Calling it great
breaks all of the truth-in-advertising laws.''

<HEAD>Two Unions Call Off Theatened Strike By Air Controllers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of three unions representing French air traffic
controllers on Sunday called off plans for a one-day strike, but
airlines said it would be too late to restore most canceled flights.
   French controllers called the strike for Monday to protest
conditions stemming from increased air traffic over Western Europe.
They say they are overworked and suffering from stress.
   Two unions representing about 70 percent of the air controllers
_ the National Union of Air Traffic Controllers and another known
as the CFDT _ said they were canceling the strike in response to a
letter Sunday from Transport Minister Michel Delebarre.
   Delebarre promised a series of meetings to find solutions to the
problems.
   But the Union of Civil Aviation Unions, affiliated with the
Communist-led General Federation of Labor, said the 16 percent of
controllers it represents would stay off the job.
   The union said Delabarre's letter was ``a gesture of good will''
but offered no new proposals.
   Officials of Air France and Air Inter, the state-owned
international and domestic airlines, said there was no time to
reschedule previously canceled flights.
   ``We've got the planes, but we have to put together the crews,''
said Air France spokesman Jean-Claude Couturier. ``There's also no
way to alert the passengers.''
   He said the airline did not expect to be able to restore very
many of the canceled flights.
   Earlier, Air France dropped 90 of its 138 flights scheduled to
leave Paris. Air Inter said it would cancel all but 80 of its 347
flights.
   Foreign airlines flying to and from France also canceled most of
their flights or diverted them to cities in Belgium, Switzerland or
Italy.
   The three unions have different demands, which include hiring
more controllers.

   Four East German border guards seized a man who

West Berlin police official said Sunday.
   Several tourists on the Western side of the border witnessed the

   Photographs published by the newspaper showed two East German
guards pinning the man to the ground.
   Witnesses told the newspaper that the man, between 30 and 40
years old, tried to free himself and cried for help as he was held
about 20 yards away from the border. He then was taken away,
witnesses said.
   The West Berlin police official, who spoke on condition of

   Fire engulfed a chemical storage tank in
northern Italy Sunday, producing a cloud of acrid black smoke that
prompted thousands of people to flee in panic, police said.
   No serious injuries were reported and authorities said the smoke
was not toxic.
   About 20 people complaining of stomach pains and burning in
their eyes and throats were examined at the hospital in Massa,
about 170 miles north of Rome on the Tyrrhenian coast.
   Police said an explosion of unknown origin sparked the fire in
the 13,000-gallon tank of cyclohexane, a liquid hydrocarbon.
   Black smoke filled the sky after the 6:30 a.m. blast and
thousands of people rushed to their cars and fled, causing huge
traffic jams, police said.
   Firefighters and police said the blaze was quickly brought under
control.
   The company is owned by Farmoplant, a subsidiary of the giant
Montedison chemical firm, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   In recent years there have been several toxic leaks at the
plant, and residents of Massa demanded its closure in a referendum
in October.

   A Sioux Indian who accurately predicted rain
last month fulfilled another promise with a rain prayer ceremony
that was followed about 90 minutes later with a shower that at
least momentarily broke the drought.
   Leonard Crow Dog smoked a ceremonial pipe and spread spring
water in all four directions and toward the ground and sky in the
half-hour ceremony at dusk Saturday. About 500 people attended.
   ``He's doing this to bring rain for now and for future
generations and to bring snow for this winter, and to keep peace
with God and unite the people,'' said Cliff Doebel, a florist who
brought Crow Dog to Clyde in June.
   About an hour and a half after the ceremony, a line of
thunderstorms passing through northern Ohio produced rain in Clyde,
Doebel said.
   ``It seems a little ironic, doesn't it?'' he said.
   Crow Dog performed a rain dance June 19, and the village
received a quarter-inch of rain later in the week just as he
predicted.
   Doebel said the visitor from South Dakota made no predictions
about when the rain would come as a result of his rain prayer.
   ``I had a lot of people seek me out and thank me for bringing
him in,'' Doebel said. ``The people that are here tonight are
holding on to hope that some good will come from this and the rains
will come.''

   SAN`A, North Yemen (AP) _ President Ali Abdullah Saleh resigned
Sunday before a newly elected parliament but was re-elected within
hours, the official news agency said.
   The Saba news agency said the 159-member Majlis Al-Shura, or
consulative assembly, chose Saleh for a new five-year term. The
vote was 152 in favor, with two abstaining and five absent, it said.
   Saleh, 46, has governed the Red Sea country at the southern tip
of the Arabian Peninsula since July 1978.
   The news agency said he resigned during a speech in which he
told the new legislature to choose ``whoever they see capable,
efficient and sincere ... in shouldering the responsibility of
leading the country.''
   The assembly is the first elected parliament in the history of
North Yemen, which became a republic in 1962. In elections July 5,
128 members were elected, and Saleh later appointed 31 more members.
   Saleh's term was to expire in May, but the constituent assembly
overseeing the elections decided to extend it until August.

   Polish radio will broadcast programs by
U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe in response to increased public
interest in the Western radio station, the state-run news agency
PAP said Sunday.
   The state-run radio station will air programs and discussions
that were recorded this year at the Munich-based Radio Free Europe,
the agency said.
   The purpose of the broadcasts is ``to enable Polish listeners to
form their own opinion on the character of Radio Free Europe and
the kind of its transmissions,'' the report said.
   Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban and the official Polish
press have accused Radio Free Europe of inaccuracies and of
presenting a distorted view of Poland.
   In announcing the broadcasts, PAP said the public was interested
in ``the Western radio station's behind-the-stage subversive
activities.''
   Jamming of Polish-language broadcasts of Radio Free Europe,
Voice of America and the BBC ended January 1. The action was
accompanied by an increased Polish media campaign against the
stations, particularly Radio Free Europe, which currently broadcast
uncensored news and commentary to Poland.

   Premier Turgut Ozal said Sunday that his
Motherland Party will try to amend the constitution to hold
nationwide local elections in October, five months ahead of
schedule.
   Ozal told a news conference that the decision to seek the
amendment was made at the end of a two-day meeting of his party's
Chairmanship Council which, in addition to himself, is made up of
eight top party officials.
   The support of at least 300 deputies in the 450-seat Parliament
is needed to pass the measure authorizing the early local elections.
   The Motherland Party has 290 seats in Parliament.
   The opposition True Path Party of former Premier Suleyman
Demirel, which has 59 deputies, has also repeatedly expressed
support for early local elections.
   Ozal mentioned Oct. 16 and Oct. 23 as possible dates for the
elections if the amendment is approved.
   The local elections will be a crucial test for Ozal's party,
whose popularity in recent months has slipped to about 25 percent,
down from the 36 percent the party enjoyed in last year's general
elections, according to public opinion polls.

   Thousands of people thinking they ought

Fonda-Robert DeNiro movie ``Stanley and Iris.''
   The choice of Waterbury for some scenes in the MGM movie sparked
protests earlier this year from veterans upset about by Miss
Fonda's visit to Hanoi in 1972 during the Vietnam War.
   But the veterans' sentiments did not daunt an estimated 3,000
would-be actors and actresses from turning out to vie for the 500
roles for extras, and police reported no problems at Saturday's
casting call.
   ``Instead of playing golf or going to a movie, we thought we'd
do this,'' said lawyer Mark Wawer of Waterbury, one of those in
line.
   More than 50 people were in line by 6:30 a.m., 2{ hours before
auditions were to begin.
   Scenes are to be filmed in the city in late July or early August
for the story of a factory worker fired when his employer learns he
cannot read. The woman he works with teaches him to read, and the

   A man was arrested and charged with murdering
his pregnant ex-girlfriend minutes after she desperately called a
police emergency operator for help and said, ``He's going to kill
me,'' authorities said.
   William Elliott, 26, was arrested Saturday on charges of murder
and criminal possession of a weapon in the June 21 shooting of
Carol Kudelycz, said police spokesman Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   Elliott was picked up without incident in Queens, where he had
taken refuge with relatives, O'Donnell said.
   Two months before the shooting, Elliott had doused Miss Kudelycz
with gasoline and tried to set her afire, police said. Elliott was
arrested in that incident and jailed, but Miss Kudelycz dropped the
charges. Prosecutors continued pressing the case, but Elliott was
freed on bail just three weeks before the alleged murder.
   Miss Kudelycz, 25, of Queens, was killed as she called police on
the 911 line for the second time in 22 minutes. A police dispatcher
was suspended for not acting quickly enough on the first call.
   As her attacker pounded on the door of her apartment, Miss
Kudelycz called 911 and said, ``He's going to kill me. He's crazy.''
   Minutes later, Elliott allegedly barged into the apartment and
shot Miss Kudelycz while she was giving a 911 operator her address
during her second call. Miss Kudelycz was shot in front of her
5-year-old son, a teen-age cousin and a friend.
   Police officers arrived at the apartment 15 minutes after the
shooting, and 38 minutes after Miss Kudelycz's first 911 call.
   Dispatcher Cloria Washington was suspended for taking almost 20
minutes to notify a patrol car about the first call, a procedure
that normally takes emergency dispatchers 3.5 minutes.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators chanting ``Free
Nelson Mandela!'' thronged Hyde Park on Sunday to mark the 70th
birthday of the jailed South African leader. It was one of the
biggest anti-apartheid rallies ever in London.
   Against a backdrop of flags of the African National Congress,
South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu led the rally in chants that
echoed across central London.
   ``In 25 years in jail, he (Mandela) has not spoken to the
public, yet many people not born then have been inspired by him,''
declared Tutu.
   ``This man is head and shoulders above any contemporary leader
in South Africa,'' Tutu said. ``Any sensible government would
realize that Nelson Mandela is absolutely essential for peace and
stability in southern Africa.''
   Mandela turns 70 on Monday. He was jailed in 1962 for leaving
South Africa illegally and inciting unrest. While serving a
five-year sentence, he was given a life term in 1964 for sabotage
and plotting the overthrow of the government.
   South Africa's white-led government banned all major birthday
celebrations for Mandela, whose ANC guerrilla movement is outlawed
there.
   Organizers arranged a last-minute concert Sunday at the
University of Cape Town, but police stopped it about two hours
after it began. The audience of 500 left peacefully.
   Dozens of foreign governments called for Mandela's release in
recent days.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Mandela, ``It distresses
one to realize that you mark the birthday in a prison dungeon into
which you were thrown by the racists more than a quarter of a
century ago.''
   ``Soviet people firmly demand your release, Comrade Mandela, and
the release of all political prisoners in the Republic of South
Africa,'' Gorbachev said in a telegram Sunday, which was published
by the official Tass news agency. ``I give you a strong handshake.''
   In Italy, thousands jammed piazzas for a Saturday night concert
in Bologna and another one Sunday in Rome. Dutch and Swedish
anti-apartheid movements scheduled events for Monday.
   In central London, traffic was snarled as the demonstrators,
headed by 25 activists who had marched 500 miles from Glasgow,
Scotland, poured into Hyde Park under rainy skies.
   The organizers, Britain's Anti-Apartheid Movement, estimated the
crowd at 250,000 people, but police put the figure at only 30,000.
Scotland Yard reported three arrests on minor offenses.
   The mostly young, white crowd swayed as a South African band
belted out African nationalist themes from the podium, which was
ringed with red and black tribal warrior shields.
   They roared with approval as the face of Winnie Mandela, the
jailed leader's wife, flashed on a giant video screen. In a message
taped in South Africa, she said her husband's birthday ``relates to
a symbol of resistance in this country.''
   ``We are very moved, very touched, by this gesture,'' she said,
expressing thanks ``to the entire international community'' for
applying pressure for her husband's release.
   Security forces, some in armored vehicles, patrolled South
Africa's major black townships Sunday, although there were no
reports of violence. Police also set up several roadblocks,
including one outside Cape Town's Pollsmoor Prison where Mandela is
held.
   Six other purple-robed bishops, in Britain for the Lambeth
Conference of Anglican bishops held every 10 years, joined Tutu on
the podium.
   They sat with labor union activists, opposition Labor Party
members of Parliament, Commonwealth Secretary General Sir Shridath
Ramphal and Sir Richard Attenborough, whose film on South Africa,
``Cry Freedom,'' has attracted huge audiences.
   The crowd cheered as speakers denounced Western leaders,
particularly British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for refusing
to impose tough economic sanctions against South Africa.
   Mandela has refused an offer of release by the South African
government on the condition he renounces violence, saying that the
real prepetrators of violence are South African authorities.
   South African diplomat Justus de Goede, the second-ranking
official at the London Embassy, said in a radio interview the ANC
was committed to the violent overthrow of the government, and noted
that bomb and grenade attacks by ANC guerrillas were increasing.
   ``I think it is asking a great deal of any government to
knowingly release the leader of an organization which has this
political manifesto into society without some sort of guarantee,''
de Goede said.
   The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting South Africa's
government and its system of apartheid, under which the country's
26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate schools and
districts.
   In addition to Gorbachev, West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahahir Mohamad
and Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen all called Sunday
for Mandela's release.

   This is what Atlanta has become:
   Suspicious:
   Before Jesse Jackson arrived at the Marriott Marquis Hotel,
grown men in dark suits pushed ball point pens into the soil of
hundreds of planters hanging off the balconies on each of 46
floors. This unusual method of aerating the soil was a check for
explosives.
   Helpful:
   The Iowa delegation, in a superbly crafted handbook, advises
conventioneers to wear light clothing _ good advice in 90 plus
temperatures _ and to wear comfortable shoes for considerable
walking on unforgiving concrete floors. The best advice of all,
however, is: ``Find the Rest Rooms. This will save time.''
   Hospitable:
   A sign at The Tattletale, a strip joint, reads: ``Welcome
delegates.'' But not all. One delegate to the Democratic National
Convention is 18 years old, too young for such educational
enterprises. Besides, Kristin Farr of Redmond, Wash., possibly
prefers other entertainments.
   A collector's paradise:
   One of the most active subcultures at the convention is the
button collector. He prowls the hard concrete of the Georgia World
Congress Center, where the news media do their work in
blue-curtained enclaves, sniffing out new sources the way a pig
goes for truffles. ``You got any buttons?'' has replaced ``When's
Jesse coming?'' as a topic. At The New York Times, more than a day
before the first sound of the gavel at the convention, a
hand-lettered sign frostily declared ``No More Buttons!''
   A protest site:
   A pro-marijuana group of hippies clad in tie-dyed garments is
staging the ``Alternative Convention '88'' just three blocks from
The Omni. Saturday was human rights day for the Alternatives.
Sunday was Animal Rights Day, and Monday will be particularly busy
as No Nukes, Native American Rights and Environmental Day complete
with music from the Plutonium Players.
   On Saturday, urine testing was a major point of contention for
the Alternative platform, and marijuana was touted as both a ``safe
drug'' and, in a hemp form, as a cheap source of paper products.
   Some 75 groupies heard philosopher and former drug guru Timothy
Leary say that at the Democratic convention, ``Ain't going to be no
one thinking for themselves.'' That did not keep him from showing
up at a convention party _ perhaps to check out the thinking.
   A walk down memory lane:
   The World Congress Center, home for 3,500 news people, is so big
that the fire department insisted on partitioning it with street
names. There is John F. Kennedy Boulevard, Lyndon B. Johnson
Avenue, Harry S. Truman Road and Latimore Lane. Latimore, a party
staff member, got in there, it is said, because they ran out of
Democratic presidential names. Non-winning nominees like George B.
McClellan, Horatio Seymour, Horace Greeley and Alton S. Parker
apparently never were considered.
   Demopolitically Aware:
   Gorin's ice cream put its analysis of the political situation
into its product, creating ``Dukakis Delight'' a mixture of
strawberry and chocolate _ those being the favorites of the
Massachusetts governor and his wife.
   Cynics suggested the Dukakis treat would typically be bland and
boring. There was no sign of Jesse Jackson Rainbow sherbet.
   Almost, but not quite ready:
   It was ever thus, but come opening day, Monday, for better or
worse, the 40th Democratic National Convention, the first in the
South since 1972, will open in a splash of rose, sky-blue and pink.
   Visitors are told those podium colors truly are patriotic, that
they will be the traditional red, white and blue to the folks
watching on TV. The delegate seats, however, are covered with the
real red, white and blue.
   The Omni, usually home to the Atlanta Hawks, may well be the
smallest hall for a Democratic political convention in modern
times. The scoreboard high overhead betrays its heritage, with ads
for Winston cigarettes, Coca-Cola _ the hometown product _ and
Delta Air Lines, which also makes its home here.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Economy, Family Issues Are Top Concerns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters ranked the economy their top concern _
followed by family issues and defense _ in a Gallup poll sponsored
by the nation's largest organization of retirees.
   Horace B. Deets, the executive director of the American
Association of Retired Persons, said Sunday the survey of 1,500
voters indicated ``family issues are especially important to
marginal or swing voters, including Democrats who voted for Reagan
in 1984.''
   The Gallup organization, in a telephone survey conducted June
14-19, asked voters to rate issues they regarded as ``one of the
most important factors determining your vote.''
   Almost two-thirds, 65 percent, picked economic issues. Forty-six
percent cited family issues, compared with 44 percent who said
defense and 36 percent foreign policy.
   Deets said nearly 500 of the 4,162 delegates to the Democratic
National Convention belong to the AARP, which boasts a membership
of 28 million people 50 and older.
   The organization held a briefing Sunday for several dozen
delegates on three of its main concerns: long-term care,
safeguarding Social Security and improving private pensions, and
health care costs.
   An AARP-Gallup analysis of the survey said, ``Older respondents
are more concerned about health care costs, retirement income and
the costs of long-term care. Younger respondents are more concerned
about employment opportunities, college costs, the costs of buying
a house and child care.''

   Police charged a black man with murdering
a black woman that investigators thought was possibly racially
motivated because the letters ``KKK'' were carved on her leg.
   Detective Mike Turck said Sunday that any racial motive in the
death of Anna Kithcart, 19, had been ruled out and that a drug link
was suspected.
   Police arrested Jeffrey Allen Dawson, 29, late Saturday. He
appeared before a City Court judge Sunday, but his arraignment was
postponed until Monday after he asked for an attorney. No bond was
set and he remained in jail.
   ``There is evidence of drug use and abuse throughout this
case,'' Turck said. ``Both persons have been known to use drugs in
the past.''
   Police said Dawson and the victim were acquaintances. They were
both seen at a tavern last Monday night, and Miss Kithcart's body
was found the next day a few blocks away. The carving of Klan
initials on her leg was revealed by police last Thursday.
   Also charged in the case was Joseph Kiernan, 41, who police
described as a transient and former psychiatric patient. Kiernan,
who is white, was charged with sexually abusing the victim's corpse
and was jailed pending a psychological examination.
   Kiernan told a radio station in an interview last week that he
thought Miss Kithcart's body was a life-sized pornographic doll,
and that he called police when he saw a head wound.
   Police Chief James Riggens said investigators suspect the
letters may have been carved on the victim after she was killed.
   Police obtained a handwriting sample from Kiernan and were
awaiting test results to determine whether his handwriting matches
the writing style of the person who scratched ``KKK'' on Kithcart's
body, Assistant District Attorney John Prizzia said.
   Miss Kithcart's father told the Kingston Daily Freeman earlier
in the week that his daughter had fallen victim to drugs. ``I'm
almost positive it was a drug rub,'' Eugene Kithcart said.
   Preliminary autopsy results indicated Miss Kithcart was
strangled and struck on the head with a blunt instrument, police
said.
   Kingston is located about 25 miles north of Wappingers Falls, on
the opposite shore of Hudson River. Last November, 16-year-old
Tawana Brawley, of Wappingers Falls, was found with the letters
``KKK'' and racial epithets scrawled in a charcoal-like substance
on her skin after being missing for four days.
   She later said she had been abducted and raped by a group of
white men, but she and her family have refused to cooperate with a
state investigation.

<HEAD>Kirk: Convention Like a TV Miniseries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk, in a
convention-eve pep talk, told state delegation leaders Sunday to
think of the convention as a four-day television miniseries with
the delegates as the live audience.
   ``We have worked together for four years for this week,'' he
said. ``Remember ... you never get a second chance to make a first
impression.''
   He asked the delegates to stay in their seats. ``For the people
who came to party, there is plenty of opportunity next door,'' Kirk
said.
   Next door to the Omni Coliseum, where the convention opens
Monday, is a huge hall whose rooms have been reserved for parties
and other events.
   The delegation leaders were told that each evening's convention
session should be regarded as two segments, the important one being
the two hours when ABC, CBS and NBC are putting it on the air.
   ``Between 9 and 11,'' the instruction went, ``we are going to
have to be jam up and jelly tight to get everything we want in
there.''

   Police determined to avoid ``blood in the
streets'' canceled a march and rally by white supremacists Sunday
after helmeted officers used riot shields to shove aside hundreds
of anti-racist demonstrators.
   The leader of the white supremacist group, the Nationalist
Movement, later was taken into protective custody by police.
   There was frequent shoving between police and
counterdemonstrators but no reports of violence or injuries outside
the Georgia state Capitol, where the opposing groups gathered. The
spot is a half-mile from the Omni, where the Democratic National
Convention opens Monday.
   The entire Capitol was roped off as anti-racist contingents were
confined to either end of Washington Avenue, separated by police in
riot gear. As temperatures rose above 90, the protesters,
representing a variety of groups, chanted such slogans as ``No KKK,
no Fascist USA.''
   An American flag and a Confederate flag were burned in the
street as hundreds of reporters looked on. Bare-chested, shaggy
youths danced wildly and chanted as others beat drums and played
flutes.
   Police with helmets and riot shields pushed the crowd back at
one point. Firecrackers popped and mounted police moved in, then
left the area.
   ``This was a hostile, angry, nasty crowd and that's why we
canceled the march,'' said Public Safety Commissioner George Napper.
   ``It was a tough call because this is America,'' he said, but he
said he was determined to avoid ``blood in the streets of Atlanta.''
   After the cancellation, about 250 counterdemonstrators marched
from the Capitol to the official protest zone near the convention
center, chanting ``We just took the Klan's march.''
   Gov. Joe Frank Harris said he did not think the cancellation
amounted to a failure of security.
   ``I think that shows the system worked,'' he said. ``We're here
to provide security for the people and also to protect them and to
see that everybody has a good time and nobody gets hurt.''
   Convention security spokeswoman Jackie Barrett said Richard
Barrett, chief organizer of the Nationalist Movement march and no
relation, was taken into protective custody when he entered the
protest zone.
   About 30 of his backers carrying Confederate battle flags tried
to march to the protest zone despite the cancellation. The
anti-racist protesters surrounded them but police separated the two
groups again before there was any violence. The white supremacist
marchers were then taken back to their cars by police bus, and
there were no arrests, police said.
   ``If our Lord Jesus can ride into Jerusalem on the back of a
donkey, Richard Barrett can drive down Marietta Street in his
Chevrolet pickup truck,'' protested Barrett before he was taken
into custody.
   ``This is a shameful act on the part of the city,'' said Gene
Guerrero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union
of Georgia, regarding the cancellation. The ACLU has gone to court
several times on behalf of white supremacists' free speech rights.
   ``The presence of 200 counterdemonstrators is no reason to
cancel the United States Constitution,'' he said. ``That's the same
argument (they) used to cancel civil rights demonstrations in the
1960s.''
   ``They (white supremacists) wanted to have a rally on this very
spot,'' said Andre Powell of Baltimore, a member of the All
Peoples' Congress, one of the anti-racist groups. ``And look who's
here. We feel it's very important that when the Klan comes out,
they must always know that people won't idly sit by.''
   Barrett said in a telephone interview that he was held at the
Fulton County Jail for four hours in what he called ``police
oppression.''
   ``Freedom isn't free, and sometimes you've got to pay the
price,'' said Barrett, who said his pickup truck was vandalized
while he was in jail. ``I paid mine today. But like Douglas
MacArthur, I shall return.''
   Barrett said he planned to hold a news conference Monday morning
in the Forsyth County seat of Cumming, site of a huge civil rights
protest in January 1987, to discuss the incidents Sunday.
   Sunday marked the first day of scheduled protests in the
two-acre parking lot across the street from the convention where
city authorities are providing a stage and sound equipment for
groups to demonstrate at two-hour intervals.
   About 20 people _ not including reporters _ showed up in
broiling heat as the Coalition to Support Cuban Detainees began the
protests. The Mad Housers, a homeless relief group based in
Atlanta, built a small red, white and blue hut as an example of the
structures they put up for homeless people in the city.
   About 120 people carrying signs and chanting slogans marched
from Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium to the protest zone to
demonstrate against Ethiopian control of the Eritrean region of
north Africa.
   In other demonstrations:
   _LEGAL, a gay rights group, pressed for more efforts to cure
AIDS and for an end to discrimination against homosexuals. Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., a sponsor of major AIDS funding
legislation, told a crowd of about 2,000 people, ``We must not be
overly cautious in battling this killer'' and urged more
experimentation with different possible cures for AIDS.
   Ray Hill of Houston, Tex., a gay rights activist for 26 years,
said the Democratic Party ``is not as sensitive to the brothers and
sisters who have died of AIDS as you and I have become.''
   Many demonstrators wore pink triangles similar to those Adolph
Hitler forced homosexuals to wear in Nazi Germany.
   _Radio personality Casey Kasem was among the speakers for
Compassion Campaign '88, an animal rights group. The organization
is promoting legislation to outlaw steel-jawed leg traps, use of
``veal cages'' that hold calves immobile to keep their flesh
tender, and some chemical tests on animals.
   ``We can begin to start thinking about stopping wars when we
stop killing the creatures we share the earth with, the animals,''
said Kasem, who hosts a nationally syndicated Top 40 radio program.
   _A planned march and rally by the Association of Community
Organizations For Reform Now was canceled because the heat was too
intense for some for the group's elderly members.

6 and 20. Picks up 20th graf pvs ... Advocates for.</NOTE>

   Michael Dukakis, vowing to ``launch a winning
campaign'' for the White House, arrived in Atlanta on Sunday to
claim the Democratic nomination for president. He said he wanted to
meet with rival Jesse Jackson in a bid to assure convention-week
unity.
   ``We're working hard to make sure we have a good convention, a
strong and united party,'' the Massachusetts governor said after he
and ticketmate Lloyd Bentsen touched down in their chartered
Presidential Airways jet.
   Jackson spent his day moving triumphantly around town, holding
the convention-city spotlight even if he was far short of the
delegates needed to dislodge Dukakis' hold on the nomination.
``This is not a coronation,'' he said, ``this is a convention.''
   The runner-up in the primary season said it was ``too much to
expect'' a party gathering without debate. ``That is in the highest
and best traditions of the Democratic Party,'' he told CBS,
although he predicted there would be unity by the end of the week.
   Bentsen said he thought the Democrats were showing more unity
than in any time in the past 20 years, adding, ``The tide is really
moving with us.''
   Dukakis and Jackson talked by phone during the day, and the
Massachusetts governor said, ``We'll probably be talking a little
later this evening'' by phone. He added, ``I'm sure we're going to
be meeting during the course of the convention.''
   Advisers to the two men met for more than an hour in a downtown
hotel. Jackson press secretary Delmarie Cobb said she expected a
Monday morning meeting.
   The Dukakis camp also worked to create the impression of a
campaign looking toward the fall election. Senior aide Jack
Corrigan announced that 35 state field directors met during the
day. He said Jackson advisers would be among those yet to be named.
   Dukakis _ during farewell remarks from Boston _ seemed to
stiffen in the face of Jackson's continuing demands.
   ``You can't have two quarterbacks,'' he said in a blunt
assessment of Jackson's call for ``shared responsibility.'' He
added, ``Every team has to have a quarterback; that's the nominee.''
   He added, ``No Democratic convention would be a Democratic
convention without a little controversy.''
   As for Jackson, Dukakis told a Statehouse news conference in
Boston, ``We know each other, we like each other, we respect each
other.''
   Ohio Democrats passed the word that Sen. John Glenn would
introduce Bentsen to the convention on Thursday, a gesture of unity
by a man passed over when Dukakis picked his running mate.
   Bentsen's nomination was assured, but Jackson and his aides held
out the possibility of a challenge just the same.
   Some of Jackson's backers cautioned against pressing too hard.
``There is a danger in taking your followers to the brink,'' said
Birmingham, Ala., Mayor Richard Arrington, a Jackson delegate.
   Countered Rep. Tommy Robinson of Arkansas, Dukakis ``doesn't
know how to communicate with Southern blacks. All the blacks he
talks to are Harvard grads. He needs to sit down with Jesse.''
   Bentsen professed optimism that a convention collision with
Jackson could be avoided. ``I think the process is under way and
we're certainly reaching out to Rev. Jackson,'' he said.
   Thousands of delegates flooded into heat-drenched Atlanta in
plenty of time to sample the tourist attractions and restaurants
before settling down to the business of anointing Dukakis as their
man to lead the fall campaign against Republican George Bush.
   Jim Smith from New Jersey may have spoken for many when he said,
``I've checked in and I'm headed for the bar.''
   At the Georgia state Capitol, police equipped with riot shields
intervened to prevent violence between white supremacists and
counter-demonstrators. Authorities revoked a permit held by the
supremacists because they said they couldn't guarantee their safety.
   ``It was a tough call because this is America,'' said Public
Safety Commissioner George Napper after taking supremacist leader
Richard Barrett into protective custody. He said he was determined
to prevent ``blood in the streets of Atlanta.'' Barrett called it
``police oppression.''
   Advocates for Cuban detainees and a homeless relief group called
the ``Mad Housers'' demonstrated outside the hall in a parking lot
set aside by city authorities for protests.
   The latest polling information was good for the Democrats. A
survey by the Chicago Tribune indicated that the Dukakis-Bentsen
ticket led Bush in California, New York and Illinois _ accounting
for 107 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.
The survey showed the Democrats running even or slightly ahead in
Bentsen's home state and behind in Florida.
   ``This is a week we've been looking forward to for a long, long
time,'' Dukakis said at a low-key airport welcome in Atlanta. ``We
hope and expect to launch a winning campaign.''
   Just before leaving Boston, Dukakis told reporters, ``I'm
looking forward to the week.'' He said, ``I'm on my way to a
convention where, if everything goes well, I'm going to be the
Democratic presidential nominee. That's never happened to me
before.''
   The Omni Hall was ready to receive the assemblage, a basketball
arena transformed into a made-for-television facility. ``When we
made the selection (of the Omni) we loooked at this hall as a
television studio,'' said party chairman Paul Kirk.
   A parade of convention speakers took turns practicing their
remarks party in a rehearsal room beneath the podium. Keynote
speaker Ann Richards said she was there to decide which color
jacket would look best on television.
   Party elders made the rounds of the morning talk shows,
predicting the convention would end in unity.
   Former President Jimmy Carter said Jackson would inflict
political damage on himself it he demanded ``selfish things for
himself that are divisive in nature...He's not going to make that
kind of mistake.'' Carter spoke on ABC's ``This Week With David
Brinkley.''
   ``In my judgment, Jesse Jackson will deliver one of the great
unity speeches ever delivered at a Democratic convention,'' agreed
Robert Strauss, a former party chairman.
   Former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya, who has represented Jackson
in the peace-making talks, said he is optimistic the differences
can be worked out before the opening gavel falls on Monday.
   The man Republicans will name to run against Dukakis, Vice
President George Bush, was fishing in Wyoming with Treasury
Secretary Jim Baker. He'll be back campaigning on Wednesday, the
day Democrats make it official and bestow their nomination on
Dukakis.
   In his morning talk show appearance, Jackson said he was sure
the Democrats would wind up with a unified convention _ eventually.
   ``At this point there is no defined place for the progressive
wing in the campaign,'' he said. ``Our minority planks are majority
positions,'' he said.
   ``...It's too much to expect that we not debate and deliberate
and arrive at decisions and arrive at a mandate to govern. That is
in the highest and best traditions of the Democratic Party,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Reports Kinnock Held At Gunpoint In Zimbabwe Mix-Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soldiers detained British Labor Party
leader Neil Kinnock at gunpoint Sunday after the Zimbabwe air force
plane in which he was traveling landed at a military airstrip 20
miles from the official welcoming party.
   Kinnock's wife Glenys, three Labor Party officials and a dozen
accompanying journalists also were detained at the remote airstrip
near Mutare, Zimbabwe, on the border with Mozambique.
   The plane bringing Kinnock's party from Mozambique landed at the
airstrip while Zimbabwe government officials and British High
Commissioner Ramsay Melhuish were at Mutare's civilian airport,
Grand Reef, about 20 miles away.
   At the military strip, five soldiers armed with automatic rifles
escorted Kinnock and his entourage in a hut and detained them for
an hour until Melhuish and Zimbabwean officials arrived.
   Soldiers trained AK-47 weapons on Kinnock's group while it was
waiting.
   Kinnock told a corporal in camouflage fatigues that he would
lodge an official protest.
   Kinnock's party and British High Commission officials refused
further comment.
   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said in London ``it all
appears to have been a hiccup. Mr. Kinnock and the party are now
continuing with their programs.''
   After the incident, Kinnock and the British officials drove to
Nyanga, a mountain resort 175 miles northeast of the capital
Harare. The labor leader was scheduled to visit a military camp
near Nyanga on Monday, where British soldiers are training
Zimbabwean and Mozambiquan troops.
   Kinnock is also expected to meet with Zinmbabwean President
Robert Mugabe later Monday before returning to Britain at the end
of a ten-day, four-nation southern African tour.
   Soldiers routinely guard civilian and military airstrips in
Zimbabwe. Security has been increased since the June 30 theft of a
Zimbabwe air force helicopter for an abortive attempt to rescue
alleged South African agents from jail.
   Kinnock's Labor Party is the main opposition party in Britain's
House of Commons. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
Party has held power since 1979.
   On his visit to Botswana, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe,
Kinnock said Mrs. Thatcher and her Western allies failed to put
enough pressure on South Africa to end its legal syustem of racial

   Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers on Sunday
began a visit to Israel that was expected to create friction over
the crackdown on Palestinian demonstrators. A soldier shot and
killed a Palestinian who allegedly tried to grab his rifle.
   Also Sunday, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres appeared to break new
ground by saying he was willing to negotiate separately with
Palestinian representatives. Previously, Peres and other leaders
have called for talks with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
   Lubbers was the most senior foreign leader to visit the Jewish
state since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8.
   The Dutch leader hinted from the outset he would be critical of
Israel's handling of the uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, in which 223 Palestinians and four Israelis have been
killed.
   ``To disagree is a privilege of friends,'' Lubbers said during a
welcoming ceremony near Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office.
``We are with you even if we speak up. We speak up because we are
with you.''
   Later, at a state dinner given by Shamir, Lubbers said of the
Israeli response to the uprising: ``The harsh measures that have
been taken in attempting to normalize the situation have left
disturbing images in the minds of many of Israel's friends.''
   He also called on Israel to participate in an international
Middle East peace conference that would be under United Nations
auspices and to withdraw from the occupied lands in exchange for
peace. ``Claiming peace but denying land will be in our view
incompatible,'' he said.
   Shamir opposes an international peace conference that would
include the Soviet Union and the four other permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council, saying concessions would be demanded
that would jeopardize the Jewish state. Shamir, head of the
right-wing Likud bloc, also has said Israel would not withdraw from
the occupied territories.
   Shamir acknowledged he disagreed with the Dutch leader on some
Middle East issues but said he hoped the Netherlands would defend
Israel against the ``campaign of vilification that is being waged
against us on that continent.''
   Earlier Sunday, Lubbers met with Shamir for about 30 minutes and
they agreed to postpone working discussions until Monday, Israeli
officials said.
   In the latest violence, a soldier in the Israeli town of Petach
Tikva fatally shot a Palestinian after the man jumped him from
behind, grabbed his throat and tried to steal his rifle, police
said.
   The soldier, Yossi Hadas, 18, said he was waiting at a busy
intersection to hitch a ride to his base when he was assaulted.
   ``An Arab jumped me from behind,'' Hadas told Israel army radio.
``I jabbed my elbow into his ribs, pushed him aside, moved away,
put my magazine inside, cocked the rifle and fired.''
   Petach Tikvah police commander Yaacov Shoval said the assailant
tried to strangle the soldier as he grabbed the rifle.
   The assailant, a 21-year-old West Bank resident, died of a
gunshot wound in the chest at nearby Beilinson Hospital, police
said. Israel radio gave his name as Yassin Mahazou.
   The radio report quoted police as saying the attacker apparently
planned to kidnap the soldier. It said another Palestinian was
arrested in connection with the attack.
   Also Sunday, troops opened fire on stone-throwing Palestinians
in the West Bank village of Qabatiyeh, wounding an 18-year-old Arab
in the leg, officials at nearby Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus said.
The army said it was checking the report.
   Peres, head of the left-of-center Labor Party, told Israel
television that ``we are willing to negotiate separately with the
Palestinians,'' but emphasized such talks would not include the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO, which it considers a
terrorist group.

   A bus braking to avoid three cows
crossing a road was struck in the rear by another bus in foggy
weather Sunday and 38 people were killed, police reported.
   They said dozens of passengers were injured in the accident but
they did not have the exact figure.
   The bus that was rear-ended went off the road and into a lake
and many of the victims drowned when they were trapped in the
partially submerged vehicle, according to police. They said all of
the bodies were recovered and there were no foreigners on either
bus.
   All of the people who perished were on the first bus that was
carrying 50 passengers, according to the television network TV
Globo. It said there were 45 passengers aboard the second bus.
   Police spokesman Elias Campos said the buses were making the
335-mile trip from Londrina in the southern state of Parana to an
industrical center near Campinas when the accident occurred.
   ``It was early morning, foggy and the road is narrow,'' said
Campos who was contacted by telephone in Piracicaba, a town 165
miles west of Sao Paulo and near the site of the accident.
   ``Three cows crossed the road, the first driver braked suddenly
and the second smashed into the back of the bus, pushing the first
vehicle into a roadside lake,'' Campos said.
   He said both bus drivers survived.

   Thunderstorms spread rain over parts of the central Plains, the
South and the Northeast on Sunday, and more high temperature
records were toppled in the East and in California, where even San
Francisco topped 100 degrees.
   A low pressure system over northwestern Oklahoma scattered
thunderstorms with generous rain over much of Kansas and into parts
of western Missouri. El Dorado, Kan., got 2.52 inches of rain in a
day and a half and other parts of central and eastern Kansas got up
to 2 inches of rain in 24 hours.
   Thunderstorms rumbled over parts of New York state, Vermont and
north-central Pennsylvania while a cold front slowly moved into the
area. Rochester, N.Y., got more than an inch and a quarter of rain
in an hour during the morning, and Elmira, N.Y., got wind gusts to
54 mph. Buffalo, N.Y., got 1.39 inches of rain in the six hours up
to 2 p.m. EDT.
   The roofs of an apartment building and a house in Pottstown,
Pa., were ripped off Sunday night by what local authorities
described as a tornado. No injuries were reported. The National
Weather Service said radar showed there were several severe
thunderstorms in the area, but that no tornado was confirmed.
   A weak low pressure system anchored over extreme southern
Alabama spread showers and thunderstorms from the lower Mississippi
Valley through the central and eastern Gulf Coast, and Pensacola,
Fla., got 2.53 inches of rain during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Philadelphia hit a record high of 103 degrees, also setting a
record for the number of consecutive days in a year of 100-degree
temperatures. Sunday was the fifth day in a row that the area
posted a temperature of 100 degrees or better.
   Downtown Baltimore reached a record 103, and that was a record
eighth time this year that the city has hit 100 degrees or better.
   Other record highs were 97 at Allentown, Pa.; and 101 at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport; while Huntington,
W.Va., tied its record of 100 and Newark, N.J., tied its record of
99.
   Parts of California also were heating up while high pressure
built up off the Pacific Coast. It took one hour for the
temperature to jump 10 degrees to a record 84 in downtown San
Francisco, and the city later climbed to 103, the hottest there for
any time of year in about 125 years of record-keeping.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 61
degrees at Whidbey Island, Wash., to 110 at Needles, Calif. Sunday
morning's low was 37 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the central high Plains through the lower Missouri and middle
Mississippi valleys, the lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the
middle and southern Atlantic Coast into the central and eastern
Gulf Coast and Florida.
   Highs in the upper 70s were predicted across north-central
Montana, and across the northern parts of the northern Plains and
upper Mississippi Valley; around 100 across southwestern Oklahoma
and central Texas into the Rio Grande Valley; between 100 and 110
in the desert Southwest and the California valleys, but up to 115
in the southern and northern valleys of California; and in the 80s
or 90s across much of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   The organizer of Jimmy Swaggart's first
crusade outside his home state since the evangelist was defrocked
said he expects thousands of followers to defy the Assemblies of
God church and attend the event.
   The Rev. Mike Baldock, pastor of the independent New Covenant
Church and organizer of the July 22-24 crusade at Market Square
Arena, says he believes about 8,000 people will attend each of the
three meetings planned this weekend.
   Swaggart has not preached outside Louisiana since February, when
he tearfully admitted sinning against God and his family. A
prostitute in suburban New Orleans said Swaggart, of Baton Rouge,
paid her to perform lewd acts.
   The Assemblies of God dismissed Swaggart on April 8, after he
refused an order to refrain from preaching for a year and receive
professional counseling. He returned to the pulpit of his
independent ministry May 22.
   Juleen Turnage, a spokeswoman at the Assemblies of God
headquarters in Springfield, Mo., said individual pastors must
decide whether to support the Indianapolis crusade.
   Officials of the Northwest Assembly of God Church here ``made a
decision not to cooperate'' with the crusade in any way, said
Lucille Sexton, an aide to the Rev. Blanche Fiscus.
   ``Pastors have had instructions'' from the national and state
offices of the Assemblies of God not to have anything to do with
Swaggart activities, Sexton said.
   ``I would be surprised if any Assemblies of God people
attended,'' she added.
   The Rev. Charles Shank, district superintendent of the
Pentecostal denomination, also said pastors have been advised not
to support or cooperate with Swaggart.
   ``He has been disciplined by the church and isn't part of our
fellowship,'' Shank said.
   Baldock said he has had no trouble recruiting more than 500
volunteers, 200 ushers and a security force to help with the
weekend revival meetings.
   ``Market Square Arena provides a security force (for the arena),
but we provide one for the security of Brother Swaggart,'' he said.
   ``You always end up with some people who are hecklers,'' Baldock
said, adding that he is concerned some people might try to bring
banners derogatory to Swaggart into the arena.
   The Rev. Delores Fisher of the non-denominational Bethel Chapel
said she believes many members of the Assemblies of God will turn
out for Swaggart.
   ``I think a lot of them will go,'' she said. ``Preachers are no
different from the laity. They shouldn't be scorned because they
are human.''

   Jesse Jackson transformed a Sunday evening
reception by the Democratic National Committee's Black Caucus to
honor civil rights heroes into a fund-raiser for a political action
committee he intends to develop after the convention ends this week.
   Jackson said the PAC will focus on economic issues, the 1990
census and reapportionment of congressional districts.
   He set the goal of raising $2 million in 400 contributions of
$5,000 apiece to form the ``Keep Hope Alive PAC.'' Staffers began
distributing enrollment forms and envelopes for contributions, and
he said $100,000 already had been raised a week ago.
   ``We get our mandate from Fannie Lou Hamer, ... from Dr. (Martin
Luther) King,'' he said in a pre-emptive defense of the formation
of the PAC. Ms. Hamer led and won a credentials battle at the 1968
convention to seat members of the Mississippi Democratic Freedom
Party instead of the regular state delegation.
   He said the PAC's goal would be to get more blacks and other
minorities to run for office.
   ``Only by running are you going to open up this process,'' he
told the crowd of about 500 at the Atlanta Life Insurance building
who had come to pay tribute to the ``Drum Majors of the Dream.''
   Eight individuals, including Jackson, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy,
Myrlie Evers, Coretta Scott King, Georgia Rep. John Lewis, the Rev.
Joseph Lowery, Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and Rosa Parks were
honored for their roles in the civil rights movement of the '60s.
   With former rival Sen. Albert Gore Jr. at the podium, Jackson
spoke pointedly about the tensions and negotiations going on
between his campaign staff and those of the all-but-certain
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``We are at a moment of deliberation, development and
challenge,'' he said. ``We are just an attitude away from the White
House.''
   In a reference to Dukakis, he said the issues facing the
Democratic Party were bigger than any one person.
   ``The issue is having a seat in the budget next January. We can
cut the defense budget without cutting our defense,'' he said.
   He acknowledged that the right wing of the party had been
accommodated in Dukakis' selection of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as
his running mate but said, ``You need two wings to fly.''
   ``We can afford to lose a vote on the floor but not our
integrity,'' he added.
   Jackson also warned that the PAC would hold accountable those
Democratic officeholders coming to the convention as super
delegates from areas where he won a significant percentage of the
vote in the primaries and caucuses.
   ``We must visit those senators and governors whose states we won
but are not voting for us and find out what their plans are for the
future for private and public life.''

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis celebrated his
first night in Atlanta at a private family Sunday dinner hosted by
one of his cousins, a well-known restaurateur.
   Dukakis, his wife Kitty and their children were joined at the
restaurant, 103 West, by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, Dukakis'
designated running mate.
   The two men _ who arrived Sunday in Atlanta for the Democratic
National Convention beginning Monday _ were in a private room at
the restaurant while downstairs, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy
held another private party. Also dining at the restaurant was Sen.
Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii.
   Elaine LaMontagne, a spokeswoman for the restaurant, said Pano
Karatassos, the owner, is a second cousin of Dukakis. Their
grandmothers were first cousins, LaMontagne said.
   ``They keep in touch with what the families are doing,'' she
said.
   Karatassos, who was born in Savannah and moved to Atlanta about
10 years ago, has been active in the Dukakis campaign since the
Massachusetts governor announced his drive for the presidential
nomination.
   The six-course meal consisted of lump crab cake, gazpacho,
grapefruit sorbet, Maine lobster and red snapper ragout in a
sauterne wine sauce, fresh fruit, assorted pastries and ice cream.

   Two dogs owned by Irish film producer
Kevin McClory attacked a retired California judge near her vacation
home, biting her more than 50 times, her husband said Sunday.
   Richard Rogan said his wife, 72-year-old Mary Goode Rogan, a
former Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, is recovering in a
hospital after undergoing surgery for wounds suffered in the July 5
attack.
   Rogan, of Burbank, Calif., said McClory has disappeared with the
dogs, both boxers, despite a court order that the animals be
destroyed.
   Rogan spoke with reporters and his remarks were carried by the
news agency Ireland International.
   McClory, whose credits include the 1965 James Bond movie
``Thunderball,'' has lived since November in a five-room apartment
at the Rogans' summer home, St. Cleran's, according to Rogan.
   The only response to telephone calls to McClory's apartment was
an answering machine.
   Police in County Galway said an order that the dogs be destroyed
was issued Wednesday at Loughrea District Court, but McClory did
not attend the hearing.
   ``We are told the dogs have been taken away for training,'' said
one officer who was not identified in line with police regulations.
``We have tried to contact Mr. McClory but we have been told he is
away seeking film locations.''
   McClory's wife, Elisabeth, is the daughter of Vincent O'Brien,
one of Ireland's leading horse trainers. A spokesman for the
O'Brien family, who spoke with the condition he not be identified,
said Sunday he believed McClory was ``somewhere in the west of
Ireland'' looking for film locations.
   Rogan said his wife was attacked while walking in a meadow near
the house in County Galway in eastern Ireland.

   A crowded Amazon ferryboat that
crashed into a partially submerged wreck near the northeastern port
of Belem has left at least 55 dead, officials said Sunday.
   About 50 people were pulled from Belem Bay shortly after the
accident Friday night, but Robert Silva, a Belem port authority
spokesman, said as many as 70 people may have drowned.
   As night fell Sunday, volunteers and the coast guard suspended
efforts to look for more survivors.
   The ferry, with a capacity of 60 people, drifted off course into
an area known as the ``boat cemetery'' as the captain tried to
avoid what he thought was a coast guard launch, according to the
Jornal do Brasil newspaper.
   According to the daily, the same boat received several citations
recently for traveling overloaded.
   The ferry was headed from Belem 2,070 miles north of Rio to the
nearby island of Marajo, located near the mouth of the Amazon river.

   More than 400 members of the Rittenhouse
clan, some from as far away as West Germany and England, gathered
to share family gossip and history over the weekend at the
tricentennial celebration of Wilhelm Rittenhausen's arrival in
America.
   People hovered over genealogical charts, running their fingers
down the litany of names, searching for descendents of Rittenhausen
_ cousins, great-great-uncles, or half-remembered names first heard
in childhood stories.
   Paul Monroe Rittenhouse of State College manned the genealogical
tables, helping distant relatives fill in the blanks in their
record books, noting marriages, births, deaths.
   ``We're here to fill in the voids'' of the family's history, he
said.
   Although family members began tracing their ancestors more than
100 years ago, Paul Rittenhouse recently found a ``missing link''
in 19th-century documents from Lancaster County. Those documents
added more than 3,000 families to the Rittenhouse lists, bringing
the total, in this country, to 50,000 descendents of Rittenhausen.
   Charlotte Rittinghausen, of Mannheim, West Germany, came to
visit friends at the celebration, which ended Sunday. She said her
father is interested in the family history, but she wasn't until
the American celebration.
   Ms. Rittinghausen said she is continually learning of family
members in her country. Now she has more names to add to her
Christmas card list.
   ``We are spreading all over,'' she said.
   Rittenhausen settled in Germantown, the country's first
permanent German settlement, in 1688. He built a papermill in 1690
on the Monoshone Creek in Philadelphia and became the American
colony's first papermaker.
   His name, itself a derivation of Rittinghausen, was changed
erroneously by American clerks, according to Rittenhausen decendant
Milton Rubincam of West Hyattsville, Md. Rubincam called the name
change ``a peculiarity of Colonial times,'' when American
immigrants were confronted by strange languages and names.
   ``It doesn't matter what your name is. It's fun for everybody to
trace their roots,'' said one of two Donald Rittenhouses at the
reunion. ``I've been doing research for 10 years, just to see where
it goes,'' said the retired salesman and financial officer from
Minneapolis.

<HEAD>Insurance Companies: AIDS Screenings Help Pinpoint Other Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some insurance companies say that testing
more applicants for exposure to AIDS has benefited the industry by
helping identify other applicant health problems, such as cocaine
use and diabetes.
   Life and health insurers are using the opportunity offered by
increased AIDS testing to perform more general screenings on the
blood and urine of applicants. When abnormal readings turn up,
insurers sometimes deny applications for coverage or charge higher
premiums, industry officials said.
   ``AIDS is the best thing that ever happened to the
life-insurance industry,'' said David Richman, a vice president at
Associated Benefits Inc. in Plainville. ``It's the best thing as
far as underwriting. Insurance companies can now underwrite with
much more information.''
   Until recent years, a consumer could buy several hundred
thousand dollars of life insurance by answering medical questions
on an application, without submitting to blood or urine tests. But
with growing concern about acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
companies began requiring AIDS antibody tests of applicants for
amounts of life insurance above certain threshholds, commonly
$100,000 worth of insurance.
   Insurers also often require AIDS tests of people applying for
individual health policies. Travelers, for instance, requires the
tests for most of its individual health policies.
   Companies will not insure people with positive AIDS antibody
test results because of the increased likelihood they will develop
the syndrome, and they will not insure cocaine users.
   When insurers require blood to be drawn for an AIDS tests, they
generally have a laboratory screen it for other problems, and also
order a urine test. A typical blood and urine screening costs the
insurer $50 to $75 per person, said George Kelly, an associate
counsel at Hartford Insurance Group.
   The lab checks blood for sugar levels, fats and protein and
looks for signs of cardiovascular disease, liver and kidney
disorders. Companies also are checking urine for nicotine, to
verify whether people who say they are non-smokers are telling the
truth, and for problems associated with heavy drinking.
   Prudential said it is rejecting about 3 percent of applications
for individual life insurance, compared with 2 percent two years
ago, but Testa was not sure how much of the increase is due to
increased blood testing.
   Aetna would not say how often it denies applications because of
positive AIDS tests and said it did not track denials for other
medical causes.
   Travelers said testing is revealing more conditions that warrant
higher rates or rejection of an applicant. But spokesman Scott
Bushnell said that when an insurer knows it is discovering more of
its customers' problems through tests, its rates will reflect fewer
cost for unknown risks.
   ``If we can better classify people's mortality risk, actuaries
can sharpen their pencils in terms of pricing,'' Kelly said. ``The
better we can underwrite, the more narrowly we can price, and
everyone's better off.''
