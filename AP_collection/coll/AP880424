<HEAD>Guam To Send Uncommitted Delegation to Democratic Presidential
Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats in this U.S. territory decided
Sunday to send an uncommitted delegation to the national convention
in an attempt to have more political clout when the party selects
its presidential nominee.
   ``The idea behind our uncommitted stance was to allow the Guam
delegation to discuss Guam issues so more people could become aware
of what we want,'' Daryl Taggerty, vice chairman of the party's
delegate selection committee, said Sunday following the party's
caucuses.
   Topping the list of concerns in the territory's effort to become
a commonwealth of the United States.
   Party members selected six delegates, each of whom will cast {
vote for a total of three votes.
   One member of the delegation is former territorial Gov. Ricardo
J. Bordallo, who was unseated in 1986 after he was indicted for
accepting bribes in exchange for government contracts. He was later
convicted, but remains free pending appeal in federal courts.
   Bordallo's wife, territorial Sen. Madeleine Bordallo, also was
selected as a delegate. Most of the other delegates are former
members of Bordallo's cabinet.

<HEAD>Government Television Denounces U.S. Media</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A program Sunday on
government-run television accused the U.S. news media of ``bias,
hostility and missionary zeal'' in its reporting on South Africa.
   The 30-minute South African Broadcasting Corp. program said the
U.S. media focused only on violence and black-white confrontation,
ignoring positive developments.
   The program included interviews with officials from such U.S.
groups as the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise
Institute and the Hoover Institution.
   No journalists working for American news organizations in South
Africa appeared on the program.
   ``The American media simply are not going to give a fair shake
to South Africa,'' said William Rusher, publisher of the
conservative U.S. journal National Review.
   Program narrator Cliff Saunders said many foreign television
organizations ``dash into South Africa, shoot a documentary in
frantic haste, then dash home to tell a story which in no way
reflects insight into the South African situation.''
   The three largest American televison networks, ABC, NBC and CBS,
all have permanent bureaus in South Africa.
   ``But ignorance and haste are only part of the problem,''
Saunders said. ``Outright bias, hostility and a missionary zeal to
discredit South African conditions are widespread.''
   The program did not cite any inaccuracies reported in the U.S.
media and mentioned only two American news organizations by name,
CBS and ABC.
   It showed brief footage from black townships that appeared in
the CBS documentary, ``Children of Apartheid.'' The program aired
in December.
   Minister of Home Affairs Stoffel Botha called the CBS program a
``blatant distortion that should be condemned with the contempt it
deserves.''
   Botha and his department monitor the South African and foreign
news media under the nationwide state of emergency in effect since
June 1986.
   The restrictions prevent journalists from reporting
disturbances, security force actions and most forms of protest.
   All of the Americans interviewed agreed that the media crackdown
has reduced U.S. television coverage of South Africa.
   ``The government has been remarkably effective in pushing South
Africa off the (U.S.) evening news,'' said Stanford Ungar, a
professor at American University in Washington.

<HEAD>Aquino Says Marcos Not Welcome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>

   President Corazon Aquino said Sunday
she has no intention of allowing former President Ferdinand E.
Marcos to return to the country.
   ``I just want our people to know and to reassure them that I
will never do anything that will go against the interests of the
Filipino people,'' Mrs. Aquino said during her weekly radio program
``Ask the President.''
   She was responding to two women callers who said they were
disappointed that she had sent emissaries early this year to meet
with Marcos.
   Marcos has been living in Hawaii since his regime toppled by a
February 1986 revolt that swept Aquino to power.
   One of the women said she was disappointed because of reports
that government representatives were negotiating with Marcos for
his possible return. Mrs. Aquino's spokesmen had earlier denied the
reports.
   Marcos told reporters in Honolulu last week that negotiations
with Mrs. Aquino's government were continuing and he was told he
could return in two months to act as government adviser.
   Mrs. Aquino said she sent two of her relatives to meet with
Marcos last January and February because she had heard his health
was ``really deteriorating very fast'' and that he had a message
for her.
   ``My directions to my relatives ... were very clear _ just to
listen to what Mr. Marcos had to say,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``Never
did I say that he could come back or that I wanted him to advise me
and help me (find) the solutions to our problems.
   ``I think you also heard me say in the past that many of our
problems were caused in fact by Mr. Marcos,'' the president added.
   Government officials have said Mrs. Aquino does not want Marcos
to return because his followers still are capable of plots to
destabilize the government.
   Meanwhile, two gunmen fatally shot a bodyguard of the mayor of
suburban Makati early Sunday outside the mayor's home, police said.
   Police quoted witnesses as saying the assailants shouted ``don't
interfere, we're the NPA,'' referring to the Communist New Peoples
Army. Communist rebels have been waging a 19-year insurgency.
   The victim, Rodolfo Abratique, was the second bodyguard of Mayor
Jejomar Binay slain in the past week.

   Jesse Jackson said Sunday he would be
willing to talk with those holding U.S. hostages in Lebanon, and
suggested that he would be more effective in winning their freedom
that would his Democratic presidential rival, Michael Dukakis.
   The Reagan administration has refused as a matter of policy to
negotiate with hostage-takers. Jackson said he would be willing to
talk to anyone _ including the kidnappers.
   ``In this world, in this ambiguous world, you must not set up
preconditions that stop effectiveness,'' Jackson said at a rally in
Washington. ``I would meet with anyone I could meet with to get the
hostages out of Beirut.''
   Jackson's remarks came in the final weekend of the Pennsylvania
primary campaign, as he and Dukakis set aside their best-friends
campaign style. Dukakis rejected as ``absurd'' Jackson's suggestion
that he offer specific budget figures for programs he favors.
   Both candidates sounded jobs themes as they campaigned in this
industrial state. Dukakis talked about steel industry jobs and
economic development during a whistle-stop train trip through the
western half of the state.
   Jackson spent the night with an unemployed steelworker and his
family in Aliquippa, preached at a local church and met with
paperworkers in Lock Haven before flying to Washington.
   Dukakis is considered a sure bet to win most of the 178
Democratic convention delegations at stake in the Pennsylvania on
Tuesday. Jackson's best chance to make an impression would be in
the non-binding preference vote that also will be part of Tuesday's
ballot.
   With 78 Republican delegates also at stake, Vice President
George Bush should reach the 1,139 total he needs to clinch the GOP
presidential nomination with a majority of the delegates to the
Republican National Convention in August in New Orleans.
   ``Vote 12 times for Mike Dukakis,'' said fliers being
distributed to Democratic voters in the state's 2nd Congressional
District. That appeal was not an invitation to vote fraud, but an
effort to help voters understand the long and complex ballot that
will confront them Tuesday.
   Democratic voters will elect delegates identified as supporters
of Dukakis or Jackson. For Republicans the task is even more
difficult since the ballot will not identify the presidential
preference of delegate candidates.
   The Dukakis campaign was spending $25,000 on radio commercials
that begin:
   ``On April 26 in the Pennsylvania primary, one vote for Mike
Dukakis won't be enough. If you want to help send Mike to the White
House, you've got to vote for all the Dukakis delegates in our
area.''
   The Jackson campaign also was distributing fliers explaining to
voters what they must do to support the former civil rights
activist.
   Jackson's delegate strength is concentrated in Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh where the vast majority of the state's black voters
live. Dukakis is expected to win most of the delegates in other
parts of the state.
   Meanwhile, Democrats in the U.S. territory of Guam decided
Sunday that its six delegates _ representing three votes at the
national convention _ will remain uncommitted in an attempt to have
more political clout.
   ``The idea behind our uncommitted stance was to allow the Guam
delegation to discuss Guam issues so more people could become aware
of what we want,'' Daryl Taggerty, vice chairman of the party's
delegate selection committee, said Sunday following the party's
caucuses.
   The Guam delegation includes former territorial Gov. Ricardo J.
Bordallo, who was convicted of accepting bribes in exchange for
government contracts but remains free pending appeal in federal
courts.
   While Dukakis and Jackson battled for Democratic delegates in
Pennsylvania, conservative Republicans were trying to influence
Bush's selection of a running mate.
   Curt Clinkscales, a conservative activist, has formed an
unauthorized committee to raise money to promote former U.N.
ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick as the GOP vice presidential candidate.
   Mark Salter, a spokesman for Mrs. Kirkpatrick, said, ``She
believes the decision on the vice president should be solely that
of Vice President Bush.''
   The former U.N. ambassador, a favorite of conservatives because
of her hardline views on foreign policy, briefly considered getting
into the presidential race, but finally decided against it.
   Clinkscales said he has raised $100,000 and collected the names
of 1,400 volunteers.
   Through most of the Pennsylvania campaign, Dukakis and Jackson
avoided any criticism of each other, concentrating instead on Bush
and the Reagan administration.
   Their nice-guy approach was strained slightly Saturday night
when they debated in Pittsburgh and Jackson chided Dukakis for
failing to attach price tags to his proposals.
   ``I'm not just for Head Start, I'm willing to pay for Head
Start,'' Jackson said during the debate. ``I have put numbers
together to pay for my dreams.''
   After the debate, Jackson said Dukakis had failed ``to answer
the budget question. ... I know it's good to project for a national
health care plan, which I support. But it will cost.''
   ``I don't know what he's trying to do,'' Dukakis said Sunday
when asked about the pressure from Jackson to come up with budget
figures.
   ``You can't prepare a budget now for next year,'' he told
reporters on his campaign train. ``That's absurd.''
   On the hostage question, Jackson criticized Dukakis' stance that
terrorists should not be negotiated with.
   ``I've raised the point in several debates this year,'' Jackson
said. ``Every time a question comes up about terrorism, Mr. Dukakis
says: `I'm against terrorism.... We should not negotiate with
terrorists. In the Middle East, never negotiate with terrorists. Be
tough.'''
   ``I disagree with that,'' Jackson went on. ``If I could get
those hostages out, I would bring them back home.''
   He said making a deal with kidnappers would be no worse than
dealing with the likes of Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   ``We say now if Noriega will come out of Panama, we'll send him
to another country. That's a concession.... But the fact is, the
object must be to free Americans who are held hostage in the Middle
East.''
   Nine Americans are believed held by kidnappers in Lebanon. They
are: Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press; Thomas Sutherland; Frank Herbert Reed; Joseph
James Cicippio; Edward Austin Tracy; Jesse Turner; Robert Polhill;
Alann Steen and Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.
   Jackson spent Saturday night with 35-year-old Doug Cafrelli and
his wife and five children. After working 13 years at LTV Steel,
Cafrelli was laid off in 1985.
   He said he got a call Saturday asking if he'd be willing to have
Jackson as a house guest for one night.
   ``I was in a daze, in a dream,'' he said.
   The next morning, Jackson sat with Mr. and Mrs. Cafrelli at the
kitchen table in their two-story frame house and had a breakfast
scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage. Then he preached at the local
Methodist church.

<TEXT>
   The bodies of a missing woman and her two
sons were found Saturday in a desert wash more than a week after
they disappeared, but officials said there was no evidence of foul
play.
   The bodies of Penny Lopez, 26 and her 3-month-old son, Jeremy
Michael were spotted at 8:45 a.m. Saturday by San Bernardino County
sheriff's officials in a helicopter, Deputy Tony Valencia said.
   The body of 4-year-old Christopher John Lopez was found about
eight hours later, following an intensive search in driving,
wind-whipped rain with temperatures in the low 40s, Valencia said.
   About 70 people using aircraft, horses, 4-wheel-drive vehicles
and motorcyles searched the remote desert area until they found the
boy's body about a mile south of his brother and mother.
   ``It looks like Christopher turned around and headed back
towards the car,'' Valencia said.
   Mrs. Lopez and the boys were reported missing on April 13. The
woman and her husband, John, had argued in the morning before she
drove away with the boys, authorities said.
   ``We have no indication that there was a physical fight,''
Valencia said.
   Lopez reported his wife and children were missing after Mrs.
Lopez failed to pick up her 6-year-old daughter from school.
   The Barstow woman's car was found on April 20, stuck in soft
sand on an electrical company service road about 15 miles southeast
of Barstow. Footprints led into the desert.
   The woman was wearing jeans and a shirt and was barefoot when
she left. The boys were in their pajamas.
   ``They were not dressed for the weather,'' Valencia said. ``Even
if someone were dressed for it, you couldn't stay out there that
long.''
   The mother and children, who were identified Saturday by a
deputy coroner, were found about 10 miles from the car. But
coroner's officials refused to comment on how long the three had
been dead or what caused their deaths.
   Autopsies had yet to be scheduled, Valencia said.

<HEAD>Resigning Justice Department Official Calls For Anti-Corruption
Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Weld, one of two top Justice
Department officials who recently resigned, says federal laws
should be revised to make it easier to charge state and local
public officials with corruption and to include Congress members
under all anti-corruption laws.
   Weld, who resigned March 29 as head of the Justice Department's
criminal division, said in the opinion section column in The
Washington Post on Sunday that he would not discuss the reasons for
his departure after two years in the department led by embattled
Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   He wrote that the nation greatly underrates public corruption as
a political and economic problem in the United States and said that
corruption is a weed that will grow fast if left unattended, so
legislation at the federal level is necessary.
   ``I, for one, believe that the federal government must take an
active role in the fight against public corruption at all levels,''
he said.
   At a White House meeting on Wednesday, Weld and resigning Deputy
Attorney General Arnold Burns painted a picture of a crippled
department and an attorney general wracked by legal troubles,
according to sources familiar with the half-hour meeting with
President Reagan.
   Sources said Weld told the president that, if it were up to him,
he would seek an indictment against Meese who has been the subject
of a lengthy investigation by an independent counsel.
   In the Washington Post column, Weld said there must be a federal
anti-corruption law to overcome the effects of last year's Supreme
Court decision which limited the ability of federal prosecutors to
charge local officers with abuses of public trust.
   ``Another welcome step would be to apply all existing
anti-corruption statutes to members of Congress,'' he said, noting
that only members of the executive branch and independent agencies
are prohibited from supplementing their salaries with fees and
honoraria for job-related activities.
   Weld said he found attractive the proposal to raise the salary
of all members of Congress to between $150,000 and $175,000 while
prohibiting all honoraria.
   ``One big gain would be ruling out the possibility that fees or
honoraria would influence a legislator's sense of priorities, let
alone his or her vote,'' Weld wrote. ``Moreover, if members did not
have to scramble to suport their families and two residences, they
would have more time to devote to the public's business.
   ``Those higher salaries might also attract to the national
legislature at least some able women and men who would not
otherwise be able to make the sacrifice,'' he said. ``We should
cleanse the system so as to attract them.''

   A boat builder was acquitted on Saturday
for the second time of charges that he killed eight people aboard a
fishing vessel in 1982, ending the longest and most expensive
criminal case in Alaska history.
   John Kenneth Peel, 27, broke into tears and his family cheered
when the jury announced its decision in Juneau Superior Court. He
had been charged in the killing of eight peope aboard the fishing
vessel Investor, which burned near Craig in September 1982.
   ``It's terrible being an innocent man accused of a crime,'' said
Peel, of Bellingham, Wash. ``I just thank God it's over. Justice
did work this time.''
   It was Peel's second trial on eight counts of murder and one
count of arson. The first ended in a hung jury in Ketchikan in 1986.
   Peel, a boat builder who once was a crew member on the Investor,
was accused of killing skipper Mark Coulthurst, his wife, Irene,
two Coulthurst children and four teen-age crew members. He was not
arrested until two years after the crime.
   Prosecutor Mary Anne Henry, who handled both trials, told jurors
the state had bungled the Investor investigation, had no motive and
no physical evidence against Peel.
   But Henry contended the prosecution could prove its case based
on witnesses who said they saw Peel near the Investor around the
time of the killings and in the fishing vessel's skiff after the
larger boat was found burning in a cove.
   Peel was working on another nearby fishing boat at the time.
   The state spent $2 million on the investigation and on Peel's
first trial, which took six months. The state budgeted $700,000 for
the three-month retrial. It has been the longest and most expensive
criminal case in the state's history.
   Jury deliberations began Wednesday evening. The jury forewoman
said members of the panel had agreed not to talk to reporters.
   Peel had been in his parents' custody on a $1 million property
bond since his arrest. His mother said the family will return to
Bellingham ``as fast as we can get there.''
   Defense attorney Phillip Weidner said the family is considering
a lawsuit to seek restitution for the ``years of horror,'' but
declined to say who might be the target of such a suit.
   Weidner contends if the first trial in Ketchikan had been
handled correctly, Peel would have been acquitted there.

   Armed men ambushed a car carrying a
provincial governor, but security guards killed three of the
attackers in a gun battle, the military said Sunday.
   Zambales provincial Gov. Amor Delos and his party were driving
to Delos' home Saturday when they were ambushed by five gunmen
outside of Botolan town, 80 miles northwest of Manila, a military
report from Zambales said.
   The governor's bodyguards engaged the ambushers in a brief
gunfight. Three attackers were killed, including a former policeman
who had deserted his post in neighboring Pampanga province, the
report said.
   There were no casualties in the governor's party, it said. The
report gave no motive for the attack.
   Meanwhile, military officials said communist rebels on Saturday
shot and killed two soldiers, a militiaman and their two civilian
boatmen as the group was patrolling a river in the Pampanga town of
Macabebe.
   In Aurora province, about 60 New People's Army guerrillas
commandeered a bus and two jeeps Saturday and used them to attack a
Philippine Constabulary patrol base near the town of San Luis, 80
miles northeast of the capital.
   Two soldiers were wounded in the fighting and the rebels fled on
foot toward nearby mountains after burning the camp and taking an
unspecified number of firearms, a military report said. It
mentioned no casualties n the rebel side.
   Communists rebels have been waging a 19-year-old insurgency.

<TEXT>
   Actress Irene Rich, who played Will
Rogers' nagging wife in several films before becoming a popular
radio star with the ``Dear John'' program during World War II, died
of heart failure at age 96.
   ``She just wore out. She was delightful and beautiful and
enchanting up to the last,'' her daughter, Frances Rich, said
Saturday. Miss Rich died at her Hope Ranch home on Friday.
   Born Irene Luther in Buffalo, N.Y., the actress appeared in 100
films from 1918 through 1942. She performed regularly with the
Welch's Grape Juice radio variety show on CBS and NBC between 1933
and 1945 and appeared more than 5,000 times in the touring playlet,
``Ask Your Wife.''
   Her career began in short silent films opposite Rogers and she
continued with him, usually playing his nagging wife, in such
talkies as ``They Had to See Paris,'' ``So This is London'' and
``Down to Earth.''
   Rogers later referred to Rich as his ``reel'' wife.
   During World War II, her rendition of ``Dear John'' letters on
the Welch's radio program made the term a catch-phrase for
disastrous letters from home.
   In the 1920s and early 1930s, she was a star at Warner Brothers
Studio, appearing in 21 films, including the original productions
of three classics: ``Lady Windemere's Fan'' in 1925, ``Craig's
Wife'' in 1928; and ``The Champ'' in 1931.
   She is survived by two daughters; two grandsons; and three
great-grandchildren.

   Two men were killed Saturday after their
homemade single-engine airplane crashed in the Pacific Ocean about
four miles south of Point Vicente, a U.S. Coast Guard official said.
   An off-duty Los Angeles County fire paramedic saw the plane dive
into the waters off the Palos Verdes Peninsula about 3 p.m. and
alerted the U.S. Coast Guard, Petty Officer Leo Kay said.
   The pilot was identified as James Reddick, 43, of Lomita, Kay
said. The passenger's name was being withheld until relatives could
be notified.
   A Coast Guard helicopter, a 41-foot patrol boat and an airplane
joined in the search for the plane, which flew out of the Compton
Airport.
   ``The plane is described as a two-seater, home-built aircraft;
asingle-engine Thorp,'' Kay said.
   A Federal Aviation Administration official said the FAA probably
would investigate the accident because it involved a homemade
aircraft.
   Weather did not seem to play a part in the crash, the Coast
Guard spokesman said. Weather during the search was partially
cloudy with no rain, Kay added.

   Five years after a searing report called ``A
Nation At Risk'' warned that American education was sinking beneath
``a rising tide of mediocrity,'' Education Secretary William J.
Bennett says, ``we are still at risk.''
   Bennett in a new report said after five years of education
reform efforts and higher spending, the nation's public schools
have improved only marginally, the Boston Herald reported Sunday.
   ``Too many American students are not now getting the education
they deserve,'' Bennett wrote in the study requested by President
Reagan. He said student achievement continues unacceptably low .
   The administration will mark the fifth anniversary of ``A Nation
At Risk'' on Tuesday at the White House when Bennett will give
President Reagan his own assessment of how the schools are
performing.
   The Bennett report said $56 billion more has been spent on
public schools over the past five years and while there has been
some progress, the improvement is ``at a disappointingly slow pace
and still at excessively low levels of achievement.''
   The education secretary lashed at teacher unions and other
education organizations, saying their ``narrow, self-interested
exercise of political power'' threatens school reform efforts.
   ``Whenever a worthwhile school proposal or legislative
initiative is under consideration, those with a vested interest in
the educational status quo will use political muscle to block
reform,'' he wrote.
   Bennett added, ``And too often the anti-reformers succeed. If
our schools are to improve, that power must be overcome.''
   The National Education Association will mark the anniversary
with a protest Tuesday in Lafayette Park across the street from the
White House. The union president, Mary Hatwood Futrell, has charged
school reform is ``withering on the vine'' due to lack of federal
funds. An NEA flyer promoting the rally bears the headline: ``1983:
A Nation At Risk. 1988: An Administration Asleep.''
   The first wave of school reforms involved top-down efforts by
states to mandate stiffer course requirements and to impose tougher
licensing requirements on teachers. The stick of accountability was
often coupled with the carrot of big pay increases. Teacher
salaries have climbed 35 percent since 1983, from an average of
$20,693 to roughly $28,000.
   More recently, the push has been toward bottom-up reforms aimed
at giving local teachers and school administrators more freedom to
chart their own path toward better schools.
   A 1986 Carnegie task force laid the groundwork for creating a
private, non-profit National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards, but it is still several years away from figuring out how
to recognize outstanding teachers.
   Bennett proposes a common academic curriculum for all students,
more difficult course content and more challenging instruction in
the lower grades and for minority and disadvantaged students. He
also suggests changes in state rules to allow those without
education degrees to become teachers and school principals.
   Some experts echo Bennett's criticism that school reforms have
had little impact on the worst problems.
   According to the Education Commission of the States, 45 states
and the District of Columbia have raised graduation standards since
1980. In 1987, the average high school student had to take nearly
20 units of credit to graduate, up from 17 in 1980.
   But such groups as the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement
of Teaching and the Committee for Economic Development have
concluded school reforms have had little or no impact on urban
schools.
   The Committee for Economic Development, led by top business
executives, said, ``Recent reform efforts have largely bypassed the
problems of the educationally disadvantaged _ the 30 percent of
children facing major risk of educational failure and lifelong
dependency.''
   The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching said
last month, ``The harsh truth is that the reform movement has
largely bypassed our most deeply troubled schools.'' It said such
prescriptions as more homework, more testing and more requirements
for graduation were ``irrelevant to many children _ largely black
and Hispanic _ in our urban schools.''
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said, ``There's no evidence that reform is working for
any of our kids, except for maybe the 20 percent who have always
made it in the traditional school system.''
   Bill Honig, California's superintendent of public instruction,
offers a far more upbeat view of what has happened since ``A Nation
At Risk.''
   Honig said California students are scoring higher on the
Scholastic Aptitude Test as well as state exams and thousands more
are taking three years of math and science. California students
passed 41,000 College Board Advancement Placement exams last year,
up 73 percent from 1984.
   ``It has worked for many kids in inner cities. They're taking
harder courses,'' said Honig and there has has been no jump in
dropout rates, as some had feared.
   ``I'm not saying we're anywhere near where we have to be, but
we're on the right track,'' said Honig.
   The original ``Nation At Risk'' report was the work of the
National Commission on Excellence in Education, a panel of 18
citizens appointed by then-Secretary of Education T.H. Bell in
August 1981 to address ``the widespread public perception that
something is seriously remiss in our educational system.''
   The commission, headed by University of California President
David P. Gardner, called its provocative report an open letter to
the American people.
   ``The educational foundations of our society are presently being
eroded by a rising ride of mediocrity that threatens our very
future as a nation and a people,'' it said.
   ``If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on
America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we
might well have viewed it as an act of war.''
   The commission recommended a longer school-year, competitive
``performance-based'' salaries for teachers, and minimum high
school graduation standards of four years of English, three years
each of math, science and social studies and a half-year of
computer science.
   The commission members, but not Bell, all have been invited to
the White House for Tuesday's ceremony.
   Bell, in his memoirs, ``The Thirteenth Man,'' accused Reagan of
neglecting school reform after the 1984 election. In a recent
interview, Bell said, ``We're doing a better job of educating the
top 60 to 70 percent. ... (But) we've made no progress with respect
to this bottom 30-40 percent _ the dropouts, minorities.
   ``The big push for school reform didn't do a darn thing to solve
that.''

   Afghan rebels stormed and captured a
strategic Soviet-Afghan garrison and opened a new, direct supply
route for weapons, rebel spokesmen said Saturday.
   They said the garrison at Barikot, in Afghanistan's northeast
Kunar province, fell Friday at 1 p.m. after a four-month siege.
   Shortly before that, helicopters airlifted about five infantry
and commando battalions, including a handful of Soviet advisers,
from the installation, the rebels said.
   In Kabul, President Najib confirmed Sunday that guerrillas had
captured the post, but he refused to call it a defeat. He
characterized it as a ``change of positions of the army forces.''
   The capture is a major victory for the anti-communist guerrillas
fighting the Soviet-backed government. It opens a new supply route
over the Pakistani border for U.S., Chinese and other Western
weapons.
   The guerrillas said the operation was led by Commander
Rahmatullah of the Hezb-I-Islami Khalis faction.
   Rahmatullah sent a radio message to guerrilla headquarters in
Pakistan saying the transmission was coming from inside Barikot.
   Before being airlifted, communist forces blew up a major
ammunition dump inside the garrison, apparently to reduce the
guerrilla's war booty, the spokesmen said.
   They said Soviet and Afghan jetfighters made high-altitude
bombing raids while helicopter gunships escorted transport copters
in and out of the garrison.
   Dozens of houses were destroyed in the air raids.
   One report said the garrison and a neighboring village were
still being bombed Saturday afternoon.
   Rebel spokesman Qariburahman Saeed said Soviet-Afghan forces
were trying to destroy Barikot rather than let it remain in
guerrilla hands.
   He said 17 rebels had been killed and 16 wounded in the
operation, but had no casualty figures for Soviet-Afghan troops.
   The attack on Barikot garrison is one of a dozen major military
operations carried out by the guerrillas against the Kabul
government since the United States, the Soviet Union, Pakistan and
Afghanistan signed an agreement in Geneva April 14 to withdraw an
estimated 115,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   The guerrillas, who were not direct party to the accord, have
vowed to continue fighting until the communist government is
overthrown. The Soviets intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979.
   Barikot lies just inside the Afghan border with northern
Pakistan. For the guerrillas, the capture of Barikot would open a
major supply route from Pakistan's border town of Arando to
Afghanistan's northeastern province of Nuristan and Kunar. Arando
is separated from Afghanistan by the Kunar River.
   Pakistan is a staging area for the Afghan resistance, although
Islamabad has pledged in the Geneva accord to stop serving as an
arms conduit when the agreement goes into effect on May 15.

   A 4-month-old baby disappeared from The
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia after a visit Saturday from a
woman who said she was an aunt, police said.
   The woman was being sought for questioning, police Capt. John
Apeldorn said.
   ``We believe she did leave the area with the child, but we don't
have any witnesses,'' Apeldorn said.
   Hospital officials said LaShae Cherry, the daughter of
18-year-old Faye Cherry, had been at the hospital since Monday for
treatment of pneumonia and diarrhea.
   Cheryl Hecht, a nursing supervisor, said the woman who visited
LaShae didn't seem suspicious.
   ``She came into the room where the child was, approached her
knowingly and talked with her, played with her and ... picked her
up after that and took her for a walk,'' Ms. Hecht said.
   The infant was described as black, 27 inches long, weighing 10
pounds, with a birthmark on her right cheek.

   The army on Sunday lifted a four-day ban that
had barred Palestinians in occupied territories from traveling to
Israel, a military spokesman said.
   It also permitted tankers to supply gas stations in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip for the first time in more than a month.
   Soldiers lifted a six-day curfew in more than a dozen towns and
refugee camps on Sunday, permitting thousands of Arabs to reach
their jobs in Israel, the spokesman said.
   But the military said curfews would be imposed for a seventh
straight day on three towns in the West Bank and a refugee camp in
Gaza in an effort to quell unrest that has followed the April 16
assassination of PLO leader Khalil Wazir at his home in a Tunis
suburb.
   Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising had called for a
``Day of Rage'' in the occupied territories Saturday to mark a week
since Wazir's death.
   A paramilitary border policeman shot and killed a Palestinian
man Saturday who attacked him with an ax during a protest in the
West Bank village of Qabatiya, the army said without identifying
the dead man.
   The death brought to 172 the number of Arabs killed since the
uprising began 19 weeks ago. An Israeli teen-ager and an army
soldier also have been slain.

   Gunmen believed to be Sikh militants
shot and killed 13 people in Punjab on Sunday, prompting a police
alert across the northern Indian state, news reports and police
said.
   Sunday's slayings brought the death toll blamed on Sikh radicals
to at least 30 since Friday.
   The killings also triggered tightened security measures in New
Delhi, where police began checking vehicles. Several road blocks
were erected in the city of six million people.
   ``We have reports that Sikh terrorists may try to create public
disorder in the capital, hence the measure,'' said an officer at
the police control center.
   United News of India said that suspected Sikh militants shot and
killed 13 people, including a Sikh woman in six separate attacks in
Punjab state on Sunday.
   Among the dead were seven Sikhs and three Hindus. No other
details were available.
   Sikh radicals, who are campaigning for an independent homeland
in their rich farming state, were blamed for 12 deaths in Punjab on
Friday. On Saturday, five more people died in Sikh radical attacks.
   The latest killings raised to 807 the number of deaths blamed on
Sikh militants in Punjab state since the start of the year. Sikh
militants have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for more
political economy or an independent homeland in Punjab.

   An Iranian gunboat rocketed a Saudi
Arabian-owned tanker in the Strait of Hormuz Sunday, hours after
President Reagan warned Iran to stop attacking neutral ships in the
region, Persian Gulf shipping sources said.
   The tanker, which sustained minor damage, made for the southern
port of Dubai with an unexploded rocket hanging from its punctured
site. But the captain said that the missile fell overboard when the
tanker docked. He reported no explosion.
   Gulf-based shipping executives, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the 37,011-ton Sea Trader was approached by a swarm
of six gunboats as it sailed northward through the strait, gateway
to the gulf. But they said only one Iranian boat took part in the
attack.
   The tanker's Indian skipper, Capt. B.R. Pagarkar, reported that
his ship was only slightly damaged with no casualties among his
Indian crew, the officials said.
   The shipping officials quoted Pagarkar as saying he saw six
speedboats heading in his direction as the tanker was entering the
gulf to take on a cargo of oil at the Saudi port of Ras Tanura.
   ``Five then went in one direction, while one appeared to be
heading for another tanker, and I thought we'd escaped an attack.
But suddenly, it veered toward my ship,'' Pagarkar said.
   The Iranians demanded the Sea Trader's destination and were
preparing to board, when ``suddenly, they began firing with
shoulder-carried guns. They must have fired 10 to 12 rockets,'' the
captain said.
   ``I had no fire and no injuries, and so when I saw that I didn't
require assistance, I just proceeded,'' he said.
   The tanker flies a Liberian flag but is owned by the Bakri
Navigation Co. of Jiddah.
   Reagan warned Saturday that further Iranian attacks on shipping
``will be very costly to Iran and its people.''
   The raid was the first Iranian attack on a neutral merchant ship
since Monday, when Iranian gunboats attacked several vessels during
a series of clashes with the U.S. Navy last Monday.
   The battles began when the U.S. warships blasted two offshore
Iranian oil platforms the Americans said also were used as bases
for Iranian attacks on ships in the so-called ``tanker war,'' a
spillover from the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   The Navy also disabled two Iranian frigates and sank or disabled
four other armed Iranian vessels.
   The platforms were hit in what the United States termed a
``measured response'' for damage to the guided missile frigate USS
Samuel B. Roberts when it hit an Iranian mine April 14.
   Ten of the frigate's crewmen were wounded by the mine blast in a
channel used by the U.S. Navy to escort U.S.-flagged commercial
vessels to and from Kuwait.
   U.S. officials have disclosed that American warships in the gulf
will now be allowed to go to the aid of neutral vessels under
attack. Previously, the Navy was not permitted to intervene in
raids on non-American vessels.
   However, spokesmen for the U.S. Defense Department and the White
House said they knew of no U.S. intervention Sunday to help vessels
under attack in the gulf.

   Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists
threatened Sunday to kill two American hostages if U.S. warships in
the Persian Gulf launch new attacks on Iranian targets.
   The threat was contained in a handwritten statement signed by
the Revolutionarey Justice Organization and delivered to the Beirut
office of a Western news agency.
   Revolutionary Justice holds Joseph James Cicippio, 57, of Valley
Forge, Pennsylvania, and Edward Austin Tracy, 57, of Burlington,
Vermont.
   They are among the 22 foreign hostages held in Lebanon.
   The conservative ad-Diyar newspaper reported earlier Sunday that
a deal to free three French hostages held by another Shiite faction
fell through when the kidnappers reneged on pledges to release them
because the hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner were still in Algiers.
   Kuwaiti officials said when the Algerians negotiated an end to
the 16-day hijack drama Wednesday the Shiite hijackers left the
plane on condition they were given safe passage to another country.
   Sunday's Revolutionary Justice statement was accompanied by a
photograph of Cicippio, the acting comptroller at the American
University of Beirut who was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.
   ``Any new (U.S.) aggression under any pretext or excuse will
lead to the execution of spy Edward Tracy first and Cicippio
secondly,'' the Arabic-language statement said.
   Another Western news agency received a photocopy of a membership
card of an unidentified Lebanese organization bearing Tracy's
photograph to authenticate the statement.
   Tracy, a writer of children's books, was kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986.
   ``The attacks occurring in the gulf will not go unpunished and
will not be as easy as America assumes and defines the beginning
and the end of the aggression,'' the letter said.
   The letter said that if U.S. attacks continued one option would
be to move ``the battle arena to inside America, after which things
will get out of control.'' It did not elaborate.
   The U.S. Navy disabled two Iranian frigates and sank or disabled
four other armed Iranian vessels in the Persian Gulf last Monday.
   U.S. officials said the attack was in retaliation for the mine
strike on an American Navy frigate that left 10 crewmembers injured.
   President Reagan warned Saturday that further Iranian attacks on
neutral shipping ``will be very costly to Iran and its people.''
   U.S. officials have disclosed that American warships in the gulf

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge's decision to give defendant Albert
Hakim access to classified documents in the Iran-Contra case
spotlights the dilemma of ensuring a fair trial while protecting
the nation's secrets.
   Since Hakim has never been granted a security clearance, U.S.
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell's recent decision made clear that
fairness takes precedence over normal security rules in a criminal
trial.
   The judge gave all four defendants access to 300,000 classified
documents to prepare for trial, although anyone in the case faces
stiff penalties for unauthorized disclosure of material in the
documents.
   But Hakim's case is the best example of the problem, because his
background is so different from those of the other defendants.
   Oliver L. North, John M. Poindexter, and Richard V. Secord all
are former military men with wide experience in handling secret
documents and covert operations.
   But Hakim is a businessman of Iranian heritage, who told the
Iran-Contra congressional committees, ``As a businessman, I never
pretended to undertake these activities for philanthropic
purposes.''
   Jerry Rubino, director of security for the Justice Department,
said, ``It does present a problem whenever we can't do traditional
background checks'' for security clearances.
   Rubino said he can't recall any previous case where such broad
access to classified information was granted to someone without a
clearance. Normally, he said, ``The indictment makes it
inappropriate to say this person is trustworthy.''
   The Iran-Contra indictment alleges a broad conspiracy to misuse
a lawful presidential order allowing the secret sales of arms to
Iran.
   The conspirators are accused of using money from the sales to
aid the Nicaraguan Contra rebels when such assistance was banned,
to generate illegal profits for private gain, and to cover up their
activities.
   North was a National Security Council staff member; his boss was
former national security adviser Poindexter; Secord is a former Air
Force major general turned private businessman and Hakim was
Secord's business partner.
   As an NSC staffer, North generated many of the classified
Iran-Contra documents that he will see in the case; so did
Poindexter, who routinely briefed the president on national
security matters and therefore had vast knowledge of the nation's
secrets.
   Secord, who became North's key private sector operative, had
held sensitive Pentagon jobs. He once was in charge of
international security matters and reportedly helped plan an
unexecuted Pentagon mission to Iran in 1980, when 52 Americans were
held hostage at the U.S. embassy there.
   E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., a former assistant U.S. attorney in
Washington who specialized in anti-terrorism prosecutions, said
Reagan administration officials ``probably are very edgy about
letting Hakim see it (the classified information).''
   But he added, ``The problem is, that was the choice the
(independent counsel) knew about before he indicted him.''
   The government has decided on occasion against bringing charges
in some espionage or anti-terrorism cases so it wouldn't risk
disclosure of classified information, Barcella said.
   But far worse for the government was ``graymail,'' a form of
blackmail used by those threatening to expose classified
information if indicted.
   Congress' answer was passage in 1980 of the Classified
Information Procedures Act, which sets up rules for handling
classified information in criminal trials.
   The law allows the judge to take swift retribution against
unauthorized disclosures, by finding a violator in contempt and
jailing him or her immediately.
   In return for the swift contempt penalty that protects the
government's information, the defense is assured the access it
needs to present its side.
   ``The act was structured to equalize the status of a defendant
regardless of whether he has a security clearance,'' said Allan
Adler, a legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``No one should have an advantage. What Congress intended was
that a criminal defendant's ... right (to a fair trial) should not
be impaired by the fact that information relating to the charges is
classified.''
   The act requires the defendant to notify the court and the
prosecution if it plans to use classified documents in the case.
   The court has discretion to work out alternative procedures that
could keep the documents secret, while allowing the trial to
continue.
   For instance, there could be a government statement admitting
relevant facts that the specific classified information would tend
to prove. There could be a summary of the information.
   And if a defendant is prevented by the judge from using
classified information he needs for his defense, the court has
three choices: it can dismiss the indictment in whole or in part,
strike certain prosecution testimony, or rule against the
prosecution on any issue where the information would be relevant.

<TEXT>
   The passage of Maryland's new law banning
cheap handguns stems in part from an epidemic of drug-related
killings, but it also owes a lot to a state senator's embarrassment
at a Washington party.
   What embarrassed state Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller
also made him a center of attention, and that led to a meeting with
a woman who is a driving force in the move for gun control
legislation.
   Miller's secretary misread an invitation to a Gridiron Club
event last year as saying white attire was required, instead of
white tie, so Miller was the only one who showed up in a white
tuxedo.
   He was approached by Sarah Brady, wife of presidential press
secretary James Brady, who was severely injured in the 1981
assassination attempt on President Reagan.
   ``It was unbelievable,'' recalled Miller. ``There I was
red-faced, standing 15 feet from President Reagan, and Sarah Brady
comes over and tries to make me feel at ease. She told me I was the
only thing adding any pizazz to the party.''
   They met again a few weeks ago when Mrs. Brady, who has become
active in the fight for gun control legislation, asked for Miller's
help in pushing a bill that would outlaw the sale and manufacture
in Maryland of cheap handguns commonly known as Saturday Night
Specials.
   ``I was impressed with her and when I was given the opportunity
to help it was the least I could do for her,'' he said.
   The law, which Gov. William Donald Schaefer has promised to
sign, will require a nine-member state board to draw up a list of
acceptable handguns. Those not on the list would be banned in
Maryland, and violators would be liable for stiff fines, up to
$10,000 for each illegal gun sold or manufactured.
   The ban won't go into effect until January 1990, giving the
National Rifle Association a chance next year to try to have it
repealed. NRA officials have vowed to make such an attempt.
   While four other states have laws that ban cheap guns based on
the melting point of a weapon's metal, the Maryland measure is
considered by its supporters to be much broader. They hope it will
be used as a model by other states.
   Gun control advocates also see the Maryland experience as a
useful political primer in how to withstand the powerful NRA.
   ``Miller was absolutely crucial,'' said Del. Peter Franchot, one
of a cadre of lawmakers who pushed the bill through the House of
Delegates.
   ``He just stood up for the gun-control bill and stared down the
NRA,'' Franchot said. ``We just sat back there in awe at the way
Miller pushed the thing through. We would have been nowhere without
the political muscle of the president.''
   Miller acknowledged the role played by Mrs. Brady's personal
lobbying, but said a more important factor was the attitude of the
NRA itself.
   ``The very fact that they were opposed to (banning) guns that
could go past metal detectors turned off a great many
legislators,'' he explained. ``The fact that they were opposed to
banning tin and plastic guns that sell for $29.95 whose sole
purpose is to kill, that told the General Assembly of Maryland that
they weren't interested in a reasonable compromise.''
   Agreeing with that analysis was Michael Beard, director of the
National Coalition to Ban Handguns: ``The NRA, I think, just blew
it. They were too arrogant.''
   Miller, Franchot and Beard also agreed that the recent rash of
shootings by teen-agers hooked into the drug trade in Baltimore and
metropolitan Washington was a crucial factor.
   Credit also was given to effective personal lobbying by Coretta
Scott King, wife of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King,
and other victims of violence.
   Ted Lattanzio, the NRA's director of state and local affairs,
cited those and other factors for creating an ``emotional
hysteria'' that made passage possible.
   ``It was a concerted effort by the governor, other political
leadership, gun-control groups and the media that steamrolled an
unfortunate law, which deludes the public into thinking it will
have an impact on crime, which it won't,'' Lattanzio said.

<HEAD>Double Agent Interviewed For First Time On Soviet Television</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   Soviet spymaster George Blake said in his first
television interview that he has had an ``amazingly good'' life in
the Soviet Union since he escaped from a London prison more than 20
years ago.
   ``Gradually, I got to make some friends, I met my wife, I found
a very interesting job with interesting and pleasant colleagues.
Then my son was born, and my life took a very happy course,'' the
Dutch-born Blake told Soviet television in an interview broadcast
Saturday.
   The broadcast was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in
London.
   Blake, a British subject, was convicted in 1962 of spying for
the Soviet Union while working in British intelligence. His
celebrated case brought a 42-year jail term, one year for every
British agent the prosecution claimed he betrayed to their deaths.
   The spymaster escaped from jail in 1966, and the Sunday Times of
London newspaper said last October he was aided by two leaders of
the British anti-nuclear movement.
   ``Being faced with such a long term of imprisonment makes a man
want to do something about it,'' Blake, 65, said on the late-night
Soviet television program ``Before and After Midnight.''
   ``And I was very lucky in that there were some good people who
sympathized with me, people inside and outside of jail, and who
were ready to help me.''
   Blake said he hid for a few days in an apartment near the
Wormwood Scrubs Prison, moved to another apartment further away and
after two months was smuggled to East Berlin in a van.
   ``And that's how I go to the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   He said his adjustment to the Soviet Union was not easy.
   ``It was for me a different country, different traditions, and
even a different society, so of course it was difficult.''
   As he acquired a family and got a good job, which he did not
identify, Blake said, ``My life has been amazingly good, beyond all
my expectations.''
   News reports in 1971 said Blake was receiving first-class
treatment in the Soviet Union, owning a car and vacationing at
Black Sea resorts.
   The Soviet television announcer introduced Blake as ``an
honorary member of the state security service who has been awarded
the Orders of Lenin and the Combat Red Banner.''
   The announcer described him as an ``outstanding Soviet secret
servicemen.''
   After his jail escape, Blake lived secretly in the Soviet Union
until an interview with him appeared Feb. 14, 1970, in the Soviet
government newspaper Izvestia.
   In that interview, Blake said he became a spy for the Soviet
Union to help in ``exposing and interferring with imperialist
aggression and subversion.''
   Among his exploits was to betray a British spy ring in East
Berlin and a tunnel there which the American CIA and British MI-6
used to monitor Warsaw Pact communications.
   During the 12-minute television interview, Blake spoke about his
work in the Dutch resistance during World War II, his 1942 flight
to Britain, where he joined the British secret service and his
conversion to Communism after studying the works of Marx and Lenin.
   Blake was the second British-Soviet double agent interviewed
recently by Soviet television. Other broadcasts have focused on
Harold ``Kim'' Philby, 76, a former British intelligence officer
who defected to the Soviet Union in 1963.

   Sikh militants fatally shot 13 people in
Punjab on Sunday. Police went on alert across the northern Indian
state and tightened security in the Indian capital.
   Sunday's slayings brought to at least 30 the number of people
killed since Friday in violence blamed on Sikh radicals and more
than 800 since the first of the year.
   In New Delhi, police checked vehicles and set up several road
blocks because of the killings.
   ``We have reports that Sikh terrorists may try to create public
disorder in the capital, hense the measure,'' said an officer at
the police control center of this city of 6 million.
   United News of India said Sunday's killings came in six separate
attacks. Among the dead were seven Sikhs, including one woman, and
three Hindus. Identities of the remaining three were not
immediately known.
   Sikh radicals, fighting for an independent homeland in their
rich farming state, were blamed for 12 deaths in Punjab on Friday.
On Saturday five more people died in Sikh radical attacks.
   The latest killings raised to 807 the number of deaths blamed on
Sikh militants in Punjab state since the start of the year.
   Sikh militants have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for
more political economy or an independent homeland in Punjab.
   Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus.
   Sikhs make up about 2 percent of India's 800 million people but
are in a majority in Punjab. Hindus account for about 80 percent of
the country's population.

   Buddhist priests rang gongs and housewives marched
with their babies as thousands rallied Sunday to protest nuclear
power.
   Police said more than 6,200 people joined the rally at a
downtown park and the march through Tokyo's Ginza district, but
organizers estimated the crowd at 20,000. The sponsors said it was
one of the largest anti-nuclear power demonstrations ever held in
Japan.
   Buddhist priests and nuns rang gongs. Other protesters included
members of environmental, consumer and parents' groups.
   At the rally in downtown Hibiya Park, children staged a drama
showing ways of stopping nuclear power plants.
   The crowd cheered when speakers denounced a recent U.S.-Japan
nuclear agreement that they said will allow Japan to refine and
transport plutonium.
   Some demonstrators wore signs reading ``Protect our children''
and ``Don't repeat Chernobyl,'' referring to the nuclear power
plant accident in the Soviet Union nearly two years ago.

   The number of venereal disease cases in China

   Ye Ganyun, director of the National Venereal Disease Prevention
Consultative Committee, gave no figures but said the number of

   China virtually stamped out VD in the 60s but a few cases were

Ye was quoted as saying.
   Ye said young Chinese are more casual toward sex than before.
   He said more than 70 percent of the VD cases involved men, and
most of them were members of criminal gangs or prositution rings.

<TEXT>
   The Arab uprising has cast a shadow over
Israel's yearlong 40th anniversary bash, with American director
Woody Allen, poet Allen Ginsberg and tennis ace Chris Evert among
celebrities who turned down invitations.
   Israeli organizers hope to stem the wave of cancellations by
assuring reluctant guests that the Arab-Israeli conflict will be a
central theme and that they are free to criticize Israel.
   Some Israelis consider the no-shows another slap in the face to
a nation that throughout its short history has often found itself
isolated and a target of international criticism.
   But others said they won't let it spoil the party.
   ``You have seen the people of Israel truly rejoice, going out
for picnics, going out into the streets,'' said Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's aide, Avi Pazner, referring to last week's
Independence Day celebrations. ``Nobody can take that away.''
   Organizers said many big names remained on the guest list,
including American movie director Robert Wise and Indian-born Zubin
Mehta, conductor of both the New York and Israel Philharmonic
orchestras.
   Israeli organizers had planned an impressive lineup of poetry
readings, film festivals and theater performances as highlights of
Israel's 40th anniversary celebration.
   But in the midst of preparations, the Arab uprising erupted five
months ago, and televised images of Israeli soldiers clubbing Arab
youths and razing houses sparked an international outcry. More than
170 Arabs and two Israelis have died in the unrest.
   ``We are in a war, and it hurts everything, our celebration, our
economy, tourism, our feelings,'' said Yakov Agmon, the chief
coordinator of the anniversary festivities.
   Agmon suffered a major setback last week when five Israeli poets
organizing one of the main events, the ``International Poetry
Week,'' withdrew their support and called on fellow artists to
boycott the June festival.
   ``A government that demolishes civilian houses ... and kills
youths in what can only be termed state terror is not worthy to
have poets come to a government-sponsored festival,'' said Natan
Zach, a founding father of modern Hebrew poetry who lives in Haifa.
   Agmon initially wanted to cancel the festival, but then asked
his staffers to poll the invited poets _ 80 Israelis and 35
foreigners _ to see if there was enough support to go ahead. He
said he would make a decision later this month.
   He would not give names of poets who turned down invitations,
but two of the most prominent, Ginsberg and Soviet poet Yevgeny
Yevtushenko, said they would not attend.
   Ginsberg said in New York he initially accepted, hoping to use
the festival as a ``protest for peace,'' but later withdrew in
solidarity with Zach's decision.
   Organizers of other festivals also said many international
artists were torn about whether to attend.
   ``We got a lot of letters from film directors who said, `how can
we come to Israel and talk about movies when people get murdered?'
'' said Nili Miller, spokeswoman for the weeklong International
Student Film Festival, scheduled for May.
   Ms. Miller said organizers had asked 150 film schools to submit
contributions, and 45 accepted while 50 of the refusals cited
political reasons.
   To overcome such reservations, organizers decided on a 32-hour
retrospective of films on the Arab-Israeli conflict, which has
become the centerpiece of the festival.
   As a result, several prestigious contributors, including the
London International Film School, agreed to attend. ``They now have
a feeling that they're not just coming to talk about art, but to
get involved,'' Ms. Miller said.
   But others, like Allen, turned down the invitation. Allen did
not give a reason, but Ms. Miller suggested his refusal was
politically motivated. Earlier this year, Allen, who is Jewish,
sharply criticized army policies in a letter to The New York Times.
   Ms. Evert and fellow tennis star Brad Gilbert pulled out of a
May tennis benefit tournament for Jerusalem's Shaare Zedek Hospital.
   ``Ms. Evert decided to withdraw mainly because of the political
problems,'' said hospital spokesman Rami Sadan, who canceled the
tournament.
   Some entertainers have chosen another way.
   Theatre du Soleil, a Paris-based avant-garde troupe, agreed to
attend this summer's Israel Festival, an annual performing arts
extravaganza, after telling organizers it would first publish a
statement about its political views in Israeli newspapers.
   In the half-page ad published April 15 in the Jerusalem Post
newspaper, the group described the Arab uprising as justified, but
also asserted Israel's right to exist in peace and security.
   Pazner said he opposed attempts to encourage political debate to
assuage the liberal conscience of VIPs.
   ``It is wrong to turn a national celebration into a political
event,'' Pazner told The AP. ``The Israeli people want to rejoice
without politics.''
   He lashed out at local artists criticizing Israel, calling them
``a small minority of pseudo-intellectuals who believe self-hatred
is the answer to the problems of the Jewish people.''
   Countered Zach: ``He is probably right if he means by
self-hatred that we are having problems with our conscience.''

<HEAD>Jordan's King Says Wazir Slaying May Have Been To Kill Peace
Initiative</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The assassination of the PLO's No. 2 leader
may have been aimed at scuttling Middle East peace efforts, and a
breakdown could lead to a disaster, King Hussein said in a rare
interview broadcast Sunday.
   Hussein condemned the April 16 killing in Tunisia of Khalil
Wazir, military head of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
which he said was ``more than likely'' carried out by Israel.
Israeli sources have said Israel was behind the attack, but the
government has not confirmed it.
   ``I think it will probably mean that tensions in the area will
grow more and conceivable it could be an action in itself which is
aimed at creating the kind of reaction that would destroy the
chances for progress towards peace,'' Hussein said on NBC's Sunday
Today.
   ``Sticks and stones and tear gas (are) causing a lot of damage
... but this area has nuclear weapons within it,'' he said. ``If
there is no solution, the end is an explosion, a disaster. ... I
could see a disaster overtaking all of us ... sooner or later.''
   Palestinian rioting in the West Bank, which Israel captured from
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, and in the Israeli-occupied
Gaza Strip taken from Egypt in the same conflict, has left more
than 170 Arabs and two Israelis dead.
   Hussein, in the interview taped Thursday, also said the United
States is not doing enough to promote peace.
   When asked if he trusted the United States as mediator, he said:
``I have no reason to do so, so far. It's not a question of trust.
It's a question of is the United States willing to ... assume the
responsibilities of a superpower in its position.''
   He said the United States ``has a moral right'' to push Israel
toward a peace settlement.
   He also called on Washington to rally the five-member U.N.
Security Council, which includes the Soviet Union, behind a peace
initiative.

<HEAD>Meese, Bender Families Tied For Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scene: Mel Krupin's restaurant, a favorite
watering hole of the city's power-brokers. The occasion: A
Hanukkah-Christmas luncheon hosted by E. Robert Wallach, Attorney
General Edwin Meese's longtime friend.
   The Nov. 30, 1983, party, thrown by Wallach five years before
his indictment on racketeering charges, attracted about 25 people,
including Meese's wife, Ursula; Charles Wick, head of the U.S.
Information Agency; Sondra Bender, wife of local real estate
magnate Howard M. Bender, and Richard Berendzen, the president of
American University.
   ``Bob seats me between two of my trustees: Sondra Bender and
Ursula Meese,'' Berendzen recalled in his book, ``Is My Armor
Straight? A Year in the Life of a University President.'' Both
women serve on the school's board.
   The Benders, well-known in the capital's social circles, are
part of a wealthy family that has created a real estate empire by
constructing and leasing buildings for the federal government and
private concerns.
   The Benders and the Meeses crop up frequently in Berendzen's
book, written in the form of a diary.
   Recently, the two couples have been brought together in another
way: they have testified before a federal grand jury investigating
Mrs. Meese's $40,000-a-year job at the Multiple Sclerosis Society,
paid for with a grant from the Bender Foundation, the family's
philanthropy. Mrs. Meese and Mrs. Bender are both on the MS
society's board, too.
   Wallach's attorney, George Walker, has said Wallach had a
peripheral role in finding the job for Mrs. Meese.
   After Mrs. Meese started her job in January 1986, a Bender
partnership signed a $50-million lease on a building for Justice
Department workers.
   Independent counsel James McKay is scrutinizing the job and the
real estate deal as part of his inquiry into whether Meese violated
any conflict-of-interest laws covering his personal financial
dealings and his job. Meese has denied any wrongdoing, and said he
knew nothing about the Bender's lease until he read about it in a
newspaper April 14.
   Blake Construction Co., the Benders' company, was awarded $120
million in construction contracts in 1987, according to a survey of
the top 400 construction companies in the United States. The firm
ranked number 181. ENR, a McGraw-Hill magazine, conducted the
survey.
   Jack I. Bender, the patriarch, founded Blake in 1945. His three
sons were involved in the company when he died in 1966. In 1978,
Morton and Stanley Bender, two sons, had net worths of $24 million
and $23 million, respectively, according to records cited by The
Washington Post. The net worth of the third son, Howard Bender, was
not available.
   Blake-built buildings dot the city's landscape: The FBI
building, the U.S. Court of Claims, the executive office buildings
across from the White House, to name a few. Government records show
the Benders and their firm often enter into partnerships with
others to do business.
   Over the years, Bender family members have had their share of
problems with the Internal Revenue Service, and their companies
have been embroiled in legal disputes over contruction contracts.
   One pending case involves Blake Construction's $44 million
contract awarded by the Navy in June 1984 to build the Trident
Training Facility at the submarine base at Kings Bay, Ga.
   The Navy terminated the contract on Dec. 12, 1986 because of
``numerous instances of non-conforming work, safety violations and
labor standards provisions violations,'' a Navy document said.
Blake has appealed the ruling to the Armed Services' Board of
Contract Appeals. No date has been set for a hearing, chairman Paul
Williams said.
   The Benders and Blake also show up on records at U.S. Tax Court.
In 1987, a dispute was settled when Howard and Sondra Bender agreed
to pay $77,387 in additional taxes; Blake agreed to a $648,840
payment in 1983 to resolve a dispute.
   Nine years ago, The Washington Post reported a grand jury in
Baltimore, Md., conducted a tax probe of the financial empire of
Blake's owners, Morton, Stanley and Howard Bender. Morton Bender,
who no longer has a management role at Blake, said no charges were
ever brought against the company.
   Besides real estate, the Bender family owns WWDC, a
rock-and-roll radio station where Mrs. Meese tried out _ but didn't
accept _ a position as a public affairs commentator. Mrs. Meese
went on the payroll at the MS society in January 1986 after
declining the radio job. The money she gets comes from the Bender
Foundation.
   Howard and Sondra Bender are active on the party circuit and
donate large amounts of money to charity, but they do not court
publicity, acquaintances say. They declined to be interviewed, and
referred all calls to their lawyer, Seymour Glanzer, who said he
had no interest in talking about the Benders.
   ``The Benders are quite low-key,'' said Jennifer Johnston, an
editor of ``Dossier,'' a magazine that frequently covers social
events.
   Berendzen describes Mrs. Bender, a slender blonde, as a
hard-driving, attractive woman. ``Though she is 50, she looks 35,
with a broad smile and youthful figure,'' he said. Mrs. Bender is
president of the family's tax-exempt philanthropy with assets of
about $10 million.
   Tax returns filed in 1987 showed the foundation gave away about
$1 million the previous year, with the largest chunk _ $520,000 _
slated for American University.

<HEAD>Despite Forecasts, Stock Market Crash Doesn't Usher in Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was the doomsday that didn't happen. The
October stock market collapse, instead of ushering in a recession
or worse, has been almost a non-event as far as the U.S. economy is
concerned.
   At least that's the opinion of many economists who have been
watching with amazement as a string of economic statistics have
shown better-than-expected growth this year.
   Employment gains have pushed the jobless rate down to a
nine-year low; consumer spending, especially for autos, has been
robust; and American manufacturers are enjoying booming export
sales.
   It wasn't supposed to happen this way. Right after Oct. 19, many
analysts feared that the record 508-point drop in the stock market
would spell 1929 all over again.
   After a loss of a trillion dollars in wealth, nervous consumers
would stop spending. Manufacturers, caught with huge inventories of
unsold goods, would cut back production and lay off workers. That
would push the unemployment rate up and further erode consumer
confidence.
   The result, according to those post-crash forecasts: a recession
starting in the first quarter of 1988, a scenario with ominous
implications for Republican hopes of keeping the White House.
   But many economists believe that instead of declining, the
overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, rose at
a respectable annual rate of 2 percent or better from January
through March. The government will provide the first official look
at the GNP on Tuesday.
   So what went right?
   In the view of economists, the simple answer is that employers,
instead of cutting back on hiring after the stock market crash,
actually boosted hiring.
   In the six months since the market crash, an average of 362,000
new jobs have been added each month, more than twice the size of
the average monthly employment gains before the crash.
   ``The thing that saved the country were those huge gains in
employment,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting
firm and one of the analysts predicting a recession in the
aftermath of the stock crash.
   ``After the crash, you would have thought that employers would
have thrown on the caution light at least for a few months, but
instead they stepped up their hiring and that boosted consumer
confidence,'' Evans said.
   Analysts admit they are somewhat puzzled about why employers
went on a hiring binge, especially since unsold goods were piling
up at an alarming rate in the final three months of the year.
   One factor that kept U.S. hiring strong, they believe, was that
much of the rise in inventories represented imported goods.
Therefore, cutbacks in new orders hurt foreign producers, not
American manufacturers.
   In addition, U.S. export sales remained strong, helped out by
the weak dollar. The Reagan administration is counting on a robust
export sector to provide almost half of the increased economic
growth expected this year and so far that optimism appears
warranted.
   ``The export boom has kept the economy going,'' said Robert
Dederick, chief economist of Northern Trust Co. of Chicago. ``We
are beginning to see secondary benefits as businesses, producing at
high-capacity rates, boost their investment spending.''
   Another factor analysts cite for keeping the economy going was a
rebound in car sales in recent months as automakers re-introduced
incentive programs to get buyers back into the showrooms.
   But analysts say none of these things would have helped without
the spectacular rise in employment, which pushed the jobless rate
down to a nine-year low of 5.6 percent in March.
   ``The key was employment. It stayed strong and that gave
consumers confidence to keep spending, especially for big-ticket
items,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &
Co., a government securities dealer. ``Since the consumer is
two-thirds of our economy, that made the difference.''
   The rebound in consumer spending has brought on a new worry,
however _ that demand might be so strong that inflation is
reignited. Many economists believe that the Federal Reserve
tightened up on credit slightly in March as a way of cooling off
demand and keeping the economy from overheating.
   While interest rates have edged up slightly in recent weeks,
economists are not looking for any dramatic move by the Fed to
boost rates quickly, especially during an election year.
   With the strong gains in employment through March, many
economists have been revising their growth forecasts for the year.
   The Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a financial newsletter, said
that two-thirds of the 51 top economists it surveys each month had
boosted their overall growth forecasts for 1988.
   The consensus estimate now puts GNP growth for all of 1988 at
2.7 percent, substantially above the 1.9 percent growth being
forecast immediately following the market crash. The Reagan
administration is calling for 2.9 percent GNP growth this year.

   A conference for black public

   About 800 people, a record number, were expected to attend the
five-day meeting of the National Forum for Black Public
Administrators, said Melanie Lockwood, program development director
in the group's Washington, D.C., office.
   The annual conference is an opportunity for black governmental
leaders to meet with each other, exchange ideas and recruit,
organizers said.
   One highlight on this year's agenda is Wednesday's panel
discussion on the state of inner cities, featuring Los Angeles
Mayor Tom Bradley and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young.
   But the conference won't be devoted to one issue, Ms. Lockwood
said.
   ``It's kind of a dual focus,'' she explained. ``We're looking at
a lot of management issues that apply to black and white managers.''
   Topics include AIDS, crime and finance management, as well as
racism, the problems of the black middle class, crime in the black
community, minority hiring and promoting black business ventures.
   Ms. Lockwood said the number of black city managers has slipped
since 1979. Although blacks are continuing to move into city
government, they tend to be assistants to executives rather than
top managers, she said.
   ``One of the key goals of the forum is to reverse that
decline,'' she said. ``Right now they (black administrators)
represent less than 1 percent. We're working to empower black
administrators.''
   About 200 early arrivals got a taste of Texas hospitality
Saturday with a rodeo organized by city officials and area ranchers.
   Other speakers scheduled to address the conference include
Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode, Illinois Comptroller Roland
Burris, California Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, Washington Mayor
Marion Barry, and San Francisco Supervisor Willie Kennedy.
   The 5-year-old forum has about 1,500 members, with more than 20
chapters around the country.

   A presidential commission has handed the
festering ailments of the nation's air travel system back to
Congress, which tried but failed to address the problem last year.
   With public complaints peaking about safety, chronically delayed
and canceled flights, lost baggage and confusing fares, a showpiece
bill to protect passengers was pieced together but got bogged down
in the 1987 session.
   Prospects for a new legislative effort are uncertain, even in
light of last week's urgent call by the president's Aviation Safety
Commission for ``decisive'' action.
   The commission's report urged lawmakers to create a new ``safety
czar'' within the Federal Aviation Administration, and to give the
FAA more clout by removing it from the Department of Transportation.
   The commission also suggested that the FAA be freed from
cumbersome government rules that hinder its ability to efficiently
purchase modern equipment and deploy its air traffic controllers
and other employees. In addition, the agency should beef up its
2,000-strong force of inspectors, and become more aggressive in
examining the nation's airlines and smaller carriers, the report
said.
   ``Now is the time for decisive action by Congress and the
executive branch,'' the commission said, noting that air traffic is
expected to continue its rapid growth.
   A bill introduced last year would make the FAA an independent
agency and give it more authority to marshall its own forces. That
legislation is likely to be modified to accommodate some of the
commission's recommendations.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., one of the bill's chief sponsors and
chairman of the Senate aviation subcommittee, had lined up a total
of 50 other co-sponsors by late last week. He hopes his panel can
write the measure's final version next month.
   Complaining in a recent interview of ``political regulation'' of
the FAA by the Transportation Department, Ford said ``The FAA
people need some independence so they can go out and do the things
they think should be done.''
   But opponents question whether altering the relationship between
two federal agencies on a bureaucratic flow chart will have much
effect on how safely and quickly airline passengers can get from
one city to another.
   Some say the plan would leave the FAA without needed oversight,
allowing the agency to develop too cozy a relationship with the
industry it is supposed to regulate.
   ``I think the FAA sees the world through aviators' goggles,''
said Jim Burnett, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, the agency that investigates transportation accidents. ``I
think the effect of this legislation is an industry-relief bill.''
   Industry groups support an independent FAA, but deny that it
will be an agency they can easily influence.
   ``It remains part of the executive branch, it remains part of
government,'' said Edward Stimpson, president of the General
Aviation Manufacturers Association, which represents private plane
builders.
   But important members of Congress involved in aviation matters
remain unconvinced.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the Commerce
Committee, which oversees the aviation subcommittee, said that when
it comes to an agency's clout, ``It's smarter to have that voice at
the cabinet level.''
   Added Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., chairman of the House
aviation subcommittee, ``I don't see the independence of the FAA as
the solution to their major problems.''
   The commission's suggestion that a powerful ``safety czar'' be
established at the FAA _ along with a new committee to oversee
safety regulations _ was met with raised eyebrows in Congress and
seems unlikely to be approved.
   ``That's discombobulation, that's not fixing things up,'' said
Hollings.
   In addition to opposition the proposals face, Congress has a
shortened schedule this year, with time off for campaigning. That
makes action even less likely.
   Some of the commission's recommendations can be implemented by
the FAA and Transportation Department without congressional action,
such as stepping up inspections of airlines.
   The Senate and House each passed bills last year that would
force the airlines to issue detailed monthly reports on late and
delayed flights and other problems. The legislation has gone
nowhere, however, because negotiators from the two chambers cannot
agree on whether the bill should also contain new drug-testing
requirements.
   John M. Albertine, the business executive who headed the safety
commission, remains optimistic that Congress will act this year.
   ``There is a sense in the public's mind that there are problems
in the system that have to be fixed,'' said Albertine, a one-time
congressional staff aide. ``When there is that strong a sense in
the public's mind, around here people begin to pay attention.''

^Intelligence Report: Gorbachev's Economic Reforms Face Problems</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic
reform program ran into problems last year and things aren't likely
to improve in the near future, U.S. intelligence agencies said in a
report released Sunday.
   Unless Gorbachev can do something to turn the economy around, he
may find himself in trouble, said the bleak review which was
conducted jointly by the Central Intelligence Agency and the
Defense Intelligence Agency.
   ``Tension within society and the leadership will increase,'' it
said. ``Bureaucrats will become increasingly frustrated by loss of
privileges and status and by demands that they show greater
initiative. Military leaders are likely to become more and more
uneasy if benefits from the industrial modernization fail to
materialize.''
   ``Soviet citizens will need to see some improvement in living
standards if the regime is to achieve necessary gains in worker
productivity and avoid widespread discontent,'' the study said.
   The report concluded that ``failure to head off these tensions
would, at a minimum, make it more difficult to pursue his economic
program vigorously and could, ultimately call into question his
strong political position at home.''
   Gorbachev and supporters of his reforms have acknowledged
resistance at the highest levels, and there have been reports in
Moscow of conflict over reform measures between Gorbachev and No. 2
Kremlin leader Yegor K. Ligachev.
   Criticism of the slow pace of Gorbachev's reforms earlier led to
the firing of Boris N. Yeltsin as Moscow Communist Party boss.
   The U.S. intelligence study was presented April 13 to the
congressional Joint Economic Committee, and a declassified version
was released by the panel.
   The study is the annual review of the Soviet economy, three
years after Gorbachev came to power. He inherited an aging,
extremely inefficient economy and made its modernization one of his
top priorities, the study noted.
   After some early success, ``Gorbachev's ambitious program to
create a modern, more dynamic Soviet economy ran into trouble in
1987,'' the study said.
   ``Familiar problems with poor weather and transportation
bottlenecks were compounded by the disruptions caused by the
introduction of economic reforms,'' it said.
   The Soviet gross national product, the total value of all goods
and services produced, grew only .5 percent last year, the study
noted. That rate was ``reminiscent of the late Brezhnev period,''
it said, referring to Leonid Brezhnev, a Gorbachev predecessor who
prevailed over a largely stagnant economy in the late 1970s and
early 1980s.
   The study noted that the Soviet GNP grew by 3.9 percent in 1986,
the first full year of Gorbachev's term, compared with .6 percent
in 1985.
   By contrast, the U.S. gross national product grew 2.9 percent,
both in 1986 and 1987. However, the American economy measures a
much larger base and comparisons are difficult.
   The Soviet economy was hampered by bad weather last year,
particularly in agriculture, where output fell three percent, the
study said.
   But industrial quality control measures also ``proved to be
particularly disruptive, especially early in the year.'' Thus,
industry only grew 1.5 percent and the civilian machine-building
sector didn't grow at all.
   ``The real loser in 1987 appeared to be the consumer, who _ now
three years into Gorbachev's economic program _ has seen almost no
increase in his standard of living,'' the study said.
   It also said that for a variety of reasons, ``the short-term
outlook for Gorbachev's economic program is not good.''
   Among those reasons are confusion about guidelines for
self-financing reforms, deficiencies in 1987 machine-building that
will slow the speed of modernization, transportation problems, and
poor prospects for improved worker productivity.
   Gorbachev also needs to be better organized, the study concluded.
   ``Although Gorbachev's program is comprehensive, it is in some
respects inconsistent, particularly with regard to timing. For
example, his goals for an immediate acceleration in the growth of
national income and a pronounced improvement in the quality of
output are, in our view, fundamentally incompatible.''
   In addition, ``his plan to change traditional economic planning
and administrative procedures dramatically has been thrust upon a
largely unprepared bureaucracy,'' the study said.

   Demonstrators threw a firebomb at a
governing party candidate and two dozen people were arrested
Sunday. Politicians made last-minute appeals for support in
Tuesday's legislative elections.
   The nation's 130,000-member National Police force went on full
alert in a routine move to provide security Sunday, the 18th and
final day of official campaigning for the National Assembly
elections.
   The balloting is the first test of public confidence in the
government of President Roh Tae-woo since he was inaugurated on
Feb. 25, after his win in December's presidential vote.
   About 200 people who left an opposition rally held a sit-in at
Myungdong Cathedral in downtown Seoul where they shouted, ``Down
with Roh Tae-woo.''
   The protesters marched in the streets after dark, prompting
police to use tear gas. About 20 people were taken away by police.
   In the southeastern city of Taegu, police arrested four students
for hurling a firebomb at a government party candidate who was
making a speech during a joint rally.
   Even before the police alert went into effect, officers were
deployed in force throughout the country to minimize violence at
campaign rallies. Scattered incidents marred some rallies in recent
days.
   Police said 147 people had been booked so far for violating
election laws. Of those detained, only 12 were put under formal
arrest, and the rest were set free, they said.
   At stake in Tuesday's elections are 299 seats, 244 of which are
decided by popular vote, with the remaining 75 seats allocated to
parties in proportion to the total popular vote they receive.
   After the opposition split and lost the presidential vote,
opposition parties are struggling to make a strong comeback in the
legislative elections. Their efforts are hampered by internal
divisions.
   All election surveys by local newspapers indicated President
Roh's Democratic Justice Party would easily win a majority in the
assembly.
   ``We aim only for 55 percent of the seats,'' party chairman Chae
Moon-shik told reporters, denying predictions the governing party
would sweep the elections.
   Opposition parties rejected Chae's statement as a smoke screen,
accusing the government of planning to rig the elections and win at
least two-thirds of the seats.
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said in Seoul that the Roh
government would face ``catastrophic public resistance'' if it
tries to win the elections through fraud.
   ``I have clear evidence that the government is planning to buy
off votes with all sorts of illegal means, including cash,'' Kim
told 100,000 people who gathered at the three-hour rally at Yoido
Plaza.
   In the southern port of Pusan, the nation's second largest city,
another opposition leader, Kim Young-sam, sharpened his criticism
of the government, also charging fraud.
   ``If the DJP emerges as a big party through fraud, the Roh
government will be doomed and our politics will once again plunge
into chaos,'' Kim Young-sam told reporters.
   Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung have come under fire since they
divided the opposition vote in the December presidential election.
Roh won only a 36.6 percent plurality.

<HEAD>Israel, U.S. Company Push For Export Permit For Air-Launched Bomb</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   United Technologies Corp. and the government
of Israel are quietly lobbying the State Department for an export
permit that would allow the defense contractor to help Israel
design an air-launched, armor-seeking weapon system.
   U.S. officials so far have refused to issue the company the
necessary license, saying that the system would violate a six-year
ban on the sale of ``cluster bomb'' technology to Israel.
   The company's lobbying effort is outlined in a Feb. 4 memo from
United Technologies to Edward Derwinski, under secretary of state
for security assistance, science and technology. Defense Week, a
Washington publication, reports in its issue dated Monday that top
Israeli officials also have been lobbying for the UTC license.
   In the memo from C.R. Bergwin, director of export license
administration for Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies, the
company argues that the ban should not apply to the $50 million
contract.
   ``In order that we may proceed with the program, we urgently
require an interpretation that the U.S. government's cluster
munition policy does not apply to our contract,'' Bergwin wrote.
   He said the company believes that the 1982 ban was aimed at
cluster bombs designed to be used against people, not against tanks
and armored vehicles.
   Bergwin also argued that the United Technologies contract should
not be subject to the ban because ``our limited engineering
participation in this program'' has nothing to do with the warhead
portion of the system.
   Israel hired the company to design the nose, wing and control
modules of the weapon system. The contract was under UTC's Norden
Systems in Norwalk, Conn., but has been transferred to the
corporation's Advanced Systems Division in San Diego, a source told
The Associated Press.
   The White House imposed the cluster bomb ban on Israel in 1982
after evidence surfaced that the devices were used by Israel
against civilians during its invasion of Lebanon, an apparent
violation of assurances Israel had previously given U.S. officials.
   But Israeli officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
told Defense Week that the proposed weapon was much different from
a traditional cluster bomb.
   Conventional cluster bombs spread scores of ``bomblets''
indiscriminately, while the weapon under development would dispense
no more than 10 submunitions that would seek out individual armor
targets such as tanks, they said.
   But tank-seeking weapons that miss their primary target ``don't
turn into potted plants,'' one Pentagon official told Defense Week.
``They sense large metal objects like school buses and can cause
civilian casualties.''
   The newsletter said U.S. officials likely would approve the
export permit if Israel signs a proposal submitted two years ago by
the State Department that would detail how Israel could use such
weapons. But Israel does not want to sign the agreement.
   A State Department spokeswoman reached over the weekend declined
comment.
   United Technologies said in a prepared statement: ``It's a
classified Israeli program, and therefore we cannot comment.''

   Sloppy repairs, drunkenness and nepotism are
rampant at the Chernobyl nuclear plant two years after the world's
worst nuclear disaster, Pravda said Sunday.
   The Communist Party daily said engineering jobs at the plant
were handed out to medics, teachers, veterinarians and people
without any higher education.
   It also accused Chernobyl's managers of trying to ``resolve at
any cost'' obstacles to full electricity production at the plant
``to the detriment of the quality of repair and maintenance of
extremely intricate equipment.''
   The scathing attack was a departure from the numerous articles
appearing in the Soviet press before Tuesday's anniversary of the
April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the power plant 80 miles
north of the Ukrainian capital of Kiev.
   The explosion killed 31 people, spewed radiation around the
world and forced the evacuation of 135,000 Soviets living near the
plant.
   The previous stories have stressed the extensive safety
equipment installed at the plant, improved worker training, the
decrease to safe levels of radiation and the return of people to
surrounding areas.
   Pravda began by reporting safe radiation levels at the plant and
the production of 21 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity there
since the accident.
   But then the focus turned to criticism by the Kiev region's
Communist Party committee of ``Kombinat,'' the organization
supervising the plant and cleanup around it.
   Plant equipment was repaired without technical supervisors and
was not tested before being put into service despite serious
defects, the newspaper said. It said other problems caused ``the
grossest violations of sanitary standards.''
   Some safety measures planned on the reactor No. 4 at the plant
were not carried out because of Kombinat's negligence, Pravda said.
That reactor, in which the explosion occurred, has been sealed in
concrete laden with radiation sensors. Other official reports have
stressed the danger from the No. 4 reactor has been neutralized.
   ``Leadership posts were given to people who had criminal
records, who had been excluded from the party or had received
strict party penalties,'' Pravda said.
   ``Units were headed by people not able to cope with the business
they were entrusted with: medics, teachers, veterinarians and
people not having any higher education were working in engineering
posts,'' Pravda said.
   Discipline was slack, the newspaper said.
   ``In the `Kombinat' amalgamation, drunkenness, thievery and
violations of labor discipline have not been reduced,'' it said.
   Pravda did not say whether any corrective action had been taken,
other than to report that Kiev party leaders reprimanded Kombinat's
head, and indicated he had been fired.
   ``E. Ignatenko displayed liberalism and political immaturity in
the evaluation of the lack of discipline: multiple violations of
organizational and financial discipline, protectionism, nepotism,
moral breakdown of leaders,'' the paper said.
   The party leaders also reprimanded the Chernobyl plant's
director.
   ``Judging from all this, the leadership of Kombinat has not
learned a lesson from the past,'' Pravda said. ``It's as though
there hasn't been an accident.''
   The article indicated that managers tolerated the shortcomings
because of a widespread problem in Soviet industry: pressure to
fulfill a production plan.
   The government has said it must increase the production of
nuclear power plants to meet the country's electricity needs. The
Chernobyl plant, with two of its four reactors now operating, has
been ordered to generate 19.9 billion kilowatt-hours this year.
   Hints of problems at the plant first came in December. V.
Lukyanenko, the Communist Party head in Slavutich, a new town for
plant workers near Chernobyl, told a newspaper that sloppy work,
poor discipline and safety violations at the plant contributed to
36 accidents over a 10-month period, three of them fatal.
   Yuri K. Semyonov, deputy head of the Chernobyl cleanup
commission, denied at a Moscow news conference Wednesday that any
major accident or deaths occurred at the plant since the 1986
explosion.

   Evangelist Billy Graham preached to
nearly 5,000 Christians who packed three churches in this sprawling
port city Sunday and said religion can help the communist
government's modernization policy.
   ``It seems that China's leaders are talking about moral and
spiritual renewal,'' Graham told about 100 Shanghai pastors and
church leaders, speaking through a translator at All Saint's Church.
   ``Even secular leaders are asking the question, `Where are we to
find the moral renewal we need to be successful in China's
modernization program?' '' said the Southern Baptist minister.
``Could they turn to us?''
   The 69-year-old Southern Baptist minister, who seemed somewhat
guarded when he preached in Beijing last week for the first time in
China, held nothing back in his sermon to the pastors of all 23
Shanghai Protestant churches. Several Catholic priests and nuns
also attended.
   ``Be a spirit-filled minister,'' he thundered. ``Know something
about the (Holy) Spirit in your life.''
   Speaking of a spiritual renewal in China, he told them: ``God
may be doing things in your country you're not even aware of. I see
evidence of it everywhere, and it gladdens my heart.''
   Shanghai, China's biggest city with more than 6.3 million
people, has about 60,000 Protestants. About 4 million people
nationwide belong to the non-denominational Protestant church
sanctioned by the government.
   China has about 3 million Catholics who belong to the official
China Catholic Patriotic Association, which does not recognize the
authority of the Vatican.
   Millions more Protestants and Catholics are believed to pray
privately in their homes.
   Earlier Sunday, Graham urged more than 3,000 Christians at the
city's largest Protestant church to let their faith show in their
daily lives.
   ``Let people see that you're different,'' said Graham, speaking
through a translator at Mu-en Church, more than 100 years old.
   The mostly elderly congregation listened attentively, some
nodding at times in agreement. One elderly man sitting in the
balcony held up a sign with a bright red cross and ``God loves the
world'' written in Chinese.
   ``You are known and prayed for throughout the world,'' said
Graham, who has preached in nearly 70 countries. He arrived in
China on April 12 for a 16-day tour.
   The Pure Heart Church also was filled to overflowing with about
1,500 people when Graham spoke there Sunday evening.
   About 50 people sat on stone benches in the church courtyard and
listened to loudspeakers that broadcast Graham's sermon, which
discussed the ways Jesus Christ described himself to his followers.
   The Mu-en Church was built by Methodists in 1887. However,
Protestant denominations no longer exist in China, all having been
united under the official China Christian Council.
   Like all other churches and religious institutions in China, it
was closed during the radical leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution,
when all religious activity was banned. The Mu-en Church was
reopened in 1979, and its two Sunday morning services regularly
attract a total of about 3,000 worshipers.

   The owner of a glass shop knew a
woman wanted a new windshield for her black Mercedes-Benz, so when
he saw one parked in front of his store with keys in the ignition
he had his son drive it inside.
   After all, how many Mercedes would you expect to find in this
Missouri River town of around 7,000 people?
   ``Who would park two Mercedes in the same spot at the same
time?'' asked Bob Brown, owner of Brown Glass Shop. He and his son,
Ron, went out for lunch.
   Meanwhile, retired judge George Stanley emerged from Pete's Seed
& Feed across the street and noticed his black 280 SEL
Mercedes-Benz was missing. He reported it stolen.
   Then, with the Browns at lunch, the judge with no car and the
police looking for a hot Mercedez, up drives the woman who wanted a
new windshield.
   When the Browns returned from lunch, a police officer was
looking at the Mercedes-Benz the woman had parked in front of the
shop, Ron Brown said Friday.
   ``He asked us if we saw who had parked this car here,'' Brown
said. He answered, ``No, but we got one parked in back.''

   He wasn't exactly whistling while he
worked, but Daniel Bell whistled up a storm to win first prize at
the 15th annual National Whistlers Convention.
   ``I felt very good, but I knew that the competition was going to
be pretty keen,'' Bell, who placed second in 1986, said after
Saturday's final round. ``But I was pretty confident.''
   Bell, 68, of Sunnyvale, Calif., said he has been whistling since
he was a child, but didn't become involved in contests until his
wife entered him in one.
   ``My wife got me into these contests. She said I was the best
whistler she had ever heard,'' he said. ``She entered me in my
first competition without my knowledge.''
   Bell said he had been practicing since last year, and he wasn't
working on some easy pop tune. He won his title with ``Begin the
Beguine'' in the contemporary category and a selection from
``Samson and Delilah'' in the classical category.
   More than 3,000 contestants from 21 states tried out for the
convention, which began Monday, said Allen de Hart, the

   For parents faced with a children's birthday party
who'd rather that someone else cope with the invitations,

just the ticket.
   Earth Base Alpha is a unique party service in the corner of a

arrangements and orchestrates a party based on a space theme. It
even has a flight simulator and a simulated space walk.
   Eyes roll when the crew members announce everyone has to follow
the rules.

shy,'' said Roger Chang, the creative force behind Earth Base Alpha.
   After initial quiet, the rest of the 2{-hour party is punctuated
with deafening cheers and roars.
   ``These were quiet kids five minutes ago,'' Chang shouted over
the din at one recent party. ``Remember how quiet they were?''
   Chang, a father of two, and Jose Delgado, president of Earth
Base Alpha's holding company, August National Corp., thought the
business was reasonable for the paying parent.
   However, ``Roger did not figure Earth Base Alpha to be the
success that it has been,'' Delgado said.
   About 19,000 children ranging in age from 5 to 11 have gone into
orbit in 13 months, and the company is considering new outlets. The
base has been operating only on weekends but goes every day
starting this month.
   ``The more I hang around here, the less I like kids. We call
them PAs. It stands for party animals. It's a wild place,'' Chang
said. ``You want to have no kids after this.''

   An unauthorized Jeane Kirkpatrick for Vice
President campaign has garnered $100,000 and 1,400 volunteers in
less than four months, but is unlikely to win a blessing from the
former U.N. ambassador herself.
   The independent draft movement was the brainchild of Curt
Clinkscales, founder of a controversial senior citizens lobbying
group, owner of a direct mail firm and director of the Kirkpatrick
effort.
   Since January he and other Kirkpatrick aficionados have been
testing the grass roots through direct mailings and petitions
circulated at state Republican conventions.
   ``We have found that she is enormously popular. It's just been
incredible,'' Clinkscales said. ``This will show the vice president
(George Bush) that the ideal selection is Jeane Kirkpatrick.''
   Kirkpatrick, a Georgetown University professor and a fellow at
the American Enterprise Institute, declined to be interviewed on
the subject. But she said through a spokesman that she has no
connection with the Clinkscales effort and does not want one.
   ``She believes the decision on the vice president should be
solely that of Vice President Bush,'' the expected GOP nominee,
said Mark Salter, the spokesman.
   Clinkscales, a direct mail expert and former member of the
executive committee of the National Conservative Political Action
Committee, doesn't disagree with that. But he says he's hoping to
create such a groundswell for Kirkpatrick that Bush won't dare
choose anyone else.
   ``Frankly, without this effort, I don't think Dr. Kirkpatrick
would be given serious consideration for the nomination,'' he said.
``With it, I think she will get it.''
   Bush spokesman Pete Teeley predicted that the Clinkscales
initiative would not be the first lobbying effort on behalf of one
vice presidential possibility or another.
   ``Mrs. Kirkpatrick is wise in not becoming involved in this
operation and she is correct in her statement that it is the vice
president's choice. He will make that after a lot of
consideration,'' Teeley said.
   ``These efforts are sometimes embarrassing to the people that
they're allegedly designed to help,'' he added. ``There's just
something really unseemly about trying to force somebody onto a
ticket... to throw them forward in an effort they haven't
sanctioned themselves.''
   In his letter to potential contributors, Clinkscales wrote that
Kirkpatrick's ``widespread popular support convinced many party
officials to begin this independent draft effort. I agreed to serve
as campaign director to help make 1988 a milestone year for freedom
everywhere.''
   However, asked in an interview whose idea it was to start a
draft-Kirkpatrick campaign, Clinkscales replied, ``It was mine.''
   He said his company, CLCO Inc., has sent out 400,000 letters in
weekly waves that started last Jan. 28.
   Clinkscales said his suppliers are making money from the
campaign but he and his company are not. He said the effort is
self-sustaining, supported by donations from the people who get the
letters.
   In addition to running CLCO, Clinkscales is national director of
the arch-conservative National Alliance of Senior Citizens, which
he founded in 1974.
   The group has opposed Medicare expansions, including the
catastrophic health insurance bill pending in Congress, and
supported candidates who favor freezing Social Security
cost-of-living adjustments. It compiles a congressional ratings
list based on diverse issues and has consistently rated at zero or
close to it Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., usually considered a
champion of elderly causes.
   In 1986 the alliance was involved in a controversy when it sent
out more than 100,000 letters to U.S. physicians and pharmacists
defending a popular arthritis drug called Feldene, which was under
attack by Ralph Nader's Health Research Group. The letter made no
mention of it, but the mailing was paid for by the drug's
manufacturer, Pfizer Inc., a corporate sponsor of the alliance.

   Former first lady Rosalynn Carter has
joined the debate over the filming of the movie ``Union Street''
here.
   Local veterans organizations have criticized the movie's star,
actress Jane Fonda, because of her visit to North Vietnam during
the Vietnam War, and say she is not welcome in town.
   In a letter that was published in Friday's editions of the
Waterbury Republican-American, Mrs. Carter said Fonda was not alone
in strongly objecting to the Vietnam War.
   ``It is true Fonda was a militant objector during the Vietnam
War and did things of which I strongly disapproved,'' Mrs. Carter
said. ``However, it is good for us to realize that millions of
Americans, young and old, strongly opposed some of the actions of
our government during the conflict.''
   Mrs. Carter said Fonda has since expressed regrets about the
methods she used to oppose the war and has supported the cause of
Vietnam veterans.
   ``Ours is a nation whose principles permit us citizens to
express differences of opinion _ even to criticize publicly our own
government,'' Mrs. Carter said. ``My hope is that those who still
condemn Fonda and would deprive her of the right to practice her
profession are a small minority and that other citizens of
Waterbury will speak up for the right of free speech in our
country.''

   Watergate conspirator-turned-minister Jeb
Stuart Magruder says immorality that once was frowned on in this
country has become the norm.
   ``In the first 200 years after the founding of this country,
unethical behavior existed, but it was not tolerated,'' Magruder
said as he opened a panel discussion on ethics Saturday. ``But
today I'm afraid, unethical behavior is part of the norm ... it is
expected.''
   Magruder cited an episode of ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in which
young women spoke about their lives as ``groupies,'' fans who are
obsessed with rock stars. One woman claimed to have had sex with
about 2,000 musicians, he said.
   The woman appeared to be proud of her liaisons and ``obviously
it was of interest to the public because it was on national
television,'' he said.
   Magruder, a Presbyterian minister here, spent seven months in
jail for his role as a Nixon administration staffer in the
Watergate affair, which he calls one of the greatest ethical
scandals of modern times.
   Since he was ordained a minister in 1981, he has divided his
time between church duties and speaking to groups about ethics.
Last month, he was appointed head of the city's 15-member
Commission on Values and Ethics.

   Ted Turner, president of Atlanta-based
Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., says he is convinced man will
eventually destroy both himself and the environment.
   Nonetheless, he praised Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for his
disarmament efforts, saying they are a sign that peace and
stability are still achievable.
   Speaking here Saturday at a peace conference, Turner said he has
been a peace activist ``passionately'' for the past 10 years.
   Man has been fighting himself and the planet since time began,
and both wars have accelerated in the last hundred years, Turner
said.
   ``The war against each other is going pretty well,'' he said.
``But the war against the environment, we're winning that hands
down. A tree doesn't have much chance against a man with a
chainsaw.''
   In a wide-ranging talk to about 150 people at the Robert Muller
School, Turner said that next to nuclear war, overpopulation and
depletion of natural resources are the world's most pressing
problems.
   Turner was critical of the Reagan administration, saying Ronald
Reagan would have been a good president 100 years ago, ``when we
had machine guns and the other guys just had spears.''

   Borrowing the line from a song, ``get
your kicks on Route 66,'' Will Rogers Jr. kissed the governor of
Arizona at a dedication of the celebrated east-west link as a
national historic highway.
   Hundreds showed up Saturday from as far away as New York and
Detroit, including Gov. Rose Mofford and dozens of people driving
their vintage, mid-1950s cars. The celebrants hoped to call
attention to the route that was the main link between Chicago and
Los Angles until Interstate 40 made the heyday of Route 66 little
more than a memory.
   ``If you want to make history today,'' Mrs. Mofford told Rogers,
``you can kiss the governor. It'll be the only governor you ever
kissed.''
   And Rogers, son of the Depression-era humorist, obliged.
   Mrs. Mofford joined in a group singing of Bobby Troup's ``Route
66,'' even though she admitted that she didn't know all of the
words and ``I can't carry a tune, even in the shower.''
   Residents of Seligman hoped that designation of Route 66 as a
national historic highway would help breathe some life into the
tiny towns lining the route across northern Arizona _ towns that
have seen hard times since they were bypassed.

<HEAD>Dukakis and Jackson: Rivals and Friends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They are an odd couple _ the cool technocrat
from Massachusetts and the fiery preacher from the civil rights
movement. Rivals they still are, but Michael Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson have become friends as they have survived to the endgame of
the Democratic nomination wars of 1988.
   ``We like each other and we respect each other,'' Dukakis tells
crowds. ``We may differ on some issues, but if we do, it is in the
spirit of friendship.''
   Politicians often say they like each other or are friends when
there is little there but political necessity and practical
relationships. But aides to both candidates say the Dukakis-Jackson
relationship is getting stronger and more personal day by day.
   It is a relationship nutured in private talks and public
positions. The two meet on the campaign trail, most often at
debates.
   This weekend, in debates in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, there
was much laughter and smiling and banter as they talked of their
agreement on the issues and little about their disagreements.
   ``It's been growing and it is very positive,'' said Ann Lewis, a
Jackson adviser, of the developing relationship between the two
candidates. Lewis said the two-week New York battle was a key to
the friendship, as both men avoided negative campaigning.
   The two also talk by phone at least once a week _ the loser
calling to congratulate the winner Wednesday morning after each
primary.
   ``They've been through the same grueling experience together _
this campaign,'' added Dukakis aide Leslie Dach. ``That's gives
them a lot in common.''
   In the next few weeks and months, their relationship may be the
single most important one for the party and its hopes for winning
back the White House in November.
   Dukakis is the front-runner with a growing lead: Jackson, the
black leader who excites crowds like no other politician today.
   How Dukakis deals with Jackson and his supporters will determine
in large part their commitment to the Democratic ticket in the fall.
   ``How do we channel the enthusiasm in that community?'' Rep. Jim
Florio, D-N.J., asked Dukakis at one Philadelphia campaign stop as
they talked of the fall campaign.
   Thus, the Dukakis aversion to negative campaigns and his need
for Jackson's help dovetail nicely.
   ``Yes, I want to win, but this is going to be a positive
campaign,'' Dukakis said in Aliquippa, Pa.
   ``We both happen to be very positive people,'' Dukakis told a
labor rally Saturday morning in Philadelphia. ``We both understand
that there is one overriding goal in this campaign and that is to
win in November.''
   Dukakis' dealings with Jackson will shape many voters'
perception of what kind of a leader this Massachusetts governor
really is.
   In 1984, Democratic nominee Walter Mondale's failure to deal
effectively with Jackson in his first bid for the nomination helped
create the perception that Mondale was a weak leader who pandered
ineffectively to the key black voting bloc in the party.
   This year, there were reports that Dukakis and Jackson did not
get along particularly well, reports that both camps say were
exaggerated or wrong.
   The relationship improved after Super Tuesday, as Jackson was
gracious in his victory in Michigan and finishing ahead of Dukakis
in Illinois. Dukakis, in turn, was gracious in accepting defeat and
pushing on to the next state.
   Dukakis resisted all pressure to be sharply critical of Jackson,
even after Sen. Albert Gore Jr. went dramatically negative against
Jackson in a desparate effort to revive his candidacy in the two
weeks before the New York primary.
   And New York Mayor Ed Koch joined in, adding a racial and
religious overtone to the debate that brought Koch strong rebukes
from some.
   Dukakis and Jackson both refused to trade charges on that level,
tactics that they repeatedly praised each other for.
   Now the relationship will be truly tested, as the two go
head-to-head for the rest of the primary season and perhaps into
the convention.
   Dukakis is treading very, very carefully in his theme of
government experience as the reason to win voters' support. While
at times his stance of ``I'm a doer, not a talker'' seemed aimed
directly at Jackson, he is careful now to praise Jackson even as he
draws the distinctions.
   ``Jesse has his own strengths and his own message and it's an
important one,'' Dukakis said. ``What I offer is a record of
helping to create jobs, to save jobs...of building housing, and
providing health care.''
   Asked if that meant Jackson doesn't have a record, Dukakis
insisted he didn't mean that.
   ``He doesn't have a record in government. I do. He has his other
strengths. I respect them and I admire them,'' he said.

   Pro-Iranian extremists said Sunday they
will kill two American hostages and may attack inside the United
States if U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf launch new attacks on
Iran.
   The statement came hours after an Iranian gunboat attacked a
Saudi Arabian tanker in the gulf, despite a warning by President
Reagan that Iran faced ``very costly'' consequences if it continued
hitting neutral ships and other targets.
   The extremists made their latest threat in a handwritten
statement signed by the Revolutionary Justice Organization, a
Shiite Moslem group, and delivered to The Associated Press and the
French news agency Agence France-Presse.
   The group holds Joseph Cicippio, 57, of Valley Forge, Pa., and
Edward Tracy, 57, of Burlington, Vt.
   ``Any new (U.S.) aggression under any pretext or excuse will
lead to the execution of spy Edward Tracy first and Cicippio
secondly,'' the statement announced.
   Tracy, a writer of children's books, was kidnapped Oct. 21,
1986. Cicippio, acting comptroller at the American University of
Beirut, was kidnapped from campus earlier that year on Sept. 12.
   Cicippio and Tracy are among nine Americans and 13 other
foreigners held hostage by various groups in Lebanon. The longest
held is 40-year-old Terry A. Anderson, of Lorain, Ohio, the chief
Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Both copies of Sunday's statement were accompanied by
photocopies of a Lebanese group's membership card bearing Tracy's
photograph. However, the organization is not named on the card, and
it was not clear if it was authentic.
   Last Monday, U.S. warships disabled two Iranian frigates and
sank or disabled four other armed Iranian vessels in the gulf.
Tehran said 44 Iranians were killed.
   ``The attacks occurring in the gulf will not go unpunished and
will not be as easy as America assumes,'' the statement said. ``Our
logical answer to the invasion of the region ... brings us to the
option of moving the battle arena to inside America, after which
things will get out of control.''
   In another development, Beirut's conservative Ad-Diyar daily
newspaper reported Sunday that a deal to free three French hostages
held by another Shiite faction fell apart because of developments
in the hijacking of a Kuwaiti airliner. The report said the captors
reneged on pledges to release the French hostages because the
hijackers were still in Algiers, Algeria.
   Arab officials said that when the Algerians negotiated an end to
the 16-day hijacking Wednesday, the Shiite sky pirates abandoned
the plane for guaranteed safe conduct to another country. But
Ad-Diyar, without citing sources, challenged earlier reports that
the hijackers had left Algiers and gone to either Iran or Lebanon.
   Sunday's threat was the second issued by Revolutionary Justice
in less than a week. The group said in a similar handwritten
Arabic-language statement Tuesday that there would be
``retaliations and retaliations'' for U.S. military action in the
gulf.
   The earlier statement was accompanied by a Polaroid photograph
of Cicippio.
   In Sunday's statement, the extremists described U.S. naval
presence in the gulf as a ``mean challenge to the free nations of
the world.''
   The fighting in the gulf last Monday flared after U.S. warships
blasted two offshore Iranian oil platforms in what Washington
termed a ``measured response'' to the mining of a U.S. frigate
April 14.

   A man who set his gasoline-soaked clothes on
fire and walked down the aisle of a church during a prayer service
died Sunday from his burns, though worshippers tried to save him by
dousing the flames.
   The songs of a children's choir gave way to hysterical screams
as worshippers at Friendship Baptist Church noticed Willie J.
Boone, 41.
   Saturday night's musical program was almost over when ``I saw
the children looking curious and I looked back'' from the first
row, said the Rev. Jimmy L. Mills. ``I saw this young man coming up
the middle aisle ablaze of fire.''
   ``Most of (the children) went into hysterics,'' he said. ``It
was a terrible tragedy.''
   The pastor said he and deacons used a fire extinguisher to douse
the flames on the man's clothes ``and asked him to go out and sit
on the front porch and that's where he went until the police
arrived.''
   On the porch, Boone said, ``It's all right,'' and collapsed,
Mills said.
   Boone suffered burns over his entire body except the soles of
his feet, said patient representative Karen Hall at the Medical
Center of Central Georgia.
   Mills, pastor of the downtown Macon church for 30 years, said
Boone gave no clue to his motive and was a stranger to the 40 to 50
people in the church sanctuary.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania's Confused Delegate Selection Process Is Under Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Pennsylvania voters prepare to cast
ballots in Tuesday's primary, there is growing criticism of the
state's unusual delegate-selection system.
   Voters must choose from 300 largely obscure delegate candidates
_ without knowing the contenders' presidential preferences.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., has called for changing the system.
And Elsie Hillman, who heads George Bush's Pennsylvania operation,
said not listing prospective delegates' loyalties is ``absolutely
silly, ridiculous.''
   With so many unknown delegate contenders running for a spot at
the national convention, the Republican system places a premium on
ballot position _ so much so that at least one congressman running
for delegate believes he may lose because voters won't see his name.
   ``I'm running for delegate, but I'm like 17th out of 18 people
(on the ballot),'' said Rep. Don Ritter of Lehigh County. ``I
suspect that most people won't get to my name, so it would not be
at all surprising to finish very poorly.''
   Another delegate candidate, Leonard Falcone of Wyoming, Pa.,
called the list of names ``a spaghetti pile'' and said there are so
many names in his 11th Congressional District that ``voters
actually have to get down on their knees in the balloting box to
get to where the delegates are, and I'm last.''
   Said Hillman: ``It's going to be a screwy ballot.''
   Pennsylvania will send 96 delegates to the GOP convention in
August. Eighteen of those, including Specter, have already been
picked by the Republican State Committee.
   The rest will be elected Tuesday. The ballot includes a handful
of congressmen, a former congressman, and dozens of local elected
officials. It also includes many candidates making their first run
at any office above the city level.
   ``I just wanted to get more involved in the political process,''
said contender Frank Romeo Jr., vice president of a family-owned
food distribution firm in Uniontown. ``I'm a committeemen, but I've
never tried to run for anything else.''
   Romeo drew poor ballot position _ seventh among seven candidates
vying for three spots in the 22nd Congressional District. Each of
the state's 23 districts automatically get three delegates, and
some get more based on a complicated formula that considers their
support for Ronald Reagan in 1984, among other factors.
   Republican State Committee Chairman Earl Baker said
Pennsylvania's system evolved out of a desire to give the state
more clout at the convention by holding back committing delegates
to particular candidates.
   Baker said in an interview that the method encourages grassroots
involvement. If delegates' preferences appeared on the ballot, then
``you would take out the local aspect and have a fight between
tickets,'' he said.
   Pennsylvania's GOP delegate rules are set by the Republican
State Committee, and Baker said he saw no reason to change.
   But Specter said voters ``are entitled to have commitments.
Otherwise, you don't have the will of the people expressed.''
   ``It's anti-democratic, with a small `D' and a big `D,' '' said
Jon Delano, press secretary to Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa. He said he
preferred the Pennsylvania Democrats' system of listing delegates
on the ballot according to presidential preference or as
``uncommitted.''
   Bush is expected to win the lion's share of GOP delegates,
mostly because his workers aggressively recruited well-known local
figures to run. Also, the Bush camp recently mailed 300,000 slate
cards to Republican voters listing which delegates back the vice
president.
   But supporters of Pat Robertson drew the top ballot position in
12 districts.
   Of course, Pennsylvania Republicans will also cast their ballots
for Bush or Robertson. But that ``beauty contest'' portion of the
election has no bearing on delegates.

   Bishop Cyril M. Wismar had prayed much of
his life for a united Lutheran Church, and when his prayers were
answered, he was left unemployed.
   Wismar, 69, is one of several hundred bishops, clergy members
and lay church employees who lost their jobs when three Lutheran
branches merged Jan. 1 into the 5.3 million-member Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America.
   Wismar had served for nearly 12 years as the New England bishop
of the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, the smallest
of the denominations.
   His main goal now is to develop a ministry for other members of
the clergy who are retired or alone.
   ``I don't feel sorry for myself. I feel sorry for many, many
people. You have to realize that out there there are, I guess,
literally thousands of people who are no longer serving in the
roles in which they served in their former church affiliation,''
Wismar said in a recent interview at his home here.
   ``For a while your telephone rings a lot, and people call you a
lot, and you're running around a lot to parishes and assisting
pastors and people and then suddenly you're not,'' Wismar said.
   ``For almost 12 years I've been doing that and so very suddenly
you come to a screeching halt, and you want to do something,'' he
said.
   It's hard to think of the retired bishop doing nothing. Besides
helping out at a local church, he regularly visits patients in
hospitals and convalescent homes, administers communion to
shut-ins, hosts a half-hour local radio program every Sunday and
does a daily religious news update. He also serves on the Falls
Village Board of Education, the Housatonic Valley Regional High
School board, and the town and regional housing commissions.
   But for those with less to do, Wismar is petitioning the new
church to endorse his visitation program for retired clergy
members. He is asking parishes and private foundations to donate
the $12,000 to $13,000 a year to pay him a stipend, transportation
and communication costs.
   The new denomination was created by the merger of the Lutheran
Church in America, the American Lutheran Church, and the
Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.
   Bishop Herbert Chilstrom, head of the new church, said church
planners decided all applicants for positions in the new church
would be treated equally, regardless of whether they held offices
in the past.
   In the Lutheran church, people are chosen for posts by secret
ballots of congregations.
   ``Everyone lost their position, because in the Lutheran church,
you are not a bishop for life,'' Chilstrom said in a telephone
interview from the church's Chicago headquarters. ``No one who was
a bishop had any guarantee he would continue in the church.''
   Of those like Wismar, Chilstrom said: ``It's a very tricky thing
to say that these people in all cases were simply turned out. What
I can say in general is because of the merger on a churchwide
level, we were reduced by several hundred people.''
   Wismar is pushing his plan because, ``as bishop, I noted that
the people who are the most forgotten and neglected people in the
church are the retired clergy and widows of retired clergy. So I
have devised a scheme for visitation of these people to find out
what their needs are.''

<HEAD>Defense Mounts Desperate Effort To Block Death Penalty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   John Demjanjuk's defense team has mounted a
desperate effort to block a death sentence for the retired Ohio
autoworker convicted of being a brutal Nazi death camp guard.
   But the death penalty is expected Monday from the three Israeli
judges who pronounced Demjanjuk guilty last week in a sweeping
verdict that rejected all defense arguments.
   Only one man has ever been executed in Israel's 40-year history.
Adolf Eichmann, the architect of the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's
``Final Solution'' against Jews, was convicted and hanged in 1962.
   Demjanjuk's attorneys say their only goal at Monday's hearing
will be to save their client's life. Attorney John Gill of
Cleveland said the defense and Demjanjuk's family are convinced
evidence will eventually emerge clearing his client.
   ``But if the judges impose the `final solution' on John, they
won't be able to bring him back when it becomes clear it was all a
mistake,'' the defense attorney said.
   In their 450-page judgment, the tribunal convicted Demjanjuk
``without hesitation or doubt'' of being the guard ``Ivan the
Terrible'' and said he killed ``masses of human beings with his own
hands'' at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.
   Yossi Hassin, a government-appointed trial spokesman, said
Demjanjuk most likely will face execution.
   ``This verdict paved the way for a death sentence. I would be
very surprised if the judges gave Demjanjuk anything less than
death,'' he told The Associated Press.
   Demjanjuk's son said no matter what the defense argues, he and
other family members know what the sentence will be.
   ``After the ludicrously sweeping judgment, we don't expect
anything less than a death penalty,'' John Jr. said in an
interview. ``These are old-fashioned hanging judges.''
   Nazi war crimes and terrorism are the only offenses punishable
by death in the Jewish state, and Israel has never executed a
convicted terrorist.
   Justice Minister Avraham Sharir urged the death penalty for
Demjanjuk. ``A man convicted of such terrible crimes deserves no
other sentence,'' he said.
   Sharir has no authority over the state prosecutor who argues the
sentence Monday, but his statement reflects the sentiments of many
Israelis, including the nation's 80,000 Holocaust survivors.
   ``The death penalty is what this man deserves,'' said
French-born Dina Rosenbaum, 58, who lost most of her family in Nazi
death camps. ``I'm only sorry he lived so many years before being
brought to justice.''
   Throughout the 14-month trial, Demjanjuk maintained his
innocence and insisted he was a victim of mistaken identity.
   After the verdict, a somber-looking Demjanjuk shouted to
reporters as he was led away: ``I am an innocent man! This is
ridiculous what happened today!''
   Emerging from a visit with his father in prison, Demjanjuk's son
John Jr. said: ``My father says the only judge that counts is God.
God knows he's innocent.''
   Five death camp survivors identified Demjanjuk as Ivan,
including one who said he recognized the defendant's walk and
another who said he remembered Demjanjuk's ``murderous eyes.''
   At Monday's hearing, Gill said he would emphasize the
fallability of human memory and introduce 350 cases from as early
as 1963 in which people later found to be innocent were convicted
and sentenced to death.
   In 62 percent of the cases, the wrongful conviction was due to
mistaken identity, Gill said.
   But that argument has already been rejected by the judges, who
in their verdict gave great weight to the survivors' testimony and
praised their ``reliability ... and excellent memories.''
   Although a guilty verdict was expected, most longtime observers
were surprised by the judges' systematic rejection of all defense
evidence, including documents that contradicted the survivors'
testimony.
   The judges dismissed discrepancies between survivors who
contended Demjanjuk was at Treblinka in 1942 and 1943, and a former
Nazi guard who said Demjanjuk was at the nearby Sobibor death camp
at the same time.
   Some Israelis believe the death penalty will be imposed but not
executed.
   ``People expect this court to hand down the death penalty and
the Supreme Court to reduce it to life imprisonment,'' said Gabriel
Bron of the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot. ``The feeling is the
Supreme Court will give greater weight to the doubts.''
   Trial spokesman Hassin agreed, saying the Supreme Court ``could
make a political decision to spare Demjanjuk. Here in Israel we
don't like to impose death, not even for terrorists.''
   But Demjanjuk's son-in-law Ed Nishnic, who raised $650,000 for
Demjanjuk's defense, said he doesn't expect clemency.
   ``The Israelis are killing Palestinians like they were open
game,'' Nishnic said, referring to Arabs killed during a five-month
uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``Israel is going to do with John whatever suits its purpose,''
he said. ``It doesn't care what the rest of the world thinks of its
judicial system.''

<HEAD>Lab Spill Leads To Trail Of Radioactivity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A laboratory spill that led investigators
on a trail of radioactive trash and contaminated several workers
before the danger was apparent is under investigation for possible
charges against the lab's owner, it was reported Sunday.
   The Marshall Diagnostics lab where the chemical spill occurred
has been closed since shortly after the February accident, and
state officials said they will seal the lab until September, when
the radioactive residues will be harmless.
   State health officials have tested the homes of lab workers and
found low levels of radioactivity on pant legs, shoes and other
clothing of six workers.
   The Boston Sunday Globe reported that the spill happened Feb. 4
when Louis W. Mead, a co-owner of the lab and a chemical engineer
for 42 years, was working with tungsten 178 _ a radioactive
material that could help detect heart and other medical problems.
   When he realized the following day that about two ounces of the
solution had spilled, he tried to scrub it clean with bleach and
water, then tossed the wet towels into the trash. A janitor, not
realizing the spill was radioactive, volunteered to finish cleaning
the lab over the weekend.
   The following Monday, Mead's son did some carpentry work at the
lab. He threw his trash _ and the contaminated rags _ into his
truck and took it to his parents' home in Lexington, where the
debris was put out the next Wednesday with the family's garbage.
   Garbagemen took the two contaminated bags, along with the rest
of their load, to the Resco incinerator in North Andover. When they
tried to unload, an alarm went off and caused Resco to refuse the
garbage.
   The radioactive wastes were taken to an old sanitary landfill in
Lexington. The next day, Lexington police, who had found an old
bill linking the trash to Mead, visited him at the lab, and he
accompanied them to the landfill.
   Mead collected the contaminated materials, which had leaked from
his garbage bags and now filled 10 plastic bags, and took them to
his lab. Two wheelbarrows of contaminated material were removed
five days later from the landfill after a snowstorm.
   Mead has given a detailed chronology of the spill and its spread
to state officials, who have supplemented the report with their own
investigation, the Globe said.
   ``We are going out of business,'' Mead told the newspaper. ``My
partner and I are going into retirement.''
   While officials expect any radioactive material in the lab to
decay, the remaining wastes have been shipped to a licensed storage
facility in Tinley Park, Ill.
   Robert Hallisey, chief of radiation safety at the state
Department of Public Health, said he is considering whether to
impose penalties or recommend prosecution against Mead and his
partner, Marshall Deutsch.
   Hallisey said he was pleased by Mead's cooperation, but still
could recommend penalties of up to $6,000.
   ``We need a strong state posture on handling radioactive
materials,'' Hallisey said. ``We intend to do that.''

   The nation's county governments spend just
over $426 per resident to provide services, led by the largest
counties, the Census Bureau reports.
   A survey of county governments released Sunday found spending by
counties averaged $426.22 per resident nationwide in the 1985-86
fiscal year.
   But counties with populations of 500,000 or more spent an
average of $503.99 per resident, the report found.
   By comparison, counties of fewer than 100,000 spent $383.12 per
resident.
   Seven counties spent more than $1,000 per resident providing
services, the Census Bureau noted. They are:
   _Montgomery County, Md., $1,684.
   _Fairfax County, Va., $1,648.
   _Baltimore County, Md., $1,298.
   _Prince Georges County, Md., $1,210.
   _Clark County, Nev., $1,041.
   _Dade County, Fla., $1,026.
   _Nassau County, N.Y., $1,020.
   Types of spending vary greatly from county to county. Education
is a small share of many county governments, yet provides as much
as half of the spending for the four with the largest per capita
expenditures, the study found.

   A cadre of officers has kept the peace
during this year's Chippewa Indian spearfishing season, the fourth
since federal courts upheld the Indians' right to harvest resources
on lands the tribes ceded to the government.
   Protests against the Indian fishing rights and their method of
taking large numbers of sport fish have been noisy and violent in
previous years, including shots fired at some lakes in 1986. No
serious injuries have been reported.
   An argument between an Indian and an non-Indian over a traffic
incident last week looked like it might turn into a scuffle, but
Iron County Sheriff Don Bungi quickly separated the two. When more
spectators arrived, he called for backup officers, bringing in more
than a dozen squad cars.
   The six-year veteran, who oversees a four-man department, has
become experienced in handling crowds during the controversial
off-reservation spearfishing season on lakes in northern Wisconsin.
   Protesters consider spearing an unfair way of bagging the
walleyed pike and muskies that are a prime tourism attraction for
sportsfishers.
   An early show of force by police marked this spearfishing
season, and protests seem to have moved off the boat landings and
onto the lakes.
   Each night before sunset, a National Guard helicopter passes
over the lakes. Police sometimes outnumber spectators. And new
signs announce that alcoholic beverages are prohibited on the
landings at night.
   Federal court rulings have upheld Chippewa rights, retained in
19th century treaties, to harvest resources _ including fishing,
hunting, trapping and harvesting wild rice _ off the reservations
on land the tribes ceded to the federal government.
   Each band is allowed 15 days of spearing. Spearers may take no
more than 20 percent of what biologists figure a lake's fish
population can tolerate. The season ends by May 6.
   The Indians fish at night, using lanterns to help them find the
fish, which they catch with spears up to eight feet in length.
   On Saturday night, 11th night of the season, 123 Chippewa
spearers took 3,088 fish despite cold weather and snow in some
places.
   Dave Daniel, a state Department of Natural Resources spokesman
at Woodruff, said there was no trouble at any site, although a
group of protesters did watch the Lac du Flambeau tribe spear at
Squirrel Lake in Vilas County.
   ``It was a very quiet last night,'' Daniels said. ``There were
probably 40 or 45 protesters that showed up on Squirrel Lake. But
they were peaceful and quiet and there to observe and that was it.''
   Some critics have said the police presence is too costly and
possibly unwarranted.
   ``The taxpayers have to pay for this,'' said Bill Schnautc of
Butternut, a spearfishing opponent.
   The state Division of Emergency Government estimated costs for
the first five days of the season at about $50,000, said Dave
Kunelius, a Natural Resources spokesman.
   Local police, who began planning security in December, organized
two backup units of 30 officers each from other areas in the state.
The backup units are stationed in northern Wisconsin during the
spearfishing season.
   At Butternut Lake _ the site last year of a protest that
required more than 150 officers to keep peace _ about 75 officers
were stationed on the boat landing before Indians or protesters
arrived this year.
   ``There's obviously some areas where we anticipated trouble,''
said George Meyer, chief administrator of law enforcement for the
Department of Natural Resources.
   This year's problems have been mainly complaints that
spearfishermen have been harassed by non-Indian boats creating
waves, shining lights and splashing water near them.
   Gatherings at boat landings have been smaller this year than
last, which authorities attribute partly to colder weather and
partly to more visible security.
   ``I think it's great. We're getting cooperation from both
sides,'' Bungi said Friday. ``I think everything's going smoothly.''
   Tom Maulson, a Lac du Flambeau tribal judge and spearfishing
organizer, applauded the police effort but said he wished it was
not needed.
   ``It's just unfortunate that we have a lot of people watching us
fish,'' he said. ``It's a shame that a few protesters have to cost
the state of Wisconsin so much money.''

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Arafat visiting Wazir's

   Palestine Liberation Organization chief
Yasser Arafat came to Damascus Sunday for the first time since he
was expelled five years ago. PLO officials said Arafat and Syria
would end their split.
   Arafat, his leadership beset by the April 16 assassination of
his deputy, Khalil Wazir, flew in from Libya and visited Wazir's
grave.
   Arafat's arrival in the Syrian capital capped a week-long
mediation effort by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi and Algerian
President Chadli Benjedid to heal the rift between the onetime
allies, PLO sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Arafat's key political aide, Farouk Kaddoumi, also been working
on the reconciliation, conducting negotiations in Damascus since
Tuesday.
   Arafat was accompanied by Salah Khalaf, who with Arafat and
Wazir founded the guerrilla's mainstream faction, Fatah. Lt. Col.
Mustafa Kharroubi, a chief aide to Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi, also was on the plane.
   Asked if he would meet with President Hafez Assad, Arafat said,
``God willing.''
   Arafat and Khalaf drove to the Martyrs' Cemetry in Damascus'
Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp to pay tribute to Wazir.
   Thousands of the camp's 220,000 refugees took to the streets to
welcome the Palestinian leader. ``Blood and souls we sacrifice for
you, Abu Ammar,'' they chanted, invoking Arafat's nom de guerre.
   The refugees surrounded Arafat's car and then lifted it off the
ground in an emotional demonstration of support.
   Arafat was expelled from Syria five years ago during a bloody
feud with Assad. He had been expected to surmount his disagreements
with Assad last week so he could fly to Damascus for Wazir's burial
last Wednesday, but that plan failed.
   At least one PLO official said the imminent reconciliation was
due to the death of Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad.
   ``The martyrdom of Abu Jihad certainly pushed the reconciliation
forward,'' Bassam Abu Sharif, Arafat's adviser, said in a telephone
interview from Tunis.
   ``Joining hands with our Syrian brothers is the response for
Israel's crime. Abu Jihad's blood is the bridge of unity for the
forces fighting the Zionist occupation of Arab land,'' he said.
   Indeed, Palestinian factions, divided since the PLO-Syrian rift,
all denounced Wazir's killing and vowed revenge. They called for
the reunification within the PLO and a reconciliation with Syria as
a response to Israel's apparent effort to weaken the movement.
   Israeli military sources have said Wazir, 52, was gunned down in
Tunisia by a commando unit in a raid planned by Israel's Mossad
intelligence agency. The Israeli government has not confirmed it.
   Arafat flew into Damascus airport amid tight security. He was
met at the plane by Interior Minister Mohammed Harba and Saeed
Hamadi, a member of the ruling Baath Party's regional command.
   There was little ceremony at the airport.
   Arafat is generally accorded a head-of-state welcome in Arab
countries, which regard the PLO as the sole representative of the
world's 5 million Palestinians. But the Syrian government reacted
cautiously to Arafat's first visit to Damascus since he was kicked
out June 24, 1983.
   The PLO and Syria have been inching toward a rapprochement since
Arafat cut off relations with Egypt in April 1987 and pro-Syrian
PLO factions made peace with Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of
the PLO.
   Syria, spearhead of Arab radicalism, has refused to make up with
Egypt until President Hosni Mubarak cancels the March 1979 peace
treaty that his predecessor, the late Anwar Sadat, signed with
Israel.
   Syria and Arafat are adamantly opposed to separate peace deals
with Israel.
   The Assad-Arafat feud erupted after Israel's invasion of Lebanon
in 1982 and the consequent evacuation of the PLO from its power
base in Beirut and south Lebanon.
   Arafat at that time began looking into the prospects of
negotiating peace with Israel.
   That angered Assad and PLO radicals, who advocate armed struggle
against Israel.
   In May 1983, the friction exploded into an all-out battle
between Arafat's supporters and Syrian-backed hardliners seeking to
oust the guerrilla chief from the PLO leadership.
   By December that year, the dissidents had overrun Arafat's bases
in east and north Lebanon, forcing him to abandon his last Lebanese
strongholds.
   By 1985, the PLO had slowly infiltrated back into Beirut and
south Lebanon.
   That prompted the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal movement in
Lebanon to attack Palestinian refugee camps.
   The so-called ``war of the camps'' ended only three months ago
as the PLO and Syria inched toward a settlement.

<HEAD>Report: States Should Provide Prenatal Care For Poor Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States should be required to provide health
care for all pregnant women with incomes below the federal poverty
standard, a House committee recommended Sunday in a bipartisan
report.
   The House Government Operations Committee said neonatal
intensive care and other health and education expenses resulting
from babies born prematurely cost three to 10 times as much as the
prenatal care that often prevents premature births.
   The panel said that as of January, only 26 states were taking
advantage of a two-year-old option to extend Medicaid to all
pregnant women with incomes below the federal poverty level _
$9,690, for example, for a family of three.
   Three other states were planning to take up a 1987 option
permitting expansion of the program to pregnant women with incomes
up to 185 percent of the federal poverty level.
   ``Since the majority of women below the poverty line cannot
possibly afford health insurance, it is necessary to require
Medicaid coverage for pregnant women below the federal poverty
line,'' the report said.
   Had all states covered prenatal care, labor and delivery costs
last year for such women, the report said, it would have cost the
Medicaid program $190 million.
   The unanimously approved committee report was based on an
investigation by the human resources subcommittee chaired by Rep.
Ted Weiss, D-N.Y.
   Among other things, it recommended that the Department of Health
and Human Services ensure that Medicaid reimbursement rates are
fair in order to ease serious spot shortages of doctors willing to
serve low-income women.
   The report said there are 15 California counties with no doctors
that accept Medicaid maternity patients, and similar problems have
been reported in the Northeast and Midwest.
   Citing various studies, the report said professional prenatal
care, not including labor and delivery fees, costs about $400,
while the lifetime cost of health and custodial care for a
low-birthweight handicapped infant can amount to 100 times that
much.
   About 40,000 U.S. infants born each year die before their first
birthday, a rate higher than many other industrialized nations. A
major cause of infant mortality is birthweight of less than 5.5
pounds. Research has repeatedly shown that the birth of such
babies, also at high risk for having permanent handicaps of all
kinds, can often be prevented with simple prenatal care.
   Congress has been allowing states to expand Medicaid to more
low-income pregnant women and children each year, but has not
required such coverage. States pay 50 to 80 percent of Medicaid
costs.
   ``If we are serious about saving lives and cutting the federal
deficit, we will immediately provide free prenatal care on the
women who need it,'' Weiss said in a statement. ``Spending more
money on prenatal care will save millions more in health care and
special education and other services, this year and in years to
come.''

<HEAD>Dukakis, On Whistle-Stop Tour, Focuses On Jobs Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Michael
Dukakis whistle-stopped across Pennsylvania on Sunday, promising
help to economically strapped communities and suggesting Republican
rival George Bush would rather build aircraft carriers than
rebuilding roads and trains.
   ``I think I know where the American people are _ they are tired
of crumbling bridges, congested airports, jammed highways, homeless
people on streets and in doorways...and they want a change,'' the
Democratic front-runner said.
   Dukakis, riding on his ``Pennsylvania Presidential Unlimited,''
also rejected as absurd suggestions from his remaining rival Jesse
Jackson that he should put forward a federal budget for a year
hence.
   In Pittsburgh, Greensburg, Johnstown and Altoona, the
Massachusetts governor concentrated on economic development and
jobs as he toured on the chartered Amtrak train two days before the
Pennsylvania primary.
   ``If we can't bring good jobs and economic opportunity back to
the Johnstowns of this country, then there is something the matter
with us,'' he told a crowd outside the train station in Johnstown.
``I believe we can. I believe we're going to.''
   Dukakis leads Jackson in the polls here, but he campaigned hard,
looking for a fourth straight big-state victory to cement his claim
on the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination.
   Standing in a cold rain at the train station in Greensburg,
Dukakis related the economic problems of the steel and coal towns
to the problems in Massachusetts in the 1960s and 1970s.
   ``As a New Englander, we went through the same kind of pain and
economic distress as you have,'' he said. ``Our communities have
come back and these communities are going to come back.''
   Dukakis rejected recent criticism from Bush, the Republican
nominee-to-be, for his opposition to building two new super carrier
task forces, that he said would cost $36 billion.
   ``If he thinks that's where we ought to put our scarce
resources, then so be it. But it's going to be a fundamental issue
in this campaign,'' he said, adding his litany of bridges, airports
and highways that need rebuilding.
   In an interview on the train, Dukakis hit Bush on Amtrak. The
Reagan adminstration has proposed cutting off its government
subsidies, a move some say would kill the system.
   ``What's he for? Is he for destroying Amtrak?'' Dukakis said.
``If he is, he can't conceiveably understand what it takes to build
a strong economic future not only in the Northeast corridor, but
all over this country?''
   Then, adding a charge he has made sometimes against fellow
Democrats, Dukakis said of Bush: ``He's never balanced a budget.
I've had to make these tough choices.''
   The Massachusetts governor rejected Jackson's suggestion that he
put forward a proposed federal budget now.
   ``You can't prepare a budget now for next year _ that's
absurd,'' he told reporters on the train.
   ``I've been very specific,'' he added. `You can't build a strong
ecnomic future in the country unless it's based on on a very solid
fiscal foundation and what the next president is going to have to
do is a combination of deficit reduction and targeted investments
and economic growth at the same time.''
   Asked what he thought Jackson was doing with his pressure to put
budget specifics out on the table, Dukakis answered: ``I don't know
what he's trying to do.''
   On education, Dukakis said: ``We're not going to run the
nation's school system from Washington. The thing a president has
to do is to set some priorities and got after them.''
   And at a news conference in Johnstown,Dukakis added:
   ``Any candidate who proposes a budget now for next year doesn't
know what budgeting is all about, couldn't possibly imagine or
understand what it is to put a budget together.
   ``I'll lay out where I'm going to make the cuts _ I've done that
in great detail. I'll lay out where I think we ought to do some
investing _ I've done that in great detail.''
   He referred to experience in 1975 _ when he had to go back on a
no tax pledge because of budget deficits:
   ``I had to eat an awful lot of crow and I'm never going to make
that mistake again....If it is one thing I have learned very
painfully is that you can't be drawing up budgets today for next
year. No candidate knows exactly what you're going to confront.''
   At the train station in Johnstown, Dukakis faced several dozen
anti-abortion demonstrators who chanted slogans.

Arabian-owned tanker in the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday after
President Reagan said the U.S. Navy will no longer ignore attacks
on noncombatants in the Persian Gulf region.
   The speedboat fired rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns
at the 37,011-ton Sea Trader in the strait, the southern entrance
to the gulf.
   An unexploded rocket dangled from the Sea Trader's hull after
the attack but fell into the sea before the tanker reached the port
of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
   The Indian master, Capt. B.R. Pagarkar, reported his vessel
sustained slight damage and no casualties among the Indian crew.
   It was not known whether any U.S. warships were near the Sea
Trader during the attack. Navy officials do not disclose warships'
movements, but several U.S. frigates and destroyers have been in
the southern gulf since last week, when U.S. and Iranian ships
skirmished in the area.
   Reagan warned Iran in his weekly radio broadcast Saturday that
continued attacks on neutral parties, including gulf shipping,
``will be very costly to Iran and its people.''
   On Friday, U.S. officials disclosed in Washington that the
Reagan administration was planning to expand the U.S. naval role in
the gulf by giving American commanders the right to intervene in
Iranian attacks on non-U.S. flag vessels.
   Previously, U.S. warships have only been permitted to provide
``humanitaran aid'' to non-American ships in distress and
requesting aid, but not to intercede in armed conflict involving
those ships.
   Gulf-based shipping executives, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Sea Trader encountered a flotilla of six armed
speedboats as it sailed into the gulf through the strait about 7:30
a.m. (11:30 p.m. EDT Saturday).
   The tanker, owned by a Saudi firm but flying the Liberian flag,
was bound for the Saudi oil port of Ras Tanura.
   Pagarkar said five of the speedboats ``went in one direction
while one appeared to be heading for another tanker, and I thought
we'd escaped an attack. But suddenly it veered toward my ship,
asking for the master.''
   The executives quoted him as saying the speedboat opened fire
after the Iranians demanded the ship's destination and indicated
they intended to board it.
   There was nothing to directly link the raid on the Sea Trader to
Reagan's comments or to an earlier report that the United States
was preparing to adopt a new get-tough policy following last week's
skirmishes between Iran and the U.S. Navy.
   But the attack, the first since two ships were hit Tuesday in
the aftermath of a major U.S.-Iranian clash the day before,
suggested Iran was determined to show its ability to carry out
shipping raids despite its losses.
   In the skirmishes April 18, U.S. Navy forces sank or damaged a
half-dozen of Iran's armed craft, including two frigates that have
regularly operated in the strait and nearby waters.
   There have been no reports since April 8 of Iraqi air strikes on
Iranian oil tankers, the type of attacks for which Iran customarily
retaliates by striking at neutral vessels.
   Iraq's last reported action in the gulf was Friday, when the
official Iraqi news agency said Baghdad's forces sunk a small
Iranian naval craft. That claim was not confirmed by ndependent
sources or Iran, which is fighting a 7{-year-old war with Iraq.
   U.S. military sources, speaking anonymously, said Iran
apparently fired its only remaining Harpoon anti-ship missile
during the skirmishes April 18.
   The weapon was one of nine given to the Iranian navy by the
United States during the rule of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
   U.S. intelligence sources told The Associated Press in September
that evidence indicated Iran had one operational Harpoon and made a
practice of mounting it on a Kaman-class boat ``just for show.''
   It was fired by a Kaman-class patrol boat in an encounter with
the U.S. guided missile frigate Wainwright and the guided missile
frigate Simpson during the April 18 skirmishes.
   The Iranian patrol boat fired at the 8,200-ton Wainwright from a
distance of about 12 miles. The sources said the Wainwright fired
defensive ``chaff'' rockets, filled with shards of aluminum and
other materials, to confuse the missile's radar guidance system.
   The missile sailed over the cruiser and fell into the water.
Almost simultaneously, the Simpson fired a Harpoon that destroyed
the Iranian boat.

<HEAD>Government Economist Sees Big Economic, Pleasure Loss In Smaller
Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy would lose $4.80 for every
gallon of gas saved in steering car buyers away from the
``convenience and pleasure'' of bigger cars, according to a
government economist.
   The economist, Andrew N. Kleit, a member of the Federal Trade
Commission staff, argues that car buyers should not be induced to
give up big cars and says just as much fuel would be saved by an
additional tax on gasoline of 2 or 3 cents a gallon.
   ``People clearly get pleasure from buying large cars and I don't
see anything illicit in that at all,'' Kleit said in an interview
about his report, ``The Impact of Automobile Fuel Economy
Standards.'' He said the report represents his own views and not
those of the FTC' Bureau of Economics which published it as Working
Paper No. 160.
   At the urging of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., the
Transportation Department lowered the standard manufactures must
meet from an average of 27.5 miles per gallon for all their cars to
26 mpg for 1986 and 1987 cars. It was kept at 26 mpg for 1988, but
will revert to 27.5 mpg for the 1989 model year unless the
department acts again.
   Kleit's study of 1986 and 1987 models, which he says represents
his own views and not those of the commission, is being used by
people who are trying to abolish these Corporate Average Fuel
Economy, or CAFE, standards.
   Congress imposed the standards in 1975 because it was spooked by
the 1973 Arab oil embargo and long gasoline lines. The standards
were meant as a fuel-saving alternative to higher taxes on fuel or
imported crude oil.
   Higher standards are supported by environmentalists who want to
see less fossil fuel burned.
   Opponents of the higher standards include auto safety proponents
who estimate that a 1 mpg increase in the standard for 1989 cars
could mean an extra 220 to 390 deaths a year for a decade. Large
cars are generally considered safer than small ones.
   To have met the higher standard in 1986 and 1987, Kleit said in
an interview, about a million buyers would have had to switch from
large to small cars. The only way to do this, he said, would have
been to raise the price of the average domestic large car by about
$1,200 and lower the price of the average domestic small car by
about $800.
   He said buyers would not have spent the $3.3 billion they were
willing to put up for the satisfaction of owning and driving larger
cars _ ``that many dollars worth of convenience and pleasure,'' as
shown by the difference in the prices of large cars people bought
and small ones they would have bought.
   Profits to U.S. manufacturers would have been $111 million less
_ declines at GM and Ford partially offset by increases at Chrysler
_ so the loss to the economy would have been the sum of the two
numbers, more than $3.4 billion, Kleit said.
   About 712 million gallons of gasoline would be saved over the
lives of the cars, Kleit calculated. So the cost per gallon saved
would have been simply $3.4 billion divided by this number of
gallons _ $4.80 in round figures. Different assumptions could make
it anywhere from $3.71 to $6.21, he said.
   ``While CAFE policy can save gasoline, it does so at a
prohibitive cost to the economy,'' Kleit wrote.
   One of his critics, Tina Hobson, head of the Renew America
Project, a group advocating conservation and use of renewable
energy sources, said Kleit's work ignored ``the need to disconnect
macho from cars. ... We need to unlink car ownership from personal
satisfaction.''
   Alan Durning of the Worldwatch Institute, coauthor of a recent
paper urging more conservation, said of Kleit's proposition, ``It's
a bit of fancy footwork about a fine point.''

   It wasn't just another week at the
small federal courthouse here, and it looks like more to come as
Mick Jagger takes the stand again Monday in the trial over whether
he plagiarized his 1985 hit ``Just Another Night.''
   Excited fans, autograph-seeking court employees, rumors of free
concerts and milling reporters have turned the rock star's court
battle into a circus.
   The unimposing, cramped court, a former office building
converted in 1983, is 25 miles north and light years away from the
majestic Beaux Arts federal courthouse in Manhattan's Foley Square
where the suit was first filed. The building has a single elevator
and only four telephones _ a frustration for the horde of reporters
who've come from as far away as Australia.
   The building hosted the yearlong Chapter 11 bankruptcy case of
Texaco, but even that high-profile event didn't prepare the
courthouse for what would happen when a rock legend came to town.
   It began when Patrick Alley, a 36-year-old reggae musician from
the Bronx, filed a lawsuit Jan. 2, 1986, charging Jagger with
copyright infringement over the song's chorus. The suit was filed
in Foley Square and was assigned to U.S. District Judge Gerard
Goettel.
   Goettel was later transferred to White Plains and the case moved
north.
   Jagger managed one day of obscurity when the trial opened April
18, but the media was alerted Tuesday and by Wednesday, Goettel's
fourth-floor courtroom was beginning to fill with reporters and
excited fans.
   It was on Wednesday that Jagger greeted a handful of journalists
at the start of the day with a ``How are we all today?'' He said he
was battling the case because his ``credibility was on the line.''
   It was also Wednesday that one of Jagger's lawyers, Helene
Freeman, was stopped by federal marshals as she entered the
building and brought before U.S. Magistrate Joel Tyler. Tyler
ordered the lawyer to get autographs for his two daughters, his law
clerk and secretary.
   Later that day, drummer Lowell ``Sly'' Dunbar took the stand and
played his testimony, prompting a recess in a fraud case on the
third floor.
   Dunbar is alleged to have performed on both recordings, but
testified he could not remember drumming for Alley's recording made
in 1979.
   Jagger gave out autographs to the growing mob of fans.
   Thursday word got out that Jagger was going to testify and maybe
even play because his guitar and equipment were set up in the
courtroom.
   Rumors of a free concert spread and by Friday the crowds were
tremendous, causing the building security force to limit entry. If
a spectator left the courtroom, which seats about 50 uncomfortably,
for any reason, that was it. He was replaced.
   Throughout the three hours of Jagger's afternoon testimony, all
seats were filled.
   Jagger never did sing, but tapes of the song were played _ over
and over _ with even the jury swaying to the beat and the judge,
who said he doesn't like rock music, occasionally looking pained.
   A spirited recitation of ``Jumpin' Jack Flash,'' to demonstrate
how repetition was used in his music, was as close as Jagger came
to a concert.

<HEAD>Figure in Insider Trading Probe to Testify to Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Michael R. Milken, the king of junk bond
financing, appears before a congressional committee this week, more
will be on members' minds than the role of high-risk, high-yield
bonds in the nation's economy.
   Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is a pioneer in the use of
so-called junk bonds in corporate takeovers and also a key figure
in the government's investigation into Wall Street's insider
trading scandal. He would be the first central player in the
insider trading scandal to testify in public.
   A staff member for the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
said the panel has steered clear of attempting to learn the
direction of insider trading probes by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.
   ``We've done that deliberately so Drexel could not say at a
later date that we were using the congressional process to squeeze
them,'' the aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Because of that, the aide said, problems associated with junk
bond financing, not insider trading, will be the focus of this
week's hearings.
   Even so, Milken's attorneys have indicated to the subcommittee
``there is a good chance he will claim the Fifth Amendment,'' the
staffer said.
   Drexel disclosed in February that the SEC had notified the firm
that its staff planned to recommend civil charges against the firm
and some of its employees for securities law violations. The firm
has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
   Since the indictment nearly a year and a half ago of speculator
Ivan Boesky, members of Congress have been hungry for news about
the progress or lack of progress in the SEC probe.
   They've gotten little to allay their curiosity. Last May, John
Shad, then SEC chairman, told senators they could expect to see
``succession of shoes dropping through the summer.''
   No shoes fell, and in December, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking subcommittee on securities,
pressed Shad's successor, David S. Ruder, for an explanation.
   Ruder said he expected additional ``major cases,'' but said the
cases were ``exceedingly complicated'' and their completion months
away.
   The House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on investigations,
which subpoenaed Milken to appear Wednesday, has also been
examining the insider-trading scandal. Drexel chief executive
Frederick Joseph is scheduled to appear Thursday.
   The investigations subcommittee met behind closed doors last
June to hear from Dennis B. Levine, a merger specialist at Drexel
who was convicted of securities fraud and is now serving a sentence
at federal prison in Lewisburg, Pa.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee and its investigations subcommittee, has said he
also would like to call Boesky, who is in federal prison at Lompoc,
Calif.
   Milken is the architect of Drexel's pioneering Beverly Hills,
Calif.,-based business in junk bonds, which have been frequently
used to help finance corporate takeovers like those in which Boesky
speculated.
   Critics of corporate takeovers maintain that the buildup of
thinly secured debt is dangerous to the economy.
   Meanwhile, concern in the Senate about the SEC investigation has
not gone away.
   Riegle, in December, had asked for a letter from Ruder on the
status of the probe and received what a Senate staff member, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, described as a ``pro forma''
response.
   The aide said Senate Banking Committee Chairman William
Proxmire, D-Wis., is also anxious to see results.
   ``I think Proxmire will probably wait until the end of the
summer and then ... seek some satisfaction why this investigation
is taking so long. We won't drop the ball, but at the same time we
have a lot of confidence in the SEC and the prosecutor's office in
New York,'' the aide said.

<HEAD>Stella Nickell's Daughter To Testify Against Her In Tampering
Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY McDONALD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The daughter of a woman on trial in the
drug-tampering deaths of her husband and another person takes the
stand this week, and prosecutors say she will testify her mother
repeatedly discussed ways to get rid of her stepfather.
   Authorities say Stella Nickell, the first person in the United
States to be tried on federal charges of causing death by tampering
with over-the-counter capsules, plotted to kill Bruce Nickell to
collect insurance.
   The cyanide poisoning deaths contributed to a nationwide
tampering scare, and Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers recalled
all its non-prescription medicine sold in capsule form.
   Cindy Hamilton, Mrs. Nickell's daughter, was scheduled to
testify Monday. The government alleges that over several years Mrs.
Nickell discussed drugs and overdoses and hit men with her
daughter, and eventually began interjecting her husband's name into
the conversations.
   The marriage was unhappy, but Mrs. Nickell was determined not to
lose her trailer home in Auburn, a suburb between Seattle and
Tacoma, in a divorce, prosecutors say. Witnesses have testified
that the Nickells were several thousand dollars in debt when
Nickell died in June 1986, and faced foreclosure on the home.
   But Thomas Hillier, the federal public defender representing
Mrs. Nickell, said Ms. Hamilton is not a credible witness, had been
a drug abuser, and was probably thinking of the $300,000 reward
established by a pharmaceutical group when she contacted the FBI in
January 1987.
   Mrs. Nickell is charged in the 1986 deaths of Nickell, 52, and
of Susan Katherine Snow, 40, also of Auburn, and accused of putting
cyanide in capsules of Extra-Strength Excedrin.
   The prosecution has suggested no links between the victims
except the manner of their deaths, and says that Mrs. Nickell
planted cyanide-tainted capsules in local stores to divert
suspicion after she poisoned her husband.
   Mrs. Nickell also faces three counts of tampering with a product
involved in interstate commerce in the tainting of capsules in two
Extra-Strength Excedrin bottles and an Anacin-3 bottle that were
recovered in stores in Auburn and nearby Kent.
   In the first two days of testimony last week, FBI agent Ron
Nichols said Mrs. Nickell told him she wasn't interested in
benefiting financially from her husband's death, but denied that
there were three life insurance policies.
   Mrs. Nickell said in November 1986 that her husband had only a
$25,000 state employees life insurance policy, Nichols testified.
But witnesses testified that policy was really worth $31,000 if
Nickell had died of natural causes, and $136,000 if he died of
accidental causes.
   That's why Mrs. Nickell pressed medical authorities for a more
specific cause of death when they initially ruled he died of
emphysema, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida.
   It was only after Ms. Snow's death was confirmed as caused by
acute cyanide poisoning that Nickell's cause of death was
re-examined.
   Prosecutors say they will present two additional insurance
policies worth $20,000 each, including at least one on which Mrs.
Nickell allegedly forged her husband's name. The total benefits of
the three policies could have reached $176,000.
   In his opening statement, Hillier told jurors there are
reasonable explanations for many of the prosecution's points, and
that the government's case is largely circumstantial.
   He said Mrs. Nickell will take the stand and contradict her
daughter's testimony.
   Trial resumes Monday with the continuation of testimony by
Bonnie Anderson, a former co-worker of Mrs. Nickell's.
   Ms. Anderson testified last week that on the day after Nickell
died, she was with Mrs. Nickell when she told Ms. Hamilton about
her stepfather's death.
   ``She looked Cindy straight in the eye and said, `I know what
you're thinking and the answer is no,''' Ms. Anderson testified.
   Ms. Anderson also said Mrs. Nickell had discussed marital
problems when the two worked as security officers at Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport.
   ``She said she liked being on the late shift because she didn't
have to see so much of Bruce,'' Ms. Anderson said.

Explosions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Investigators searching for the cause of two
explosions that destroyed a grain elevator examined the rubble
Sunday after recovering the last body of five workers killed in the
blasts.
   ``There's a strong possibility'' that ignited grain dust sparked
the explosions that flattened the ADM Growmark granary but ``it
could be days'' before the exact cause and origin of the blasts are
pinpointed, Joliet Fire Chief George Plese said Sunday. Airborne
grain dust can be highly explosive.
   After working non-stop for about 29 hours, about 100 volunteers
and professionals using cranes and bulldozers uncovered the bodies
of three workers Saturday who had been missing since Friday's
explosion, Plese said.
   The last of the five victims were found in the basement of the
granary, crushed by the wave of corn and soybeans that had swept
them there, the chief said.
   The bodies were discovered within half an hour of each other at
the complex on the Des Plaines River about 40 miles southwest of
Chicago, said police detective Alan Horvath.
   ``As far as I can tell from the preliminary examinations at the
scene there was no burning on these bodies,'' Will County Deputy
Coroner William Ferguson said Saturday night. ``Indications are
that they would have died instantly from the injuries.''
   Officials finally ruled out a witness' report that the blasts
had blown a worker off a barge and into the river, and a search of
the river was called off, Plese said.
   Authorities believe that airborne grain dust was ignited in the
first explosion, which apparently ruptured a natural gas main and
touched off a second blast moments later, Plese said.
   The blasts turned the 100-foot silos at the site into
30-foot-high mounds of twisted steel, reinforced concrete and
70,000 bushels of corn and soybeans, Plese said.
   ``We had to dig through all of that to get at these people who
were buried,'' he said by phone Sunday from Joliet.
   By late Saturday, when the bodies of the missing men were found,
most of the debris had been hauled away to a nearby landfill, he
said.
   Investigators from the Illinois office of the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration impounded much of the structural
steel, Plese said.
   Plese said he was moved by the help from local construction
trade unions, trucking and wrecking companies and fire departments
in the area who volunteered in the rescue effort.
   About 60 volunteers joined the estimated 40 workers at the scene
who sifted through rubble ``non-stop from the time it blew up until
we dug them out,'' he said.
   The victims found Saturday were identified as Donald E. Zack of
Joliet, Daniel McLaughlin, 18, of Manhattan, and Michael Dupuis,
23, of Bourbonnais, said the deputy coroner.
   The bodies of Mark Stewart, 20, of Princeton, and Dale Brent
Slatton, 28, of Newark, were found Friday.
   Three people were injured in the blasts; only one remained
hospitalized Sunday, in fair condition.

   U.S. Sen. David Karnes faces a tough battle
in the Republican primary May 10, and even if he survives that, he
is not expected to fare well against popular ex-Gov. Bob Kerrey in
November.
   GOP voters will have to look closely to find substantial
differences between Karnes and his primary challenger, U.S. Rep.
Hal Daub, both of whom espouse a conservative philosophy, according
to Republican stalwarts.
   ``The major difference I see in them is probably in style,''
said state GOP Chairman Norm Riffel.
   Their similarity may be making the decision a hard one for
voters in the primary.
   A March poll taken for the Omaha World-Herald showed Karnes
favored 42 percent to 38 percent, but that's with a margin of error
of 5.1 percentage points. A December poll showed Daub with a
5-point lead.
   While an incumbent doesn't usually face a tough primary fight,
Karnes didn't take office by the usual route. A political unknown,
he was appointed in March 1987 by Republican Gov. Kay Orr to fill
the unexpired term of the late Sen. Edward Zorinsky, a Democrat.
   Daub, a four-term congressman from the Omaha-dominated 2nd
District, was one of the better-known GOP regulars who sought the
appointment.
   ``He has been appointed and not elected. That's the main
difference between us. I've laid it on the line,'' Daub said.
   Karnes' future may be linked to the political popularity of Mrs.
Orr. A March poll taken for the World-Herald found that her
popularity rating was 48 percent, the first time it was below 50
percent in her 14 months in office.
   Daub has indirectly argued that Karnes is the governor's
candidate and thus may be vulnerable if Nebraskans are unhappy with
her.
   Whatever happens in the primary, the winner will have to face
Kerrey, whose popularity has bedeviled the GOP for years. Kerrey
faces token opposition in the Democratic primary from Ken
Michaelis, who was disbarred in 1982 for what the state Supreme
Court called ``scurrilous attacks upon the bar and bench.''
   Kerrey was virtually unknown when he stepped from private life
into the governor's race in 1982 and, in his first political
effort, defeated incumbent Republican Charles Thone.
   His one-time romantic relationship with actress Debra Winger,
and her frequent and lengthy stays at the governor's mansion,
appeared to only endear Kerrey further to Nebraskans.
   The hallmark of Kerrey's style has been his willingness to
adjust positions on important issues, ranging from school district
consolidation to pay raises for state employees, whenever he
thought necessary.
   He has said he never hesitated to change his mind on the basis
of new information or better analysis. ``Only dead men and fools
don't change their minds,'' he once said.
   But the most frequent criticism of Kerrey, from political
friends as well as foes, has been that he is unpredictable on even
the most major state issues.
   At the outset of his Senate campaign, Kerrey frequently said,
``I don't have all the answers,'' but emphasized his long-expressed
concern for the educational system and the need to bring the
federal deficit into line.
   Kerrey lost one leg below the knee during a Navy SEAL team
operation in the Vietnam War. He was awarded the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

   The death toll from Lebanon's worst car
bombing in three years climbed to 69 Sunday after 15 of the wounded
died in hospitals. One man was dragged injured but alive from a
wrecked building.
   Tripoli's eight hospitals were filled to capcity with casualties
and morgues were ``packed with corpses,'' police said.
   Local officials in the northern port city declared two days of
public mourning for the victims of Saturday's explosion in a
crowded vegetable market that knocked down buildings and set dozens
of cars ablaze.
   Police said 111 people were wounded from the blast in the
low-income Tabbaneh district of Tripoli, the country's
second-largest city. Radio stations broadcast urgent appeals for
blood.
   Civil defense rescue teams who clawed through the rubble during
the night called off their search early Sunday after dragging the
33-year-old survivor, a grocer, to safety at about midnight, police
reported.
   The man, who was not identified, had been buried for more than
16 hours. He was taken to Batroun hospital, 15 miles south of
Tripoli, because the city's hospitals were already overflowing with
casualties.
   Police said no one else was listed as missing or believed to be
buried in the wreckage.
   Tripoli, whose 850,000 population is predominantly Sunni Moslem,
is 50 miles north of the capital, Beirut.
   Tripoli's coordination committee, senior civil servants and
local notables who run the day-to-day affairs of the city, on
Sunday drew up funeral plans for the victims while shops and
businesses closed in mourning.
   The committee was formed to handle municipal affairs because the
central government's authority has been eroded by the country's
13-year-old civil war between Moslems and Christians.
   Police said a black pickup truck used in Saturday's bombing was
loaded with vegetables and 330 pounds of TNT.
   It exploded while the market was filled with shoppers on the
seventh day of Islam's holy month of Ramadan, when devout Moslems
fast from sunrise to sunset.
   No group has claimed responsibility for Saturday's bombing, and
police said they had no clues about who was behind the carnage.
   Earlier car bombings have been blamed on the civil war
hostilities as well as other feuds involving Palestinians, Syrians
and Israelis in Lebanon. More than 130,000 people have been killed
since the war broke out in April 1975.
   Saturday's atrocity was the first major car bombing in Lebanon
this year. It was the bloodiest car bombing in Lebanon since March
8, 1985, when 80 people were killed and 250 wounded in the Shiite
Moslem district of Bir el-Abed in south Beirut.
   Another car bomb exploded outside an ice cream parlor in Tripoli
June 29, 1985. Sixty people were killed and 110 wounded.
   There were 16 car bombings in 1987 in which 57 people were
killed and 288 wounded.

<HEAD>Judge Dislikes Law Which Led To His Ruling That Brom Be Tried As
Juvenile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge said he does not agree with
trying a 16-year-old as a juvenile for the ax slayings of his
parents and two siblings but insisted the law gives him no choice.
   District Judge Gerard Ring said Friday he hopes the case will
prompt the Legislature to review the law on juvenile crime.
   ``Under the present law, I can give the same disposition to a
juvenile for stealing a Baby Ruth candy bar as for murdering baby
Ruth,'' he said. ``I have never agreed with that.''
   Ring denied a motion to have David Brom tried as an adult on
charges of murdering his parents, Bernard and Paulette Brom, his
brother Ricky, 11, and sister, Diane, 14, at the family's home Feb.
18.
   If Brom is convicted as a juvenile, he will be released at age
19 or when he has been deemed rehabilitated, whichever comes first.
If triedas an adult and convicted, he would face a life sentence
with parole eligibility after about 17{ years.
   To try a juvenile as an adult, state law requires the prosecutor
to show that the child is not suited to rehabilitative treatment
and is a danger to the community.
   Ring wrote in a ruling released Friday that neither standard
applied to Brom, who was described by a court-appointed
psychiatrist as ``deferential, polite, and compliant,'' and had no
prior record.
   ``I don't agree at all with the outcome,'' the judge said. At
the same time, he said, ``I know the decision was the correct one
legally.''
   Olmsted County Attorney Ray Schmitz said he will appeal the
ruling.
   Sheriff Charles Von Wald and Police Chief Pat Farrell complained
that the ruling focused too much on rehabilitation and not
punishment.
   But Ring countered, ``There is nothing in the statute about
punishment. And it does require consideration of treatment.'' He
said he disagrees with the juvenile court concept that looks only
to the child's needs.
   The psychiatrist, Dr. Carl Malmquist, testified earlier this
month that Brom described the killings to him and that depression
made Brom suicidal and eventually homicidal.
   An older brother, Joseph, 19, lived away from the Brom home and
is the only other survivor of the immediate family.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Says School System `Still At Risk'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: The Bennett report was embargoed for release on Tuesday, but
the embargo has been broken</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary William J. Bennett says
the American education system has made little progress in the five
years since a searing report called ``A Nation At Risk'' warned
that the system was sinking below ``a rising tide of mediocrity.''
   The school system, Bennett says in a report to be formally
delivered to President Reagan on Tuesday, ``is still at risk.''
   Bennett acknowledged that ``American education has made some
undeniable progress in the last few years. ... We are doing better
than we were in 1983.
   ``But,'' he wrote, ``we are certainly not doing well enough, and
we are not doing well enough fast enough. We are still at risk. The
absolute level at which our improvements are taking place is
unacceptably low.''
   Bennett decried the dropout rate, poor education of those who do
graduate from high school, the widely varying quality of school
curricula, the rarity of good schools for disadvantaged and
minority children, and the manner of promoting teachers and
principals ``that make excellence a matter of chance, not design.''
   He cited a recent Gallup Poll that found a wide majority of
Americans favoring school reforms, but said ``future reforms face
serious obstacles.''
   ``Above all, sound education reforms are threatened by the
determined opposition they elicit,'' Bennett said, pointing to
``what might be called opposition by extortion, the false claim
that to fix our schools will first require a fortune in new
funding.''
   In addition, Bennett said, ``More and more, the opposition to
school reform is now manifested in the narrow, self-interested
exercise of political power in statehouse corridors and local
school board meetings. Almost without fail, wherever a worthwhile
school proposal or legislative initiative is under consideration,
those with a vested interest in the educational status quo will use
political muscle to block reform. And too often the anti-reformers
succeed. ... If our schools are to improve, that power must be
overcome.''
   Many experts agree that the U.S. school system needs upgrading,
but some say the federal government is part of the problem.
   National Education Association President Mary Hatwood Futrell
has charged that school reform is ``withering on the vine'' due to
lack of federal funds. The union will mark the fifth anniversary of
the release of the ``Nation At Risk'' report with a protest Tuesday
in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House.
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said, ``There's no evidence that reform is working for
any of our kids, except maybe the 20 percent who have always made
it in the traditional school system.''
   The Education Commission of the States has found that 45 states
and the District of Columbia have raised graduation standards since
1980. The average high school student in 1987 had to take nearly 20
units of credit to graduate, up from 17 in 1980.
   However, the Committee for Economic Development, led by top
business executives, and the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching have concluded that school reforms have had
little or no impact on urban schools.
   The ``Nation At Risk'' report was prepared by the National
Commission on Excellence in Education, a panel of 18 citizens
appointed by then-Secretary of Education T.H. Bell in August 1981
to address ``the widespread public perception that something is
seriously remiss in our educational system.''
   ``The educational foundations of our society are presently being
eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very
future as a nation and a people,'' the report said.

   Voters in Guatemala's smaller cities and
municipal districts cast ballots Sunday for mayors and city
councils in the country's first elections since a civilian
government took office in January 1986.
   Nearly 1.3 million people were registered to vote in the
elections in 271 municipalities with populations under 20,000.
   Mayors and councils in the 51 larger cities were elected to
5-year terms in 1985. Under the 1986 constitution, the terms for
municipal offices are for 30 months. When the terms expire in the
51 cities in 1990 the new office holders will serve for 30 months.
   President Vinicio Cerezo's centrist Christian Democrat Party
holds 148 of the 271 mayoralties that were contested Sunday.
   Among other parties running were the Union of the National
Center that holds 58 mayoralties; the National Liberation Movement
and several other right-wing parties, and the Social Democrats.
   Cerezo, the first civilian president since 1970, has been under
fire in recent months over tax hikes and other economic measures
and the strong role still played by the military.
   The Supreme Electoral Tribunal was expected to announce on
Monday substantial results of the balloting.

   A man who raped and savagely mutilated a
teen-age girl nine years ago will finish his parole Monday, paying
his legal debt in full. But it's unlikely the crime will ever stop
dogging him or haunting his victim.
   ``I never live in the past,'' Lawrence Singleton, 60, said in a
recent television interview. But he continually argues that he was
innocent, and public outrage follows him wherever he goes.
   ``I'll never get over this,'' says Mary Vincent. Singleton
hacked off her forearms with an ax on Sept. 29, 1978, and left her
for dead in Stanislaus County, east of San Francisco.
   Acquaintances say both convict and victim feel oppressed by the
public's continued interest in them; neither would consent to an
interview.
   Vincent, who lives in seclusion in the Pacific Northwest, has
said in published interviews that her fear has been revived by
Singleton's impending freedom.
   Parole officials and Singleton's friends are concerned about his
safety wherever he tries to settle. When he was released a year ago
on parole, furious protests followed him from town to town when
state officials tried to find a place for him to live. He wound up
in a mobile home on the grounds of San Quentin prison, and last
week officials moved him to an undisclosed location.
   ``Here's a girl who lost her arms and will never get them back,
and here's the guy who did it. He got 14 years and he's out in
eight,'' said Stanislaus County District Attorney Donald Stahl, who
prosecuted Singleton.
   ``There ain't no justice _ it's the thing I hear over and over
and over from everyone,'' he said.
   Singleton himself claims justice was not done, insisting someone
else attacked and maimed Vincent, who was hitchiking. He also
claims she attacked him.
   But in 1979, a jury in San Diego convicted the former merchant
sailor of kidnap, rape, mayhem and attempted murder in the attack
on Vincent, then 15 years old.
   Vincent was discovered naked, with her forearms hacked off, on a
rural road.
   She told police her attacker was a man named Larry who picked
her up in Berkeley and told her he would take her to Los Angeles
but instead took her to a deserted area near Modesto. She also
identified Singleton.
   Singleton was arrested 10 days later in Sparks, Nev. Detectives
found the burned remains of Vincent's clothes in the fireplace of
Singleton's house in San Pablo.
   Singleton was sentenced to 14 years and four months in prison,
then the legal maximum. He was released early on parole in April
1987 because of good behavior and work credits.
   On Monday, Singleton will be free to go wherever he likes and is
under no obligation to tell prison officials where he is going.
   Thomas Clyde Smith Jr., pastor of Bride of Christ Church in
Azalea, Ore., said Wednesday that Singleton called him April 14 to
accept his offer to let him join the church, where he would have
work and a place to live. Smith said Singleton told him he planned
to visit relatives in Florida first.
   Parole officials have said Singleton should be a law-abiding
citizen, if he is given a chance and if he continues to abstain
from alcohol. He was drinking heavily the day of the attack on
Vincent.
   Singleton took a polygraph test arranged by a local public
television station on April 16, and his answers showed he believes
the truth of his denials, according to polygraph expert Francis
Connolly.
   Many, including Stahl, still fear Singleton is dangerous. And
residents of Azalea object to the idea of him settling there.
   Shirley Almeida, vice president of the Torrance-based Coalition
on Victims Equal Rights and herself a victim of a violent crime,
put herself in Vincent's place.
   ``I would feel so frightened. I would be constantly looking over
my shoulder, looking for him,'' Almeida said. ``It's the thought:
`He will find me. If he wants to badly enough, he will find me.'''

<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The archbishop of Nicaragua said
Sunday he believes the United States and Sandinista government
ultimately will hold talks despite President Reagan's staunch
support of the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo said peace talks
between the government and the rebels, known as Contras, may be a
prelude to bilateral talks between the Sandinistas and the United
States.
   ``I am not a political expert,'' he said. ``But I believe that
as the Nicaraguan government moves toward democratization and it
and the Contras fulfill the peace agreements, the time will come
when the two (Nicaragua and the United States) will sit down face
to face.
   ``Remember that the same was said about the (Contra) peace
talks. Remember how the government here said the stars would fall
from the sky before any talks. It is a wise man that changes his
mind.''
   Obando y Bravo, who acted as mediator during initial talks
between the rebels and government, spoke with reporters after Mass
at the La Sierrita church. He was asked about President Daniel
Ortega's request for talks with the United States.
   Ortega on Friday said the two countries should resume
discussions on ``matters of security'' in the Mexican seaside
resort of Manzanillo. The United States has not responded.
   U.S.-Nicaraguan talks were held in Manzanillo in 1984. The
Reagan administration broke off the dialogue in January 1985.
   The rebels and Sandinistas signed a preliminary peace accord in
the southern border town of Sapoa on March 23. It called for a
60-day cease-fire that began April 1. During the truce the two
sides are to attempt to negotiate an end to the 6{-year-old
conflict that has cost more than 26,000 lives.
   They have held meetings recently in Managua. Obando y Bravo said
he expected the second round of the Contra-Sandinista peace talks
in Managua to begin as scheduled on Thursday.
   ``I believe that even though a peace treaty has not been signed,
much has been advanced. I know the climate of the negotations from
the beginning when things were very tense,'' he said.
   ``I think advances will continue to be made. We are Nicaraguans
and we must reach a settlement. Our young people are tired of the
war. Our people are tired of the war, tired of scarcity, tired of
everything.''
   The cardinal is a member of the National Commission on
Reconciliation and the Verification Commission, established to
determine if the two sides abide by the peace agreements.

   A supermarket opening billed as
a chance to ``discover the extraordinary'' became just that when a
rooftop parking lot collapsed into the crowded store, injuring 24
people.
   Hundreds of shoppers scrambled for the exits as the roof of the
100,000-square-foot Save-On-Foods store gave way Saturday, dropping
concrete slabs and 22 cars into the supermarket.
   Three of the injured remained in hospitals in stable condition
Sunday.
   Provincial authorities were called in to investigate the cause
of the collapse, said Staff Sgt. Gary Shauer, a Royal Canadian
Mounted Police spokesman.
   About 600 shoppers and 300 employees attending a senior
citizens' preview of the opening of $15 million store. Newspaper
ads for the store had proclaimed: ``Escape the ordinary _ discover
the extraordinary.''
   Witnesses said shoppers had about four minutes to clear out
after a broken water pipe prompted store officials to tell shoppers
over a public address system to leave the store immediately.
   ``I'd just turned my back for one second and down it came. There
was suddenly a tremendous gust of wind at my back as I ran,'' said
Robert Klein, a free-lance photographer.
   Some customers were slow to heed calls to evacuate. ``Some of
them wanted to keep on shopping,'' said Mark Clyde of nearby
Coquitlam. ``A lot of them didn't want to leave their buggies until
they got their quarters (deposits) back.''
   Minutes earlier, Save-On-Foods owner Jim Pattison, whose chain
leased space in the huge Metrotown shopping complex in this
Vancouver suburb, had cut a ribbon under the point where the
10,000-square-foot roof section thundered to the floor.
   ``It could have been a lot worse,'' said Pattison.
   Trevor Burkitt, a freelance photographer, took pictures as
debris fell around him, including one shot of a steel beam twisted
like taffy.
   ``I don't know what made me do it,'' said Burkitt. ``I just
didn't want to miss it. It sounded like thunder.''
   A forklift had to be brought in to lift concrete and material
off one man caught in the collapse.
   Grant Coldicutt, who had been working in the store's deli
section, said he moved quickly when the evacuation call came over
the loudspeakers.
   ``Then the ceiling came down,'' he said. ``I turned around and
looked at the deli section where I had been working and there were
dozens of cars parked in it.''
   David Chard, a spokesman for Station Square Developments Inc. of
Vancouver, which has completed half of the planned $75 million
Metrotown complex, said the company also will investigate the
collapse.
   The contractor, Amako Construction Ltd., issued a statement
saying it welcomed an investigation and was certain Amako would be
cleared of any blame.

<TEXT>
   National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen staked his
claim to France's future after his far-right views attracted
thousands of voters in Sunday's first round of the presidential
election.
   Le Pen drew about 14 percent of the vote overall and led all
nine candidates in Marseille, his southern stronghold and France's
third-largest city.
   Le Pen said his followers could decide the outcome of the May 8
runoff between Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, who
finished first in Sunday's balloting, and conservative Premier
Jacques Chirac, the runnerup.
   ``Nothing will ever again be done in France without the voters
of the National Front,'' Le Pen said on national television.
   ``We have the certainty of a political earthquake and a radical
transformation of the national landscape.''
   Running on an anti-immigration platform that asked voters to
choose between a ``French France'' and a ``Third World France,'' Le
Pen ran better than polls had predicted, making the National Front
the strongest extreme-right party in Europe.
   He said he would announce the National Front's voting strategy
on May 1 during a demonstration to honor Joan of Arc.
   Le Pen, 59, who announced his candidacy a year ago, portrayed
himself as an outsider with a chance to finish among the top two
candidates in the election's first round.
   But throughout the campaign he emphasized his potential to sway
the outcome of the final round.
   His campaign against immigration forced other candidates to
address the delicate issue, sometimes at their expense.
   Officials of Chirac's Rally for the Republic party have been
conferring with the National Front in search of an accord for the
second round, according to French press reports.
   National Front Secretary-General Jean-Pierre Stirbois said his
party will be ``very attentive'' to what Chirac has to propose on
immigration and the death penalty. The National Front wants the
death penalty restored.
   Le Pen has said he would not be willing to accept a ministerial
post, saying only the presidency or the premiership ``will show the
French that things have truly changed.''
   ``If the vote confirms the tendency indicated by the polls, in
the future it will be difficult to speak of the National Front as
an ephemeral extreme right current,'' Le Monde newspaper wrote in
its Saturday edition.
   Le Pen, a white-haired Breton and former paratrooper, founded
the National Front in 1974. But the group remained on the political
fringe for years.
   It entered national legislative elections in 1986 and now holds
33 of the 577 National Assembly seats.

   Soviet prima ballerina Maya Plisetskaya
says she hoped to catch up on her sleep during a series of
performances here with the Bolshoi Ballet but instead spent much of
her free time shopping.
   ``After all, sleep is kind of boring, isn't it?'' the
62-year-old Ms. Plisetskaya said with the help of an interpreter
Saturday. ``We've been everywhere. I've bought a lot of presents
for Moscow.''
   She spent one day buying shoes, accumulating nine pairs by day's
end, according to one of her hosts.
   Ms. Plisetskaya was one of 16 dancers of the Bolshoi Ballet to
visit Portland at the invitation of the Pacific Ballet Theatre.
They played to sold-out houses in a series of performances
Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.
   The box office receipts raised up to $80,000 for the struggling
Oregon dance troupe, said Henry Hillman, president of its ballet's
board of directors.
   The Bolshoi members left Sunday for Los Angeles for a final
performance before returning to the Soviet Union.

   Le Pen said his followers could decide the outcome of the May 8
runoff between Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, who
finished first in Sunday's balloting, and conservative Premier
Jacques Chirac, the runnerup.
   ``Nothing will ever again be done in France without the voters
of the National Front,'' Le Pen said on national television.
   ``We have the certainty of a political earthquake and a radical
transformation of the national landscape.''
   Running on an anti-immigration platform that asked voters to
choose between a ``French France'' and a ``Third World France,'' Le
Pen ran better than polls had predicted, making the National Front
the strongest extreme-right party in Europe.
   He said he would announce the National Front's voting strategy
on May 1 during a demonstration to honor Joan of Arc.
   Le Pen, 59, who announced his candidacy a year ago, portrayed
himself as an outsider with a chance to finish among the top two
candidates in the election's first round.
   But throughout the campaign he emphasized his potential to sway
the outcome of the final round.
   His campaign against immigration forced other candidates to
address the delicate issue, sometimes at their expense.
   Officials of Chirac's Rally for the Republic party have been
conferring with the National Front in search of an accord for the
second round, according to French press reports.
   National Front Secretary-General Jean-Pierre Stirbois said his
party will be ``very attentive'' to what Chirac has to propose on
immigration and the death penalty. The National Front wants the
death penalty restored.
   Le Pen has said he would not be willing to accept a ministerial
post, saying only the presidency or the premiership ``will show the
French that things have truly changed.''
   ``If the vote confirms the tendency indicated by the polls, in
the future it will be difficult to speak of the National Front as
an ephemeral extreme right current,'' Le Monde newspaper wrote in
its Saturday edition.
   Le Pen, a white-haired Breton and former paratrooper, founded
the National Front in 1974. But the group remained on the political
fringe for years.
   It entered national legislative elections in 1986 and now holds
33 of the 577 National Assembly seats.

<HEAD>Report Says Sexual Harassment of Women in Marines Still a Problem</HEAD>

   Sexual harassment of women in the Marine Corps
remains a problem that can be remedied by emphasizing that the
practice will not be tolerated, according to a Marine Corps report
released Sunday.
   The Task Force on Women in the Marine Corps said existing
directives and the corps' primary grievance system are
``appropriate tools to implement Marine Corps policy on this
issue.''
   However, the commandant of the corps must convey that sexual
harassment will not be tolerated in the service, according to the
executive summary of the final report.
   ``The (commandant) will improve sexual harassment awareness
training in formal schools and at the recruit depots,'' said the
report, which will be released Monday.
   The task force, formed in September 1987 at the request of
then-Secretary of Navy James Webb, said the corps did not have a
``significant problem'' with fraternization.
   ``Fraternization is not a gender-specific issue,'' the report
said. ``No corrective action was recommended.''
   In February, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci responded to a
Pentagon report by ordering expanded job opportunities for women in
the Marine Corps and the Air Force, including the assignment of
female Marines to embassy guard duty.
   Women account for about 10 percent of the nation's 2.1 million
military personnel. By law, they are excluded from combat.
   The content of the Pentagon report provided the basis of the
Marine Corps report released Sunday.
   The report also recommended certain steps to improve the quality
of life for female Marines, including solving the problem of
shortage in uniform items and lengthy delays in filling special
orders, ensuring full investigation when homosexual conduct is
suspected and allowing a pregnant Marine to request a 30-day delay
in the notification of her commander by the medical officer.
   The task force also recommended that the Navy surgeon general
review the policy regarding the assignment of obstetricians and
gynecologists to combat service units, and the commandant review
the number of women medical and dental personnel assigned to
various units.
   The Navy surgeon general also should publish information
regarding oral contraceptives for men, recreational programs should
be expanded and additional child care centers be built, the report
said.
   The commandant approved all the recommendations with the
exception of pregnancy notification and oral contraceptives for men.

   Eleven of 27 police officers taken
hostage by separatists in this French territory in the South
Pacific were freed Monday following elections for the French
presidency and local legislature.
   Four policemen were killed and at least 11 people were wounded
in election violence that began Friday as pro-independence
Melanesians tried to disrupt Sunday's balloting.
   French Defense Minister Andre Giraud announced in Paris that 11
of the 27 gendarmes taken hostage Friday on the island of Ouvea
were freed at dawn Monday. He provided no details.
   Three policemen were killed during the fighting at Ouvea and one
wounded officer died Sunday. Three civilians were wounded in the
Ouvea clash and on Sunday eight policemen were injured in three
separate attacks.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse quoted sources in
Noumea as saying the 11 officers were freed because of ``pressure
from tribal chiefs,''
   Ouvea is 90 miles northeast of Noumea, the capital.
   Authorities closed 38 of the 139 polling stations because of
gunfire and explosions during the elections in which voters cast
ballots for both the French presidency and the New Caledonian
legislature.
   Officials said the voter turnout was 56.3 percent, with militant
separatists boycotting the balloting.
   France's conservative Premier Jacques Chirac scored an
overwhelming victory in the New Caldenonian balloting for the
presidency, taking nearly 74.6 percent of the vote.
   In mainland France, Chirac was second among nine candidates,
winning about 20 percent of the vote. Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand won the French elections with about 35 percent of the
ballots and he and Chirac will be in the May 8 runoff election.
   Polls in New Caledonia closed Sunday just as those in most of
France were opening.
   In voting for the 48 legislative seats, the pro-French Rally for
the Republic in Caledonia won 35. It is the territorial branch of
Chirac's Rally for the Republic party.
   The extreme-right National Front won eight seats, two
conservative parties won three and dissident separatists two.
   Opposing the election ``was a first step, not an objective. Now
we're going to launch a second phase and maybe a third phase,''
said Leopold Joredie, the ``security minister'' for Kanaky, the
Kanak's self-proclaimed government.
   ``There are people here who are ready to fight to the end,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   Native Melanesians are known as Kanaks and make up 43 percent of
the island group's population of 145,000.
   About 36 percent of the residents are of European background
while most of the others are Asian or Tahitians.
   Many Kanaks seek independence, but a majority of the other
citizens want New Caledonia to remain part of France.
   It was the third time in less than four years that New
Caledonians have voted for representatives to new regional
institutions.
   The latest territorial assembly was created by Chirac's
government over the objections of separatists.
   French Minister for Overseas Territories Bernard Pons arrived in
Noumea early Monday.
   Chirac sent Pons to New Caledonia after militant Melanesians
killed three police officers and seized 27 hostages in the Ouvea
attack.
   A fourth officer, shot in the back of the head, died Sunday in a
Sydney, Australia, hospital.
   Three Melanesians were wounded in the fighting.
   The kidnappers demanded the regional elections be canceled and
that police reinforcements be removed from the island. They also
demanded that negotiators be sent from Paris to discuss
independence for the island.
   Violence flared again during the voting Sunday.
   One officer was shot in the abdomen while guarding a polling
station in Canala, on the island's east coast. He was listed in
serious condition at a hospital in Noumea. Another officer was
injured before polls opened in Pouembout, on the main island's west
coast 260 miles north of Noumea.
   Police in Noumea said separatists erected barricades in several
villages, including one outside Canala where six gendarmes were
injured Sunday afternoon.
   A spokesman for the National Gendarmerie said the six officers
were wounded by ``thrown explosives'' and were taken to a hospital
in Noumea, where one was in serious condition.
   In other parts of the archipelego, ballots were burned and
telephone lines were cut. Police used tear gas to disperse crowds
of protesters.
   A unit of 180 police reinforcements arrived in New Caledonia
Sunday morning.

   Seven girls struck by lightning as they
huddled under a tree at a softball field remained hospitalized
Sunday, four in serious condition, officials said.
   Eight members of a girl's softball team and their assistant
coach were injured Saturday during the downpour shortly before a
game at an elementary school near here.
   ``There was this huge snap, fire ball and all the girls were
thrown on the ground,'' said Carrie Leach, whose 8-year-old
daughter Katie was hurt. ``It was just awful. About half the girls
were laying on their stomachs and the rest were on their backs.''
   ``A couple of them started to turn blue because they couldn't
breathe,'' she said, adding that her daughter was among those who
``looked like they were about to die.''
   Coach John Bates administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation to
9-year-old Kaylee Whitfield, while assistant coach Steve Nicolai
worked on another child, witnesses said.
   ``She was gone,'' said Kaylee's mother, Kya Whitfield. ``I guess
it was just one of those things where you don't give up.''
   Kaylee and three teammate were in serious condition at
Children's Hospital of Orange County, said nursing supervisor
Sharon Bauer. Three children were listed in good condition at
Western Medical Center in Santa Ana.
   Nicolai, who recently had undergone heart surgery, and the
coach's 8-year-old daughter Carrie were treated at St. Joseph
Hospital and released.
   Bates had directed the team to wait out the downpour under the
50-foot tree.
   ``There was no lightning before I told the girls to get under
the tree,'' he said. ``And there was no thunder. Sure it was
overcast, but earlier that morning, the sun had been shining. This
all happened so suddenly.''

   More than 600,000 Americans put on their walking
shoes for charity over the weekend, raising an estimated $42
million for the March of Dimes, a spokeswoman said Sunday.
   People in more than 1,300 communities across the nation walked
an average of 15.5 to 18.6 miles in ``walkathons'' on Saturday and
Sunday, said Marcia Stein. The March of Dimes holds such
fund-raisers every year.
   Walkers solicited pledges from friends, neighbors and
colleagues, who promised to pay them for each kilometer they
completed. The money goes toward fighting birth defects.
   Pledges were up 5 percent over 1987, the March of Dimes said.
``All indications are that this year's walk will set a new
record,'' said President Charles Massey.

<DATELINE>AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas stormed a highland
farming hamlet, held a mock trial and killed 20 peasants to avenge
the slayings of three rebels, police said Sunday.
   In Lima, two policemen were shot and killed Saturday as they
walked their beat in a working class neighborhood, according to
officials.
   Police blamed both attacks on members of the Maoist Shining Path
movement, which has been fighting for eight years to topple the
government.
   About 30 guerrillas attacked the farming community of Aranhuay
on Wednesday and ordered some 200 people to attend a ``trial'' in
the village square, police reported.
   They said gunmen, wearing Peruvian army uniforms, pulled 20 men
from the crowd and shot them after accusing them of being members
of a self-defense patrol.
   Aranhuay is 30 miles north of Ayacucho, which is 230 miles
southeast of Lima. Police said the account of the massacre came
from peasants who fled to Ayacucho seeking protection.
   They said the refugees told them the guerrillas were seeking to
avenge the deaths of three Shining Path members killed when the
Aranhuay peasant patrol aided army troops in a clash with rebels in
February.
   The Shining Path has killed hundreds of members of self-defense
patrols since the units were organized by the military in 1984.
   Civil rights groups and opposition politicians have accused the
military of abandoning the patrols, which are frequently armed only
with pitchforks and knives.
   The government says more than 10,000 people, including nearly
600 policemen, have been killed in violence related to the Shining
Path insurgency.

   A young couple injured in an auto
accident while taking their wedding invitations to the post office
traded vows on schedule in a hospital room, the bride in a surgical
gown trimmed in lace.
   Kim Monzingo, 21, and Mark Woodell, 30, had to abandon plans for
an elaborate church wedding because of the accident April 2, which
left the bride-to-be with her legs in traction and one arm in a
cast. Woodell received stitches above his eye and on his chin.
   The two were wed Saturday.
   ``That's the date we had set since November. We just decided to
go ahead and have it since I was in the hospital,'' the new Mrs.
Woodell by telephone said from her room in St. Elizabeth's Hospital
after the ceremony Saturday.
   ``I didn't get to wear my dress. We just hung it in the room so
I could look at it,'' she added.
   Her parents, Noel and Gloria Monzingo of Jasper, hung a ``Just
Married'' sign and white streamers on the door, and Mrs. Monzingo
sewed lace and tiny beads on her daughter's hospital gown.
   The couple's planned Cayman Islands honeymoon will have to wait
until Mrs. Woodell recovers. She expects to spend three more weeks
in the hospital and must undergo therapy to walk again.
   Woodell built wheelchair ramps at their future home in Jasper
and rides a motorcycle to visit his wife each day.
   ``If I wanted to know before the ceremony what kind of man I was
marrying,'' Mrs. Woodell said, ``well, that's one thing for sure
that I know now.''

   An attack jet doing a loop maneuver
crashed in front of an estimated 150,000 spectators Sunday during
an air show at the Marine Corps Air Station here, critically
injuring the pilot, base officials said.
   The F-A-18 Hornet flown by Col. Jerry Cadick, 45, of Evansville,
Ind., went down in a grassy area about 1,000 yards from the stands,
between a taxiway and a runway, officials said. It did not explode,
said Lt. Shawn Cooper, a base spokeswoman.
   Cadick was in critical condition at Mission Hospital Regional
Medical Center in Mission Viejo, 50 miles southeast of Los Angeles,
said Cpl. Kent Fletcher, a base spokesman. The 38th annual show was
immediately canceled.
   Don Rubin told Los Angeles radio station KNX he saw the crash
from his home near the base.
   ``I saw the F-18 going straight up,'' he said. ``(It) did a loop
over the top of the air station and then came down and as it went
over the grandstand it was very, very low, and it tried to pull up,
but it was just too low.''
   `The back of the tail hit the runway, and it had just flattened
right out,'' Ruben said. ``Fire came out the back end, and foam
truck then went out. ... The plane didn't blow up or catch total
fire.''

   Socialist President Francois Mitterrand won the
first round of the presidential election Sunday setting up a May 8
runoff with conservative Premier Jacques Chirac who finished a
distant second.
   With 98 percent of the ballots counted, and with tabulating
suspended for the day, Mitterrand had 34 percent of the vote in his
quest for a second seven-year term. Chirac, 55, had 19.9 percent.
   Former center-right Premier Raymond Barre, 64, finished third
with 16.5 percent. He conceded defeat and called on his supporters
to back fellow conservative Chirac and oust Mitterrand.
   Making a strong showing in the field of nine candidates was
Jean-Marie Le Pen, 59, leader of the extreme right National Front,
with 14.5 percent. Le Pen campaigned on a tough anti-immigration
platform.
   The big loser was Communist Party candidate Andre Lajoinie,
whose 6.8 percent showing was the lowest in the history of the
party that has been on a steady decline since 1981.
   Turnout in the election was estimated at 82 percent, compared to
81 percent in the first round of the 1981 elections.
   The 71-year-old Mitterrand, whose popularity sank to
unprecedented lows at mid-term only to soar in the last two years,
in two weeks will face the hard-driving premier who has run the
government since conservatives won the 1986 legislative elections.
   ``Now, the choice is simple,'' Mitterrand said in a brief
statement. ``To all of you who serve France, we have before us
great tasks. Frenchwomen and Frenchmen, let us rally together,
neglecting no effort to win May 8.''
   Chirac, in a joint appearance with Barre at the Senate building,
called on unity among conservatives to unseat Mitterrand.
   ``Now, against the Socialist candidate, we must rally
together,'' he said.
   Mitterrand organizers were jubilant as the returns rolled in.
   ``By placing Francois Mitterrand well in front in the first
round, the voters have shown the direction for rallying the country
on May 8,'' said Pierre Beregovoy, Mitterrand's campaign manager.
   ``Mr. Jacques Chirac is far behind,'' said Beregovoy. ``His
policy has left many people unhappy and disappointed.''
   The final polls a week ago had showed Mitterrand defeating
Chirac by a comfortable margin in the second round.
   The president is the chief of state. The premier, elected by the
legislature, is the head of government.
   Sunday's vote marked the first time a president and premier have
opposed one another in a presidential election. The French have
called the unusual governing arrangement ``cohabitation.''
   The polling was something of a test for the National Front,
which has emerged as a major political factor in the past four
years. Le Pen was hoping to solidify the gains of his party and its
anti-immigrant and law-and-order stands.
   Le Pen, who said he would announce his stand on the runoff
during a political rally on May 1, was elated with his tally Sunday.
   ``We have the certainty of a political earthquake and a radical
transformation of the national landscape,'' he said. ``Nothing will
ever be done in France without the voters of the National Front.''
   Otherwise, the campaign had contained little real political
debate. The absence of major differences on the main issues turned
the election into a contest of personalities.
   Unlike 1981, when voters faced a clear right-left choice between
Mitterrand and Valery Giscard d'Estaing, this election was more
subtle. Mitterrand abandoned revolutionary rhetoric of earlier
years for mainstream themes in an effort to broaden appeal.
   Chirac also pledged to open his government to a wider range of
ideas.
   The two first-round leaders now have two more weeks to convince
the voters. Mitterrand will be seeking Communist and other extreme
left votes, as well as nibbling at the center. Chirac will be
fighting for his share of the center and the extreme right.
   Rounding out the nine-candidate field was Antoine Waechter, 39,
an ecologist, with 3.8 percent; Pierre Juquin, 58, leader of a
splinter Communist reformist group, 2.1 percent; Arlette Laguiller,
48, head of the Trotskyist Worker Struggle movement, 2 percent, and
Pierre Boussel, 67, leader of the Movement for a Party of Workers,
0.4 percent.

   Minority students occupying the
dean's office at Williams College in a push for changes in
curriculum and recruiting reported progress toward ending the
standoff after meeting with administrators Sunday.
   President Francis Oakley, Dean Stephen Fix and Provost Neil
Grabois met for two hours with about 15 students in a building
adjacent to Jenness House, where the sit-in began Friday morning.
The office was held Saturday by about 30 students.
   ``They're responsive to us,'' said one of the student
negotiators, Monique Waddell, 19, a sophomore from New York City.
``The meeting is showing some progress.''
   School spokesman Jim Kolesar called the discussions
``constructive.''
   The two sides discussed the first three of the students' 13
demands: full scholarships for low-income minority students from
urban areas, a campus cultural center for minorities and a special
assistant to the president to recruit more minority teachers.
   The two sides met again in the evening and planned to reconvene
Sunday night.
   Minorities account for 13 percent of the 2,000-member student
body and about 10 percent of the 278-member faculty.
   The protesters also have demanded more of a minority perspective
in the curriculum.
   During the negotiations, a young white man was seen taping a
sign saying ``Quality, Not Quotas'' on a window at Jenness, with
the words facing inside the building.
   Freshman Jillian Charles, one of about 10 students who spent
Saturday night inside the Jenness House, said she heard rocks being
thrown at the building. About 20 students joined the sit-in during
the day.
   The protest occurred during Parents' Weekend, and although some
parents expressed concern about or support for the protest, they
were largely undisturbed by it, said Ellen Berek, a spokeswoman for
the schoo.
   Jenness House is tucked to one side of the campus.
   The school, founded 215 years ago, was ranked as the country's
best liberal arts college in 1987 for the second consecutive time
in a survey of 92 college presidents taken in alternate years for
U.S. News & World Report.

   National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen staked his
claim to France's future after his far-right views attracted
thousands of voters in Sunday's first round of the presidential
election.
   Le Pen drew 14.5 percent of the vote with 98 percent of the
ballots counted and led all nine candidates in Marseille, his
southern stronghold and France's third-largest city.
   Le Pen said his followers could decide the outcome of the May 8
runoff between Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, who
finished first in Sunday's balloting, and conservative Premier
Jacques Chirac, the runnerup.
   ``Nothing will ever again be done in France without the voters
of the National Front,'' Le Pen said on national television.
   ``We have the certainty of a political earthquake and a radical
transformation of the national landscape.''
   Running on an anti-immigration platform that asked voters to
choose between a ``French France'' and a ``Third World France,'' Le
Pen ran better than polls had predicted, making the National Front
the strongest extreme-right party in Europe.
   He said he would announce the National Front's voting strategy
on May 1 during a demonstration to honor Joan of Arc.
   Le Pen, 59, who announced his candidacy a year ago, portrayed
himself as an outsider with a chance to finish among the top two
candidates in the election's first round.
   But throughout the campaign he emphasized his potential to sway
the outcome of the final round.
   His campaign against immigration forced other candidates to
address the delicate issue, sometimes at their expense.
   Officials of Chirac's Rally for the Republic party have been
conferring with the National Front in search of an accord for the
second round, according to French press reports.
   National Front Secretary-General Jean-Pierre Stirbois said his
party will be ``very attentive'' to what Chirac has to propose on
immigration and the death penalty. The National Front wants the
death penalty restored.
   Le Pen has said he would not be willing to accept a ministerial
post, saying only the presidency or the premiership ``will show the
French that things have truly changed.''
   ``If the vote confirms the tendency indicated by the polls, in
the future it will be difficult to speak of the National Front as
an ephemeral extreme right current,'' Le Monde newspaper wrote in
its Saturday edition.
   Le Pen, a white-haired Breton and former paratrooper, founded
the National Front in 1974. But the group remained on the political
fringe for years.
   It entered national legislative elections in 1986 and now holds
33 of the 577 National Assembly seats.

   A student of street culture says gang members
rounded up in police sweeps against gang violence probably consider
their arrests a badge of honor.
   Police have arrested about 4,000 people in sweeps between Feb.
26 and Thursday, of which about 2,000 have been identified as gang
members or associates, police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said
Sunday.
   Gang members caught in a sweep probably will brag about the
experience and make being caught ``a way of getting esteem and
prestige,'' said Diego Vigil, a University of Southern California
anthropologist and author of the book ``Barrio Gangs: Street Life
and Identity in Southern California.''
   In a recent interview, Vigil said gang members ``wind up looking
on it (an arrest) as an adventure. It gives them something to talk
about when they get out.''
   Assistant Police Chief Robert Vernon, who is supervising the
sweeps, strongly disagreed.
   ``If a `gangbanger' knows that every time he identifies himself
as a gang member he's going to do three or four days in jail, he
stops being overt about it. He doesn't want to go to jail every
weekend. He wants to party and have fun,'' Vernon said.
   Statistics support the effectiveness of the sweeps, Vernon said.
``The sweeps began in late February. In March of this year we had
16 killings, and in March of the prior year there were 26,'' he
said.
   Some observers expressed concern that the crackdown violates
civil rights.
   Attorney R. Samuel Paz, chairman of the Hispanic Advisory
Council to the Police Commission and a Los Angeles ACLU board
member, said the dragnets, which target people wearing gang colors
or other identifying clothing, remind him of the ``zoot suit''
roundups of the 1940s in which Hispanics were arrested largely
because their clothing set them apart from others.
   ``People are willing to say, `Let them stop all the kids.'
That's my real concern,'' Paz said. ``That could be my kid.''
   But Vernon said that some gang violence is caused by gang
members' clothing.
   ``In drive-by shootings, quite often the person they kill
they've never seen before. They shoot at the colors,'' Vernon said.
``They just say, `There's one of them. Get him!'''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Emily'' begins with an unctious Jason toasting
his date, Emily. They have known each other a week. She proposes
marriage and he scrams _ fast.
   In the first of many asides, Lisa Banes as Emily
enthusiastically explains that that is the way she gets out of
relationships without hurting anybody.
   ``Emily'' opened Sunday at the off-Broadway Manhattan Theater
Club. Author Stephen Metcalfe, an associate artist at the Old Globe
Theater in San Diego, has taken a look at the romantic problems of
a liberated, single young woman in New York.
   Lisa Banes is a sensitive yet vigorous actress who was last seen
in New York in ``On the Verge,'' a play about self-sufficient women
of the 19th century. She makes the inconsistent, sometimes
strong-headed and unkind Emily seem adorable.
   Emily, who earns big money on Wall Street, is very interested in
men and sex but never in love before. She falls for Jon, a waiter
and out-of-work actor, a handsome blond from Minnesota.
   Emily's four Wall Street colleagues are ever giving her advice _
contradictory, cynical or silly.
   In the play's funniest scene, she climbs into the audience, from
which she interrupts Jon in his acting class.
   Emily wins Jon. But their apparent growing commitment scares
her, so she proposes. He accepts. But it is not happy ending time
for this liberated young woman.
   Melcalfe makes clear that it is not a difference in salaries
that comes between them or Emily's career ambitions. And he makes
Jon almost miraculously salt-of-the-earth Midwestern, feet on the
ground while able to put his love into romantic words.
   He drops only hints of Emily's problem but spells it out at the
end. Her parents divorced when she was 3, and she never learned
self-esteem or how to love or how to tell somebody her deepest
feelings.
   The well-chosen cast of 10 is directed in lively fashion by
Gerald Gutierrez. Sets around Manhattan, mostly of back-wall
projections, are by Heidi Landesman.
   But, due to author Metcalfe and Miss Banes, at the end of the
play one does not dismiss it as about just another poor little
yuppie girl but instead sighs, ``Poor Emily.''

<HEAD>Dukakis-Jackson Would Defeat Bush, Poll Suggests</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf ``The Time'' to ADD date of Time poll, who

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Michael Dukakis-Jesse Jackson ticket would
defeat a Republican ticket headed by George Bush 47 percent to 42
percent, according to a Time magazine poll released Sunday.
   A ticket of Dukakis and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee would
defeat Bush 49 percent to 39 percent, the poll suggested.
   Gore dropped out of the Democratic presidential race last week.
   The poll of 1,075 voters, conducted over the two days following
Tuesday's New York primary, showed that the Massachusetts governor
was favored 50 percent to 39 percent over the vice president.
   Bush would defeat Jackson by 52 percent to 34 percent, the poll
indicated.
   Asked who would fight the drug problem in the country more
effectively, those polled favored Dukakis over Bush, 45 percent to
30 percent; on helping the homeless, Dukakis was favored 57 percent
to 21 percent.
   Forty-nine percent thought Bush would do a better job dealing
with the Soviet Union, while 32 percent favored Dukakis; Bush held
a 47 percent to 33 percent edge in dealing with problems in the
Middle East.
   The Time poll, conducted Wednesday and Thursday by Yankelovich
Clancy Shulman, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
   Meanwhile, another poll by Newsweek magazine suggested that an
overwhelming majority of black American voters believe Jesse
Jackson should be the vice presidential nominee, if he did not win
the presidential nomination.
   According to the survey, 80 percent of the blacks polled think
Jackson should be the presidential nominee and 70 percent believe
he should be the vice presidential nominee. The poll also indicated
that almost 20 percent of blacks would vote Republican or not vote
at all if Jackson was not on the ticket _ in either the No. 1 or
No. 2 spot.
   The Newsweek poll was conducted by the Gallup Organization,
which interviewed 504 black adults by telephone April 21 and 22.
The margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points, the
magazine said.

   The army lifted a four-day ban Sunday to let
Palestinians travel from the occupied territories into Israel, but
Arabs said soldiers wrecked homes and shops in another bid to
control unrest.
   Israeli solders have killed 173 Palestinian protesters in the
nearly five-month-old uprising against 21 years of Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, according to U.N. figures. An
Israeli soldier and civilian also have been killed.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the Cabinet that 165
Palestinians have died in the uprising, including 147 killed by
soldiers, Israel radio said Sunday. Rabin said 4,900 Palestinians
have been detained since Dec. 8, including 1,700 held in
administrative detention for up to six months without trial.
   Police ordered Arab merchants in Jerusalem to open their stores
at normal hours in a tug-of-war with protest leaders, who are also
trying to dictate when shops may do business.
   ``I am afraid for my life,'' 43-year-old Saleh Sagari said,
explaining why he opened his tiny grocery shop at hours dictated by
the uprising's leaders. ``If I open (during army-ordered hours),
they will burn me down.''
   Police in riot gear delivered the new orders to shopkeepers
along the Street of the Prophets just outside the walled Old City.
Officers on horses kept back curious tourists and passers-by.
   Shopkeepers could be jailed for two years if they defy the
army's instructions, said police spokesman Rafi Levy.
   In the West Bank village of Bet Roch near Hebron, Arab witnesses
said Ahmad Hassan Salim Amar, 23, was killed Saturday when he
defied the army order to halt. The army said it was investigating.
   The army had reported Saturday that another Palestinian was
killed during a protest in the West Bank village of Qabatiya.
   Meanwhile, the socialist Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres adopted on Sunday its platform for the November elections and
said it would submit any agreement for a Middle East peace to
Israeli voters, according to party spokeswoman Michal Cohen.
   The platform also called for Jewish settlements to remain in the
occupied lands. But it said parts of the occupied territories with
a high percentage of Arab residents may be returned to
Jordanian-Palestinian control.
   In addition to lifting the four-day ban Sunday, Israel also
permitted deliveries of gasoline to the occupied areas for the
first time in more than a month.
   It ended a six-day curfew in more than a dozen towns and refugee
camps, also helping thousands of Arab workers reach jobs in Israel,
an army spokesman said. But curfews were extended a seventh day on
three towns on the West Bank and a refugee camp in Gaza.
   The spokesman said the curfew in the Boureij refugee camp was
intended to allow soldiers to destroy buildings which were put up
without permits. Arab reports said the army destroyed eight houses
and four shops and took down stone barricades protesters had
erected on roads.
   The army spokesman would not say what buildings were torn down.
An Associated Press photographer saw a garage, part of a gas
station on the outskirts of Buoreij, reduced to rubble. The owner
said he didn't know why his property was razed.
   The army has destroyed Arab shops and homes during the uprising
in an effort to make life difficult for organizers of the protests
on land that Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East War.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, about 30 police, some in riot helmets
and carrying clubs and automatic rifles, issued orders to
shopkeepers opposite Damascus Gate to stop following instructions
of uprising leaders to open their shops only in the late afternoon.
   Police had ordered about 25 merchants on the street to open all
day Sunday, but merchants defied the order and threw open their
doors only at the hours set by the underground leaders.
   Police spokesman Levy said police orders issued Sunday said that
stores must be closed from late afternoon through early evening
beginning Monday.
   Several shopkeepers said they were confused by the conflicting
orders and uncertain about what to do.
   ``We don't want to open. We don't know what we want to do,''
said Mohammed Aldi, 25, who runs a coffee shop.
   Aldi said he did not know who was issuing the uprising orders.
``They call you on the telephone and tell you what to do. You don't
know who called,'' he said.
   Also Sunday, a military court gave an Israeli soldier, Saguy
Harpaz, a suspended prison term of five months for taking part in
beating two Arab protesters. Saguy was also reduced in rank from
private first class to private.
   The Feb. 25 incident was filmed by CBS television and showed
four soldiers, including Harpaz, beat the Arabs with rocks and
rifle butts for more than half an hour.

   The Communist Party of Britain reorganized Sunday
after dissolving last year in a disagreement over the direction it
should take.
   Delegates from throughout Britain agreed at a congress Sunday
that the newly formed party should operate under the rules that
existed before the party's moderate wing won control in 1985.
   In 1985, the moderate faction won all 45 seats on the executive
committee, routing the pro-Moscow faction and the party collapsed.
   The 150 delegates to Sunday's congress elected an executive
committee of 39, which plans to hold its first meeting May 7.
   Card-carrying membership in the party was 10,350 in November
1987. Founded in 1920, the party had 50,000 members in 1945 but it
has declined steadily and has not had a member in Parliament for 38
years.

   Toxic gas leaked from a chemical plant
Sunday, forcing an estimated 1,800 people in two states from their
homes, officials said.
   William Wright, chief of the McCaysville, Ga., Fire Department,
said some people reported nausea, burning eyes and itchy throats.
   However, James Francis, operations director of the Tennessee
Emergency Management Agency said he had no reports of anyone being
hospitalized.
   A pressure release valve came off a tank at the Tennessee
Chemical Co. about 2 p.m., releasing a cloud of sulfur trioxide,
said Francis. The leak was stopped about 4:40 p.m.
   Francis said that tests at the Georgia and North Carolina
borders at about 10 p.m. showed no traces of the chemical. He said
said he expected the evacuation order to be lifted later Sunday
night.
   Sulfur trioxide is irritating to the skin, eyes and throat and
can cause choking, coughing and severe discomfort, Francis said.
   Copperhill is in upper east Tennessee just across the North
Carolina and Georgia borders.
   Up to 1,000 people were evacuated from McCaysville, Wright said.
Francis said about 600 people were evacuated in Copperhill, 150 in
Newtown and 50 in Coletown.
   Officials at the chemical plant could not immediately be reached
for comment, but Francis said they were meeting with both TEMA
officials and officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.

Israel's yearlong 40th anniversary bash, with American director
Woody Allen, poet Allen Ginsberg and tennis ace Chris Evert among
celebrities who turned down invitations.
   Israeli organizers hope to stem the wave of cancellations by
assuring reluctant guests that the Arab-Israeli conflict will be a
central theme and that they are free to criticize Israel.
   Some Israelis consider the no-shows another slap in the face to

<HEAD>GM Dropping Firestone As Major Tire Supplier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is dropping Firestone
Tire & Rubber Co. as a supplier of tires for new GM cars and
trucks, which account for about 20 percent of Firestone's U.S.
production, the companies said Sunday.
   The unexpected setback comes as Firestone shareholders prepare
to vote Monday on a $2.6 billion buyout offer from Bridgestone
Corp. of Japan, although Firestone said the GM move would not
affect the merger plans.
   Firestone stated that it learned of GM's planned phaseout on
Friday. There was no immediate comment from Bridgestone.
   John J. Nevin, chairman and chief executive of Firestone, said
in a news release he was ``surprised and disappointed'' by GM's
move, but said Firestone was confident it would find other markets
for its tires without hurting profits.
   GM plans to reduce Firestone's role as a supplier significantly
during the second half of this year, and will eliminate the
tiremaker from its supply base over a period of up to two years,
Firestone stated.
   GM spokesman James Crellin said in a telephone interview in
Detroit that the move was part of the automaker's ``ongoing
supplier-rationalization study'' _ a periodic review of suppliers'
capacity and future needs _ and indicated it was not linked to the
impending buyout by Bridgestone.
   ``We've got four other tire suppliers: General Tire, Goodyear,
Michelin and Uniroyal-Goodrich,'' Crellin said. ``There are no
plans to look for another supplier at this time. We will be
informing the other four tire suppliers of the availability of
increased business.''
   Crellin declined to say how long the phaseout would take and
that it was GM's policy not to discuss the amount of business it
does with any suppliers.
   GM's biggest tire supplier is Uniroyal-Goodrich, which supplies
about 34 percent of its tires, according to estimates by the trade
publication Modern Tire Dealer. Goodyear is second at 22.5 percent,
Firestone is third with 20 percent, General Tire was fourth at 17.5
percent and Michelin was fifth at 4.5 percent, according to the
publication.
   Chicago-based Firestone is the nation's second-largest tiremaker
after Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., with tires accounting for nearly
70 percent of its $4.2 billion in annual sales.
   Firestone said it has told Ford Motor Co. of GM's move and was
authorized to say in its news release that Ford has no plans to
change its relationship with Firestone, its fourth-largest tire
supplier.
   Firestone agreed in March to be acquired by Bridgestone for $80
a share after it became the target of an unsolicited offer by
Italy's Pirelli SpA.
   Firestone had agreed in February to sell 75 percent of its
worldwide tire business to Bridgestone for $1.5 billion, but
terminated that venture after Pirelli launched its attempt to
acquire the entire company.
   In agreeing to acquire Firestone, Bridgestone indicated the
merger would help it become a global tiremaker. In addition to its
production and marketing capacity, the Japanese company cited
Firestone's role as an original equipment supplier _ Bridgestone's
weakest area _ to Ford and GM as a rationale for the acquisition.

<HEAD>Weak Dollar Lures European Tourists To South Florida</HEAD>

   European tourists are flocking to South
Florida this year, lured not only by sun, beaches and attractions
such as Disney World but also by a weak dollar that has cut the
cost of such getaways.
   ``Last time I came, the dollar was really high and we lost a lot
of money,'' said Gabriella Heurlin of Sweden, comparing her
family's 1984 trip to the United States with their April visit to
Florida. ``You were always checking money and saying, `My God, how
expensive.' But not this time. Now, you just buy.''
   ``Loads of shopping! We bought hundreds of T-shirts,'' said
Brigitte Haskins of Surrey, England, as she toted stuffed shopping
bags through Miami International Airport to catch a plane home.
   Local resort association executives say that 20,000 brochures
sent to their London tourism office to tout package trips to Miami
Beach were gone in 10 days.
   ``The requests coming in are phenomenal,'' said Murray Gold,
executive director of the Miami Beach Resort Hotel Association.
``We never expected it.''
   Since the dollar started sinking in February 1985, increasing
the buying power of foreign currencies, the United States has
become increasingly attractive as a vacation spot for foreign
tourists.
   In March, the dollar fell to its lowest monthly average since
November 1978 on the Federal Reserve's trade-weighted index of 18
major currencies.
   The state does not track foreign tourism, but Larry Schultz of
the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta said the bank estimated
Florida's foreign tourism increased by between 25 and 30 percent
last year over 1986.
   In the first 11 months of 1987, 34.1 million people vacationed
in Florida, said Chip Coggins of the state division of tourism, up
from 33.7 million in all of 1986. December 1987 figures were not
available.
   Tourism officials here note that although foreign tourists often
travel to attractions like Disney World and Daytona Beach that are
further north, the Miami area _ a key arrival point for
international travel _ is regarded as a primary destination.
   Of the 6.79 million tourists in Dade last year, 418,000 were
European visitors, a 36.6 percent increase over foreign tourism in
1986, said Bill Anderson of the Greater Miami Convention and
Visitors Bureau.
   ``The falling dollar is a major factor,'' Anderson said.
   Tourism pumped $4.9 billion to the county economy last year, and
occupancy rates totaled 71.5 percent for Dade's 56,990 hotel and
motel beds. This year, officials expect a 5 percent to 7 percent
rise in tourism, said Anderson.
   In neighboring Broward County, hoteliers saw a slight increase
over last year, especially among British and West German tourists,
although specific numbers were not available, said Broward tourism
bureau statistician Bruce Laster.
   In Dade County's Miami Beach, local tourism officials hope the
dollar's decline will be their summertime salvation.
   ``Miami Beach has turned a circle and become a hot resort
again,'' said Gold, whose group represents about 150 motels and
hotels. ``For years, we were down in the dumps.''
   Gold's association last year opened an office on Buckingham
Palace Road in London to sell one-week packages with prices
starting at $160, including hotel, a rental car, a one-day cruise
and jai-alai tickets.
   The packages aim to pull in United Kingdom tourists during the
slow season of April 10 to Dec. 15, when blistering daytime heat
and steamy nights drive off winter tourists.
   Some South Florida tourist attractions also are noticing more
foreign accents lately.
   ``I'm hearing French, German and Japanese everywhere,'' said
Michael Finley, superintendent of the 1.4 million-acre Everglades
National Park. He said he expects Europeans to account for about 80
percent of summer business at the park's Flamingo Lodge.

<HEAD>Texas Air Management Engaged In Its Own Media Barrage</HEAD>

   The protracted labor strife at Texas Air Corp. has
given way to a publicity battle that the company portrays as a
counter-attack to a well-orchestrated union campaign of negative
publicity.
   Texas Air and its Eastern Airlines unit have been blaming
agitation by labor leaders at Eastern for recent critical scrutiny
and investigations by lawmakers, the news media and political
candidates.
   ``It has been a very well-orchestrated campaign, and with the
political environment and the pressure on the FAA (over increased
passenger complaints and safety concerns industrywide), we were a
perfect target,'' said Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak in Miami.
   Houston-based Texas Air has responded with ads in national
newspapers, news conferences, special mailings to travel agents and
an unusually high profile by chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   The negative publicity may have peaked earlier this month with
the Federal Aviation Administration's announcement of an
unprecedented investigation of Texas Air's finances and management,
and a concurrent safety inspections of its Eastern and Continental
Airlines fleets.
   The company apparently was stunned by the wide publicity given
the union leadership's long-time claims that Lorenzo was out to
bust the unions, cannibalize Eastern's assets, and pressure
employees into ignoring safety problems.
   ``In some cases, the unions' issues and allegations just made
good copy,'' said Texas Air spokesman Bruce Hicks, in Houston.
``And you've certainly got a very political year.''
   Democratic presidental candidates Michael Dukakis, Richard
Gephardt and Al Gore Jr. all have spoken out against Eastern
management, which also has been the topic of critical congressional
hearings.
   Eastern pilots last year launched a ``MaxSafety'' campaign, in
which pilots sent anonymous postcards detailing safety problems to
the FAA. Eastern's machinists and flight attendants unions also
repeatedly have alleged that Eastern management has been reducing
safety measures taken by the company.
   Their claims and examples have been the subject of national
magazine, newspaper and television network news stories on Eastern
safety and management.
   After the FAA announcement, Eastern President Phil Bakes, who in
previous weeks had been declining interview requests, immediately
held a news conference in Miami.
   Lorenzo, who rarely talks to reporters, appeared on NBC's ``Meet
The Press'' and then, joined by Bakes, former Eastern chairman
Frank Borman and other officials, gave a packed news conference in
Washington on April 18.
   The day after the FAA announcement, Eastern took out full-page
ads in most major markets saying it welcomed the inspection as a
chance to disprove the charges about safety problems.
   Charles E. Bryan, Eastern Machinists union president, said: ``We
are absolutely being truthful.'' He said the federal inspection of
Eastern has been ``a whitewash'' and that Eastern employees have
been intimidated against giving FAA inspectors proof of safety
problems.
   Texas Air also has run full-page ads reprinting a favorable New
York Times editorial and detailing management's position that
Eastern's unions must accept cuts _ Bakes wants to reduce labor
costs by 30 percent _ to turn around its financial losses.
   Hicks didn't have figures on how much the company has spent on
such publicity.
   Eastern's traffic dipped slightly in the first few days after
the FAA inspection began, but officials said there has been no
major drop-off.
   Paula Musto, an Eastern marketing spokeswoman, said travel
agents had been supportive but the company has taken additional
steps to send out detailed information rebutting union allegations,
including a special edition of its newsletter to travel agents.
   Barry White, who runs a Miami travel agency, said: ``I think any
travel agent who knows the business knows there's a lot of
propaganda going on. I'm confident about Eastern's safety, and I
don't pay much attention to all the propaganda.''
