   Congress on Friday approved a $3.2 billion
budget for the District of Columbia after attaching a strong
anti-abortion amendment and a measure allowing Georgetown
University to deny certain rights to gay groups, prompting a threat
by city officials to shut down the local government.
   ``I'm not sure the outcome is in the best interests of this
body, the District of Columbia, or the country,'' Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, said as the Senate approved the budget late Friday night.
``In the way the district spends its own money, the Congress need
not be intervening.''
   The bill was sent to President Reagan for his signature less
than an hour before midnight, when the new fiscal year began.
   In approving the city's $3.2 billion fiscal year 1989 budget,
the House and Senate added an amendment that would freeze the $537
million federal payment for the District's budget and prevent the
city from spending its own money if Medicaid-funded abortions are
performed on women whose lives are not threatened.
   The spending bill also would allow Georgetown University to go
back on its agreement to allow gay student associations to meet on
campus and apply for student government funds.
   The Roman Catholic school had reached an agreement with the gay
groups in March after the District of Columbia Superior Court and
Court of Appeals upheld a finding by the city's human rights office
that Georgetown was discriminating against gay groups. Georgetown
officials have said that they will not go back on their agreement
with the student groups, regardless of what Congress decided.
   Walter Fauntroy, the non-voting Democratic delegate to Congress
from the District, was angered by the intrusion into local affairs
and said he would encourage city officials to disobey the
abortion-funding prohibition to trigger a congressionally mandated
shutdown of city government. Such a move would leave Congress with
the responsibility of governing the nation's capital.
   ``You will forgive me, having respected you for 18 years, if I
suggest to my mayor and people that work for this (city) government
that maybe it's time to end this facade,'' a tearful Fauntroy told
his House colleagues in a meeting where the final touches were put
on the budget. ``If Congress wants to decide every little detail,
maybe it's time to do that.''
   David Clarke, chairman of the District of Columbia Council,
concurred with Fauntroy, saying, ``I believe it is time for the
people of the District of Columbia to take to the streets to defend
their constitutional rights.''
   The abortion measure, offered by Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif.,
toughens current legislation, which allows the city to use locally
generated funds for abortions, and restricts federal funds for use
by rape and incest victims, women suffering through ectopic
pregnancies, or when the mother's life is threatened.

   Alarmed by outbursts of
anti-Americanism during the Olympics, South Korean officials are
trying to defuse the criticism and halt growing admiration for the
Soviet Union.
   President Roh Tae-woo and other top officials Thursday called on
South Koreans to stop criticizing the United States for a series of
incidents during the Games and to remember the nations' close ties.
   ``We should not let one-time feelings damage the traditionally
friendly relations between the United States and our nation,'' said
Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae.
   The anti-American sentiment was sparked by the behavior of some
U.S. athletes during the Olympics and U.S. media coverage of the
Games.
   South Koreans have pointed to the unruly behavior of the U.S.
team at the Games' opening ceremony and to what they called the
``rude and arrogant'' manner of many Americans. They expressed
resentment that the American media didn't play up the arrest of two
U.S. Olympic swimmers for removing a lion's head ornament from a
Seoul hotel lobby.
   Some Koreans also complain that their main ally is unwilling to
recognize South Korea's achievements.
   South Korean newspapers and television networks bristled with
angry denounciations of the NBC television network for playing up a
boxing incident last week in which South Korean boxing officials
attacked a referee who awarded a match against a local favorite.
   Some commentators said NBC and other U.S. media covered the
brawl to embarrass the Olympic host nation, claiming the Americans
had organized a conspiracy against the South Korean boxers.
   But President Roh defended NBC coverage, saying, ``Even if the
reports of NBC included something that hurt our self-esteem, we
should put up with it, since most of the network's reports were
affirmative.''
   The anti-American outbursts have been confined to the press and
popular opinion and there has been no apparent impact on relations,
but leaders warned the anti-American sentiment could endanger South
Korea's interests.
   The vehemently anti-communist officials, who initially played a
role in criticizing American behavior, became alarmed when South
Koreans showed a growing public interest in the Soviet Union _ one
of Seoul's main enemies in the past.
   Citizens seemed enraptured by their first encounter with Soviet
athletes and officials _ Soviet ballet and cultural offerings
during the Olympics sold out, Soviet goods disappeared in minutes
at stores and Soviet athletes were praised for their dignified
conduct.
   ``The spread of anti-U.S. and pro-Soviet sentiment may have a
serious impact on relations between South Korea and the United
States,'' said Yoon Giel-joong, chairman of the government's
Democratic Justice Party.
   Government officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
it was hard to believe South Koreans would admire the Soviet Union,
a long-hated enemy that shot down a South Korean jetliner in 1983.
   ``We should think seriously about what kind of country it was to
us in the past,'' said government spokesman Kim Zoong-wie Kim, who
reminded his countrymen that the Soviet Union backed North Korea
during the Korean war in the 1950s and was still the North's main
ally.
   Worried government officials also reminded Koreans that the
United States still has 42,000 troops in the country under a mutual
defense treaty and is Seoul's main market and vital to its
continued prosperity.
   ``It would be just like cutting off our own feet if Korea
destroys its trade with the United States,'' The Korea Economic
Daily said.
   ``This is the time to confirm once again that U.S.-Korean
relations are so valuable that they cannot be ruined carelessly,''
the newspaper added.

   The United Nations, scorned for years as
too weak and politicized to forge peace, is on a comeback and
enjoying new respectability for its peacemaking successes in
Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf.
   Its renaissance and its expanding role in the international
arena were crowned on Thursday with the award of the Nobel Peace
Prize for 40 years of peacekeeping.
   For nearly eight years, Washington rebuked the U.N., accusing it
of anti-Western bias and bureaucracy and punished it with a
crippling withholding of U.S. dues.
   But for the past six months, the United Nations has been on a
roll, toting up success after success in conflict resolution, with
more to come. The award to the 10,000 soldiers in the U.N.
peacekeeping forces is the latest praise lavished on the world body.
   U.N. achievements include an Iran-Iraq cease-fire; an agreement
on Afghanistan; peace plans for southern Africa, Western Sahara and
Cambodia, and arranging talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
   And this week, the Reagan administration made up with the United
Nations, praising its work, paying some long overdue debts and
promising to pay up everything owed eventually.
   The belated, limited U.S. donation will help, but not solve U.N.
funding problems or finance the shopping list of new peacekeeping
forces, observers, election monitors and other peacemakers being
envisioned.
   President Reagan conceded Monday in his seventh and final
address to the General Assembly that ``Yes, the United Nations is a
better place than it was eight years ago, but so, too, is the world
...
   ``We see not only progress but also the potential for an
increasingly vital role for multilateral efforts and institutions
like the United Nations.''
   While giving high marks to patient U.N. diplomacy, most
observers attribute its achievements to improved East-West
relations and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's desire to
extricate his country from regional conflicts involving Soviet
troops and proxies.
   The latest U.N. victory came Aug. 20 after Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar arranged a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq
and deployed 1,500 peacekeepers, observers and support personnel.
   The U.N. chief is conducting further talks with Iran and Iraq,
trying to consolidate the cease-fire and reach a lasting peace.
Those talks appear likely to continue for a year or more.
   The U.N. success story began April 13 with the signing of the
Afghanistan agreement, providing for withdrawal of more than
100,000 Soviet troops. It was negotiated over seven years of U.N.
mediation, about 50 unarmed U.N. observers were deployed to monitor
the pullout and investigate violations.
   In southern Africa, a 10-year-old U.N. independence plan for
South-West Africa, or Namibia, is to be put into effect in November
as part of a peace agreement among South Africa, Angola and Cuba.
At least 7,000 U.N. peacekeepers are likely to be required there.
   In the Western Sahara, representatives of Morocco and the
Polisario independence movement accepted a U.N. peace plan calling
for elections in the region.
   In Southeast Asia, the secretary-general has proposed a peace
plan and talks are under way among the Cambodian and Vietnamese
factions.
   Most diplomatic observers expect that a U.N. peacekeeping force
will be needed in Cambodia to monitor an eventual Vietnamese troop
withdrawal and to supervise elections.
   On the Cyprus problem, the secretary-general brought
representatives of Greek and Turkish communities together for the
first time in three years in Geneva last month and further talks
about the divided island are plannned.
   ``The recent achievements of the United Nations have neither
been sudden nor fortuitious,'' Perez de Cuellar said Thursday in a
statement to the General Assembly about the Nobel Prize.
   ``They are the hard-won results of persistence and dedication
over many years, epitomized by the peacekeeping activities of the
organization.''
   In his annual work report this month he said: ``Considering the
vast sweep and scope of the possibilities now opening for
constructive multilateral action through the United Nations, the
financial health of the organization needs to be immediately
restored.''
   He said the United Nations is still seriously short of cash and
reserves and without reserves it cannot mount new peacekeeping
operations.
   The present peacekeeping cost is $230 million a year and new
operations are expected to raise the total annual bill to $1.5
billion to $2 billion.
   Member states owe a total of about $484 million in peacekeeping
arrears, including about $70 million owed by the United States.
   The arrears in the regular budget total about $593 million, with
the United States _ the largest contributor and debtor _ owing
about $452 million of that. Washington promised to pay $188 million
by the end of November and pay back the rest of its back dues over
several years.
   About 100 of the 159 U.N. member states also are in arrears.
   ``It would be paradoxical and discordant,'' Perez de Cuellar
said, ``if the organization should face financial difficulties
precisely when it has to meet the demands of a more constructive
phase of international affairs.''

<DATELINE>WHITTIER, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after the brunt of a violent
earthquake hit this quiet Los Angeles suburb, vacant lots gape,
many shops remain boarded up and homes are still undergoing repairs.
   Business operators and homeowners complain about the difficulty
of getting loans to rebuild, and at the same time, earthquake
repairs have generated business for some.
   The quake struck at 7:42 a.m. Oct. 1, 1987, unleashed by a fault
lurking 46,000 feet beneath Whittier Narrows, a flood control area
10 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
   Measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale, the shock spread scattered
damage across more than 100 square miles. But the greatest
concentration of destruction was just to the south of the epicenter
in the quaint Uptown business district of Whittier, former
President Richard Nixon's boyhood home, and surrounding
neighborhoods.
   Brick stores collapsed, windows showered sidewalks and roofs
fell in. Walls split, and street lights and merchandise crashed to
the ground.
   The tremor and a 5.3-magnitude aftershock three days later
caused $358 million in damage throughout metropolitan Los Angeles,
killed eight people and injured 200.
   There were no deaths and few injuries among Whittier's 71,000
residents, but damage was severe enough to ensure that recovery
will be a long process.
   ``It's going to take an estimated 10 to 20 years before the
majority of the areas are rebuilt,'' said Sonny Morkus, city
emergency services coordinator and director of personnel.
   The town's structural damage amounted to $71 million. In all,
4,762 buildings were damaged, including 80 businesses and more than
300 residential units that had to be shuttered because they were
hazardous.
   About 36 of those 300 residences were razed and more may be,
Morkus said. Thirty of the businesses have been demolished and
others are awaiting the wrecker's ball, including a supermarket, a
theater and multistory department store.
   ``We're concerned about leaving them there, because we are in
earthquake country,'' he said.
   Throughout Uptown, signs posted on empty lots and fences give
addresses for relocated businesses, offer to lease, or announce
``Rebuilding At This Site.'' Atop one shattered building, a stopped
clock declares: ``Time To Invest.''
   ``There's a lot of frustration,'' said Mimi Campion, 24, working
behind a counter in a temporary trailer where the family business,
Uptown Mail & Parcel Services, reopened a month after the quake
shattered its store.
   ``We're way down. The only big period we had was Christmas, but
even that was down 30 percent,'' she said.
   The trailer is among a dozen that the city allowed to be set up
in parking lots. Some are vacant now, but it will be months before
they all are empty. The parcel service hopes to open in a new
building in March.
   After the quake, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
state Office of Emergency Services set up centers for victims to
apply for aid, including low-interest loans from the Small Business
Administration. But there's a common feeling that loans aren't as
forthcoming as victims had expected.
   ``The SBA loans are what's fouling it up,'' Ms. Campion said.
``A lot of people aren't getting financed.''
   Ironically, interior designer Paulette Adams has seen her
business grow 30 percent since the quake, partly from people
redoing their homes because they were damaged.
   But she said government red tape kept her from getting any
federal help for the damage to her own home and business. She
credits loyal customers, understanding creditors, good neighbors,
hard work and God for putting her back in business after a
three-month shutdown.
   Ms. Adams said she got a grant of several thousand dollars from
the city, but the SBA would not loan her any amount. Her accountant
estimated that producing the paperwork to get a federal loan would
have cost at least $2,000, she said.
   ``I just said, anything. They said, `We don't care. You don't
have any income coming in,''' Ms. Adams said.
   ``I'm totally frustrated with them. ... The people who got money
had money,'' she said. ``The red tape was unbelievable.''
   George Camp, SBA deputy district director in Sacramento, took
issue with assertions that the vacant lots remaining in the city
are the result of rejected SBA applications.
   ``We do have to establish a reasonable assurance that the loan
can be repayed,'' he said.
   The SBA approved 8,400 loan applications in the region for
damage stemming from the quake, for a total of $149.6 million, Camp
said. The average was around $18,000.

   The Italian film company that produced the
Oscar-winning movie ``The Last Emperor'' is at work on a new film
portraying a detective drama about China's 7th century master
sleuth, Judge Di.
   Italian producer Franco Giovale of RVC Productions, who also
made the ``Marco Polo'' television series, signed a contract in
Aug. 1987 with the China Film Coproduction Corp., said Ann Roddy, a
production assistant for the project, in a recent interview.
   Judge Di combines elements of James Bond and Sherlock Holmes as
he braves China's remote and treacherous landscape to solve
baffling crimes in a world of bandits, prostitutes, monks and cult
worshippers.
   The Tang dynasty detective was popularized in the West by Dutch
sinologist Robert Van Gulik through his series of Judge Di novels.
   No director or filming schedule has been announced for the film.
``The Last Emperor,'' directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, took five
years to make.

   A West German state court has
rejected a lawsuit from ecologists on behalf of thousands of seals
that have died in the country's North Sea waters, an environmental
group said.
   Ecologists, in a lawsuit titled ``in the name of the seals,''
had called for a ban on dumping industrial wastes in the North Sea,
a spokeswoman for the Greenpeace environmental group said Thursday.
   Greenpeace and other ecologists say a massive epidemic that is
killing off North Sea seals by the thousands was caused by
pollution, a theory that some independent scientists dispute.
   An administrative court in the West German city-state of Hamburg
rejected the lawsuit on behalf of the seals, spokeswoman Ingrid
Juetting of the Hamburg-based West German chapter of Greenpeace
said.
   The court requested proof of a causal connection between North
Sea pollution and mass seal deaths, Ms. Juetting said.
   ``The court is requesting evidence that has long since been
scientifically proven,'' Ms. Juetting said, adding that the
environmentalists will continue the legal battle.
   Seven environmental groups besides Greenpeace, including the
international World Wildlife Fund, were responsible for the
lawsuit, Ms. Juetting said.
   At least 7,000 harbor seals are estimated to have died in the
North Sea since April, more than 2,000 of them in West German North
Sea waters alone.

<TEXT>
   President Raul Alfonsin, the
civilian who won office on a wave of popularity in 1983 after
nearly eight years of military rule, is seeing his support erode
under an onslaught of inflation and unemployment.
   Eroding, too, is support for his Radical Civil Union, which must
face the Peronists in a presidential election in eight months.
   Inflation in August exceeded 25 percent for the second month in
a row.
   Argentines have seen the value of their currency, the austral,
plunge from $1.20 in 1985 to 7 cents now.
   Personal incomes have declined by 20 percent or more in the past
12 months, according to private estimates.
   Unemployment and underemployment at a combined 14 percent are
the highest since 1974.
   ``Every day, there's less work, and my family can't live on what
I earn,'' said Daniel Rio, a truck driver.
   ``We make $200 a month,'' said 33-year-old school teacher Alicia
Lupo, converting her austral salary into dollars. ``We want the
government to spend more on education and pay higher salaries.''
Several colleagues nearby nodded in agreement.
   Tensions were vented dramatically Sept. 9 when fighting broke
out among 20,000 people demonstrating against austerity measures
imposed by Alfonsin's government. Riot police used tear gas and
water cannons to restore order. More than 130 people were injured.
   More and more, Argentines are blaming their misfortunes on
Alfonsin, who until recently appeared immune from the criticism
aimed at members of his Cabinet.
   The 61-year-old president was booed when he inaugurated the
nation's annual livestock fair in August. Shouting above his
hecklers, an angered Alfonsin decried their ``fascist attitudes.''
   Hardly a week goes by that some group _ doctors, nurses,
teachers, mail carriers, train engineers _ does not strike to
demand pay increases. The 3.5-million-member General Labor
Confederation staged general strikes on Sept. 9 and 12.
   The first was to protest ``the hunger and misery the government
is trying to impose on us,'' said Saul Ubaldini, the
confederation's leader. The second, he said, was to denounce ``the
unusual and ferocious attack'' on demonstrators by riot police at
the first.
   Argentines of all classes have had to make concessions. They
wash clothes at home instead of sending them to the cleaners. The
customary weekly movie and dinner out have become biweekly. People
take buses and the subway instead of taxis.
   That irritates taxi driver Juan de la Larramendi.
   ``The Alfonsin government is the worst I've seen,'' he said.
``He says everything is OK, but it's not. Nobody has any money. How
can they take a cab? I guess my business is off 40 percent since
last year.''
   Prices have risen 20 to 30 percent in the past month. Beefsteak,
always cheap in this cattle-raising and agricultural nation, has
risen to the equivalent of $1 a pound. A quart of milk is up to 64
cents, a movie ticket to $1.65, and a bus token to 17 cents.
   The monthly minimum wage is 924 australs ($66). A secretary
might earn the equivalent of $150 a month, an engineer $400, a
bilingual college graduate with a degree in business administration
$500 and a tenured university professor $600 to $700 a month.
   Many Argentines have taken second jobs, and shoppers are buying
cheaper cuts of meat. Some buy lentils instead of meat and more
flour to bake bread and cookies at home.
   Ovidio Bolo, president of the Argentine Chamber of Supermarkets,
said total sales at member stores have dropped 10 to 15 percent
since July. New car sales dropped 15 percent in August, according
to the Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
   Many Argentines line up on pay day at banks and foreign exchange
houses to buy U.S. dollars or certificates of deposit (CDs) as
hedges against inflation. In July, banks offered one-month CDs with
a 27-percent interest rate.
   With an eye to the national elections set for May, Alfonsin
devalued the austral in August to spur exports and discourage
imports and financial speculation. He also implemented voluntary
wage and price controls, cut government spending and made plans to
borrow abroad.
   The government currently is negotiating with international
lending institutions for $5 billion to finance development projects
or structural reforms, and to help pay interest on Argentina's $56
billion foreign debt through the end of 1989.
   Preliminary results from the anti-inflation plan have been
positive. Short-term interest rates have declined, the austral has
stabilized against the dollar, and prices appear to be increasing
less rapidly.
   But organized labor and the opposition Peronist Party say the
measures are forcing workers to bear the brunt of the hardship by
accepting reduced purchasing power, or being laid off.
   Union leader Ubaldini said high unemployment ``is not a natural
cataclysm that is impossible to predict or control, it is the fruit
of a perverse socio-economic policy that benefits financial
interests and speculators ahead of the common good, the dignity of
man and the necessities of the family.''
   No independent polls have been published as yet on how voters
feel about the presidential candidates _ the Radical Civic Union's
Eduardo Angeloz and the Peronists' Carlos Menem, two provincial
governors nominated in July.
   But the trend appears to favor the Peronists.
   Votes for the Radicals dropped from to 5.9 million in
congressional and provincial elections in September, 1987, from 7.1
million in the national elections that sent Alfonsin to the
presidency in 1983.
   Votes for the Peronists, who now control 17 of Argentina's 22
provinces, increased to 6.6 million last year from 5.7 million in
1983.

   The Soviet Union has been working
quietly during the Olympics to create a good image in this strongly
anti-communist nation.
   The Soviets got an early start in their publicity campaign when
they sent the Bolshoi Ballet, the Moscow Philharmonic and an ethnic
Korean singer to Seoul to perform in a cultural festival that
preceded the sports competitions.
   The performances were followed by Nelli Kim, the former Soviet
gymnastic star of Korean descent, who came with the Soviet athletes
as a goodwill ambassador and gymnastics judge.
   Kim and some other ethnic Koreans who were allowed to visit
South Korea for the first time were received with open arms.
   The Soviet Union and South Korea have no formal diplomatic or
trade relations, so the novelty of Soviet visitors fanned the
public's interest.
   Korean television devoted segments of nightly newscasts to the
Soviets, showing Kim's activities, interviews with a correspondent
of the official Communist Party newspaper Pravda and a visit to ``a
typical Korean family'' by reporters of the Tass Soviet news agency.
   At a preliminary Olympic soccer match between the United States
and the Soviet Union last week, some Koreans cheered for the Soviet
side, waving huge hammer-and-sickle red flags _ a scene almost
impossible to imagine only a few months ago.
   Koreans also held up signs reading ``CCCP'' _ the Russian
letters for USSR _during the men's basketball game between the
Soviet Union and the United States on Wednesday. The Soviets upset
the Americans 82-76.
   Korean media have mentioned a strong possibility of expanding
cultural and commercial exchanges with the Soviet Union.
   But despite the new developments, relations between the South
Korean government and the Soviet Union are likely to remain cool
because Moscow supports communist North Korea.
   In addition, South Korea remains a firm ally of the United
States, which supported in the war with the North in the 1950s that
divided the Korean Peninsula. About 42,000 American troops are
stationed in the South.

   Jason Robertson grabbed his new
backpack and walked into a new school Thursday, past protesting
parents who don't want a student with AIDS-related complex
attending classes with their children.
   Despite the placard-waving demonstrators, the 8-year-old had a
good start, said his mother, Tammie Robertson. School officials had
suggested that her son enter school by a side door.
   ``I insisted on walking right down the sidewalk, right in
front,'' Mrs. Robertson said. ``He's going to go like a normal kid.
I just felt he had to.''
   Wearing a fresh set of clothes and shoes, Jason was met by a
pack of reporters when he arrived to start second grade.
   The Robertsons moved to Roxana last month from Granite City, 15
miles north, where Jason went to court to win the right to attend a
public school.
   Jason suffers from AIDS-related complex, a disease that often
precedes a full case of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which
is fatal.
   ``Things went very smoothly,'' Superintendent Charles Conner
said. ``We're going about our business of teaching children.''
   Conner said the youngster seemed ``somewhat bewildered'' by all
the attention, but Mrs. Robertson says her son handles it ``better
than I do.''
   Conner said at least 47 of the 358 pupils at South Roxana
Elementary School were absent Thursday. Seven absences were for
legitimate medical reasons, but the rest were probably linked to
parents' concerns about Jason, he said.
   ``They're going to have some time to think through their
situation clearly, to speak to some people that they have
confidence in, giving them advice,'' he said.
   The district has tried to allay the fears of parents through
information sessions about AIDS. Still, not everyone is convinced
that their children are risk-free.
   Jason became infected from a transfusion of tainted blood
products to treat his hemophilia, in which the blood fails to clot
properly.
   AIDS, both incurable and fatal, cripples the body's defenses
against disease, leaving the victims prey to infections and cancer.
   The Robertsons successfully fought in federal court to get Jason
in a regular classroom at Prather Elementary School in Granite
City. Before the judge's ruling last May, the boy had been schooled
alone in a one-room trailer on school ground.

<HEAD>Metro Growth: Three-Fourths of Americans are Urban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America is an increasingly metropolitan
nation, with more than three out of four people living in urban
areas, the Census Bureau reports.
   The nation's 282 metropolitan areas grew to 187.1 million
residents as of July 1, 1987, up 1 percent from the year before and
compared to just 0.3 percent growth in rural areas, the bureau
reported Thursday.
   Florida and Texas included nine of the nation's fastest-growing
metropolitan areas, and all 10 leaders were in the Sun Belt, the
study found.
   Only one change occurred among the 10 largest metro areas, with
Washington, D.C., edging up one spot to edge out Houston for the
No. 9 ranking.
   The Washington area added 78,300 people between 1986 and 1987
while economically plagued Houston lost 21,000, the bureau said.
The 1987 figures show Washingto with 3,646,000 people to Houston's
3,626,300.
   Naples, Fla., was listed as the fastest-growing metro area,
climbing 49 percent in this decade to 127,900, placing it at 215th
among metro areas. That's up from 265th place in 1980.
   Most of the fastest-growing areas had relatively smaller
population bases, however. That means it doesn't take as many new
arrivals to provide a large percentage increase.
   The fastest-growing metropolitan area of 1 million or more was
Phoenix, census officials noted. It grew by 30 percent in this
decade, edging out Dallas-Fort Worth, which was up 27 percent.
   While 76.9 percent of Americans live in the nation's 282
metropolitan areas, nearly half, 48.9 percent, reside in the 37
areas with more than a million residents each, the report showed.
   Metropolitan areas are designated by the federal Office of
Management and Budget and are used for many federal programs. In
general, they consist of a central city with at least 50,000
residents and the surrounding region which is economically linked
to that city. Many metropolitan areas include several major cities,
often crossing state lines.
   Washington, for example, includes portions of Virginia and
Maryland; the New York metro areas extends into New Jersey and
Connecticut and Chicago also counts sections of Indiana and
Wisconsin.
   New York remains firmly atop the list of metro areas, including
an estimated 18,053,800 people, up from 18,019,800 in 1986 and
17,539,532 in the 1980 census.
   Second is the Los Angeles region with 13,470,900, followed by
Chicago, 8,146,900; San Francisco, 5,953,100 and Philadelphia,
5,890,600.
   Rounding out the top 10 were Detroit, Boston, Dallas, Washington
and Houston.
   While the census study didn't include growth rates for all metro
areas, here is the list of the 10 fastest-growing metro areas
between 1980 and 1987:
   1. Naples, Fla., 127,900, up 49 percent.
   2. Ocala, Fla., 181,300, up 48 percent.
   3. Fort Myers, Fla., 294,600, up 44 percent.
   4. Fort Pierce, Fla., 215,400, up 43 percent.
   5. Austin, Texas, 738,000, up 38 percent.
   6. Melbourne, Fla., 374,900, up 37 percent.
   7. West Palm Beach, Fla., 790,100, up 37 percent.
   8. Las Cruces, N.M., 128,800, up 34 percent.
   9. McAllen, Texas, 378,600, up 34 percent.
   10.Orlando, Fla., 934,700, up 34 percent.

   The fire that killed five children in a house
whose back doors and windows were blocked by burglar bars was
deliberately set, fire officials said Thursday.
   ``It was not an accidental fire,'' said fire Capt. William D.
Young.
   The five children who died Wednesday ranged in age from 2 to 18.
They died even as firefighters sawed through padlocked burglar bars
on the back door and windows. A sixth child survived and remained
in critical condition Thursday.
   One of the victims was 16-year-old football player Bernard
Jordan who relatives and friends said received several threatening
phone calls.
   ``They said, `I know where you live and I know what room you're
in,''' said Mollie Jordan, 52, the children's grandmother and legal
guardian. ``They talked about burning the house down.''
   Officials found an empty gasoline can inside the house. Also,
officials said, a small sofa had been pushed against the front
door, hampering the victim's escape.
   Officials went to Wilmer questioned classmates of the
16-year-old victim on Thursday.
   Authorities went to Wilmer-Hutchins High School Thursday to
investigate the reports of threats to the 16-year-old boy.
   Bryant Pearl, who said he was a close friend of Bernard Jordan,
told the Dallas Times Herald that the boy had spoken as recently as
Tuesday night of fears that ``something bad is going to happen to
me.''
   The youth was found slumped over two younger children he
apparently was trying to protect from the fire, according to fire
reports.
   Mollie Jordan said she had left the burglar bars unlocked to
avoid a fire hazard and could not explain why the sofa blocked the
front door.

<HEAD>El Nino Studies Implicate Undersea Current, Earthquakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A massive undersea current and earthquakes on
the floor of the Pacific Ocean may be related to the El Nino, a
periodic climate change that can disrupt weather around the world,
according to a pair of new studies.
   Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration reported Thursday that the huge current flowing
beneath the surface of the Pacific may have signaled the end of the
1986-87 El Nino.
   The American Geophysical Union, meanwhile, published a report,
which it acknowledged was controversial, disclosing an apparent
relationship between El Nino and seafloor earthquakes.
   The term El Nino refers to a complex series of atmospheric and
ocean events that occur every two to seven years. It attracted
widespread attention in 1982-83 when the phenomena disrupted
weather patterns around the world. It was eventually blamed for
1,500 deaths and damage ranging from $2 billion to $8 billion.
   That, however, was the strongest El Nino of this century. Most
fit the much milder pattern seen in 1986-87, when some weather
changes were noted, but little major damage was done.
   The disruptions of 1982-83 included a worsening of Africa's
deadly drought, severe winter storms in California, reduced fish
catch in South America, Australia's worst drought in 200 years,
heavy rainfalls i Peru and Ecuador and the first typhoon to hit
French Polynesia in 75 years _ followed by five more in five months.
   Scientists measure the arrival and departure of an El Nino
(pronounced el-neen-yo) by changes in ocean surface temperatures
along the west coast of South America and changes in the air
pressure differential between northern Australia and the central or
eastern Pacific.
   Falling air pressure at Easter Island tends to be a good
indicator of an El Nino, according to an analysis by Daniel A.
Walker of the University of Hawaii.
   His findings, reported in the American Geophysical Union's
weekly periodical ``Eos,'' found a correlation between that air
pressure drop and increases in seafloor earthquakes in the Easter
Island region.
   The article was ``published with our recognition that it
presents controversial material. ... Even the possibility of
linkages here should be of interest to both geophysicists and
oceanographers,'' wrote Eos oceanography editor Robin D. Muench.
   Increased earthquake activity occurred at about the same time as
the El Ninos of 1965, 1976-77 and 1986-87 and just ahead of the El
Ninos of 1972-73 and 1982-83, Walker found.
   While he doesn't draw any conclusions about cause and effect,
Walker points out that the likelihood of these things occurring
together by chance is one out of 313 cases.
   And he notes that the seafloor fractures in the Easter Island
region which tend to generate the earthquakes vent large amounts of
heat into the ocean.
   If this heat were enough to warm the waters above, it could help
generate rising air currents, reducing the normal air pressure in
the region. Some scientists have been skeptical about this
possibility, however.
   Meanwhile, Michael McPhaden of NOAA's Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, reported on the interruption
of the Equatorial Undercurrent in the Pacific Ocean.
   Under normal conditions, westward-blowing winds push the water
at the ocean's surface to the west, and that flow is balanced by
water moving easterly in a current about 175 miles wide about 150
to 800 feet beneath the sea surface.
   When an El Nino occurs the trade winds weaken, however. The
surface water flow eases up and thus the balancing deep-sea current
does, too, McPhaden found.
   That occurred in 1986 and 1987, he reports. Indeed, for a time
the undersea flow of water even was reversed, according to data
collected from moored instruments.
   ``Perhaps the origins of El Nino's demise may be found in the
weak winds which typify it at its peak,'' McPhaden speculated.
   This current moves a volume of as much as 800 million gallons of
water a second, and climate experts have pointed out that the heat
from warm ocean water has major impacts on the world's climate.

<HEAD>Quayle, Bentsen Get Extensive Briefings On The Road</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early in his vice presidential campaign, Sen.
Dan Quayle was challenged by a reporter to show he understood
``target prices,'' a keystone of U.S. farm commodity programs.
   His halting, somewhat defensive answer went like this:
   ``Target prices? How that works? I know quite a bit about farm
policy. I come from Indiana, which is a farm state. Deficiency
payments, which are the key, that is what gets money into the
farmer's hands. We got loan rates, we got target prices.''
   Aides to Quayle quickly hustled the Republican vice presidential
nominee away before the matter could be pursued further.
   They concede privately that there are areas where he needs to
bone up, namely on agricultural and economic issues. But they point
out that on defense and national security, Quayle considers himself
an expert, not without reason.
   His Democratic counterpart, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, has
spent 18 years in the Senate and is considered quite knowledgeable
on a number of issues, particularly in his work on the Senate
Finance Committee he chairs.
   But both vice presidential nominees need _ and get _ extensive
briefings as they stump throughout the country, not only on
regional issues but also on positions enunciated by their
respective running mates.
   The briefings have intensified as the two candidates prepare for
their debate Wednesday in Omaha, Neb.
   Quayle devoted Thursday to debate preparation and looked ahead
to a weekend of tutelage from Roger Ailes, the Bush campaign's
media adviser. Bentsen snatched time to study during a light
campaign schedule before returning to Washington late Friday for
two days of meetings and briefings with top Democratic advisers.
   Quayle has been studying briefing papers on various issues
prepared for him under the supervision of Jim Ciccone, a former
aide to Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III. Ciccone is
Quayle's issues and research director.
   The day on the road begins with a meeting of Quayle's senior
staff and consultation with campaign headquarters in Washington.
The staff then briefs the senator on the day's schedule and current
news. Quayle himself reads some newspapers, but mostly relies on
oral staff briefings for information. Throughout the day, aides
keep in touch with the Washington office or with Quayle's Senate
office to research anything new that may come up.
   Papers or speeches are transmitted via fax machine at the hotel
where the campaign stays each night or are reviewed by the
respective presidential campaigns by telephone, a system Bentsen's
staff also uses.
   Bentsen receives extensive briefings by a group of people mostly
from the Dukakis campaign when he's in Washington, usually on
Monday before he heads out.
   Each morning on the road, he's briefed again. Victoria Radd, who
worked with Michael Dukakis' campaign chairman Paul Brountas on the
team that picked Bentsen for the ticket, outlines for the senator
Dukakis' positions on the issues.
   The campaign brings in specialists for whatever issue or
political situation is developing that day. For example, Bentsen's
Finance Committee expert on health programs was on board on a
recent trip in which Bentsen announced a rural health program.
Larry Harrington, the Dukakis-Bentsen southern coordinator, travels
with Bentsen when he's in the South.
   Both senators often pick up a Senate colleague when they're in a
particular area to fill them in on important local issues. Sen.
David Boren, D-Okla., rode the plane with Bentsen on the way to
Oklahoma City, for example, and Sen. Bob Kasten, R-Wis., traveled
with Quayle to Milwaukee area events.
   Neither Bentsen nor Quayle holds many news conferences these
days. But if there is to be a press availability, Quayle's staff
runs him through some possible questions.
   ``We just try and anticipate issues and questions, and make sure
he's got something to say,'' said David Prosperi, Quayle's
spokesman.
   When Quayle is unprepared his comments can come out garbled,
like his response on target prices at the Missouri State Fair,
which actually came close to the mark without being a lucid
explanation.
   Joe O'Neill, Bentsen's traveling chief of staff, says that there
is no comparable effort to ``program'' the Texas senator.
   ``We don't tell him there's a question (that's going to be
asked), and here's your answer. There's none of that,'' he says.
   In matters of defense and national security, Quayle can end up
briefing his staff, based on his Senate Armed Services Committee
experience.
   When a reporter asked how many warheads a Soviet SS-25 mobile
intercontinental ballistic missile was capable of carrying, Quayle
_ not his staff _ knew the answer. (It has been tested with up to
three.)
   But such knowledge is arcane, not necessarily riveting stuff to
the voters. More often than not, it is Quayle's apparent lack of
knowledge in a certain area that gets headlines.
   Quayle confounded reporters at a Billings, Mont., news
conference when he appeared not to know that not all states
restricted gun sales: ``Convicted felons can't just walk into a
store and buy a gun. There are all sorts of restrictions, there are
all sorts of state laws,'' he said.
   In a newspaper interview, Quayle said he did not know that Bush
was in charge of a major federal program to fight drugs, a program
Quayle himself would head if he becomes vice president.
   Quayle's aides say he is doing better, and they note that he has
had to get used to a national campaign vastly different from a home
state race ``both in the pace of events and the depth of the
inquiry,'' as a senior campaign official put it.
   ``Themes and issues are changing hourly here,'' said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Nobody knows more
than Sen. Quayle how rigorous the inspection of things large and
small can be.''

<HEAD>Prosecutors to Decide Whether to Try Rowan Case Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next move in the weapons case against
syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan is up to prosecutors after a
jury was unable to decide if he should be convicted for using an
unregistered handgun to shoot a teen-age intruder in his back yard.
   District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Arthur L. Burnett Sr.
declared a mistrial in the case Thursday after the 12-member panel
had spent more than seven fruitless hours over two days in search
of a verdict.
   Prosecutors now must decide whether to conduct another trial
before a new jury. Claude Bailey, a spokesman for the city's top
attorney, said no decision had been made yet on that question.
   One juror who declined to be identified said the panel's last
vote was 9-3 in favor of acquittal. A unanimous verdict was
required.
   Jury foreman William C. Bartee, 66, said he saw ``barrels of
reasonable doubt'' and that ``before I would have given over to the
(pro-conviction) side, I would have waded through Hell barefoot
from now until Christmas.''
   Rowan would not comment after the ruling, but his attorney,
Raoul Carroll, noted the possibility of another trial, saying
``We've still got a way to go.''
   Rowan, 63, was charged with using an unregistered handgun and
ammunition to shoot a teen-ager who had taken an unauthorized dip
in his swimming pool. Conviction on the weapons charges is
punishable by up to two years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
   The columnist shot 18-year-old Benjamin Smith in the wrist after
he found Smith and several other youths in his back yard in the
pre-dawn hours of June 14. Police had just arrived in front of the
house when Rowan shot the teen-ager.
   ``My mind is pretty clear as to whether or not he had an
unregistered weapon because he shot me with it, and there's not a
whole lot of confusion about that,'' Smith told WRC-TV from
Massachusetts where he goes to college.
   ``I'm not gonna go pool hopping again,'' he said when asked what
lessons he had learned from the incident. ``I can't understand what
would motivate him to go ahead and get his Saturday night special
loaded and slip out the back door and shoot me with the police
right around the corner. I just can't understand it.''
   The defense built its case around a little-used legal principle
called ``entrapment by estoppel.'' The principle holds that a
person cannot be convicted for following advice given by government
officials.
   Rowan testified that his son, Carl Jr., a former FBI agent, was
repeatedly rebuffed by police officials when he tried to register
the .22-caliber revolver used in the shooting.
   Rowan's son also testified that police told him others in his
family could have access to the gun as well.
   ``He (Carl Jr.) was depending upon the competence and
intelligence of those people that the District of Columbia put
there,'' Carroll argued during the trial. ``He was entirely at the
mercy of the District of Columbia.''
   Rowan, who is black, testified that he was given the weapon by
his son in 1982 after receiving a series of death threats from
people purporting to be members of the Ku Klux Klan.
   Perhaps mindful of the charges of hypocrisy leveled at him
because of the strong anti-gun stance in his own writings, the
columnist told the jury that he had not easily arrived at a
decision to arm himself.
   ``I had never had a gun in this house,'' Rowan said. ``We (Rowan
and his son) got into a little hassle about how sometimes you can
let your idealism go so far that you get killed.''
   Prosecutors contended, however, that Rowan simply was not
authorized to handle a weapon not registered to him.
   ``We are here simply because the handgun is not registered,''
prosecutor Thomas C. Collier told the court. ``The death threats,
the shooting and the issue of trespassing have nothing to do with
this case.''
   Rowan maintained that he shot Smith because he was afraid the
intruder was trying to enter the house. Smith said he was trying to
flee when Rowan shot him.

<HEAD>London Ticket Prices On The Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Look out, theater buffs, London ticket prices are
going up.
   That's the unfortunate truth in the British capital, a city that
has long been an attraction in part because of its relatively low
ticket costs.
   Last week's opening of ``Sugar Babies,'' the burlesque musical
that was a long-running hit on Broadway, set a new London top price
of 22 pounds ($37).
   Drama and comedy, which only two or three years ago had a price
ceiling of $17 or so, now routinely cost up to $25.
   Even the government-subsidized sector, whose prices have
traditionally trailed the commercial West End, is following suit.
Top tickets at the National Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Co.
in London are $23 and $25, respectively, and prices at the
company's home theater in Stratford-upon-Avon run as high as $46
for each of 20 ``superseats'' billed as the best in the house.
   ``It's market forces,'' William Wilkinson, the Royal Shakespeare
Co.'s financial controller, told The Associated Press.
   ``It's a combination of the availability of funding and what the
general market trends are,'' he said, explaining that the company
must compensate for dwindling government subsidies with increased
box office revenue.
   David Martin, the producer of ``Sugar Babies,'' said having
Mickey Rooney and Ann Miller as the show's two stars justified the
ticket price.
   ``We have two of the highest-paid theatrical performers in the
world, and the only way to bring them to the West End ... was to
charge those prices,'' Martin said of Rooney and Miller, who won
local raves for their performances.
   He said the leads had the highest combined salaries ever seen on
the West End. Martin said their pay represented about one-third of
the weekly running cost which he put in the range of about $140,000.
   As is the case on Broadway, one ticket increase tends to trigger
increases across the board, and Martin said he expected other
musicals soon to begin charging 22.50 pounds ($38).
   While these prices are well below the $55 Broadway high set by
the upcoming musical built around Jerome Robbins' choreography,
they still represent a hefty bite of the paycheck in a city where
salaries are generally lower than in New York.
   But London continues to offer a greater variety of discounts
than Broadway. In addition to a half-price ticket booth like the
one in New York, Londoners can take advantage of student and senior
citizen discounts, stand-by seats and day seats _ specifically set
aside to be sold on the day of performance.
   Price ranges are also wider. The Royal Shakespeare Co. in
Stratford, for example, offers balcony seats for as little as $7.50
_ a move that financial controller Wilkinson said balanced out the
``superseat'' prices.
   He said the higher ticket costs did not bother him ``as long as
we have a sufficient number of seats at the lower end of the
spectrum for people who can't afford the (top tickets).''

   The glow of four superpower summits may be
bright enough to last through the less than four months remaining
in the Reagan administration. But discord over Afghanistan could
snuff it out.
   The Soviets are hinting if Pakistan allows the training and
arming of guerrillas from its territory to continue, the Red Army's
withdrawal could come to a screeching halt.
   State Department officials are inclined to believe the dispute
will not come to that, but Gennady Gerasimov, the Soviet foreign
ministry spokesman, warned at a news conference here on Thursday
that if the ``flagrant violations'' continue the consequences could
be unpredictable.
   ``We don't want to be specific,'' he said. But everybody assumed
he meant a suspension of the troop withdrawal or possibly a
widening of the war.
   Before flying to Moscow for a Communist party plenum, Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze asked U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar for a detailed
investigation of the Soviet complaint.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, meanwhile, registered his
own complaint that the Soviets and the Afghan government were
violating the Geneva accords of last April by bombing Pakistani
territory.
   He suggested Wednesday evening in a meeting with Perez de
Cuellar, Shevardnadze and the foreign ministers of Britain, China
and France that the UN observers were the appropriate mechanism to
conduct an investigation.
   Gerasimov accused the UN observers of an inadequate job on the
very day the 9,991 UN peacekeepers operating in seven regional hot
spots around the world had been awarded the Nobel peace prize in
celebration of their global mission.
   A further irony is that the Soviets do not contribute
financially to the peacekeeping operation.
   Apart from the impact on U.S.-Soviet relations, Gerasimov hinted
that the Soviets might undercut the entire peacekeeping operation,
which as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council they have
the power to do.
   ``If we do not succeed in creating an efficient control
mechanism here in Afghanistan, which is kind of a testing ground,
then we will have difficulties in creating this kind of mechanism
in other conflicts,'' he said.
   The grim look on the faces of Shultz and Shevardnadze and U.S.
Ambassador Vernon Walters as they left the Secretariat building
after the meeting Wednesday evening was a tipoff how serious the
dispute has become.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze have worked hard and successfully to
repair U.S.-Soviet relations over the last three years.
   They ironed out the differences that had blocked completion of a
treaty to abolish U.S. and Soviet ground-launched
intermediate-range nuclear missiles. And they succeeded in
resolving regional tensions.
   The Geneva accords, providing for the withdrawal of the more
than 100,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan, were the product of a
U.S.-Soviet reconciliation.
   But now, completion of that withdrawal may be in doubt.
   Gerasimov said Pakistan armed the Afghan guerrillas and was
allowing at least two training camps to operate on its territory
for about 3,400 fighters.
   He said 2,500 Afghan fighters were in training near Islamabad,
the Pakistani capital, and 900 others at a base near the Afghan
border with the assistance of Chinese, American and Pakistani
advisers.
   Gerasimov also accused Pakistani authorities of patrolling
refugee camps to stop Afghans from returning to their homeland.
   With both the Soviets and the Americans looking to the United
Nations for a solution, the dispute is shaping up as an acid test
of the Nobel prize winners.

<HEAD>Campaign Over Stennis' Seat Becomes `Awkward' At Times</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK ELLIOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battle over who will succeed
87-year-old John C. Stennis to the U.S. Senate has been punctuated
with cries of ``Let George Go!'' _ a reference to the man paid
$50,000 a year to chauffer and protect House minority whip Trent
Lott in Washington.
   Democrat Wayne Dowdy launched his campaign against Lott by
focusing on the employee, George Awkward, whose salary is almost
five times the average farm income and more than three times the
average family income in this dirt-poor state.
   In his bid to retain a Senate seat for the Democrats, Dowdy has
urged Lott to ``let George go'' and said that ``before we cut
services to our senior citizens in Mississippi, let's cut George.''
   To combat the Dowdy campaign, Lott has reminded his Democratic
opponent and House colleague that funds for the bodyguards _
accorded most of the congressional leadership _ were in a bill
Dowdy voted for and Lott opposed.
   Further, Awkward was featured in a Lott television commercial
pointedly telling the Democrat: ``Mr. Dowdy, I'm nobody's
chauffeur. Got it?''
   But beyond a squabble over perks in the nation's capital is a
deeper struggle between two young, veteran politicians of markedly
different philosophies. Whoever is elected, an era in Mississippi
politics will end.
   There has been only one new U.S. senator elected in Mississippi
since 1947, when Stennis won election. The late Sen. James O.
Eastland, also a Democrat, preceded Stennis in the Senate by five
years.
   When Eastland retired in 1978, Republican Thad Cochran was
elected as the state's first GOP senator since Reconstruction.
Lott, from the conservative 5th Congressional District in Southern
Mississippi, is hoping Stennis' retirement a decade later due to
declining health will give him the same chance to advance.
   Lott was elected in 1972 to succeed his one-time employer on
Capitol Hill, the late Rep. William Colmer, when the Democrat
retired. The 46-year-old lawyer was elected minority whip in 1980.
   As a member of the House Judiciary Committee in his first term,
Lott staunchly defended Richard Nixon during his impeachment
hearings. The exposure pushed Lott to the leadership of the
conservative wing of the Republican Party.
   Lott voted for the 1986 tax reform act, and has repeatedly voted
for aid to the Contra and Angola rebels. He also has voted to put
limits on the Clean Water Act, against efforts to limit Star Wars
funding and against sanctions against the white-minority government
of South Africa.
   Despite his strict conservative voting record, he has preferred
to stress while campaigning his backing of employment and economic
development programs in general terms.
   Dowdy has sharply criticized Lott for voting to cut funding for
social programs, including votes on Social Securty, Medicaid,
welfare issues _ all of which provide support for a large number of
poor Mississippians, both black and white.
   The Republican has countered that when the chips were down _
that is, in final consideration of legislation _ he successfully
fought efforts to bail out the budget by using Social Security
funds. The record appears to bear that out.
   Dowdy was a folksy, small-town mayor in McComb when he was voted
into Congress in a closely fought special election. He was the
first Democrat elected to that post since 1972.
   The 45-year-old Dowdy's congressional district is dominated by
the capital city of Jackson, a Republican stronghold for decades.
But the rural sections of the southwestern part of the state, with
their large black voting population, propelled Dowdy to
re-elections in 1982, 1984 and 1986.
   Lott has tried to pin on Dowdy the label of a ``tax and spend''
liberal. He has cited Dowdy for what he has called a liberal voting
record and for his votes against Reagan administration efforts to
reduce federal spending.
   At the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Miss., Lott asked a
crowd whether they wanted a senator ``that is going to follow in
the line of McGovern, Mondale, O'Neill, Wright, Jackson and
Dukakis.''
   Dowdy's voting record generally has followed party lines. He
voted against the Reagan tax cut and against on limits on the Clean
Water Act. He also voted for sanctions against the South African
government and for aid to the Contra rebels and for limits on the
``Star Wars'' program. He was against aid to the Angola rebels.

<HEAD>Stand-Up Comedy Routines Fell Flat for Sally Field and Tom Hanks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oscar-winning actress Sally Field and
``Punchline'' co-star Tom Hanks took the stage at comedy nightclubs
to prep for their movie roles, but they agreed it really didn't
work out.
   ``The first few times I was terrible,'' said Hanks. ``I thought
I would have four or five minutes of material and I didn't. I had
about a minute. The rest was all stammering.''
   Miss Field turned to comedian-friend Lily Tomlin for advice and
was told to get up on stage. At a club in Manhattan Beach, her
recent 45-minute routine turned into a question-and-answer session.
   In ``Punchline,'' the actress plays New Jersey housewife Lilah
Krytsick, who pursues a dream of being a comic and draws laughs by
recounting her shock at the modern ways of love.
   ``No matter how you poke, punch or prod, it's boring,'' Miss
Field said of Lilah's appearance and lifestyle. ``But I had a
feeling her comedy was sexually oriented.''
   Hanks, riding on the success of his box-office hit ``Big,'' said
preparing to play the manic Steven Gold gave him an appreciation
for the comic's life. After coal miners and police officers,
comedians have the toughest job, he said.
   ``You have to travel across the country, doing two or three acts
a night, talking to a room full of drunken strangers,'' he said.

   The Soviets charged that U.N. peacekeeping
forces in Afghanistan were failing in their mission hours after the
peacekeepers popped champagne corks to celebrate their Nobel Peace
Prize.
   Several Western leaders, including President Reagan who was
himself in the running for the prize, praised the decision to award
it to U.N. peacekeepers worldwide.
   U.N. leaders said they, too, were delighted with the award
announced Thursday, but they also pleaded for the release of a U.S.
Marine kidnapped while serving with a peacekeeping group in Lebanon.
   Spokesman Gennady Gerasimov of the Soviet Foreign Ministry said
Thursday that U.N. peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan are ``not
doing their job properly.'' He said they should be investigated by
the head of the United Nations before any future peacekeeping
forces are approved.
   ``If we do not succeed in creating an efficient control
mechanism here in Afghanistan, which is kind of a testing ground,
then we will have difficulties in creating this kind of mechanism
in other conflicts,'' said Gerasimov.
   Up to 500,000 people have worn the blue helmet or beret of the
U.N. peacekeeping forces, and 9,991 soldiers now are in the force
supported by about 2,000 civilian personnel. A total of 733 have
died on missions.
   The foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council met Wednesday at the request of Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to discuss Soviet claims that the
United States and Pakistan are violating the Afghan accords signed
in Geneva on April 14.
   Those accords call for the Soviets to withdraw more than 100,000
troops from Afghanistan and for Afghanistan and Pakistan to respect
each other's territorial integrity.
   Humayun Khan, Pakistani secretary of state for foreign affairs,
said Thursday in Islamabad that it was the Kabul government, not
his own, that had violated the accords. He said he expected the
Soviet Union to withdraw from Afghanistan as scheduled.
   The Soviet Union has been bolstering a Marxist government in
Afghanistan, and Pakistan and the United States have backed
anti-government rebels.
   Gerasimov also said that at the meeting of the Security Council
foreign ministers, ``We drew the attention of the ministers and of
the (U.N.) Secretary-General (Perez de Cuellar) to the flagrant
violations by Pakistan of the Geneva Accords and said that the
consequences of these actions may be unpredictable.''
   In New Delhi, India on Thursday, Soviet Ambassador-at-large
Nicolai Kozyrev said Pakistani violations include supplying rebels
with long-range missiles for bombarding Kabul and preventing Afghan
refugees from returning home.
   On Tuesday, Shevardnaze said the Soviets had finished the first
part of their troop withdrawal but had not yet begun the second
phase. He said they would wait to see if the alleged violations
were halted.
   U.N. observers have confirmed that half the Soviet troops
withdrew by Aug. 15, so Shevardnadze's statement meant the Red Army
retreat has been halted for the last six weeks. The withdrawal
began May 15 and is to be complete by Feb. 15, 1989.
   Meanwhile, Thursday's Nobel decision was praised by French
President Francois Mitterrand, British Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe, and Reagan. Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
Reagan were in the running for the December 1987 agreement to
eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons.
   U.N. leaders lauded their peacekeeping forces after the prize
was announced Thursday, but pleaded for the release of Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins.
   Higgins commanded a 76-man group attached to the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon when he was abducted Feb. 17.
   ``For us, it is a No. 1 priority that this officer who was
serving the United Nations, who was wearing the blue beret when he
was kidnapped, should be released without delay,'' said Marrack
Goulding, who leads the peacekeepers as U.N. undersecretary for
political affairs.
   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed
responsibility and said Higgins would be put on trial for spying.
U.S. and U.N. sources deny Higgins was a spy.
   Goulding's call for Higgins' release was the only somber note
sounded by U.N. staff.
   ``Everybody from the 38th floor to the basement is delighted,''
said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani. The secretary-general's
office is on the 38th floor.
   Goulding had no comment on how the $390,000 prize will be used.
U.N. officials will accept the prize Dec. 10 in Oslo, Norway.

   Swedish army Maj. Wilbert Algotson was
39 when he packed his wife and two small children into the family
car and drove off to the battlefield, to a war not his own.
   The Algotsons headed for Central Asia, where he helped supervise
the India-Pakistan cease-fire as a U.N. observer.
   Fifteen years later, the 36-man U.N. Observer Group in India and
Pakistan is still on duty along the disputed Jammu-Kashmir
frontier, and Algotson, along with thousands like him, has a small
share of the Nobel Peace Prize for 1988.
   The prize was awarded Thursday to the United Nations
peacekeeping forces.
   Algotson will never see any of the $390,000 in prize money, but,
in a telephone interview, he sounded satisfied all the same.
   ``I'm very pleased and also proud of having been part of it,''
he said.
   An army veteran, Algotson, like all other U.N. peacekeepers,
volunteered for the job. In neutral countries like Sweden and
Finland, which regularly contribute men and money to peacekeeping
efforts, such duty is usually the only chance to see action.
   ``I knew it could be dangerous, too. There were still exchanges
of fire over the line of control, in spite of the peace accord
after the Bangladesh war,'' he said.
   At that time, in 1973, making the drive was a popular thing to
do for the Finns, Danes, Swedes and other Europeans on the force,
he said. It was partly for the adventure, partly because of the
money involved.
   Algotson was entitled to an airline ticket for himself, but not
his family, so driving was the most economical way to get there.
The policy has become more generous in recent years.
   The plan, he said, was to do his job along the cease-fire line
while his family lived in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.
   Getting there was trouble enough. The drive took them through
Europe, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In Afghanistan, a
French family traveling ahead of them was murdered during an
overnight stop.
   During his one-year tour, Algotson served in several field
stations along the dividing line between hostile Indian and
Pakistani troops.
   ``We were out for three to four weeks with the Indian or
Pakistani units and then had a week or so off,'' he said.
   After a year, he and his family drove back to Sweden. Algotson
said he felt that people at home were interested and felt
positively about the United Nations and its work.
   He said there were a few extra allowances, but on the whole
financial rewards were few.
   ``My economy took a slight turn for the better. But at that time
the state didn't pay for the family, or for home leaves, so all in
all it probably was about the same,'' he said.
   ``The (1988 Nobel Peace Prize) choice was well motivated, since
everyone enlists to serve peace,'' Algotson said.
   ``It would be very troubling if the U.N. role became so weak
that this working process was no longer possible.''
   Algotson said it was gratifying to know that he helped prevent
the spread of a regional war. But of the conflict itself? ``I see
no end to it,'' he said.
   At 54, and still on army duty, Algotson said he was considering
volunteering again.
   ``If something comes up in Namibia I might go for it,'' he said.
   U.N. officials are considering sending a peacekeeping force to
Namibia, or South-west Africa, pending successful negotiations
between South Africa and Angola.

<HEAD>Mitterrand Says Anti-Chemical Arms Meet Possible This Year</HEAD>

   French President Francois Mitterrand says a
Paris conference proposed by President Reagan to tighten a ban on
chemical weapons could be held in three months.
   Mitterrand said the idea of a special conference to improve
enforcement of the 110-nation ban was one of a range of issues he
discussed with Reagan in meetings at the White House on Thursday.
   Mitterrand also spoke separately with Vice President George Bush
and his Democratic rival in the presidential campaign, Michael
Dukakis. He called both discussions excellent.
   Hubert Vedrine, spokesman for Mitterrand, told French reporters
that the discussion between Reagan and the French president
included a discussion of developments in the Soviet Union.
   ``Reagan said it was hard for Gorbachev to carry out his
policies, but he has the means to continue,'' said Vedrine.
   But at his news conference, Mitterrand declined to give his
views on the hastily called meeting of the Central Committee of the
Soviet Communist Party and other developments in the Soviet Union.
   In a speech Thursday morning to the United Nations, Mitterrand
pushed for movement on disarmament and a worldwide ban on the
production of chemical weapons. He met for 45 minutes with Reagan
in the afternoon and returned in the evening for a private dinner.
   He noted that there have been discussions for several days on
holding a conference to improve enforcement of the ban on chemical
weapons in view of allegations that Iraq has been violating the
accord.
   ``It's true that it was President Reagan who asked me about the
possibility of having the conference in Paris and my answer was, of
course, in the affirmative,'' Mitterrand said.
   Asked whether such a conference could be held soon, he said,
``If by soon you mean, say, within three months' time, the answer
would be yes, I think. It would at any rate be a possibility. I'm
not saying it would be a probability.''
   He said he imagined Reagan would be happy to take part in the
conference, but that his participation would not be a consideration
in fixing a date for the session.
   In his U.N. speech Mitterrand called for creating ``a situation
which would make it impossible for any state to use chemical
weapons with impunity to settle its external or internal problems''
and suggested increasing the role of the United Nations in
enforcing the ban.
   France would be ready to join in ``an embargo on all deliveries
of products, technologies and more generally weapons'' to any
offending country, he said.
   And he said the world should also ``prohibit not only the use
but also the manufacture of chemical weapons.''
   Mitterrand said Reagan asked him what he thought were the most
urgent problems to be attacked and that he responded, first, Third
World debt and second, Lebanon's civil unrest, but he did not go
into detail at the news conference.
   The day began for Mitterrand began with his 40-minute meeting
with Dukakis in New York. Spokesman Vedrine said the Democratic
candidate spent most of his time asking questions.
   The staffs of Mitterrand and Bush had been unable to find a time
when both could meet, so they had a discussion by telephone,
Vedrine said.
   The French president, asked for his impressions of Dukakis, said
``they are excellent. And I had a phone call this evening from Mr.
Bush, and if you asked me the same question, I would say, `Very
good.' ''
   Asked whether he had a preference, he said, ``I will wait and
see the preference of the Americans.''

   The sexiest stars in America are Patrick Swayze
and Cher, according to US magazine's annual readers poll of the 10
sexiest men and women.
   Swayze's ``Dirty Dancing'' co-star, Jennifer Grey, was ninth,
the magazine said in its Oct. 17 issue.
   Tom Selleck, last year's No. 1, slipped to sixth after hanging
up his ``Magnum, P.I.'' Hawaiian shirt, US said. ``Miami Vice''
star Don Johnson also slipped: down to No. 8 after capturing No. 4
last year and first two years ago.
   Actress Demi Moore made the list at No. 10 while her new
husband, actor Bruce Willis, ``took a flyer for the first time in
three years,'' said US.
   Meg Ryan came in eighth; her boyfriend, Dennis Quaid, was 10th.
   Cher, the 42-year-old Oscar-winning actress, is known both for
her devotion to motherhood and her romance with 24-year-old Rob
Camilletti. Swayze, 36, a former ballet dancer, lives with his wife
of 12 years, Lisa Niemi, on a ranch near Los Angeles.
   The other winners: No. 2, Jane Seymour, 37, and Tom Cruise, 26;
No. 3, Kevin Costner, 33, and Jaclyn Smith, 41; No. 4, Kathleen

   Joe Garagiola's immigrant parents never
appreciated what he did for a living, says the baseball
player-turned-sportscaster.
   ``My mother only went to one game in her life. It was at night,
and she looked up at all the lights, and she asked my brother,
`Who's going to pay the electricity?''' Garagiola said in an
interview to be published in Sunday's Parade magazine.
   Garagiola recalled the 1946 World Series, in which he played as
a rookie catcher for the St. Louis Cardinals: ``It was a dream
every kid has, to be in the series. It was the first time I'd ever
seen Ted Williams (of the Boston Red Sox) live. I didn't know
whether to call for the pitch or ask for his autograph.''
   But the 1964 World Series, when he was a broadcaster was the
most poignant, he said.
   ``Yogi (Berra) is down there on the field managing, and I'm
broadcasting, and we're the two kids who used to sit under the
lamppost in front of (our friend) Pucci's house, talking about
being in the Series,'' he said.
   ``There's one vacuum, though _ that our parents _ Yogi's and
mine _ never really understood what we achieved.''

   Dawn Wells has performed in many roles, but she
says she doesn't duck fans who remember her as Mary Ann from the TV
show ``Gilligan's Island.''
   ``I was at Ludwig's castle in Germany and this couple came
running out of the woods in the rain, shouting, `Mary Ann! Mary
Ann!' in German,'' Wells said in the Oct. 17 issue of US magazine.
``The fans are still out there. It's wonderful.''
   Wells, who had a variety of roles in theater after the series
ended, currently is starring in ``Fire Escape'' at the Richmond
Shepard Theater in Los Angeles. She played Mary Ann from 1964 to
1967; the show has been in reruns since then.
   ``It's fun to be a part of television history,'' said Wells,
whom the magazine described as ``fortyish.'' ``We were made fun of
for so long, and now we're an institution.''

   Arkady N. Shevchenko, the
highest-ranking Soviet official to defect to the United States, was
listed in fair condition after he collapsed during a speech.
   Shevchenko, an undersecretary general at the United Nations for
the Soviet Union from 1973 to 1978, was taken to St. Vincent's
Medical Center for treatment of intestinal bleeding after he became
ill during a talk Wednesday night at Florida Community College.
   Doctors worked on Shevchenko, 57, for three hours before he was
moved to the intensive care unit in fair condition, said hospital

   Honduras denied a report in a
Nicaraguan pro-government newspaper that Honduran aircraft drew
fire while penetrating Nicaraguan airspace.
   ``The reports are totally false,'' armed forces spokesman Juan
Sierra Fonseca said on Thursday. He called the reports ``alarming
because they generate tensions in Central America.''
   Barricada, the newspaper of Nicaragua's governing Sandinista
party, said on Wednesday that Nicaraguan troops fired artillery and
rockets at Honduran military aircraft in Nicaraguan airspace near
the border. It said the Honduran planes were not hit.
   A Nicaraguan Defense Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Honduras, which is a key U.S. ally in Central
America, ``provoked'' Nicaraguan troops into shooting at the
aircraft.
   Barricada also said the Defense Ministry reported two shooting
incidents Tuesday between Nicaraguan and Honduran troops. It said
Honduran troops ``harassed'' two Nicaraguan border observation
posts with 50- and 60-caliber machine-gun fire.
   Eugenio Castro, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, denied the
Barricada reports and called them ``absurd.''
   Barricada said a helicopter gunship and an F-5 fighter jet from
the Honduran air force and a twin-engine plane without
identification recently flew over the border towns of Santo Tomas
del Nance, San Pedro de Potrero Grande and Somotillo. It did not
say when the incident took place.
   The report quoted Maj. Leonel Martinez, military commander for
Chinandega and Leon provinces in Nicaragua, as saying Sandinista
soldiers fired artillery shells and rockets at the intruders but
failed to hit them.
   Barricada said the incident heightened the possibility of a
military confrontation between Honduras and leftist Nicaragua.
   Honduras has permitted U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels known as
Contras to use its territory to launch attacks against Sandinista
forces.
   The bulk of Contra forces holed up in camps inside Honduras
after U.S. military aid for the rebels ended in February and a
truce in the 7-year-old civil war began in March.
   Martinez said the navy sank six Honduran boats trying to enter
Nicaraguan waters in the Gulf of Fonseca on Aug. 20, but that a
Sandinista army officer, Lt. Pablo Blanco Torres, died in the
incident. The gulf is shared by Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.
   Barricada quoted another regional military commander, Col.
Carlos Brenes, as saying Contras have tried to cross into Nicaragua
near the town of Palo Grande in Chinandega province.
   Brenes was quoted as saying Honduran troops have been harassing
the border post at Palo Grande to provide cover for Contras
sneaking into Nicaragua from Honduras. He also was quoted as saying
that the Hondurans have increased their troop strength in the area.
   He said the Sandinista army has not responded with ``any unusal
military mobilization,'' according to Barricada.

<HEAD>Report Blames Gas Compressor Explosion For Oil Rig Disaster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An explosion in the gas compressor of a North Sea
oil rig apparently sparked an inferno that killed 167 people in the
world's worst oilfield disaster, a government report said.
   The explosion probably ruptured pipelines carrying hydrocarbon
gases, setting off a series of blasts and fires that incinerated
the Piper Alpha rig owned by Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum
Corp., said the report released by the Department of Energy on
Thursday.
   The first explosions aboard Piper Alpha just before 10 p.m. July
6 seem to have severed electrical power and disabled control and
communications facilities, the report said.
   Three-quarters of the platform sank to the ocean floor 120 miles
off Scotland's eastern coast, trapping many of the victims. Two
would-be rescuers were among the dead.
   The Department of Energy's director of safety, Jim Petrie, who
is heading the technical inquiry into the disaster, announced that
safety regulations for oil rig operators would be tightened.
   Among areas that needed closer attention were oil companies'
technical procedures for dealing with oilfield emergencies, and
their firefighting and evacuation systems, he said.
   The government recommended last month that additional safety
valves be installed on offshore oil and gas rigs to disconnect the
flow of fuel to work areas in the event of an explosion.
   Currently, there are no regulations concerning the locations of
valves, although all rigs have some types of valves.
   Most of the 120 men still missing are believed to have been
trapped in the sunken living quarters. Occidental Petroleum said it
hopes to lift the accommodation modules to the surface early next
month.
   A public inquiry will open Nov. 11 in Aberdeen, Scotland, and
the technical inquiry will continue separately ``as long as it's
necessary to get to the facts,'' said a Department of Energy
spokesman.
   ``This is not the final report and much remains to be done,''
said Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson. ``A number of studies have
been commissioned and the results are yet to be received.
   The opposition Labor Party's spokesman on energy, John Prescott,
said safety legislation, rather than voluntary agreements with oil
companies, was needed urgently.
   ``The offshore oil industry is the most dangerous industry in
Britain,'' he charged. ``Its safety standards are being compromised
to maximize production and profit.''

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
said death squads could return to his war-torn country after a
rightist leader warned of renewed guerrilla war if the right fails
to win presidential elections.
   Duarte was responding to comments made Tuesday by legislator
Sigifrido Ochoa Perez of the right-wing party Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena.
   Ochoa, a retired army colonel, predicted rightist guerrilla
groups might form to fight Duarte's Christian Democrats if Arena
``is deprived of its rightful victory'' in presidential elections
next March.
   ``Someone asked me if it was true that if we did not win the
election we would resort to nationalist guerrilla warfare. And I
say, a frustrated people could do just that,'' Ochoa said.
   Duarte said the comment demonstrates Ochoa's ``violent mentality
and how little he believes in democracy.''
   ``They (Arena) still believe in imposing themselves by force,''
Duarte said. ``By speaking of rightist guerrilla struggle what he
really is saying is that they have to reactivate the death squads,
and that is grave.''
   Duarte spoke with journalists Thursday at Ilopango airport
outside the capital following a skydiving exhibition to mark
Paratrooper Day.
   Local and international human rights groups blame right-wing
death squads for the abduction and summary execution of thousands
of suspected leftists in the early 1980s. The human rights groups
and the government say Roberto D'Aubuisson, Arena's founder,
masterminded the death squad campaign.
   D'Aubuisson, currently a legislator, denies the accusations.
   Arena trounced the Christian Democrats in legislative and
municipal elections last March, taking control of the unicameral
legislature. The rightists are favored by most to win the
presidential race.
   Duarte, 62, is prohibited by the constitution from seeking
another term and has been diagnosed as having liver cancer.
   The defense minister, Gen. Carlos Vides Casanova, also at
Ilopango, said he saw little possibility of rightist guerrilla
warfare but added: ``Whether guerrilla struggle comes from the left
or the right, the government must be prepared to combat violence.''
   A 9-year-old civil war pitting leftist guerrillas against the
U.S.-backed government has killed an estimated 65,000 people, most
of them civilians.

<HEAD>Judge: $1.1 Million Settlement In AIDS Case Should Teach Schools
Lesson</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A $1.1 million award against school officials
for barring three young AIDS-infected brothers from class is a
lesson to educators nationwide, says the judge who approved the
settlement of the civil rights suit.
   ``Let us hope there will not have to be too many more cases for
other families and other school boards like the Ray case, which ...
was a landmark case,'' U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich
said Thursday after lawyers for both sides outlined the terms in
court.
   She praised both sides for settling the dispute without a trial,
which had been set to begin Monday in Fort Myers.
   The agreement between Louise and Clifford Ray and the DeSoto
County School District in Arcadia gives the couple's three sons
$820 a month each for the next 10 years, for a total of nearly
$100,000 each. Should one of them die before the end of the period,
the others or their parents would receive the remainder of the
award.
   The parents, whose home was burned down by an arsonist during
the uproar, each are to receive about $300 monthly for 30 years,
including a 3 percent annual increase for inflation, for a total of
more than $170,000 each. The parents also get an immediate $50,000
cash payment.
   The settlement, to be paid by the school district's insurance
company, contains $387,500 for attorney fees and $50,000 for court
costs.
   School officials had insisted too much was unknown about
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and they wouldn't risk
exposing other children to the deadly disease by admitting the
boys: Ricky, now 11, Robert, 10, and Randy, 9.
   Mrs. Ray said she hopes school officials ``have learned as much
from this situation as we have. You shouldn't be afraid of someone
who has AIDS because you can't catch it. And if you have a disease,
you shouldn't have to be ashamed of it.''
   The brothers have hemophilia, a genetic disease that keeps blood
from clotting. They probably were exposed to the AIDS virus through
plasma-based medication to clot their blood.
   Ricky Ray has developed AIDS-related complex, which can be a
precursor to the deadly disease, and is being treated with the
anti-AIDS drug AZT. His brothers have not exhibited any AIDS
symptoms.
   Patrick E. Geraghty, an attorney for National Union Fire
Insurance Co., said he would have preferred to go to trial, but
agreed to settle ``in an effort to have the matter resolved and put
behind everyone.''
   Ms. Kovachevich dismissed the case, marking the end to the Rays'
complaint that school officials violated their sons' rights in 1986
and 1987 by refusing them admission to elementary school. The
family later fled the town after the fire.
   The dispute turned bitter and threw the county into turmoil. The
parents sued. Angry parents in the rural community formed a
citizens group to bar AIDS infected students from school but held
meetings to combat an image of a town without pity.
   In August 1987, the boys went to class under a federal court
order. Parents staged a weeklong boycott that cut attendance in
half.
   At the end of that week, the Rays' house was burned by an
unknown arsonist. The family left the central Florida town for
Sarasota, about 50 miles away, where they now live and the boys
attend school without incident.
   Thursday's settlement did not require school officials to admit
negligence, said James Westberry, school board chairman.
   The lawsuit, which sought unspecified damages, accused school
officials of abusing their power, depriving the boys of their
rights because they were disabled and helping create an atmosphere
of hatred against the boys.
   AIDS can be transmitted through sexual contact, shared
hypodermic needles, and from pregnant women to their fetuses. It is
not spread through casual contact.

   Millions worldwide watched the United States return to space
with the blastoff of the shuttle, but state-run Soviet television
showed only a music and aerobics program as Discovery hummed
skyward.
   Thursday's dramatic liftoff interrupted afternoon children's
shows in Britain, broke into ``Hill Street Blues'' in France, and
propelled Japanese to their television sets after midnight.
   It also sent up cheers from people in many allied nations.
   ``With this, America has reclaimed manned space flight. NASA has
shown that it can again launch with safety and regain its lost
confidence,'' said Franz Buob, a commentator for West Germany's ZDF
television network.
   Many countries had announced plans for live coverage several
days in advance and billed it as a major television event. Despite
a 98-minute delay in the launch, most networks kept their promise
to broadcast it live.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. as well as its main rival,
Independent Television, did so. People also saw the liftoff live in
Holland, Italy, and Switzerland.
   Soviets, however, did not see the liftoff. The official news
agency Tass moved a brief dispatch on the blastoff within four
minutes. In a newscast several minutes later, an announcer reported
the blastoff against a backdrop of pictures taken of Discovery on
its Florida launch pad on Wednesday.
   Tass' two-sentence report said the shuttle, with five astronauts
aboard, blasted off sucessfully. The dispatch noted that it was the
first shuttle launch since the space shuttle Challenger exploded
Jan. 28, 1986.
   The news agency also chose Thursday to release the first
pictures of the new Soviet space shuttle, a winged craft that looks
just like its U.S. counterpart. The timing appeared calculated to
steal some of the thunder from Discovery's launch.
   A Tass story accompanying the pictures said the Soviet shuttle,
at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia, would be
launched on an unmanned mission to test its design and systems. The
report gave no date, but Soviet officials have said the liftoff
will take place sometime later this year.
   The Challenger disaster that killed its seven crewmembers was
also seen live in many countries. Thursday, many viewers abroad
said they were hoping for the success of the new mission.
   ``Thank God! Now let's keep our fingers crossed,'' said Elfriede
Haunold, a secretary in Vienna, Austria, after watching the shuttle
disappear into the sky.
   Workers at the headquarters of the European Space Agency in
Noordwijk, Netherlands, broke into applause as Discovery's main
rockets detached from the shuttle, ending the most dangerous phase
of the launch.
   ``It's quite a relief for everybody,'' said Dutch former
astronaut Wubbo Ockels, who flew on a Challenger mission in
November 1985.
   State-run Spanish television commentator Nuria Ribo told viewers
from the Cape Canaveral launch site: ``The successful launch of the
shuttle means a lot to Americans, and the important thing now is
that it's up and flying.''

   Seeing the launch of the space shuttle Discovery brought tears
and relief to some relatives of astronauts killed in the Challenger
disaster, but one father avoided watching the liftoff because ``I'd
just see the other one exploding.''
   ``It was wonderful, fabulous,'' said Jane Smith, widow of
Challenger pilot Michael Smith. ``I'm so proud of how everyone did
their job to make a successful effort.''
   Seeing Discovery soar past the tragic Challenger milestone ``was
very much a relief,'' she said.
   But while watching Thursday's launch, ``I was unaware of the
tears that came to me at remembering some of the things that I
tried very hard not to remember,'' she told ABC-TV in an interview
at the Johnson Space Center.
   Challenger exploded 73 seconds after lifting off Jan. 28, 1986,
from Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. From
that same pad Thursday morning, Discovery rocketed into space to
begin a four-day, 55-minute mission.
   Bruce Jarvis, father of Challenger payload specialist Gregory
Jarvis, said he listened to the Discovery launch on the radio from
his office in Orlando, Fla., declining an invitation to watch at
Cape Canaveral because ``it would bring too many memories back.
   ``I thought about watching it, but I couldn't take it,'' Jarvis
said. ``I'd just see the other one exploding.''
   His wife, Ellen, the astronaut's stepmother, did watch from a
VIP viewing site at the space center.
   ``She sat quietly with some of our people'' as the first space
shuttle since Challenger rose from the launchpad, said Alan Helman,
founder and chairman of the Astronauts Memorial Foundation.
   It was clearly an emotional time for her, said Arnold Richman, a
spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``We just hugged and cried,'' he said.
   At her home in Kona, Hawaii, Mitsue Onizuka, mother of
Challenger mission specialist Ellison Onizuka, said she clapped and
prayed for the five-man crew as Discovery's powerful rockets fired
the shuttle into orbit.
   ``It all went so smoothly. I prayed for them,'' she said. ``I
was really happy for them.''
   The launch helped ease the pain of her son's death, she said.
   Claude Onizuka, another of her sons, traveled to the Kennedy
Space Center to watch the launch. On Monday, he sent coffee,
macadamia nuts and pineapple from Hawaii to officials at mission
control, just as his brother had before his first spaceflight in
January 1985.
   ``It was Ellison's dream to see the program progress,'' Onizuka
said last week before flying to Florida. ``If Ellison were alive,
he'd like to see it fly.''
   Onizuka and Smith's son, Scott, watched the launch with the
families of the Discovery astronauts on the roof of a NASA building
nine miles from the pad, NASA officials said. They were kept away
from reporters and NASA had no comment on their reaction.
   The other astronauts killed in the disaster were commander Dick
Scobee, Ronald McNair, Judith Resnik and teacher Christa McAuliffe.
   McAuliffe's son, Scott, a sixth-grader, and daughter, Caroline,
a third-grader, were in their Concord, N.H., school, where no
classes were allowed to watch the live TV coverage of the launch.

   Now that he isn't prosecuting former public
officials the independent counsel who conducted the case that ended
in former presidential aide Michael K. Deaver's perjury conviction
is ready to hit the college speaking circuit.
   A former Justice Department official says Independent Counsel
Whitney North Seymour Jr. circulated a letter to colleges and
universities in July _ before Deaver's sentencing this month _
offering to speak as a paid expert on government ethics.
   ``If he's so concerned about ethics, let him take his expenses
and speak for free,'' said Gary L. McDowell, a research fellow at
the National Legal Center for the Public Interest. McDowell said he
received the letter from a friend, whom he wouldn't identify.
   ``As a result of my indoctrination in the ways of Washington as
independent counsel in the Deaver case, I have developed quite
strong views on how to achieve a higher standards of ethics in
government,'' Seymour wrote under the letterhead of his New York
law office.
   Seymour refused to comment about the letter to The Associated
Press, but in an interview published in Thursday's editions of The
New York Times, Seymour defended the speaking engagements, saying
his fee of $2,500 to $5,000 per appearance was ``way below

   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel says he
expects the recommendations of an interagency review committee to
help prevent the century-long buildup of dead trees that made this
summer's fires in Yellowstone National Park so destructive.
   But the National Park Service's chief ranger in Yellowstone said
controlled burning hasn't been done there before because the park's
most prominent tree, the lodgepole pine, is almost impossible to
burn under control.
   Hodel told two Senate subcommittees on Thursday that he and
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng had asked a panel of experts to
propose changes in the Park Service ``let it burn'' policy that had
led to this summer's disaster y Dec. 15.
   ``I would expect them to come back with a recommended means of
trying to reduce the fuel. I don't think anybody can tell me what
that will be,'' Hodel said at a hearing of the agriculture,
nutrition and forest subcommittee of the Agriculture Committee and
the public lands and parks subcommittee of the Energy and Natural

<HEAD>Du Pont to Begin Production of Substitute for Ozone-Destroying
Chemical</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co. says it will spend more than $25
million to begin commercial production in 1990 of a substitute for
the chemical in auto air conditioners that is considered one of the
most culpable substances in destroying the Earth's ozone layer.
   The company said Thursday it will install a unit at its Corpus
Christi, Texas, plant to make HFC-134a, a short-lived fluorocarbon
containing no chlorine that the company intends to sell for the
refrigeration uses of CFC-12, one of the chlorofluorocarbon or CFC
compounds.
   Du Pont is ``taking a significant risk, but a risk our board of
directors insists we take'' in deciding on production before the
completion of toxicity testing, said Joseph P. Glas, director of Du
Pont's Freon products division.
   Since it contains no chlorine, the new compound has no effect on
the ozone layer that keeps those cancer-causing rays from reaching
the surface of the earth, when it breaks up in the atmosphere.
   It takes the powerful ultraviolet rays of the sun, normally
shielded by ozone high in the stratosphere, to break up CFC
molecules, which liberate their chlorine to attack the ozone.
   Major producing nations agreed last year to cut CFC production
by 50 percent in 1998, but the Environmental Protection Agency said
Monday its latest analyses show the compounds should be banned
around the world.

<TEXT>
   The 1988 Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to U.N.
peacekeeping groups, does not include one of the world's major
peacekeeping forces, which was kept from the honor by the politics
of the Middle East.
   The 2,500 men and women of the Multinational Force and Observers
police the border between Egypt and Israel. If not for political
considerations, they would be wearing the powder blue berets of the
United Nations peacekeeping forces instead of their burnt orange.
   The force was organized by the United States to man the border
between Egypt and Israel after Israeli troops evacuated the Sinai
Peninsula on April 25, 1982, under the Arab world's first peace
treaty with the Jewish state.
   Then-President Jimmy Carter, who interceded with the unfriendly
neighbors to negotiate first the Camp David Accords in 1978, then
the 1979 treaty, wanted a U.N. force to legitimize the pact.
   Faced with an expected veto by the Soviet Union in the U.N.
Security Council, however, Carter decided to set up the force
himself.
   U.S., Colombian and Fijian infantrymen patrol the 250-mile
length of the Sinai in white pickup trucks or stand guard in
whitewashed watch towers.
   Italian members in revamped, white-painted minesweepers based at
Sharm el-Sheikh on the southern tip of Sinai chug about in the
Strait of Tiran at the strategic southern entrance of the Gulf of
Aqaba.
   Former Director General Peter D. Constable wrote in his 1988
annual report that their mission, simply stated, is: ``Observe and
report.''
   There has been no serious breach of the peace in the more than
six years that the force has been in place. But in November 1985, a
plane carrying 248 U.S. servicemen, who had just finished their
tour of duty in the Sinai, and eight crewmen crashed in Gander,
Newfoundland, killing all on board.
   In Oslo, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced Thursday that
it was honoring U.N. peacekeepers in the Middle East, Cyprus and
the Indian subcontinent for their help in ``reducing the level of
conflict even though the fundamental causes of the struggles
frequently remain.''

record $277,200, Sotheby's auction house said.
   The price for the coin Thursday set an auction record for an
Islamic coin and for any coin auctioned in Britain, the firm said.
   ``It was bought with a telephone bid by a Middle Eastern
collector who has asked us not to identify him,'' said Tim Eden,
head of the firm's coins department.
   The seller also remained anonymous.
   The pure gold coin dinar is 3@4-inch in diameter and nearly 13
centuries old. Mohammed died in A.D. 632 and the coin was made in
696.
   At the time, the power and influence of the Islamic empire
extended through Iraq, Arabia, the Middle East and parts of North
Africa, and was based in Damascus.
   ``When the Moslems wanted to introduce their own coins they knew
only Byzantine and Persian coins, so initially they simply adapted
them and added Arabic inscriptions,'' Eden said.
   ``It wasn't until ... 696 A.D. that they finally introduced
their own, purely Islamic coins and we were selling an example. I
suppose there aren't more than 10 to 20 like it left in the
world,'' he said.

   The decision of an international arbitration
panel to back Egypt on a disputed beachfront has created a major
issue in Israel's election campaign.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the hardline Likud bloc,
used the panel's ruling to push his view that Israel should not
agree to an international conference on Middle East peace.
   ``It was proven yet again that an international arbitrage always
harms Israel's interests, and Taba is not an exception,'' Shamir
said on Israel Television Thursday.
   ``This is a lesson for the future,'' said Shamir. He said the
rival left-leaning Labor Party has wrongly pushed for arbitration
rather than talks with Egypt to resolve the dispute.
   However, Energy Minister Moshe Shachal of the Labor Party said
at a news conference in Tel Aviv that Shamir ``preferred narrow
party interests to national and ... to the real solution of the
Taba problem.''
   ``We could have reached a compromise, but he preferred to ignore
the problems and to bring the situation to the point of no
return,'' Shachal said Thursday.
   Shamir fears an international forum would force Israel to make
territorial concessions on the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
territories the Jewish state has occupied since the 1967 Middle
East war. Labor favors such an international conference.
   The future of the West Bank and Gaza with their 1.5-million
Palestinian population is the focal point of the Parliament
elections scheduled for Nov. 1. The territories have been torn by
an anti-Israeli uprising since December.
   The international arbitration panel, in its decision published
Thursday in Geneva, awarded five key disputed border points to
Egypt.
   The five-member arbitration team is made up of members from
Sweden, France, Switzerland, Egypt, and Israel. They ruled 4-1 with
the Israeli member opposed. An arbitration agreement signed on
Sept. 11, 1986, commits Egypt and Israel to carry out the ruling.
   However, the decision does not actually give Taba, a 250-acre
beachfront resort, to Egypt. Though Egypt won key boundary markers,
Israeli officials said more bilateral talks are needed to draw the
actual border line.

<HEAD>Discovery Launch Releases Strong Emotion At Space Centers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For all the prelaunch claims of
confidence, Discovery's end to a painful 32-month U.S. hiatus from
space filled the nation's space centers with jubilation, and nearly
as much relief.
   The directors, the rocket scientists, the engineers, the
technicians, the security guards and the janitors joined in a
catharsis of roaring cheers and unstoppable tears Thursday.
   ``I was quite surprised at my emotions,'' admitted J. Wayne
Littles, a veteran of years of launches and now director of science
and engineering at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
``I hollered. It was a tremendous feeling of accomplishment to get
the launch behind us.''
   ``It's a great relief to see a perfect launch again,'' added
Tommy Harris, a Marshall engineer. ``We've been working so long on
this thing.''
   As he and other NASA officials had said earlier, Kennedy Space
Center director Forrest McCartney repeated that every launch has
risk and each is special.
   But some are more special.
   ``Unique! Super! Great! All those good words,'' McCartney said,
smiling broadly and grabbing hands to shake.
   ``It's an indescribable boost to morale,'' he said. ``The sole
job of these people is to do what they did today. It's been a very
long time for them. This was their living, their masterpiece,
today.''
   Hundreds of workers not involved in the launch left their posts
Thursday morning to watch Discovery blast brilliantly away from
Launchpad 39B. Challenger had left from the same spot Jan. 26,
1986, exploding 73 seconds later, killing seven astronauts and
triggering upheaval and uncertainty in the U.S. space program.
   Some said they couldn't hold back their tears and shook with
emotion at the launch they hoped would revitalize the U.S. space
program.
   ``Everybody's going out to buy a house now,'' said a security
guard as the workers shook hands and began laughing on their way
back to work.
   Some of the strongest emotions were at the Morton Thiokol plant
near Brigham City, Utah. The company became indelibly imprinted
with the Challenger tragedy after investigation blamed failure of a
sealing ring on one of the twin solid rocket boosters it designed
for the shuttles.
   ``Reputations are very fragile. Once they are damaged, it takes
a long time to fix them,'' said Dick Davis, a Thiokol vice
president and program manager. ``The way to put them back together
is to have successful launches.''
   After listening to Davis by telephone hookup from Kennedy Space
Center, Mel Rogers, who works on the booster's nozzles, said: ``It
felt good to hit something positive for once. The things are hard
enough to make, let alone be criticized.''
   Had something gone wrong, he said, ``I'd have had to move.''
   ``When you work on a program as long as we have, whenever a
space shuttle flies, it does bring a tear to your eye,'' said Mike
Ayers, director of finance for the company's space operations.
``Any space shuttle flight is an emotional experience, especially
for the employees who worked so hard to put the shuttle back into
flight.''
   Ribbons and clothing in green for ``Go'' and buttons showing the
Discovery crew with the unofficial theme ``Back to the Future''
were worn by thousands of space workers. Their ranks had little to
do with their immediate reactions.
   ``I got a cold chill. It was great,'' said Lois Veder, a
saleswoman at NASA's gift shop at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.,
where Discovery is scheduled to return to Earth on Monday.
   ``They just loved seeing that shuttle fly again,'' said Marion
LaNasa, spokesman for Martin-Marietta Manned Space Systems in New
Orleans. ``From the janitors to the engineers, all 3,500 employees
feel a very personal tie to the shuttle. We have all suffered with
NASA for the last 32 months, and we celebrate with them today.''
   ``This is a very, very special mission to us all,'' said John
Kaltenbach, an 18-year NASA employee who watched at Johnson Space
Center in Houston as a senior advance system specialist for
Lockheed Corp. ``There was probably more apprehension and
excitement in this one. This one had to fly.''

<HEAD>Conservationists Battle To Save Stranded Whales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housewives, local fishermen and
conservation officers worked frantically early today to save 39
whales stranded on a remote beach on the west coast of Australia.
   They said 21 of the beached mammals had already died near
Augusta, 150 miles south of Perth in Western Australia.
   The volunteers and others, numbering about 100 people in all,
stroked the creatures and kept them moistened through the night to
keep them alive.
   The school of 60 false killer whales are believed to have
beached themselves Wednesday night at the Scott River National
Park, just east of Augusta.
   The Department of Conservation and Land Management rushed
experts to the beach after the whales were found Thursday afternoon
scattered along a five mile stretch of beach. Volunteers soon
joined the rescue effort.
   Augusta Postmaster Gary Nash said, ``it will be a tough battle''
because access to the beach was hampered by thick forests.
   Many of the whales were battered by heavy surf this morning
while others were several yards up the beach and partly covered in
sand.
   Dave Mell, chief wildlife officer for the department, said they
wanted to move the 39 stricken whales six miles west to a sheltered
inlet and then lead them out to sea.
   Augusta was the site of a dramatic rescue operation in July 1986
when 140 false killer whales stranded themselves at another beach
near the town.
   That rescue operation, involving hundreds of volunteers, saved
all but a handful of the whales and captured worldwide headlines.
   Mell said it was hoped front end loaders and four-wheel-drive
vehicles would be able to transport the whales along the beach but
he said sections of the sand were ``soft and tricky'' for vehicles.
   ``Some of the whales look remarkably good and have weathered the
trauma of coming ashore quite well,'' he said. ``Some perished soon
after stranding.''
   ``One thing in our favour is the weather. Its cold and they need
to be keep wet and cool.''
   Volunteers braved cold conditions to stay with the stranded
whales through the night, with groups ``adopting'' individual
animals.
   Mell cautioned that the whales would drown if they were unable
to stay upright in the heavy surf, or if they overheated because
they were out of the water.
   The cause of the mass beaching is not known.

<HEAD>Berlin Brings Home Third World Ills to Finance Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's top officials on financial aid to poor
countries have left an annual congress for home with memories of
police sirens and demonstrators' chants.
   The officials from 151 countries say they are working at home
for exactly what the demonstrators in West Berlin demanded: an end
to hunger, poverty, illiteracy and damage to the environment in the
Third World.
   At the joint annual meeting of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, which ended Thursday, the staff's
final ``Urgent Notice'' said:
   ``The German authorities have advised that a demonstration is
scheduled to take place in the downtown area of (West) Berlin in
the late afternoon today. ... Participants who plan to leave .. .
are advised to check out of their hotels as soon as feasible to
avoid delays and missed flights.''
   Every night since Sunday, demonstrators poured into major
streets in downtown West Berlin, sometimes fighting riot police.
But most of the protesters just chanted slogans against the two
organizations.
   Many protesters were injured, but no serious casualties have
been reported. About 500 demonstrators were briefly detained and at
least one vehicle was set afire.
   The demonstrators made their point with slogans like ``Murder
Meeting!'' and signs that told the participants to go home and
count their money.
   At least one, Finance Minister J. B. Sumarlin of Indonesia,
agreed in a speech that some programs of the monetary fund did more
harm than good.
   The World Bank is the chief source of aid loans on easy
financial terms for Third World countries. The fund also lends
money to them and organizes loan packages.
   Borrowers and critics complain the austerity programs often
imposed with the loans hurt poor people.
   Michel Camdessus, managing director of the fund, says
governments inflict even more suffering on their people if they
refuse to make the policy changes it asks in return for loans.
   Many participants in the meeting were impressed by the
atmosphere in Berlin. They have never had so much public attention.
Meetings usually take place in Washington, a city not given to
street confrontations.
   Barber B. Conable, president of the bank, told reporters that he
had no time to make contact with the opposition.
   ``I realize that they question the effectiveness of World Bank
programs,'' he said. ``I think we must carry a burden of
explanation as to our use of public moneys.''
   The opposition was organized by left-wing groups.
   But there was no sign of participation by the German Democratic
Republic on the other side of the Berlin wall. Its Communist
leaders are reported to want to join the bank and fund and secure
loans in hard currency.

   Students glued to TV sets in school cafeterias and auditoriums
nationwide erupted in cheers, tears and applause as they watched
Discovery flawlessly lift off the launch pad.
   ``I had my fingers crossed the whole time,'' said Christy Holt,
a fifth-grader at Julian Harris Elementary School in Decatur, Ala.,
where about 80 children watched the launch Thursday.
   The school is on McAuliffe Drive, named for Christa McAuliffe,
the Concord, N.H., teacher who was killed in the Challenger
explosion on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The successful launch of Discovery came as a relief to teachers
who had to explain to their students what had happened 32 months
ago.
   Students of the next American teacher in line to fly aboard a
shuttle watched the liftoff at their school in McCall, Idaho. Their
teacher, Barbara Morgan, was in Florida for the launch as she was
for Challenger.
   ``We never had any doubt about putting the kids in there
again,'' said McCall-Donnelly Elementary School Principal John
Wall. ``We just needed to do it. I'm relieved everything went well.
I was more worried than I wanted to admit.''
   Although the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has
not set any date for civilians to return to space, Morgan was
enthusiastic about the possibility of flying aboard a shuttle.
   ``When they're ready to send me, I'll be there,'' she said.
   At an Ohio school with a library named after Challenger
astronaut and alumna Judith Resnik, students who felt a special
loss from the Challenger disaster were absorbed by Discovery's
launch.
   ``Suddenly, everyone became very observant,'' said Dennis Woods,
principal of Akron Firestone High School.
   ``That last 10 seconds, the kids were counting it off. When it
left the pad, there was a round of applause. Then there was a
period of ominous silence, as the kids remembered the Challenger.
When the rocket booster was released, that brought on another round
of applause.''
   Students at Challenger Junior High School in San Diego watched
the liftoff on television monitors in 30 classrooms. The students
earlier sent goodwill messages to the Discovery crew.
   Seventh graders in Rosemary Eskridge's science class at
Eisenhower Middle School in Oklahoma City were sophisticated enough
to hold their cheers until Discovery separated from its booster
rocket. It was at the separation stage that Challenger blew up.
   Donna Hanebut, a third grade teacher at Uintah Elementary School
in South Ogden, Utah, said ``there was lots of excitement and
apprehension'' among students she had led on an expedition last
summer to the U.S. Space Camp Training Center at Marshall Space
Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   At the camp, more than 100 students from grades two through high
school assembled at a pep rally for the launch.
   Chere Linwood, a third-grader from Davis Hills School, was among
those at the Space Camp for the liftoff and said she was scared.
``My mama told me to pray that they wouldn't die,'' she said.
   Students at Dick Scobee Elementary School in Auburn, Wash.,
watched the liftoff in tense silence.
   ``There was a lot of anxiety,'' said Principal Don Lapinski,
whose school was renamed for the Challenger pilot. ``My stomach was
in a knot, too.''
   Pink-clad students at Washington Elementary School in Willmar,
Minn., where Discovery astronaut George ``Pinky'' Nelson attended
fifth and sixth grades, counted down final seconds to liftoff and
then ``the entire student body started clapping,'' said Principal
Paul Olberg.
   Jean Bendezu, a seventh grade science student at Miami's Carver
Jr. High who plans to be an astronaut, said he was impressed with
the takeoff.
   ``Now I want to go to the university and learn about astronauts,
space and gravity,'' he said.
   But TV screens were dark in at least one school.
   At the Kimball School in Concord, N.H., where McAuliffe's two
children attend, Principal Clint Cogswell said no classes watched
the launch. He said he and his staff feel a duty to shield the
McAuliffe youngsters _ Scott, a sixth grader, and Caroline, a third
grader _ from reminders of the tragedy.

   The dollar inched down against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo on Friday, while stock prices rose moderately.
   The dollar closed the week at 134.30 yen, down 0.05 yen from
Thursday's close of 134.35 yen. After opening higher at 134.57 yen,
the currency ranged between 134.25 yen and 134.60 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
51.88 points Thursday, rebounded 223.54 points or 0.81 percent to

   The gain in Tokyo stock prices followed an overnight rise in the
Dow Jones industrial average on Wall Street.
   ``Participants traded a wide variety of issues, including steels
and leisure-related stocks,'' said an analyst with Nomura
Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   Although investors were still concerned about the condition of
ailing Emperor Hirohito, ``they are confident about Japan's
economic outlook,'' he said.
   On the foreign exchange market, many corporate players remained
on the sidelines because of the end today of the first half of the
Japanese fiscal year and the lack of significant market-affecting
news, dealers said.

   Without much fanfare, a new
tradition was initiated at Kennedy Space Center in the hours before
the shuttle Discovery lifted off.
   An American flag was unfurled in the firing room as the rotating
service structure was rolled away from the spacecraft Wednesday
afternoon. It will remain there in the launch control center until
the astronauts return to Earth on Monday and leave Discovery.
   ``It was not a very formal sort of thing,'' said NASA spokesman
Hugh Harris. ``You don't take time out of the countdown. It was
just as the announcement was made that the rotating service
structure was being retracted that the string was pulled and the
flag rolled down.''

   People across the country will be
able to listen to live space-to-ground communications throughout
the shuttle Discovery's flight.
   The ``Dial-a-Shuttle'' service is sponsored by the National
Space Society. AT&T's DIAL-IT 900 Services will be used to
establish the earth-to-space link, Harry Baumgartner, a spokesman
for the company, said Thursday.
   The service became available at 7:59 a.m. Thursday, two hours
before the launch had been scheduled, to callers who dialed
900-909-6272, said Kip Tarpley, a spokesman for the society.
   Callers can hear live conversations between the five astronauts
and mission control in Houston, Tarpley said. During quiet time,
news updates, commentary, taped interviews and highlights of the
day's activities can be heard, he said.
   It costs $2 for the first minute and 45 cents for each
additional minute callers spend listening to the conversations.
Money earned from the service will be spent on space-related
programs, he said.
   The service is scheduled to end about two hours after the
shuttle lands Monday at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

   One of the many satellites crowding
the orbital skies above the Earth briefly threatened to affect the
launch of space shuttle Discovery.
   When liftoff of the spacecraft was delayed Thursday morning,
engineers in launch control at Cape Canaveral announced that though
the shuttle could be launched as late 2:30 p.m. EDT, there were two
brief periods that were restricted because of satellites passing
near Discovery's flight path.
   Officials at the Johnson Space Center said they received a
Collision Avoidance warning from the Air Force Missile Command,
which keeps track of the hundreds of satellites in orbit.
   Flight Director Gary Coen said the warning had no effect on the
Discovery mission because the shuttle was launched at 11:37 a.m.
EDT, almost a half hour before the first of the two resticted times.
   The satellites that triggered the warnings were not identifed by
the Air Force.

   Physicist James A. Van Allen said he was
rooting for a safe launch for the shuttle Discovery, but its
successful liftoff does not change his outlook that manned space
travel is slighting science.
   Van Allen, a pioneer in unmanned exploration from the earliest
days of ventures into space, grumbled even before the Challenger
disaster 32 months ago that the United States was putting too much
emphasis on manned flights and letting scientific experiments that
could fly on unmanned rockets languish.
   Van Allen, discoverer of the radiation belts that surround the
Earth and are named for him, and a team of University of Iowa
scientists designed instruments for the Jan. 31, 1958, launch of
Explorer 1, the first U.S. satellite.
   Van Allen also directed the Pioneer 10 program, a flyby probe to
Jupiter that continues to send back information.
   After 16 years, Pioneer 10 is 4 billion miles away from Earth
and traveling at 28,400 miles an hour. It is the most remote
man-made object in the universe.

   More than 1,000 journalists at a
remote press site cheered Discovery's majestic liftoff but
expressed disappointment that new safety rules prevented them from
a closer view.
   Prompted by Air Force concerns that the Complex 39 press site
could be bombarded by falling debris if the solid rocket boosters
malfunctioned, only 1,800 reporters were allowed to work from the
main press site, just over four miles from the launchpad. Daily
newspapers were allowed to have just two people at the main press
site.
   The alternate press site was more than six miles from the
launchpad.
   Despite the spectacular liftoff, reporters at the remote site
were envious of their colleagues who were closer to the launch pad
and expressed fears that additional restrictions may follow.
   Most of the journalists arrived at the mosquito-infested site
before dawn after driving in bumper-to-bumper traffic for up to two
hours from Titusville and Cocoa Beach.
   Reporters complained the lack of telephones, electricity and
work space limited their usefulness at the remote site.

<TEXT>
   South Korea's foreign minister says his
government would be willing to discuss withdrawal of U.S. military
forces from its territory only after serious negotiations with
North Korea on reducing tension.
   Rejecting familiar North Korean demands, Choi Kwang-soo said
Thursday night that ``the withdrawal of American forces from Korea
cannot be a precondition ... cannot be an obstruction to serious
serious negotiations between the two parts of Korea.
   ``But we are prepared to consider the reduction ... in
consultation with your (U.S.) government if we have successful
negotiations with North Korea for reduction of tension,'' the
minister said in reply to questions from an audience of 300 at the
Washington World Affairs council.
   Choi said South Korea had expressed its sentiments to North
Korea, the Soviet Union and China, and he hopes the two communist
powers will influence their ally toward dialogue.
   The United States has an estimated 40,000 ground and air forces
based in South Korea.
   Describing U.S. forces in Korea as a deterrent threatening no
one, Choi said, ``We have made it known to North Korea, to the
Soviet Union, to the Chinese that withdrawal of American forces ...
is one of the main topics that has to be tackled in negotiations
for peace and stability'' _ but only after ending tension and
mistrust between the two Koreas and reaching an accord.
   ``The vast majority of (South) Korean people'' want them to stay
as a vital deterrent against resumption of hostilities by the
North, Choi said of U.S. troops that have been in South Korea since
the 1950-53 Korean War. Choi described recent anti-American
flareups in his country as the work of ``a few radical students.''
   ``Public airing of anti-American sentiments is a testament to
the new pluralism, and political liberalization in full swing in
(South) Korea,'' he said in a prepared speech preceding the
30-minute question-and-answer session.
   Choi confirmed reports of Seoul's expanding contacts with
Beijing and Moscow. U.S.-Soviet relations ``have reached a new
plateau,'' and this is ``good news for Korea,'' he said, describing
a trend of ``substantial progress in unofficial relations'' with
China and increasing contacts with Moscow.
   The Soviet Union, despite providing vast amounts of military aid
including sophisticated weapons to North Korea, and China are
demonstrating today that they have a stake in peace and regional
stability, Choi said. ``In this spirit, we are trying our best to
improve our relations with these two powers,'' with one of the
goals being ``to influence North Korea,'' he added.
   Choi said South Korean President Roh Tae-woo's July 7 proposals
on reducing tension and ending confrontation between North and
South Korea and their respective allies already have helped produce
a Hungarian-South Korean agreement to pursue full diplomatic
relations. But South Korean is waiting for a positive response from
North Korea he said.
   The minister flew to Washington for his appearance and was
returning to New York to prepare for the planned appearances of
both South and North Korea before the U.N. General Assembly.

   Protesters hurled firebombs into U.S.
Army headquarters in Seoul today and fled before riot police could
intervene, authorities said.
   Police and U.S. military authorities said the firebombs did not
cause any damage when they were hurled over a wall into a motor
pool at the headquarters of the 8th U.S. Army in a central district.
   South Korea has been hit by a burst of anti-American sentiment
provoked by several incidents during the Olympics. Radical students
have staged anti-American protests to try and play up the issue.
   Police said nine people were involved in the attack and police
officers chased the attackers, but failed to catch any of them.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said more than 20 youths
were involved in the incident and they appeared to be students. The
agency said four firebombs were hurled and the attackers left 15
more behind.
   A U.S. military spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said it was the second firebomb attack on U.S. military facilities
following a similar incident earlier this year. A window was broken
in the first incident.
   Shortly before the attack, police broke up a group of about 30
students from Dongguk University who scattered anti-American
leaflets near the U.S. base. Police arrested seven of the students
who scattered leaflets saying ``Punish the Yankees.''
   About 42,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea under a mutual
defense treaty.
   About 50 students with firebombs and clubs later held a rally at
Dongguk to denounce the United States. They brandished the weapons
at riot police outside the school, but there was no clash and
students dispersed peacefully.
   A group of students presented a letter today to the U.S. Embassy
protesting the behavior of American athletes and journalists during
the Olympics.
   ``The incidents are clear evidence that Americans are slighting
the Korean people,'' the letter said.
   U.S. athletes and media have been criticized by some South
Koreans for their conduct during the Olympics, which end Sunday.
   South Korean newspapers have attacked NBC for its coverage of an
attack by South Korean boxing officials on a referee who awarded a
match against a local favorite. The lax conduct of the U.S. team at
the Games' opening ceremony and the arrest of three American
athletes have spurred further criticism.
   The United States and South Korea are close allies and the
government has moved to defuse the anti-American outbursts by
reminding Koreans of the close ties between the two nations.

<HEAD>New Yorker Cartoonist Who Inspired Addams Family TV Show Dies</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   NEW YORK _ Cartoonist Charles Addams, whose macabre characters
and morbid humor haunted the pages of The New Yorker magazine for
half a century and spawned ``The Addams Family'' TV show of the
1960s, has died. He was 76.
   Addams died Thursday in the emergency room at St. Clare's
Hospital and Health Center, said Mary Alice Gregg, a hospital
administrator.
   He suffered a heart attack in his car in front of his Manhattan
apartment building, said his wife, Marilyn.
   ``He's always been a car buff, so it was a nice way to go,''
said Mrs. Addams, who married her husband in a pet cemetery in 1980.
   ``He thought it would be nice and cheerful,'' she said of the
wedding.
   His first cartoon was published in The New Yorker in 1935, but
his first major one was published there on Jan. 13, 1940. It showed
a woman skier whose tracks passed neatly but inexplicably on both
sides of a large tree.
   ``I can't imagine the magazine without him,'' said Robert
Gottlieb, the magazine's editor.
   Addams, born in Westfield, N.J., doodled skulls and bones for
his high school newspaper before studying further at Colgate
University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Grand Central
School of Art in New York.
   His ghoulish characters, whose rundown Victorian mansion was
crowded with infernal devices and lurking creatures, was the
inspiration for ``The Addams Family'' television show of the 1960s.
   The Addamses, from Morticia the black-gowned matriarch, to Lurch
the giant butler and Thing, a hand that popped out of a box, were
directly inspired by Addams cartoons.
   Addams has produced 10 cartoon collections that have together
sold more than 460,000 copies.
   The New York Times art critic John Russell called Addams ``an
American landmark, one of the few by which one and all have learned
to steer.''
   But Russell said: ``Ghouls and ghosts are not the whole of
Addams. The jokes are so good that we do not notice the sturdiness
of the line, the rock-solid composition, the eye for scale and
placement, the calculated ordinariness that lures us into the
trap.''
   Some of Addams' cartoons take a moment to figure out.
   In one, a bus driver looks disquieted because the next stop
buzzer has just been pulled. After a moment, the reader usually
notices that the bus is approaching a rain-swept graveyard and no
one but the driver is on board.
   In another, four scouts cross a brook on a fallen tree carrying
a banner that says ``Beaver Patrol.'' Each of the scouts has buck
teeth and the reader is left to wonder whether the tree fell
because of beavers or the patrol.
   Although he profited immensely from his work, Addams said he did
not reap large direct benefits from the television show.
   ``They gave me money each week, but after the first runs ended I
didn't get anything. No residuals. This was a mistake made by the
big, old, fat law firm I let represent me,'' Addams once said.
   John O'Hara, a friend of Addams, said his drawings belied his
personality.
   ``I don't think he'd hurt a fly,'' he said. ``I never have seen
him lose his temper, although that is not to say he doesn't get
mad. He happens to be what is called easygoing, and has a decent
contempt for the opinions of mankind.''
   New Yorker spokeswoman Rhonda Pinzer said the magazine still has
some covers and cartoons that Addams had submitted, and probably
will run in the future.
   Mrs. Addams said the funeral would be private.

<TEXT>
   A free-spending insurance executive
making his first bid for office holds a commanding lead over
three-term Republican Gov. Arch Moore, who has made a career of
overcoming political hardship.
   Gaston Caperton spent a record $2.1 million in the primary in a
state where fellow Democrat and former Gov. Jay Rockefeller made
deep-pocket politics common. He won't say how much he'll spend on
the general election.
   Moore has been unusually successful in a state where registered
Democrats have a 2-to-1 advantage, but a poll in late August and
early September gave Caperton a 60-31 percent lead, and many
Democrats whose support Moore needs expressed reluctance to cross
party lines again.
   In a speech earlier this month, Moore said the poll, conducted
for The Associated Press, Charleston Daily Mail and WSAZ-TV, gives
him ``one heck of a heartburn.'' But he called it an ``aberration.''
   A feisty campaigner who defies categorization as a conservative
or liberal, Moore often fares poorly in early polls. He trailed
John Raese early in the race for the GOP nomination this year and
still won, by a 53-47 percent margin.
   Caperton, whose McDonough Caperton Insurance Group is the
nation's 18th-largest insurance company, suggested Moore is in
trouble in this financially ailing state, where coal and other
backbone industries are in a slump.
   ``The story in the primary was not that Arch Moore came from
behind and won. The story is that an incumbent governor only got 53
percent of the vote,'' Caperton said.
   Moore, 65, has portrayed the 48-year-old Caperton as a rich kid
who's trying to buy the election, referring to him once as ``Cash
and Spend-a-ton.''
   But Moore also is spending freely, starting his TV advertising
in early summer, far before the traditional Labor Day start of the
political season. He spent $716,000 on the primary.
   Moore served six straight terms in Congress, then won election
as governor in 1968. In 1972, using a just-approved constitutional
amendment, he became the first West Virginia governor to succeed
himself, defeating Rockefeller.
   Before leaving office under a constitutional provision barring a
third straight term, Moore was indicted on charges of trying to get
a charter for a new bank in exchange for $25,000. He was acquitted.
   He lost a bid for the U.S. Senate in 1978 and lost the
governor's race to Rockefeller in 1980 before making a comeback in
1984 against Clyde See.
   Revenue during Moore's third term has slumped, and the governor
was forced to borrow $80 million this year to keep the state
running. West Virginia didn't send out its 1987 income tax refunds
until last week.
   Moore said the Democratic-controlled Legislature has rebuffed
many of his efforts to improve the economy. He maintains that the
state is in recovery, and his schedule is filled with plant
openings and announcements of grants.
   ``I don't think the people are going to be fooled by ribbon
cuttings,'' Capterton said. ``He cannot fool the people of West
Virginia that he's done a good job when the reality is different
from what it is in his ads.''

<HEAD>U.S. Protests Seizure Of Military Equipment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAFAEL CANDANEDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLON, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Southern Command vigorously
protested the seizure of a shipment of U.S. military equipment that
Panamanian officials said may have been destined for
anti-government groups.
   The protest on Thursday came after Attorney General Carlos
Villalaz announced that customs agents had seized the
U.S.-registered ship Ambassador and its cargo. Panama said it
discovered a 120mm cannon and other war materiel inside sealed
containers on board the vessel.
   The cargo, identified on the ship's manifest as ``general
merchandise,'' was destined for the Southern Command, Villalaz told
a news conference in this Atlantic port city located 50 miles north
of Panama City.
   He said the attempted delivery of war materiel in the civilian
port violated the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties.
   The Southern Command is based in the former Canal Zone and
oversees all U.S. military operations in Latin America.
   Villalaz said that for security reasons, the government
prohibits ships from carrying arms into Las Minas port, 10 miles
east of Colon. A refinery based in Las Minas processes crude oil
imports for Panamanian consumption.
   The Ambassador, which arrived Wednesday from Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., and its cargo were seized on Thursday.
   A Southern Command spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the shipment was legal under the treaties and that
the Southern Command had ``vigorously protested'' the incident.
   He said a U.S. military officer was denied access to the cargo
shipment.
   ``They illegally seized equipment belonging to the United States
Army,'' the spokesman said, adding it was the first time Panama had
confiscated U.S. military equipment.
   Villalaz said customs agents discovered the cannon and two
five-ton troop transport vehicles on board the Ambassador. Customs
officials suspected that boxes yet to be opened contained munitions
and arms, he said.
   Villalaz suggested the arms could have been used by opponents of
the government, which is controlled by Defense Forces commander
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Authorities arrested 26 opposition activists last week and
accused them of involvement in a U.S.-sponsored subversion plan.
The U.S. Embassy denied the charge.
   The Reagan administration has imposed economic sanctions against
Panama in a bid to force the ouster of Noriega, who is under U.S.
indictment on drug trafficking charges.
   The Southern Command spokesman refused to identify the equipment
on board the Ambassador but said the 120mm cannon was ``totally
useless and sent to Panama to be used in a testing center, where
the effects of tropical conditions on munitions storage are
tested.''
   Under the canal treaties, the United States is to turn over
control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.

   The dollar inched down against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices rebounded moderately on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average recouped 223.67 points, or
0.81 percent, to close at 27,923.67. The index quickly gained
143.82 points to move to 27,843.98 shortly after the market opened
and gradually rose.
   The dollar finished the week's trading at 134.30 yen, down 0.05
yen from Thursday's close of 134.35 yen. The U.S. currency opened
higher at 134.57 yen before falling slightly, and it ranged between
134.25-134.60 yen.
   The dollar's strength on Wall Street boosted the currency in
Tokyo, but it did not rise further in thin trading. Traders stayed
on the sidelines because today was the last day of the first half
of the fiscal year, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The release of Japanese trade figures today did not affect the
market, and the yen rose slightly toward the end of trading when
some investors sold dollars on profit-taking, the dealer said.
   The Finance Ministry said Japan's trade surplus for August
shrank to $5 billion from $6.5 billion.
   ``Share prices were higher almost across the board,'' said
Toshiyuki Nishiguchi with Daiwa Securities. ``Ever since the new
fiscal year started Tuesday, participants have been trading a wide
variety of issues,'' he said.
   ``Investors became optimistic because Japan's current economic
outlook is pretty good,'' Nishiguchi added.
   Trading was moderate with volume on the first section estimated
at 1 billion shares. Steel and shipbuilding stocks as well as
chemicals and oils that have been slow movers attracted
participants, Nishiguchi said.

<HEAD>ACLU Advertises To Defend Its Image</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union says
despite attacks by Vice President George Bush its only cause is the
Bill of Rights, and it will embark on a $250,000 effort to tell
Americans just that.
   Dan Goldberg, chairman of the ACLU Foundation of Southern
California, announced the campaign Thursday at a news conference
and played two commercials taped for the organization by actor Burt
Lancaster, who tells viewers: ``I have a confession to make. I'm a
card-carrying member of the ACLU.''
   The reference to being a ``card-carrying member'' is the same
one the George Bush has used to describe his Democratic rival for
the presidency, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Bush claims
Dukakis' ACLU membership shows how out of touch he was with
Americans.
   Dukakis has not defended the organization, even during last
Sunday's presidential debate. The day afterward his campaign issued
a list of ACLU positions with which he disagrees.
   Other commercials for the 68-year-old ACLU will be made next
week by Jill Eikenberry and Michael Tucker, the husband-and-wife
actors who portray married lawyers on the ``L.A. Law'' television
series.

   State Republican Party officials and the
state director of George Bush's presidential campaign are
disavowing any connection with an advertisement against Michael
Dukakis sponsored by a group called Greeks Against Dukakis.
   Republican George Shissias of Columbia said he wanted to welcome
Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen to town
Wednesday, so he took out the full-page advertisement in The
(Columbia) State headlined ``Hazards of Duke.''
   Bentsen canceled his trip, but the ad ran Wednesday anyway.
   The content of the newspaper ad is based on a Republican
National Committee publication called ``The Hazards of Duke,'' a
312-page volume of issues and quotes to use against Dukakis.
   Shissias said Wednesday he collected money to pay for the ad and
hired a professional agency in Columbia to produce it. The ad,
which appeared only in The State, said: ``Paid for by Greeks
Against Dukakis; Steve Moskos, chairman (Charleston); John
Raftakis, vice chairman (Anderson); George Shissias, treasurer

   Actor Robert Redford, who has
denounced comparisons between him and Republican Dan Quayle as
``Quayle droppings,'' couldn't resist a bit of fun when he joined
Democratic presidential candidate Micheal Dukakis on the campaign
trail.
   ``Hello, everybody, I'm Dan Quayle,'' Redford said told a crowd
of several thousand when he stepped to the microphone to introduce
the Massachusetts governor.
   Redford said he supported Dukakis because ``we can't sit back
for another eight years of neglect and abuse of our environment.''
   The Republican vice presidential candidate's blond good looks
have been compared with Redford's since 1980, when Quayle first ran
for the Senate, and the comparison resurface after Quayle was
picked as George Bush's running mate.
   In fact, Quayle associates have said that the Indiana senator's
political aspirations had been inspired in part by ``The
Candidate,'' a 1972 film in which Redford starred as a young
politician.
   ``This whole thing sounds like Quayle droppings to me,'' Redford

   ``The election of leaders in this country is far more important

<HEAD>Pastors, Parishioners Appeal Plan To Close 43 Detroit Parishes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-three of 112 Roman Catholic churches here
have been recommended for closure in what could be the country's
biggest wave of church closings, but some pastors and parishioners
have vowed to resist the plan.
   ``It's more than shocking,'' said the Rev. Anthony Helinski,
whose St. Ignatius of Antioch would merge with another
congregation. ``It's an insult. It's unfair. It's un-Christian.''
   The proposal presented Wednesday after a four-year study would
affect mostly inner-city parishes that have had a sharp decline in
their congregations and have aging, 19th-century churches that are
costly to maintain and operate.
   ``We want an alive, vibrant parish that really makes a
difference in this area, the community,'' Cardinal Edmund Szoka,
archbishop of the diocese, said after a closed-circuit broadcast to
parishes outlining the recommendations.
   ``Money certainly has to be a consideration. We live in a world
where we need money.''
   By Thursday, at least 20 parishes targeted to close said they
would appeal the recommendations.
   One pastor who planned to appeal was the Rev. Casimir Butkus,
whose St. Peter's parish is predominantly Lithuanian.
   ``Under the czars, churches are closed, under the communists,
under the Germans, and now the same thing from their own
archbishop,'' he said.
   ``It's not over 'til it's over,'' said Joe Rivers, 69, a
parishioner at St. Bernard's. ``We're not giving up. We're going to
fight it.''
   Most of the targeted parishes are in areas of the city that have
been depopulated by the migrigation to the suburbs in recent
decades.
   Joseph Madison, president of the Michigan Leadership Conference,
said the closings are ``symptomatic of a decaying city.''
   ``I don't think you could find a single historical parallel to
this,'' said Msgr. John Tracy Ellis, a historian at Catholic
University in Washington, D.C.
   ``They're closing up parishes and there will be more of them
(closings) in the future if the present conditions continue _ but
not anywhere near this number.''
   Detroit isn't alone in facing urban pressures. The Chicago
Archdiocese announced plans last year to close two landmark
churches and indicated that as many as 25 other inner-city churches
may be abandoned.
   Still, the recommendations here shocked many church members.
   ``When you take away our church, you're playing with our
souls,'' said Georgia Hernandez, who attends St. Charles Borromeo.
   The recommendations by the archdiocese's City-Church Task Force
would reduce the city's 112 parish churches to 63 parishes, four
missions and two shrines, the archdiocese said Thursday. In
addition, some parishes would be merged. The churches targeted for
closure have about 10,000 members.
   Churches have until Oct. 13 to appeal to Bishop Patrick Cooney,
who supervised the study.
   Appeals hearings are to end by Dec. 15 and Szoka is to announce
his final ruling by early January. All closings and mergers must be
completed by June 30.
   The Detroit Archdiocese comprises 331 parishes in six counties
with about 1.5 million members.

   A woman separated from her husband has
sued the state, saying she shouldn't be forced to have a judge
determine the father of her 2{-year-old daughter before she can
choose the girl's last name.
   At stake in the lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court is
whether Betty Virella, who hasn't seen her husband in more than
seven years, can name her daughter Jacqueline after the girl's
father, James Aponte.
   Virella, 30, of Providence said the state Health Department has
refused to issue a birth certificate unless she agrees to use the
surname of her estranged husband, Victor Andino.
   ``I don't have a birth certificate for my daughter and she's 2{
years old now,'' Virella said. ``It's like Jacqueline is not in
this world.''
   Mary Ellen McCabe, the Health Department's chief legal counsel,
said the department seeks to protect the rights of the legal
father, who may not be the same as the biological father.
   Under Rhode Island law, a woman's husband is the legal father,
and her child must have the husband's surname unless there is a
court ruling that another man was the father, said McCabe, who
would not comment directly on Virella's case.
   Jean Rosiello, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who
represents Virella, said Virella had not sought a court order on
paternity and should not be forced to do so.
   ``Our point is that whether she can afford the expense of going
to Family Court, she has the right to choose the name of her
child,'' Rosiello said.
   Virella, who uses her maiden name, said she had to produce
records showing she had been pregnant, had given birth and that the
child was still alive to enroll Jacqueline in Aid to Families with
Dependent Children.
   An expert on vital statistics said policies dictating a child's
surname are becoming rare.
   ``There are not that many states that do it anymore,'' said Mary
Anne Freedman, director of health statistics in Vermont and past
president of the Association for Vital Records and Health
Statistics.
   ``Over the course of the past 20 years, parents have been naming
their childen with surnames that bear no relation to either the
father's or mother's names,'' she said.
   In a 1986 letter to Women & Infants Hospital, where Jacqueline
was born, the Health Department said that if a mother is married at
conception or birth, ``the parents may give the child any name they
wish as long as both parents sign the worksheet.''
   Virella said she was worried her estranged husband could someday
claim custody if the child bore his name.
   The choice of a surname ``is a legal matter which has a lot of
bearing on the rights of the child,'' said George Gay, chief of
registration methods at the National Center for Health Statistics.
   In most states, a court order on paternity would be the easiest
way to clear up the situation, he said.
   Virella said she left Andino 12 years ago when she moved to New
York City from Puerto Rico. She said she last saw Andino, who still
lives in Puerto Rico, more than seven years ago.
   She said her other daughter, Jennifer, 4, was born in New York
City and was allowed to have Aponte's surname.

   Here comes The Bride.
   And there she goes, around the far curve and past the checkered
flag _ driven by Camille Connolly, bridal shop owner by day, stock
car racer by night.
   The Bride, a 1983 Mercury Capri, sports a 2-foot bride doll
peeking out her rear window. It's to remind spectators at Santa Fe
Speedway in suburban Hinsdale just who is behind the wheel.
   Connolly says her shop customers often are shocked when they
make the connection between the 5-foot-2, 110-pound woman who
designed their wedding gown and the helmeted figure rocketing into
a curve like some kind of speed demon.
   ``They say, `We could never picture anybody like you doing
something like that,''' she said. ``I guess I don't have dirt under
my fingernails, or something.''
   Connolly, 52, began racing in 1977 in a 14-year-old Lincoln
Continental that her husband had bought for $35 and painted pink.
   ``This was going to be a one-night thing _ let's all have a big
laugh,'' Connolly said.
   ``It's one of those things that just has snowballed. ... Maybe
we just got lucky. We both hit on something we really enjoy,'' said
her husband, Bob, a used-car dealer who maintains his wife's racing
car. ``It beats playing bingo.''
   Connolly started racing in ``Powder Puff'' races reserved for
women, but soon graduated to the more competitive Lightning Rod
class, where she finished third last season. Results from this
season's races still are being tallied, but she has won several
times.
   The Lightning Rod class is one in which few women venture and
fewer remain.
   ``Probably because they don't realize how competitive it is, or
their cars didn't hold up, or they were afraid,'' she said.
   But for her fear is no problem.
   ``With anything like this there's a risk,'' she said. ``But we
do a lot to protect me in the car.''
   Danger is half the fun, added her husband, who is confident his
maintenance of the car will keep her safe.
   ``It's like people who jump out of airplanes,'' he said.
``Everybody knows that the risk is there. It's part of the
magnetism of the sport.''
   That hasn't stopped the couple's five children, ages 23 to 29,
from worrying.
   ``When I go to the track they'll say `Mom, be careful,'''
Camille Connolly said. ``I used to say that to them when they
started driving.''
   She has the name of her suburban Berwyn bridal shop, which she
took over from her mother, painted across the back of her car. But
what grabs attention is the doll, which Connolly adorns with a new
bridal dress three or four times a year _ only to see it muddied
the first time out.
   ``Some races you can't see her face _ it's all covered in mud,''
she said.
   But other drivers don't seem to care whether Connolly owns a
bridal shop or a muffler shop.
   ``You ride around the track and you look in your mirror, and
there's Camille,'' said George Hayes, who has raced against
Connolly for seven years. ``You can't shake her. She's always
competitive.''

   South Africa and Angola could accept a
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola within 24 months, but Cuba
wants more time, sources at U.S.-mediated talks said.
   As a result of the disagreement, the talks, which began Monday
with high expectations, ended Thursday without an agreement, the
sources said.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, they said delegations from
South Africa and Angola appeared to back the 24-month withdrawal
plan. Cuban diplomats demanded more time, the sources said.
   A communique from the negotiating teams in this central African
city said a new meeting would be scheduled again here at an
unspecified date.
   The timetable for withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cuban
troops again was the obstacle to an agreement, the sources said.
   South Africa withdrew its troops from Angola under a cease-fire
negotiated during the talks. It had demanded withdrawal of Cuban
troops within 12 months if it was to go ahead with its stated aimed
of granting independence to South-West Africa, Angola's southern
neighbor.
   Angola and Cuba initially demanded four years for the withdrawal.
   The communique released after the Brazzaville talks said the
participants would recommend to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar that plans for independence for South-West Africa, also
called Namibia, go ahead.
   In Kinshasa, Zaire, President Mobutu Sese Seko said today he
would meet with South African President P.W. Botha on Saturday in
Gdabo-Lite, his ancestral village in northern Zaire, to discuss
peace initiatives for southern Africa. South African Foreign
Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha was also to fly there for the talks,
which South Africa had requested, according to Zaire government
sources.
   The meeting was being billed as part of an African-led
initiative to negotiate an end to the Angolan civil war.
   U.S. diplomats had clearly hoped the Brazzaville talks would end
in a peace agreement which would clear the way for Angola's Marxist
government to begin talks with its anti-Marxist guerrillas.
   President Reagan told the United Nations on Monday that an
agreement that would result in the Cubans withdrawing from Angola
was near.

   Frost advisories were issued for parts of Wyoming and Colorado
today as fog covered many areas of the nation, dropping visibility
to zero in parts of Southern California.
   Chilly weather also settled elsewhere as temperatures fell to
the 40s in the Plains, the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles, the
northern Rockies and New England.
   Fog lowered visibility to zero at Camp Pendleton, Calif., and to
one-sixteenth of a mile at Long Beach, Calif. It also formed over
the upper Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley, Illinois, the Tennessee
Valley, the central Appalachians and North Carolina, but this fog
was expected to burn off by midmorning.
   Thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain in parts of Texas, and
showers were scattered in parts of Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida,
Colorado, Kansas, Missouri and Kentucky.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in Texas,
the lower Mississippi Valley, the central Gulf Coast region,
southern parts of the middle Mississippi Valley, Alabama, and parts
of Tennessee and New England. Cloudy to partly cloudy skies were
predicted for the central Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley and
the upper Great Lakes. The rest of the country should have mostly
sunny skies.
   Predicted high temperatures: 50s in western Kansas and northern
Maine; 60s in most of New York state, New England, the central
Plains, the central and southern Rockies, Oklahoma, and northwest
Texas; 90s in Southern California and California's and Oregon's
inland valleys; and 100 degrees in the desert Southwest. The
remainder of the nation should have highs in the 70s and 80s.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 32 degrees
at Laramie, Wyo., to 82 at Yuma, Ariz., and Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>King Says He Made His Point In Lawsuit, Despite Verdict Against
Him</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nearly seven years of court proceedings, it
took a jury just over two hours to reject the claim by former Gov.
Edward J. King that he was libeled by a 1981 political column in
The Boston Globe.
   But the former chief executive claimed he was vindicated anyway
because the verdict issued Thursday found one sentence in the
column was false.
   ``We did the very best we could,'' King said after the verdict
in Suffolk Superior Court. He said he did not consider the lawsuit
a waste of time because ``now we know that something the Globe
never retracted was a false statement.''
   King, who said earlier that he might run for governor again if
he prevailed, said he and his lawyer would decide whether to appeal
the ruling within 30 days. He had no comment on his political
plans, ifany.
   After six days of testimony, the jury returned a special verdict
slip that said former Globe columnist David Farrell was wrong when
he wrote in a Nov. 8, 1981, column that King called a judge to
demand harsher sentences in a gang-rape case.
   But when asked if they believed the statement discredited King
among ``any considerable and respectable class of the community,''
the jury answered no and decided the case in favor of the Globe.
King needed to prevail on each question on the verdict slip to win.
   John Driscoll, the newspaper's editor, said the verdict upheld
freedom of speech.
   ``After seven years of litigation, the jury has reaffirmed the
right of all people _ including columnists and cartoonists _ to
speak and write freely about the actions of government,'' Driscoll
said.
   Farrell, 62, who resigned from the Globe in 1985 and now works
in public relations, said he was relieved.
   ``I'm very pleased and I feel vindicated. I always felt I did a
good job writing the column,'' Farrell said. Asked if he still
believes King called the judge, Farrell said, ``Yes.''
   King, who joined the Republican party after losing the September
1982 Democratic primary to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, filed suit in
January 1982 against the Globe and several editorial employees,
seeking $3.6 million.
   King testified that the column amounted to a charge of
obstruction of justice and struck him like ``an ice pick in the
ribs,'' causing him to lose sleep on more than 1,000 nights.
   On cross-examination, King acknowledged that he never publicly
denied making the call. Globe attorney Joseph Kociubes argued that
King, who was thinking of suing the Globe before the column, did
not show evidence of financial, social or political harm.
   Farrell testified that he was told about King's purported call
to Judge Herbert Abrams by state Treasurer Robert Q. Crane, an old
friend of Farrell whom he considered a reliable source about
Massachusetts politics.
   Crane testified that he was the source, but could not recall who
told him about the call. Both King and Abrams swore that no call
took place.
   Under libel law, a public figure such as King has the burden of
showing not only that a publication was false but that it defamed
him. Further, the governor must have shown that the column was
published with ``actual malice'' _ that is, with knowing falsity or
with ``reckless disregard'' for the truth.

   A toxin produced by mold that is common
in corn during drought has been found in this year's Illinois corn
crop, preliminary test results indicate.
   State Agriculture Department officials said Thursday that 34
percent of the samples analyzed have been found to have aflatoxin
in levels higher than the federal Food and Drug Administration
permits without restricting use.
   Mark Randal, a spokesman for the state agency, said none of the
samples tested so far has shown levels higher than allowed for
restricted use by the FDA.
   He said corn prices shouldn't be affected if the levels stay
within the range allowed for restricted use.
   There are no restrictions on corn that contains less than 20
parts per billion of the toxin, he said.
   Randal said the FDA has issued temporary standards that limit
corn with aflatoxin levels ranging from 20 parts per billion to 100
parts per billion to use as feed for mature livestock such as beef
cattle, swine or poultry.
   The department so far has tested 58 of the 327 samples collected
from across the state by grain inspectors.
   ``A true indicator of statewide aflatoxin trends will not be
possible until all of those samples have been analyzed,'' according
to a department statement.

   A Taiwan business organization will send
an 80-member delegation to the Soviet Union next week in the first
such visit to the communist nation, a trade leader said today.
   Lin Tzy-ching, chairman of the Taiwan Importers and Exporters
Association, said the private group planned to buy raw materials
from Moscow and promote sales of Taiwan products to the Soviets.
   The visit has been sanctioned by the government, Lin said.
   ``We will see how good business opportunities are in the Soviet
Union and make suggestions to the government,'' he said.
   The group will leave Monday for Bangkok where it will fly to
Moscow for a 14-day visit, he added.
   Taiwan still bans direct trade with Soviet Union and Albania.
However, authorities have said this island's economic policies
should be independent from the government's anti-communist stance.
   Earlier this year, the Taiwan government announced measures to
encourage trade with seven East European countries, easing
restrictions and permitting direct imports of consumer goods from
East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia
and Yugoslavia.
   Industrialists have long urged the government to allow direct
trade with the Soviet Union, noting indirect trade with the Soviets
has accounted for more than half the total trade with East Europe.
   Last year, Taiwan's exports to East Europe totaled $7.5 million,
nearly double that of 1986. Imports from East European countries
totaled $190 million, a 119 percent increase from 1986.

   A small plane with three people aboard
crashed into the Hudson River near here, but the three were able to
swim ashore and hitch a ride to a hospital, officials said.
   The crash occurred late Thursday a few miles north of the George
Washington Bridge to New York City, officials said.
   The woman and two men walked into Palisades General Hospital's
emergency room around 10 p.m. and said they had hitched a ride in a
van, according to Tom Urban, the hospital's assistant vice
president.
   Police say the plane, a single-engine Cessna 172, was rented at
a Teterboro airport and originally was headed to Atlantic City. But
the pilot had changed direction and headed north to the Hudson
River for a sightseeing trip when the aircraft lost power about 200
yards off Edgewater, according to police.
   The three suffered abrasions.
   The woman also was treated for exposure and released from the
hospital early today, said Diane Pollock, a hospital spokeswoman.
The men were held for observation, she said.

<HEAD>Company Sees Launch As First Step To Rebuilding Reputation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The performance of Morton Thiokol's
booster rockets as they helped lift the space shuttle Discovery
into orbit drew cheers of relief from proud employees who saw it as
a first step toward rebuilding the company's reputation.
   ``Reputations are very fragile. Once they are damaged, it takes
a long time to fix them,'' said Dick Davis, vice president. ``The
way to put them back together is to have successful launches,''
   Employees at the rocket-maker's Wasatch Operations 25 miles west
of here erupted in cheers as they watched the launch on television
monitors. The jubilant scene Thursday was in stark contrast to 32
months before when a faulty seal on a Morton Thiokol booster caused
Challenger's destruction and grounded the nation's manned space
program.
   Morton Thiokol was held partly to blame for the accident. At one
point in the launch deliberations, a company official was ordered
to take off his engineering hat and put on his management hat.
Senior managers then overrode the objections of some engineers to a
cold-weather launch.
   Thursday, hundreds of Morton Thiokol officials and engineers
were at Cape Canaveral for the launch. Reporters were barred from
company premises in Utah, in part so employees could watch the
launch in private, said spokesman Rocky Raab.
   Davis spoke by telephone to the company's Utah employees minutes
after launch.
   ``I really want to thank the 3,000 people in Utah who put
themselves into the program and worked so hard, working in a
fishbowl environment on the booster,'' Davis said. ``There was a
very definite sense of relief and pride that our motors had
worked.''
   In the wake of the Challenger disaster, Morton Thiokol
redesigned its booster, the largest solid-fuel rocket ever built,
at a cost of $500 million. Most changes were aimed at improving the
critical joint seals.
   ``When you work on a program as long as we have, whenever a
space shuttle flies it does bring a tear to your eye,'' said Mike
Ayers, director of finance for space operations. ``Any space
shuttle launch is an emotional experience, especially for the
employees that worked so hard to put the shuttle back into flight.''
   Mel Rogers, who works on the booster's nozzles, said that if
something had gone wrong Thursday, ``I'd have had to move.''
   ``It felt good to hit something positive for once,'' Rogers
said. ``The things are hard enough to make, let alone be
criticized.''
   Thursday's launch was hailed by Brigham City Mayor Peter
Knudson. Most of Morton Thiokol's 8,000 Utah employees live in and
around his city.
   The mayor, a dentist, did not watch the launch because he was
with a patient. When informed by a reporter it was a success he
struggled to speak.
   ``That's fantastic. I'm near tears. It's a very emotional moment
for me. I've personally lived with this for so long. I just can't
tell you what this means to me,'' Knudson said.
   Wes Boman, Brigham City Chamber of Commerce director, said that
while the shuttle program was on hold, there was a sense of anxiety
in the town. Residents put off large purchases and the housing
market went at a slower pace, he said.
   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, who experienced a seven-day space flight
aboard Discovery in April 1985, attended Thursday's launch.
   ``It was hot down there in Florida, but I had goose bumps and
was crying,'' Garn said after returning to Washington. ``I really
would like to go up again...''

   Here are high points of the reforms Communist
Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev is seeking in the Soviet political
system and party apparatus, which party leaders and lawmakers will
reportedly consider this week:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   A STRONGER PRESIDENCY _ Apparently desiring a government post
tailored to his own talents, Gorbachev has called for giving the
Soviet president responsibility over defense and foreign policy and
power to name the prime minister. President Andrei A. Gromyko, now
head of state, holds an essentially ceremonial job.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   A MORE ACTIVE LEGISLATURE _ Gorbachev wants the 1,500-member
Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament, merged with a new
750-seat body representing artists, labor union members and other
social groups. That assembly would then elect a full-time
parliament of 400 or so members who would have real powers to pass
a state budget and other laws.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MULTICANDIDATE ELECTIONS _ The Soviet leader wants voters
nationwide for the first time to have a choice of candidates in
elections to the expanded Supreme Soviet by next March. It is
likely, however, that the Communist Party would keep its power of
veto over individual candidacies.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   A SLIMMED-DOWN PARTY _ Gorbachev wants the party's 20-million
membership roll reduced and its apparatus trimmed. Those goals are
in line with his often stated desire to more clearly delineate
party and government responsibilities.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   INDIRECT CONTROL ON PARTY BOSSES _ Gorbachev wants local party
chiefs to run for their local legislatures and be elected to be
their chairmen. If they fail to win either election because of a
lack of popular support, they could lose their party post as well.
   The party's Central Committee adopted broad goals for political
reform on July 29 after hearing Gorbachev outline his agenda. Those
decisions, however, were never made public, and could differ from
the reforms sought by Gorbachev.
   The Soviet leader has said changes are needed in the country's
political system to prevent any repeat of the bloody repression
carried out under Josef V. Stalin, or the corruption and stagnation
now seen as endemic under Leonid I. Brezhnev.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today issued a major
document on women that condemns discrimination, reaffirms a ban on
female priests and says women's personalities are formed
essentially by maternal characteristics.
   The 120-page document touches only briefly on the institutional
role of women in the Roman Catholic Church _ a controversial issue
in Western countries, particularly the United States.
   But it will likely have a significant effect, since it provides
the theoretical framework for decisions on women during the rest of
John Paul's papacy.
   ``Mulieris Dignitatem,'' Latin for ``On the Dignity of Women,''
is in the form of an apostolic letter, meaning that it is intended
as church teaching but is not considered infallible.
   In the introduction, the pope said he is responding to a call by
a bishops' synod last year for further theological and
anthropological study of what it means to be a man or woman.
   ``It is only by beginning from these bases ... that one is able
to speak of their (women's) active presence in the Church and in
society,'' he wrote.
   John Paul concluded that the sexes are equal but fundamentally
different, and that women are distinguished by such ``feminine''
characteristics as sensitivity to other people.
   He says women particularly fulfill their vocation through
motherhood _ either actual child-rearing or ``spiritual
motherhood,'' in which some women, such as nuns, remain celibate
and devote themselves to other people.
   Vatican officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
pope regarded the document as a ``very personal'' statement and
apparently did not consult outside experts on it.
   It came as the Vatican is facing increasing pressure from women
for a greater role in the church. The women's issue dominated the
1987 synod and has arisen recently with the ordination of a woman
bishop in the Episcopal Church in the United States, a move the
Vatican has described as a roadblock to Christian unity.
   In the document, the pope emphasizes repeatedly that men and
women are equal and sexual discrimination is a sin.
   ``The revealed truth concerning the creation of the human being
as male and female constitutes the principal argument against all
the objectively injurious and unjust situations which contain and
express the inheritance of the sin which all human beings bear
within themselves,'' he wrote.
   But he said that women's struggle for equality ``must not under
any condition lead to the `masculinization' of women.''
   ``The personal resources of femininity are certainly no less
than the resources of masculinity: they are merely different,'' he
said.
   The pope said men owe a special debt to women who bear their
children, and he denounced men who do not take responsibility for
their sexual acts.
   ``How often is she abandoned with her pregnancy, when the man,
the child's father, is unwilling to accept responsibility for it?''
the pope wrote.
   John Paul said women are more sensitive than men and receive a
special moral and spiritual strength from the ``awareness'' that
God has entrusted to them.
   However, he said the very difference between femininity and
masculinity means women should not be priests. Christ, he says,
only chose men to be his Apostles and to consecrate the Eucharist _
the ceremony that celebrates Christ's sacrifice of his life for the
church.
   ``Since Christ, in instituting the Eucharist, linked it in such
an explicit way to the priestly service of the Apostles, it is
legitimate to conclude that he thereby wished to express the
relationship between man and woman, between what is `feminine' and
what is `masculine,''' the document said.
   The pope rejected the argument that Jesus chose men as followers
because of sociological factors of his day, saying that Christ had
a highly unusual rapport with women that did not conform to custom.
   The document was more conservative in tone than a draft pastoral
letter released last spring by U.S. Roman Catholic bishops. The
draft recommended that women play more of a leadership role in the
church and suggested that the church be more responsive toward the
many Catholic women who practice artificial birth control.
   Vatican officials conceded that some women would be disappointed
in the new document.
   ``I think it will cause a lot of bitterness among women,
especially young women, who live in a culture where these arguments
have fallen apart and been seen for what they are,'' said Elisabeth
Schussler-Fiorenza, a scripture scholar at Harvard Divinity School.

   It was orbit 13 and just after 5:30
a.m. EDT when the call went up from Houston to space: ``Go-o-o-d
morning, Dis-cov-ery. G-o-o-d morning. Rise and shine. Time to
start doing that Shuttle Shuffle.''
   The taped voice belonged to actor Robin Williams, using the disc
jockey greeting he employed in the movie ``Good Morning Vietnam.''
   His exuberant call, which included a song from a Houston radio
station, was the method employed today by Mission Control in
Houston to wake up the space shuttle astronauts, who spent their
first night in orbit after being launched from Cape Canaveral
Thursday.
   ``Hey, here's a little song coming from the millions of us to
the five of you,'' said Williams, introducing the jangly theme
music from the television show ``Greenacres'' _ with modified
lyrics.
   ``Oh, orbit is the place to be, free wheeling on Discovery.
   ``Earth roaming by so far below, just give it the gas and watch
this baby go.
   ``We can't believe we made it here, so high above the atmosphere.
   ``We just adore the scenery; Houston's great but give me that
Zero G.
   ``Hey, look out the window. That's me. Cap'n, I'm hungry.
   ``Maybe we'll land it _ right now?
   ``Uh, uh. Look ma, no hands. This is the life.
   ``Oh, what a sight. Earth orbit, we are here.''
   Discovery commander Frederick Hauck, using a hokey
country-western accent himself, then responded: ``G-o-o-d morning,
Houston. G-o-o-d morning, Houston. We thank ya for that nice
wake-up music.''
   Mission Control: ``Well, we thought you'd appreciate that.
   Hauck: ``Okay. Well thanks so much. Ya'll sure did good work not
wakin' us up in the evening.''
   The astronauts then set about doing some early morning chores,
reading the ``morning mail'' _ revised flight information _ and had
breakfast before beginning a full range of experiments aboard the
spacecraft.
   Mission Control said the wake-up tape was supplied to the space
agency by radio station KKBQ. One of the disc jockeys there, Mike
Cahill, put it together with Robin Williams, the mission
commentator said.

<HEAD>Chrysler To Repurchase Used ``Lemons''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Motors Corp. repurchased nearly 400
defective cars under the state's ``lemon law'' and then allowed
dealers to resell them without warning buyers of their past
problems, according to state Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   The company agreed to make up to $2 million in refunds in a
settlement with the state, Abrams said Thursday. He called the case
``one of the more flagrant violations of the law I've ever seen.''
   Chrysler and American Motors, a Chrysler subsidiary, repurchased
the cars from consumers who won arbitration cases against the
companies under the ``lemon law,'' Abrams said.
   That law defines a car as defective if a problem persists after
four repair attempts or if a car spends a total of 30 days in a
dealer's garage within 18 months of purchase.
   Abrams said the company turned around and resold the cars
without notifying the new buyers of their histories. He also said
Chrysler failed to notify the state Department of Motor Vehicles
that it had repurchased the ``lemons,'' as required by law. That
would have allowed the agency to issue new titles for the cars that
would have alerted used-car buyers of the problems.
   ``Consumers who buy cars are entitled to know of the car's lemon
history,'' said Abrams. ``Chrysler failed to provide this essential
information, which would have allowed consumers to make an
intelligent choice.''
   Chrysler, which admitted no wrongdoing in settling the case,
agreed to pay the state $100,000 in legal costs.
   Under the settlement, Chrysler will offer 205 consumers who
purchased defective cars since last September the option of
returning the cars for a full refund or accepting a $1,000 cash
payment and a 12-month, 12,000-mile service contract.
   Customers who take the service contract option will be entitled
to free repair of any exisiting conditions and reimbursement for
previously documented repairs.
   An additional 185 consumers who purchased lemons between Aug. 2,
1986, and Aug. 31, 1987, will receive $750 cash awards plus the
service contract, free repairs and reimbursement for previous
repairs.
   Chrysler will mail notices to car owners by Oct. 8 and owners
will have 30 days to exercise their option.

   Firefighters battling an
arson-set blaze that has burned more than 10,000 acres of mountain
brush and destroyed two homes got a break today as hot, dry winds
died down.
   ``Things are looking pretty good,'' California Department of
Forestry spokeswoman Kathy Reiboldt said early today as winds
calmed to 5 mph from as high as 60 mph Thursday.
   But she cautioned, ``If the winds come up again, we could be in
trouble.''
   Elsewhere, the forecast called for little wind and warm, dry
weather at Yellowstone National Park, and officials said more snow
will be needed to extinguish the three fires still burning there.
   ``Containment is dependent upon weather conditions at this
point,'' park spokeswoman Sandi Robinson said Thursday.
   The number of firefighters in the park has dropped to 1,841 from
a peak of more than 9,600 on Sept. 5, and Robinson said the number
will continue to drop gradually.
   The 10,660-acre Texas fire in the San Gabriel Mountains about 55
miles east of downtown Los Angeles was 60 percent contained early
today, Ms. Reiboldt said. She would not make any prediction on when
the fire would be extinguished.
   More than 1,000 firefighters aided by 10 air tankers and
helicopters were battling the blaze, one of 30 arson-caused fires
in the area in recent months.
   Three people were injured including two prison inmates on a
firefighting crew who suffered minor burns. A resident also was
treated for smoke inhalation Wednesday, Ms. Reiboldt said.
   The fire destroyed two homes and some chicken coops Thursday,
and winds ripping through mountain canyons pushed the flames toward
1,800 homes near the town of Etiwanda and within 100 yards of
evacuated Summit Elementary School. The school remained closed
today but about 150 residents who were forced to evacuate Thursday
morning were allowed to return to their homes in the afternoon,
state Department of Forestry spokeswoman Mary Grisamore said.
   A 670-acre fire in Glen Helen that had been started by
firefighters to destroy overgrown brush was contained at 6 p.m.
Thursday. The fire had roared out of control when the winds picked
up.

<HEAD>Excerpts of Papal Letter on Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following are excerpts of ``Mulieris
Dignitatem,'' Latin for ``On the Dignity of Women,'' an apostolic
letter issued Friday by Pope John Paul II. They are taken from the
official English-language text.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   This concise passage (from Genesis) contains the fundamental
anthropological truths: Man is the high point of the whole order of
creation in the visible world; the human race, which takes its
origin from the calling into existence of man and woman, crowns the
whole work of creation; both man and woman are human beings to an
equal degree, both are created in God's image.
   The woman cannot become the ``object' of ``domination'' and male
``possession.''
   The revealed truth concerning the creation of the human being as
male and female constitutes the principal argument against all the
objectively injurious and unjust situations which contain and
express the inheritance of the sin which all human beings bear
within themselves.
   In the name of liberation from male ``domination,'' women must
not appropriate to themselves male characteristics contrary to
their own feminine ``originality.'' There is a well-founded fear
that if they take this path, women will not ``reach fulfillment,''
but instead will deform and lose what constitutes their essential
richness.
   The personal resources of femininity are certainly no less than
the resources of masculinity; they are merely different. Hence, a
woman, as well as a man, must understand her ``fulfillment'' as a
person, her dignity and vocation, on the basis of these resources,
according to the richness of the femininity which she received on
the day of creation and which she inherits as an expression of the
``image and likeness of God'' that is specifically hers.
   Jesus enters into the concrete and historical situation of
women, a situation which is weighed down by the inheritance of sin.
One of the ways in which this inheritance is expressed is habitual
discrimination against women in favor of men.
   How often ... the woman pays for her own sin (maybe it is she,
in some cases, who is guilty of the ``other's sin'' _ the sin of
the man) but she alone pays and she pays all alone! How often is
she abandoned with her pregnancy, when the man, the child's father,
is unwilling to accept responsibility for it? And besides the many
``unwed mothers'' in our society, we also must consider all those
who, as a result of various pressures, even on the part of the
guilty man, very often ``get rid of'' the child before it is born.
   Motherhood implies from the beginning a special openness to the
new person: and this is precisely the woman's ``part.'' In this
openness, in conceiving and giving birth to a child, the woman
``discovers herself through a sincere gift of self.''
   It is the woman who ``pays'' directly for this shared generation
(of a child), which literally absorbs the energies of her body and
soul. It is therefore necessary that the man be fully aware that in
their shared parenthood he owes a special debt to the woman. No
program of ``equal rights'' between women and men is valid unless
it takes this fact fully into account.
   This unique contact (of a mother) with the new human being
developing within her gives rise to an attitude towards human
beings _ not only toward her own child, but every human being _
which profoundly marks the woman's personality. It is commonly
thought that women are more capable than men of paying attention to
another person and that motherhood develops this predisposition
even more.
   The Gospel puts forward the ideal of the consecration of the
person, that is, the person's exclusive dedication to God by virtue
of the evangelical counsels: in particular, chastity, poverty and
obedience .... In this wider context, virginity has to be
considered also as a path for women, a path on which they realize
their womanhood in a way different from marriage.
   In calling only men as his Apostles, Christ acted in a
completely free and sovereign manner. In doing so, he exercised the
same freedom with which, in all his behavior, he emphasized the
dignity and the vocation of women, without conforming to the
prevailing customs and to the traditions sanctioned by the
legislation of the time. Consequently, the assumption that he
called men to be apostles in order to conform with the widespread
mentality of his times does not at all correspond to Christ's way
of acting.
   Since Christ, in instituting the Eucharist, linked it in such an
explicit way to the priestly service of the Apostles, it is
legitimate to conclude that he thereby wished to express the
relationship between man and woman, between what is ``feminine''
and what is ``masculine.''
   It is the Eucharist above all that expresses the redemptive act
of Christ the Bridegroom toward the Church the Bride. This is clear
and unambiguous when the sacramental ministry of the Eucharist, in
which the priest acts ``in persona Christi,'' is performed by a man.
   When the author of the Letter to the Ephesians calls Christ
``the Bridegroom'' and the Church ``the Bride,'' he indirectly
confirms through this analogy the truth about woman as bride. The
Bridegroom is the one who loves. The Bride is loved; it is she who
receives love, in order to love in return.
   The moral and spiritual strength of a woman is joined to her
awareness that God entrusts the human being to her in a special way
.... A woman is strong because of her awareness of this entrusting
.... This awareness and this fundamental vocation speak to women of
the dignity which they receive from God himself, and this makes
them ``strong'' and strengthens their vocation. Thus the ``perfect
woman'' becomes an irreplaceable support and source of spiritual
strength for other people.
   In our own time, the successes of science and technology make it
possible to attain material well-being to a degree hitherto
unknown. While this favors some, it pushes others to the edges of
society. In this way, unilateral progress can also lead to a
gradual loss of sensitivity for man .... In this sense our time in
particular awaits the manifestation of that ``genius'' which
belongs to women, and which can ensure sensitivity for human beings
in every circumstance.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain has postponed a three-day visit to Poland at the request of
Polish authorities, who are forming a new government, a government
spokesman said today.
   Parliament named Mieczyslaw Rakowski as prime minister on
Tuesday. Rakowski immediately asked for two weeks to form a new
government to be presented for approval to the parliament on Oct.
13 and 14.
   Thatcher was scheduled to visit Poland from Oct. 16 to 18.
   ``The Polish authorities asked the British side to postpone the
date because of the reconstruction of the government,'' said
assistant government spokesman Ryszard Strauss.
   No new dates have been announced, but the spokesman said the
visit would still take place.
   ``I don't think it is going to be that far away. It is just a
question of fitting the schedule of both sides,'' he said.
   On the final day of her visit, Thatcher planned to travel to
Gdansk, the birthplace of the banned Solidarity trade union
movement. She was scheduled to set a wreathe with Polish leader
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski at a monument commemorating the outbreak
of World War II.
   Later she was to meet with Soldarity leader Lech Walesa before
returning to London.
   The state-controlled press did not directly attack the planned
meeting with Walesa, but it printed letters from the British press
criticizing the meeting as well as calls from Labor Party officials
urging her not to meet Walesa.

   The father of one of five victims of a house fire
was arrested as he tried to reach an ambulance where his dying
2-year-old daughter was being treated, police and witnesses say.
   Dallas police said Thursday they wrestled Homer Hutchins to the
ground and placed him in a neck restraining hold after he illegally
parked his truck and tried to break away from two officers to reach
his daughter.
   Hutchins, 19, was arrested because ``he had refused to calm
himself'' and ``fought them violently'' as he tried to reach his
daughter, Jasmas Jordan, according to the arrest report. He was
charged with obstructing a police roadway.
   ``They had him in handcuffs while his daughter was dying. That
has to hurt,'' said Hutchins' brother, Jimmie Hutchins. ``You think
he won't carry that with him every day for the rest of his life?''
   Also killed in the fire were the girl's mother; a sister of the
mother; and a brother and sister of Hutchins.
   Investigators said Thursday that arson was the cause of the fire
and said they were looking into reports that the blaze might have
been set as an act of revenge against one of the victims.
   An internal investigation also has been ordered by Police Chief
Mack Vines to determine whether departmental procedure was violated
by officers who prevented Hutchins from reaching his daughter.
   Southeast Patrol Division Sgt. Steve Umlor would not comment on
the arrest but said in general, a police officer's role at a fire
is to make sure civilians do not interfere with firefighters or run
into burning buildings.
   The father told the Dallas Times Herald he arrived at the
burning house about 5 a.m., parked his truck in the street and was
running toward the house when he was grabbed by two officers who
told him to move his truck.
   ``I said, `My daughter's in there,''' Hutchins said. ``They said
I still had to move my truck.''
   When officers refused to let Hutchins beyond the police line, he
tried to run between them, but they wrestled him to the ground, he
said. He was arrested and released 30 minutes later.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli newspaper reported today that eight
Americans and one Briton held hostage in Lebanon will be freed in
October as a result of secret talks between the United States and
Iran.
   In exchange for the release, Washington will provide economic
aid, gradually release billions of dollars in Iranian funds frozen
in U.S. banks and resume diplomatic relations with Tehran, the
English-language weekly The Nation said in a report from Geneva.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
denied the report. ``There have been no such meetings. The story is
not true. It is all false,'' she said.
   The Nation said in its unattributed report that the secret
negotiations between Tehran and Washington began in Geneva on
Monday. The newspaper began publishing four weeks ago so it was
difficult to judge the report's credibility.
   The Iranian delegation told U.S. representatives that the
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems holding the hostages in Lebanon demanded
$3 million in ransom and immunity from prosecution, The Nation
said. The captors appear to have dropped their demand for the
release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists held in Kuwait, the newspaper
said.
   The American delegates responded that they were not in a
position to pay ransom, the report said.
   Under an agreement worked out in Geneva, five American hostages
will be released around Oct. 7, and the second group of three
Americans and an Englishman is to be freed a week later, the report
said.
   Nine Americans are held hostage in Lebanon. The Iranians told
the American delegates they did not know the whereabouts of one of
the hostages _ U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, The Nation
said. Higgins, 41, was a U.N. peacekeeper kidnapped Feb. 17.
   The Iranians said they knew only that Higgins was spirited
aboard a fishing boat off Tyre and carried to a larger vessel
waiting at sea, the newspaper said.
   The British hostage is thought to be Anglican Church envoy Terry
Waite, who disappeared in Lebanon last year, The Nation said.
   In all, 17 foreign hostages are believed held in Lebanon. Terry
Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, is the longest held hostage. Anderson, an American, was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   ``This round of talks lasted 4{ days,'' Giora Shamis, the author
of the report, told The Associated Press. ``There will be more
talks on what's going to happen before the release'' of the
hostages.
   Asked about his sources, Shamis said he had been in Geneva
recently and that two of his reporters were there talking to the
Iranians and the Americans.
   Shamis said he owns the London-based news service Depth, which
sold the story to The Nation.
   Hesh Kestin, the newspaper's editor and managing editor, could
not immediately be reached for comment.
   In a related development, The Nation said Iran's
commander-in-chief, Hashemi Rafsanjani, narrowly escaped
assassination in Tehran on Sept. 23.
   Quoting unidentified sources, The Nation said assailants fired
automatic weapons on Rafsanjani's motorcade, killing four of his
bodyguards.

   Soviet missile experts completed
their inspection of a U.S. military base from which nuclear
missiles were recently removed and left West Germany today, the
U.S. Air Force said.
   It was the third Soviet group to inspect U.S. missile bases in
West Germany to verify compliance with the Intermediate Nuclear
Forces treaty. The treaty called for the scrapping of all
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   The 10-man team took off from Frankfurt's Rhein-Main Air Base,
Air Force spokesman Sgt. Larry Clavette told The Associated Press.
They had been in West Germany since Tuesday.
   The Soviet team performed what the superpower treaty terms
``short-notice inspections.''
   Both the Soviet Union and the United States have the right to
conduct 20 such inspections each year, giving 16 hours' notice.
   The Soviets inspected a U.S. military base at Heilbronn, near
Stuttgart, from which nine Pershing 2 missiles were removed on
Sept. 1.
   It was the first removal of nuclear missiles from West Germany
under the terms of the treaty.

<HEAD>Hospitalization Goes Down This Decade For Four Cancers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal study shows hospitalization rates for
four major types of cancer have fallen in the 1980s, but in some
cases more people suffer from the diseases.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
hospitalization rates for breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal
cancer and cervical cancer all have declined during the decade.
   The hospitalization rates, which were derived through
examination of patient discharge records, do not necessarily
reflect trends in the numbers of people with various cancers, said
Dr. James Mendlein, a CDC researcher. Some cancers may require more
follow-up visits than others, and the costs of health care also can
influence numbers of visits, he said.
   ``This gives you just one measure of the health care impact (of
various cancers),'' Mendlein said.
   The drop in hospitalization rates parallel a drop in incidence
rates for cervical cancer, colorectal cancer and male lung cancer,
Mendlein said. On the other hand, while hospitalizations for female
lung cancer and breast cancer are generally declining somewhat,
incidence of those two diseases continues to rise, he said.
   For 1986, the latest year for which estimates are available, the
CDC gave hospital discharge rates as:
   _Breast cancer, 172 per 100,000 people, down from a peak of 199
in 1983.
   _Lung cancer, male, 142 per 100,000, down from a peak of 182 in
1984.
   _Lung cancer, female, 83 per 100,000, down from a peak of 100 in
1983.
   _Colorectal cancer, 86 per 100,000, down from a peak of 92 in
1981.

   Sales of new, single-family homes in August
rose a slight 0.1 percent from the month before, pulled up by a
surge of sales in the Midwest, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said sales inched up to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 713,000 last month, following a 0.1 percent
dip in July. They had climbed a sharp 4.7 percent in June.
   Sales for all three summer months, taken together, were much
stronger than analysts had predicted at a time when mortgage
interest rates were rising. Economists attributed the brisk sales
pace to an attempt by home purchasers to buy before interest rates
went still higher.
   Interest on fixed-rate mortgages, which dipped below 10 percent
in February and March, has since climbed to about 10.5 percent, but
had been expected to rise more steeply.
   Analysts are still anticipating mortgage rates will increase to
11 percent by the start of next year, and continue up through the
first half of 1989.
   The median price of new homes fell 6.7 percent in August to
$112,000, meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less.
That followed an identical decline in July. However, the average
home price rose 2.0 percent to $145,200 in August following a 4.2
percent rise in July.
   The combination of a drop in the median price and rise in the
average price likely means more new homes of very high prices are
being sold, skewing the average. Contractors, squeezed by high land
prices, are apparently attempting to sell to affluent purchasers
looking to trade up, rather than to first-time home buyers.
   By region, sales rose 10.9 percent in the Midwest to an annual
sales pace of 102,000 units. They were up 1.9 percent in the
Northeast to 107,000 units and 0.3 percent to 287,000 units in the
South.
   A 5.2 percent drop in the West to 217,000 units almost offset
the gains in other regions.
   Economists say sales are recovering in the Midwest with the
export-driven resurgence of manufacturing firms. Sales have been
hurt on the East and West coasts by high land prices and a scarcity
of suitable building sites.
   For the first eight months of the year, new home sales were 1.4
percent lower than the same period a year earlier, less of a
dropoff than was anticipated at the beginning of the year.

<HEAD>Prominent Philippine Newspaper Publisher Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joaquin ``Chino'' Roces, a prominent
newspaper publisher who persuaded Corazon Aquino to run for
president, died today of complications from cancer, his doctor
announced. He was 75.
   The doctor, Cynthia Dominquez, said Roces was admitted to a
hospital Sept. 13 for treatment of a pulmonary infection.
   Roces, dean of the Philippine press corps, launched a campaign
in 1985 to solicit 1 million signatures on a petition asking Mrs.
Aquino to run against President Ferdinand Marcos in February 1986.
   Mrs. Aquino, the wife of slain opposition leader Benigno Aquino
Jr., at first rejected all suggestions that she run, saying she
knew nothing about being president. The signature drive changed her
mind, and Mrs. Aquino went on to claim victory in the election Feb.
7, 1986.
   Protests of massive fraud triggered the civilian-military
uprising that toppled the Marcos administration on Feb. 25, 1986
and forced him to flee to exile in Hawaii.
   Roces left journalism in 1972 when Marcos closed The Manila
Times, then the Philippines' largest newspaper, and other media
when he declared eight years of martial law.
   The Manila Times resumed publication after Mrs. Aquino took
office. Because of family differences, Roces first served as
publisher of The Manila Chronicle from 1986 until this year, when
he returned to The Manila Times.
   Roces came from one of Manila's oldest and wealthiest families.
   As publisher of The Manila Times, he was among an elite group
known as the ``kingmakers'' because of the influence they exerted
over officials and politicians.
   Roces gave Benigno Aquino his first job as a correspondent for
The Manila Times during the Korean War after the young Aquino
promised to pay his own fare to Korea.
   Despite failing health, the wiry chain-smoker led street
demonstrations against Marcos that were frequently broken up with
tear gas and club-carrying police.
   Roces remained a strong supporter of Mrs. Aquino. But last July,
he lectured the president about the alleged failure of her
administration to stamp out corruption and bring ``justice'' in the
wake of the Marcos era.
   Roces is survived by his wife, Pacita, and two sons, Joaquin
Jr., and Edgardo. His daughter, Rocio, died in a landslide in 1984.

   Premier Andreas Papandreou underwent
surgery today at a London hospital for replacement of a heart
valve, a government spokesman said.
   The spokesman, Sotiris Kostopoulos, said the 69-year-old premier
was ``optimistic and in good condition'' before entering the
operating room.
   The operation was performed at Harefield Hospital in north
London, where Papandreou has been undergoing treatment for a
narrowing of the aorta, the main vessel carrying blood from the
heart.
   In London, the press spokesman at the Greek Embassy who is
handling queries about the premier was not immediately available.
   Papandreou flew to London on August 25 after his heart condition
suddenly worsened. The operation couldn't be performed until a
liver disorder related to the heart problem was cleared up.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The departing head of the Star Wars research
program said today he decided to leave that job in order to be free
to come to the defense of the project.
   The retirement of Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson was announced
earlier this week by the Pentagon.
   Abrahamson said on ABC TV's ``Good Morning America'' that the
new administration to be elected in November _ whichever candidate
wins _ will undoubtedly want to re-assess many programs, including
the Strategic Defense Initiative, the formal name for Star Wars.
   ``When it's re-examined with a new administration, no matter
who, I believe that I'll be in the best position to explain the
progress of the program, the promise of the program, if people
think that I'm not fighting for my job,'' Abrahamson said.
   Asked the effect of suggestions by Democratic presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis that Star Wars spending should be cut to
$1 billion a year, about one-fourth of the current level,
Abrahamson responded:
   ``I think that would have a tragic result. It would
fundamentally erase the real progress that we've made.''
   ``The important thing is that he and other critics around the
country feel that research should go ahead,'' Abrahamson added.
   ``That's a fundamental reaffirmation. The fact that they may not
feel they need to put the amount of money into it is perhaps a lack
of understanding of the promise of the program and the progress.''
   As for Republican George Bush, Abrahamson said that ``the vice
president understands the program. He has been strongly committed,
he has given both his moral (support) and his support in the
government.''
   In the next administration, the program needs to be represented
well, he said, and ``I'd like to make that argument without people
thinking that I'm trying to enhance my own personal position.''
   Abrahamson, who took command of the Star Wars program in 1984,
will be succeeded by Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan Jr.

   An airline will no longer allow unclaimed luggage
to be used by police to train bomb-sniffing dogs after a stick of
powerful explosives was inadvertently left in a couple's suitcase.
   Police, who say the stick of ammonium nitrate gel could not have
exploded without a blasting cap, have apologized to Gregorio and
Esther Martinez of Miami.
   ``We admit our mistake and apologize to the family for the
inconvenience and scare they had,'' said Detective Al Hidalgo-Gato,
a Metro-Dade spokesman. ``For all they knew, they had a real bomb.
... This had never happened before.''
   Eastern Airlines officials tracked down the couple after they
found their suitcase, which had been left behind at Miami
International Airport earlier this month.
   Mrs. Martinez discovered the explosive when she opened the
suitcase at home.
   If exploded, the bomb was powerful enough to have blown up the
couple's home and damaged two homes nearby, police said.
   Eastern Airlines spokesman Robin Matell said the carrier will
continue to cooperate with the training exercises, but will no
longer provide lost luggage. Instead, the airline will use dummy
suitcases for the tests.
   During a training session Tuesday, officers apparently failed to
retrieve the explosive when they cleared the area, Matell said.
   ``The luggage was used with the understanding it had been
unclaimed for some time,'' said police spokeswoman Lucy Fitts.
   The explosive was slightly larger than a highway flare and
marked ``High Explosives.''
   ``I was scared,'' Mrs. Martinez said. She gingerly placed the
device on her dresser, then waited for her husband to come home.
   ``I said, `Look what I found,''' Mrs. Martinez said.
   ``That's a bomb!'' her husband cried, snatching the device from
the dresser and taking it out to the back yard before calling
police.
   Metro-Dade officials will review training procedures in the wake
of the incident, Matell added.
   The K-9 unit's weekly training exercises are required by the
Federal Aviation Administration.

<HEAD>`Second Wave' of AIDS Infection May Hit Gay Community, Official
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Because AIDS is more easily spread the
longer a person is infected with the disease, a ``second wave'' of
AIDS infection may hit the homosexual population, a public health
official warns.
   Participants at the three-day Second National AIDS Conference
were also told Thursday that AIDS prevention and education programs
aimed at minority groups will have to come from within the minority
community to be effective.
   Efforts to stop transmission among the gay community need to be
intensified, said George Rutherford, medical director of the AIDS
office in the San Francisco Public Health Department.
   AIDS is more easily spread the longer a person has been infected
with the virus, he said. Because the disease has been present in
the San Francisco gay community for almost eight years, the number
of victims in the terminal phase of the disease is increasing.
   ``The risk to gay men per episode of intercourse may be
increasing,'' said Rutherford, adding that failure to practice safe
sex may represent a ``substantially greater risk'' as the
population ages.
   ``This is no time to have a 10 percent failure rate,'' he
emphasized.
   More than 1,200 people attended the first day of the conference,
which is designed to provide local public health officials and
community health advocates with an exchange of information on how
best to fight the epidemic.
   Minority communities lack the financial resources and volunteer
time that have marked the gay community's response to the crisis,
Patricia Evans, branch chief of education and prevention in the
AIDS Office of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, said
at the conference.
   One-third of blacks live in poverty, she said, adding that it's
``very difficult for those individuals to volunteer when they are
trying to take care of the basic necessities of life.''
   To be successful, AIDS prevention and education programs aimed
at minority groups will have to ``come from within that
community,'' Evans said.
   The Centers for Disease Control reported this week that 74,447
cases of AIDS have been diagnosed since 1981. A total of 41,925
people had died of the disease.
   Rutherford said a total of 365,000 AIDS cases are expected by
the end of 1992. More than 263,000 people will have died by then,
he said.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a generally
deadly virus that devastates the body's immune system, leaving
sufferers susceptible to infections and cancer. Gay men and
intravenous drug users have been the primary victims of the
epidemic.

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ NASA, criticized in the Challenger
investigation for routinely granting waivers to its own safety
guidelines, bent its standards again to launch Discovery into
lighter-than-expected winds.
   ``The team threaded the needle without violating any rules,
without backing off any of our safety criteria,'' NASA shuttle
director Richard Truly said on ABC today.
   ``The winds did not violate our safety factor,'' said Thomas
Utsman, deputy director of the Kennedy Space Center. But he
confirmed that launching in those conditions did require a waiver
of launch rules.
   ``It wasn't taken lightly,'' he said. ``It was not a result of a
judgment, but a refined engineering analysis.''
   Truly said he wasn't completely confident of a Thursday launch.
   ``I wasn't at all sure we were going to lift off until we got to
T-minus-zero (the end of the countdown,'' he said. ``You know, even
coming out of the nine-minute hold there are thousands of parts of
the hardware and software to check and the engines as they come up
to speed. So, until we lit those solids (the booster rockets), I
wasn't confident that we were going to go.''
   The wind waiver was considered and approved by Truly and a new
launch oversight team headed by another veteran astronaut, Rober9-30 0213

   Student leaders say police broke up
demonstrations at two universities by firing tear gas and beating
up demonstrators. The students were protesting alleged high-level
corruption in the government.
   By today, police had freed most of the 478 students arrested in
the protests Thursday at the University of Zimbabwe and the Harare
Polytechnic.
   Witnesses said students began hurling stones at police when they
were barred from leaving the two campuses to carry their protests
through the streets of dowtown Harare.
   Student leaders told The Associated Press the paramilitary units
fired tear gas and rubber bullets and beat others with batons. They
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hospital officials reported surgical teams worked late Thursday
night treating injured students, mainly for cuts and bruises.
   Several thousand students began demonstrating early Thursday at
the two institutions to protest alleged corruption among cabinet
ministers, leaders of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union
(Patriotic Front) and bureaucrats.
   They marched with banners saying ``National Looters Must Go''
and ``Weed Out Political Thieves.''
   President Robert Mugabe was visiting Britain at the time.
   In previous demonstrations against South Africa's racial
policies students have set fire to cars, smashed office windows and
beaten up shoppers and workers.

   About 700 people paid their last respects at the
funeral of a Vietnam veteran who was shot to death by a policeman
after killing another officer and three other people near a school.
   ``He wasn't as messed up as people thought,'' said a niece of
the slain gunman, Clem Henderson, 40.
   ``The media didn't really get to the true Clem,'' said the
niece, Brenda Robinson, 29. ``He was always supportive to family.
He was active in painting (church murals), and he was active in the
community.''
   A folded American flag lay next to the body of Henderson.
   Henderson had a history of strange behavior and arrests before
the Sept. 23 shooting spree, which began at an auto parts store.
   The store's manager and an employee were killed, along with a
custodian at the nearby Montefiore School for troubled boys, before
Henderson encountered two police officers at the school's door.
Officer Irma Ruiz was killed before her partner, Gregory Jaglowski,
shot and killed Henderson in an exchange of gunfire. Jaglowski was
wounded in the legs.
   At Mrs. Ruiz's funeral Monday, the Rev. James Maloney told
mourners that anger over the killings perhaps should be directed
``at those who are cutting and continue to cut resources for our
mentally ill.
   ``Perhaps that is what killed Irma, because there was a person
(Henderson) who needed more help, more love and more understanding
than our institutions provided him,'' Maloney said.
   Ms. Robinson said her uncle was basically a good man.
   ``He just kept trying to get out of the ghetto,'' she said,
``but he just kept winding up there again and again.''
   The service at the House of Branch funeral home was attended by
about 700 people, said funeral director L.C. Branch. Burial was
scheduled for today.

   The move could clear the way for Mikhail S. Gorbachev to seek
election to a new, more powerful presidency.
   Vadim A. Medvedev, a spokesman for the Communist Party Central
Committee, said Mikhail S. Solomentsev, 75, also had been retired
from his positions as a full member of the Politburo and head of
the Party Control Commission.
   The move came on the first day of a hastily called meeting of
the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee to discuss
reorganization of the party structure in line with Gorbachev's
reforms.
   Tass said earlier that the session would consider ``proposals on
reorganization of the party apparatus in the light of the decisions
of the 19th Communist Party conference.''
   At that congress in June, the Soviet leader outlined a series of
political reforms. His blueprint calls for the creation of a
full-time, standing legislature and a more powerful presidency.

   A former state senator who staged his own
death and led authorities on a two-year, worldwide manhunt has
pleaded guilty in a plot to defraud a union pension fund of $20
million.
   David Friedland, 50, entered the plea to a racketeering count
Thursday before Chief U.S. District Judge John F. Gerry.
   ``He has often portrayed himself as a glamorous figure,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff. ``The truth is, there was
nothing glamorous about him or the crime. This was one of the
grubbiest kinds of crime.''
   The former Jersey City legislator was accused of masterminding a
plot to defraud the pension fund of North Brunswick Teamsters Local
701.
   ``We're very satisfied that justice was done and he admitted to
engaging in racketeering,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney J Imbert.
   In return for the guilty plea, Imbert said the government will
drop remaining charges, including perjury, mail and wire fraud,
against Friedland when he is sentenced Oct. 28.
   Friedland faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.
   He had faced up to 150 years in jail if he had been convicted of
all the original charges.
   ``I think that was a a very good disposition for the government
and for David,'' said John Yacovelle, one of Friedland's attorneys.
``I think he's relieved to get it behind him.''
   Federal authorities say Friedland staged a fake drowning in the
Bahamas on Labor Day 1985, just before he was indicted along with
three co-defendants _ two union pension fund trustees and the
fund's lawyer. He was arrested last December in the Maldive Islands
in the Indian Ocean.
   Chertoff called the outcome a ``total victory.''
   ``The court and the jury has been spared a significant amount of
time,'' he said.
   The plea agreement came after the testimony Thursday of the
former manager of the pension fund and Joseph J. Higgins,
Friedland's partner in Omni Funding of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which
managed the investments skimmed from the pension fund.
   ``In part, as he was confronted with what was unquestionable
evidence of his guilt, I think he was motivated by personal
embarrassment _ if nothing else _ to plead and put an end to the
proceedings,'' Chertoff said. ``A chapter is over in David
Friedland's life.''

   The mother of a 26-year-old woman who accuses
Sen. Brock Adams of sexual assault says Adams earlier made a pass
at her, while newly released police records in the daughter's case
show no medical evidence of sexual activity or drugs.
   Sylvia Tupper, mother of Kari Tupper who has accused Adams,
D-Wash., of drugging and then sexually assaulting her during an
overnight stay in his Washington home, said Adams propositioned her
in 1986, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported today.
   The incident occurred during a period when she had lunch with
him several times with her husband's knowledge, the newspaper
quoted Mrs. Tupper as saying. Adams and Mrs. Tupper have been
friends since they both were in student government at the
University of Washington 40 years ago.
   Kari Tupper's sister, Kathie Buckham of Seattle, said Thursday
night that Tupper first told her Adams had made a sexual advance
toward her after a 1985 fund-raiser.
   On the night in question, March 27, 1987, Ms. Tupper said she
had accepted an invitation to go to a restaurant with Adams after
she plotted a strategy to tell the senator to stop propositioning
her.
   ``I knew the dinner was going to take place ... the motives
behind it,'' Mrs. Buckham said. ``We rehearsed it, how she was
going to say it.''
   Adams has denied he made any sexual advances toward Ms. Tupper
and said she came to his house to discuss her search for a job in
Washington. He contends Tupper tried to blackmail him for $400,000.
   But Adams said he made a mistake by letting Tupper, a longtime
family friend, spend the night at his house when his wife was out
of town.
   Adams issued a statement to reporters about the episode on
Tuesday. He did not accept questions and has refused further
comment.
   Police records released Thursday in response to a Freedom of
Information Act request were compiled as part of the District of
Columbia police department's investigation into Kari Tupper's
allegations against Adams.
   They also indicate that prosecutors declined to charge Adams in
part because ``there were problems with the victim's credibility.''
   The record also shows there were apparently questions raised
about ``medical and physical corroboration.''
   The police file contains a detective's interview with Tupper and
others, reports from two hospitals and a statement reflecting the
decision of the U.S. attorney's office.
   Much of the file is blacked out to protect the witnesses'
privacy.
   Tupper, a former secretary on Capitol Hill, made a complaint
against Adams in July 1987, nearly four months after she claimed
that Adams put a drug in her drink, took her to bed and fondled her
on the night of March 27, 1987, and the next morning.
   That morning Tupper went to the Arlington Hospital in suburban
Virginia for tests. Those tests proved negative for sperm or an
enzyme found in semen, the record shows. A urine-analysis
drug-screening test found only traces of anti-inflammatory drugs.
   Three days later Tupper admitted herself for an examination by
doctors at George Washington University Medical Center, claiming
she had been sexually assaulted. A test for semen was not performed.
   Joseph DiGenova, the U.S. attorney at the time, said in an
interview that the case was handled in a routine fashion by
prosecutors who determined it had ``absolutely no merit whatsoever
_ zero, zip _ it was nothing.''
   Tupper, who is now married, has been unavailable for comment
since the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported the story early in
the week. But her father, Dr. James Tupper, said his family feels
betrayed by Adams.
   ``Kari trusted and respected this man,'' the woman's father said
on Wednesday. ``She never believed he would try to hurt or take
advantage of her.''
   Tupper claimed in her interview with Detective Patrick Shine
that Adams had made sexual advances towards her nearly two years
before March 27, 1987. On that night, she wanted to get together
with Adams to ask him to stop ``harassing me and making me feel
uncomfortable at receptions,'' the police report said.
   Adams has said Tupper wanted to talk about her employment.
   Adams and Tupper were supposed to meet at a restaurant, but
Adams did not show up because her office had told him she was ill
that day. When Tupper called his house, Adams invited her over,
Tupper said.
   After three drinks, Tupper said she went to the bathroom feeling
nauseated. That was the last thing she recalled, she said.
   ``The next thing that I know for sure happened was that I woke
up in the morning between 6 and 6:30. ... I did not have my clothes
on. ... He was laying down on my side and he was laying behind
me,'' she said.
   ``I remember him touching my bare breast and buttocks and I
tried to sit up and he was pulling me back down into the bed with
him,'' she said. ``He was turning me over to face him and he was
kissing me on the lips. He was continuing to touch me. I was
crying,'' she said.
   After leaving Adams' house, Tupper said, she had trouble driving
home. She later went to the airport to meet friends who took her to
the hospital for the tests.

<HEAD>Producers Can Argue Porn Actress Used Fake Birth Certificate,
Court Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two film producers charged with child
pornography can argue that a 16-year-old actress used a phony birth
certificate and other papers that said she was over 18, an appeals
court has ruled.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 Thursday to
reject a government appeal that the producers of ``Those Young
Girls,'' starring actress Traci Lords, not be allowed to use a
``mistake defense'' when they go to trial.
   The producers have argued they didn't know Lords was only 16
when they filmed the movie.
   Beverly Hills attorney John Weston, who represents the
producers, called the ruling a ``very important opinion and very
important result'' reflecting constitutional guarantees of freedom
of speech and due process.
   The government went to the 9th Circuit after a U.S. district
judge in Los Angeles refused in a pretrial hearing to dismiss the
charge or strike down the law, but ruled that the producers could
be acquitted if they could prove they reasonably believed Lords was
an adult.
   Producers Ronald Kantor and Rupert Macnee, along with talent
agent James Souter Jr., were charged with violating a federal law
against production of materials that show a juvenile in sexually
explicit conduct. The crime carries a penalty of up to 10 years in
prison and a $100,000 fine.
   Souter pleaded guilty but his attorney said he planned to
withdraw his plea if Kantor and Macnee got a favorable ruling.
   Attorneys for the defendants have said Lords showed them a
genuine-looking birth certificate and state identification card
that indicated she was over 18. They also said they relied on
Lords' sophisticated appearance and demeanor.
   The two-judge majority said the First Amendment is as close to
an absolute as exists in United States jurisprudence and ``distaste
we may feel as individuals toward the content or message of
protected expression'' shouldn't sway the courts.
   The decision, written by Judge Alex Kozinski, cited a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling striking down an ordinance imposing criminal
penalties on a bookseller for possession of an obscene book, saying
knowledge of the alleged obscenity was required. Not allowing a
reasonable mistake of age defense, the 9th Circuit said, would
result in a chilling effect on free speech.
   Lords, an Ohio runaway, has appeared in more than 100 adult
videos and films.

   A Piper aircraft carrying Spanish travel agents
from the Dominican Republic to Havana smashed into a mountain in
southeastern Cuba, killing all six people aboard, Havana Radio
reported today.
   The wreckage from Thursday night's crash was found in a heavily
wooded area near the city of Santiago de Cuba, hampering recovery
of the bodies, according to the report monitored in Miami.
   The passengers were identified as Carlos San Basilio, president
of Iberia Transmediterranean Co.; his wife Carmen, and company
executives Guillermo Garcia Velasco, Javier Isogrudo Alsona and
Carmen Vidal.
   The pilot was identified as Eli Rodriquez of the Dominican
Republic.
   The Spanish ambassador flew from Havana to inspect the crash
scene, the report said.
   The small aircraft had refueled at Santiago de Cuba and had
taken off to fly on to Havana when the pilot asked permission for
an emergency landing, the broadcast said. It did not give a cause
for the accident, but said the terrain around the airport might
have contributed to the crash.
   ``The Santiago de Cuba airport is considered one of the most
difficult to reach because it is encircled by mountains,'' said the
broadcast.

   Government forces killed at least 76
people in suppressing unrest this week and today recaptured Chinese
border outposts overrun by communist rebels who back the protests,
a government spokesman said.
   Also today, a representative of rebels of the Karen ethnic
minority said nearly 2,000 students and others have fled to areas
under their control along the Thai-Burmese border. The
anti-government refugees hope to receive military training at Karen
bases.
   Kyaw Sann, a spokesman for the military government, said from
Tuesday to Thursday that 76 people were killed as the government
put down unrest. He said 24 others were wounded and 269 were
arrested.
   By official count, at least 425 people have been killed since
hardline Gen. Saw Maung seized power Sept. 18 and ordered troops to
quell pro-democracy demonstrations throughout the country. The
government says some of those killed were looters.
   The new government has promised multiparty general elections.
But opposition leaders have urged people to continue a general
strike begun Aug. 8 and fight the government through other peaceful
means.
   Anti-government unrest has swelled this year against
military-backed one-party rule. The latest wave began in July when
it forced Ne Win from power after 26 years.
   Kyaw Sann also told a news conference that three army outposts
that fell to rebels of the outlawed Burma Communist Party were
recaptured today with support from air strikes.
   One week ago, more than 1,500 insurgents attacked and occupied
positions at Lamingone, Yanshingone and Payagone near the Chinese
border about 340 miles northeast of Rangoon. Clashes in the area
killed at least 131 rebels with 48 government troops dead and
another 104 wounded, the government spokesman said.
   Kyaw Sann said government troops were still carrying out
mopping-up operations against the rebels, who have an estimated
total of 20,000 fighters.
   The Burma Communist Party earlier issued a statement supporting
the popular pro-democracy uprising. But it was not clear if the
reported attacks were designed to take pressure off the protesters.
   Asked about arrests of students, who spearheaded the protests,
Kyaw Sann said 86 remained in custody. Some students who fled to
Karen outposts said they saw authorities execute protesters.
   The Karen are among a dozen ethnic groups fighting for greater
autonomy from the central government. The Karens, who number about
2 million people, first rose up against Rangoon in the late 1940s.
   The state radio said Thursday that about 800 students have
``landed on the wrong path'' and fled to areas controlled by Karen
as well as other insurgents.
   Official media, meanwhile, said conditions were returning to
normal after the weeks of unrest that crippled the already weak
economy.
   The United Nations Children's Fund today began a six-day airlift
with 103 tons of emergency medical supplies for hospitals in Burma.
   The government said regular passenger service between Rangoon to
the country's second largest city, Mandalay, would resume Sunday.
Both local and international air service by Burma's government
airline were to resume Saturday.

<HEAD>Former Developer John Kroh Found Guilty of Bank Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former millionaire real estate
developer, described by his lawyer as a ``man of the highest
integrity,'' has been found guilty of defrauding banks to keep his
failing company afloat.
   John A. Kroh Jr., 47, remained impassive as the jury delivered
the verdict Thursday after five hours of deliberations. He would
not comment afterward.
   Kroh's corporation, Kroh Brothers Development Co., was one of
Kansas City's most successful development companies, responsible
for nearly 170 shopping centers, residential areas and office
buildings in 13 states. In early 1986 the company was valued at
nearly $70 million, but it went into bankruptcy in February 1987.
Kroh also declared personal bankruptcy.
   Kroh was found guilty of 13 counts of conspiracy, bank fraud,
wire fraud, receiving stolen money and forging his wife's name on
loan application papers.
   U.S. District Judge John Whipple said he would set a sentencing
date within 30 days, after receiving a pre-sentence report. Kroh's
lawyers said they would decide by then whether to appeal.
   Kroh could receive a maximum sentence of more than 80 years in
prison and a $3.25 million fine.
   His lead attorney, Darrell McGowen of Chicago, said Kroh was ``a
decent, caring human being.''
   ``Whether he may stand at this particular moment guilty, there
is a difference between legal and moral guilt,'' McGowen said.
``And he is not morally guilty of the charges.''
   No family members were in the courtroom when the verdict was
read, including George P. Kroh, 50, who had testified against his
brother as part of an earlier plea bargain.
   George Kroh, a co-owner of the firm, served two months of a
three-year sentence this summer after pleading guilty to fraud and
conspiracy.
   The government charged that the development company started to
go downhill in 1986, under the weight of more than $750 million in
loans and investment financing arrangements that became complicated
by the 1986 tax changes.
   Prosecutors said John Kroh falsified financial statements to
banks in late 1986 in order to obtain personal loans.
   Kroh maintained he never tried to deceive the banks. He said he
had delegated responsibility for filling out the financial
statements to employees.

<HEAD>Increase in Pneumonia Deaths Attributed to AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS, the deadly disease that allows other
infections to ravage the body, is believed responsible for an
increase in pneumonia deaths among young adults in New York and
possibly other cities.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
the mortality rate for men 25-44 from pneumonia increased in New
York from four deaths per 100,000 people in 1978, before the advent
of AIDS, to 19 per 100,000 in 1987.
   For women, the rate increased from two per 100,000 in 1978 to
seven in 1987. Actual fatality counts were not included in the CDC
report.
   ``Most pneumonia-attributable deaths occur among the elderly,''
the CDC said in its weekly report. ``In New York City, however, the
number and rate of such deaths among younger persons have increased
in association with (AIDS) infections in intravenous drug abusers.''
   The records of 192 New Yorkers ages 25-44 who died with
pneumonia in 1986 showed that 153, or 80 percent, were at high risk
for AIDS, including 126 intravenous drug abusers. Fifty had
possible symptoms of AIDS, and 26 were diagnosed as having AIDS.
   ``Similar trends may be occurring in other cities,'' the CDC
said.
   According to data from 121 large U.S. cities surveyed, the
percentages of deaths attributable to pneumonia and influenza in
persons 25-44 _ the group most affected by AIDS _ increased
beginning in 1981 in cities with the highest prevalence of AIDS,
the Atlanta-based health agency said.
   CDC researchers said the number and percentage of pneumonia@flu
deaths in people 25-44 have more than doubled in the cities in the
top 10 percent for rate of AIDS cases: San Francisco; Miami; Jersey
City, N.J.; New York; Newark, N.J.; Washington; Paterson, N.J.; New
Haven, Conn.; Trenton, N.J.; Atlanta; Elizabeth, N.J.; and Los
Angeles.
   The increases could be due in part to Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia, a rare pneumonia that often strikes AIDS patients, the
CDC said. However, seven of the top 12 AIDS cities did not count
such deaths among their increase in pneumonia@flu fatalities, the
agency noted.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, weakens the body's
immune system, allowing a variety of diseases to attack, including
pneumonia. AIDS is transmitted most often through sex and through
contaminated drug needles. More than 74,000 AIDS cases have been
reported in the United States, including nearly 20,000 in drug
abusers.

   Florida's first widespread alligator hunting season
in 26 years ends at midnight tonight, the last chance this year for
hunters to snare a large bull gator that can bring more than $1,000
for its hide and meat.
   The end of the 30-day season will give some a rest from stalking
or skinning.
   ``We've been going pretty much straight out all month. Now we're
going to add everything up and see if it was worth it,'' said Grant
Dunaway, whose processing plant near Immokalee received about 180
alligators caught by some of the 238 hunters, mostly novices who
won their permits in a state lottery.
   Dennis David, head of alligator monitoring for the state Game
and Fresh Water Fish Commission, said hide prices on the
international market have remained stable at $40 to $44 a foot, but
the hunt dropped local gator meat prices about 25 percent to $4 to
$5 a pound.
   Wildlife officials aren't expected to have a final count on the
hunt, in which each hunter had a limit of 15 gators, until later
this year, but the original projection was of about 75 percent of
the maximum 3,570 gators.
   ``From what we can see so far, that seems to be a pretty good
guess,'' Dennis said.
   The impact of the hunt on the state's estimated 1 million
alligators will be studied and new rules for next year's hunt could
be adopted in January, Dennis said.
   Some of the possible revisions could be selecting new sites for
the hunt and loosening regulations to allow people without permits
to transport gators to processing facilities, said Dennis.
   The state established the hunt in response to a proliferation of
the once-threatened species. State wildlife experts credit strong
anti-poaching laws adopted in 1970 as the principal reason for a
twofold population growth in the past 20 years.
   The alligator was removed from the federal endangered species
list in 1977, and since 1981 the state has conducted experimental
hunts in selected areas with heavy gator populations.
   Several poachers were caught during the hunt, but most
infractions by permit holders were minor, including hunting outside
designated boundaries and failing to properly tag their catch.
   ``But for the most part we're quite pleased with the way the
hunt was handled,'' said Dennis. ``We didn't have anyone bitten
like people feared.''
   Most novice hunters hired experienced guides and only one
hunt-related injury has been reported since the season opened Sept.
1.
   A hunter on Lake George in northeast Florida lost part of a
finger when he accidentally discharged a bang-stick, a device that
fires a bullet on impact. Several airboats capsized, but no other
injuries were reported, said commission spokesman John White.
   In Louisiana, which opened its 17th annual 30-day season Sept.
10, 23,800 gators were taken last year. Texas, which resumed
alligator hunts in 1984, issued permits for 1,500 gators for the
16-day season that ended Sept. 18.

   A man angered by a couple's claim that the
government should give them a home and jobs is offering them
airfare back to the Soviet Union, where they lived on the U.S.S.R's
tab for 10 months.
   ``The check is in my pocket. I'll make it out to any airline,
but I won't make it out to them,'' Tom Hogan said Thursday.
   Hogan, owner of Marty's Used Auto Parts, a salvage yard based in
Deptford, N.J., said he decided to make the offer after reading a
newspaper story about Theodore Branch, 41, and his wife Cheryle,
41, of Erie.
   But Branch said in an interview with WJET-TV in Erie he wasn't
interested.
   ``He must be some guy trying to get some free publicity,''
Branch said, calling the offer ``garbage.''
   Branch said he is now looking for work. Phone calls were not
answered at the Erie motel where the Branches had been staying.
   The Branches flew to the Soviet Union after losing their jobs
with a Florida broadcaster. They blame the federal government for
not helping them win back wages and for devaluing property they own
in Pennsylvania by declaring it a flood plain.
   They recently returned from Moscow, claiming that after the
Soviet government had housed and employed the couple, officials at
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow offered to match those benefits. The
couple also said embassy officials promised to reimburse them for
their air fare if they returned to the United States.
   State Department officials denied making the offer. A government
spokesman said the embassy offered the Branches a loan to get home,
which any U.S. citizen can get.
   Hogan said he was amused to read Branch's complaint that no one
from the State Department greeted them when their plane landed in
Washington, D.C. Hogan offered to give them a personal send-off.
   ``I'll put them in my car and deliver them to an international
airport,'' he said.

   A hijacker who killed a co-pilot
and wounded three others aboard a Brazilian jetliner was
hospitalized in stable condition today, authorities said. They
described the man as a ``psychopath.''
   Security forces shot Raimundo Conceicao on Thursday night as he
walked toward a getaway plane with the pilot of the Boeing 737 from
Brazil's domestic airline.
   Conceicao then turned and shot the pilot, wounding him in the
leg, officials said. Conceicao killed co-pilot Salvador Evangelista
and wounded two crew members earlier, they said.
   Conceicao, armed with a .38-caliber pistol, held 105 people
hostage for eight hours aboard the plane. He said he was protesting
the economic policies of President Jose Sarney and wanted the pilot
to crash the jet into a government building.
   The 28-year-old forced the pilot to fly the plane from the
southeastern city of Belo Horizonte to the capital, Brasilia, 150
miles to the southeast, but was told it would not be allowed to
land, officials said. After nearly running out of fuel, it landed
in Goiania, 125 miles southwest of Brasilia and 850 miles northwest
of Rio.
   Spokesman Alcir Pereira of the Santa Genoveva Hospital in
Goiania said today Conceicao had been operated on for three police
gunshot wounds.
   The wounded pilot, Fernando Murillo Silva, and the flight
engineer were in stable condition. A wounded steward was treated
and released, officials said.
   The Boeing 737, with 98 passengers and seven crew members
aboard, was on a routine flight from Porto Velho in the western
Amazon jungle to Rio de Janeiro when the eight-hour ordeal began.
No Americans were aboard, the Air Force Ministry said.
   Twenty minutes after the jet took off from Belo Horizonte, the
hijacker shot the steward and entered the cockpit. He shot co-pilot
Evangelista in the head and the flight engineer in the leg, said
air force spokesman Col. Eden Avolinsque.
   Federal Police Chief Romeu Tuma said Conceicao told the control
tower at Goiania's Santa Genoveva airport that he wanted to ``slam
the Boeing 737 into a ministry building in Brasilia.''
   Air Force Minister Octavio Moreira Lima told The Associated
Press in Brasilia: ``The hijacker told negotiators he wanted to
settle accounts with the president over the country's economic
policies. ... He is a psychopath.''
   Brazil's inflation is running at 25 percent monthly and unions
estimate Brazilians have seen more than 40 percent of their wages
eaten by cost of living increases in the last year.
   Crowds of onlookers swarmed to the airport, which was closed and
sealed off by hundreds of heavily armed police and army troops
dressed in combat gear.
   During negotiations the hijacker, demanding to fly back to
Brasilia, allowed all but pilot Murillo Silva off the jet and
agreed to change to a smaller Brazilian-made Bandeirantes passenger
plane.
   ``We had orders from President Sarney not to negotiate with the
hijacker and not to refuel the plane,'' Brazilian Air Force
spokesman Col. Eden Avolinsque said in Brasilia. ``Police weren't
going to budge.''
   ``The pilot's calm state of mind and patience in negotiating
with the hijacker saved our lives,'' said Joao Lanza, one of the
passengers, praising Murillo Silva.

   A 30-year-old has become the first
American woman to climb to the top of Mt. Everest, the world's
tallest peak, the Nepalese Tourism Ministry said today.
   Stacy Allison, of Portland, Ore., reached the peak of the
29,028-foot mountain Thursday along with an American expedition and
a sherpa guide, the ministry said.
   ``She's in fine shape and on the way down,'' said Dan McConnell,
expedition spokesman in Seattle.
   The 13-member group led by James Frush, a writer and attorney
from Seattle, climbed Everest via the traditional southeast ridge,
the ministry said.
   The chief goal of the expedition was to put the first American
woman at the peak. Allison, a building contractor, is one of three
women on the team, McConnell said.
   Only six other women have ever scaled Everest. The first, Junko
Tebei of Japan, reached the summit in 1975. The most recent was two
years ago by Sharon Wood of Canada.
   Four of the women scaled Everest via the southeastern route, and
two by the little-traversed North Face.

   Six former secretaries of defense agreed
today the new openness in the Soviet Union may provide an
opportunity for the United States to rethink defense strategies.
   But the six said any change in U.S. policy must be done from a
position of strength.
   Robert McNamara, Melvin Laird, Elliot Richardson, James
Schlesinger, Donald Rumsfeld and Harold Brown participated in a
discussion moderated by television broadcaster Edwin Newman.
   The forum, sponsored by the Atlanta-based Southern Center for
International Studies, was taped and will be shown Nov. 6 by the
Public Broadcasting Service.
   McNamara said the United States could reconsider its strategies
in light of statements by Mikhail Gorbechev that war between the
superpowers is no longer an acceptable means of reaching Soviet
goals.
   But McNamara, who served as secretary of defense in the Kennedy
and Johnson administrations, said the United States must probe the
extent to which the Soviets are willing to reduce political tension
in the Western Hemisphere and around the world.
   ``We have had enticing statements from Mr. Gorbachev ... indeed
enticing statements go back to Lenin,'' said Schlesinger, who
served under presidents Nixon and Ford.
   It would be ``imprudent'' for the United States to reduce its
forces as long as Soviet power needs to be matched, he said.
   ``We can't take mere statements by the Soviet leadership and
bank them,' agreed Laird, who also served under Nixon.
   Laird said one way the United States could know whether the
Soviets were serious would be to verify a reduction in Soviet
defense spending.
   ``We do have to be careful of how we proceed,'' Brown said. But
the United States could also take the initiative in making arms
reduction proposals, said Brown, who served under President Carter.
   ``Gorbachev has been making the pace. He has been getting the
credit,'' he said.
   It was the second time the former secretaries of defense have
gathered for a discussion of foreign policy and defense issues in a
forum sponsored by the Southern Center for International Studies.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, campaigning in
rural Texas, promised today to devote $100 million for investment
in farm areas and said that his Republican presidential rival is
pursuing an agricultural policy of ``the fewer farmers the better.''
   At a rally on a farm in west Texas, Dukakis said that rural
America is filled with ``monuments to the neglect and indifference
and incompetence of Mr. (George) Bush and his friends.
   ``Farms and ranches abandoned or foreclosed, banks and hospitals
shut down, storefronts boarded up. Communities fighting to
survive.''
   The Democratic presidential nominee's emphasis on rural
development came a day after he and Bush traded charges over Social
Security, specifically whether they had both once supported
proposals for a one-year freeze in benefit cost-of-living
adjustments.
   Bush cast a tie-breaking Senate vote in favor of such a freeze
in 1985. Dukakis supported a National Governors Association
resolution that included such a freeze earlier in the same year.
   The Massachusetts governor told a news conference in Dallas
Thursday that he voted for the NGA resolution only after first
fighting to delete the benefits freeze from it.
   At the farm rally, Dukakis said, ``The Republicans put America
on the auction block. They've been selling off our farms and
businesses and banks and real estate to the Japanese and the Saudis
and the Germans and others.''
   Recalling Bush's call for a ``kinder and gentler America'' in
his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention,
Dukakis asked if the vice president's idea of a kinder and gentler
America was ``foreclosing on American farmers, letting our small
towns die?''
   ``Mr. Bush's farm policy can be summed up in five words: the
fewer farmers the better. And the Republican rural development
policy can be summed up in two words: tough luck.''
   Dukakis said that as president he would push for improved rural
health care and schools and would designate $100 million of his
proposed Fund to Rebuild America for investment in rural areas ``to
help small businesses get the financing the need to create new jobs
and to save old ones, and to bring the industries of the future to
the rural towns and counties of this country.''
   At a news conference in Michigan Thursday, Bush struck back on
the Social Security issue.
   ``I was a little surprised to see this demogoguery from the man
who had exactly the same position that the president had on that
one-year slipping of the COLAs,'' the GOP nominee said.
   Throughout the Reagan years, Social Security has consistently
worked as an issue for Democrats running against Republicans.
   Dukakis has relished using it against Bush.
   In speeches he cites Bush's plan for a capital gains tax cut,
the vice president's support for increases in defense spending and
then says if Bush is going to reduce the deficit ``how's he going
to do it without raiding the Social Security trust fund.''
   The Democratic nominee also quotes Bush as calling Social
Security ``basically a welfare program,'' a quote that invariably
draws boos from partisan audiences.
   At his news conference, Bush said, ``I want to keep that Social
Security trust fund sound and I will do that and I will not permit
it to be raided for social spending programs.''
   For several years, the nation's governors debated proposals
urging President Reagan and Congress to act on the budget deficit
through a combination of cuts in defense spending and tax increases.
   Reagan consistently rejected their appeals although in 1985 he
relented and temporarily endorsed the freeze passed by the Senate
with bipartisan support.
   Reagan later backed away from his support for including Social
Security benefits in the freeze and the whole plan died.
   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential
nominee, voted in May 1984 to support a one-year delay in Social
Security COLAs and in May 1985, he supported a six-month delay.
   Mike McCurry, Bentsen's campaign spokesman, said that in May
1985 the Texas senator supported the Democratic alternative to an
``underlying Republican effort to cut the COLA.''
   The Republican are trying to ``distort the record,'' he said.
``They can run but they can't hide.''

   Discovery's astronauts, achieving
their crucial task of satellite delivery ``with considerable
precision,'' settled into a workmanlike routine today, performing
scientific experiments and taking time out for sightseeing and
Mozart.
   ``The launch and us getting back to space is something that
really means a lot to me,'' said Richard Truly, the NASA shuttle
director who supervised the post-Challenger recovery. ``And looking
at today's front pages, I think it means a lot to the country.
   ``There'll never be another countdown that meant so much,'' he
said in an ABC interview.
   With the triumph of Thursday's launch behind them, the Discovery
crew began its workday 184 miles above the Central Atlantic, just
after 5:30 a.m. EDT.
   Mission Control supplied a morning wake-up that began with a
loud and bracing, ``G-o-o-d Morning, Discovery!'' Robin Williams,
who perfected his deejay routine in the movie, ``Good Morning
Vietnam,'' prepared the tape for a Houston radio station.
   The crew learned immediately that the NASA satellite they
released Thursday evening had arrived overnight at it work station
high above Earth.
   ``We're there. We're on orbit. We're very, very happy,'' Ed
Bangsund of Boeing said today. The firm manufactured the rocket
stage that sent the satellite to its final orbit. Following the
Challenger accident in 1986, the nation's unmanned satellite
delivery system suffered another series of set backs and no one was
taking anything for granted.
   Air Force satellite controllers in Sunnyvale, Calif., messaged
the Discovery crew that ``the final velocity shortfall is an
amazing zero-point-one feet per second,'' which Mission Control
called a feat ``of some considerable precision.'' It means the
satellite was sent into precisely the right orbit.
   Today's relatively quiet schedule contrasts with the tense drama
of fire and thunder as Discovery rocketed into orbit Thursday and
revived an American space program that had been devastated 32
months earlier by the explosion of Challenger and the death of its
seven crew members.
   ``We sure appreciate your all getting us up in orbit the way we
should be,'' Discovery's commander, Frederick H. Hauck, told
Mission Control soon after he and his four crew members achieved
orbit 184 miles above Earth.
   ``We're looking forward to the next four days _ we have a lot to
do and we're going to have a lot of fun doing it.'' Today, the crew
was asked to photograph ``some of the natural phenomena of the
planet Earth'' _ including Pacific thunderstorms, a volcano lava
flow in Ethiopia and coastal erosion damage from the Hurricane
Gilbert on the Yucaton Peninsula.
   Today's flight plan was deliberately conservative to enable the
crew to carefully check the scores of system modifications made in
the spacecraft since the Challenger explosion. ``We're not breaking
any new ground,'' pilot Richard Covey said before the launch.
   Little more than six hours into the mission, crewmen John M.
Lounge and David C. Hilmers, operating from a panel inside the
cabin, released a $100 million Tracking and Data Relay Satellite.
The craft was sprung from a tilt-table that raised out of the cargo
bay and it glided effortlessly into an orbit all its own.
   An hour later, after Hauck and Covey maneuvered Discovery to a
safe distance, a timing device ignited a rocket attached to the
giant satellite and propelled it toward a stationary
22,300-mile-high orbit. A rocket motor that fired early today
placed it in a circular orbit.
   There, it will serve as a space switchboard for relaying
communications between ground stations, future shuttle flights and
up to 25 other orbiting satellites. Secure channels on board will
enable the Defense Department to keep in touch with
intelligence-gathering spacecraft.
   NASA and the Pentagon considered the satellite so important it
was scheduled as the cargo for the first post-Challenger mission.
An earlier one, launched from a shuttle in 1983, is not working
fully. A second was lost in the Challenger explosion. Another is
set for launch in January.
   The flight plan for the remainder of the four-day mission is
filled with 11 science and technology experiments, checks of scores
of spacecraft modifications and a news conference from space Sunday.
   Today's schedule included turning on a furnace for processing
materials, photographing lightning in the atmosphere and testing
the effect of weightlessness on red blood cells.
   In charge of the experiments is astronomer-turned-astronaut
George D. Nelson, who said he planned to spend much of his leisure
time stargazing. Each astronaut brought music cassettes for quiet
times. The works ranged from Willie Nelson to Mozart. The fifth
crewman is David C. Hilmers.
   During a televised segment from space today, Nelson and Hilmers
demonstrated an experiment involving cell separation in
weightlessness. Hilmers explained it could have medical
applications such as separating malignant from non-malignant cells.
   In Earth's gravity, when materials like the astronauts are
testing are mixed, the lighter one tends to float to the top.
   Hilmers said in zero gravity it's more like a yoke floating
inside the egg white.
   ``One of the things this can show,'' said Hilmers, ``is the use
of people in space to look at experiments and see any changes. We
can take pictures if we see unique changes and possibly modify the
experiment.''
   Discovery is set to land at 12:32 p.m. EDT Monday on Rogers Dry
Lake at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   Ice in vents caused an early problem with a cooling system used
during launch and re-entry. To help melt the ice, controllers told
the astronauts to raise the temperature in their primary cooling
system.
   This raised the cabin temperature to the mid-80s, forcing the
astronauts to turn up their fans and drink extra water. By 4 a.m.,
the cabin was 79 degrees, which Mission Control described as ``very
comfortable for them.''
   The crew will remember the five men and two women of Challenger
in a special way. Hauck said the nature of the memorial will be
disclosed Sunday.
   Back on Earth, officials in and out of the space agency were
ecstatic Thursday about America's return to space.
   ``Wow!'' said NASA administrator James C. Fletcher. ``It's been
a long wait.''
   ``Everyone certainly stood tall today,'' Kennedy Space Center
director Forrest S. McCartney told his launch team.
   President Reagan saluted the crew's bravery and added, ``We ask
God to bless this important voyage.''
   Launch, at 11:37 a.m. EDT, came only after NASA waived weather
guidelines to allow for flight through some lighter-than-usual
Florida winds. The 98-minute delay simply heightened the tension as
NASA unveiled a spaceship that underwent more than 400
modifications since the Challenger disaster Jan. 28, 1986.
   Officials were preparing to analyze the performance of the
redesigned solid fuel booster rockets. A faulty joint was blamed
for the Challenger's destruction.
   ``From everything I see, everything looks great,'' said J.R.
Thompson, who directed the work from the Marshall Space Flight
Center in Alabama.
   Anxiety was highest Thursday as the ship went through a
30-second period of severe aerodynamic stress. It was during this
stage of the flight the Challenger rockets failed.
   Some television viewers reported what they thought was an errant
flame shooting from the left booster rocket about 90 seconds after
liftoff.

   Police rescued a kidnapped woman from the trunk
of a car and arrested a man in the incident, but they were still
searching today for a $20,000 ransom left at a phone booth,
authorities said.
   Jung-Ok Chung, 28, who spent about 14 hours in the trunk of a
stolen Cadillac, was treated for trauma at Booth Memorial Hospital
and released Thursday, said Sgt. Peter Sweeney, a police spokesman.
   She was abducted at gunpoint in front of her apartment building
in Queens about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday and placed in the trunk of a
car, Sweeney said.
   The victim's family was contacted numerous times and a ransom
demand was made.
   ``He said he wanted $50,000 or he was going to kill her,'' said
Capt. Charles Alifano.
   A deal was reached for the ransom to be paid Thursday afternoon
at a Queens phone booth. The victim's restaurateur father, whose
name was not released, went there with $20,000 in cash _ ``all he
could raise,'' Sweeney said.
   Watched by detectives, he left the money in the booth.
   A man pulled up in a car. When an officer approached him, the
man reached for the glove compartment, where a gun was hidden,
Alifano said.
   ``We immediately arrested him after a brief struggle,'' Sweeney
said.
   Chung was found in the car's trunk, but the money was forgotten.
   A half hour after the arrest, Chung's father remembered he had
left it in the phone booth, Sweeney said.
   Police went back to the corner, but it was gone.
   Anje Lee, 28, who refused to give police an address, was charged
with kidnapping and criminal possession of a deadly weapon, Sweeney
said. He had four fully loaded guns with him, Alifano said.

<TEXT>
   More than three dozen children were
kept home from an elementary school today amid rumors that a
satanic cult was looking for a blond, blue-eyed child to kidnap and
sacrifice.
   ``Yesterday we had 52 students out,'' said Principal Freddie
Keen of Wallace Heights Elementary School in Kanawha County.
``Today we're down to 43, and six of them their parents called to
say they are sick.''
   The rumors have spread into adjacent Putnam County, where the
sheriff's department reported receiving 50 calls from worried
parents. One elementary school secretary said she had received
numerous calls from parents who wanted to make sure teachers
watched while students were on the playground or boarded buses.
   Police say they've found no evidence to support the rumors, but
some parents say they've heard rumors that a satanic cult has been
mutilating dogs and is searching for a blond, blue-eyed child to
sacrifice.
   ``I've heard them. The parents have heard them,'' Keen said.
   ``Obviously, there are some very concerned and frightened
children,'' Kanawha County Schools Superintendent Richard Trumble
said after Thursday's absences from Wallace Heights.
   ``There's no physical evidence,'' Keen said. ``The rumors have
been going on for weeks.''
   Police agree there is no evidence of a satanic cult.
   ``All the calls we get are checked out,'' said a sheriff's
deputy. ``But it keeps going back to rumors and rumors. We can't
validate any of this garbage.''
   Trumble met with Wallace Heights staff Thursday and said
security has been tightened.
   ``We're attempting to secure the doors of the school by putting
locks on them,'' Trumble said. ``The reality is public schools were
never really designed to be secure places. Even in locking the
doors, we're concerned about violating the fire codes.''
   Police in neighboring eastern Kentucky said in mid-September
that they fielded thousands of phone calls from residents spooked
by tales of devil worship and abduction. Rumors had been reported
in 25 counties since late July.
   Most of the rumors were similar to the West Virginia ones, that
Satan worshipers were looking for blond, blue-eyed children to
sacrifice. Some versions said followers needed to round up several
children before Halloween.
   Many Kentucky officials thought the rumors may have been sparked
by a July grave robbery in Breathitt County, in which four adults
and two juveniles were arrested. A pentacle, or five-pointed star,
and videotapes and books on the occult were found in a trailer the
defendants allegedly used for satanic ceremonies.
   Kanawha County Sheriff's Capt. W.T. Markham said today he was
unaware of the eastern Kentucky rumors and knew of no connection.

   Federal health inspectors and Pentagon
investigators have begun a joint probe of claims by Lockheed
workers that they are endangered by chemicals believed to be used
in making the top-secret Stealth fighter.
   A three-member team from the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration made a visit Thursday to the aerospace company's
Burbank plant, where 75 employees have filed suit complaining they
suffer from ailments brought on by exposure to hazardous substances
used in their top-secret jobs.
   A team of military physicians, toxic material experts and other
specialists from the Department of Defense are expected to be at
the plant by Monday, according to an announcement Thursday by Rep.
Howard Berman, D-Calif., whose district includes the Los Angeles
suburb where the plant is located.
   In addition to the lawsuit, about 150 employees have filed
worker's compensation claims related to exposure to the chemicals.
   The employees, some of whom work in Lockheed's highly classified
plant nicknamed the ``Skunk Works,'' where the U-2 reconnaissance
planes were built, have said the top-secret nature of their jobs
has hampered their efforts to seek treatment from private
physicians.
   Attorney Timothy Larson, who represents the workers in the suit
and compensation claims, said five of his clients and an unknown
number of workers have died since 1986.
   Lockheed workers claim composite materials used in the Stealth
fighter, designed not to reflect radar, and chemicals used to mill
or clean them are causing rashes, nausea, dizziness, memory loss
and lack of concentration, Berman said.
   Similar symptoms have been cited in the Seattle area by workers
at Boeing plants, where many of the same materials are used on
commercial aircraft.
   In Washington, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee
wants to determine whether workers in aerospace facilities with DOD
contracts are being exposed to hazardous chemicals without adequate
protection.
   No state or federal OSHA inspector has conducted a full-scale
inspection of the top-secret Skunk Works since the safety agency
was founded 16 years ago, high-ranking OSHA sources told the Los
Angeles Times this week.
   An OSHA inspector with a nuclear-materials security clearance
from the Department of Energy was admitted to the secure section of
the plant Thursday and will remain there for several days, an OSHA
official told the Los Angeles Times.
   ``He will look first into the specific complaints contained in
the lawsuit and media reports and after that will decide whether to
expand this into a wall-to-wall general inspection,'' said the
spokesman, not identified by the Times.

   A district judge criticized for the way he treated
women in some domestic abuse cases has resigned.
   Somerville District Judge Henry A. Tempone termed it a
``decision to retire'' in his letter Thursday to Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis. The effective date is Dec. 31.
   Tempone, appointed to the bench in 1970, became eligible for
retirement when he turned 65 in 1987, but under state law could
serve until he reached the age of 70 in 1992.
   A one-paragraph statement from the state Supreme Judicial Court
announcing Tempone's departure said, ``From now until the date of
his retirement, Judge Tempone will not sit on any ... domestic
abuse cases.'' Court spokeswoman Joan Kenney said she could not
elaborate.
   A secretary for Tempone said the judge would not answer
questions on his resignation.
   In July, advocates for battered women had called for Tempone's
immediate removal or, at the least, an order for him to stop
presiding over domestic cases.
   The Commission on Judicial Conduct had investigated complaints
against Tempone. The commission's report remains sealed by the high
court.
   Tempone had been openly rebuked by chief trial court presiding
Judge Samuel Zoll in November for acting impatiently and
insensitively in cases where women were seeking protection orders.
   Thursday's announcement came one day after the Supreme Court
censured another Somerville district judge, Paul A. Heffernan, for
``discourtesy, rudeness and sarcasm'' in a domestic abuse case.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush received
endorsements today from northern New Jersey law officers and told
them that a criminal who kills a policeman should ``pay with his
life.''
   The Bush campaign hastily added an afternoon stop in
Springfield, Mass., where Bush expected to win the support of yet
another police group in rival Michael Dukakis' home state.
   ``We should have much more sympathy for the victims of crime
than we have for the criminals and that's the kind of judge I'll
appoint to the federal bench,'' he said.
   Bush criticized Massachusetts' prison furlough program again,
and said Dukakis had a ``basic revolving door program for murderers
who have not even served enough time for parole.''
   Bush said someone convicted of a drug-related murder or killing
police officers ``should pay with his life.''
   Bush's sentiments were echoed by those endorsing him today.
   ``Under a Bush administration, criminals won't get weekend
furloughs so they can go out and commit more crimes,'' said Mike
Adamo, president of the Paterson Policeman's Benevolent Association.
   Also endorsing Bush were the Passaic County Sheriff's Officers
and Correction Officers and two small police groups and a firemen's
association.
   Bush was also scheduled to pick up the endorsement of two
municipal police unions in Springfield. A week ago, Bush was
endorsed by Boston police; Dukakis countered with a law
officer-packed rally of his own.
   Bush praised New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean for his work on
environmental problems in New Jersey and blasted Dukakis on that
issue.
   ``You try to drink the water out of Boston Harbor lately? Don't
do it,'' he said. He did not mention that Boston Harbor is salt
water, but he poked fun at one of his earlier gaffes.
   ``I may have a little trouble remembering Pearl Harbor, but I
don't have any trouble remembering Boston Harbor,'' he said.
   Bush said Thursday that the American people have a right to know
whether Dukakis would heed the advice of the ACLU in choosing
judges for the high court.
   ``I just asked him (Dukakis) to clarify that for us,'' said
Bush, who for the first time suggested that the Democrat might
follow the ACLU's advice. ``I think it's a good question to ask.
All he has to say is, no, they won't have any influence on him.''
   Bush, in a speech to a community college in Mount Clemens,
Mich., said he wants judges on the court who have ``a little more
compassion for the victims of crime and a little less for the
criminals.''
   Meanwhile, Bush dismissed as ``demagoguery'' Dukakis' contention
that the Republican candidate would ``raid'' the Social Security
trust fund to help trim the deficit.
   Dukakis has cited Bush's tie-breaking vote in the Senate in 1985
on a budget resolution that backed a six-month freeze on
cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security recipients.
   Bush said Dukakis supported ``exactly the same thing'' in a 1985
meeting of the National Governor's Conference.
   Dukakis voted against a resolution backing such a freeze the
first time around, but then voted for the overall package of
resolutions on a final vote.
   Sheila Tate, Bush's press spokeswoman, acknowledged that
Dukakis' first vote was cast against the proposed freeze, but she
called that just ``preliminary skirmishing.''
   Bush said he would keep the Social Security fund ``sound and I
will not permit it to be raided for social spending programs.''
   The vice president also defended anew his running mate, Sen. Dan
Quayle of Indiana.
   ``I think it's rather demeaning for their head of the ticket to
keep going after Dan Quayle,'' Bush said. ``It shows a certain
insecurity, a certain weakness on his (Dukakis') part.''
   In another development, the Los Angeles Times reported today
that Bush, during his tenure as CIA director, fought the Justice
Department's criminal investigation of senior CIA officials,
including former director Richard Helms, and an inquiry into the
agency's operations in Chile during the early 1970s.
   The newspaper, citing newly released files in the Gerald R. Ford
presidential library in Ann Arbor, Mich., said Bush sought to
prevent some documents from being declassified and witnesses from
being called before a federal grand jury. Former President Ford
later instructed Bush to let federal prosecutors have what they
needed.
   In 1977, Helms pleaded no contest to two criminal charges of
failing to testify ``fully, completely and accurately'' to Congress.
   Mark Goodin, a Bush spokesman, had no comment on the report.
   Earlier Thursday, Bush applauded the successful launch of the
space shuttle ``Discovery'' and pledged his support for space
programs. But the GOP nominee said, if elected, he would not engage
the Soviets in a race to the planets.
   ``I don't think we just need to race: if they (the Soviets) go
to planet X, we have to be at planet X sooner,'' Bush said. ``I
think the next major responsibility of the president is to sit down
with the specialists after this flight and talk about what should
the priority be.''
   Bush told reporters he opposes a manned flight to Mars at this
time, given current budget constraints.
   Bush plans to attend the return of ``Discovery'' on Monday.
Aides to the vice president said Bush made the decision after a
phone call to President Reagan on Thursday shortly after the launch.

   The House today approved 327-77 a bill to pay
for Pentagon programs, hours after the White House announced
President Reagan had signed separate legislation authorizing the
Defense Department's budget.
   The actions were part of an agreement between the
Democratic-controlled Congress and the White House as Congress
tried to finish a crowded agenda of spending bills needed before a
new fiscal year begins Saturday.
   The Senate was expected to vote later on the bill appropriating
money for the Pentagon. The complicated federal budget process
involves legislation to authorize programs, followed by separate
bills to actually provide the money needed to pay those bills.
   The measure signed by Reagan is similar to one he vetoed last
month, but restores the defense spending priorities he requested in
a veto message.
   Because of that Aug. 3 veto, congressional leaders said they
wouldn't vote on the defense appropriation bill until Reagan first
signed the authorizing measure. The authorization and appropriation
bills are virtually identical.
   The bill signed by Reagan was approved by the House, 369-48, on
Wednesday afternoon. Three hours later, the Senate passed it, 91-4.
   The measure authorizes the Pentagon to spend $300 billion in the
fiscal year beginning Saturday, the same total contained in the
bill Reagan vetoed Aug. 3. That represents a slight cut from this
year's $301 billion defense budget.
   The appropriation bill is for $282 billion in the fiscal year
starting Saturday. The total is smaller because some of the
programs in the authorization measure are in future years.
   The bills include a 4.1 percent pay raise for the nation's 2.1
million uniformed military personnel.
   While both bills contain the same reductions in Reagan's
proposed Star Wars budget as the bill he vetoed, the earlier bill's
congressionally mandated restrictions on internal spending in the
Star Wars program were removed.
   The Strategic Defense Initiative, as the Star Wars anti-missile
research program is formally known, would receive $4.1 billion,
compared to the $4.8 billion sought by Reagan and the $3.9 billion
authorized for this year.
   The Pentagon wanted to spend up to $330 million of the SDI money
on a space-based interceptor weapon, the first stage of an early
deployment SDI program. The previous measure would have restricted
that to $85 million, but the new measure removes that limit.
   The new bills also remove a restriction on flight testing of
``depressed trajectory'' missiles, which fly relatively low instead
of into space as do other long-range atomic missiles. The United
States has none of the weapons under development and no plans for
testing, but the Soviets are believed to be developing the weapons.
   The new bills also rewrote the complicated spending plan for the
MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles, two weapons at the heart of a
dispute over the future of America's land-based nuclear missile
force.
   The original bill proposed spending $250 million each for
studies of the Midgetman and a railroad-based version of the MX and
provided another $250 million to be used for either program next
year by the next president.
   The new bills provide $250 million for the Midgetman and $600
million for the MX-on-rails program, but say no more than $250
million of the MX money can be spent before Feb. 15. The remaining
$350 million could be re-allocated by whomever wins the presidency
Nov. 8.

   The mother of the man accused of killing
two children and wounding nine people in an elementary school
shooting rampage says her heart goes out to the victims' families.
   ``It has just really been hard on all of us,'' said Shirley
Bordnor, mother of 19-year-old James William Wilson. ``It has just
torn me apart inside. It has broken my heart inside.''
   She said her sympathy goes out to ``all of those families'' of
the victims.
   As a second schoolgirl died Thursday, the father of the other
dead girl said he still couldn't believe this week's events.
   ``Anyone that would harm innocent little children, they are
really deranged, I mean something is absolutely wrong,'' Moses
Bradley said after arranging for this afternoon's funeral for his
8-year-old daughter, Shequila.
   ``This week has been really terrible,'' he said, his eyes red
from tears.
   Tequila Thomas 8, lost her battle for life Thursday after
undergoing two operations. Her funeral was set for Sunday.
   Police Chief James Coursey said Wilson was charged Thursday with
a second count of murder, along with nine counts of assault and
battery with intent to kill.
   Police say Wilson quietly entered Oakland Elementary School on
Monday morning and began shooting at students and teachers in the
cafeteria and in a third-grade classroom.
   Wilson is undergoing psychological testing at the State Hospital
in Columbia.
   The Greenville News reported today that a state mental health
center rejected two attempts since 1986 by Wilson's relatives to
have him involuntarily committed for psychiatric care. Relatives
have described him as a hyperactive recluse who has been in and out
of a hospital psychiatric unit during the past eight months.
   Retired Probate Judge Rosemary M. Trakas said Wilson's family
filed affidavits for involuntary commitment and Wilson was
evaluated by a state mental health center.
   She told the newspaper that, after the evaluation, officials
declined to admit Wilson into the state mental hospital system.
   The Department of Mental Health ``can't confirm or deny that a
person has been a patient or has received treatment from the
department,'' spokeswoman Susan Craft said today. ``That's the law.
It's a confidentiality statute.''
   Wilson told The State newspaper of Columbia that during the
shooting he was thinking about crimes he had read about, and about
the teasing he received while in school for being overweight and
dressing strangely.
   Wilson said he had stayed up all night before the shootings,
reading a book about John Wayne Gacy, who is on Illinois' death row
for killing 33 men and boys. He also mentioned a magazine article
about Laurie Dann, the 30-year-old baby sitter who shot six
children in a Chicago-area elementary school in May.
   Most of Oakland's 600 students returned to school Thursday for
the first time since Monday's shootings, and Principal Eleanor Rice
said things ``went extremely well.''
   But ``certainly anything of this magnitude, it's going to take
some time to recover,'' Mrs. Rice said.
   Schools Superintendent Robert Watson said teachers did not tell
children of the second death because they felt it would be better
if the parents broke the news.
   Watson said 30 students were identified as needing counseling.
   ``There were a variety of different activities in the classroom
where they allowed the children to act out some of their
feelings,'' he said. ``Several teachers felt they saw a lot of
anger.''
   Leah Holmes, 8, her arm in a sling from a gunshot wound, shook
her head emphatically and said ``Nope,'' when asked Thursday
morning if she was scared to go back to school. But other children
and parents arriving at the school were less sure.
   ``We're a little nervous, but it's just been a shock
primarily,'' said Alan Maxwell, as he walked his daughter Katy to
school. Katy said she didn't hear the gunshots but remembers a
teacher coming into her classroom and telling everyone to duck
under the desks.
   Two teachers wounded remain hospitalized in good condition,
Linda Miller, Self Memorial Hospital nursing supervisor, said
today. She also said one student was readmitted Thursday in fair
condition. The others were released.

<HEAD>NYPD Lifts Ban on Plastic Handgun</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIRGINIA BYRNE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Police Department has lifted a four-year ban
on the Glock handgun, which critics have called a potential
terrorist weapon out of fear that its plastic parts would make it
difficult to detect.
   Department tests indicated that ``this is not one of the
undetectable plastic weapons,'' said Robert Goldman, deputy
commissioner for legal matters.
   The department, which has tested the lightweight, semiautomatic
pistol for several years, made the decision Thursday in connection
with an appeal filed in March by a gun enthusiast, Goldman said.
   The department's top lawyer admitted the timing of the decision
was precipitated by the publicity generated by an Associated Press
report Wednesday that Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward was
licensed to carry the 9mm weapon.
   ``Perhaps I would have made this decision next week,'' Goldman
said. ``Rather than keep a controversy going, you know, why this
and why that, we'll give you the answers up front.''
   City residents will now be able to apply for permits to own the
guns, and they may also be issued to police officers in the
department's Narcotics, Intelligence and Emergency Service units.
   The gun's clip can hold up to 17 rounds of ammunition, compared
to the police-authorized .38-caliber revolvers, which hold six
rounds.
   The department originally banned the gun because ``it seemed
very prudent not to jump and summarily authorize something that on
its surface appeared to be a plastic weapon,'' he said. ``That's
the way the Glock was advertised, that's the way it was perceived.''
   The department started testing the Austrian-made weapon, which
retails for about $500, in 1986. It has a plastic frame but the
barrel and some other parts are metal. It has a 4}-inch barrel and
weighs about 24 ounces with an empty clip.
   Initially, there was concern that the weapon could not be
detected by magnetic and X-ray devices such as those used at
airports.
   Police sources, speaking on the condition they not be
identified, described the commissioner as embarrassed and upset
after the AP reported that a copy of Ward's gun license, dated July
6, showed he had a Glock.
   Ward said Tuesday that death threats prompted him to carry a
weapon and ``sometimes a machine gun'' wherever he goes.
   So far, Ward is the only person in the Police Department
authorized to carry the department-owned weapon, and the only
person in New York City registered to possess the Glock, one of a
dozen owned by the department.

   Michael Dukakis, attacking George Bush in rural Texas, said
today Republican policy on hard-pressed farmers and ranchers ``can
be summed up in two words: Tough luck.'' Bush, in turn, called
Dukakis' homestate prisoner furlough program a ``revolving door for
murderers.''
   The latest tough talk from the presidential candidates came one
day after they exchanged long-distance rhetorical barbs over Social
Security and other issues.
   Dukakis told a crowd at a farm rally in Idalou, Texas, that if
he is elected he will devote $100 million for investment in farm
areas.
   Recalling Bush's call for a ``kinder and gentler America'' in
his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention,
Dukakis asked if the vice president's idea of a kinder and gentler
America was ``foreclosing on American farmers, letting our small
towns die?''
   ``Mr. Bush's farm policy can be summed up in five words: the
fewer farmers the better. And the Republican rural development
policy can be summed up in two words: tough luck.''
   Dukakis said rural America is filled with ``monuments to the
neglect and indifference and incompetence of Mr. Bush and his
friends. Farms and ranches abandoned or foreclosed, banks and
hospitals shut down, storefronts boarded up. Communities fighting
to survive.''
   Bush traveled to Paterson, N.J., to pick up the endorsement of
local law enforcement officers, and also planned later in the day
to accept the endorsement of a Springfield, Mass., police group _
his second such trip to Massachusetts in an effort to tweak Dukakis.
   ``We should have much more sympathy for the victims of crime
than we have for the criminals and that's the kind of judge I'll
appoint to the federal bench,'' Bush said, speaking from the steps
of the Paterson Municipal Complex.
   He said Dukakis, as governor of Massachusetts, had a ``basic
revolving door program for murderers who have not even served
enough time for parole.''
   President Reagan was back on the campaign trail for his vice
president, taking up Bush's attack on Dukakis' membership in the
American Civil Liberties Union. In a speech prepared for delivery
in Chicago, Reagan said, ``You recall a few years back, political
figures had to disassociate themselves from groups on the right
with far-out views. Isn't it now time for responsible people to do
the same thing with far-out groups on the left?''
   Meanwhile, a new Gallup Poll, taken Tuesday and Wednesday among
1,020 registered voters, said Bush was favored by 47 percent to
Dukakis' 42 percent. The poll had a 3 percent plus-or-minus margin
of potential sampling error.
   On Thursday, Bush dismissed Dukakis' criticisms of the
Republican nominee's vote to freeze Social Security benefits,
citing a similar stance by the Democrat three years ago.
   The GOP presidential nominee, turning the tables on an issue the
Democrats have used against him, said Thursday that at the National
Governors' Association meeting in February 1985 Dukakis voted for a
resolution calling for an overall freeze of Social Security
benefits.
   Dukakis has criticized Bush for casting a tie-breaking Senate
vote in May 1985 to approve legislation that included a one-year
freeze on Social Security cost-of-living adjustments.
   ``He supported exactly the same thing he was attacking me on the
other night,'' Bush said referring to charges Dukakis leveled
during Sunday night's debate.
   The Massachusetts governor acknowledged Thursday that he cast
his vote for the resolution, but noted that initially he supported
a proposal to delete Social Security from a list of programs to be
covered by a one-year freeze.
   The two vice presidential candidates _ Republican Dan Quayle and
Democrat Lloyd Bentsen _ were devoting much of their time to
preparing for their debate Wednesday in Omaha, Neb.
   Bentsen was addressing a rally in Charlotte, N.C., and the
National Education Association in Washington, D.C. Quayle was
spending the day poring over debate briefing books and meeting with
advisers before traveling to Philadelphia tonight for the Great
American Firehouse Exposition and Muster.
   After a day of trading one-liners, Bush lashed out at Dukakis
for suggesting that the GOP nominee would ``raid'' the Social
Security trust fund to cut the federal deficit.
   ``I was a little surprised to see this demagoguery from the man
who had exactly the same position that the president had on that
one-year slipping of the COLAs,'' the vice president said.
   Dukakis said he voted for the overall freeze after the effort to
protect Social Security increases failed. The Democratic nominee
said the vote was ``a general expression of my concern for the
deficit, but I made it very, very clear that I was opposed to
cutting cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients.''
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis attacked the Reagan administration's
record on the environment, using an appearance at Rutgers
University in New Brunswick, N.J., to denounce Republican efforts
to cleanup toxic waste sites and stem the tide of medical wastes
washing up on New Jersey shores.
   ``For the foot-draggers and chronic polluters, I have just one
message,'' Dukakis said. ``You better vote for Mr. Bush, because if
I'm elected the game is over _ no more of the sweetheart deals and
delayed cleanups and half-baked compromises that we've seen over
the past seven and a half years.''
   Several weeks ago, Bush had traveled to New Jersey where he
proclaimed, ``I am an environmentalist.''
   ``Calling George Bush an environmentalist is like calling Dan
Quayle a statesman,'' said Dukakis who was joined by a
conservationist who bristles at comments on his resemblance to
Quayle _ actor Robert Redford.

   President Reagan warned today that military
weakness ``is to invite war'' as he called on political leaders to
shun ``far-out group on the left.''
   In remarks prepared for delivery to community leaders in
Chicago, Reagan recalled the Munich agreement of a half-century ago
that was hoped to achieve peace, but was followed by war within a
months.
   ``To be weak is to invite war,'' Reagan said, yet ``even today
there are those who have forgotten the ancient principle of peace
through strength.''
   ``And their innocence and neivete would put in questiom all that
we have achieved ... all the progress toward ending the twin evils
of totalitarianism and nuclear terror,'' said Reagan.
   His speech was scheduled only a few hours after he signed a $300
billion defense appropriation bill, after Congress voted changes
that caused him to veto the measure in August.
   Taking up Vice President George Bush's anti-liberal cudgel,
Reagan said that Democrat Michael Dukakis' performance in last
Sunday's debate was what could be expected from an American Civil
Liberties Union member: ``He didn't have a prayer.''
   Questioning the positions of the ACLU, Reagan added: ``You
recall a few years back, political figures had to disassociate
themselves from groups on the right with far-out views.
   ``Isn't it now time for responsible people to do the same thing
with far-out groups on the left?''
   In Chicago, Reagan's first stop was Wozniak's Casino, a Polish
social hall on the city's southwest side.
   The president was to address some 1,200 local and community
supporters at the establishment, which features one of the oldest
bowling alleys in the country.
   Tonight, Reagan speaks at a $250-per-ticket GOP rally on the
floor of the Mercantile Exchange. He also planned to attend a
private reception for major GOP donors, where the president
traditionally poses for pictures with big-money contributors.
   With 24 electoral votes, Illinois is one of the richest prizes
in the presidential race. Republicans hope to win it by keeping in
the fold moderate Democrats that voted for Reagan in 1980 and 1984.
   Bush took a 120-mile bus tour through rural Illinois on
Wednesday, painting Dukakis as ``an inexperienced liberal'' out of
sync with Middle America.
   The Massachusetts governor, who has made much during the
campaign of his Greek immigrant parentage, targeted the same voters
during campaign stops Tuesday in Peoria and the Chicago area.
   Dukakis accused his GOP rival of threatening the Social Security
system, declaring that the issue in 1988 ``isn't just what will
paly in Peoria; the issue is what will work in Peoria.''

   A federal judge today found the FBI guilty
of discriminating against its Hispanic agents in promotions and
working conditions.
   Ruling in a lawsuit brought by most of the agency's Hispanic
agents, U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton said in a summary of his
opinion, ``This court has found a pattern of practice of
discrimination and condition of employment in promotional
opportunities as to the plaintiff's class.''
   However, Bunton did not find that the FBI had retaliated against
those involved in the lawsuit, according to the summary, attached
to his 97-page opinion.
   ``We're very elated,'' said Hugo Rodriguez, attorney for the
plaintiffs. ``We're very happy.''
   Chris Clark, an FBI attorney, had no immediate comment. The
decision will be forwarded to FBI headquarters and officials may
have a comment later, he said.
   Earlier, the director of a Hispanic group said he planned to ask
Congress to investigate the FBI regardless of the outcome of the
class action.
   The lawsuit was filed by El Paso agent Bernardo ``Matt'' Perez
and 310 other Hispanic agents, who contended the FBI discriminates
against them in promotion, discipline and assignments. They asked
for unspecified damages and changes in FBI policies.
   The FBI's 437 Hispanic agents comprise about 4.5 percent of the
9,574 agents; Hispanics make up about 8 percent of the general U.S.
population.
   Attorneys for Perez have said a favorable ruling could affect
FBI employment practices nationwide.
   During the two-week, non-jury trial in August, about 30 agents
testified that Hispanics are given less-desirable assignments, are
afforded less recognition for their successes and are not promoted
as quickly as non-Hispanic agents.
   Jose de Lara, national director of the League of United Latin
American Citizens, said this week he would ask for an investigation
into the FBI regardless of the decision.
   ``Either way, I will be calling on Congress to hold oversight
hearings on employment practices and attitudes, because obviously
something is wrong,'' de Lara said.
   He said he would ask Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, to launch the
investigation next year if he is appointed chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, as expected.
   De Lara added he would ask to meet with FBI Director William
Sessions, who was appointed after the suit was filed in January
1987. Before he was named FBI director in the summer of 1987,
Sessions was a federal judge in the western district of Texas and
one of Bunton's colleagues.

<TEXT>
   President Andrei A. Gromyko, the stone-faced
diplomat who served Kremlin leaders from Josef Stalin to Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, retired from the Politburo today in a move that likely
set the stage for his removal from the presidency.
   Gromyko's retirement came on the first day of a meeting of the
policy-making Communist Party Central Committee and one day before
a special session of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's nominal
parliament.
   His retirement from the president's post could clear the way for
Gorbachev to assume the presidency in a reorganization of Communist
Party and government functions.
   The shake-up in the Kremlin hierarchy virtually removed
holdovers appointed by Gorbachev's predecessors.
   There was initial confusion over Gromyko's status. In his speech
to the session, Gorbachev said Gromyko had requested he be allowed
to retire on pension, indicating he would step down from the
Politburo and the presidency.
   But it appeared that Gromyko could ask the party Central
Committee only to relieve him of his Politburo job. The question of
whether he will remain as head of state could be be taken up only
by the parliament at Saturday's meeting.
   Vadim A. Medvedev, Centrtal Committee spokesman, said Gromyko
had been thinking of retiring for some time, and asked to be
relieved of his duties.
   Gorbachev lauded the ``the merits and achievements'' of Gromyko,
who served as Soviet foreign minister for 27 years before becoming
president in July 1985.
   Tass, the Soviet news agency, said Gorbachev told the Central
Committee that Gromyko had submitted a request saying that at his
age ``the only sensible decision for me is to retire.''
   His statement said he wanted ``to go every day in the common
rank together with the entire party, with the entire people.''
   ``Generally speaking, it has been a rich political life,''
Gorbachev said. ``I would like to thank him ... for the great work
and faithful service for the party and the state, and to wish him
good health.''
   The 79-year-old Gromyko is a skillful and tough diplomat who
represented the Kremlin in negotiations with Western leaders from
Winston Churchill to President Jimmy Carter.
   He taught the West the meaning of the Russian word ``nyet''
during the Cold War but quickly accommodated himself to detente in
the 1970s and was considered a key supporter when Gorbachev assumed
the leadership of the Communist Party in 1985.
   Many have called him ``Grim Grom'' or ``Old Stoneface.'' He
outlasted Stalin, Nikita S. Khrushchev, Leonid I. Brezhnev, Yuri V.
Andropov and Kostantin U. Chernenko, all leaders of the Soviet
Union.
   His long tenure attests to a competence that enabled him to
survive the political upheavals in the Soviet Union.
   ``As a thoroughly professional practitioner of the diplomatic
trade, he has few peers in the modern world,'' Cyrus R. Vance, then
the U.S. secretary of state, said in 1978.
   Gromyko served as a loyal foreign minister to all Soviet
leaders, but during Andropov's leadership in 1982-84, Gromyko's
star rose. In March 1983, he became first deputy premier in
addition to his post as foreign minister and member of the
Politburo.
   Tass once said he took part in ``the most important foreign
political developments of our time.''
   Gromyko held some of his government's most demanding posts and
attended every U.S.-Soviet summit except the one in November 1985,
between Gorbachev and President Reagan. That was because he no
longer was foreign minister.
   Gromyko was named ambassador to the United States in 1943 at the
age of 34.
   He attended the conferences of the Allies in Tehran, Potsdam and
Yalta where Stalin, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime Minister
Winston Churchill of Britain and Chiang Kai-shek of China made
important wartime and postwar decisions.
   In 1946, Gromyko was named the Soviet Union's permament
representative to the United Nations, the world body he helped
found during his years in Washington.
   In his three years as a permanent representative on the U.N.
Security Council, Gromyko cast 26 vetoes, sounding out his ``nyet''
when it came his turn to vote.
   He gained the sobriquet ``Old Stoneface'' in 1960 when
Khrushchev raucously banged his shoe on his desk during a U.N.
General Assembly session, startling everyone in the hall _ except
Gromyko, who sat silently staring ahead.
   In June, a delegate to the Communist Party conference bluntly
criticized Gromyko and other longtime officeholders, suggesting
there was high-level support for removing them from office.

   ``It's the opening of squirrel season, and that's important in
rural areas,'' Secretary of State Fox McKeithen said. ``The LSU
(Louisiana State University) Tigers are on afternoon television
against the University of Florida, and in many areas of the state
there doesn't seem to be much interest.''
   The primary balloting will attract only about 38 to 42 percent
of the registered voters, the state's chief elections officer
predicted.
   McKeithen said he expected a higher turnout in the 4th
Congressional District, where incumbent Republican Rep. Jim McCrery
is being challenged by Adeline Roemer, the governor's mother, and
Robert Briggs, a retired military officer. Both challengers are
Democrats.
   McCrery won the seat in a special election last spring after
Roemer, the district's former congressman, took office as governor
on March 14.
   Under Louisiana's open primary system, all candidates run in the
same primary, regardless of party affiliation. If no candidate in a
race wins a majority Saturday, the top two contenders will meet in
a Nov. 8 runoff.
   McKeithen said more voter interest also is expected in the 8th
District, where incumbent Republican Rep. Clyde Holloway faces four
Democratic opponents, including Faye Williams, who he defeated in a
runoff two years ago, state Sen. J.E. Jumonville Jr., former Lt.
Gov. Bobby Freeman and former Alexandria Mayor John ``Tillie''
Snyder.
   Two of the state's eight House members delegation are unopposed:
Republican Richard Baker and Democrat Jimmy Hayes. The other
incumbents _ Democrats Jerry Huckaby, Lindy Boggs and Billy Tauzin
and Republican Bob Livingston _ were not expected to face serious
opposition.
   Voters also will judge one proposed amendment to the state
constitution, a tax break for owners who improve residential
property occupied by low- and moderate-income families. The
amendment would allow owners to pay taxes for five years based on
the pre-improvement assessed value.

   Communist Party and Soviet government bodies meet
this week in Moscow in sessions expected to result in changes to
the country's political system. Here, at a glance, is how political
power is apportioned in Soviet society:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE POLITBURO _ This 12-member group of top Communist Party
members is in fact the ruling body of the Soviet Union. Among its
members are Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the party's general secretary;
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and Yegor K. Ligachev, considered the No. 2 power at
the Kremlin. The Politburo customarily holds weekly closed-door
sessions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CENTRAL COMMITTEE _ The party's policy-making body is in theory
its top organ between party congresses, held every five years. The
300-member Central Committee assembles local party leaders,
high-ranking Moscow government and party officials, military and
KGB brass and other national figures. The Central Committee elects
the party's general secretary, the post held by Gorbachev since
March 1985, and the members of the Politburo.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SUPREME SOVIET _ By law the country's top law-making body, the
1,500-member parliament in reality does little more than give legal
force to decisions of the party leadership. Gorbachev wants a third
chamber of 750 deputies added to the bicameral Supreme Soviet, and
a more active national legislature of about 400 representatives
elected from among the enlarged body.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE COMMUNIST PARTY _ It is the sole Soviet party since the 1917
Russian Revolution. Gorbachev now wants to get its 20 million
members out of daily government and economic management, but has
served notice that rival political parties will not be tolerated.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Dismisses North Appeal of Pre-trial Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today dismissed an
attempt by Oliver L. North and two other Iran-Contra defendants to
scuttle charges they illegally diverted Iranian arms-sale proceeds
to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
rejected as premature the appeal of U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell's refusal to dismiss charges against North, a former White
House aide; ex-national security adviser John Poindexter, and arms
dealer Albert Hakim.
   The appeals court said it does not have the jurisdiction, until
the three defendants are tried, to consider claims that the
congressional testimony they gave under limited immunity from
prosecution had been illegally used against them.
   Such claims could be raised if the three defendants are
convicted and file appeals, the court said.
   The court also dismissed a petition by the defendants, who were
joined by the American Civil Liberties Union, asking that Gesell be
ordered to dismiss the charges or hold additional pre-trial
hearings on the immunity issue.
   North, Poindexter and Hakim had contended that the pervasive
publicity that resulted from their congressional testimony
inevitably ``tainted'' the grand jury that indicted them in March.
   The three, who were compelled to testify before the House and
Senate Iran-Contra committees under so-called ``use immunity,''
argued that, given the widespread publicity, their testimony was
inevitably used against them in violation of their constitutional
rights against self-incrimination.
   Under the law, the immunized testimony of a witness granted
``use immunity'' cannot be used against him as evidence.
   The three defendants asked the appeals court to order Gesell to
dismiss the indictment or to hold pre-trial hearings to more fully
explore whether grand jurors or witnesses before the secret panel
had been exposed to ``tainted'' evidence.
   Gesell refused to dismiss the indictment and held only
preliminary hearings on the issue of grand jury taint, saying the
matter could be taken up at post-trial hearings.
   The appeals court, in an unsigned opinion, said it could not
rule on the issues until after any convictions are appealed.
   The defendants ``have failed to demonstrated how the remedy
afforded by direct appeal will be `clearly inadequate' to correct
the perceived wrong,'' the appeals court said.
   ``If appellants are correct in their assertion of unfairly
prejudicial error, and those errors are properly preserved for
appeal, vacation of the judgment of conviction and dismissal of the
indictment will provide a full and fair remedy to appellants.'' the
court said.
   ``Appellants may ultimately be correct in their assertion that
if the grand jury's probable cause determination was `tainted' by
the use of immunized testimony, dismissal of the indictment will be
required to remedy the harm,'' said Circuit Judges James L.
Buckley, Douglas H. Ginsburg and David Sentelle.
   But the panel noted that the Supreme Court frowns on piecemeal
or so-called interlocutory appeals in the middle of a proceeding.
   ``Even when vindication of the defendants' rights requires
dismissal of the charge altogether, however, an interlocutory
appeal is not automatically justified,'' the court said.
   ``If the claimed error will not be important enough to warrant
correction on appeal from final judgment, it most assuredly is not
important enough to warrant the extraordinary step of an
interlocutory appeal,'' the court said.
   Gesell has ordered separate trials for North, Poindexter and
Hakim. A fourth defendant in the case, arms dealer Richard V.
Secord, testified on Capitol Hill without immunity from prosecution
and therefore was not part of the legal challenge. Secord will also
be tried separately.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has elected to try North
first, but the trial is not expected to begin until next year.
Gesell postponed the trial indefinitely to give prosecutors
additional time to process massive numbers of classified documents
that North may be entitled to use for his defense.
   In a statement following today's ruling, Walsh said: ``The Court
of Appeals decision is most welcome and permits us to concentrate
on pursuing the cases awaiting trial.''

   Two East Germans escaped uninjured
over their communist homeland's border fortifications to West
Germany Friday, authorities said.
   In the first escape, a 28-year-old crane driver fled over East
German border fortifications to Lower Saxony state in northern West
Germany, Hanover police said in a statement.
   The man entered West Germany near the border town of Osterode,
about 50 miles east of Hanover, said the statement.
   Later Friday, a 24-year-old East German man fled to the southern
state of Bavaria, police said.
   The man scaled frontier barriers apparently unnoticed by border
guards, Bavarian state police said.
   Police did not give further details and did not release the
men's names.
   Nearly 330 East Germans have escaped to West Germany or West
Berlin so far this year, according to federal statistics.

<HEAD>`We're Here for the Furniture,' Homeless Activists Tell Helms
Aides</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Homeless activists served a homemade
``eviction notice'' on the office of North Carolina Sen. Jesse
Helms on Friday, removed the furniture from his outer office and
were led off in handcuffs.
   ``Ooohhh, this chair feels good,'' chortled a homeless man
identified as Lou Juluke, 56, settling into a brown leather
upholstered, brass-studded chair in the middle of an upstairs hall
in the Dirksen Senate Office Building.
   Minutes later, a team of Capitol Hill civil disobedience
specialists in blue sleeveless sweaters, baseball-style caps and
disposable rubber gloves moved in and arrested three other
demonstrators who had removed the furniture.
   The demonstrators said Helms voted for budget cuts that left
thousands homeless and deserved a symbolic taste of his own
medicine. But there was no sign that the conservative lawmaker was
upset by the 30-minute episode.
   Helms' press secretary, Barbara Lukens, said she was unsure of
the whereabouts of the senator when the episode began. ``All I know
is that he's in his office now,'' she said. She was asked if he
would have anything to say about the matter.
   ``Has he ever issued many press statements?'' she asked.
   Those arrested identified themselves as Stewart Gurnsey, 37, of
Boston, a former Harvard divinity student and head of a nonprofit
housing company, and Jennifer Thompson, 22, and Jerry Jones, 21,
both originally from Chapel Hill, N.C., but now living in
Washington.
   Capitol Hill police spokesman Dan Nichols said they were charged
with unlawful entry and demonstrating in the Capitol. He said both
counts were misdemeanors punishable by $500 fines and six months in
jail. He said they would face arraignment Friday or Saturday in
D.C. Superior Court.
   All three said they were associated with Washington activist
Mitch Snyder whose fasting and feuding with the Reagan
administration over shelter for the homeless has captured the
national spotlight.
   A number of members of Snyder's Community for Creative
Nonviolence, including Juluke, looked on as the three demonstrators
were led away.
   The three activists arrived at Helms office at 11 a.m. and
served a ``notice of eviction'' that blasted the senator for
supporting budget cuts that have resulted in ``thousands of people
leading lives of quiet desperation'' in North Carolina ``on our
streets, in cars and abandoned tobacco barns.''
   Two receptionists said they were nonplussed as the three began
to pick up tables, chairs and potted plants and carry them into the
hallway.
   ``You better get somebody up here right away,'' said
receptionist Judity Jones into a telephone. Police began to arrive
a few minutes later.

   A brawl between five drunken people in a
village in western Tanzania near Lake Tanganyika set off a tribal
clash in which two people died, state-run Radio Tanzania reported.
   Twenty-six houses were set ablaze in the fight between members
of the Hembe and Waha tribes at Sunuka village near the western
town of Kigoma, according to the broadcast monitored in Nairobi on
Thursday.
   Police arrested 38 people after the Monday brawl and said they
were investigating the incident. They said two people were killed
and an unspecified number of others were injured.
   The Waha and the Hembe are two of the East African nation's 122
tribes.
   At least 5,000 people died in tribal massacres in August in
Burundi, a tiny nation northwest of Tanzania.

<HEAD>One Year After Violent Protests, China Maintains Firm Grip On
Tibet</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China's grip on Tibet appears firmer than ever
one year after long-suppressed hatred of Chinese rule erupted in a
violent protest that left at least 14 people dead.
   One year ago Saturday, about 2,000 Tibetans led by Buddhist
monks burned a police station in Lhasa, capital of the Himalayan
nation, and attacked police in the bloodiest uprising since an
abortive bid for independence in 1959.
   A second violent protest broke out at a Buddhist ceremony on
March 5, with 24 killed by unofficial count in day-long clashes
with police. Small peaceful protests, quickly ended by police, also
were held Sept. 26, Oct. 6 and several times since.
   But it was the violence of Oct. 1, China's National Day, that
brought the greatest international criticism of Communist China's
38-year rule in Tibet, including a condemnation by the U.S. Senate.
China appears determined to head off any commemoration.
   A few monks who tried to chant pro-independence slogans in
Lhasa's main square on Tuesday were quickly hustled away, and the
area was briefly closed to foreigners, Western travelers in Lhasa
reported. No other details were available.
   ``Nobody is allowed to use religious activities to disrupt
public order, damage people's health or disturb education,'' Mao
Rubai, vice chairman of the Tibetan regional government, said last
week in an interview with two foreign reporters.
   Religion and nationalism are inseparable in Tibet, which before
China's Red Army entered in 1950 was effectively ruled by Buddhist
monks headed by the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's holiest figure.
The independence protests have been led by monks demanding the
return of the Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959.
   Mao's two interviewers, from the U.S. Cable News Network and the
Sydney Morning Herald of Australia, were among the few foreign
journalists allowed to visit Tibet since the protests. Authorities
expelled from Lhasa 14 foreign reporters who were covering last
year's Oct. 1 protest, and since have barred dozens of journalists
from entering.
   Sketchy reports from Lhasa indicate the Chinese plan to be
prepared this year.
   An Asian diplomat based in Beijing, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said additional Chinese troops recently were posted to
the already heavily garrisoned region in what he said was
``obviously a law-and-order measure.''
   Western travelers in Lhasa, who also spoke anonymously, said
security forces have been posted at night in Buddhist monasteries
for the past few weeks to keep watch over the nationalist monks.
   They said an 11:30 p.m. Curfew took effect last Saturday for
foreign tourists, mostly restricted to group tours since the
protests.
   There were no signs that Tibetans planned any action on Oct. 1 _
only the usual whispers from monks and pilgrims in broken English:
``We hate Chinese. Dalai Lama come back.''
   In April, China invited the Dalai Lama to come back and live in
Tibet if he renounced independence for the region.
   Last week, China made a second overture, inviting the Dalai Lama
to hold a ``direct dialogue'' at the place of his choice. It still
insisted he renounce independence, and made no new concessions.
   The Dalai Lama agreed to talks. But the matter stalemated when
he said they should be based on his June proposal in Strasbourg,
France, that China give Tibet domestic autonomy while still
handling its foreign affairs and stationing troops there.
   China, unwilling to compromise on its 700-year-old claim to
sovereignty over Tibet, rejected the Strasbourg plan.
   China's latest overture appeared timed to assure Tibetans and
foreigners of its peaceful intentions before the Oct. 1
anniversary. But it also highlighted one result of the past year's
protests.
   The violence could not shake Chinese control. But it apparently
did convince Chinese leaders that real calm in Tibet cannot be
achieved without some kind of settlement with the man they long
denounced as a separatist.

<HEAD>Emperor Receives More Blood, Carter Visits Palace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors gave Emperor Hirohito blood for the eighth
straight day Friday as he continued to bleed internally. Former
President Jimmy Carter visited the Imperial Palace to wish the
monarch a speedy recovery.
   Doctors said the world's longest reigning living monarch was in
stable condition.
   Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, were among thousands of
well-wishers who braved a cold rain to visit the palace. Carter
signed his name in a registry but did not see the 87-year-old
emperor.
   The former president arrived in Japan Wednesday for a five-day
visit to attend the Japan Junior Chamber of Commerce's annual
convention.
   Hirohito has been under intensive care by a team of court
physicians since he vomited blood Sept. 19. Few people other than
family members have been allowed to see him.
   Since that day, the emperor has received more than eight pints
of blood, or more than two-thirds the normal amount of blood in his
body, news reports said.
   Doctors on Thursday began administering blood with the white
corpuscles removed. Such transfusions are aimed at preventing a
reaction to the white blood cells, Imperial Household Agency
spokesman Kenji Maeda said.
   ``The emperor remains in stable condition as a whole, though
slight traces of blood were detected Friday morning,'' Maeda told
palace reporters.
   Maeda said Hirohito's temperature was 99.7 degrees, compared
with his normal reading of 95.9 degrees.
   Gray skies and rain once again blanketed Tokyo, as they have
every day since the emperor's condition worsened, and Hirohito
asked a visitor what the weather was like in South Korea, where the
Olympics are being held, Maeda said.
   The imperial spokesman said the emperor also complained of
feeling hungry. He has not been able to eat or drink anything for
10 days, except for two small ice cubes Sept. 22, and is being fed
intravenously.
   Local news reports have said the emperor has intestinal cancer,
but palace officials have neither confirmed nor denied the reports.
They have urged the media to refrain from such speculation.
   Throughout Japan, organizers continued to cancel dozens of local
festivals, concerts and fall athletic meets because of the
emperor's illness, but government officials said such cancellations
should not be overdone.
   At the U.S. Air Force's Yokota Air Base, officials said they
were postponing the annual Japanese-American Friendship Festival
because of the emperor's health.
   ``The essence of the annual event is to express our friendship
for our Japanese hosts,'' Col. Richard T. Swope, 475th Air Base
Wing Commander, said in a statement. ``As an extension of that
friendship, we are postponing the festival until further notice.''
   But Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita urged that a national
athletic meet be held in Kyoto as scheduled, and sports officials
said each school should decide whether to hold sports events, news
reports said.
   Organizations opposed to the emperor system, such as the Japan
Communist Party, have criticized what they say is pressure on
groups to cancel normally scheduled events.
   Under Japan's postwar constitution, the emperor is a symbolic
head of state with little real power. His duties include placing an
official seal on documents and government appointments on the
advice of the Cabinet.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Greek-Americans who have
returned to their ``patrida'' _ or homeland _ are signing up for
absentee ballots, aided by an organization backing Democrat Michael
Dukakis for president.
   ``It's touching to see elderly people coming in fill out the
form. The oldest we had was a 101-year-old man who said he'd never
voted in a presidential election before,'' said Catherine
Carnatios, one 20 volunteers for the ``Friends of Michael Dukakis''
organization.
   Since the pro-Dukakis organization started up in August, more
than 20,000 Americans of Greek descent have filled out ballot
applications at 14 offices scattered around mainland Greece and the
islands, its members said.
   ``They're not looking to help elect a Greek president who'll
solve the problems of the `patrida' but they do have the idea of
the American dream coming true _ the son of immigrants becoming
president,'' Nikos Rezevoulis, the group's chairman, said in an
interview.
   The Massachusetts governor, whose parents both were born in
Greece, has stressed his immigrant background thorughout his
presidential campaign, earning approval from Greeks and Greek
Americans, even if they're not Democrats.
   ``Win or lose, Dukakis has given the Greek image a boost. He's
shown Greeks can be hardworking and efficient, which hasn't been
part of their image outside the United States,'' said Dimitris
Katsoudas, who heads a conservative think tank in Athens.
   Dukakis' candidacy has encouraged many older Greek Americans to
apply for ballots. Retirees make up at least one-third of an
estimated 75,000 American citizens living in Greece, according to
the Dukakis organization.
   The organization provides would-be voters with ballot forms and
volunteers help make sure they are correctly filled out.
   The forms also are available at the American Embassy, but Mrs.
Carnatios said ``people can be a bit shy about requesting
assistance from officials so they often prefer to ask us about the
details.''
   Other Greece-based voters are mostly students, and businessmen
and their families who divide their time between Greece and the
United States, and some are registered Republicans.
   ``I registered as a Republican back in the Sixties. But now I
want to vote for Dukakis, both for his policies and because I'm
proud of him,'' said Apollo Sakell, a 53-year-old former civil
servant from Leroy, New York.
   ``Mike Dukakis _ President'' bumper stickers can be seen around
residential districts of the capital where many Greek Americans
live, but Dukakis T-shirts and crockery haven't been selling well,
according to store clerks in downtown Athens.
   Such a lack of enthusiasm may reflect a reluctance among Greeks
to be seen backing a candidate who has been trailing in the polls.

   Protesters hurled firebombs into U.S.
army headquarters Friday in an escalating anti-American campaign,
U.S. and South Korean authorities said. No damage was reported.
   The attack followed an outburst of anti-U.S. sentiment spurred
by incidents involving American athletes and news media during the
Olympics. The Games, which began Sept. 17, end Sunday.
   Police and U.S. military authorities said a band of youths,
believed to be radical students, tossed firebombs over a wall into
a motor pool at the headquarters of the 8th U.S. Army near central
Seoul. Police said nine people involved in the attack fled.
   Newspapers and Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said the
attack involved at least 20 youths who threw at least four
firebombs from an elevated walkway and left 15 more behind.
   It was the second firebomb attack on U.S. armed forces'
facilities this year, a U.S. military spokesman said. A window was
broken in the first attack, the spokesman said without elaborating.
   President Roh Tae-woo and other top officials this week called
on South Koreans to stop criticizing the United States and to
remember the nations' close ties.
   In recent years, radical students have staged violent anti-U.S.
protests, and U.S. facilities, including American cultural centers,
have been the targets of occasional firebomb attacks.
   Radical students demand the withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact. They contend
U.S. forces enforce the division of the Korean peninsula with North
Korea.
   In southern Seoul, about 250 students marched off Kyongwon
University after an anti-U.S., anti-Olympic rally on Friday and
occupied a highway leading to a nearby Olympic stadium for field
hockey. Yonhap said the students dispersed voluntarily as their
protest caused traffic congestion for a half-hour.
   About 50 students with firebombs and clubs held an anti-U.S.
rally at Dongguk University in downtown Seoul. The campus was
tightly guarded by riot police, but there was no clash.
   Also Friday, a group of students delivered a letter to the U.S.
Embassy protesting the behavior of American athletes and
journalists during the Olympics.
   South Korean newspapers have atacked U.S. news media, especially
NBC-TV, for coverage of an attack by South Korean boxing officials
on a New Zealand referee who awarded a match against a local
favorite.
   But Roh has defended NBC's coverage, saying, ``Even if the
reports of NBC included something that hurt our self-esteem, we
should put up with it, since most of the network's reports were
affirmative.''
   Further criticism was provoked by the conduct of some U.S.
athletes said to have acted rudely at the Games' opening ceremony
and other events, and the arrest of two American swimmers for
stealing a lion's head ornament from a Seoul hotel.
   ``The incidents are clear evidence that Americans are slighting
the Korean people,'' the students' letter said.
   But the vehemently anti-communist officials, who initially
played a role in criticizing American behavior, also have become
alarmed with South Koreans who have shown a growing public interest
in the Soviet Union.
   Citizens seemed enraptured by their first encounter with Soviet
athletes and officials _ Soviet ballet and cultural offerings
during the Olympics sold out, Soviet goods disappeared in minutes
at stores and Soviet athletes were praised for their dignified
conduct.
   Government officials said it was hard to believe many South
Koreans would admire the Soviet Union, a long-hated enemy that shot
down a South Korean jetliner in 1983.

   Despite what the job listing says, the U.S.
Treasury is not looking for a magician, voodoo or otherwise, to
solve the budget deficit.
   The job bulletin from the University of Michigan announces the
federal government is in need of a ``magician, deficit'' who will
be paid between $20,000 and $40,000 and will be ``involved somehow
with financing the deficit.''
   The contact for job seekers, Norman Carlton, with Treasury's
Division of Domestic Finance, said the department's official notice
designates the open position as ``financial economist'' with either
a bachelor's degree or master's degree needed to qualify.
   Carlton, who had already received several phone calls about the
listing, said he had no idea how the wording got changed.
   ``It sounds like somebody's idea of a joke, but it wasn't our
idea of a joke,'' he said.

<HEAD>Goverment Says It Recaptured Rebel Posts, Killed 76 More People</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The army recaptured outposts along the
Chinese border from communist rebels and killed at least 76 people
in suppressing unrest elsewhere this week, a government spokeman
said Friday.
   By official count, at least 425 people have been killed since
hard-line Gen. Saw Maung seized power Sept. 18 and ordered troops
to put down demonstrators throughout the country.
   Three army outposts that fell to rebels of the outlawed Burma
Communist Party were recaptured Friday with support from air
strikes, government spokesman Kyaw Sann told a press conference.
   More than 1,500 insurgents on Sept. 23 attacked and occupied
positions at Lamingone, Yanshingone and Payagone near the Chinese
border about 340 miles northeast of Rangoon. In ensuing clashes at
least 131 rebels and 48 soldiers were killed and 104 wounded,
officials said.
   Kyaw Sann said mopping-up operations were continuing. The
communists are believed to have some 20,000 guerrillas under arms.
   The Communist Party earlier issued a statement supporting the
mass pro-democracy uprising in Burma that began in late July. But
it was not known whether the reported attacks were designed to
alleviate anti-government pressure.
   Also Friday, the leading opposition group denounced the military
government for threatening to punish striking workers and said
Burma's leaders were trying to ``destroy the movement for
democracy.''
   The government has ordered all civil servants and workers in
state-run factories to return to their jobs by Monday or face
dismissal. Most government employees have been on strike since Aug.
8, paralyzing the country's administrative and economic machinery.
   A press release from the National League for Democracy said the
general strike was ``the major force at the forefront of the
movement for democracy'' and urged all people to stay away from
work.
   ``Actions such as removal from service, eviction from official
residence, demotion and transfer of government servants for
continuing the general strike amount to opposing and denial of
democratic rights,'' the release said.
   A spokesperson for the Karen ethnic minority rebels said Friday
that nearly 2,000 students and others have fled to areas under
their control along the Thai border. Some of the escapees, who hope
to receive military training at Karen bases, claim to have seen
authorities executing students and other protesters.
   The Karen are among a dozen ethnic groups fighting for greater
autonomy from the central government. The Karens, who number about
2 million, first rose up against Rangoon in the late 1940s.
   The new government has promised multiparty general elections but
the National League for Democracy has yet to decide whether to
contest them.
   The league, headed by former army general Aung Gyi, has urged
that people continue to fight the autocratic system through
peaceful means. Two other political parties have emerged to oppose
the government which western diplomats say is squarely behind the
National Unity Party.
   This military-backed party, under its former name of the Burma
Socialist Program Party, has wielded control since strongman Ne Win
seized power in a 1962 military coup.
   The United Nations Children's Fund began a six-day airlift of
103 tons of emergency medical supplies for hospitals in Burma. A
chartered C-130 aircraft will shuttle between Bangkok, Thailand,
and the Burmese capital to deliver the supplies for 50 hospitals
and 23 dispensaries, a UNICEF release said.

<HEAD>Gromyko, Dobrynin Retire, New Politburo Members Named</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with quote from Gromyko, details on other
appointments.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Andrei A. Gromyko retired from the
ruling Politburo today in a major power shift on the first day of a
hastily called meeting of the policy-making Central Committee.
   Gromyko's retirement from the Politburo will likely set the
stage for his removal from the presidency, which could clear the
way for Mikhail S. Gorbachev to seek election to a new, more
powerful presidency.
   The move was followed by a series of personnel changes that mark
the largest shake-up in the ruling circle since Gorbachev became
party leader in 1985.
   The Central Committee appeared to demote Kremlin No. 2 leader
Yegor K. Ligachev, who was assigned responsibility for agricultural
policy in a reorganized committee apparatus.
   Ligachev had been responsible for party ideology and had been
seen as a principal conservative rival to Gorbachev. He retained
his Politburo job and will be responsible for policy in what
Gorbachev sees as a sector of the economy crucial to reforms, but
he likely will have less influence in the party.
   The changes were announced at the meeting, which was arranged on
short notice and required several top officials, including Foreign
Minister Eduarde A. Shevardnadze, to cut short foreign visits and
rush home.
   Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the longtime ambassador to Washington, was
sent into retirement from his post as Communist Party foreign
affairs secretary.
   KGB chief Viktor M. Chebrikov was named a secretary of the
Central Committee to go along with his Politburo status, and three
new alternate members of the Politburo were named, said Vadim A.
Medvedev, a committee spokesman.
   Mikhail S. Solomentsev, 75, also was retired from his positions
as a full member of the Politburo and head of the Party Control
Commission, Medvedev said.
   Gromyko and Solomentsev were holdovers from previous leaderships
that have been criticized under Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,''
or openness.
   Medvedev himself was elevated to full Politburo status, he said.
   Interior Minister Alexander V. Vlasov, the nation's top
policeman, was made an alternate member of the Politburo, as were
Alexandra Biryukova, the highest-ranking woman in the Soviet
hierarchy, and Anatoly Lukyanov, general department chief.
   The two alternate Politburo members who lost their posts were
Vladimir I. Dolgikh and Pyotr N. Demichev. Dolgikh was responsible
for the heavy industry sector of the economy, and Demichev had
served as Soviet vice president.
   The changes left only two Politburo members _ Vitaly Vorotnikov,
chief of the Russian republic and Vladimir Shcherbitsky, head of
the Ukraine _ as pre-Gorbachev appointees.
   There was initial confusion over Gromyko's status. Gorbachev in
his speech to the session said Gromyko had requested he be allowed
to retire on pension, indicating he would step down from the
Politburo and the presidency.
   But it appeared that Gromyko could only ask the party Central
Committee to relieve him of his Politburo job. The question of
whether he will remain as head of state could be only be taken up
by the parliament, which meets Saturday.
   Medvedev said Gromyko had been thinking of retiring for some
time.
   ``I feel sad over the fact that my position within the Communist
Party Central Committee has changed,'' Gromyko told the meeting.
``But age is a stubborn thing and there is no getting away from
it.''
   Gromyko, 79, was named president in July 1985 after serving a
succession of Soviet leaders as foreign minister for nearly 30
years. He was replaced as foreign minister by Eduard V.
Shevardnadze.
   Tass said earlier that the Central Committee meeting would
consider ``proposals on reorganization of the party apparatus in
the light of the decisions of the 19th Communist Party conference.''
   At that congress in June, the Soviet leader outlined a series of
political reforms. His blueprint calls for the creation of a
full-time, standing legislature and a more powerful presidency.
   The agriculture section now headed by Ligachev is one of six
departments in a newly reorganized Central Committee apparatus.
   Medvedev said the Central Committee apparatus would be
drastically reduced, perhaps by as much as half.
   Giorgy Razumovsky, a close Gorbachev protege, was assigned
responsibility for party workers. Medvedev, a political economist
by training, was given responsibility for ideology; Nikolai
Slyunkov was put in charge of social-economic questions; Alexander
Yakovlev was made chairman of a commission on international policy,
and Chebrikov, the KGB chief, was given responsibility for legal
policy.
   Razumovsky and Yakovlev are known to be very close advisers to
Gorbachev.
   Boris K. Pugo, the Communist Party chief of Latvia, was chosen
to replace Solomentsev as head of the Party Control Commission,
which reviews reports of misconduct by party officials.

   Unseasonably mild weather greeted
thousands of Mormon Church leaders and members gathering Friday for
the faith's 158th Semiannual General Conference.
   President Ezra Taft Benson was to be the keynote speaker at the
first of four general sessions Saturday morning, as well as to fill
a vacancy in the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
   The Twelve is an advisory body to the governing three-member
First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, headed by the 89-year-old Benson, a former U.S. agriculture
secretary.
   The vacancy was created May 20 at the death at age 90 of Marion
G. Romney, the quorum's president. He was replaced by the
next-most-senior member of the Twelve, Howard W. Hunter, next in
line to be church president.
   Vacancies in the all-male hierarchy usually are filled during
the general conferences held on the first weekends of April and
October.
   The two-day conference is held in the 6,000-seat Tabernacle on
Temple Square, but hundreds of thousands more will view the
sessions on television and over the church's satellite network. The
latter reaches more than 2,000 church centers in the United States,
Canada and Puerto Rico.
   The church has 6.5 million members and missionaries in 80
countries and 17 territories.

   The death toll from the crash at the
Ramstein air show disaster increased Friday to 68, and police
searched for a man posing as an orphan from the Aug. 28 crash in a
scheme to bilk the elderly.
   Juergen Dietzen, a spokesman for Rhineland-Palatinate state,
said a 36-year-old West German man died in a Kaiserslautern
hospital of injuries sustained in the tragedy at the Ramstein U.S.
Air Force base.
   Dietzen said 61 people remained hospitalized.
   The accident occurred when three Italian stunt planes collided
while performing at an annual air show. One jet crashed into the
crowd and exploded.
   Authorities said 60 West Germans, three Americans, one Dutch
citizen, one French citizen and the three Italian pilots died in
the disaster.
   Police in Cologne searched for a young man who asked several
elderly people for large sums of money after telling them he lost
his parents in the air show accident.
   Police said the man tried the scheme in Cologne, Dortmund and
Duesseldorf.
   An 83-year-old woman who heard the man's story but refused to
give him money later saw the man with another elderly woman at a
bank, authorities said.
   The second woman was about to withdraw several thousand marks
from her account to give to the man, police said.
   Police said the man fled after the first woman approached him.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest
retailer, will go after more affluent customers with a test program
to accept Visa and MasterCard at its stores, and plans to add
American Express next year.
   Beginning next week, customers at four stores in Richmond, Va.,
will be able to use their Visa and MasterCards at Sears, the
company announced Thursday.
   Another four stores _ Sears won't say where _ will be added to
the test program in November, an unidentified Sears spokesman told
the Chicago Sun-Times.
   After Jan. 1, Sears will add 12 Sears department stores and six
of its paint and hardware stores to the program, which by then will
include the American Express card, the spokesman said.
   For now, ``this isn't considered a national rollout of any kind.
We are still in discussions with these companies, and none of the
details have been completed,'' the spokesman said.
   Sears now accepts only two kinds of plastic in its 825 U.S.
stores: Sears' own card and the company's 2-year-old Discover card,
which also can be used in other stores.

<NOTE>Eds: Top 6 grafs new with GOP calling for investigation of Wright.
Editing throughout to conform.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican members of the House Intelligence
Committee said today they would ask the full House to vote to
investigate Speaker Jim Wright on charges that he improperly
disclosed a secret CIA operation in Nicaragua.
   The lawmakers said they had made that recommendation to House
Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., who had accepted it. They
said they were introducing a resolution calling for the Wright
investigation which could be voted on by the full House next week.
   Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., a member of the intelligence panel and
the No. 3 Republican leadership official, said the GOP had been
stymied by majority Democrats in seeking to start an investigation
through normal ethics and Intelligence Committee channels.
   ``Absolutely no action has been taken to date, and there appears
little prospect for action by the majority party,'' Cheney said at
a news conference.
   Joining Cheney in introducing the resolution were Reps. Henry
Hyde of Illinois, Bob Livingston of Louisiana, Bob McEwen of Ohio,
Dan Lungren of California and Bud Shuster of Pennsylvania.
   Cheney acknowledged that it would be difficult to pass the
resolution in the Democratic-controlled House, but said he believed
important institutional principles were at stake, including
cooperation with the executive branch on intelligence matters.
   The move promised to heighten partisan tensions over Wright's
problems with just a week left before Congress adjourns for the
campaign trail.
   ``The relationship between the parties is very strained,''
Cheney said, noting that verbal exchanges were reaching new highs
in bitterness.
   Cheney said Republicans, chafing for two years under what they
consider Wright's heavy-handed leadership style, had been
``energized'' by Wright's comments last week about a purported CIA
covert operation in Nicaragua, which they contend violated House
rules against disclosing secret information.
   The pressure over that issue was heightened when the
Intelligence Committee on Wednesday declined to turn over to the
ethics committee classified information relevant to a requested
investigation of Wright in the matter.
   Michel, who had requested the probe along with Cheney, asked GOP
members of the intelligence panel on Thursday to prepare a
confidential report for him recommending what should be done next.
   ``I've never seen this thing get out of control like it is
now,'' said Rep. Tony Coelho, the Democrats' No. 3 leadership
official in the chamber. Coelho accused GOP leaders of trying to
``tear down the institution'' and of caving in to right-wing
elements of their party who seek to embarrass Wright.
   Coelho, D-Calif., said the intelligence meeting was forced by
Republicans, who knew the panel would have to decline to release
the information.
   ``What you have now is an effort that's very political, very
aggressive and loaded with grenades,'' he said, attributing the
whole controversy to Republican frustration over being the minority
party in the House since 1956.
   ``The Republicans' problem in the House is that we don't take
them seriously, Republicans in the Senate don't take them seriously
and the White House doesn't take them seriously,'' Coelho added.
   ``I wonder what Tony's smoking?'' Cheney said when apprised of
the comments. ``The real problem is the speaker, and the way he
operates. ... He's trashed the CIA, damaged U.S. foreign policy in
Nicaragua. ... All of Tony Coelho's blue smoke and mirrors won't
change that.''
   Wright, D-Texas, said the effort to launch a probe into his
comments was a political move and again denied revealing classified
secrets when he spoke to reporters about what he termed the CIA's
attempts to instigate civil unrest in Nicaragua.
   ``It is really very sad that people will try to use the ethics
committee, or any other committee of the House, as a cat's paw to
try to carry out a partisan political vendetta against another
member,'' he said.
   But Republicans called the Democratic counteroffensive a dodge,
and said Wright simply was seeking to escape the consequences of
his mistake by stirring up a partisan smoke screen.
   And members in both parties saw Michel's participation in the
request for an investigation as a turning point in relations
between the parties in the chamber, because Michel has for years
taken a less confrontational stance in dealings with the majority.
   Some moderate Democrats were saying privately that while they
were proud of the legislative record of the 100th Congress under
Wright's leadership, they were uncomfortable with his highly
visible role in U.S. diplomacy toward Central America.
   Tensions between the two sides surfaced on the House floor
Thursday after one Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Pat Williams of
Montana, denounced GOP vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle for
``hypocrisy'' in campaign statements that didn't match his voting
record. Republican members bristled, and demanded that Williams be
ruled out of order.
   ``I think it's probably set the stage for a series of
fireworks,'' Williams said later. ``The members are at a boiling
point, not only because of the presidential campaign but also
because of the charges against the speaker.''

   Teen-agers with overactive imaginations
are to blame for rumors that a satanic cult is searching for a
blond, blue-eyed child for human sacrifice, a police official said
Friday.
   As the rumors flowed, more than three dozen children were kept
from the elementary school in Sissonville, a town of 400 people 20
miles to the northwest.
   ``Yesterday we had 52 students out,'' Wallace Heights Elementary
School Principal Freddie Keen said Friday. ``Today we're down to
43, and six of them, their parents called to say they are sick.''
   The rumors have spread into adjacent Putnam County, where the
sheriff's department reported receiving 50 calls Thursday from
worried parents. One school secretary said she had received
numerous calls from parents who wanted to make sure teachers are
present when students are on the playground or boarding buses.
   Police say they've found no evidence to support the stories, but
some parents say they've heard rumors a satanic cult has been
mutilating dogs and searching for a blond, blue-eyed child.
   ``I've heard them. The parents have heard them,'' Keen said.
   Kanawha County Sheriff's Department Capt. W.T. Markham said
local children are to blame for the rumors.
   ``We think a bunch of kids 13 and 14 years old got hold of a
bunch of books about Satan worship and cults and they're reading
these things and starting rumors, and they're getting a lot of
mileage out of these rumors,'' Markham said.
   Markham said officers have found no evidence of a cult, but that
doesn't satisfy some parents.
   ``I told that to one parent, and she said, `Yes, but you don't
have a blond-haired, blue-eyed child, do you?'' Markham said.
   Kanawha County Schools Superintendent Richard Trumble said
security at school has been beefed up, but Keen said some parents
still are afraid.
   ``There's no physical evidence,'' Keen said. ``There's a lot of
fear. There's a lot of fear in the whole county. The rumors have
been going on for weeks.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rebuffs Defense Bid to End Prosecution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Friday rebuffed an
attempt by Oliver L. North and two co-defendants to stop their
prosecution for diverting the proceeds of U.S.-Iran arms sales to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it
would only consider arguments that the defendants' congressional
testimony was illegally used against them after convictions in the
case.
   ``Except for a very limited number of cases ... appeals in
criminal cases must await the termination of the proceedings by
final judgment,'' said Circuit Judges James L. Buckley, Douglas H.
Ginsburg and David Sentelle.
   ``If appellants' claims may effectively be reviewed on appeal
from a final judgment of conviction, there is no justification for
departing from the general prohibition against piecemeal review,''
the court said of the defense challenge that was joined by the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   North, a former National Security Council aide; former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim
contended that because of widespread publicity, grand jurors and
witnesses were exposed to the congressional testimony the
defendants gave under limited immunity from prosecution.
   Prosecutors are barred from using the immunized testimony that a
witnesses gives Congress as evidence against that defendant in
court.
   While the court did not rule on the merits of the appeal, the
judges said the defendants' ``claim that the (congressional)
immunity affords them a right not to be prosecuted at all is
ill-founded.''
   The three defendants had appealed U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell's preliminary determination that prosecutors and grand
jurors had not relied on the immunized congressional testimony as
evidence to return the indictment.
   Gesell's decision to hold only a limited pre-trial hearing on
the issue of grand jury ``taint'' was also a subject to the
challenge.
   The appeals court also dismissed a request that it order Gesell
to either dismiss the indictment or hold a more extensive pre-trial
hearing on the immunity issue.
   Gesell had ruled that the question could be dealt with in
post-trial proceedings if any evidence of taint emerged during the
trials.
   The judge has ordered separate trials for North, Poindexter,
Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, a business
partner of Hakim who testified on Capitol Hill without limited
immunity.
   The defendants are accused of conspiring to defraud the U.S.
government by diverting proceeds from the arms-for-hostages deals
with Iran to the Contras at a time when Congress banned American
military aid to the rebels.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has elected to try North
first, but the case is not expected to go to trial until next year.
   Gesell has indefinitely postponed the case to give prosecutors
additional time to find and process a large number of classified
documents that North may be entitled to use in his defense.
   In a statement issued following Friday's decision, Walsh said:
``The Court of Appeals decision is most welcome and permits us to
concentrate on pursuing the cases awaiting trial.''
   At a pre-trial hearing last spring, Walsh documented elaborate
procedures to prevent members of his staff and grand jurors from
being exposed to the immunized congressional testimony of the
defendants.
   Walsh also filed evidence under seal in court to prove it was
not derived from information obtained by the House and Senate
Iran-Contra investigating committees.
   The appeals panel also rejected the defense contention that the
right not to be tried on ``tainted'' evidence must be invoked
before trial or it otherwise would not exist.
   The defendants ``have failed to demonstrate how the remedy
afforded by direct appeal will be `clearly inadequate' to correct
the perceived wrong,'' it said.
   ``Even when vindication of the defendants' rights requires
dismissal of the charge altogether, however, an interlocutory
appeal is not automatically justified,'' the court said of the
defense attempt to mount its legal challenge before the cases are
tried.
   The immunity issue also hinges on whether witnesses who
testified before the grand jury gave evidence in that proceeding
that was influenced what they learned from what North, Poindexter
or Hakim told Congress.

   Lloyd Bentsen today dismissed Republican
George Bush's stated commitments to education and a balanced
federal budget, and also got in a jibe at Bush's running mate.
   ``George Bush likes to talk about balanced budgets,'' Bentsen
said. ``It's like Dan Quayle talking about his resume. There's not
much to say.''
   Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said that
Michael Dukakis, his party's standardbearer, has balanced 10
consecutive Massachusetts budgets.
   ``That's the difference between promise and performance and
that's a difference we understand in the South,'' said Bentsen, a
senator from Texas.
   He also told the crowd of about 500 people that he and Dukakis
are committed to a strong national defense.
   The night before, in Dallas, Bentsen told fellow Texans that
Dukakis is more in tune with their concerns than Bush and declared
himself eager to debate his ``radical right'' counterpart on the
Republican ticket.
   At the fund-raiser, Bentsen joked about Bush's claim to be a
Texan. The vice president's legal residence is a Houston hotel
suite.
   ``I saw you check into the hotel and register,'' Bentsent told
Dukakis. ``In the minds of some, that makes you a Texan.''
   Jokes aside, Bentsen used strong partisan rhetoric in describing
the stakes of the November election in Texas and across the country
and of his debate next week with GOP vice presidential nominee
Quayle, who had campaigned in Texas the previous day.
   ``I don't have to tell you that the refusal of the Reagan-Bush
administration to develop themselves a national energy policy has
sentenced much of this state to a very deep and powerful
recession,'' the Texas senator told the $1.2 million fund-raiser.
   As for Quayle, Bentsen, who has spent much of this campaign trip
preparing for the debate, said he was ``looking forward to
discussing the issues with Dan Quayle because I think his radical
right agenda is out of the mainstream of America and I think
Americans think that.''
   ``He doesn't even know what century he lives in,'' Bentsen said
in a poke at a recent gaffe by Quayle, who said he had not lived in
this century. ``And believe me, if they get their way, we'll be
living in the 19th century and not the 20th century.''
   Dukakis, in his remarks, encouraged Bentsen to confront Quayle
on the issues and called the Indiana senator ``what's-his-name.''
   Bentsen attacked Bush and other Republicans for questioning the
patriotism of Dukakis _ whom he introduced as a ``patriot from
Massachusetts'' _ saying that the Pledge of Allegiance belongs to
all Americans and that the Democratic ticket had an extra pledge of
its own.
   ``We won't allow America to be kicked around by countries more
than happy to play us for the loser,'' Bentsen said. ``We won't let
this nation wonder what on earth is going on behind closed doors in
Washington. ... No crazy deals cooked up in the White House
basement. No falling asleep at the switch while second-level aides
run that show.''
   That comment appeared to be a direct attack of President Reagan,
something both Dukakis and Bentsen have for the most part avoided
throughout the campaign.
   Earlier, joining Dukakis to accept the endorsement of Texas'
largest police organization, Bentsen portrayed Dukakis as a proven
crimefighter who has cut crime and drug use in his state and a
leader who would provide action instead of Republican ``words and
rhetoric.''
   He also hailed the successful launch of the space shuttle
Discovery as a sign that the United States was ready to reclaim its
leadership in space and technology.
   ``Watch out Russia .. we're going to take that leadership
away,'' he said. Bentsen watched the launch on television in
Tennessee before flying to Texas on Thursday morning.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan said today there is no truth to
a report published in Israel that the United States has negotiated
successfully with Iran to gain the freedom of eight Americans and
one Briton held hostage in Lebanon.
   ``We are not negotiating directly with Iran. We have not talked
to the kidnappers,'' Reagan said shortly after arriving here on a
political trip.
   ``I think maybe Iran is putting these stories out,'' he added.
   The report, in the month-old Israeli weekly The Nation, said
that in exchange for the releases, beginning in about a week,
Washington will provide economic aid, gradually release billions of
dollars in Iranian funds frozen in U.S. banks and resume diplomatic
relations with Tehran.
   The newspaper, quoting unnamed sources, said the United States
and Iran had been negotiating directly on the matter since Monday
in Geneva. The hostages are believed to be held by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslems.
   Flying here from Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters on Air Force One:
   ``There have been no face-to-face negotiations. There have
always been third-party contacts, but there have been no talks that
we directed or we participated in. ...
   ``The problem is, I cannot account for other people who may have
been talking to Iran ... (but) in the sense of the word (that) we
asked somebody (to talk for the United States), the answer is no.''
   The spokesman said that ``there is no one authorized to make a
deal for hostages or do anything that is contrary to our policy.
... We're always ready to talk at authorized levels. We make no
deals.''

<HEAD>Pinochet Asks Forgiveness For Any Wrong Actions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Gen. Augusto Pinochet, seeking
voter ratification of a new eight-year term, asked Chileans to
forgive him ``if I've done something wrong'' since he seized power
in 1973.
   In an interview televised nationwide on all channels, Pinochet
on Thursday night urged voters to ``think of Chile'' when they go
to the polls Oct. 5 to vote in a referendum on his presidency.
   At the conclusion of the 15-minute appearance he said: ``If I've
done something wrong, forgive me. But I think that, overall, I have
more in my favor than against me.''
   The 72-year-old army commander rarely admits to wrong actions,
and is more prone to laud the accomplishments of his right-wing,
authoritarian government in public speeches and appearances.
   But most opinion polls show him lagging behind the opposition in
voter support, and the admission appeared an attempt to win the
backing of moderate voters offended by his harsh rule. His
government repeatedly has been criticized by local and
international organizations for human rights abuse and restricting
civil liberties.
   In the referendum, Chileans will vote yes or no on a proposal by
the country's military commanders that Pinochet remain president
until 1997.
   If most vote yes, he will assume a new eight-year term in March.
If the majority vote no, an open election will be called next year,
and Pinochet will hand over power to the winner in March 1990.
   The interview appeared during 15 minutes of free television time
that pro-government forces receive nightly. A coalition of 16
opposition parties, ranging from the center-right to socialist,
also receives 15 minutes nightly.
   On Sept. 11, 1973, Pinochet toppled elected President Salvador
Allende, a Marxist. Allende died in the coup.

<HEAD>Economic Forecasting Index Posts Moderate Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's chief forecasting gauge of
future economic activity rose a moderate 0.4 percent in August,
suggesting to analysts that growth will continue through next year,
but at a slower pace.
   The gain reported Friday in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators follows a 0.6 percent drop in July and
a 1.5 percent jump in June.
   ``I think the index is telling us that ... we ought to get
through 1989 without a recession,'' said Cynthia Latta, an
economist with Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ``I think it
also tells us, if you look at the last few months together, that
the economy will be growing more slowly by next year.''
   The index is intended to predict economic activity six to nine
months in advance, but analysts caution against drawing firm
conclusions until a clear pattern is established over three months.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said new
single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
713,000 units in August, up 0.1 percent from July and the same as
in June.
   It was the best three-month performance since February-April
1987, when long-term mortgage rates dipped below 9 percent and
spurred a housing sales boom.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday's reports
were ``good news for the economy'' and ``suggest continued economic
growth.''
   Most economists agree that growth, as measured by the gross
national product, will slow from the robust 3.2 percent annual pace
of the first half of this year.
   They differ, however, over how much and how soon. The Federal
Reserve Board, which has been pushing up interest rates since late
March in an effort to curb inflationary pressures, believes a 2
percent to 2.5 percent growth rate is sustainable without inflation.
   An increase in unemployment in August coupled with lackluster
retail sales and sluggish growth in personal income all pointed to
a welcome cooling. However, a big increase in orders of
manufactured goods and now the leading index indicate that August
may represent, at best, a pause in growth.
   ``I think this concern that seemed to be developing from a lot
of the early August data that the expansion was running out of gas
was somewhat premature,'' said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist
for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   ``It was only a moderate increase, but ... we've reached a point
that if the indicators are very strong, we'd be sitting here
chewing our nails, worrying about inflation. ... The fact that
these (indicators) are not moving up strongly is probably
favorable,'' he said.
   Dederick said the economy likely has not slowed enough to
satisfy the Fed, which he said probably would nudge interest rates
higher late this year or early next year.
   Five of the available nine components of the leading index
contributed to the increase in August, while four detracted from it.
   The biggest boosts came from a drop in average weekly claims for
state unemployment benefits, from 325,000 in July to 298,000. A
rise in orders for manufactured consumer goods, from $85.2 billion
to $89.3 billion last month, also was a big plus.
   Together, these two categories accounted for two-thirds of the
positive activity. Also adding to the overall increase were rises
in plant and equipment orders, in building permits and in the price
of raw materials, which is read as a sign of strong demand.
   Indicators making a negative contribution, in order of severity,
were a decrease in business delivery times, read as an indication
of slackening demand; a drop in the average workweek; a decline in
the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks and a contraction of the
money supply in inflation-adjusted dollars.
   The 0.4 percent overall increase left the index at 193.4 percent
of its 1967 base of 100.
   The leading index, since its creation in 1948, has correctly
predicted all eight recessions. However, it also has falsely
predicted a recession four times.
   The index last declined for three consecutive months from June
through August 1984. The economic expansion slowed, but there was
no contraction.
   Also, preliminary estimates of the index are often revised
substantially in later months. For instance, declines were
initially reported for five straight months _ from September 1987
through last January. Later revisions wiped out all but two of the
drops, in November and January.

   An explosion in a chemical research
lab Thursday killed four scientists and seriously injured another,
company officials said.
   Six people were in the lab of CIL Inc. when the explosion
occurred shortly after 9 a.m. CIL manfuctures explosives and
produces chemicals used in the forestry, agriculture and plastics
industries.
   The scientists were doing experiments on emulsion explosives,
which are used in mining and construction, said Dr. Michael
Wenkoff, director of the CIL Explosives and Technical Center, part
of a large CIL explosives research and manufacturing complex about
20 miles east of Montreal.
   ``There was an accidental explosion without any fire or fumes,''
said Wenkoff.
   He said there was no hazard to surrounding buildings. The
explosion was confined to a small building, and there were no signs
of damage outside.
   ``These people were very familiar with the chemicals and their
dangers,'' said Yvan Toupin, director of operations for CIL, who
said the cause of the accident has not been determined.
   Margaret Simpson, who lives behind the building said she was
home all morning but didn't hear the explosion.
   ``But there have been umpteen explosions,'' she said.
   The last serious accident at the plant was on Oct. 1, 1975, when
eight people were killed in an explosion.

Skirmish</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian and Druse forces agreed to a
cease-fire Friday after a five-hour skirmish, and rival Moslem and
Christian cabinets sought to defuse tensions in separate meetings.
   Police said six people were wounded when pro-Syrian militiamen
of the Druse, a mystical offshoot of Islam, and soldiers loyal to
Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun battled with mortars and
machine guns.
   It was not known which side provoked the clash in the mountain
resort of Souk el-Gharb, seven miles southeast of the Lebanese
capital, police said.
   The cease-fire was arranged by a security committee that
included representatives of the army and the principal militias,
said a police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   An informal cease-fire halted fighting in the Christian-Moslem
civil war in 1986. But the threat of formal partition rose last
week after separate cabinets claimed power last week.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, heads the Christian cabinet. He was
appointed prime minister by President Amin Gemayel on Sept. 22,
minutes before Gemayel's six-year term ended.
   Moslems rejected the appointment, insisting the legal cabinet is
that of Salim Hoss, acting prime minister under Gemayel. Hoss is a
Sunni Moslem.
   Under an unwritten covenant that dates to Lebanon's independence
from France in 1943, the president must be a Maronite, the prime
minister a Sunni and Parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   On Friday, the Moslem cabinet decided to promote army and police
officers, a move that was adopted by Aoun's Christian cabinet in
its first meeting Tuesday.
   Aoun's three-man cabinet also met Friday. It decided to ensure
supplies of ``bread, flour, fuel and butane ... in east and west
Beirut as well as throughout Lebanon,'' Aoun told reporters after
the meeting.
   Hoss' cabinet also adopted a similar decision.
   Aoun's cabinet reminded government employees and other civil
servants to follow only ``the instructions issued by the
constitutional cabinet'' which was appointed by former President
Amin Gemayel Sept. 22, minutes before he ended his six-year term.
   The two cabinets said their decisions on promoting army and
police officers must be referred to Lebanon's 76-man Parliament for
ratification.
   The dual cabinets have separately noted that their main goal is
to speed up the election of a president to rule the war-torn nation.
   By Sept. 23, Parliament had failed three times in five weeks to
convene and elect a successor to Gemayel. House Speaker Hussein
Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, has indefinitely postponed the election
session.
   A boycott by Christian Parliament members prevented it from
attaining the 51-member quorum needed to vote for a new president.
   The boycott reflected opposition to the candidacy of
Syrian-backed Suleiman Franjieh and Mikhail Daher. The Christians
charged Franjieh and Daher would change Lebanon into a Syrian
satellite.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon. It has 40,000 troops
in eastern and northern provinces as well as in west and south
Beirut.

   Here, at a glance, is how political power is
apportioned in Soviet society:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE POLITBURO _ This 12-member group of top Communist Party
members is in fact the ruling body of the Soviet Union. Among its
members are Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the party's general secretary;
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze. The Politburo customarily holds weekly closed-door
sessions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CENTRAL COMMITTEE _ The party's policy-making body is in theory
its top organ between party congresses, held every five years. The
300-member Central Committee assembles local party leaders,
high-ranking Moscow government and party officials, military and
KGB brass and other national figures. The Central Committee elects
the party's general secretary, the post held by Gorbachev since
March 1985, and the members of the Politburo.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SUPREME SOVIET _ By law the country's top law-making body, the
1,500-member parliament in reality does little more than give legal
force to decisions of the party leadership. Gorbachev wants a third
chamber of 750 deputies added to the bicameral Supreme Soviet, and

   Sales of new single-family homes, bolstered by
a surge in the Midwest, rose slightly in August to continue the
strongest sales pace since early 1987, the government said Friday.
   The Commerce Department said sales inched up 0.1 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 713,000 units last month, 1,000
more sales than in July and the same as in June.
   It was the strongest three-month pace since February-April 1987,
when sales were booming because fixed-rate mortgages had fallen to
a low for the decade of between 8.5 percent and 9 percent.
   The strength this summer has surprised many analysts, who
expected sales to taper off as the Federal Reserve Board nudged up
interest rates to fight inflation.
   Fixed-rate mortgages dipped below 10 percent in February and
March, climbed to nearly 10.75 percent in August and have since
eased back to about 10.5 percent.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said fixed-rate mortgages,
not including add-on fees known as points, averaged 10.42 percent
this week, up from 10.40 percent last week.
   ``I think there's a sort of beat-the-clock behavior going on
among consumers,'' said Richard W. Peach, deputy chief economist of
the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. ``People were trying
to get into the market before rates get too far out of line.''
   David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of
Home Builders, said builders in surveys report brisk sales in early
September. He said the fundamental strength of the economy and the
availability of lower-priced adjustable-rate mortgages have helped
prop up sales.
   However, he predicted the Fed will again push interest rates
higher after the election and new-home sales will fall.
   By region, sales rose 10.9 percent in the Midwest to an annual
sales pace of 102,000 units. They were up 1.9 percent in the
Northeast to 107,000 units and up 0.3 percent to 287,000 units in
the South.
   A 5.2 percent drop in the West to 217,000 units almost offset
the gains in other regions.
   John A. Tuccillo, chief economist of the National Association of
Realtors, said sales are recovering in the Midwest with the
export-driven resurgence of manufacturing firms there, while sales
have been hurt in the West and Northeast by high prices.
   The median price of new homes fell 6.7 percent in August to
$112,000, meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less.
That followed an identical decline in July. However, the average
home price rose 2.0 percent to $145,200 in August following a 4.2
percent rise in July.
   The combination of a drop in the median price and rise in the
average price likely means more new homes of very high prices are
being sold, skewing the average.
   Contractors, squeezed by high land prices, are apparently
attempting to sell to affluent purchasers looking to trade up,
rather than to first-time home buyers.
   For the first eight months of 1988, new-home sales were 1.4
percent lower than the same period a year earlier, less of a
dropoff than was anticipated at the beginning of the year.
   Peach said he now expects new-home sales to total 675,000 this
year, up slightly from 671,000 last year but well below the peak of
750,000 units hit in 1986.

   Sam Ketcham seems more puzzled than hurt
when he talks about his abrupt ouster from the upscale Atlanta
shopping mall where he had performed his organ grinder act with a
monkey for three decades.
   Ketcham, known around Atlanta as The Monkey Man, can be found
these days in short stints such as the North Georgia State Fair.
   He was doing a brisk business Thursday night while his
39-year-old monkey, Willie, dressed in a flowered suit and cowboy
hat, collected mostly nickels and pennies from children at the fair.
   At Lenox Square, the mall where he worked since 1959, he said he
and his son, also an organ grinder, could pull in a couple hundred
dollars in a good week.
   But he was told this summer he no longer fits the image of Lenox
Square and could not perform there after July 19.
   ``All of a sudden, I got a letter saying I can't come back,'' he
said.
   Ketcham, 72, is among a vanishing breed, doing an act associated
with simpler times in a city that strains to be a model for the
future.
   ``Everybody gets a kick out of it,'' Ketcham said, nodding at
the kids. ``See how they go? They go crazy over the monkey.''
   When Willie needed a rest, Ketcham locked the animal in a
compartment in the back of his cart, and mused about how hiing card, you
know,'' he said.
   And besides, he added, ``I spent a lot of money there over the
years.''

   Even while Discovery is in orbit,
workers at the Kennedy Space Center are readying the next space
shuttle for launch in mid-November.
   Within hours of liftoff Thursday morning, NASA workers were
inspecting the launchpad and continuing with preparations to put
the shuttle Atlantis into orbit to deploy a secret military payload.
   ``We're ready to do another one,'' said NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone.
   Atlantis is scheduled to be launched no earlier than Nov. 17.
Since it is a Defense Department mission, information about the
payload and work that will be performed during the flight is
classified, she said.
   Unlike the Discovery flight, which has been bathed in attention
as the mission that returned America to space after a 2{-year
drought, the Atlantis flight will be very low-key, she said.
   NASA won't even make the countdown public until nine minutes
before launch. NASA makes a brief announcement when the spacecraft
reaches orbit, and every 24 hours NASA reconfirms that the flight
is continuing and the astronauts are healthy. Twelve hours' notice
is given for landing.
   Discovery is scheduled to land Monday morning at Edwards Air
Force Base in California. About 300 Kennedy Space Center engineers
and technicians will be there to prepare the spacecraft for its
flight back to Florida.
   ``We'll be out there about a week and while we're there, we're
going to be slower here at Kennedy. When we get them all back here,
our priority will be Atlantis,'' Malone said.
   About four miles from the pad, Atlantis is being prepared for
attachment to its external fuel tank, the huge orange cylinder that
feeds the shuttle's engines as it rides into space.
   The two booster rockers, which will power the shuttle off the
pad and through the first part of its trip into orbit, have already
been attached to the sides of the fuel tank.
   The shuttle could be ready to be transported to the pad Oct. 21,
Malone said.
   Atlantis will be perched on the same spot where Discovery stood,
and a damage assessment team reported little damage to the pad and
support structure from the force and heat of its sister ship's
takeoff.
   ``The condition of the pad is excellent,'' said Larry Schultz,
NASA's chief of launch structures. ``There's some normal fix-up
painting kind of thing that's got to be done.''
   Schultz said no design changes are necessary to the pad, which
has been used for only one other shuttle launch _ the tragic
Challenger flight that ended 73 seconds after liftoff in an
explosion.
   ``We've gotten pretty good'' at limiting damage to the launchpad
and maximizing its reuse, he said. ``We have 25 launches under out
belt.''
   ``There were no surprises on this one,'' he said.
   After Atlantis, Discovery is set for another mission in January,
the first of seven scheduled of 1989.

   Helene's winds dipped below hurricane strength
Friday as it lost its tropical characteristics, evolving as
expected into a 600-mile-wide storm in the far North Atlantic.
   ``We like to call them `extratropical.' The whole deal is, in a
hurricane the maximum winds are concentrated in a small area near
the eye. In extratropicals, the winds are spread out over hundreds
of miles,'' said National Hurricane Center expert Max Mayfield.
   At noon EDT Friday, Helene was centered about 460 miles
south-southwest of Reykjavik, Iceland. Top sustained winds were
about 70 mph as the storm moved north-northeast near 45 mph.
   In tropical systems, fierce winds revolve around warm cores of
low pressures. In Helene's case, ``it's becoming cold-core,''
Mayfield said.
   ``Eventually, it'll lose strength and that'll be the last of
it,'' he said, adding that the hurricane center would no longer
monitor the storm. ``It's getting (so far north) we can't even see
it on the satellite.''
   Meanwhile, the 16th tropical depression of the 1988 Atlantic
hurricane season was about 335 miles east-southeast of Barbados at
noon, moving northwest at 10 to 15 mph. Forecasters said it might
strengthen.
   The poorly organized depression's top winds were 35 mph, and it
was expected to drench the Windward Islands late Friday.
   Depressions receive named tropical storm status when winds hit
39 mph, and become hurricanes when winds reach 74 mph.
   Helene, the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic season, was born
last week near the Cape Verde Islands off west Africa. It's winds
peaked with 140 mph before the storm veered north and lost steam.
   The six-month hurricane season started June 1 and ends Nov. 30.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev retired President Andrei A.
Gromyko from the Politburo and fired other top leaders Friday in a
quick-paced Kremlin shake-up that brought Gorbachev closer to
assuming a new, more powerful presidency.
   An extraordinary meeting of the Communist Party Central
Committee made the biggest changes in the Soviet hierarchy since
Gorbachev became party general secretary in 1985. Top party ranks
were virtually stripped of appointees made by his predecessors.
   Kremlin No. 2 Yegor K. Ligachev, named party chief for
agriculture in a streamlined committee apparatus, apparently was
demoted in the meeting, which lasted only one hour.
   Ligachev, a member of the 12-man ruling Politburo who earlier
was replaced as party chief for ideology, was widely seen as a
potential conservative rival to Gorbachev.
   The party's top job in agriculture, once held by Gorbachev
himself, is key under the Communist Party chief's ambitious plan
for economic reform. But it carries far less prestige than the
portfolio for ideology, the post customarily held by the party's
No. 2.
   The 300-member policy-making Central Committee also named Vadim
A. Medvedev a full Politburo member and gave him responsibility for
ideology.
   Medvedev told reporters afterward that Mikhail S. Solomentsev,
75, also was retired from the Politburo.
   The retirement of the 79-year-old Gromyko from the Politburo set
the stage for his removal as president during a special session of
the Supreme Soviet legislature scheduled for Saturday in the
Kremlin.
   ``He is still the president for today,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters at the United Nations
in New York. ``But tomorrow the Supreme Soviet will be convened to
decide'' on the presidency, Gerasimov added.
   Gromyko's retirement would clear the way for Gorbachev to seek
election himself to a new, more powerful presidency that he has
advocated. The more powerful post would include responsibility for
defense, foreign affairs, and formation of the government.
   This week's Central Committee meeting and the parliament session
were called in haste, indicating Gorbachev may have decided to act
before opposition to the personnel changes could gel. The meetings
brought officials like Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and
Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov scurrying back to Moscow from
trips abroad.
   At the meeting, Gorbachev lauded ``the merits and achievements''
of the dour-faced Gromyko, indicating he was leaving in good
standing. Gromyko served as Soviet foreign minister for 27 years
before becoming president in July 1985.
   ``I feel sad over the fact that my position within the Communist
Party Central Committee has changed,'' Gromyko told the meeting.
``But age is a stubborn thing and there is no getting away from
it.''
   Gorbachev said: ``Generally speaking, it has been a rich
political life. Today when Andrei Gromyko is retiring I would like
to thank him on behalf of my colleagues in the Political Bureau,
and I hope the participants in the plenum think the same, for the
good work and faithful service for the party and the state, and to
wish him good health.''
   The remarks by Gorbachev and Gromyko were reported by the
official Tass news agency.
   Two alternate members of the Politburo also lost their posts:
Vladimir I. Dolgikh and Pyotr N. Demichev.
   Dolgikh, 63, and retiring Politburo member Solomentsev were
considered experts in heavy industry, and their retirement may
indicate dissatisfaction with efforts to increase efficiency in
that key area of the economy.
   Demichev, 70, has served as Soviet vice president, but he could
lose that job at Saturday's Supreme Soviet session.
   Removal of those officials left only two pre-Gorbachev
appointees on the Politburo: Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, chief of the
Russian Republic; and Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, head of the
Ukraine. The ruling body dropped from 13 to 12 members.
   One official brought to Moscow by Gorbachev, Anatoly F.
Dobrynin, former ambassador to the United States, also retired as a
secretary of the party Central Committee.
   The plenum also named KGB chief Viktor M. Chebrikov a secretary
of the Central Committee to go along with his Politburo status.
   Alexandra P. Biryukova, the highest-ranking woman in the Soviet
hierarchy, gained an alternate, or non-voting, Politburo spot, as
did Anatoly I. Lukyanov and Interior Minister Alexander V. Vlasov,
the nation's top policeman.
   Ms. Biryukova, who was responsible for the consumer sector,
becomes the first woman named to the Politburo since Culture
Minister Yekaterina Furtseva was a full voting member from 1957 to
1961 under Nikita S. Khrushchev.
   Medvedev, 59, a political economist by training, told a news
conference that in line with decisions at the meeting, the Central
Committee apparatus will be drastically reduced, perhaps by as much
as half.
   The agriculture section now headed by Ligachev is one of six
departments in a newly reorganized Central Committee apparatus.
   Georgy Razumovsky, a close Gorbachev protege, was assigned
responsibility for party workers, Nikolai Slyunkov was put in
charge of social-economic questions, Alexander Yakovlev was made
chairman of a commission on international policy, and Chebrikov was
given responsibility for legal policy.
   Boris K. Pugo, Communist Party chief for Latvia, was chosen to
replace Solomentsev as head of the Party Control Commission, which
reviews reports of misconduct by party officials.
   Ivan V. Kapitonov, the 73-year-old head of the party's Central
Auditing Commission, also was retired.

   West Germany appointed an ambassador
to Libya for the first time since the 1986 bombing of a Berlin
disco that U.S. officials blamed on the north African nation, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday.
   ``We see in Libya positive changes, politically and economically
and in terms of foreign policy,'' said the spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   He cited as one example Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi's
decision to release prisoners from the fighting with neighboring
Chad, as well as unspecified ``internal reforms.''
   The April 5, 1986, attack on West Berlin's popular La Belle
disco killed two U.S. military personnel and a Turkish woman and
injured about 230 other people.
   Citing what it said was proof of Libyan involvement in the La
Belle attack, the United States bombed the Libyan cities of Tripoli
and Benghazi 10 days later in retaliation.
   That May, the last West German ambassador left Tripoli the end
of his three-year tour and was not replaced due to the controversy
over the La Belle bombing, the spokesman said.
   But since then, West Berlin authorities have said they have no
concrete indications that Libya was involved. Some West Berlin
officials have said they suspect Syria may have been behind the
disco attack.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman said Juergen Hellner, who speaks
fluent Arabic, will be sent to Libya next month as the new
ambassador. A standard West German biographical reference book,
``Wer Ist Wer?'' said that Hellner served as the deputy chief of
West Germany's diplomatic mission in Syria in the early 1970s.
   The spokesman said there was ``no connection'' between the
appointment and the still inconclusive Berlin probe.
   ``We simply decided that we would have a better diplomatic
presence by being represented by an ambassador,'' the spokesman
said.
   Asked specifically whether Bonn officials believe Gadhafi has
backed off from a worldwide terrorism campaign, the spokesman said:
``If you take Gadhafi at his word, there has been a change. We hope
that has changed for the better, but we will have to wait and see.''
   But the top U.S. counter-terrorism official said in Washington
this week that Libya is supporting a renewed terrorist campaign led
by Palestine-born Abu Nidal.
   Ambassador-at-large L. Paul Bremer also told reporters that
Libya is using surrogates such as the Japanese Red Army in the
terror campaign. The United States has no diplomatic ties to Libya.
   West Germany will rejoin West European nations such as Spain,
France, Denmark, Greece and Italy that have ambassadors to Libya.
Italy is Libya's largest trading partner.
   Libya is West Germany's No. 2 oil supplier, behind Britain.
   Britain broke diplomatic relations with Gadhafi's government in
1984 after a London policewoman was shot to death during a protest
against the radical leader outside the Libyan Embassy in London.
   Since the departure of the previous ambassador, West Germany has
been represented in Libya by a charge d'affaires.

   Here are major provisions in the five-year,
$3.3 billion welfare overhaul legislation that cleared Congress on
Friday.
   _Welfare parents with children over 3 would have to participate
in a new Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) program offering
education, training and work activities ranging from high school to
community jobs.
   _States would have to concentrate available resources on the
toughest cases _ young parents without a high school education,
long-term recipients and families with older children who are
expected to lose eligibility.
   _JOBS participants would receive transportation and child care
help. Welfare parents working their way off the rolls would qualify
for a year of transitional child care and Medicaid benefits. States
could charge for the transitional services on a sliding scale.
   _For the first time the federal government would require all
states to pay cash benefits to two-parent welfare families. Only 27
do so now.
   _Starting in 1994, one adult in each two-parent welfare
household would have to participate in a job search and, if it
failed, 16 hours a week in a state-organized work activity. A young
parent could work instead toward a high school diploma.
   _States would have to step up child support collections from
non-custodial parents, including automatic wage withholding upon
the court award of support payments. States would get federal money
to set up a computerized tracking and monitoring system for child
support enforcement.
   _The $3.3 billion expense of the bill would be covered through a
variety of tax moves, among them eliminating the dependent care
credit now available for children aged 13 to 15 and extending for
five years the Internal Revenue Service's debt collection program.

<HEAD>Israeli Paper Says U.S. Struck Deal With Iran On Hostages</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Britain-Iran, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli newspaper reported Friday that the
United States has struck a secret deal with Iran, promising aid and
arms sales in exchange for the release of nine U.S. and British
hostages.
   President Reagan denied the report by The Nation, a 1-month-old
English-language weekly.
   ``We are not negotiating directly with Iran. We have not talked
to the kidnappers. I think maybe Iran is putting these stories
out,'' Reagan said in Chicago.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, on the presidential
plane en route to Chicago, left open the possibility that a third
party was holding talks with Iran in an effort to release the
hostages.
   The report, which quoted unidentified sources in Geneva, said
five American hostages held by Lebanese Shiites would be released
with Iran's help about Oct. 7. A second group of hostages,
including three Americans and a Briton, possibly Anglican clergyman
Terry Waite, would be released a week later, the paper said.
   It said that in return, the United States promised economic aid,
renewal of arms sales, the release of billions of dollars of frozen
Iranian assets in U.S. banks and resumption of diplomatic relations.
   But the report said arms sales would be renewed only after the
hostages were released, to avoid creating the impression of an
``arms for hostages'' deal.
   Fitzwater told reporters, ``I don't deny that there are people
talking to Iran about the hostages, but no U.S. officials are
talking to them. There is no one authorized to make a deal for
hostages or do anything that is contrary to our policy.''
   Hesh Kestin, the managing editor of The Nation, stood by the
story.
   ``I don't think a story is true or false because Washington
denies it,'' Kestin said. ``Washington has denied many stories and,
lo and behold, it eventually turns out that they're true.''
   Many news stories in the Middle East and elsewhere have said
that a hostage release is imminent, but the stories have not proved
accurate.
   Seventeen foreign hostages are believed held in Lebanon,
including nine Americans. Terry Anderson, the chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, is the longest held hostage.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The newspaper report said the U.S. put aside its demand that
Teheran release Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, one of the nine
Americans, because officials were convinced Iran does not control
the kidnappers holding him.
   The Iranians said they knew only that Higgins was spirited away
on a fishing boat off the Lebanese port of Tyre and transferred to
a larger ship at sea, the newspaper said.
   The Nation said the United States turned down the pro-Iranian
Islamic Jihad group's demand for $3 million in ransom for the
hostages.
   The paper also said Iranian commander-in-chief Hashemi
Rafsanjani escaped an assassination attempt last week as he was
being driven back from the parliament in Tehran. Four of his
bodyguards were killed in the ambush, the paper said.
   The report could not be confirmed.

   A patch of the Mojave
Desert will be open for anyone who wants to watch Discovery land
Monday, but spectators will have to endure traffic jams, chemical
toilets _ and maybe even rattlesnakes.
   NASA expects 100,000 to 200,000 visitors at the viewing site on
the hard clay east shore of Rogers Dry Lake, where the space
shuttle is scheduled to touch down at 9:33 a.m. PDT, said Nancy
Lovato, a spokeswoman for the space agency.
   The record crowd for a landing was the estimated 500,000 people
who joined President Reagan in witnessing the July 4, 1982, landing
of Columbia on a paved runway at this military base 80 miles
northeast of Los Angeles.
   This time George Bush will attend, in his capacity as vice
president, not as the Republican presidential candidate, his aides
emphatically told National Aeronautics and Space Administration
spokesman Ralph Jackson.
   The viewing site opens 24 hours before the landing. Jackson
predicted heavy traffic along the desert highways, ``And remember,
all the Air Police fellows out there got radar.''
   Lovato said the worst traffic jams will occur before dawn. Haley
said all gates to Edwards Air Force Base will be closed to the
general public, and access to the east shore viewing site _ which
doesn't require a vehicle pass or entry through any of the gates _
will be halted one hour before the landing.
   ``No gasoline is available at the viewing site,'' a NASA fact
sheet advised. ``No shelter from the sun will be available. No
telephones will be available. No plumbing or electricity will be
available. No dumping facilities for RV toilets will be available.''
   However, dozens of portable, chemical toilets already have been
placed on the lakeshore viewing site. Very little water or food
will be available, so spectators are advised to bring their own.
   The fact sheet also warned: ``Rattlesnakes are present and must
be respected.''
   ``People can camp out there, and if they have a recreational
vehicle, they'd be well advised to do that,'' Lovato said.
   Bush will watch the landing from the roof of NASA's building
here or from a ramp by NASA's hangar, which Lovato said also has
been invaded by rattlers at times.
   As for the general public, ``Somebody who wanders out of where
they're supposed to be into the hills behind the viewing site could
encounter some rattlesnakes,'' Haley said.
   But he said he's not aware of any snakebite victims among
spectators at past shuttle landings.
   ``Usually with all the people and vehicles, there's so much
noise the snakes stay away,'' Lovato said.

   Andrei A. Gromyko, whose unsmiling countenance and
tough talk personified the Soviet Union for nearly three decades,
is making a graceful exit by Soviet standards.
   The 79-year-old president, who represented his government as
foreign minister through most of the post-Stalin era, was retired
Friday from his post on the ruling Communist Party Politburo,
ostensibly at his own request. He is expected to surrender the
largely ceremonial presidency at a Saturday meeting of the Supreme
Soviet, or parliament.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev praised the outgoing
president for his ``great work and faithful service'' to the
Communist Party and the Soviet nation, indicating Gromyko is
leaving in good standing.
   As a further indication he remained in good stead, Gromyko's
comment that he was sad to be leaving but that ``age is a stubborn
thing'' was read on the national evening news, along with
Gorbachev's praise.
   Nicknamed ``Old Stoneface'' by the Western diplomats who faced
him through years of negotiations and East-West tensions, Gromyko
remained a symbol of continuity after Gorbachev moved him aside
three years ago to install Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a newcomer to
foreign policy, as the head of the Foreign Ministry.
   Since then, he has appeared at official functions, greeted
foreign visitors and performed various ceremonial tasks.
   In his longtime role as foreign policy chief, he was respected
by those who faced him across the bargaining table for his ability
to precisely enunciate Soviet policy and his voluminous knowledge
of historical detail.
   He always stuck to the official line and was known as a stubborn
negotiator who would rather walk away from negoatiations than
compromise on an issue critical to his government.
   After joining the Foreign Ministry and being posted to
Washington at the outbreak of World War II, Gromyko became
ambassador to the United States. In 1946, he was named his
country's first permanent U.N. representative.
   During the world body's formative years, he earned the nickname
``Mr. Nyet'' for the 26 vetoes he cast in the Security Council and
his frequent walkouts.
   Nikita Khrushchev, who elevated him to foreign minister, told
the United Nations that Gromyko was so loyal he would drop his
pants and sit on a block of ice if Khrushchev told him to. Gromyko
sat impassively as his leader spoke, as he did again several years
later when Khrushchev startled the General Assembly by removing his
shoe and banging it on his desk.
   Gromyko was a player in every superpower confrontation for more
than a quarter-century but rarely shared his private insights. His
memoirs, published after he left the Foreign Ministry, were most
notable for their lack of spicy detail.
   Although he was generally regarded as a party hardliner, Gromyko
reportedly played a pivotal role in the selection of the reformer
Gorbachev to take over the Soviet leadership in March 1985.
   Although Gorbachev removed him from the foreign minister's post
he had held for 26 years, the party chief kept him on in a visible
role as chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the
equivalent of the presidency.
   Gromyko's advancing age made his replacement inevitable, but
Gorbachev practically set a timetable for his retirement at the
party's national conference in June when he proposed a new
governmental structure with a strong president elected by an
expanded Congress of Peoples' Deputies.
   Gorbachev is expected to seek that post, probably in the spring.

   President Reagan, recalling his early days as a
radio announcer, visited Wrigley Field on Friday, calling the
play-by-play for a television broadcast of a Chicago Cubs baseball
game.
   Reagan, who had been scheduled to speak to a group of ethnic
leaders and attend a GOP fund-raiser during Friday's visit, made an
unscheduled stop at the venerable ballpark for a National League
game between the Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates.
   In his early days as a radio broadcaster in Davenport and Des
Moines, Iowa, Reagan used to re-create Cubs games on the air using
wire-service play-by-play.
   ``You know, in a few months I'm going to be out of work and I
thought I might as well audition,'' Reagan said after he was
introduced by Cubs announcer Harry Caray.
   Reagan called part of the first inning and the top half of the
second.
   Here's how he called the scoring play when the Cubs took a 1-0
lead in the bottom of the first:
   ``And there are still men on first and third. And there goes a
ball over second base and it's a hit out into center field.
   ``One run in. Men on first and third.''
   Reagan chatted with Caray and fellow announcer Steve Stone,
telling them his present job is more difficult than making up Cubs
play-by-play 50 years ago.
   ``Since I did the Cubs games by telegraphic report, I don't
think it was as hard as the present job, because by the time I got
the slip of paper it had already happened,'' he said.
   Before entering the broadcast booth, Reagan donned a red, white
and blue Cubs warm-up jacket and threw out the ceremonial first
pitch.
   From his vantage point, Caray called it ``high and inside.''

   Discovery's solid fuel boosters,
looking ``absolutely perfect'' except for slight discoloration,
were pulled ashore Friday for scrutiny by anxious experts who
revamped the rockets after the Challenger disaster.
   As curious gray-and-white seagulls squawked and glided overhead,
two recovery ships brought the empty casings into Port Canaveral's
choppy waters. Dozens of camera-armed tourists and some NASA
officials looked on.
   Other than some blackening at their bottoms and discoloration
attributed to the flames of liftoff, the 149-foot-long,
200,000-pound reusable boosters showed no outward signs of problems.
   ``It looked absolutely perfect,'' said John Thomas, who headed
oversight of the booster redesign for the Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala., the NASA center responsible for shuttle
propulsion.
   ``A-double-plus,'' was the estimate from Rocky Raab, spokesman
for Morton Thiokol Inc. of Brigham City, Utah, which build the
boosters.
   Rabb said divers who got the first look said they seemed ``in
perfect condition,'' adding that they ``would see evidence if the
joints were leaking ... there was none of that.''
   He said Morton Thiokol's contract specifications called for a
plus-or-minus 3 percent range in the pressure (pounds per square
inch) used by the boosters in blastoff, and the data returned
Thursday showed a deviation of only .09 percent.
   Divers waiting with special attachment devices in recovery ships
150 miles east of the Kennedy Space Center got to the boosters
quickly after they dropped off the shuttle two minutes, four
seconds after liftoff, their 81-feet-per-second descent slowed by
parachutes Thursday. Both were at Port Canaveral before noon,
several hours earlier than expected.
   As soon as the first booster was brought to port by the recovery
ship Freedom Star , an orange-suited safety inspector went out to
meet it in a lifeboat and crawled inside to begin taking a close
look and to check for leaks of volatile hydrazine.
   The boosters were then headed to a hangar at the Cape Canaveral
Air Force Station where technicians will use high-powered water
sprays to ensure safety and to clean them. Within two weeks, they
will taken apart under the watchful eyes of NASA officials and
technical experts of Morton Thiokol.
   Within two months they should be back at the Utah plant for
further examination and, barr notoriety after the Challenger
disaster, in which the boosters were blamed for causing the
explosion, piqued interest, along with television images Thursday
of flames spewing up the boosters' sides.
   ``It's pretty impressive. I'm pretty well informed on these; Ich and
people
remember what happened to Challenger, people looked at that and
they forgot that it's normal,'' said Raab.
   It was a failed joint that led to the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger
destruction, killing seven astronauts. A presidential commission
that investigated the accident found that rubberized O-rings did
not seal, allowing flame to escape.
   To return the grounded shuttle fleet to space as soon as
possible, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration chose
to redesign the Challenger-style boosters, a process that took 32
months instead of the four to five years required to develop an
entirely new design.
   NASA made 145 changes and then subjected the boosters to the
most rigorous testing program ever conducted for solid-fueled
rockets.
   The boosters are the largest solid-fueled rockets ever built.
   Loaded with 1.1 million pounds of propellant, each booster
weighs 1.3 million pounds and produces 3.3 million pounds of
thrust. The two boosters used in each shuttle launch provide 80
percent of the power need to reach orbit.

<HEAD>Britain Resumes Ties With Tehran; US Remains Cool</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain announced Friday a resumption of
full diplomatic ties with Iran based on ``mutual respect.'' It
accelerated an improvement in Western relations with the
fundamentalist government in Tehran.
   But Secretary of State George P. Shultz said any U.S. settlement
with Iran required an end to the Iran-Iraq war, an end to terrorism
and the release of Americans believed held by pro-Iranian forces in
Lebanon.
   Iran evidently wants to move toward a more normal position
around the world, but ``there is no change in the situation as far
as the United States and Iran is concerned,'' Shultz said at a news
conference.
   The British foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, announced the
move after meeting with the Iranian foreign minister, Ali Akhbar
Velayati. ``Both sides have decided to resume full diplomatic
relations on the basis of reciprocity and mutual respect,'' Howe
said.
   Velayati, referring to negotiations under way in Geneva between
British and Iranian representatives, said some details remained to
be worked out. Howe said the ties would be repaired ``in due
course.''
   In London, Iranian charge d'affaires Mohammad Basti said: ``Full
diplomatic relations are to be restored and we hope it will be at
ambassadorial level.''
   Britain pulled its diplomats out of Tehran last year after one
of its envoys was beaten and kidnapped in apparent reprisal for the
arrest in Manchester of an Iranian consul on shoplifting charges.
   The diplomat, Edward Chaplin, was released 24 hours after his
abduction in Tehran on May 28, 1987. Britain accused Iran of
unacceptable behavior and downgraded relations.
   While the two countries did not break diplomatic relations,
their ties were severely strained, and only the Iranian charge
d'affaires was allowed to remain in London.
   Howe, in a brief session with reporters in a U.N. corridor, said
there was ``no connection between the decision and any other
matters.''
   He apparently referred to Terry Waite, an envoy of the Anglican
church who vanished while on a mission to Lebanon, and two other
British hostages.
   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by
pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Waite, journalist John
McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man with dual British
and Irish nationality whose release is also sought by the Irish
government.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a
New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim
they killed him. His body was never found.
   The announcement follows signals from Iranian leaders that their
government was interested in improving relations with Western
countries.
   But the United States has stood apart from the trend, which
includes a recent restoration of ties between France and Iran and
improvements in Italian, West German, Canadian and Turkish
relations with Tehran.
   Shultz, at a separate session with reporters, said, ``The
principal things that need to be dealt with before anything
genuinely constructive can happen are an end to the war, an end to
terrorism and an end to the hostage problem.''
   Nine Americans are among the 17 Westerners missing in Lebanon.
The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Shultz stressed the United States was prepared to have direct
talks with Iran even though he had no plan to see Velayati while
they were attending the special General Assembly session.
   ``What we are doing and have been doing is the right approach,''
Shultz said. ``We have our views. We have our position. We have our
objectives.''
   U.S. ties with Iran were broken after the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
was sacked and American diplomats were taken hostage. The last 52
were released in 1981 after being held for 444 days.

<HEAD>No Gator Bites Reported in Florida as Hunting Season Draws to
Close</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State game officials said Friday that no gator
bites and only a few capsized airboats had been reported during
Florida's first alligator hunt in 26 years.
   The hunting season was to end at midnight Friday.
   Officials said it would take a few weeks to count how many
gators were bagged since Sept. 1 by the 238 hunters who won
licenses by lottery, but they say the hunt went off without any
major problems.
   Original projections of about 75 percent of the maximum
3,570-gator harvest seem accurate, officials said.
   For Grant Dunaway, the season end will be a chance to lock up
his alligator processing plant and rest.
   ``We've been going pretty much straight out all month. Now we're
going to add everything up and see if it was worth it,'' said
Dunaway, whose plant near Immokalee received about 180 alligators.
   Hunters were preparing for their final assault on the state's
waterways to reach their 15-alligator quota before midnight. A
large bull gator can fetch more than $1,000 in hide and meat.
   Dennis David, head of alligator monitoring for the state Game
and Fresh Water Fish Commission, said hide prices on the
international market have remained stable at $40 to $44 a foot, but
the hunt dropped local gator meat prices about 25 percent to $4 to
$5 a pound.
   Mike Jennings, a wildlife biologist for the game commission,
said the hunt was intended to cut back on the surplus alligator
population in a way that would allow an annual hunt.
   He said the state would try to teach hunters a few more of the
fine points, such as how to tag a gator and fill out paperwork.
   ``I think we covered safety pretty well,'' he said. ``There
weren't any significant injuries. People were generally cautious.''
   A full study on the impact of the hunt on the state's estimated
1 million alligators will be conducted, and new rules for next
year's hunt could be adopted in January, David said.
   Some possible revisions could be selecting new sites for the
hunt and loosening regulations to allow people without permits to
transport the gators to processing facilities, said David.
   Most infractions against permit holders were minor, including
hunting outside designated boundaries and failing to properly tag
the catch, he said. Several poachers were caught.
   ``But for the most part we're quite pleased with the way the
hunt was handled,'' said David. ``We didn't have anyone bitten like
people feared.''
   Veteran trappers had warned that selecting applications randomly
could lead to injuries among novices. But most rookies hired
experienced guides.
   Gator hunting is not without its element of danger. Most
alligators are delivered to the processing plants still kicking,
their mouths taped shut with duct tape.
   Hunters, skimming marshes and canals by airboat, use flashlights
or headlamps to pinpoint the red eyes of the mostly submerged
gators. They then try to bag them using harpoons, grappling hooks,
bows and tethered arrows, or bang-sticks, devices that shoot a
cartridge on impact.
   Several airboats capsized, but no injuries were reported, said
commission spokesman John White.
   State wildlife experts credit strong anti-poaching laws adopted
in 1970 as the main reason the alligator population has doubled in
the past two decades. The alligator was removed from the federal
endangered species list in 1977.
   In Lousiana, which opened its 17th annual 30-day season Sept.
10, 23,800 gators were taken last year.
   Texas, which resumed alligator hunts in 1984, issued permits for
1,500 gators for the 16-day season that ended Sept. 18.

   The fire, smoke and roar of
thundering rockets captures the attention of the nation, but it's
after the shuttle settles quietly into orbit that the real business
of space travel begins.
   Getting to space and returning may be the most fun, but being
there is the reason for the whole adventure. And the part that is
least noted by most Americans.
   NASA officials expressed elation and relief as Discovery slipped
smoothly into orbit. The spectacular launch proved to the world
that America's space agency had recovered from the flawed boosters
that destroyed Challenger 2{ years ago, killed seven crew members
and grounded the whole shuttle fleet.
   The moment of applause, of intense spotlighted attention, of
excitement and public triumph, passed within hours. Now it was time
to take up again the real purpose of flying in space.
   For the astronauts, this meant settling into a routine
controlled rigidly by a script that NASA calls the ``crew activity
plan.''
   The plan is designed to squeeze something useful out every of
precious astronaut minute in orbit. Waking, sleeping, eating and
working, the astronaut in space is directed by the ``CAP.''
   To make even a slight change in procedures, the astronauts are
supposed to get permission from engineers on the ground. ``Mission
Control Center'' is an accurate description of that command post in
Houston.
   Most of the work of astronauts in space concentrates on the
grinding routine and small details of scientists and engineers
exploring a new frontier and trying to build a body of
understanding. Progress is inch by inch and is seldom the stuff for
headlines or for the main story on the evening television news.
   Harassed astronauts may spend hours working quietly to conclude
a tedious task and then report the results in a single phrase:
``Houston, step five completed.'' Not exactly words that grab
national attention.
   Yet, it is from such work that the ultimate benefits from space
will be achieved.
   Aboard Discovery, the astronauts are working hour after hour
conducting experiments in medicine, materials processing, weather
observations and communications. They seldom take time to chat with
Mission Control and when they do, they speak in the spare shorthand
of technical minds hard at work.
   It's unlikely the four-day mission will provide a major
breakthrough that overnight will change the lives of people on
Earth. But each test will add another bit of new knowledge, perhaps
a single page in a growing library of understanding.
   Voyages to new frontiers are noted for their beginning and
ending. The hard work in between is seldom recalled. Who remembers
what Columbus did in the middle of the Atlantic on some September
day in 1492? It's his departure for the unknown and his arrival in
a new world that are honored.
   So, too, for Discovery. Its launch harvested headlines because
it marked America's return to space. And the shuttle landing on
Monday will again capture attention because daring men have
returned safely to Earth. But it is the work in between, the long,
quiet hours in space, that may eventually be the most important.

<HEAD>US Suggests Agreement Near on Cuban Troop Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Friday all parties
to peace negotiations in southwest Africa are in agreement that a
timetable for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola is
``obtainable.''
   In an upbeat account of four days of talks this week in the
Congolese capital of Brazzaville, deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
said the process has reached a ``crucial and likely final phase.''
   The timetable for the withdrawal of the more than 50,000 Cuban
troops has been the most difficult issue in the negotiations since
they began in their present form last May. With the United States
serving as mediator, officials from South Africa, Cuba and Angola
have held seven rounds of talks.
   The New York Times reported in Friday's editions that the
parties agreed in principal to a 24-month withdrawal timetable.
   Mrs. Oakley declined to give specifics, but her wording
indicated that the parties are working on a compromise that would
permit the Cubans to remain on longer than the time period sought
by South Africa.
   In return, the Cubans would redeploy their forces away from the
southern regions of Angola, the stronghold of the American-backed
anti-communist rebel movement.
   ``This is a complex matter in that it involves fixing not only
the final deadline for the departure of all Cuban troops but also
schedules for their phased redeployment and withdrawal prior to
that deadline,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   Initially, South Africa, with U.S. support, had insisted on a
Cuban withdrawal that would coincide with U.N.-supervised elections
for Namibia, a process which could begin Nov. 1 and end with the
installation of the territory's first independent government in
1989. South Africa has administered Namibia for 73 years.
   Cuba has been holding out for a longer withdrawal period,
apparently concerned that the pro-Marxist government may not be
able to cope with the powerful rebel movement.
   Mrs. Oakley suggested that differences over the timetable have
narrowed.
   ``All parties perceive that agreement on a timetable for Cuban
troop withdrawal from Angola is obtainable,'' she said. She also
suggested that some tentative decisions have been reached by the
negotiators which require final approval of their respective
governments.
   ``The negotiations have reached the point at which all parties
understand the final decisions they must make to achieve an
agreement,'' she said.
   ``These decisions which affect vital national interests and
security concerns can only be made at the highest levels of
government in Havana, Luanda and Pretoria.''

   Discovery's astronauts, having
consigned the world's most sophisticated communications satellite
to its 22,300-mile-high outpost, turned their attention to science
Friday as they whirled around Earth in their stockinged feet.
   ``They are having a ball,'' said a flight director.
   Back at Cape Canaveral, the redesigned booster rockets that
powered the first post-Challenger launch toward orbit Thursday were
towed into port and, divers who inspected them said they appeared
in perfect condition.
   The five astronauts were quickly proving to be a quiet,
businesslike crew as they looked down from their 184-mile perch at
interesting ocean currents, observed soil erosion in Mexico caused
by Hurricane Gilbert, watched how solutions separate in space and
did just plain sightseeing over the blue globe below.
   Conversations were confined to essentials, with little banter.
But when a television link with the ground failed to work _ the
antenna refused to move into usable position _ Commander Frederick
H. Hauck offered to help, saying ``We'll enjoy using our mechanical
talents.''
   The antenna problem persisted but its effect on the flight was
minimal. When the same thing happened four years ago, the repair
was performed by an astronaut who was taking a spacewalk anyway. No
such action was contemplated on this flight.
   The crew also had to contend with a temperature of 84 degrees in
the cabin, caused by a lingering malfunction in the cooling system.
A cumbersome fix was available, but Hauck passed it up, saying
``we're in good shape.''
   ``The orbiter is great, the systems on board the orbiter are
doing quite well,'' said J. Milton Heflin, a flight director in
Houston. ``We've talked about two or three problems today but, my
goodness, out of all the hardware aboard is operating just super,
and I can detect that in the voices of the crew. They are having a
ball.''
   The astronauts surprised Mission Control by playing the music of
``I Heard it Through the Grapevine'' as they were eating lunch. It
was a rejoinder to the day's wake-up call from the ground:
``G-o-o-d Morning, Discovery!'' Robin Williams, who perfected his
deejay routine in the movie, ``Good Morning Vietnam,'' prepared the
tape.
   In a televised science lesson from space, astronauts George D.
Nelson and David C. Hilmers demonstrated an experiment involving
cell separation in weightlessness. Hilmers explained it could have
medical applications such as separating malignant from
non-malignant cells.
   In Earth's gravity, when materials like the astronauts are
testing are mixed, the lighter one tends to float to the top.
Hilmers said in zero gravity it was more like a yolk floating
inside the egg white.
   The crew also was asked to photograph ``some of the natural
phenomena of the planet Earth'' _ including Pacific thunderstorms,
a volcano lava flow in Ethiopia and coastal erosion damage from the
Hurricane Gilbert on the Yucatan Peninsula.
   The astronauts all have been in space before and there were none
of the gee-whiz expressions that have been a staple of the shuttle
program.
   The worrisome booster rockets that carried the shuttle
flawlessly at the start of its journey, were towed into Port
Canaveral, near the launch site, apparently showing no sign of the
leaks that doomed the Challenger 32 months ago.
   ``The divers report the boosters are in perfect condition,''
said Rocky Raab, spokesman for booster manufacturer Morton Thiokol.
   He said the divers, who fished the rockets from the Atlantic for
inspection and refurbishment ``would see evidence if the joint were
leaking. They would see soot and the weather seals would be blown
off.''
   ``There was none of that,'' he said.
   Since Challenger, the boosters had undergone a major redesign to
ensure that the joints between segments would no longer allow hot
gases to escape: a problem on nine previous flights and the
malfunction that caused the space shuttle's destruction with its
loss of seven lives.
   The weather seals are inch-thick blankets _ made like electrical
tapes that prevent pipes from freezing _ to keep the joint seals
pliable at 75 degrees.
   Raab said it will be two weeks before the rocket shells are
taken apart for a minute inspection of the seals.
   The 2{-ton Tracking and Data Relay Satellite released by the
crew from Discovery's cargo bay late Thursday, was in its proper
orbit after a journey of 22,000 miles, and Mission Control told the
crew their launch was ``with considerable precision.''
   ``We're there. We're on orbit. We're very, very happy,'' said Ed
Bangsund of Boeing, manufacturer of the rocket stage that sent the
satellite to its final orbit. The TDRS will join another on orbit
since 1983 to give NASA communications contact with future shuttles
85 percent of the time.
   It also will serve as an orbital switchboard for up to 24
satellites, including some that will transmit coded military
information.
   The successful deployment was a major boost for NASA's TDRS
program, which has had trouble from the start. The first satellite
almost didn't make it when the Boeing rocket lost its steering
ability. In an almost miraculous rescue, controllers inched it to
its high orbit over a two-month period by using small steering
thrusters the size of a garden hose nozzle.
   In 1985, NASA removed a second TDRS from its shuttle cargo
schedule for redesign because of problems with one in orbit. The
next attempt to launch the satellite was in 1986. It was in the
cargo bay of the Challenger when it exploded after launch.
   NASA and the Pentagon considered the satellite so important it
was scheduled as the cargo for the first post-Challenger mission.
Another is set for launch in January.
   ``The launch and us getting back to space is something that
really means a lot to me,'' Richard Truly, the NASA shuttle chief
who supervised the post-Challenger recovery, said Friday. ``And
looking at today's front pages, I think it means a lot to the
country.
   The second day's flight plan was deliberately conservative to
enable the crew to carefully check the scores of system
modifications made in the spacecraft since the Challenger
explosion. ``We're not breaking any new ground,'' pilot Richard
Covey said before the launch.
   Discovery's four-day mission is to end with a landing on the
desert runway at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 12:33 p.m.
EDT on Monday.

<HEAD>Appeals Panel OKs Airline Furloughs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Friday upheld
Eastern Airlines' layoff of more than 3,000 employees when the
financially troubled carrier eliminated service to 14 cities to
stem continuing losses.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
there was insufficient evidence to support contentions of three
unions that the layoffs were part of an illegal campaign to weaken
the power of organized labor at Eastern.
   The unions ``have directed our attention to nothing that would
undermine Eastern's claim that legitimate business concerns provide
an ample reason for these reductions,'' the court said in an
opinion by Judge Stephen Williams.
   The panel noted that ``there is no claim that Eastern has
tailored its reductions so as to impose a differential impact on
union members. Indeed, it appears that the furloughs affect union
members and non-members in roughly their proportions of Eastern's
workforce.''
   The court also ruled that the layoffs of baggage handlers and
flight attendands were not an illegal change in working conditions
under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor negotiations in
the airline and railroad industries.
   The court found that U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker
had ``erred in granting the injunction as the furlough was not an
unlawful change in the status quo.''
   Last month, Parker had enjoined the layoffs. But the appeals
court had quickly dissolved the preliminary injunction, saying
Eastern could proceed to lay off affected employees if it posted a
$4.7 million bond while the case was appealed.
   In a statement from its Miami headquarters, the airline hailed
the decision as ``a very significant, positive development for
Eastern Airlines,''
   ``Eastern believes the decision is extremely important because
the court has reaffirmed management's right to operate its business
in the best interests of the company, its employees, shareholders
and the public,'' the company said.
   Union spokesmen expressed disappointment with the verdict and
said no decision had been made on how to proceed.
   Eastern, which has lost $1 billion since 1980, announced the
layoffs in July as part of a plan to eliminate unprofitable routes
to 14 cities and close its Kansas City hub.
   Citing losses of $120 million in the first six months of this
year, the company said it was restructuring its operation to
concentrate service along more profitable East Coast routes.
Profitable service to Latin American points would also be
maintained.
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, the Transport Workers Union of America and the Air Line
Pilots Association, contended that the furloughs were merely part
of an anti-union campaign being waged by Eastern's parent, Texas
Air Corp.
   The pilots union joined the legal challenge even though pilots
were not being laid off as a result of the schedule changes. The
airline said attrition would account for a reduction in pilot jobs.
   The unions argued that the layoffs were part of a plan by Texas
Air, which acquired the carrier in 1986, to transfer work to its
non-union subsidiary, Continental Airlines, and sell off profitable
Eastern assets.
   Judge Stephen Williams, in the opinion joined by Judges David
Sentelle and James L. Buckley, found that ``Eastern and Texas Air
officials have certainly expressed at least exasperation with
Eastern's unions.''
   But the panel said ``the present record provides little support
for any possible finding that forbidden purposes drove Eastern's
decisionmaking.''
   Eastern said it will save between $99 million and $199 million
in annual operating losses if it cut the unprofitable service plus
daily payroll savings of $160,000 from the layoffs.
   During the second quarter of this year, Eastern said it was
losing $1 million a day.
   Under schedule changes implemented Aug. 31, Eastern eliminated
140 of its 1,225 daily flights and will sell between 33 and 41
airplanes.
   Service was eliminated to Albuquerque, N.M.,; Reno and Las
Vegas, Nev.; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Okla.;
Omaha, Neb.; Dallas and San Antonio, Texas; San Diego; Tucson,
Ariz.; Fort de France, Martinique; Point-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe; and
St. Lucia, West Indies.
   Because Parker did not have enough time to fully explore the
claims of anti-labor bias, the panel said the union should be given
another opportunity to document their allegations in the lower
court.
   ``We do not view this decision as the end of the story,'' said
Joseph Guerrieri, a lawyer representing the IAM. He said the union
was studying whether to take the case back to Parker or seek a
rehearing by the full 11-member appeals court.
   ``We're very disappointed in the decision,'' said Nancy Currier,
vice president of the Transport Workers Local 553 in Miami, which
represents about 6,700 Eastern flight attendants. ``... Our legal
counsel is studying it and will advise us where we can go from
here.''
   ``We are committed to continuing to do whatever we can to stop
the furlough and bring our people back to work. If we can't do it
through the courts, we'll have to try to restore collective
bargaining,'' she said.
   She said union leaders are preparing to begin contract talks
with Eastern. Their contract becomes amendable Dec. 31.

   William Finch has been hauled in twice as a
deserter _ and he's not even in the Navy _ because someone
apparently used his name and Social Security number to enlist, then
ran off from the USS Roosevelt.
   ``We're very sensitive to this man's problem, and we don't want
it to happen it again,'' Navy spokeswomen Lt. Nancy Slivka said
Friday, a day after the 22-year-old bus driver was released from
Great Lakes Naval Training Center in suburban North Chicago.
   Finch's picture would be posted prominently in naval offices,
she said, and he will be given another document saying he is not
the man the Navy is seeking.
   Finch was given such a document after his first arrest in June
1987, she said. But he couldn't produce it when state police
arrested him Sunday at Starved Rock State Park, where he was
fishing, when a routine license plate check revealed an outstanding
warrant in his name.
   ``I was thrown in the La Salle County jail overnight and then
spent 3{ days in the brig at Great Lakes Naval Training Center,''
Finch said.
   Ms. Slivka disputed Finch's reference to the brig, saying he was
held in a unit without bars.
   But she said Great Lakes personnel undoubtedly treated him as a
deserter.
   ``When we go out and pick up a deserter, he's not necessarily
going to come along willingly,'' she said.
   ``Experience has told these people they may hear a number of
different stories. Based on the information they had in front of
them ... they processsed him as if he were a deserter.''
   Finch said his hair was cut short and he was forced to march
until a federal judge issued an order to free him.
   The Navy first got its signals crossed with Finch on June 3,
1987, when Chicago police stopped him for a burned-out taillight.
The desertion warrant turned up during a routine license-plate
check that time, as well.
   After spending a night in jail, Finch was taken to Great Lakes
for questioning and a comparison of descriptions.
   ``He was 5 foot 4 inches; I am 5 foot 7 inches. He weighed 140
pounds; I weigh 220. He didn't have any scars; I have a large scar
from a kidney operation. He was left-handed; I am right-handed.''
   Finch was released immediately that time.
   He had more trouble this time because the statistics on the
deserter had to be mailed from Washington, Ms. Slivka said.
   ``The Navy sent the records by mail on Monday,'' Assistant U.S.
Attorney Thomas Walsh said Thursday. ``It must have been by route
of a slow boat to China. The records still aren't here.''
   Said Daniel Crowe, Finch's attorney: ``If the judge hadn't
agreed to hear the case, Finch would have been in the brig until
next week.''
   Telephone calls to Crowe's office Friday for details on the
court action were not returned. Finch was not home, his mother said.
   Ms. Slivka called Finch's ``a very rare and unusual case,''
although in a similar one in February 1987, a 27-year-old grocery
clerk was arrested for desertion by the Navy.
   Finch said he bears no ill will toward the Navy but is worried
about missing four days of his job.
   And there's one more problem.
   Finch recently received a letter from the Internal Revenue
Service. It appears the other Finch owes Uncle Sam $900 in back
taxes.
   ``He is still out there and still using my identity,'' said
Finch. ``Who knows what other stuff he has been pulling?''

   Republican George Bush tweaked rival
Michael Dukakis again Friday by traveling to the governor's home
state to claim the endorsements of two Massachusetts law
enforcement organizations.
   During a day in which he also courted voters in New Jersey and
Connecticut with a tough-on-crime pitch, Bush made a foray into
Massachusetts to accept the backing of the International
Brotherhood of Police Officers, Local 264, and the Springfield
Police Supervisors Association.
   The president of the first group, Robert Jacobson, told a small
gathering outside Springfield police headquarters that ``Michael
Dukakis is soft on crime and George Bush is tough on crime.''
   Bush called the state's prison furlough program under Dukakis
``a national disgrace'' and said he appreciated the endorsement
because ``you know the truth not just about me but about my
opponent as well.''
   ``I am running as myself, and my opponent is running from
himself,'' he said.
   The Bush campaign did not announce the Springfield stop until
about three hours ahead of time to avoid a counter-attack by
Dukakis, press secretary Sheila Tate acknowledged.
   When Bush was recently endorsed by the Boston Police Patrolmen's
Association, Dukakis quickly put together his own big law
enforcement show of support the same day.
   Also on Friday, Bush campaigned in New Jersey and went into
heavily Democratic Paterson County to pick up the endorsement of
five locals of the Police Benevolent Association.
   Bush campaign officials said their analysis agrees with local
polls that show the race even in New Jersey, which has 16 electoral
votes, and close in Connecticut with eight electoral votes.
   The campaign is making a concerted push for the middle-class
Democrats who crossed party lines to vote for President Reagan.
That appeal was part of Friday's law-and-order and anti-drug
message.
   In New Jersey, Bush and Gov. Thomas Kean also met in the morning
with a group of black ministers who helped Kean in his last
gubernatorial race.
   Bush spoke to a rally in Paterson, where he said he would
appoint tough judges and support the death penalty for drug
kingpins and murderers of police officers.
   The public address system for Bush's outdoor speech was turned
up as a band of about 30 demonstrators, many of them young people,
chanted loudly from across the street, ``Where was George?''
   The motorcade buses were moved into the street blocking the
protesters' view of the rally. Police officers also stood in the
streets in front of them.
   Passaic County Sheriff Edwin Englehardt, in his introductory
remarks, said, ``There's half a dozen kids across the street. They
represent the ACLU, Mr. Vice President, but don't worry about that.
The vast majority of people are law-abiding and they're for you.''
   Bush frequently criticizes the American Civil Liberties Union
and Dukakis' membership in it.
   The vice president ridiculed Dukakis' environmental campaign
trip to New Jersey on Thursday and took a familiar swipe at the
water pollution in Boston Harbor under Dukakis' governorship.
   ``My opponent had the nerve yesterday to come in here and talk
about oceans you can't swim in. You tried to drink the water in
Boston Harbor recently? Don't do it,'' Bush said.
   Then, poking fun at his own misstatement of the date of the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Bush quipped, ``I may have a
little trouble remembering Pearl Harbor, but I don't have any
trouble remembering Boston Harbor.''
   Bush also spoke at Ridgefield Memorial High School in
Ridgefield, N.J., where he told students to shun drugs and
encourage their parents not to use drugs. He warned against
``enabling behavior'' in which students keep quiet while their
friends abuse drugs.
   ``Make it uncool to do drugs,'' he said.
   Bush later headed to Hartford, Conn., to meet with Roman
Catholic Archbishop John Whealon and to address a rally at St.
Joseph College.

<TEXT>
   Union Station, a magnificent Beaux Arts
structure that welcomed train travelers to the nation's capital for
a half-century before crumbling into decay in the 1950s, came back
to life on Thursday.
   ``Today, we're proud to give you a building brought back to life
by American business at its best and government at its best. Union
Station is a train station again,'' said Stuart Scott, president of
LaSalle Partners Ltd., which supervised the $160 million
rehabilitation project.
   More than 100,000 red, white and blue balloons were released,
confetti rained down, and the whistle of an 80-year-old steam
engine blasted as officials swung open the mahogany doors of the
immense structure and a crowd of thousands swarmed inside.
   ``Its magnificent,'' said Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley.
``We're looking at a complete 180-degree reversal of the problems
caused by government incompetence in past projects involving the
station.''
   Union Station had fallen into neglect with the decline in train
ridership in the '50s and was destined for the wrecking ball when
it was designated a national landmark in 1964.
   The Nixon administration spent $48 million trying to convert the
station into a National Visitors Center for the nation's
bicentennial in 1976, but the project failed and the doors swung
shut.
   Cobwebs gathered in the corners and toadstools sprang up in the
dirt on the floor over the years. Train travelers have been
reaching the capital's Amtrak station by way of a temporary walkway
along the west side of the building.
   In 1981, President Reagan signed the Union Station Redevelopment
Act, which called on the private sector to manage another
restoration, launching the beginning of a seven-year effort.
   ``The federal government has demonstrated a remarkable level of
incompetence in years gone by,'' said Burnley. ``And we were
determined that it was going to be done right this time.''
   The redevelopment team _ La Salle, a national real estate firm;
Williams Jackson Ewing, a retail developer and leaser; and
architect Benjamin Thompson & Associates of Boston _ patterned the
renovation on original architect Daniel Hudson Burnham's 1907
design.
   Those who attended the opening, many of them employees from
nearby Capitol Hill offices, strolled through the airy shopping
mall admiring the high vaulted ceiling with its etched gold finish.
   The massive, sun-filled main hall of the structure resembles a
museum, with high balconies framing Roman-style statues and arched
windows.
   Amtrak has 22 ticket counters and a baggage carousel in the mall
area. Some 210,000 square feet of retail space will houses many
upscale shops and a string of restaurants. A nine-screen,
2,000-seat movie theatre is scheduled to open in November.
   The District of Columbia government is building a parking garage
for 1,500 cars with $40 million in federal highway money. Lack of
parking was considered one reason for the failure of the earlier
renovation effort.
   Officials are optimistic that, with more than 33,000 subway
commuters and 8,400 Amtrak passengers using the station daily,
combined with the thousands of people who work nearby, the new
Union Station will be a success.

   A ``perfect child'' was buried Friday
when friends and family gathered to mourn one of two 8-year-old
girls who died after a gunman opened fire in their school, wounding
nine other people.
   Shequila Bradley died in the school after a man identified as
James William Wilson, 19, of Greenwood, walked in Monday and began
shooting.
   Tequila Jones died Thursday; her funeral was set for Sunday.
   ``Shequila was the kind of child that always wanted to please
people. If there had been the perfect child, she would have been
it,'' Eleanor Rice, principal of Oakland Elementary School, said at
Friday's funeral.
   Wilson has been charged with two counts of murder and is
undergoing psychiatric testing at the State Hospital in Columbia.
   The Greenville News reported Friday that a state mental health
center had rejected two attempts since 1986 by Wilson's relatives
to have him involuntarily committed for psychiatric care.
   ``The only comfort I have at this point is that I know she's
with God _ he only takes the best,'' Mrs. Rice told a
standing-room-only audience at the New Jerusalem Deliverance Church.
   The girl's mother, Lynn Bradley, had to be carried into the
funeral.
   ``She was crazy about her kids, Shequila was her heart,'' said a
neighbor, Lena Moore. ``If you lost your baby _ that's a lot to
think about.''
   Among the flowers arranged around Shequila's coffin was a
bicycle of flowers, made by some of Shequila's friends.
   ``Oakland will never be the same, but we'll always remember her
with that special smile,'' the principal told relatives, school
officials and faculty, classmates, and friends.
   Relatives have described Wilson as a hyperactive recluse who has
been in and out of a hospital psychiatric unit during the past
eight months.
   Retired Probate Judge Rosemary M. Trakas told the Greenville
newspaper that Wilson's family filed affidavits for involuntary
commitment and Wilson was evaluated by a state mental health center.
   She told the newspaper that, after the evaluation, Beckman
Mental Health officials declined to admit Wilson into the state
mental hospital system.
   The Department of Mental Health ``can't confirm or deny that a
person has been a patient or has received treatment from the
department,'' spokeswoman Susan Craft said Friday. ``That's the
law. It's a confidentiality statute.''
   Neighbors of the Bradley family say the neighborhood has been
devastated.
   ``It's torn up this neighborhood,'' said Mrs. Moore. ``I felt
like I lost one of my own children, I'm still hurting.''
   ``The whole neighborhood just hates that this happened to a
little child for something stupid,'' said Mrs. Moore.
   ``Anyone who just sits around and thinks about doing this, they
shouldn't just let him get off 'cause he's crazy,'' she said.
   Eight-year-old Jana Moore said she knew Shequila well.
   ``She used to spend the night over my house, and she used to go
over my grandmother's house,'' Jana said. ``I was in the class next
door when he shot Shequila. We heard noise like someone getting
beat with a whip, but it was that man shooting.''

   The Federal Aviation Administration said
Friday that a further check of its records indicated that South
Pacific Island Airways has not _ as the agency said previously _
surrendered its commuter airline operating certificate.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said South Pacific Island's status was
rechecked after complaints from the airline about its inclusion
Thursday in a list of seven air carriers that the FAA said had
surrendered their certificates before scheduled safety inspections.
   South Pacific Island continues to operate commuter service in
the America Samoa islands, although it did turn in a certificate as
a charter airline after deciding not to continue operating such
flights, Farrar said.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the parent company of Texas National
Airlines of San Antonio disputed the FAA statement that it had
surrendered its commuter license.
   Brian Loflin, corporate communications director for Fairchild
Aircraft Corp. of San Antonio, Texas, said Texas National, a
subsidiary of Fairchild, got out of the commuter business in August
but did not surrender its certificate and continues flying as a
charter service.
   But Farrar said FAA records show the airline had surrendered the
certificate that had allowed it to provide scheduled commuter
service, although he said Texas National continues to provide
on-demand air taxi service.
   Another airline also disputed FAA assertion that it surrendered
its commuter certificate.
   Ron Warren, general manager of Grand Canyon Airlines, said the
airline no longer operates commuter services but continues to fly
sightseeing charters over the Grand Canyon.
   Warren said the certificate it uses for the sightseeing tours is
the same as its commuter certificate. But Farrar said while the
airline's sightseeing flights may not be affected, its license to
operate scheduled commuter service was surrendered.
   The airlines were among more than 35 commuter airlines that had
been targeted for special safety inspections under a broader FAA
probe of the commuter airline industry's compliance with federal
safety regulations.

   The Kremlin shake-up on Friday promoted Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's friends and pushed out the old guard in a quick,
unanimous vote that harked back to the power plays of his
pre-glasnost predecessors.
   Simultaneously, the policy-making Communist Party Central
Committee took the first step toward fulfilling the Soviet leader's
promise of getting the party out of the day-to-day management of
the government.
   The decision to eliminate some departments of the party
bureaucracy and consolidate others means hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of the Soviet Union's top Communist Party bureaucrats
will lose their jobs on the powerful staff of the Central Committee.
   ``A considerable amount of real political power is being
transferred to the local level,'' said newly promoted Politburo
member Vadim Medvedev at a news conference after the Central
Committee meeting.
   He explained that departments traditionally responsible for
overseeing industrial enterprises throughout the country are being
eliminated. That is designed to shift responsibility for
decision-making to local managers.
   This is another step toward moving power out of Moscow and the
central government that is now blamed for the country's economic
problems. Under the system of central planning established by Josef
Stalin, bureaucrats have long made decisions as minute as how many
nails should go to the Siberian city of Novosibirsk.
   But in cutting the number of Central Committee departments from
approximately 20 to just six, Gorbachev concentrated power in a
smaller number of positions _ and won most of those jobs for his
supporters.
   Two of the six are key Gorbachev advisers _ Georgy Razumovsky
and Alexander Yakovlev _ and two are men elevated to the Politburo
under Gorbachev's wing _ Nikolai Slyunkov and Medvedev.
   Only one of the six new jobs went to a man considered a
Gorbachev rival, Yegor Ligachev, and his transfer from the party's
No. 2 post to agriculture appeared to be a demotion.
   These decisions, extensive enough to shake the Moscow power
structure to its foundations, were made in less than an hour as the
300-member Central Committee accepted the recommendations of the
ruling Politburo. It bore none of the marks of glasnost, the
openness Gorbachev championed at the national party conference just
three months ago.
   President Andrei Gromyko and Politburo member Mikhail S.
Solomentsev, retired from their party posts Friday, were among
those named in a stunning public criticism at the party conference
in June as members of the Old Guard who ought to be removed.
   Medvedev said the personnel changes were designed to place in
key positions ``people who support perestroika,'' Gorbachev's
policy of economic reform, and ``those who enjoy the full trust of
party members and non-party members.''
   The reform relieves Soviet industry of an entire top level of
bureaucrats and eliminates a major overlap of party and government
by abolishing seven of the eight departments of the party's Central
Committee devoted to specific industries.
   Only agriculture, long a serious problem for the Soviet Union,
will have one of the six new commissions entirely devoted to it.
   The other five commissions will be concerned with broad
policies, in line with Gorbachev's stated goal of having the party
give direction rather than detailed orders.
   Razumovsky will run personnel, a key position determining
hiring, firing and promotions. Yakovlev will be responsible for
overseeing international affairs.
   Medvedev, an economics professor, gets Ligachev's former post in
charge of ideology, which will now include the former departments
of propaganda, culture and education. Nikolai Slyunkov, who made
the Byelorussian republic an example of Gorbachev's economic
perestroika, was given socio-economic concerns.
   Viktor M. Chebrikov, the KGB chief, gets legal and judicial
policy, an apparent promotion. Chebrikov may be relieved of the KGB
post Saturday when the nation's legislature holds an extraordinary
session to make personnel changes related to those made by the
party Friday.
   More personnel changes are expected Saturday and Monday when two
legislative bodies meet to consider changes stemming from the
Central Committee decisions.
   The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is expected to name a new
KGB chief on Saturday, since Chebrikov is unlikely to hold two such
important jobs.
   On Monday, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation meets,
leading to speculation that the chairman of its Council of
Ministers, Politburo member Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, is headed for a
new assignment.
   As many as half the Central Committee's staff members will lose
their jobs and be transferred to the government, universities, and
professional jobs, Medvedev said.
   When asked the current size of that bureaucracy, he would say
only that a reporter's estimate of 6,000 was ``several times'' too
large.
   The Central Committee staff fills an imposing office complex in
Moscow topped with a red banner.
   The transfers will be made very carefully, Medvedev emphasized,
because ``the party apparatus has the best personnel. They are
professionals. We will try to create favorable conditions for
them.''

<HEAD>UNIFIL: A Mission Impossible?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MAJDAL ZOUN, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hours after the Nobel Peace Prize
was awarded to U.N. peacekeepers, six rounds of machine-gun fire
blasted into the hill behind a U.N. observation post near this
south Lebanese village.
   ``It's just part of our job,'' said Lt. Arjun Sapkota, 29, of
Nepal, who said being shot at is not an unusual experience here.
   The post's 5,800 soldiers of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon,
or UNIFIL, undoubtedly have one of the most difficult missions of
the seven United Nations forces sharing the prize _ watching 240
square miles of southern Lebanon.
   UNIFIL was deployed in 1978 to supervise the withdrawal of an
Israeli invading force. But the Israelis haven't fully withdrawn
and UNIFIL is sandwiched between them and a myriad of militias that
have sprouted in Lebanon.
   ``It has seemed a mission impossible at times,'' said Lt. Col.
Gerry McMahon, of Ireland, UNIFIL's senior operations officer and a
veteran of U.N. peace missions in Zaire, Cyprus, Syria and Lebanon.
   Still, he said, UNIFIL has made a difference in a country
factionalized by 13 years of civil war and at odds with its Israeli
neighbor.
   ``If UNIFIL didn't exist here, this place would be a
battlefield,'' McMahon said. ``We have been a stabilizing influence
in southern Lebanon.''
   UNIFIL troops, with headquarters in the southern town of
Naquora, can be distinguished by their pale blue helmets and berets
and the blue-and-white banner that flies above their observation
posts and roadside checkpoints. Nepal, Fiji, Ireland, Ghana,
Finland, Norway, Sweden, France and Italy contribute to the force.
   UNIFIL has paid dearly. About 156 men have died in service, and
more than 230 have been wounded. Two are missing. American Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins, leader of a truce observer group attached to
UNIFIL, was kidnapped Feb. 17 by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
militiamen.
   An Irish soldier, Pvt. Brian Joyce, has been missing for seven
years; he has not been seen since he disappeared from a desolate
outpost.
   There is little to suggest the danger will abate soon.
   ``The fact is that we are trying to do our job while what
amounts to a war is going on around us,'' McMahon said. ``It's
inevitable we get caught in the middle.''
   As envisioned by the U.N. Security Council in 1978, the U.N.
force was given a mandate to supervise Israel's withdrawal and help
the Lebanese army reestablish authority in the region.
   Instead, Israel continues to hold a strip of land along the
border as a security zone and augmented its forces with an
Israeli-equipped and trained militia known as the South Lebanon
Army, a Christian-dominated group.
   Palestinian guerrillas, largely driven out of southern Lebanon
by a second Israeli invasion in 1982, have been replaced by
increasingly militant Shiite militias.
   The Iran-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is among militias
hostile to all foreign presence and which continue to try and
penetrate UNIFIL territory to attack Israel.
   The U.N. soldiers have ended up being victimized by both sides.
   In 1985, the South Lebanon Army abducted 21 Finnish soldiers and
held them for more than a week after alleging they had helped seven
of its militiamen defect to Moslem groups.
   In 1986, several French soldiers were killed in a series of
attacks blamed on Iranian-backed Shiite fighters angered over the
sale of French weapons to Iran's Persian Gulf war foe, Iraq.
   Eighteen months ago, a car bomb exploded beside a Fijian
checkpoint, killing three soldiers.
   Since the start of this year, more than 864 incidents have been
reported in which bullets or artillery fell on or near U.N.
positions.
   But UNIFIL has succeeded, to some extent, in returning normalcy
to the more than 500,000 people who live in the territory under its
supervision.
   Militiamen are not allowed to enter the region with weapons, and
UNIFIL sponsors medical and food relief programs to help the
largely Shiite population.
   It does not always succeed in its job as referee.
   On Friday, for example, members of the Shiite militia Amal set
up a ``checkpoint'' on a tiny village road near Majdal Zoun,
apparently to try to halt any suspected members of the rival
Hezbollah. Tension between the two militias has been running high
since three Amal leaders were slain last week, apparently by
Hezbollah fighters.
   Meanwhile, Israel complains that groups intent on attacking the
Jewish state, including Palestinian guerrillas, have made it
through UNIFIL territory undetected.
   ``We do try to watch everything,'' said Nepalese Corp. Arjun
Dahal, as he peered trough field glasses at the surrounding hills.
``I watch positions for any movement or firing that takes place and
I report it immediately so we can get it stopped.''

<HEAD>Bentsen Focuses On Education; Says Quayle Resume Empty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lloyd Bentsen ridiculed George Bush's
education promises, saying the vice president's ``record on
education is as empty as Dan Quayle's resume.''
   The Democratic vice presidential nominee addressed an early
afternoon rally in Charlotte before heading to Washington to accept
the National Education Association endorsement of Bentsen and
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis. The Texas senator was taking
the weekend off to preprare for his debate next week with Quayle.
   At the rally, Bentsen thanked North Carolina for hosting the
debate between Dukakis and Bush and said the showdown proved ``that
Mike Dukakis is the one who is in mainstream America.
   ``Every time that Mike Dukakis starting talking about crucial
issues that face America _ about drugs and housing and health care
and education and Social Security _ it seemed that George Bush had
nothing to say for himself,'' Bentsen said.
   Bentsen promoted the Democratic ticket's chances in the South
and specifically mentioned Texas and North Carolina _ two major
Dukakis-Bentsen targets.
   His text also included Arkansas, another state where the
Democrats are counting on a win, but he did not mention either
Mississippi or Alabama, states that several Dukakis aides have
conceded privately appear out of reach and among states that will
be de-emphasized in the final weeks of the campaign.
   At one point in his speech Bentsen mistakenly referred to being
in South Carolina, another state where Dukakis aides concede
privately that their chances are slim, but quickly corrected
himself. ``Let's get the message to them, too,'' he said to laughs
from the crowd.
   Bentsen said Dukakis had a key Southern value _ fiscal
conservatism _ and said it stood in stark contrast to the
Reagan-Bush record of deficit spending.
   ``George Bush likes to talk about balanced budgets,'' Bentsen
said. ``It's like Dan Quayle talking about his resume. There's
nothing to say.''
   He adopted a similar line for his later speech to the NEA
convention in Washington.
   ``George Bush woke up one morning and decided he wanted to be
the education president, but there is no evidence that he has ever
lifted a hand to help education in America, I'll tell you,''
Bentsen said in the text of that address. ``His record on education
is as empty as Dan Quayle's resume.''
   The senator, in the speech to the labor group, said the Reagan
administration as undermined a number of education programs,
including funding for college loans, remedial education and teacher
improvement.
   Bentsen said Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, had taken his
state from 40th to 10th in terms of per-student spending while also
supporting programs to improve teacher quality. He also touted
Dukakis' proposal to allow students to repay college loans through
long-term payroll deductions.
   At the North Carolina rally, which was attended by about 500
people, Bentsen promised a strong national defense and an
administration ``ready to pay the price to defend freedom.''
   As for the debate, Bentsen told reporters aboard his plane he
would spend most of the weekend preparing and practicing. Advisers
who helped Dukakis prepare for his debate are part of the Bentsen
effort.

   Here are thumbnail sketches of the top Soviet
officials at the center of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's shake-up of the
Kremlin hierarchy:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ANDREI A. GROMYKO _ Resigned his Politburo post Friday after 15
years as a full member. Gromyko, 79, assumed the largely ceremonial
post of president four months after Gorbachev became general
secretary in March 1985. During his 28 years as foreign minister,
Gromyko _ dubbed ``Old Stone Face'' for his dour expression _ was
widely respected for his negotiating ability and his grasp of
international affairs. His official duties as president mainly
involved protocol functions, but he remained an influential
Politburo member. It was said to be his vote that broke a tie in
the Politburo and elected Gorbachev party leader. But his influence
appeared to wane under Gorbachev. At the June party conference a
delegate said Gromyko was not fit to hold office because of his
inability to work under Gorbachev's reforms. Trained as an
economist, Gromyko served in the Soviet Embassy in Washington under
Josef Stalin and became foreign minster under Nikita S. Khrushchev.
   --- MIKHAIL S. SOLOMENTSEV _ Regarded as an expert on heavy
industry, was retired from his positions as a full Politburo member
and head of the Party Control Commission, charged with
investigating reports of corruption by party officials. At the June
party conference a delegate said Solomentsev, 75, should retire
because he could not work under Gorbachev's reforms. Solomentsev
headed a commission reviewing rehabilitation of victims of Stalin's
repression. He was born into a peasant family, worked in
agriculture and industry and was appointed a non-voting member of
the Politburo in 1971. It was more than a decade before he was
elevated to full member. While a non-voting Politburo member,
Solomentsev was premier of the Russian Republic, the largest of the
Soviet Union's 15 republics.

   ANATOLY F. DOBRYNIN _ Dobrynin, 68, ambassador to Washington for
24 years, was sent into retirement after having served since 1986
as Communist Party Central Committee secretary for foreign affairs.
He was dean of the Washington diplomatic corps at the end of his
tenure in Washington, which spanned the administrations of six
presidents and shattered the stereotype of dour Soviet envoys.
Malcolm Toon, former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, called Dobrynin
``one of the ablest diplomats of the 20th century.'' Dobrynin, son
of a plumber, was an aeronautical engineer in World War II. His
English studies paved the way for a diplomatic career. He went to
Washington in 1952 as an embassy counselor, returned to Moscow in
1960 and went back to Washington two years later.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   VLADIMIR I. DOLGIKH _ A candidate member of the Politburo since
May 1982, Dolgikh, 63, was retired from the job to which he was
appointed by President Leonid I. Brezhnev six months before
Brezhnev's death. Dolgikh first gained attention as head of the
Norilsk mining complex in northern Siberia during the 1960s. He
earned the reputation of a good industrial manager, and was in
charge of heavy industry in his later role on the Politburo. When
ethnic unrest erupted this year in Armenia, Dolgikh was among those
sent there by Moscow to try to ease tensions. He left Norilsk in
1969 to become district head of the Communist Party in Krasnoyarsk.
In 1971, he was named to the Central Committe and in 1976 became
head of the Central Committee's heavy industry department.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PYOTR N. DEMICHEV _ Demichev, 70, a non-voting Politburo member
for 24 years, also was retired. He had held the largely ceremonial
job as deputy to Gromyko since his removal in 1986 as culture
minister. He exerted a conservative influence on the arts during
his 12 years as minister. His shift from that position was regarded
as a move by Gorbachev to allow greater openness. Demichev earned a
reputation in the 1950s as an authority on ideology for his
involvement in city and neighborhood propaganda departments and as
an experienced industrial manager. Like Dolgikh, Demichev was sent
to Armenia to smooth ethnic tensions, but overall his role was
greatly reduced after Gorbachev rose to power.

<TEXT>
   VADIM A. MEDVEDEV _ Medvedev was named a full member of the
Politburo two years after being chosen a full member of the Central
Committee, bypassing candidate membership. Little is known about
the Medvedev, 59, an engineer and economist and a former rector of
the Academy of Social Sciences in the Central Committee. He was an
assistant professor at the Leningrad Institute of Rail Transport,
and in 1968 was elected secretary of the city's Communist Party
Committee. From 1978 to 1983, he was a deputy head of the Central
Committee's propaganda department. He gained full membership in the
Central Committee in February 1986. A month later he was named
secretary for science and education.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ALEXANDRA P. BIRYUKOVA _ Her appointment to the Politburo as a
non-voting member makes her the first woman to hold such a high
post since former Culture Minister Yekaterina Furtseva, a full
member from 1957 to 1961. A former trade union official, Biryukova,
59, has served as Central Committee secretary in charge of light
industry and consumer goods since 1986. Born in the Moscow area,
she became a shop forewoman at a fabric plant in 1952, joined the
party in 1956 and moved steadily up within the trade union ranks to
become deputy chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions in
1985 to 1986. She became a full member of the Central Committee in
1976.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ANATOLY I. LUKYANOV _ Lukyanov, 58, was chief of the Central
Committee's general department until his appointment as a
non-voting member of the Politburo. The general staff is the
Politburo's administrative arm and all secret documents must pass
through the department. Lukyanov graduated in 1953 with a law
degree from Moscow State University and was chief consultant of the
Council of Ministers, or Cabinet, legal commission from 1956 to
1961. From 1969 to 1976, he was deputy chief of the Supreme
Soviet's Department of Soviet Activities and in 1977 became chief
of the Presidium's secretariat. His new responsibilities are
uncertain.

<TEXT>
   ALEXANDER V. VLASOV _ Vlasov, elevated to non-voting status on
the Politburo, was trained as a mining engineer and climbed
steadily through the party apparatus to become minister of the
interior in charge of the nation's uniformed police. He began as
foreman in a Siberian coal mine and joined the party in 1956. In
the 1960s, he was active in Irkutsk party politics. Vlasov, 56, was
a member on the Military Council of the North Caucasian Military
District during the period that Gorbachev served there. He was
named candidate member of the Central Committee in 1976 and a full
member in 1981. He was appointed interior minister in 1986.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Friday ruled out the
priesthood for women but condemned sexual discrimination in a major
teaching that will shape the debate on women in the Roman Catholic
Church.
   ``Mulieris Dignitatem,'' Latin for ``On the Dignity of Women,''
attempts to define women's nature and role in the church and
society.
   The document concludes that men and women are equal but
fundamentally different and thus play different roles. Women, it
says, are formed by maternal qualities.
   John Paul says women who choose celibacy as a vocation, such as
nuns, accept a ``spiritual motherhood.''
   While highly theoretical, the document provides a framework for
specific issues the church is expected to tackle in coming years,
such as the positions and influence women can have in the church
structure.
   The ban on women priests and deacons has been a source of
considerable tension between the Vatican and Catholics in the
United States and western Europe.
   The 120-page document is an apostolic letter, which means it
will be presented to Roman Catholics as church teaching but is not
an infallible pronouncement.
   ``Here the Holy Father ... is offering us the essential and
inescapable facts and principles that you need to sensibly debate
the role and mission of women,'' Archbishop Jan Schotte said at a
news conference where the document was presented.
   ``It's not new in terms of content but it's new in bringing
together the teaching of Scriptures and the whole tradition of the
church in a document that speaks to the theme of women now,'' he
said.
   Schotte was secretary-general of last year's worldwide synod of
bishops on the role of the laity. The question of women played a
major role at the synod.
   Vatican officials said the document expresses the pope's beliefs
shaped by years of reflection on the subject of women, but did not
involve scientists or other outside experts.
   Much of the document consists of a strong defense of women's
equality with men and praise for their contributions. The pope
equates sexual discrimination and domination over women with sin
and condemns men who fail to take responsibility for their sexual
acts.
   He advises fathers:
   ``It is the woman who `pays' directly for this shared generation
(of a child) ... It is therefore necessary that the man be fully
aware that in their shared parenthood he owes a special debt to the
woman. No program of `equal rights' between women and men is valid
unless it takes this fact fully into account.''
   But the pope stated that women and men have fundamentally
different characters.
   ``The personal resources of femininity are certainly no less
than the resources of masculinity; they are merely different,'' the
document said.
   ``Hence a woman, as well as a man, must understand her
`fulfillment' as a person, her dignity and vocation, on the basis
of these resources.''
   The pope links femininity to ``maternal'' characteristics such
as sensitivity to human beings and a sense of responsibility for
others.
   A woman's vocation, he said, lies in devoting herself to other
people _ either through motherhood or ``spiritual motherhood,'' in
which a woman chooses long-term virginity to focus on a mission of
service.
   The document emphasu~sus Christ's respect for women and says his
behavior showed he did not follow the norms of his times. Thus, the
pope argues, Christ was not affected by the traditions of his day
when he chose men as his top Apostles, but intended that only they
should fill that role.
   He added that Christ celebrated the Eucharist with men and that
the sacrament symbolizes the sacrifice men should make in marriage.
In the Catholic faith, the consecration of the Eucharist
commemorates Christ's giving of himself for the church.
   ``Christ, in instituting the Eucharist ... wished to express the
relationship between man and woman, between what is `feminine' and
what is `masculine,''' the pope wrote.
   Schotte said the arguments against women priests also appeared
to rule out women deacons _ a subject of intense interest in the
U.S. Catholic Church.
   In a draft pastoral letter issued last spring, the U.S. bishops
called for a study of making women deacons. Deacons are ordained
ministers who rank below priests.
   The Vatican is facing increasing pressure from women for a
greater role in the church, an issue that has been fueled by the
recent elevating of a female bishop in the Episcopal Church.
   Vatican officials said the pope issued his document now to
provide theological underpinning for church decisions in the coming
months on women.

   The FBI discriminates against Hispanics, a
federal judge ruled Friday, saying the agency is slow to promote
Hispanic agents and assigns them less-desirable jobs.
   U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton said the 311 Hispanic agents
who sued the FBI ``demonstrated a pattern and practice of
discrimination relating to conditions of employment and
promotions.''
   Bunton said the issue of damages will be decided in later
hearings, possibly beginning in late November.
   Attorneys for the agents said the decision could change
employment practices in government and private industry.
   ``The decision says discrimination exists in the Department of
Justice. If it exists there, it does in other places,'' said lawyer
Hugo Rodriguez.
   ``It's a landmark decision because discrimination against
Hispanics is pervasive,'' said Antonio Silva, another plaintiff
lawyer.
   An FBI spokesman said a bureau response would be issued later
Friday.
   The Hispanic agents won nearly all the points they set forth,
but the judge said they did not prove the FBI retaliated against
them for their involvement in the suit. Bunton, said, however,
there was evidence the bureau retaliated against the lead
plaintiff, Bernardo M. Perez.
   Perez, the No. 2 man in the El Paso FBI office, filed the suit
in January 1987, alleging the FBI discriminates against Hispanics
in promotion, discipline and assignments. He asked for $5 million
in damages and changes in FBI policies.
   ``Until I read the document, I was very apprehensive,'' Perez
said. ``I am very pleased. I am very happy. Justice does prevail in
the United States of America.''
   The FBI has 9,574 agents of which 437 or 4.5 percent are
Hispanic. Hispanics make up about 8 percent of the general U.S.
population.
   During a two-week non-jury trial in August, about 30 agents
testified that Hispanic agents are given less-desirable
assignments, are afforded less recognition for their successes and
are not promoted as quickly as non-Hispanics.
   The FBI rebutted those claims with testimony from the three
agents who work directly under FBI Director William Sessions, other
witnesses and statistical evidence.
   In his 98-page opinion, Bunton said he agreed with the Hispanic
agents' claims that they were usually sent to listen to
Spanish-language wiretaps, even if there were non-Hispanic agents
available who understood Spanish better.
   Noting that wiretaps are a hardship because of long shifts,
cramped quarters and long stays away from home, Bunton wrote:
``Hispanic agents suffer disparate treatment in the conditions of
their employment; and ... these conditions affect their promotional
opportunities in an adverse manner.''
   Bunton agreed with the plaintiffs' allegations that Hispanic
agents often are called off major cases to work on lesser cases
where they can use their Spanish-speaking ability, then are denied
credit for work on the cases they were taken away from.
   Bunton wrote that he understood the FBI needs Spanish-speaking
agents, but that the need for such agents does not ``justify
benefit and promotion systems which do not reward Hispanic agents
in a manner commensurate with their admitted contribution to the
bureau.''
   At news conference Friday afternoon, Rodriguez said Hispanic
employees from several government agencies and private corporations
have contacted him, seeking advice about alleged discrimination.

   The $15 million race between New Jersey Sen.
Frank Lautenberg and Republican Peter Dawkins has reached such a
level of nastiness that the challenger describes the contest as a
``barroom brawl.''
   In the past few weeks, Dawkins has put television commercials on
the air that brand Lautenberg as an extreme liberal in the
tradition of actress Jane Fonda and former Sen. George McGovern.
   Lautenberg has fired back with his own ads accusing Dawkins, a
Michigan native, of being a carpetbagger.
   ``This is going to be a tough, rock 'em-sock 'em 15 rounds. No
hold barred,'' Dawkins says. ``This is a barroom brawl.''
   The two men in the race come from widely differing backgrounds
and styles.
   Lautenberg, 64, made his fortune in the computer business and
won his first term in the Senate in 1982, coming from behind in the
race against Millicent Fenwick.
   Dawkins, 50, is a retired Army brigadier general, Rhodes
Scholar, with Hollywood good looks and a parade-ground presence.
   The two sides say they'll spend between $7 million and $8
million each, mainly buying expensive New York and Philadelphia
television time.
   While pre-Labor Day campaigning focused on issues, both
candidates have detoured in the final stretch of the campaign.
   Lautenberg has aired TV spots that accuse Dawkins of using New
Jersey as a ``political pit stop,'' and of exaggerating his
already-impressive resume. ``C'mon Pete, be real,'' is a Lautenberg
campaign slogan.
   Lautenberg, who co-founded and ran the worldwide Automatic Data
Processing Corp., has stood in the political shadow of fellow Sen.
Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who is touted every four years as
presidential stock.
   And because New Jersey, with no statewide newspaper or
television channel, is blanketed by the giant media markets of New
York and Philadelphia, Lautenberg has been frustrated in drawing
news media attention to himself. New York Mayor Edward Koch is a
more familar face to many New Jersey viewers than their junior
senator.
   Lautenberg insists he has done a good job for New Jersey, but
acknowledges not enough constituents connect his name with his
record.
   But, Lautenberg says, ``When they hear that I wrote the law to
put people who dump plastics in the ocean in jail, they love it.''
   Dawkins, despite arriving in the state just last year, has
gained the loyalty of most Republicans. However, he's been bruised
by some unflattering press and an insensitive gaffe in April.
   After he settled in the posh suburb of Rumson, N.J., Dawkins
confessed to reporters he'd rather be in Washington. ``I'd blow my
brains out if I had to live in a small town,'' he said.
   Once stiff, almost arrogant, Dawkins has begun to loosen up. He
is greeted as a star and delivers a practiced campaign speech that
blends pride in New Jersey with Lautenberg-bashing.
   Top New Jersey Republicans courted Dawkins away from Wall
Street, where he prospered after leaving the Army in 1983.
   Born in Michigan, and a childhood victim of polio, Dawkins was
an academic and athletic star at West Point, winning the 1959
Heisman Trophy. He studied at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and
earned a Ph.D. at Princeton. In a 24-year Army career, Dawkins was
a Vietnam hero and, at 43, an unusually young brigadier general.
   Yet, Lautenberg and his aides have repeatedly accused Dawkins of
gilding the lily.
   The challenger's campaign was caught adverstising Dawkins as
wounded in Vietnam, which he was not. Early campaign literature
said Dawkins served two tours in the Asian conflict. He served one
full tour, and returned for a few months in a non-combat role.
   Dawkins corrected the exaggerations himself.
   Like Dawkins, Lautenberg has an impressive background.
   Raised in poverty, he served in the Army in World War II and
went to college on the G.I. bill. He co-founded the ADP Corp. and,
in 30 years, amassed a fortune estimated near $40 million.

   President Reagan, trying to score political
points for George Bush in the Midwest, said Friday their
administration has worked to recover ``bedrock values'' after
taking the White House from the Democrats.
   ``There really are only two things the liberals don't understand
_ the things that change and the things that don't,'' Reagan told
some 1,500 people gathered for lunch at Wozniak's Casino, a Polish
social club.
   Noting that he once was a Democrat, the president told the crowd
that the present leadership of the party is out of step with the
rank-and-file.
   ``The liberals may try to mouth some of our words, but when they
talk about `values' and `family' they mean something very
different,'' he said.
   Reagan's trip to Chicago was aimed at helping Bush with
conservative-minded Democrats and independent voters in ethnic
communities _ many of whose votes Reagan and Bush won while
carrying Illinois in 1980 and 1984.
   The president said that the Republican Party represented the
best hopes of people seeking liberation of Eastern European nations.
   He called the Munich Pact in 1938 ``the naive appeasement that
brought us the great nightmare of this century _ the Second World
War.''
   ``The sad lesson is that to be weak is to invite war,'' he said,
``and George Bush and I will not rest until freedom is restored to
all the peoples of Eastern Europe.''
   Without mentioning the name of Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis, Reagan suggested that Bush had fared better than
the Massachusetts governor in last Sunday's nationally televised
debate.
   Reagan, taking a new slap at Dukakis' membership in the American
Civil Liberties Union, said, ``You know, after the debate, I had to
say, `Isn't that just like an ACLU member. He didn't have a prayer
when he needed one.''
   ``Over the last eight years, America has begun a great
enterprise of resurrection,'' he said. ``We have worked to recover
the bedrock values that you and most Americans never departed
from.''
   ``We have rebuilt our defenses, our country is at peace, our
economy is strong and our future is bright.''

   In remarks prepared for delivery at a $250-per-plate fund-raiser
later, Reagan called Bush ``one of the finest men I have ever
known.''
   ``We've all seen what a brilliant job he's done in the past _
and I can promise you he's going to do an even better job in the
future.''
   Reagan criticized former President Carter's administration,
which preceded his own, and said, ``Today we have peace and
prosperity, and the liberals are trying to pretend those economic
and foreign policy nightmares never happened.''

   He also attended a private reception for 80 couples who donated
at least $10,000 a couple to GOP coffers.
   He departed from his announced schedule to throw out the first
ball at the Chicago Cubs-Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game at
Wrigley Field. Reagan once did radio broadcast re-creations of Cubs
games on stations in Davenport and Des Moines, Iowa.

   While Americans rejoice in the safe launch
of space shuttle Discovery, Tim Whiting is getting tired of
answering his telephone.
   Whiting, owner of NAPA Auto Supply in Coloma, has a toll free
number, 1-800-999-NAPA, which is being confused with a 900 number
for shuttle news.
   The number to call to hear shuttle-to-ground conversation and
periodic updates on the mission is 1-900-909-NASA.
   Apparently some radio stations were incorrectly promoting
1-900-999-NASA as the space hotline number. That is close to
Whiting's number, since both NAPA and NASA translate on a telephone
into the numerals 6272.
   Whiting said he began receiving the strange phone calls even
before the Thursday morning launch and about 30 had come in by the
time he closed his store.
   Whiting called his MCI to see if his 800 number could be
disconnected for the day. He was told a change in the number would
take two weeks.
   In the meantime, he will have to pay for the incorrect,
toll-free calls.

<HEAD>ACLU Advertises To Defend Its Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, attacked
by Vice President George Bush as the incarnation of ideas that
voters loathe, will embark on a $250,000 effort to tell Americans
its only cause is the Bill of Rights.
   Dan Goldberg, chairman of the ACLU Foundation of Southern
California, announced the campaign Thursday at a news conference
and played two commercial taped for the organization by actor Burt
Lancaster, who tells viewers: ``I have a confession to make. I'm a
card-carrying member of the ACLU.''
   The reference to being a ``card-carrying member'' is the same
one Bush has used to describe Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis up
to and including Sunday's nationally televised debate. Bush claimed
Dukakis' ACLU membership showed how out of touch he was with
Americans.
   Dukakis did not defend the organization during the debate, and
the day afterward his campaign issued a list of ACLU positions with
which he disagrees.
   Other commercials for the 68-year-old ACLU will be made next
week by Jill Eikenberry and Michael Tucker, the husband-and-wife
actors who portray married lawyers on the ``L.A. Law'' television
series.
   Goldberg, a talent manager whose previous battles have included
thwarting the movement to rate records according to their lyric
content, said people associate the ACLU with the often-unpopular
causes and groups it defends.
   He said the campaign is designed to show Americans that ``our
one client is the Bill of Rights.'' He said the defense of
Constitutional principles such as separation of church and state,
the rights of groups to speak and march and the rights of accused
people leads the ACLU to represent such groups as the Ku Klux Klan
and the Communist Party.
   The television commercials are expected to quickly use up the
initial $30,000 budget for time purchases in Southern California,
with 18 spots to be seen locally on Cable News Network and three on
``The CBS Morning News.''
   The ACLU Southern California Foundation, the organization's
largest, also has launched a letter campaign to its 25,000 members
seeking $250,000 for additional advertising money.
   The ads will be made available to the ACLU's 50 other
foundations.
   Goldberg said the idea for an advertising campaign actually
began after the Republican National Convention in August when Pat
Robertson attacked the ACLU during an address.

<HEAD>Steps Seen Likely to Prevent Future Buildup of Dead Trees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An interagency review committee probably will
recommend steps in Yellowstone National Park to prevent the
century-long buildup of dead trees that made this summer's fires so
destructive, Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel said Thursday.
   And the chief ranger of the National Park Service said
controlled burning hasn't been done before in Yellowstone because
the predominant species there, lodgepole pine, is almost impossible
to burn under control.
   Hodel told two Senate subcommittees that he and Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng on Monday named members of a panel of
experts to make recommendations for changes in firefighting
policies by Dec. 15. The panel was instructed to consult other
experts in universities, state governments and other places outside
the federal establishment.
   Lyng's department controls the Forest Service, the agency with
the dominant role in fighting most fires on government land.
Hodel's department is in charge of the National Park Service, which
runs Yellowstone.
   ``I would expect them to come back with a recommended means of
trying to reduce the fuel. I don't think anybody can tell me what
that will be,'' Hodel told the agriculture, nutrition and forest
subcommittee of the Agriculture Committee and the public lands and
parks subcommittee of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
   The hearing was called to ventilate complaints of Western
senators that the ``let it burn'' policy of the Park Service in
effect since 1972 had led to a disaster for the park.
   Although other parks have employed controlled burns to
regenerate the land, they had never been used in Yellowstone
despite the buildup of dead trees from almost a century of trying
to put out every fire.
   Walt Dabney, the chief ranger, said, ``The only time that
material (lodgepole pine) will burn successfully is when it's very,
very dry'' and there are winds to move the fire along.
   ``To light a fire when it's dry and windy, you're in the same
situation we were in this year. It's very hard to control,'' he
testified.
   Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said his agency
would plant new trees where needed, but William Penn Mott, director
of the Park Service, said Yellowstone plantings would be limited to
native grasses and wildflowers along the roads and along trout
streams if necessary to hold back erosion from bare ground.
   Lodgepole pine needs fire to burst cones and throw seeds on the
ground. Seed counts, Mott said, show 50,000 per acre _ more than
one per square foot _ where the hottest fires burned and up to a
million per acre elsewhere.
   ``We don't need seeds,'' Mott said.
   In mid-July, the park service decided to fight all the fires in
Yellowstone _ some of which had entered from Forest Service land
outside the park. Hodel confirmed the decision during a visit there
July 22.
   Some senators expressed skepticism that the Park Service really
was trying to put out the fires, and Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont.,
chairing the hearing, asked, ``Was what Secretary Hodel wanted
done, done?''
   Hodel said his conversations with firefighters on another visit
in September led him to conclude his wishes were not being
sabotaged. Many of the people he talked with were not from the Park
Service but experts from other agencies, and ``They were making the
best decisions they could make.''
   Senators also expressed skepticism that the Park Service could
assess the spring as normal or wetter than normal when nearby
counties were crying for drought relief, but Hodel said such data
``may well have lulled us into a false sense of security.'' He said
he was awaiting the compilation of a detailed chronology to see
``when the extra dry conditions in Yellowstone became visible.''
   Senators also expressed dismay that publicity about the fires
would keep tourists away next year, and Hodel said the park was
``very much worth viewing. ... Fully one-half of the park has not
been touched and fully one-half of the area that has been touched
very shortly will appear not to have been.''
   Although the area suffered economically, said Sen. Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo., ``Probably more important, we suffered
emotionally.''

<HEAD>Democrats Push for One Bill on Child Care, Pornography, Parental
Leave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats laid down an election-season
challenge to the GOP on Thursday by moving to combine a $2.5
billion child care initiative with a hybrid anti-pornography and
parental leave bill.
   ``Everybody claims they want to do something'' for families,
said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., sponsor of two of the three
measures. ``Here's the chance.''
   Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., made the move after his
Republican counterpart, Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, said he
could offer no deal to limit amendments or schedule a vote on the
pornography-leave bill.
   The leave component, sponsored by Dodd, requires businesses with
more than 50 employees to give workers at least 10 weeks of leave
to cope with a newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill child or a
worker's own serious illness.
   Some of the most adamant opponents of the leave bill worked
vigorously this week to add to it a measure strengthening laws and
penalties against child pornography and obscenity. That part was
sponsored by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   The child care section would be modeled on the Act for Better
Child Care Services, a Democratic initiative centered on subsidies
to help families pay for day care. Dodd was the sponsor.
   Dodd said he and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a leading
conservative player in the child care arena, had agreed on a
compromise authorizing the same amount of money. Federal staff,
health and safety standards still would be required of centers and
homes receiving federal money, but governors could seek temporary
variances for counties or other parts of their states having
trouble with compliance.
   A separate tax provision would be proposed either on the floor
or as part of a tax technical corrections bill, Dodd said. He said
it would involve the earned income tax credit, but declined to give
details.
   Dodd labeled the children's package the ``Thurmond-Hatch-Dodd''
proposal.
   ``While this is a little cumbersome, I admit, and we're running
out of time, I admit, I don't think we're that far apart,'' Dodd
said.
   Dole, in his floor exchange with Byrd, labeled the trio of bills
``a total political agenda'' and said senators should be spending
their time on tax corrections and an anti-drug bill _ ``issues that
affect the public interest, not the political interest.''
   Dole said the Republicans might offer a motion to kill or
indefinitely postpone a vote on Byrd's proposal, which involves
sending the leave-pornography bill back to committee to be fused
with Dodd-Hatch child care compromise and swiftly returned to the
floor.
   If that happens, Dodd said, ``they bear the responsibility of
this package of legislation dying in this Congress.''

   An eccentric scholar serving a three-year
sentence for trying to sell valuable letters from government
libraries was convicted Thursday of possessing a gun and drugs
found in safety deposit boxes.
   A U.S. District Court jury convicted Charles Merrill Mount on a
felony charge of illegally possessing a .32-caliber pistol and two
misdemeanor counts of possessing more than 1,000 barbiturates.
   Mount, already serving a three-year sentence for trying to sell
valuable letters to a Boston bookstore, could receive up to five
years imprisonment for the weapons conviction and one-year terms
for each of the two drug possession counts.
   Jurors, who deliberated nearly four hours following the two-day
trial, declined to convict Mount of the more serious charges of
felony possession with intent to distribute prescription drugs.
   Mount, the son of a Brooklyn physician who affects a British
accent and carries a cane in the style of an Edwardian gentleman,
contended that he kept the pills to prove that his late father was
a drug addict.
   He testified that pills were to be used as evidence in court to
contest the will in which his father, Dr. Abraham Suchow, had
disinherited him.
   Mount had been convicted in 1982 of making threatening telephone
calls to his mother during the bitter court fight over his father's
will.
   Mount, who was born Seymour Suchow, also was convicted in 1984
of filing a false passport application.
   On May 24, Mount was sentenced in Boston to three years
imprisonment for transporting stolen documents, including letters
by Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill, that belonged to the
Library of Congress and the National Archives.
   Mount, 60, was arrested Aug. 13, 1987, while trying to sell
letters and papars signed by Lincoln and several Civil War generals
to Goodspeed's Bookshop in Boston.
   He is awaiting trial in Washington on 17 additional counts of
receipt of stolen property stemming from the hundreds of Civil War
documents the FBI said were found in two safety deposit boxes Mount
kept under assumed names.
   It was in those boxes, searched following Mount's arrest in
Boston, that agents found the barbiturates and the pistol.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. did not schedule a
sentencing date for Mount on the gun and drug convictions.
   Robinson also refused a request by defense attorney David H.
Williams to order the government to turn over a painting that Mount
had deeded to the law firm to help pay legal expenses.
   Assistant District Attorney Scott L. Fredericksen said the
painting and other items seized last year from Mount's Capitol Hill
apartment were being examined by the FBI as part of its continuing
investigation.
   Fredericksen told the judge there was evidence that Mount, an
accomplished portrait painter and art historian, had painted the
picture himself, forged Claude Monet's signature and tried to sell
it as an original of the famous French artist.
   An art expert had identified the Monet signature as a forgery,
Fredericksen said.
   Mount, a former Guggenheim fellow, is the author of biographies
of American painters John Singer Sargent, Gilbert Stuart and Monet.
   According to the FBI, Mount frequented the manuscript collection
at the Library of Congress and the Archives, where he gained access
to valuable documents.

   The government Thursday sued a former U.S.
attorney in Cleveland for failing to report loans on a financial
disclosure form while he was a federal prosecutor.
   The Justice Department complaint in U.S. District Court in
Cleveland seeks $20,000 in civil penalties from J. William Petro
for alleged violations of the financial disclosure provisions of
the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.
   Petro was fired as a federal prosecutor in 1984 amid a Justice
Department probe of his activities and eventually was convicted of
disclosing the contents of a sealed indictment.
   The suit says Petro submitted a disclosure form in October 1981
reporting no liabilities to creditors when a man named Carl
Glickman had supplied Petro with a $15,000 loan the previous month.
   The complaint says an individual identified only as Lozick
loaned Petro $120,000 in 1982, but that the U.S. attorney didn't
report either that obligation or the Glickman loan on his
disclosure form for that year.
   In addition, the government says Petro failed to report the
Glickman or Lozick obligations or an additional $15,000 in loans
from Lozick for 1983; nor did he report the Glickman loan on an
amended form for 1983.
   President Reagan on Oct. 3, 1984, ordered that Petro be
dismissed immediately as U.S. attorney in Cleveland at a time when
the Justice Department was investigating Petro in connection with
the possible leaking of information concerning a criminal
investigation.
   A federal court jury on March 7, 1985, in Baton Rouge, La.,
convicted Petro of criminal contempt for disclosing the contents of
a sealed indictment.
   Cleveland businessman Howard Schulman had a conversation with
Petro about the indictment and then Schulman told details to one of
the defendants, a close friend, Stanley Moss.
   Moss and several others were charged in the indictment with
fraud involving the alleged sale of counterfeit merchandise.
   Petro, then 44, testified he didn't know the indictment was
sealed when he revealed its contents.
   A man who answered the telephone at the Cleveland address listed
in the complaint denied that he was the Petro named in the suit and
said no such person lived at that address.
   In an unrelated matter, the government also announced it is
suing an Alaska man under the Ethics in Government Act for
allegedly neglecting until this year to file a federal financial
disclosure form in connection with his candidacy in 1986 for the
U.S. Senate.
   The government has brought a total of four civil suits under the
ethics act. The other two were against Constance Hansen, the wife
of former U.S. Rep. George Hansen, and Steve Tarver, a Republican
candidate from Wyoming running for the U.S. Senate. Both Mrs.
Hansen and Tarver paid civil penalties in connection with financial
disclosure requirements. Mrs. Hansen was a government employee as
well as a congressional candidate.

<HEAD>First Sex Change Operation in Cuba Performed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Cuban woman is ``working normally and has
stabilized emotionally'' after undergoing the Communist-ruled
nation's first sex change operation, the Cuban news agency Prensa
Latina reported Friday.
   ``For the first time an individual considered to be a man has
changed his sex and become a woman,'' Prensa Latina said in a
dispatch monitored in Mexico City.
   It said the afternoon daily newspaper Rebel Youth disclosed the
operation on Friday but did not identify the woman or say when the
surgery took place. The operation was performed by a team of
surgeons led by Julio Cesar Morales Concepcion at a hospital in the
capital, Havana.
   ``The patient, since her infancy, presented serious
psychological disturbances that weren't conveniently interpreted,''
Rebel Youth quoted Morales Concepcion as saying.
   ``Out of ignorance, neither her relatives nor society was aware
of this pathological and scientific phenomenon so they could not
direct someone who wanted to change her sex,'' Morales Concepcion
said.
   The patient contacted a national sex education group, which
referred her to the surgery team. It performed the operation ``with
a technique that has been well-established in Denmark, Sweden,
Spain and the United States,'' the report said.
   Rebel Youth quoted Morales Concepcion as saying the case ``is
not a matter of a homosexual but a truly humanitarian case.''
   Critics have accused the government of President Fidel Castro of
persecuting homosexuals in Cuba and of sending homosexuals to work
camps in the 1960s and 1970s. Castro took power in 1959 in a
revolution that ousted dictator Fulgencio Batista.
   The woman ``can be found working normally and has stabilized
emotionally in absolute form,'' Rebel Youth said.

<TEXT>
   Pediatric nurse Ann Green, who said she killed
two of her babies and tried to kill a third because she was
depressed after childbirth, was found innocent of murder and
attempted murder Friday because of insanity.
   Mrs. Green, 43, slumped forward at the defense table and her
lawyer, Michael Dowd, hugged her as jury foreman Andrew Kessler
pronounced the verdict. Her 54-year-old husband, Larry, wept.
   State Supreme Court Justice Stephen Crane let Mrs. Green remain
free in $125,000 bail and directed her to undergo psychiatric
evaluation within 30 days. He scheduled a hearing on the
psychiatric report for Oct. 28.
   ``I know I need help,'' Mrs. Green said after the verdict, ``and
I'll continue to seek it. I'll just take it one day at a time.''
   Crane, after hearing the psychiatric report, may commit Mrs.
Green for treatment, or if she is not considered dangerous, release
her from custody.
   Larry Green, a former building superintendent who says he is
dying of cancer, said he and his wife had come through ``three
years of hell.'' But because the jury was ``intelligent'' and
``merciful,'' he said, ``we have just been delivered from a
terrible ordeal.''
   Mrs. Green admitted she smothered two of her babies in 1980 and
1982 by putting pillows over their faces. She said she tried to
kill a third the same way in 1985 but a neighbor, also a pediatric
nurse, resuscitated the infant. That child, a boy, lives with
relatives.
   Mrs. Green testified that when she smothered the infants, it
always seemed that someone else was doing it. ``I was not fully
aware of what happened to my babies or why,'' she said.
   The jury got the case around 4 p.m. Thursday after hearing the
prosecution say Mrs. Green, contrary to defense claims, was
criminally responsible for her children's deaths. Kessler, a
34-year-old researcher and Russian language expert explained the
jury's verdict.
   ``The overriding feeling,'' he said, ``was that the
prosecution's experts were not extremely credible and did not seem
to have a thorough familiarity with Mrs. Green's history so as to
win our trust.''
   Assistant District Attorney Marybeth Richroath charged that Mrs.
Green smothered her infants when they were just days old because
they annoyed her with their crying.
   The prosecutor said the defendant was fully aware of what she
was doing and had taken steps to conceal her actions.
   Mrs. Richroath said Mrs. Green lied to her husband and doctors
about what happened to the babies, and said she sought psychiatric
help only after a physician said he suspected foul play in the near
death of her third child.

<HEAD>Hungarian Council Approves Amnesty In 1956 Uprising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The presidential council passed a broad
amnesty on Friday for Hungarians imprisoned for taking part in this
country's 1956 anti-communist uprising, the official MTI news
agency said.
   Government spokesman Gyoergy Marosan said that under the amnesty
provision, the cases will be erased from individual files and
people involved will be without a criminal record, enabling them to
receive passports to travel abroad.
   He had announced the amnesty proposal Sept. 7.
   MTI said the presidential council, elected by Parliament and
exercises the functions of Parliament between quarterly sessions,
passed at its Friday meeting a statutory provision on granting
pardons to those convicted of crimes between Oct. 23, 1956 and May
1, 1957.
   The revolt began Oct. 23, 1956, with mass demonstrations for a
new government and demands that Soviet troops leave Hungary. On
Nov. 4, 200,000 Soviet troops and 2,500 tanks struck at Budapest to
put down the uprising.
   The amnesty covers those sentenced to prison for crimes against
the state or for ``counter-revolutionary activities'' and people
whose death penalty was commuted to imprisonment, MTI said.
   The report said the amnesty does not extend to those convicted
of high treason or espionage, or those who, in ``cumulation of
offenses, committed homicide, robbery, and caused public danger.''
   The minister of justice, however, would look into the cases of
those who were excluded and in ``justified cases'' could ask the
presidential council to grant individual pardons until Nov. 30,
1988, MTI said.

<HEAD>Judge: President Can't Block Humanitarian Aid to Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAREDO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president has no authority to prohibit
humanitarian aid to foreign countries, a federal judge said in a
ruling supporting a group that bucked the government and took
vehicles to Nicaragua.
   The Veterans Peace Convoy filed suit while it fought with the
government over plans to take vehicles filled with donated goods to
Nicaragua.
   The group eventually was able to take 30 of the group's 38
vehicles across the border at Laredo in July. Most of the vehicles
are in Nicaragua.
   U.S. District Judge George P. Kazen's ruling, issued Friday,
limits the scope of the International Emergency Economic Powers
Act, the basis for the Reagan administration's economic embargo of
Nicaragua.
   The act contains an exemption for humanitarian aid. The Reagan
administration had been interpreting it on a case-by-case basis,
the court said, and refusing to allow export of certain items
including cars and trucks.
   Kazen's ruling said because of the exemption in the Economic
Powers Act, the president has no authority to regulate or prohibit
U.S. citizens' donations to foreign countries ``which the donor
intends to be used to relieve human suffering.''
   Specifically, the Foreign Assets Control Office, part of the
Treasury Department, cannot require donors to get licenses before
exporting such aid, Kazen said. The act was cited when the office
temporarily barred the veterans' donation of vehicles to Nicaraguan
schools, hospitals and churches.
   Plaintiffs in the case said the ruling clears the way for
further aid to Nicaragua.
   ``We consider it an important victory. We actually got a much
broader ruling than we had expected,'' said Tom Hansen, former
coordinator of Veterans for Peace.
   Hansen last week joined Pastors for Peace, a Detroit-based group
which hopes to send a similar convoy to Nicaragua in 1989. Donating
to Nicaraguan groups will be much easier now that U.S. citizens
don't have to worry about getting licenses, he said in a telephone
interview.
   A Treasury Department spokesman, who spoke on condition he not
be named, said, ``We have not seen the decision yet. It will be
reviewed by the Treasury and Justice departments.'' He declined
further comment.
   The Veterans Peace Convoy collected donations in 100 cities in
42 states last spring before converging in Laredo. Ten hours before
the veterans' planned crossing into Mexico, U.S. Customs notified
them they couldn't go, Hansen said. Four of the vehicles were
confiscated.
   When the case came to trial the government argued there was no
reason to hear it, because the vehicles had been allowed to cross
and the impounded ones had been returned to the owners.
   Kazen said the plaintiffs' vehicles could be subject to seizure
in the future. He also noted the plaintiffs are under continuing
threat of criminal and civil prosecution.
   Justice Department spokesman Brad Marman had no immediate
response Friday when asked what government policy would be in light
of the decision, other than to say the department always abides by
court decisions. He said Justice officials had not seen the ruling.

   Greek Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou underwent open-heart surgery Friday, and a Greek Embassy
spokesman said ``Everything is fine.''
   Dr. Nicholas Papadakis, the Greek Embassy press attache, added:
``The operation was successful.''
   Greek officials at the hospital said a team headed by Magdi
Yacoub, Britain's top heart surgeon, performed the six-hour
operation on the 69-year-old Socialist prime minister at Harefield
Hospital north of London.
   The prime minister's four children and his girlfriend, airline
stewardess Dimitra Liani, 34, were at the hospital throughout the
surgery.
   Papandreou's condition was listed as satisfactory, Vasilis
Kapetanyannis, a Greek Embassy press officer at the hospital, said
late Friday night.
   Shortly after the operation, hospital general manager David
Thomson told reporters that Papandreou ``underwent an operation for
replacement of his aortic valve using a human valve. This was
combined with insertion of three bypass grafts and the clearing of
the diseased coronary artery, to improve the heart function.''
   ``The team of doctors who performed the operation is pleased
with his progress so far,'' Thomson said.
   In keeping with medical practice in Britain, the name of the
donor of the heart valve was not revealed.
   In Athens, state-run television interrupted evening programs
with a special news bulletin to say surgery was a success and that
the prime minister's doctors ``are absolutely satisfied.''
   Papandreou, head of the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement
and president of the 12-nation European Economic Community, flew to
London Aug. 25 after his heart condition suddenly worsened. Greece
does not have a hospital where a complex open-heart operation like
his could be performed.
   He underwent pre-surgical treatment at Harefield for a narrowing
of the aorta, the main blood vessel carrying blood from the heart.
   Greek officials said the main operation was delayed a month to
clear a liver disorder linked to the heart problem.
   Waiting in a hospital corridor away from the news media were his
four adult children, several government ministers and Ms. Liani,
whose public appearances walking hand-in-hand with Papandreou have
become a hot issue in the Greek press.
   After Papandreou arrived in Britain, the Greek government
announced he would divorce Margaret Papandreou, his American-born
wife of 37 years, prompting speculation that he planned to marry
Ms. Liani.
   Mrs. Papandreou is not in London, according to the embassy.
   Papandreou's relationship with Ms. Liani, a stewardess for
Olympic Airways, the national airline, became public a year ago
when they were seen together on an Aegean island.
   Papandreou came to power in 1981 at the head of his Panhellenic
Socialist Movement and won a second four-year term at national
elections held in 1985.
   He is the dominant personality in Greek politics and reserves
most decision-making for himself. His four-week absence from Athens
has markedly slowed government activity according to socialist
officials.
   Opposition conservatives from the New Democracy party complain
Papandreou's refusal to appoint a stand-in while he's away is
unconstitutional and has left a power vacuum.
   His deputies are Defense Minister Yiannis Haralambopoulos, who
handles ceremonial occasions, and Justice Minister Menios
Koutsogiorgos, who supervises day-to-day running of the government.
Both have deputy premier status.
   But during his hospitalization, Papandreou has stayed in close
touch with his Cabinet by telephone and telefax and senior Cabinet
ministers have flown to London to get instructions.

<HEAD>Seattle Times Breaks Republican Tradition To Endorse Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seattle Times is breaking a virtually
rock-solid tradition of supporting Republican presidential
candidates and endorsing Democrat Michael Dukakis this year.
   The endorsement, announced Friday, said that with five weeks
left before the election Nov. 8, the Massachusetts governor had
shown ``a broader, deeper understanding of the economies of the
states and nation.''
   The editorial endorsing Dukakis will appear in the newspaper's
Sunday editions.
   ``Gov. Michael Dukakis is conspicuously the best choice to lead
America as its president through the coming four years,'' the
editorial said.
   Vice President George Bush must share responsibility with
President Reagan for ``the potentially catastrophic federal deficit
... (and) the widening financial gap between the well-off who've
gained handsomely and the tens of millions of middle-class and poor
Americans who are today relatively worse off,'' the editorial said.
   Dukakis also was chosen on the basis of his support for
education, civil rights, defense, clean government and choice of a
running mate.
   ``Bush wraps himself in the flag, exploits emotions surrounding
the issue of abortion, casts doubt on the patriotism of his
opponent and attacks the American Civil Liberties Union,'' the
editorial said.
   ``These tactics suggest that Bush is a small man, fearfully
marching backward toward the 1940s, rather than being a leader who
can inspire America and its citizens to higher thoughts and deeds.''
   The endorsement announcement said a search of internal Times
files going back to 1920 showed that the only time the larger of
the city's two daily papers failed to support a Republican for
president was in 1964, when neither Republican Barry Goldwater nor
Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson was endorsed.

<TEXT>
   The House on Friday attached a strong
anti-abortion amendment and a measure allowing Georgetown
University to deny certain rights to gay groups to the District of
Columbia appropriations bill, prompting a threat by city officials
to shut down their government.
   In approving the city's $3.2 billion fiscal year 1989 budget,
the House added an amendment that would freeze the $530 million
federal payment for the District's budget and prevent the city from
spending its own money if Medicaid-funded abortions are performed
on women whose lives are not threatened.
   The House bill, still to be considered by the Senate, also would
allow Georgetown University to go back on its agreement to allow
gay student associations to meet on campus and apply for student
government funds.
   The Roman Catholic school had reached an agreement with the gay
groups in March after the District of Columbia Superior Court and
Court of Appeals upheld a finding by the city's human rights office
that Georgetown was discriminating against gay groups. Georgetown
officials have said that they will not go back on their agreement
with the student groups, regardless of what Congress decides.
   Del. Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., angered by the intrusion into
local affairs, said he would encourage city officials to disobey
the abortion-funding prohibition to trigger a congressionally
mandated shutdown of city government. Such a move would leave
Congress with the responsibility of governing the nation's capital.
   ``You will forgive me, having respected you for 18 years, if I
suggest to my mayor and people that work for this (city) government
that maybe it's time to end this facade,'' a tearful Fauntroy told
his House colleagues in a meeting where the final touches were put
on the budget. ``If Congress wants to decide every little detail,
maybe it's time to do that.''
   David Clarke, chairman of the District of Columbia Council,
concurred with Fauntroy, saying, ``I believe it is time for the
people of the District of Columbia to take to the streets to defend
their constitutional rights.''
   The abortion measure, offered by Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif.,
toughens current legislation, which allows the city to use locally
generated funds for abortions, and restricts federal funds for use
by rape and incest victims, women suffering through ectopic
pregnancies, or when the mother's life is threatened.

<TEXT>
   About 1,500 Cubans requested meetings with a U.N.
human rights delegation that returned from Cuba this week, many of
them complaining that they were barred from leaving the country, an
official said Friday.
   The delegation, which stayed in Cuba for 10 days, was the first
of its kind to visit the Caribbean island nation since President
Fidel Castro came to power in 1959.
   The six-member team only had time to meet with 86 of the 1,500
Cubans who requested meetings, delegation chairman Alioune Sene of
Senegal told a news conference.
   He said the 86 represented a cross-section of the different
allegations of human rights abuses that the group received.
   The allegations included ``bad treatment,'' temporary
disappearances, illegal and arbitrary detention and lack of
religious freedom, Sene said.
   He said ``a good part'' of the total 1,500 written requests were
from people who said they were barred from emigrating. Many wanted
to join family members living in other countries, but some said
they would go ``anywhere,'' Sene said.
   He declined to comment on any specific cases.
   In addition to Sene, the delegation consisted of members of the
U.N. Human Rights Commission from Bulgaria, Colombia, Ireland,
Nigeria and the Philippines.
   The group visited Cuba Sept. 16-26 on a mandate from the
commission, which last March accepted an invitation from Castro to
visit the island and investigate the human rights situation.
   The invitation followed a two-year effort by the United States
to have Cuba put on the commission's agenda.
   The United States and international organizations including
Amnesty International have cited reports of human rights violations
in Cuba, including torture and mistreatment of political prisoners.
Cuba has denied the allegations.
   The delegation will present its report to next year's
commission, which opens in February, Sene said. He declined to go
into the group's conclusions.
   In answer to a question, Sene said some Cuban prisoners who met
with the group said they had been threatened because of their wish
to meet with the human rights delegates.
   But Sene said the Cuban government had assued the delegation
that all citizens could meet freely with the panel without fearing
reprisals after the group left Cuba.
   Sene said his group visited three prisons and a psychiatric
hospital.
   The group also met with Castro and other Cuban officials, as
well as private citizens, church officials and non-governmental
organizations, including the Cuban Human Rights Commission.

<TEXT>
   Olympics fans who were watching television
Friday night were exposed to the newest Michael Dukakis ad, which
suggested that Republican rival George Bush was wrapping himself in
the American flag because he lacked a real issue with which to
attract voters.
   The 30-second ad on NBC consisted of a group of actors posing as
George Bush's aides trying to plot out a campaign strategy.
Entitled ``The Packaging of George Bush,'' the ad begins with one
of the aides mentioning Democrat Dukakis' health insurance plan for
the 37 million Americans who lack coverage.
   ``It's going to go over real well with the middle class,''
another voice says. ``We've got enough problems with the middle
class.''
   When one aide asks ``So, what does Bush do?'' another answers,
``Wraps himself up in the American flag.'' ``That again?'' another
asks. ``Get out the flag, boys'' another says.
   The ad concludes with the slogan: ``They'd like to sell you the
package. Wouldn't you rather choose a president?''
   The Dukakis headquarters in Boston refused earlier Friday to
supply a script and information on the ad.

   Michael Dukakis and George Bush raided each other's home states
on Friday, Dukakis accusing his Republican rival of pursuing an
agricultural policy of ``the fewer farmers the better'' and Bush
swooping into Massachusetts to collect more endorsements from
police who serve under the Democrat.
   Dukakis told a farm rally in Idalou, a small community in Bush's
adopted state of Texas, that the vice president ``doesn't see the
pain in rural America.'' He vowed to devote $100 million for
investment in rural areas if elected.
   Campaigning in Texas at a time when polls show him trailing, the
Democratic presidential candidate asserted that some 250,000 farm
families have left the land since Bush became vice president in
1981.
   Standing in front of a cattle pen on a dusty family farm,
Dukakis claimed Reagan administration farm policies had idled
farmland and depressed farm prices.
   ``My friends, Mr. Bush's farm policy can be summed up in just
five words: the fewer farmers the better,'' the Massachusetts
governor said. ``And his rural development policy can be summed up
in two words: Tough luck.''
   Dukakis also poked fun at Bush, whose legal Texas residence is a
hotel room in Houston. ``Since I rented a hotel room in Dallas last
night, I guess I qualify as a Texan,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis received an unexpected newspaper endorsement as well.
The Seattle Times, which almost always endorses Republicans,
announced Friday that it would carry an editorial Sunday supporting
Dukakis.
   The editorial said Bush must share responsibility with President
Reagan for ``the potentially catastrophic federal deficit ... (and)
the widening financial gap between the well-off who've gained
handsomely and the tens of millions of middle-class and poor
Americans who are today relatively worse off.''
   The Dukakis campaign also aired a new, 30-second ad Friday night
during NBC's coverage of the Olympics. The ad, called ``The
Packaging of George Bush,'' showed actors portraying Bush aides who
say he must wrap himself in the American flag because he has no
issue that appeals to the middle class.
   
   
   
   
   And in an adver
   
   Bush, meanwhile, made the second raid of Dukakis' home turf in a
week to pick up police endorsements. Eight days after he won the
backing of the Boston Police Patrolman's Association, the vice
president on Friday made a hasty schedule change to accept the
endorsement in Springfield, Mass., of two municipal police unions.
   Bush told them the Massachusetts prison furlough program was ``a
national disgrace.''
   Speaking earlier in Paterson, N.J., where he also received
police endorsements, Bush accused Dukakis of having a ``revolving
door program for murderers who have not even served enough time for
parole.''
   The two references were to a favorite Bush target: a furlough
program that allowed passes for first-degree murderers. The program
was later amended, but not until after one of the prisoners escaped
while on furlough and raped a Maryland woman.
   Dukakis supporters sought to counter Bush's latest endorsements
with a news conference in Hartford, Conn., where the Hartford
Police Union endorsed Dukakis.
   Yet more national polls weighed in with tossup results. A Gallup
survey of 1,020 registered voters indicated Bush was the choice of
47 percent, Dukakis 42 percent. The survey, conducted Tuesday and
Wednesday, had a 3 percent margin of error.
   A Los Angeles Times poll conducted by calling back voters who
had been interviewed just before and then just after the Sunday's
presidential debate found the race still a tie, at 45-45 percent.
It had been 46-46 Sunday.
   The new callback poll, conducted Thursday, had 622 respondents
and a five-point margin of error.
   President Reagan, meanwhile, took a cue from Bush's attacks on
Dukakis for his membership in the American Civil Liberties Union,
portraying the Democratic contender as ``liberal, liberal,
liberal.''
   Speaking to an audience of 1,200 at a Polish social hall in
southwest Chicago, the president suggested that Dukakis'
performance in last Sunday's debate was ``just like an ACLU member:
he didn't have a prayer when he needed one.''
   Questioning the positions of the ACLU, Reagan added, ``You
recall a few years back, political figures had to disassociate
themselves from groups on the right with far-out views. Isn't it
now time for responsible people to do the same thing with far-out
groups on the left?''
   Just days before the nationally-televised vice presidential
debate in Omaha, Neb., Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said Bush's
``record on education is as empty as Dan Quayle's resume.''
   The Democratic vice presidential made the comments in prepared
remarks accepting the National Education Association's endorsement
of the Democratic ticket.
   Before heading to Washington, D.C., to claim the endorsement,
Bentsen told a rally in Charlotte, N.C., that the Democratic ticket
stood for a strong national defense and was ``ready to pay the
price to defend freedom.''
   Quayle took time out from his debate preparation to travel to
Philadelphia for a fund-raiser and firehouse exposition. Aides said
he spent the morning in question-and-answer sessions with his staff
and on Saturday would hold a mock debate with Sen. Bob Packwood,
R-Ore., who is standing in for Bentsen during the practice session.
   David Prosperi, Quayle's spokesman, said that session would be
videotaped and reviewed over the weekend.
   In his Texas appearance, Dukakis criticized Bush for hiring
Democrat Zbigniew Brzezinski as an adviser. He contended that
Brzezinski, who was President Jimmy Carter's national security
adviser, was an architect of the 1980 grain embargo.
   ``I'm not going to embargo grain and I'm not going to hire Mr.
Brzezinski,'' Dukakis said.

<HEAD>Pinochet Winds Down Plebiscite Campaign With Attack On Critics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALPARAISO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military President Augusto Pinochet,
winding down his campaign for eight more years of rule, on Thursday
called his political foes liars ``infected'' by contact with
communists.
   In a speech before thousands of supporters in the central port
city of Valparaiso, 75 miles west of the capital Santiago, Pinochet
called on citizens to vote ``yes'' in the Oct. 5 plebiscite on his
presidency.
   If he wins, he said, ``in this next period I will dedicate
myself wholly to my people, for my people and with my people.''
   Speaking of his political opponents, he declared: ``I'm
profoundly worried by some gentlemen who call themselves democrats
and nonetheless embrace and shake hands with Marxist communists.
What kind of mix is that?''
   ``No one understands them because they lie, lie, lie, because
they are infected by communists,'' he said.
   In speeches and mass media propaganda, Pinochet and supporters
have repeatedly tried to link the moderate opposition with the
extreme left.
   A coalition of 16 parties, ranging from the center-right to the
Socialist left, is campaigning for his defeat in the plebiscite,
but has excluded the pro-Moscow Communist Party and other Marxist
groups from its ranks.
   Pinochet accused the opposition of ``offering limitless statism,
demagogism that feeds illusions, poverty for thousands of
Chileans.''
   At the polls the nation's 7.4 million registered voters will be
able to ``yes'' or ``no'' on a proposal by the country's military
commanders that Pinochet remain in power until 1997.
   If a majority votes ``yes,'' Pinochet begins a new eight-year
term next March. If most voters choose ``no,'' an open election
will be called next year and Pinochet will be succeeded by the
winner in March 1990.
   Regardless of the outcome, elections are planned in a year for a
Congress, disbanded after Pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973
coup that toppled the elected government of an avowed Marxist,
President Salvador Allende, during a period of social and economic
upheaval.
   By law, political campaigning must end on Sunday, a full 48
hours before the day of the vote. The opposition coalition plans a
massive final rally Saturday in Santiago and a pro-Pinochet
demonstration is slated for Sunday in the capital.

   The House ethics committee has decided there's
no time this year to investigate allegations that Rep. Wayne Owens,
D-Utah, allowed a utility company lobbyist to perform congressional
duties in violation of House rules.
   Ethics panel Chairman Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif., and ranking
Republican John T. Myers of Indiana, announced the decision in a
letter Wednesday to H. Craig Moody, the Utah Republican chairman
who complained about Owens. The letter was released by Owens on
Thursday.
   Owens said he welcomed the committee action, but expressed
``regret they could not deal with the merits of the frivolous
issue'' raised by the GOP chairman.
   Moody complained to the committee Aug. 10 that Owens allowed
Kenley Brunsdale, a Utah Power & Light Co. lobbyist, to perform
congressional staff duties in preparing a financing bill for the
Central Utah water development project.
   The complaint contended the work was illegal because Brunsdale
was receiving a salary from the utility. Moody said Brunsdale's
work on the bill amounted to an in-kind contribution from an
outside entity, which is prohibited under House rules.
   The complaint was mailed hours after the Interior Committee
approved the bill, which boosted the water project's money for the
1989-90 fiscal year by $45.2 million, well under the $750 million
Owens originally sought.
   Dixon and Myers wrote Moody that his filing did not meet the
requirements for complaints made by non-members of the House
against House members.
   Noting the committee could undertake the investigation on its
own, the chairman and ranking member said there is not sufficient
time to consider the matter in the waning days of the 100th
Congress.
   ``However, the committee may entertain taking up the matter in
the next Congress when there will be time to fully investigate and
explore the issues,'' said the two members of what is formally the
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.
   Owens called Moody's complaint ``the thinnest attempted smear in
the history of Utah politics.'' He termed it ``a mean-spirited act
of political desperation....''

<HEAD>Prosecutor Will Not File Charges Against U.S. Swimmers For Prank</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No charges will be filed against two
U.S. Olympic swimmers for the theft of a marble lion's head from a
hotel bar and they can return home now that they apologized for the
prank, a prosecutor said Friday.
   ``The case is now closed and they can leave the country,''
senior prosecutor Yoo Sung-soo said.
   Yoo said he notified the U.S. Embassy that gold-medal winners
Troy Dalbey and Doug Gjertsen and a third American, Ernest Mangum,
can leave Saturday.
   The prosecutor said he decided not to charge the three Americans
because they wrote statements repenting for the action and
apologized to the South Korean people.
   Police said Dalbey and Mangum admitted removing the $830 carving
from a Seoul hotel Saturday, but that an investigation showed
Gjertsen was not involved. Authorities said Dalbey and Mangum, who
identified himself as a friend of the two swimmers, were drunk when
they pulled off the stunt.
   It was not immediately clear why Gjertsen apologized if he was
not involved.
   The case attracted nationwide attention. Hundreds of Koreans
called newspapers and police to demand the swimmers be punished and
prevented from leaving the country.
   The two swimmers said in a statement Tuesday that they were
being exuberant and the incident was a prank to celebrate their
gold medal victories in two Olympic events the previous day. The
two apologized and said they hoped the incident would not damage
U.S.-South Korean relations.
   The two swimmers will keep their medals, but U.S. Olympic
officials kicked them off the team and said they were to be sent
home as soon as they were cleared with police.
   The incident received wide publicity because it took place at a
time of growing anti-U.S. sentiment among South Koreans during the
Olympics. Incidents involving U.S. athletes and news media touched
off a wave of anti-Americanism.
   Many South Koreans are displeased by the disorderly conduct of
U.S. athletes during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. NBC
television also came under fire for its allegedly ``biased''
coverage of a boxing bout, during which South Korean sports
officials attacked a referee.

   A judge dropped civil and contempt
charges Thursday against the impoverished city of East St. Louis
and its mayor despite their inability to produce records explaining
$80,000 in payments.
   Mayor Carl E. Officer said he had ``gone overboard'' to try to
explain why he received the money in addition to his annual $30,000
salary between 1984 and last year.
   Circuit Judge Robert Craig agreed East St. Louis had made
good-faith efforts although many financial records were missing.
St. Clair County State's Attorney John Baricevic, who requested at
a hearing that charges be dropped, would not comment afterward
about his motivation.
   Officer's lawyer, Eric Vickers of St. Louis, said Baricevic
``knows he didn't have a case against him.'' Vickers opposed
dismissal of the lawsuit, saying the mayor had been embarrassed
publicly by the charges and deserved to be exonerated by a trial.
   The mayor and his aides said many of the city's financial
records were lost in a move about three years ago and in an arson
fire in April.
   The lawsuit over the $80,000 was only one of many woes facing
East St. Louis.
   In the past year, the city's bank accounts were frozen three
times, the latest on Wednesday by the federal government, which is
seeking repayment of an Environmental Protection Agency sewer grant
allegedly misused.
   Another freeze expected to be lifted soon resulted from
firefighters going to court to force payment of more than $82,000
owed them for five years of clothing allowances.
   The city of 55,000 people across the Mississippi River from St.
Louis had repeatedly failed to meet its payroll, requiring an
infusion of state money in June. But the city has avoided seeking
bankruptcy protection, because that would allow a court-appointed
trustee to make decisions now in the hands of elected officials.
   Officer, meanwhile, faces a federal inquiry into his campaign
finances, focusing on whether he failed to report the transfer of
$19,000 in 1986 from Pete Fields, an unsuccessful congressional
candidate.
   The mayor has denied breaking any laws and said he had no qualms
about the investigation. But he told city council members Wednesday
night that the EPA judgment, combined with a projected city deficit
of nearly $500,000 for the rest of the year, will lead to more
layoffs.
   ``We're going to have to cut and cut deep,'' he said.
   In April, state prosecutors went to court to force the city to
pick up garbage after cutbacks suspended regular pickups for six
months.
   One of the biggest financial setbacks for East St. Louis this
year was a $4 million judgment won by a jail inmate who suffered
brain damage when he was beaten by another prisoner. Officials said
they didn't have the money to pay the award, but the inmate's
attorney garnished the city operating funds.

<HEAD>District's Budget Hits Snag On Abortion Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Thursday voted to withhold $530
million in federal financing from the District of Columbia and to
bar the city from spending its own tax dollars if it uses public
funds to finance poor women's abortions in most cases.
   The House, while considering the district's $3.2 billion budget
for the 1989 fiscal year that starts Saturday, by voice vote
approved an amendment that would limit the district's spending on
Medicaid abortions to those cases in which the mother's life is in
jeopardy.
   The legislation then was sent back to a House-Senate conference
committee. Approval by the conference committee would send the
measure to the Senate.
   President Reagan has said he would veto the district's spending
package unless the anti-abortion amendment, sponsored by Rep.
Robert Dornan, R-Calif., is included.
   Current law allows the city to use locally generated funds for
Medicaid abortions, and allows federal spending on Medicaid
abortions in cases of rape and incest, ectopic pregnancies, and
when the mother's life is threatened.
   Earlier Thursday, Senate negotiators on the conference committee
had rejected a House proposal that would have simply frozen federal
funds if Medicaid abortions were not restricted to cases in which
the mother's life was threatened.
   The district's Medicaid program financed 3,599 of the 19,942
abortions reported in the city in 1986, according to Douglas
Johnson, a spokesman for the National Right to Life Committee.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said
Thursday he will be able to work with newly appointed Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski despite past differences.
   ``I know his arguments and his way of thinking,'' the leader of
the banned trade union movement said, speaking at a news conference
on his 45th birthday.
   Walesa referred to the legal period of Solidarity in 1981, when
Rakowski was deputy prime minister in charge of dealing with trade
unions. Solidarity was banned in early 1982.
   ``I always came to Mr. Rakowski in those times with various
problems and I always looked afterward at what I got, and not at
Mr. Rakowski. I have to admit I had no complaints about the work,''
he said.
   ``Similarly now I am ready to solve all the problems that I am
going to raise. I have enough arguments, all of Europe and the
world know them,'' said Walesa, winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace
Prize.
   Parliament on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved Rakowski as the
country's ninth prime minister since World War II.
   The government led by Zbigniew Messner resigned Sept. 19
following strong criticism of its failure to achieve reform.
   In his speech to Parliament, Rakowski asked for two weeks to
form a government of people with ``reformatory attitudes'' and said
he hoped to broaden the Communist-dominated government.
   Walesa said he could shed no light on exactly when planned
round-table talks with authorities slated for mid-October will
begin. Authorities agreed to the talks on Solidarity after a wave
of strikes in August.
   ``Society is waiting for the round-table talks, that is
evident,'' Walesa said.
   He said Solidarity would object if the talks were stretched out
for too long.
   ``We are not marathon runners,'' he said.
   In a statement issued Thursday, the Warsaw branch of the Club of
Catholic Intelligentsia urged the round-table to take decisions to
change the form of public life in Poland and called for
legalization of Solidarity.
   ``The fulfillment of this postulate (legalization of Solidarity)
is the essential condition of actual reform of political and
economic life,'' the statement said.
   Club President Andrzej Stelmachowski has played a key role as an
intermediary between the authorities and Solidarity recently.
   In London, the opposition Labor Party on Thursday accused
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of ``supreme hypocrisy''
in arranging to meet Walesa Oct. 18 in Gdansk at the end of a
three-day official visit.
   ``She is undermining the position of trades unions at home while
appearing to encourage trades unionists in another country,'' said
George Foulkes, Labor Party foreign affairs spokesman.
   Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative government has drastically reduced
British labor union powers.

   A man awaiting trial in the slaying
of one of the nation's best-known television personalities was shot
fatally Friday after he tried to seize the pistol of an off-duty
prison guard, officials said.
   Jaime Balatbat, who had been in jail nearly two years on charges
arising from the Oct. 14, 1986, slaying of actress and socialite
Elvira Manahan, died at a hospital after the early morning shooting
at a jail in suburban Makati.
   The guard, Patrolman Rolando Ramos, said he was about to leave
the prison at the end of his shift when Balatbat approached him,
grabbed his hand and tried to seize the pistol from his waist.
   ``It happened so fast. There were shots. I thought I was hurt,
then I saw him fall,'' Ramos said.
   Ms. Manahan was the hostess of a popular television talk show
``Two for the Road.''
   A maid working for Ms. Manahan had told a court she allowed
Balatbat, a former business partner of the actress, into the house
and he then went on a shooting rampage.
   The maid survived the attack, which killed two other servants.
Ms. Manahan was shot in the head and died a few days later.
   Balatbat denied the murder charges.

Seen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a weakening Hurricane Helene raced north through
the mid-Atlantic on Thursday, forecasters tracked a tropical
depression that showed signs of strengthening east of the Caribbean.
   Hurricane Helene's winds of 80 mph kept it slightly above
hurricane status as it moved north-northeast at 48 mph, National
Hurricane Center forecasters said.
   Center meteorologist Jesse Moore said Helene is expected to
become absorbed Friday in a large low-pressure area over the north
Atlantic and its winds will be dispersed.
   ``There will still be some strong winds, but they will be over a
much larger area,'' said Moore. ``It will become a big Atlantic
storm.''
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Thursday, the hurricane's center was near
latitude 48.5 north and longitude 36.5 west, or about 680 miles
northwest of the westernmost Azores, the center reported. It posed
a threat only to ships.
   Helene, the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic season, will be
classified a hurricane as long as its winds stay above 73 mph.
Spawned last week near the Cape Verde Islands off west Africa, the
hurricane peaked with 140 mph winds before the storm veered north.
   Meanwhile, the 16th tropical depression of the season was 545
miles east-southeast of Barbados and moving west at 17 mph.
   The system that formed Wednesday had winds of about 35 mph
Thursday and some increase is expected, the hurricane center
predicted.
   The hurricane season started June 1 and ends Nov. 30.

<HEAD>Bush Sought to Restrict Justice Department Inquiry in CIA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When he led the CIA during the Ford
administration, Vice President George Bush battled the Justice
Department in an effort to restrict a criminal investigation of
senior CIA officials, a published report said.
   At the time, a federal grand jury was investigating allegations
that officials working for or with the CIA, including former CIA
Director Richard Helms, lied under oath to Congress about CIA
operations in Chile during the early 1970s.
   Information about the dispute between Bush, the Justice
Department and the Ford White House staff came from newly released
files in the Gerald R. Ford presidential library in Ann Arbor,
Mich., the Los Angeles Times reported in its Friday editions.
   The files showed that in October 1976, citing the need to
protect intelligence sources, Bush repeatedly sought to prevent
some documents from being declassified and CIA witnesses from being
called before a federal grand jury.
   When White House officials reminded Bush that President Ford had
already given a public pledge that his administration would not use
classification or any other means to prevent exposure of illegal
activities, Bush balked, according to the files.
   ``An impasse exists between the Justice Department and Director
George Bush of the CIA,'' White House counsel Philip W. Buchen
wrote to Ford.
   Buchen told the president that if the Justice Department failed
to obtain the disputed information, it ``would abort the pending
investigation and lead to no prosecution.''
   In a memo at the time to another White House official, Bush
said, ``There is no intention on my part or on the part of this
agency to take any action that might reasonably be construed as an
effort to thwart or frustrate the investigation being conducted by
the (Justice) Department.
   ``At the same time, I mean to do whatever is necessary and
appropriate to carry out my statutory mandate to protect
intelligence sources and methods, believing as I do that such
protection is at the heart of the agency's ability to function
effectively,'' he said.
   President Ford instructed Bush to let federal prosecutors have
what they needed.
   The Justice Department investigation eventually resulted in
Helms' 1977 plea of no contest to two criminal charges of failing
to testify ``fully, completely and accurately'' to Congress.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said through a spokeswoman
he would withhold comment until seeing the documents. Spokesman
Mark Goodin told The Associated Press late Friday he could not
comment until he had read the report.

   Lloyd Bentsen welcomed running mate Michael
Dukakis back to Texas on Thursday and said if their ``radical
right'' rivals win the White House ``we'll be living in the 19th
century instead of the 20th century.''
   The Texas senator introduced Dukakis at a $1.2 million
Democratic Party fund-raiser in Dallas after appearing with him to
formally accept the endorsement of the Combined Law Enforcement
Association of Texas, the state's largest police organization.
   At that gathering, Bentsen joked about Republican presidential
nominee George Bush's claim to Texas as his adopted home state.
Bush's legal residence is a hotel suite in Houston.
   Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, asked
presidential nominee Dukakis if he had checked into their hotel yet
and then deadpanned: ``In some people's mind that makes you a
Texan.''
   At the fund-raiser, Bentsen said Bush has been a partner in an
administration that hurt Texas by failing to adopt a national
energy policy and attacked the vice president and other Republicans
for questioning the patriotism of Dukakis, whom he introduced as
``a patriot for Massachusetts.''
   ``This election is about much more than waving the flag,''
Bentsen said. ``The question is what are we going to do together to
make us even prouder of our allegiance for the next four, for the
next eight and for the next 12 years from now when our children are
ready to the future.''
   Bentsen said Dukakis would provide activist leadership from the
Oval Office and, in an apparent swipe at President Reagan, said
that if he and Dukakis are elected there will be no ``falling
asleep at the switch while second-level aides run the show.''
   Bentsen said he was eager to debate GOP counterpart Dan Quayle
next week and characterized the Indiana senator as having ``a
radical-right agenda'' out of the mainstream of American voters.
   ``He doesn't even know what century he lives in,'' Bentsen said
in a gibe at a recent gaffe in which Quayle said he did not live in
this century. ``And believe me, if they get their way, we'll be
living in the 19th century instead of the 20th century.''
   Bentsen in recent days has been leading the counterattack to GOP
charges that Dukakis is out of the mainstream by accusing Bush of
pandering to the arch-conservative wing of his party in selecting
Quayle as his running mate.
   Bentsen came to Texas from Nashville, Tenn., where he visited a
middle school to reiterate Dukakis' support for the nation's space
program and urge the students to consider becoming scientists and
astronauts.
   Bentsen had planned to stay at the school and watch the launch
on television with the schoolchildren, but he left after liftoff
was delayed.
   Sharing a small seat with his wife, Beryl Ann, and surrounded by
staff and reporters, Bentsen watched the launch on television at
the Nashville airport before leaving the city for Texas,.
   ``It's a great morning,'' he said as Discovery soared into
orbit. ``It looks perfect.''
   At the school, Bentsen said the shuttle launch ``marks a new
beginning in our space program.''
   ``It is a good beginning but there are more challenges ahead of
us,'' he said.
   He told the students Dukakis was committed to the shuttle
program and to a permanently manned U.S. space station. Dukakis
also has promised to revive a Cabinet-level space council and to
put Bentsen in charge of it.
   ``Machines can go into space, but really only people can explore
space, probing for its secrets and reaching for the stars,''
Bentsen said.

   Discovery's astronauts, having
achieved the triumph of liftoff and the crucial business of
satellite delivery, settled into a workmanlike routine today with
scientific experiments and time out for sightseeing and Mozart.
   The relatively quiet schedule contrasts with the tense drama of
fire and thunder as they rocketed into orbit Thursday and revived
an American space program that had been devastated 32 months
earlier by the explosion of Challenger and the loss of its seven
crew members.
   ``We sure appreciate your all getting us up in orbit the way we
should be,'' Discovery's commander, Frederick H. Hauck, told
Mission Control soon after he and his four crew members achieved
orbit 184 miles above Earth.

   The first major welfare overhaul since the
Great Depression holds out the prospect of jobs, education and
self-sufficiency to poor people who otherwise could face a lifetime
of dependence on government handouts.
   The Family Welfare Reform Act won a ringing 96-1 endorsement
Thursday from the Senate, with Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the only
dissenter.
   The House scheduled a vote on the measure today, with certain
White House approval at the end of the road.

   The Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee met today in a hastily organized session to discuss a
reorganization of the party structure that likely will mean
top-level personnel changes as well.
   The Tass news agency said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev was
making a report to the 300 members of the Central Committee, made
up of party, government and military leaders.
   Tass said in its three-paragraph statement that the plenary
session would consider ``proposals on reorganization of the party
apparatus in the light of the decisions of the 19th Communist Party
conference.''

   The Soviets charged that U.N. peacekeeping
forces in Afghanistan were failing in their mission hours after the
peacekeepers popped champagne corks to celebrate their Nobel Peace
Prize.
   Several Western leaders, including President Reagan who was
himself in the running for the prize, praised the decision to award
it to U.N. peacekeepers worldwide.
   U.N. leaders said they, too, were delighted with the award
announced Thursday, but they also pleaded for the release of a U.S.
Marine kidnapped while serving with a peacekeeping group in Lebanon.

   President Reagan and Congress are hoping their
election-year budget truce holds and that their efforts to complete
the government's spending business don't turn into a pumpkin at
midnight tonight.
   If all 13 appropriations bills needed to keep federal agencies
running for the fiscal year that starts Saturday are enacted before
the clock strikes 12, it will mark the first on-time budget
performance since 1948.
   ``We're all goggle-eyed about that,'' said Rep. Joe Skeen,
R-N.M., ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee's
Treasury subcommittee.

   A $1.1 million award against school officials
for barring three young AIDS-infected brothers from class is a
lesson to educators nationwide, says the judge who approved the
settlement of the civil rights suit.
   ``Let us hope there will not have to be too many more cases for
other families and other school boards like the Ray case, which ...
was a landmark case,'' U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich
said Thursday after lawyers for both sides outlined the terms in
court.
   She praised both sides for settling the dispute without a trial,
which had been set to begin Monday in Fort Myers.

   A hijacker who wanted a pilot to
crash a jetliner carrying more than 100 people into a government
building was wounded and captured after he shot four crew members,
killing one, officials said.
   Security forces shot Raimundo Conceicao on Thursday night as he
walked toward a getaway plane with the pilot of the passenger jet,
a Boeing 737 from Brazil's VASP airlines.
   Conceicao turned and shot the pilot, wounding him in the leg,
officials said, describing the 28-year-old as a ``psychopath.''

<HEAD>Versatile Remick Plays Small-Town Heroine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lee Remick has made a career of avoiding
typecasting.
   She was an alcoholic in ``The Days of Wine and Roses,'' a tough
piano coach in ``The Competition,'' a suicidal actress in the TV
movie ``Haywire'' and Winston Churchill's mother in the seven-part
television series ``Jennie.''
   Two seasons ago, she was nominated for an Emmy for her role as a
woman who persuaded her son to kill her father in the fact-based,
major NBC miniseries ``Nutcracker: Money, Murder and Madness.''
   Her newest project is another about-face, the CBS movie
``Jesse'' this Tuesday. It's a small film with a simple story.
Remick plays a dedicated nurse in a doctorless small town who is
arrested for practicing medicine without a license.
   Remick, who had flown to New York from her home in Cape Cod to
help publicize the movie, said she has spent recent years doing
mostly television, because that's where the diverse roles are.
   ``I just look for the stuff that interests me. And I don't like
to repeat,'' she said. ``That's the nature of the biz. Once you've
done something well, they think, `Ah, that's what she does,' and
they keep sending you the same script over and over again.
   ``I haven't been offered anything in a feature in a few years
that has come close to giving me that kind of fertile ground to
play with,'' she said, ``and that's why I try to find different
stuff, each one. Say, `Nutcracker' a couple of years ago to this,
which is just as polarized as they can possibly be.''
   ``Jesse,'' filmed in Arizona, is based on a true story. In the
1960s, a woman was arrested for practicing medicine without a
medical license, even though the nearest doctor was more than 100
miles away. When she insists on having a jury trial rather than
just paying a fine, she has to cross two mountain ranges to reach
the courthouse. To her surprise and joy, the entire town packs up
and goes with her.
   The movie was directed by Glenn Jordan, who directed Remick in
the television movies ``The Women's Room'' and ``Toughlove.'' His
``Promise,'' starring James Garner and James Woods, won an Emmy two
years ago.
   ``I just think he's wonderful,'' Remick said. ``It was he who
brought the piece to me. It appealed to us both, I think, for the
same reasons _ because of the basic core of what it's about, the
sort of Frank Capra-esque quality of it, of the little guy taking
on the big government machine and winning. I don't want to ennoble
it too much, but it's about the strength of humanity of this woman
as opposed to the cold, inhumane aspect of the law that said she
shouldn't help anybody, under those circumstances.
   ``To the letter of the law, she was breaking it, no question,
absolutely no question. But it's the law that was wrong in this
case. I'm certainly not an advocate of people going around breaking
the law, saying I know better, but in this case, she was way ahead
of them.''
   Remick's next project, another CBS movie slated to air next
year, is ``A Bridge to Silence,'' co-starring Marlee Matlin, who
won an Academy Award for her role in ``Children of a Lesser God.''
For Matlin, who is deaf, the TV movie will be her first speaking
role. She and Remick play a daughter and mother.
   ``She's remarkable. She's a wonderful actress,'' Remick said.
``She's so open and kind of instinctive and free. ... Curious.
Interesting experience, which I had some concern about. When I
started I thought, you know, what's it going to be like for the two
of us to communicate? I do not have sign language at my beck and
call. ... But we did. It was terrific.''
   The movie, filmed in Canada and directed by Karen Arthur, was
something of a first for Remick, too, since she had never worked
with a female director before.
   ``Interesting working with a woman,'' she said. ``Not that it's
different in terms of her work, she's doing the same thing as men
do, but I've just never been in that position. Directors have
always been kind of father figures. It's interesting. It's
wonderful. She's terrific.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   `SLAP' GOES CULT _ The Arts & Entertainment Network has picked
up the season's worth of episodes of ABC's canceled ``The `Slap'
Maxwell Story.'' The offbeat, half-hour comedy stars Dabney Coleman
as a middle-aged sportswriter. The show received critical praise,
but never scored well in the ratings, the same fate that befell
another Jay Tarses-produced series also seen on A&E, ``Buffalo
Bill.'' ``Slap'' will premiere on the cable channel in January. ...
   PBS EXEC DANCES OFF TO SUNDANCE _ Suzanne Weil, the head of
national programming for the Public Broadcasting Service, is
leaving to become executive director of the Sundance Institute,
actor-director Robert Redford's independent filmmakers' forum in
Utah. Weil departs in early October, but will continue as a PBS
consultant until January. Weil has been with PBS for 10 years.

   The success of this summer's ``Bull Durham''
has helped lead the way to an outpouring of movies about baseball,
once considered box-office poison by the moguls who ran the
Hollywood studios.
   During its first month of release, ``Bull Durham,'' a funny,
sexy account of minor-league baseball starring Kevin Costner and
Susan Sarandon, scored $26 million in ticket sales in the United
States and Canada. The Orion release, written and directed by
former bush league player Ron Shelton, has been followed by ``Eight
Men Out'' and ``Stealing Home.''
   ``Eight Men Out,'' John Sayles' drama about baseball's greatest
scandal, the sellout by members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox,
received a warm welcome from critics. Stars include Charlie Sheen,
D.B. Sweeney, John Cusack and Christopher Lloyd.
   Jodie Foster won raves for her performance in ``Stealing Home,''
the story of a minor league ballplayer seeking a comeback after
years on the skids. TV's Mark Harmon co-stars.
   Upcoming baseball movies include:
   _ ``Major League,'' with Charlie Sheen and Tom Berenger as
members of a hapless team who suddenly become winners, Rocky-style.
   _ ``The Scout,'' Anson Williams directing Rodney Dangerfield as
a baseball scout who uncovers a potential superstar. It is filming
this fall.
   _ ``Shoeless Joe,'' filming in Dubuque, Iowa, with Kevin
Costner, James Earl Jones, Amy Madigan and Burt Lancaster.
According to writer-director Phil Alden Robinson, it is not really
a baseball movie.
   Based on a novel by W.P. Kinsella, it concerns a farmer
(Costner) who is told by a spirit that Shoeless Joe Jackson of
Black Sox fame will come back to life if he builds a diamond in a
cornfield.
   _ ``Trading Hearts,'' already playing in a few regions, a
romance about a pitcher (Raul Julia), who is cut from spring
training.
   Producer Herb Jaffe said ``Trading Hearts'' also is not a
baseball picture.
   That's a hangover from the long-held belief that baseball
strikes out in theaters. The arguments most often heard over the
years are that baseball is incomprehensible to foreign audiences,
and that women, who make up a large part of movie audiences, will
not want to see films about baseball.
   Thom Mount, producer of ``Bull Durham'' and part owner of the
minor league Durham, N.C., Bulls, encountered such prejudice when
he sought a releasing company.
   ``Five studios turned us down before Orion picked up `Bull
Durham,''' he said. ``We were told simply that baseball pictures
don't make money.'' He attributed the film's success to the appeal
of Costner.
   ``Also, young women are impressed with the role Susan Sarandon
plays _ a strong, vital, liberated character.''
   By attracting the female audience, ``Bull Durham'' appears to
have solved one of Hollywood's prejudices. It remains to be seen
whether it can also appeal to foreign moviegoers; there is hope in
baseball-crazy Japan, and the game has been spreading to other
countries as well. Given the reasonable cost _ $9 million _ ``Bull
Durham'' is assured of a profit in the domestic market alone.
   A survey of baseball movies over the years indicates that the
studios' anti-baseball attitude may have been justified. Even the
box-office luster of Robert Redford couldn't convert the
allegorical ``The Natural'' into a winner.
   The best-remembered of baseball movies, ``The Pride of the
Yankees,'' with Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, was another commercial
disappointment.
   Many other biographical films have failed to excite the
movie-going public, especially women:
   ``The Winning Team,'' with Ronald Reagan as Grover Cleveland
Alexander; ``The Babe Ruth Story,'' William Bendix as the great
Bambino; ``The Stratton Story,'' James Stewart as Monty Stratton,
who staged a comeback after losing a leg; ``The Pride of St.
Louis,'' Dan Dailey Jr. as Dizzy Dean; ``The Jackie Robinson
Story,'' in which the black pioneer in the major leagues played
himself; ``Fear Strikes Out,'' Anthony Perkins as Jim Piersall,
victim of mental illness.
   Baseball musicals have proved to be only middling hits: ``Damn
Yankees'' with Tab Hunter and Gwen Verdon; ``Take Me Out to the
Ballgame,'' with Gene Kelly, Esther Williams and Frank Sinatra. The
same with comedies: ``Alibi Ike'' (Joe E. Brown); ``Rhubarb'' (Ray
Milland); ``It Happens Every Spring'' (Ray Milland).
   The difficulty of selling a baseball movie to the studios is
illustrated with ``Eight Men Out,'' produced, oddly enough, by
three women: Barbara Boyle, Midge Sanford and Sara Pillsbury. A
book about the White Sox scandal was optioned in 1980, but the film
was not made until this year.
   ``We couldn't get a development deal anywhere,'' Pillsbury said.
``The story had three strikes against it: The subject was
undeniably baseball; it was an ensemble piece; it was period and
hence expensive. We were told that baseball pictures had never been
successful, especially overseas.''
   The producers finally made a deal with Orion Pictures, which
also sponsored ``Bull Durham'' and ``The Scout.''
   Pillsbury thinks ``Eight Men Out'' will appeal to women.
   ``Baseball is simply the arena that the story takes place in,''
she said. ``It's more of a human story which is all the more
exciting because it is true.''
   ``The Scout'' also had a tortuous route to the screen. The film
actually went into production in 1982 with Peter Falk as star, then
was suspended. Earlier this year Orion sent it to Kathy
Lymberopoulos, producer and associate of Rodney Dangerfield.
   The story, she said, centers mainly on a baseball scout's life
and less on the game itself. As to any feminine prejudice against
baseball, she added, ``I love baseball, and so do a lot of women.
You look around a ballpark today and you'll see about
half-and-half, men and women.''
   What do the players themselves think of baseball movies? Here's
Lou Johnson, 53, star of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1960s and
now doing community service, lecturing against alcohol and drug
abuse:
   ``I've liked some of them, like the Lou Gehrig story, Roy
Campanella (TV movie) and Jackie Robinson, `Bingo Long' and `The
Natural.' But you're not going to get an accurate picture of
baseball out of movies. There's got to be a lot of fantasizing.
They give you what the public wants, not what is real.
   ``I especially liked `Bingo Long' because it was about the Negro
American League, and I could identify with it. It captured the
particular social life and lifestyle that we all went through,'' he
said.

   D.B. Sweeney approaches acting the way Shoeless
Joe Jackson played baseball: Just do it.
   ``The best theory I ever heard about acting was from (James)
Cagney,'' said Sweeney, 26, who plays Jackson in John Sayles'
``Eight Men Out,'' the story of the 1919 Chicago White Sox scandal.
   ``You walk in. Plant your feet. Stare the other fellow in the
eyes and tell the truth. All the acting theories I've heard, all
the books I've read ... you can't get it any simpler or purer than
that.''
   ``Eight Men Out'' tells the story of the biggest scandal in
baseball. The 1919 White Sox were widely regarded as the best team
of their time. With such pitchers as Ed Cicotte and Lefty Williams,
and a lineup featuring future Hall of Famers Eddie Collins and Ray
Schalk, Chicago won the American League pennant and were heavy
favorites against the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series.
   No one, however, could play ball like Jackson, a lifetime .356
hitter and outstanding left fielder. Once a mill worker in South
Carolina, he had little education and could not read or write, but
was peerless on the field.
   ``He was very passive,'' Sweeney noted. ``He took the path of
least resistance in everything he could. Everything he did was from
a defensive mode, except on the field, where he attacks.''
   Sweeney wanted to contrast Jackson's athletic grace with his
awkwardness in private life.
   ``On the field, I wanted him to be like (ballet superstar
Mikhail) Baryshnikov. I wanted every move he made to be
beautiful,'' Sweeney said. ``Off the field, I wanted him to be
tentative.''
   Players earned little money in Jackson's era and were often
tempted by gamblers to throw games. Eight members of the White Sox,
including Jackson, agreed to, or were aware of, an effort to
deliberately throw the series against Cincinnati.
   The Reds won the series and the White Sox' poor play aroused
widespread suspicion. The following year, Commissioner Kenesaw M.
Landis permanently banned Jackson and his seven teammates from
baseball.
   No one could ever prove that Jackson, who batted .375 in the
World Series, ever tried to throw a game. More likely, he was
punished for being aware of the fix and not trying to stop it.
   ``They don't kick you out of the Pentagon for knowing about
fraud,'' Sweeney said, adding that Jackson, who died in 1951,
should have his name cleared and be inducted into the Baseball Hall
of Fame.
   Daniel Bernard Sweeney was born and raised in Shoreham, N.Y. He
attended Tulane University and hoped to play major league baseball
until tearing ligaments in his right knee.
   The injury convinced Sweeney to pursue a career in acting, and
he transferred to the performing arts division of New York
University. After graduating in 1984, he appeared in the Broadway
revival of ``The Caine Mutiny.''
   He made his film debut in Sidney Lumet's ``Power,'' and has
since appeared in Francis Ford Coppola's ``Gardens of Stone'' and
``No Man's Land.''
   Although Sweeney has not appeared on stage in two years, he
still prefers the working atmosphere of the theater.
   ``On `No Man's Land,' there were about four producers, one
director to start the film and one to end it. We had five different
writers. And by the way, we also have these actors,'' he said.
   ``In a play, even if it's a Neil Simon play on Broadway, it's
going to have to be about the actors or nobody's going to come. I
enjoy acting on stage better because there are less people with
walkie-talkie's in your face.''
   Sweeney felt an immediate rapport with Sayles (``Brother From
Another Planet,'' ``Matewan''), and enjoyed working with him on the
set.
   ``We met in New York and talked for about an hour. We talked
about Roberto Clemente (the late Pittsburgh Pirates star). John
likes the Pirates. He's a real blue-collar man. Those are the right
reasons to like a baseball team,'' he said.
   ``I had access to John all the time. We had a great
relationship. We would just check in with each other to gauge each
other's continued enthusiasm.''
   To prepare for the film, Sweeney traveled to Kenosha, Wis., and
worked out with the local minor league team.
   ``Kenosha is a good town for Jackson. A real blue-collar town.
Everybody there works for one of those corporations. I think
there's a similar ethic about work that Jackson might have grown up
with.
   ``That's the world where Jackson came from.''
   Playing Jackson boiled down to forgetting about everything
except baseball.
   ``I tried to stand there and clear my mind,'' Sweeney said. ``He
would just stand and take his three swings and more often than not,
hit it, and hit it well. In my daily life, I have to deal with bank
statements, acting, associates and friends and things. It's often
like a juggling act.''

   It's so, Joe.
   The baseball movie, long relegated to Hollywood's minor leagues,
is the winner of 1988's cinematic comeback of the year award. From
summer smash ``Bull Durham'' to critical rave ``Eight Men Out,''
baseball movies are back.
   And so what if ``Stealing Home,'' the Mark Harmon-Jodie Foster
entry in the baseball movie race, was almost universally panned?
Two out of three means Hollywood is batting .667 this year.
   The bounce back of baseball has prompted musings on the subject
in The Washington Post, The New York Times and Newsweek. Actor
Kevin Costner delivered the Most Valuable Performance in ``Durham''
as veteran minor league catcher Crash Davis, but an assortment of
stars suited up this year: Mark Harmon, Charlie Sheen and D.B.
Sweeney, to name a few.
   Costner and Sheen will do it again for movies coming out next
year. The switch-hitting Costner will appear in ``Shoeless Joe,''
playing a farmer under the sway of ``Black Sox'' star Joe Jackson's
ghost, while Sheen will be joined by ``L.A. Law'' star Corbin
Bernsen in ``Major League.''
   But why this return of the ballplayer as movie star after years
without any horsehide hits?
   _ The `R' rating. Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, who was married in
``Pride of the Yankees,'' never enjoyed the off-field activities of
Durham Bulls rookie righthander Nuke LaLoosh. And if Susan Sarandon
had played Mrs. Gehrig, Lou might have been the luckiest man on the
face of the Earth.
   _ The popularity of baseball. Virtually everybody has played or
watched the American Pastime. Major league attendance increases
every year _ in fact, you can expect that announcement from
outgoing commissioner Peter Ueberroth within weeks of the season's
finish this year.
   _ The ``I-Can-Do-That'' Syndrome. This factor is best described
by National Lampoon editor Matty Simmons: ``Any 5-foot-3, 270-pound
slob can watch George Bell blast a Roger Clemens 95-mph fastball
into northern Quebec and say to himself, `I can do that.' Why?
Because baseball players look like human beings. They look like
they belong behind a 7-Eleven counter.''
   Think about it. Can't you picture New York Mets phenom Gregg
Jefferies serving up a cold Slurpee and a Big Gulp? Now try to
imagine New York Giants rookie Jumbo Elliot, 6-foot-6, 305 pounds,
doing the same thing.
   As Simmons points out, Elliot could BE a 7-Eleven counter.
   There's one more big reason: the movies are better. In the past,
most baseball movies focused on one player, one star. There was
Jimmy Stewart as one-legged pitcher Monty Stratton. And Anthony
``Psycho'' Perkins as outfielder Jimmy Piersall. Or Ronald Reagan
playing hurler Grover Cleveland Alexander before his career really
took off.
   ``Bull Durham'' was the product of writer-director Ron Shelton,
who spent five years kicking around the minor leagues in the
Baltimore Orioles organization. ``Eight Men Out'' was done by John
Sayles, a die-hard baseball fan.

<HEAD>Military Mortuary Volunteers Get Stress Counseling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THERESA HUMPHREY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In December 1985, when 248
soldiers and eight crewmen died in a plane crash in Gander,
Newfoundland, the remains were dug out of the ice and snow and
transferred here to be identified and prepared for burial.
   Nearly 400 servicemen stationed at Dover Air Force Base
volunteered to work around the clock at the gruesome task, cleaning
the building, running errands, putting together uniforms _ all to
see that the bodies were returned to their families before
Christmas.
   The long hours in which the tragic became the mundane inevitably
led to a special kind of stress, and that in turn led to a special
kind of counseling at this base, which serves as the U.S.
military's morgue and mortuary.
   The counseling program for the volunteers is called ``critical
incident stress debriefing.''
   ``The debriefing process is basically designed to help normal
people ... deal with exposure to overwhelming and traumatic events
in terms of dealing with it personally, emotionally and
professionally,'' said Michael J. Robinson, director of the base
Family Support Center.
   ``What ended up happening,'' Robinson said, recalling the
aftermath of the Gander crash, ``was that early on, probably about
four days into the operation, people began to notice that people
were having a lot of trouble coping, dealing, functioning.
   ``And a lot of the behavior we saw people dealing with were
situations that you find in battle fatigue-like situations, combat
stress situations.''
   It wasn't the first time for Dover Air Force Base.
   Inside the main door of the mortuary is a simple wooden plaque,
headed ``Significant Events,'' listing numbers and faraway place
names that evoke memories of flag-draped coffins.
   The places _ Gander, Jonestown, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf _ are
reminders of the thousands of dead U.S. servicemen and the
civilians whose remains have come home through the base.
   A nondescript, 30,000-square-foot building houses the largest
mortuary operated by the armed services.
   ``It's really the largest mortuary in the country,'' said
Charles Carson, a civilian government employee who started in the
funeral business in 1950 and who has been in charge of the facility
for 17 years.
   The mortuary can handle up to 100 bodies per day, and there is
storage space for up to 1,000. The average workload is 55 to 60
bodies per month, but the average workload is not what the mortuary
is noted for.
   War, disasters and terrorist acts _ the ``significant events'' _
have sent 23,722 bodies through the mortuary, 21,693 of them during
the Vietnam war.
   The Jonestown, Guyana, catastrophe where followers of cult
leader Jim Jones committed suicide, resulted in 913 deaths in
November 1978.
   The base received the remains of the seven astronauts from the
space shuttle Challenger.
   When a major tragedy occurs, there is an outpouring of
volunteers from among the ranks of servicemen stationed at Dover,
as in the case of the Gander crash. ``The troops on this base, they
really rallied to this thing. They really wanted to help,'' Carson
said.
   Before the remains arrive, Carson briefs volunteers in an effort
to determine how they perceive death and whether they ``have
hang-ups about dead bodies.''
   Nearly 200 volunteers were on hand when the bodies of 237 U.S.
servicemen were returned from Beirut, Lebanon, victims of the
terrorist bombing of a Marine barracks in October 1983.
   As is most often the case, the bodies from Beirut were
identified and embalmed before arriving. At Dover, they were given
cosmetic work and dressed for burial.
   Gander was significant because the remains came directly from
the crash site, Robinson said.
   Volunteers, working 10 to 14 hours at a stretch, ``were exposed
to some things the average person has a great deal of trouble
dealing with.''
   ``There were some people who had real physical discomfort,
people who were nauseous. We had some people who were coping
extremely well, able to do the job and keep going,'' Robinson said.
   To help alleviate the stress, a mass debriefing was held and
psychological counseling was offered.
   Since the Gander disaster, the Defense Department and all
branches of the military have begun to explore the implications of
the exposure to and the handling of dead bodies.
   Robinson and four others at the base have taken training courses
designed mainly to help firefighters, police officers and emergency
medical personnel learn to cope with the intimacy with death that
they find in their jobs. Robinson hopes to have at least eight or
nine people trained at all times.
   During the Gander disaster, base personnel reacted intuitively
and from knowledge of post traumatic stress disorder, Robinson
said, adding that officials learned ways to ``shelter people from
some of the factors that would increase the likelihood of showing
longterm effects from post traumatic stress disorder.''
   During a stress debriefing, he said, small groups discuss what
they experienced _ ``what it was like for them, what was the
hardest part about that, because what we know is that if someone
talks about exposure to that type of event, the likelihood of them
ending up with longterm post traumatic stress disorder symptoms is
going to be markedly decreased.''
   According to Robinson, volunteers' time in the mortuary will be
reduced in the future. ``Once you go past the third and into the
fourth day, you can predict a lot of the things that are going to
be happening to people emotionally and physically in terms of
wearing down,'' he said.
   As groups are rotated in and out they will probably be debriefed
and given two days off before being allowed to return.
   ``We know what we need to know now,'' Robinson said.

   ``Greetings to the people, this is Tania. On April 15 my
comrades and I expropriated $10,660.02 from the Sunset branch of
the Hibernia Bank. Casualties could have been avoided had the
persons involved kept out of the way and cooperated with the
people's forces.'' _ Patty Hearst, April 1974.

   The newspaper heiress sat smiling in a posh
Manhattan hotel suite, answering questions about her past as an
urban guerrilla and her present status as a suburban housewife.
   ``The whole business gets stirred up every five or 10 years
anyway,'' Patricia Hearst Shaw said, as she sipped a glass of
mineral water. ``And then six months from now they'll have
forgotten what I look like again and that will be that.''
   What's stirring up things now is Paul Schrader's ``Patty
Hearst,'' based on her recently re-released book, ``Patty Hearst:
Her Own Story,'' which tells the story of her 1974 San Francisco
kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army.
   Hearst's two daughters, Lydia, 3, and Gillian, 7, will see
actress Natasha Richardson _ posing as Mommy _ hold a rifle while
robbing a California bank.
   ``It was something I knew would be done,'' she said of the
movie. ``And so, when (producer) Marvin Worth came and said he
wanted to use the book and make a film, I thought, well, this is
kind of my best chance. If it's going to happen, it's going to
happen.''
   Besides, Hearst said, one of her two daughters already knows the
tale of Tania, the name given to her by SLA head Donald DeFreeze,
also known as Field Marshal Cinque. He and five other SLA members
died in a shootout with police three months after the kidnapping.
   ``My eldest does only because she came home from the bus one day
and asked about it. Someone on the bus had told her about it,'' she
said. ``She wasn't that interested in it, you know?
   ``She was kind of shocked that it had really happened. She
couldn't believe it and she's never said anything about it again.''
   Hearst is the daughter of William A. Hearst, chairman of the
board of the Hearst Corp., which owns an assortment of newspapers,
radio stations, magazines and television stations across the
country. Her grandfather, William Randolph Hearst, was the subject
of Orson Welles' acclaimed film, ``Citizen Kane.''
   The kidnapping was more a matter of expediency than anything
else. Her name had been in the newspaper announcing her engagement
to Steven Weed, along with the fact she was attending University of
California at Berkeley. The kidnappers pulled a card with her
address from a public file at school.
   ``They never did ask for ransom,'' Hearst said. ``I'm really
hard-pressed to say what they (the SLA) were thinking about. They
were saying, `Well, we would have kidnapped your father except he
was so much more heavily protected.' And I thought, `Oh, please.'
It's the same as everybody else: They kidnap or injure women and
children because it's easier. I don't know what politically their
goal was supposed to be.''
   As a gesture of good faith on behalf of his daughter, Hearst
established a $2 million program called ``People in Need'' which
distributed food to the needy throughout California. The SLA
leaders never responded to the program; initially, they demanded
that $70 worth of food go to every needy person in the state.
   Patricia Hearst has had her family's support throughout.
   ``I was surprised, because with the SLA they were busy
convincing me that not only had my family abandoned me, they would
never want to see me again,'' she said.
   She maintained in the interview, as she has all along, that she
was brainwashed and totally under the sway of the SLA because of
its mental and physical torture of her.
   The abduction was front-page news. The subsequent events _ two
bank robberies, one slaying, 19 months on the run, rumors the whole
thing was staged, her arrest, trial, conviction and presidential
pardon _ seemed almost like a movie as they occurred.
   ``If you weren't reading about me, you were reading about the
Watergate hearings, or someone else going to prison or being
indicted,'' said Hearst, who appeared on the cover of Newsweek
seven times in two years. ``I guess it just fit right in there with
all the other political drama that was taking place at the time.''
   She was arrested in September 1975, convicted of participating
in the bank robbery and received a seven-year prison sentence.
President Carter pardoned her in 1979. She married Bernard Shaw,
her former bodyguard, and they have been living in Westport, Conn.,
for the past four years.
   Hearst wasn't involved in the making of the movie, although she
did meet once with Richardson and she has viewed the finished
product. Did it bring back bad memories?
   ``Yes and no,'' she said. ``It's really so different for me to
try and look at it as an objective observer. So I haven't really
spent any time thinking how does this make me feel; it's more like,
`What am I seeing up there?'''
   Hearst has changed dramatically from the 21-year-old who raised
a clenched fist for photographers after her arrest by the FBI, who
listed her occupation as ``urban guerrilla,'' who was labeled ``a
common criminal'' by U.S. Attorney General William Saxbe.
   Now 34, she lives quietly with her husband and children,
occasionally returning to San Francisco for such events as the
opening of the opera season.
   The flashbacks that plagued her after the kidnapping _ violent
dreams where she would kill SLA comrades Bill and Emily Harris _
are gone. She giggles nervously about the events of the past,
although she acknowledges that discussing them can be disquieting.
   ``I don't like it much,'' Hearst said.
   And she's hopeful the release of the movie can be the final
chapter in the Hearst case.
   To those who remain skeptical about her story, she says, ``I
think the movie is like reading my book and saying there's still
questions that aren't answered _ well, I guess only if you can't
stand what you read, if you wanted to hear something else.''

<HEAD>`Patty Hearst' Kidnaps the Imagination of Paul Schrader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Director Paul Schrader believes a good movie
should make good dinner conversation.
   ``And maybe that's the goal of this movie _ not to solve the
case,'' said Schrader of his latest project, the film ``Patty
Hearst.''
   While tidy endings abound elsewhere, ``Patty Hearst'' stops just
where it starts: atop a stack of questions, with few explanations
about why a kidnapped heiress became a self-proclaimed urban
guerrilla. Final conclusions about guilt or innocence, as Schrader
sees it, should be made back at home, over roast beef, mashed
potatoes and buttered green beans.
   Such ambiguity marks a change of course for the filmmaker. When
writing ``Taxi Driver,'' ``Raging Bull'' and ``The Last Temptation
of Christ,'' Schrader dealt with visceral emotions. With ``Patty
Hearst,'' he has made a movie whose loudest voice is ambivalence.
   But that, he thinks, is what daily decisions are sometimes
about. ``Movies offer us problems. But life offers us dilemmas,''
he said in an interview. ``It's always easier watching movies
because there is a problem, and they get rid of the problem.''
   Schrader's career, like that of any demanding filmmaker, has
been marked by both triumphs and spills. Even those who didn't see
Robert De Niro in 1976's ``Taxi Driver'' can quote Schrader's
dialogue verbatim: ``You talkin' to me?'' But who remembers 1987's
``Light of Day.''
   He also did an erotic remake of ``Cat People'' in 1981, starring
Nastassja Kinski, Malcolm McDowell and John Heard.
   A Michigan native, he graduated from the University of
California at Los Angeles' film school and lives in New York with
his wife, actress Mary Beth Hurt. Since he began work in 1974 by
writing the screenplay for Sidney Pollack's ``The Yakuza,'' about
Japanese gangsters, Schrader has been drawn repeatedly to colorful
and controversial figures.
   ``I didn't really know the answer to the (Hearst) dilemma
before,'' he said, ``and I still don't. That was one of the things
I had to accept in making the film. The answer to, `Did she or
didn't she?' is yes and no. You try to present that mystery to the
audience. But when I tried to weigh the argument to one side or the
other, I found that it rang false. Yes, she was turned into a
political revolutionary. No, that wasn't Patty Hearst. For every
statement, there is an equally valid counterstatement.''
   When Hearst told her story in the book ``Every Secret Thing,''
she said the Symbionese Liberation Army brainwashed her during her
1974 ordeal. Schrader's movie, while adapted by Nicholas Kazan from
the book, takes a slightly different tack. ``Patty Hearst''
balances the scales, suggesting that Hearst may have made a choice
in her own destiny.
   ``It looked interesting from the outside _ kidnapping, bank
robbery, shootout _ but then you got in it and you say, `Wait.
There's no story,''' Schrader said. ``You can imagine that if she
had died in Watts (during the shootout that killed six SLA members)
what the mythology machine would have made of her. She would have
been Tania, the grand revolutonary hero.
   ``But there are some massive limits here. The story is
dramatically deficient. ... You care about people who do things.
This girl doesn't do anything. She doesn't act. She is acted upon.
It runs against the commercial essence of cinema.''
   To make ``Patty Hearst'' as compelling as possible, Schrader
spun out a visually inventive narrative: It sticks to the facts,
but with odd camera angles, cyclical music and eerie, gothic sets.
He cast British actress Natasha Richardson, daughter of Vanessa
Redgrave, in the title role.
   ``If I did a docudrama, it would just lie there,'' he said.
``This called for a hand of authorship. I am telling her story. And
I have to acknowledge that the first pronoun in that sentence is as
important as the second.''
   Odd though it may sound, there are similarities between Hearst
and some of Schrader's earlier protagonists.
   ``In a way, she's a socially marginable character, too,''
Schrader said. ``And I've always enjoyed taking a point of view of
someone who's sort of on the margins of society _ a psychopathic
cab driver (`Taxi Driver'), a homosexual, suicidal novelist
(`Mishima'), the boxer Jake LaMotta (`Raging Bull'), Jesus (`The
Last Temptation') _ and say, `Let's take their point of view. Let's
see the world as they see it.'
   ``One of the things that the movie sort of says at the end is,
`Here we have this empty vessel, who everyone turns into a symbol
for their own purposes. ... And at the end of the movie, she says,
`Look. I hate to disappoint you. But I'm just me and I'm not that
interesting.'''

   Triumph, like time, can heal all
wounds.
   Powered by redesigned booster rockets, urged skyward by the
hopes and tears of a nervous nation, Discovery took America back to
the last frontier Thursday.
   On paper, its mission was simple: test the new features of the
shuttle and deploy a communications satellite.
   But in the hearts of millions, Discovery headed for the heavens
to erase the vision of explosion frozen for 32 months, to expunge
the haywire contrails that blotted the Florida sky, to place in the
past the public deaths of the Challenger Seven.
   ``This does not mean there are not terrible scars left by
Challenger. But they are no longer wounds,'' said former astronaut
Joe Allen, now an executive at a local aerospace company.
   ``I've always marveled at the resiliency of humans. We are
creatures that throughout history have been beset by challenge and
tragedy, and for whatever reason, able to grieve and pick ourselves
up,'' Allen said.
   Said Jane Smith, widow of Challenger astronaut Michael Smith,
``We feel like we are all, in a sense, flying with them.''
   But back on Earth, the uncertainty for America's space program
is far from over. NASA's abilities and safety efforts are still
scrutinized. Since the free-spending Apollo days, the agency has
had persistent problems getting money from Congress, some members
of which now question the expense of a space station _ NASA's next
goal which is at least eight years away.
   NASA's woes mounted as the Soviet Union was setting records for
space duration. When the five Discovery astronauts reached orbit
Thursday, three cosmonauts were already there aboard the Mir space
station, two of them more than halfway through a mission planned to
last a year.
   It will take some time to catch up. If the United States hopes
to send men to Mars, for example, NASA must learn much more about
the effects of long duration in space, astronauts say.
   Most observers say the United States still has the lead in space
technology, but the Soviets, perhaps to underscore that they are
closing the gap, released the first photos of its space orbiter, a
shuttle look-alike, about 90 minutes before Discovery's glorious
liftoff.
   Still, the roar of Thursday's launch and the shuttle program's
reDiscovery of space turned the questions to cheers across the
country.
   ``When this mission is on the ground, all these other milestones
become real goals,'' said astronaut Linda Godwin, who has been with
NASA three years and is not yet scheduled to fly. ``This step had
to be accomplished. Everything is contingent on when we get back
flying. I think it's a turning point in a sense that Challenger is
no longer our last flight.
   ``Now we have new memories. For a while, all we had was
Challenger.''
   For NASA, the last 32 months have been an emotional and
technological roller-coaster.
   Those seeking the causes of the Challenger explosion found that
the fault was not just the failure of an O-ring seal, but also a
failure of communications within NASA _ warnings of O-ring troubles
were ignored or not relayed to launch officials.
   While grounded, NASA went through a complete shakeup, all the
way from top officials down to engineers and astronauts who left to
work elsewhere.
   Redesigning the shuttle's booster rockets and then getting them
approved for flight took longer than many within NASA had hoped.
   Morale sank even lower.
   ``In many ways, it's a thankless task. At this time of personal
tragedy and low morale, you've still got a mountain of work to
do,'' said Allen, who's still closely involved with people and
projects here at the Johnson Space Center. ``You have to tip your
hat to the NASA worker that went through that.''
   Astronauts launched themselves into higher positions in the
agency, assuming administrative and oversight roles not enjoyed
since the early days of the space program. They sat in on meetings
they had not been invited to before, and training continued on
missions slated for the next decade.
   But it wasn't until this summer that morale started to climb,
officials said.
   ``Even the last week, it (the launch) seemed remote because of
bad weather and another leak,'' Godwin said. ``Then we started
seeing things happen (in preparation for the launch) that we hadn't
seen before in the last 2{ years.''
   As Thursday's countdown progressed, the emotional mix here was
as volatile as the fuel in the giant orange external fuel tank.
   Some of the astronauts gathered in the same room where they had
viewed the Challenger launch.
   ``There was a lot of tension. It was a long two minutes. You
can't help but compare,'' said Godwin. ``Challenger could have been
any crew. I don't think anybody can be strapped in there on top of
that rocket and those boosters and not realize what you're sitting
on top of. But we get through life thinking it's not going to be
me.''
   As Discovery lifted off and cheers erupted all around the
Johnson Space Center, the flight directors in Mission Control held
back. Nary a sound, until 2 minutes, 4 seconds into flight, when
Discovery shed its solid rocket boosters safely, and applause broke
out.
   NASA, back in the saddle, contained its glee within the
statement, ``Discovery, performance nominal'' _ space parlance for
no problems.
   With Discovery's nominal performance, and landing scheduled for
Monday, the talk has shifted even beyond the next shuttle flight.
   Astronauts are already training in a mockup of a space station.
Shuttle missions are mapped out to 1992. The talk has turned back
to a space competition with the Soviets. Never, actually, was there
doubt that America would not explore space.
   ``We went to space originally out of a sense of competition,''
Allen said. ``I do believe the challenge of space is certainly
inherently great enough to challenge any particular country that
has some confidence in its destiny and even if there was a single
country on the planet, people would still go into space.''
   Wherever Discovery leads us, it surely leads us out of our
Challenger mourning. Even for some relatives of the lost crew,
Discovery may mark a final picking-up of the pieces.
   ``I hope for the (Challenger) crew, for my husband, that today
brought him a greater peace,'' Lorna Onizuka, widow of mission
specialist Ellison Onizuka, said here after the launch.
   The triumph of Discovery may bring a sense of peace to the
nation as well. The fiery explosion caused the most public deaths
for America since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
And as the Discovery launch repeated the sequence that led to that
moment of horror, many watching cried _ tears of joy, tears of fear.
   The spaceship cleared the launch tower and headed toward the
stars. About 70 seconds into flight, Mission Control radioed,
``Discovery, go at throttle up,'' a repeat of the final words sent
to the Challenger crew.
   The words were so, so familiar.
   ``Roger go!'' exclaimed commander Rick Hauck.
   Roger go, Discovery.

   The House has approved a $46.6 billion money
bill for the nation's farm programs, including for the first time a
ceiling on a major export program that has boosted overseas sales
of agricultural products.
   The House passed the measure, produced this week by a
House-Senate conference committee, Thursday by a vote of 353-35 and
sent it to the Senate.
   In a major development, House and Senate negotiators decided to
cap expenditures under the Export Enhancement Program, a major
export subsidy, at $770 million in the upcoming fiscal year.

   Prices farmers got for raw products in
September rose 0.7 percent from August, including the highest wheat
prices in almost seven years, the Agriculture Department says.
   But the rise from August to September was the smallest monthly
increase since the drought began cutting 1988 harvest prospects and
triggered rising prices last spring, the government said Thursday.
   Mostly as a result of the drought and searing heat, U.S. grain
production is expected to be down 31 percent from last year's
harvest.

   Still battling to acquire Macmillan Inc.,
British media magnate Robert Maxwell has boosted his tender offer
for the publishing and information concern to $2.51 billion.
   Maxwell's offer on Thursday is up from $2.4 billion and tops the
cash-and-stock offer Macmillan accepted earlier in the week from
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., a prominent buyout firm.
   Maxwell said he will pay shareholders $90.25 in cash for each
Macmillan share, up from $86.80 a share.

   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon said Thursday that citizens of
California would be ``substantially and irreparably harmed'' if he

   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp has said the merger
would kill competition and thus drive up prices at the checkout

<HEAD>Maxwell Raises Cash Tender Offer for Macmillan Again</HEAD>

   British publisher Robert Maxwell has turned up
the heat in the battle for Macmillan Inc., by taking a sweetened
bid that values the publishing and information company at $2.51
billion directly to shareholders.
   Minutes before the stock market closed Thursday, Maxwell boosted
his cash tender offer to $90.25 a share from $86.80 in the latest
assault in a four-month-old takeover battle.
   Traders had little chance to react to the fresh bid, which
topped a cash-and-stock offer Macmillan's board had accepted from
the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. Earlier in the week,
Macmillan agreed to be acquired by Kohlberg in a cash and
securities deal the firm valued at $90.05 a share.
   Maxwell alternatively offered $900 million for four prize
divisions that Macmillan had promised to sell to Kohlberg for $865
million in the event the firm was unsuccessful in acquiring the
company as a whole.
   Such so-called ``lock-up'' agreements generally are used to
discourage rival bidders.
   The businesses include Macmillan's direct marketing group; its
directory division, which publishes Who's Who and other
directories; the Berlitz language schools; and Michie Co., which
publishes state legal codes.
   In a ``Dear Ned'' letter to Edward P. Evans, Macmillan's
chairman and chief executive, Maxwell noted ``we have said from the
beginning, we are desirous of purchasing Macmillan Inc. in its
entirety.''
   Failing that, Maxwell offered to terminate the tender offer if
he could have the four divisions, which he dubbed Macmillan's
``crown jewels.''
   If shareholders warm to Maxwell's offer, the British publisher
could gain a controlling stake in Macmillan without the board's
approval.
   Macmillan had no comment on Maxwell's revised tender offer,
which will expire Oct. 13, unless extended.
   Earlier in the week Maxwell proposed acquiring the company for
$89 a share in a negotiated transaction and said he asked Macmillan
representatives for an opportunity to top any bid the company
received.
   ``They refused to permit this,'' he said in the letter to Evans.
   Maxwell has sharply criticized the true value of the Kohlberg
offer, contending that ``members of the financial community'' said
the package is worth less than $89 a share.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Macmillan
rose 25 cents to close at $88.87{ a share.
   Maxwell, head of Maxwell Communication Corp., had asked
Macmillan to conduct a fair auction, but his lawyers have charged
that the bidding process has been rigged.
   Maxwell said his latest offer was less conditional than the
Kolhberg offer because it was not subject to financing, ``whereas
the (Kohlberg) offer contains a broad financing condition.''
   Attorneys for the Robert M. Bass Group, which controls 9.2
percent of Macmillan and sparked the bidding war for the company
four months ago, also challenged Macmillan's lock-up agreement with
Kohlberg in court on Wednesday.
   Bass filed a motion to intervene in a case Maxwell has against
the company, and charged Macmillan directors had breached their
fiduciary duty by granting the lock-up.
   The Bass group initially offered to acquire Macmillan for $64 a
share but backed out when the stock price began to rise steeply.
   In mid-September, the Macmillan board approved Kohlberg's
initial $85-a-share proposal but withdrew its backing last week
after Maxwell raised his offer to $86.80 a share from $80.

<HEAD>Newspapers Say They Will Fight Latest Price Hike for Newsprint</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspaper executives say they're willing to
change newsprint suppliers or seek overseas paper sources in
response to another boost in North American newsprint prices, which
they claim is unjustified.
   Their reaction follows reports that major Canadian newsprint
makers, which supply most U.S. newspapers, are raising their prices
to $695 a metric ton from $650 on Jan. 1.
   Bowater Inc., the largest U.S. newsprint producer, was the
latest to notify customers on Thursday.
   ``This is the dumbest time in five years that I can think of to
raise prices and that's why I think people will resist it,'' said
one executive of a large U.S. newspaper concern, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``The threat of not renewing contracts is
big.''
   Newspaper executives say demand for newsprint is down
dramatically due largely to a fall in retail advertising and the
planned 6.9 percent increase therefore is not warranted. They also
say a buildup in newsprint inventories will enable them to cut
orders for higher-priced paper.
   Canadian companies, which provide about 56 percent of the
newsprint used in the United States, say they need the increase
because the effects of last January's 6.6 percent rise were erased
by a decline in the U.S. dollar. They also say their raw material
costs have risen.
   ``We've told our suppliers that if they proceed in the amount
and timing that they've announced that we will take whatever
methods and effort we have to take in order not to buy newsprint
from them now or in the future,'' said Homer Taylor, vice president
of supply at Knight-Ridder Inc., one of the nation's biggest
newspaper groups.
   Other media companies, representing hundreds of daily
newspapers, also said they plan to fight the increase.
   Newsprint prices have risen approximately 288 percent since
1970, when a metric ton cost $179. Prices are up more than 21
percent in the last three years alone.
   Newsprint accounts for the largest portion of the industry's
costs behind labor. It can range anywhere between 13 percent of
total publishing costs for smaller newspapers to about 25 percent
for larger dailies, Wall Street analysts estimate.
   Newspapers say their profits are being squeezed by the higher
newsprint costs combined with weakness in advertising, which
provides the bulk of newspapers' revenue.
   John Houghton, president of Quebec & Ontario Paper Co., which
also has announced a price increase, disputed the argument that
demand for newsprint was weak.
   ``This is the best balance we've had since 1981 in terms of
supply and demand,'' he said.
   Houghton argued that while retail advertising was not as strong
as in the past, ``it's already at a good level.''
   The Newspaper Advertising Bureau said advertising, including
retail, national and classified ads, was up only 3 percent in the
first quarter from a year earlier. Retail advertising was up just 1
percent.
   The American Newspaper Publishers Association, meanwhile, said
newsprint usage declined the past five months. In August,
consumption was down 4.7 percent compared with a year ago mainly
because there was one less Sunday. Without the Sunday difference,
consumption was down 1.7 percent in August.
   Eric Philo, an analyst with the investment firm Goldman, Sachs &
Co., said he did not foresee much improvement in demand well into
1989, aside from the normal pickup in the fourth quarter for
Christmas advertising.
   ``Revenue won't pick up and demand won't start growing more than
it has in the next several months,'' he said.
   Newspaper executives said they could fight the price increase by
going to suppliers who would give them discounts and better prices,
including overseas to Japan, Italy or Scandinavian countries, who
also make newsprint.
   Some analysts said newspapers might be in the position at least
to postpone the increase until later next year.
   ``If they have significant inventories built they won't be
forced to go on ordering from the higher-priced companies. They can
get tonnage from other sources at a lower price,'' said Linda
Lieberman, an analyst with Mabon, Nugent & Co.
   Analysts say with newsprint inventories are higher than normal
and capacity expanding by about 5 percent next year, newspapers may
be able to put off the price increases, at least for awhile.

<HEAD>Flamboyant Car Dealer Backs Out Of Romanian Car Partnership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACO, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maine's best-known automobile dealer has
backed out of a plan to import Romanian-built cars but his partners
will go ahead with the deal, taking possession of the first
shipment by the end of the year, according to a spokesman.
   Saco car dealer ``Jolly John'' Pulsifer said business
commitments forced him to cancel his plans to be nationwide
distributor for the four-wheel drive Aro Hunter 244, which is
manufactured in a government-owned plant near Bucharest.
   ``I'm out of the deal,'' said Pulsifer, whose nickname and his
string of car dealerships in this southern Maine city have made him
well-known throughout Maine and in neighboring states.
   ``The retailing business is getting exceedingly competitive and
needs more and more of my time. ...I gotta make decisions _ where
can I split my time the best? I can't afford to be a distributor.''
   His former partners in the American Compliance Corp. of
Scarborough, entrepreneur Arman Quaranto and developer Gavin
Ruotolo, still plan to import the car. They would be the nation's
only Aro importers, according to American Compliance marketing
director Sam Surprise.
   The four-door, four-cylinder Aro is powered by a Ford engine and
will sell for under $10,000. It will be marketed as a
less-expensive competitor to vehicles such as the Toyota 4Runner
and Nissan Pathfinder.
   The first shipment of 125 cars is expected to arrive in
Davisville, R.I., in November or December, Surprise said. He also
said he hoped 6,000 of the cars would be available within a year.
   Surprise said the cars would be sold by dealers throughout New
England, and as far west as Philadelphia. No dealers have yet
signed contracts to sell the cars, but Surprise said he expects
eventually to have 20 dealers selling the Aro.
   The Aro has a 30-year history as the working vehicle of the
Romanian Army. It also has been sold in China, Italy, Peru and
Portugal.

   The U.S. dollar was steady at slightly lower
levels in early European trading today. Gold prices also fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar could receive a boost
after the release later today of the U.S. Index of Leading Economic
Indicators. Traders said the average expectation for the August
indicators was a rise of 0.2 percent compared with a 0.8 percent
fall in July.
   However, dealers said fears of central-bank intervention were
still strong.
   In Frankfurt, traders said many corporate customers appeared to
have filled their end-of-the-month requirements are were
withdrawing from trading.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.05 yen to a closing 134.30. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 134.40 yen.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed $2.5 billion merger of Lucky and
Alpha Beta supermarket chains has been blocked by a federal judge
who maintained the deal would kill competition and severely hurt
consumers.
   In issuing a preliminary injunction Thursday, U.S. District
Judge David Kenyon ruled the proposed merger of two companies that
are among the 10 largest grocery chains in the United States
appears to violate the Clayton Antitrust Act by lessening
competition.
   Kenyon's order, contained in a 27-page opinion focusing on
supermarket competition data in California, freezes the merger
until a trial can be held on the antitrust issues. No date has been
set for a trial.
   ``This court finds that unless defendants are enjoined, the
citizens of California will be substantially and irreparably
harmed,'' said Kenyon.
   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp sued to bar the
acquisition of Lucky Stores Inc. by American Stores Co., the
Irvine-based nationwide grocery and drugstore company that owns
Alpha Beta. Van de Kamp said the merger would kill competition and
thus drive up prices at the checkout stand.
   American Stores, in a news release, vowed to appeal the decision.
   Van de Kamp said he was pleased with the judge's ruling but
cautioned that ``this is only an initial victory.''
   ``But for now, the consumers are protected,'' he said.
   Lawyers for American stores argued the merger would benefit
consumers and allow price cutting through a more efficient, joint
operation.
   They also contended American was unfairly harmed being by a
delay in its acquisition of Lucky, which is based in Dublin,
Calif., and has markets in several states. They said Van de Kamp's
suit was too late to stop a virtually completed business deal.
   Lucky agreed in May to the $2.5 billion buyout by American.
American, with 1,600 supermarkets and drugstores nationwide, rivals
Kroger Co. of Cincinnati as the nation's biggest market chain.
   The judge disagreed with American's contention that the merger
was a done deal.
   ``While the court in no way belittles the harm defendants may
suffer as a result of this preliminary injunction,'' he wrote,
``the court concludes that it is substantially less than the harm
plaintiffs would suffer if the merger is not enjoined.''
   The preliminary injunction issued by Kenyon forbids any further
action on the merger until the merits of the case are aired in
court.
   Kenyon said he considered the Alpha Beta-Lucky plans in light of
the recent purchase of 172 Safeway markets in Southern California
by the Vons supermarket chain.
   After the two combinations, Vons will have 350 stores and
Lucky-Alpha Beta would have 550.
   The attorney general also opposed the Vons deal, but
negotiations produced an agreement in principle to settle that
disute, Mary McAboy, spokeswoman for the Vons Cos., said Thursday.
She refused to reveal details of the agreement.
   Both sides in the Alpha Beta-Lucky case presented statistics on
how the planned merger would affect grocery buyers.
   Van de Kamp said Californians would have a $400 million annual
increase in grocery bills if both combinations took place. American
Stores insisted its proposal would cut prices by $50 million a year.
   Both the Alpha Beta-Lucky deal and the Vons-Safeway purchases
were approved by the Federal Trade Commission, which analyzes such
combinations for possible harm to competition. To preserve
competition, the FTC ordered Vons to sell 12 stores and American to
sell 37.
   In the case of American Stores, the FTC's decision was tentative
and a ``hold separate agreement'' was in effect.
   Kenyon said such an agreement requires the independent operation
of both chains until the merger is final.
   The judge rejected an argument by American Stores attorney Frank
Rothman, who contended the merger was complete and ``the egg has
already been scrambled.''
   ``If the court is to make a determination as to whether this
merger is anticompetitive,'' said Kenyon, ``the state is correct in
its assertion that the egg must be examined before it becomes an
omelette.''

   Inflation on the retail side stood at
3.6 percent during August in the European Economic Community,
unchanged from a year ago but up slightly from July, a report
released Friday said.
   The EEC's statistical agency, Eurostat, said the consumer price
index rose 3.4 percent in July. It said the average inflation rate
for the first six months of the year was 2.6 percent.
   Among the EEC's 12 member nations, inflation rate was highest in
Greece, where price levels rose 14 percent in August from the same
month in 1987, and lowest in Belgium, where they rose by slightly
less than 1 percent.

   Japan said that foreign access to the country's
tightly restricted rice market should be discussed at a
multilateral forum rather than just between the United States and
Japan, according to reports Friday.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita sent a letter to President
Reagan urging that the issue be discussed at the Uruguay Round of
trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a
world trade body, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   And the Foreign Ministry said that Japanese Ambassador Nobuo
Matsunaga met with Secretary of State George Shultz in Washington
to express concern about the rice issue.
   Matsunaga said U.S. demands that Japan's market be opened to
foreign rice were ``not simply a question of procedures'' under the
U.S. Trade Act, but rather ``a political issue of extreme gravity
affecting the basis of Japan-U.S. relations,'' the ministry said.
   In September, the U.S. Rice Millers' Association filed a
complaint with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative
demanding access to Japan's rice market. Matsunaga asked Shultz to
promptly dismiss the petition, the ministry said.
   Japan maintains it should be allowed to maintain
self-sufficiency in rice because of its status as a basic foodstuff.

<HEAD>Economic Forecasting Gauge Rises in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today its chief
forecasting gauge of future economic activity rose a moderate 0.4
percent in August.
   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators
may be a signal that robust growth, and the inflation that goes
with it, may require another dose of higher interest rates from the
Federal Reserve Board.
   But analysts caution against drawing firm conclusions from a
single month's figures. The index is designed to predict economic
activity six to nine months in advance and economists say it takes
three months of reports to establish a clear trend.
   In July, today's report said, the index dropped 0.6 percent
after shooting up 1.5 percent in June, the best in 18 months. The
July dip had earlier been calculated at 0.8 percent and the June
gain at 1.4 percent.
   The August index report is another piece of evidence indicating
that some analysts may have been premature in reading signs of a
slowdown in August.
   Five of the available nine components of the index contributed
to the increase, four detracted from it.
   The biggest boosts came from a drop in average weekly claims for
state unemployment benefits, from 325,000 in July to 298,000 in
August. A rise in orders for manufactured consumer goods, from
$85.2 billion to $89.3 billion last month, also was a big plus.
   Together, these two categories accounted for two-thirds of the
positive activity. Also adding to the overall increase were rises
in plant and equipment orders, in building permits and in the price
of raw materials, which is read as a sign of strong demand.
   Indicators making a negative contribution, in order of severity,
were a decrease in business delivery times, read as an indication
of slackening demand; a drop in the average workweek; a decline in
the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, and a contraction of the
money supply in inflation-adjusted dollars.
   The 0.4 percent overall increase left the index at 193.4 percent
of its 1967 base of 100.
   The August rise was a bit bigger than most analysts were
expecting. Most looked for only a slight increase or for the index
to remain flat.
   In the last week, economists have been reconsidering an earlier
judgment that this year's robust growth was beginning a welcome
cooling in August. Many now read signs of slowness as indicating a
pause in growth rather than the start of a trend.
   The August unemployment survey, the first report hailed as a
sign of a slowdown, jumped from 5.4 percent of the work force to
5.6 percent. Retail sales and growth in personal income were also
sluggish.
   Other analysts weren't so sure, pointing to continued strength
in manufacturing of ``big ticket'' durable goods and evidence that
the employment report may have been an aberration.
   Some analysts argue that the drop in jobless claims numbers
could indicate the unemployment rate increase was a fluke, caused
in part by difficulty in adjusting the statistic for seasonal
factors and in part by temporary factory layoffs caused by unusual
heat and power brownouts.
   ``People will come to realize that any slowdown will be minor at
best and won't be enough to take off price pressures,'' said Paul
DeNoon, an economist with Manufacturers Hanover.
   Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America and a former Federal Reserve Board member,
said the two sectors that have been driving the economy _ export
sales and spending by businesses to modernize and expand _ remain
solid.
   ``I don't see any evidence that either of those two engines are
slowing down to a more moderate pace,'' he said. And unless more
evidence emerges to confirm a slowdown, the Fed will be forced to
push interest rates higher, although probably not until after the
election, he said.
   The leading index, since its creation in 1948, has correctly
predicted all eight recessions. However, it also has falsely
predicted a recession four times.
   Also, preliminary estimates of the index are often revised
substantially in later months. For instance, declines were
initially reported for five straight months _ from September 1987
through January. Later revisions wiped out all but two of the
drops, in November and January.
   The index last declined for three consecutive months from June
through August 1984. The economic expansion slowed, but there was
no contraction.

<HEAD>Current Account Surplus Falls In August</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japan's surplus on its current account, the
broadest measure of trade, declined in August from both the
previous month's and previous year's levels, the Finance Ministry
announced Friday.
   But it said the country's trade surplus, a narrower measure,
grew during August from the previous year's level for the second
month in a row, moving to $6.34 billion from $6.18 billion in
August 1987.
   Finance Ministry officials said it was too early to determine
whether the long series of declines in Japan's trade surplus during
the past year is ending.
   The current account registered a $4.99 billion surplus during
the month, down from $6.48 billion in July and $5.40 billion in
August 1987, the ministry said.
   The current account includes trade in goods as well as services
plus other monetary transfers and remittances.

<HEAD>Grand Met In Deal To Sell Hotel Chain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC said today it has agreed to
sell its Inter-Continental hotel chain to the Seibu Saison Group of
Japan for $2.27 billion in cash.
   Grand Met said it also would explore joint ventures with Seibu
Saison in such areas as retailing, food, and property.
   ``Both companies are determined to use their combined skills and
experience to achieve maximum advantage in selected world
markets,'' the company said in a statement.
   The deal marks one of the largest Japanese acquisitions outside
of Japan. Heading that list is Bridgestone Corp.'s $2.6 billion
acquisition of Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. earlier this year and
Sony Corp.'s $2 billion purchase of CBS Records in 1987.
   Grand Met, the world's largest spirits company, produces
Smirnoff vodka and J & B Scotch and has interests in food and
retailing in addition to hotels. Its other businesses include Alpo
petfood and Pearle vision centers.
   Seibu Saison is one of Japan's leading operators of department
stores and supermarkets.
   Grand Met said it would achieve an after-tax profit of 500
million pounds, or $845 million, from the sale of the 100-hotel
Inter-Continental chain, which it purchased from Pan American
Airways in 1981 for $500 million.
   A Grand Met spokesman said the company likely would use the
proceeds for a future acquisition.
   Grand Met Chairman Allan Sheppard said the sale ``provides Grand
Metropolitan with a major opportunity to pursue its foods, drinks
and retailing strategies into the 1990s.''
   The company currently is embroiled in a contested bid for Irish
Distillers Group PLC, Ireland's leading whisky maker, for which
Grand Met has offered around $465 million.
   Jonathan Goble, an analyst at the London investment firm
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., said, ``Their objective is to expand
their presence in branded, consumer non-durable businesses.''
   The Grand Met spokesman, who wasn't identified in accordance
with British practice, said a joint venture with Seibu Saison Group
gives Grand Met ``an entree into Japan in those areas we're
interested in.''
   Grand Metropolitan's major presence in Japan is now in spirits.
One possible area of cooperation could involve franchising of Grand
Met's food and liquor brands through Seibu Saison Group's
substantial retail outlets, the spokesman said.
   Inter-Continental, headquartered in Montvale, N.J., runs hotels
in 47 countries. Among its best-known properties are the recently
refurbished Willard in Washington, the Mark Hopkins in San
Francisco, the Mayfair in London and the Carlton in Cannes, France.
The company also runs the 13-hotel Forum Hotels chain.
   In the year ended Sept. 30, 1987, Inter-Continental had
operating profit of 37.9 million pounds, or $64 million. Seibu
Saison has annual sales of more than 12 billion pounds, or $20
billion, Grand Met said.

<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. has folded its
supercomputer business, ETA Systems Inc., into its mainframe
operations.
   The move could mean layoffs at the unit and pose a serious
setback for ETA, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.
   Control Data also is reassigning Carl S. Ledbetter, the
president of ETA, to a marketing position within a new computer
products division. Ledbetter, 39, who came to Control Data two
years ago to run ETA, did not return phone calls Friday.
   Control Data officials wouldn't comment on possible layoffs and
other cost reductions at ETA, which is based in St. Paul.
   Control Data said that Gil D. Williams, vice president of the
computer products division, would oversee ETA and that the
supercomputer unit's vice president of operations, Al Moschner,
would assume responsibility for technical development and
administration.
   ETA was merged into a new computer products division without any
announcement in June, the Journal reported. The company disclosed
the move in response to a reporter's questions.
   In recent years, Control Data's mainframe computer business has
slipped. It serves mainly scientific niche markets and has lost
ground to larger domestic rivals.
   First-half revenue for the computer systems and services group
grew modestly and chip-production problems are delaying shipments
of a new machine, the Journal reported. As a result, an improvement
isn't expected now before the fourth quarter.
   Merging ETA with other computer operations discouraged some
analysts.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
mostly higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade in cautious
trading ahead of this afternoon's quarterly grain stocks report.
   Most of the early gains were attributed to position-balancing
ahead of the Agriculture Department report. The report will
indicate final soybean and corn stocks for the marketing year that
ended Aug. 31 and first-quarter usage of wheat, which is marketed
on a June-through-May yearly basis.
   The report was expected to show a continued drawdown of stocks
from levels a year earlier, analysts said.
   But it also could indicate that the higher prices caused by the
summer drought led to some slackening of demand during the
June-August period, said Jon Horton, an analyst in Chicago with
Research Department Inc.
   In early trading, wheat was 2{ cents to 4} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.16\ a bushel; corn was }
cent to 1} cents higher with December at $2.88\ a bushel; oats were
1{ cents lower to 2{ cents higher with December at $2.44{ a bushel;
soybeans were 3 cents lower to 7 cents higher with November at
$8.15 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of this afternoon's quarterly
USDA hogs-and-pigs report.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .13 cent higher with October at
71.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .23 cent
higher with October at 81.60 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent
lower to .15 cent higher with October at 39.60 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .75 cent higher with
February at 50.25 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   International Paper Co. will buy the USG Corp.
subsidiary Masonite Corp. for about $400 million cash, the
companies announced today.
   Masonite, headquartered in Chicago, is one of the world's
largest producers of composite wood products for the home
construction and furniture industries, with sales last year of $529
million.
   International Paper, based in Purchase, N.Y., and one of the
biggest U.S. manufacturers, has been trying in recent years to
upgrade its wood-products and related businesses, the company said
in a statement.
   Masonite is attractive because of its strong brand name and its
demonstrated technical and product development capabilities, the
statement said.
   ``Over the years, Masonite has pioneered a number of important
products for the markets it serves,'' said John A. Georges,
chairman and chief executive officer of International Paper.
``These products include laminated panels for the furniture
industry and molded door facings, which are leaders in their
respective markets and have considerable long-term growth
potential.''
   Robert J. Day, chairman and chief executive officer of USG
Corp., said, ``We are pleased with International Paper's enthusiasm
for Masonite's leadership position in the production of wood
composite products.''
   He indicated that Masonite is one of several businesses USG is
selling as part of its previously announced restructuring efforts.
Others include Kinkead Industries, The Marlite Division, and the
Construction Metals business.
   The sale of Masonite is expected to be completed by Oct. 31, the
companies said.

   The stock market pushed ahead today, extending
Thursday's rally as the pace of trading picked up.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 33.78 points on
Thursday, rose another 14.58 to 2,133.89 by noontime today on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 807 up, 445 down and
497 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 85.11 million shares at
noontime, up from 67.75 million at the same point Thursday.
   Analysts said many traders were pleased to see stock prices show
signs of life Thursday after a protracted period of little movement
on low volume.
   But they also said many market participants remained skeptical
that any fundamental shift had taken place in investors' mood.
   The government reported this morning that the index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.4 percent in August.
   The index, which is designed to detect future economic trends,
has been bouncing around erratically this year, and brokers said
investors were reluctant to infer much from its latest monthly
reading.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Motors, up { at
75; American Telephone & Telegraph, up \ at 26{; General Electric,
up \ at 44.
   Advanced Micro Devices fell 1{ to 9\ in active trading. The
company said its earnings for the third quarter might fall short of
second-quarter levels and announced plans to cut its work force,
citing disappointing sales.
   Cadnetix climbed 1 to 8\ among the volume leaders in the
over-the-counter market. Daisy Systems said it was making an
$8-a-share tender offer for control of the company.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.02 to 154.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .42 at 301.23.

   The House passed the Pentagon spending bill
today as Congress and President Reagan, hoping their election-year
budget truce holds, resumed their race against the clock to
complete work on the government's 1989 spending business.
   The House approved the $282 billion defense bill on a 327-77
vote. And Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he
believed it was likely lawmakers would finish work on all five
remaining appropriations bills in time for tonight's midnight
deadline.
   ``It shows what can happen when the president and Congress
cooperate,'' he said.
   If all 13 appropriations bills needed to keep federal agencies
running for the fiscal year that starts Saturday are enacted before
the clock strikes 12, it will mark the first on-time budget
performance since 1948.
   ``We're all goggle-eyed about that,'' said Rep. Joe Skeen,
R-N.M., ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee's
Treasury subcommittee.
   Reagan so far has signed six of the 13 measures, and two others
are sitting on his desk.
   The House passed three more appropriations bills Thursday: a
$46.6 billion agriculture measure, a $14.3 billion foreign aid
bill, and a $1.8 billion measure for Congress' own operating
expenses. The Senate planned to take up the three today.
   Congress planned to try to finish the two remaining pieces of
spending legislation today as well.
   One, providing $3.2 billion for the District of Columbia, was
awaiting resolution of a dispute over whether the city could use
federal aid or its own revenues to pay for abortions.
   Congressional leaders took up the defense spending bill after
learning that Reagan had signed a separate measure, passed
Wednesday, providing spending authority for Pentagon programs.
   Lawmakers had expected the only potentially controversial issue
to be aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   The current program of humanitarian aid to the Contras expires
today and the bill contains an amendment proposing new aid.
   The amendment _ written by Democratic leaders in both chambers _
provides $27 million in new non-lethal aid. It also proposes $16.5
million worth of military aid, including weapons.
   But the plan provides that the military aid cannot be released
to the Contras unless the Central American peace process fails and
until there is a new vote of both chambers to release the aid.
   It was possible that even if there were no serious disagreements
on the bills, the midnight deadline might not be achieved simply
because of the time it could take for Congress to pass five
separate measures.
   Reagan and congressional leaders worked all year to avoid a
repeat of last year's $600 billion catchall measure that covered
all government agencies. The enormous bill resulted from a year in
which Reagan and lawmakers fought constantly over taxes and
spending priorities.
   This year's work was eased by last November's budget summit
agreement between the two sides, in which broad spending targets
were set.
   Congressional leaders began warning lawmakers on Thursday that
they might have to work over the weekend if they did not complete
the spending measures.
   Failure to enact the remaining appropriations bills would have
little immediate effect because few government employees work over
the weekend. Agencies for whom financing has not been provided
would have to close their doors on Monday, although essential
workers _ such as the military _ would continue working anyway
under government regulations.

   Crude oil futures plummeted to their lowest
level in more than two years today as more negative news from OPEC
sent the market into a frenzy.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for November
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, hit
a low of $13.25 a barrel at midday.
   The last time the near-month contract closed below that level
was on Aug. 1, 1986, when it reached $11.55 a barrel. Prices had
fallen below $14 a barrel several times in recent weeks but
rebounded before trading sessions ended.
   ``The story is a complete breakdown in OPEC's discipline,'' said
Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
   The November crude contract dropped 19 cents Thursday to settle
at $13.92. That was the lowest settlement price for a near-month
contract since $13.73 price of Oct. 29, 1986.
   Analysts said statements from OPEC Secretary General Subroto
that Saudi Arabia was increasing its oil output sent the market
into a frenzy.
   Subroto's acknowledgement that world oil prices probably would
be weak for the long-term indicated the unlikelihood that
discipline would be restored anytime soon, analysts said.
   Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, has taken the lead in the past in
bringing other members back to their assigned quotas.
   Saudi Arabia is said to have recently joined the United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq in exceeding their quota, leading to
speculation that the Saudis are trying a new strategy to force OPEC
members to rein in oil production.
   But Subroto said in an interview that the move could send prices
into a tailspin, to as low as $5 a barrel, if the Saudis used their
available capacity.
   In other trading Thursday, prices for refined oil products rose.
Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery closed up 0.25
cent at 46.42 cents a gallon. Other contract months were lower.
   October heating oil rose 0.04 cent to 39.54 cents a gallon, and
other monthly contracts also advanced.
   Analysts said the gains in gasoline stemmed from the recent
hurricane threat in the Gulf of Mexico when refineries and oil rigs
halted operations.
   API statistics released Tuesday showed that although gasoline
inventories were up 2.2 million barrels on a weekly basis to 219
million barrels, they were 10 million barrels below the same period
a year earlier.
   Brokers said crude prices continued deteriorating, reflecting
investor concern over the surplus of oil on world markets.
   ``It's a continuation of the same old junk we've seen for the
last four weeks,'' said Bud Degorgue, a trader with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   Analysts have said there is an excess of more than 1 million
barrels a day of oil on world markets. Recent meetings of members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have not
resulted in any concrete steps to restrain output, pushing prices
lower.

   In vetoing the textile protection bill President
Reagan might have reopened one of the most divisive and emotional
issues between liberals and conservatives.
   The issue is bound to play a major role in the presidential
debates because it is one that interests almost everyone. Oddly, it
is also one on which many people seem unable to make up their minds.
   One side believes religiously that to protect textiles is to
protect jobs; the other believes it costs jobs. One side believes
protection is a prop to the American economy, the other says it
costs every American dearly.
   It is a regional issue as well, since many of the textile jobs
that would be protected by import limitations are in the South. But
there is another side of the job picture: It might cost jobs in the
North and elsewhere.
   The bill vetoed by the president would have further limited
textile, apparel and footwear imports, already strongly protected.
In fact, it is sometimes said that no other country has a bigger
tariff wall.
   The issue is loaded with misconceptions, the very largest of
them being one held over for decades, including the 1930s, when the
textile industry was indeed in trouble. But it is far less troubled
today.
   Edward L. Hudgins of the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative-oriented think tank that often takes a pro-business
position, recently issued a paper stating that ``the American
textile and apparel industry clearly is an industry that doesn't
need help.''
   The industry, he states, is working at near maximum capacity _
95 percent, compared with the mid-80s for all domestic
manufacturing. It is using more wool, cotton and man-made fibers
than ever before. Employment is up; 21,000 new jobs were added last
year. Textile profits are up as well. So are exports.
   Let's keep it that way, say those who view a healthy textile
industry as necessary for certain regional economies. Times were
not always good; in fact, they say, they were dismal until
protection put the industry on its feet.
   Perhaps, say the freetraders, but consider the cost. Hudgins
says American consumers pay between $25 billion and $30 billion
annually in higher prices due to these restrictions.
   In addition, there may be a cost to non-textile areas _ in jobs.
Nancy Oliver, policy analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy,
another conservative think tank, contends that textile
protectionism costs more jobs than it saves.
   The legislation just vetoed, she says, would have protected
fewer than 46,700 textile, apparel and footwear jobs, but would
have destroyed more than 52,400 retailing jobs that depend on
imports.
   She estimates the protection price tag for each of these 46,700
jobs could be as much as $262,000 a year, a figure so enormous it
provokes comparison with the $17,000 average annual pay scale for
each job. A bad bargain, she suggests.
   Such arguments, however, may be ignored when the debate is
graphically and personally described. A job lost anywhere _ and
jobs are lost in areas where textile companies falter _ is an
upsetting experience for other Americans.
   A feeling of patriotism also enters the debate, especially when
Americans sense they are being exploited by low-wage foreign
manufacturers. A feeling of brotherhood exists, not just on the
part of workers but employers, too.
   High as the cost might be, therefore, it is conceivable that
many Americans might be willing to pay the price of protectionism,
so long as the dollar total remains obscured by other parts of the
debate.

   Negotiators for Caterpillar Inc. and the
United Auto Workers union today agreed to extend their contract
indefinitely while barganing continued toward a new pact, avoiding
a midnight strike deadline, officials said.
   The move will keep some 17,500 Caterpillar workers in five
states on the job while negotiations continue.
   A midnight strike deadline still loomed for farm equipment maker
Deere & Co., which is negotiating with the UAW on a new labor pact
near the company's Moline, Ill., headquarters.
   The Caterpillar extension came less than 12 hours before the
current labor agreement was to expire and follows two months of
unsuccessful negotiations between the union and Caterpillar _
world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment _ and the
union.
   The decision to extend the negotiations puts on hold strike
plans by the company's blue-collar workforce in factories in 12
cities in Illinois, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Tennessee.
   Each side must give five days' notice if they wish to terminate
the agreement, said Bill Price, assistant to the bargaining
committee chairman for UAW Local 974, which represents 10,033
Caterpillar workers in Peoria.
   ``We just found out,'' Price said. ``It couldn't have been more
than 15 minutes ago.''
   Main union objectives included merit pay increases for the first
time in a decade, 100 percent job security, a reduction in overtime
and call-back of 1,000 laid-off UAW members.
   The union reportedly was seeking a 3-year pact and a 3 percent
wage increase in each year of the agreement.
   Caterpillar officials have taken a position of holding down
costs and in past talks sought more flexibility in job assignments
and scheduling, as well as a more simplified grievance procedure
and new guidelines for overtime.
   The company wants to restrict employee mobility, saving money on
retraining and getting more productivity out of its workforce.
   On Thursday, UAW officials at Deere plants in Iowa reported an
unusual amount of overtime and double shifts recently as Deere, the
leading manufacturer of farm tractors and agricultural implements,
struggled to meet back-orders in the face of a possible strike.
   ``Our people have had a lot of overtime,'' said Jerry Niedert,
vice president for UAW Local 838 in Waterloo, Iowa. ``There has
been overtime in all areas. It's excessive.
   ``We've got people working 16 hours a day, double shifts. Some
guys are working seven days a week. We're talking lots of people _
hundreds.''
   Niedert said the 5,300 union workers at five Deere plants in
Waterloo are ready to walk out if a new work agreement isn't
reached when the contract expires.
   Karl Mantyla, UAW spokesman in Detroit, said the union is not
interested in extending Deere's labor contract.
   Larry Solomon of Local 751 in Decatur, Ill., said he also favors
no extension.
   ``If we let them drag their feet now, they're just going to keep
on dragging their feet,'' Solomon said. ``Who knows when we'll get
an agreement.''
   Brian Alm, a Deere spokesman, rejected Niedert's contention that
the overtime was designed to build company inventories in the event
of a walkout. He said a settlement is expected before the deadline.
   ``We've been selling everything we can get our hands on,'' Alm
said. ``In some areas, we've got a back-order situation.''
   The UAW-Deere talks affect about 13,400 active employees, and
4,000 laid-off workers, at 11 cities in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota,
Colorado and Georgia. Deere employs about 38,000 employees
worldwide.
   UAW officials have been meeting with Deere since Aug. 11 at a
negotiating site a few miles from the company's world headquarters
in Moline.
   Deere workers want to restore salary cuts suffered in their 1987
contract. They also want 100 percent job security and pension
improvements.
   As the Caterpillar talks continued, workers in Peoria-area shops
read about the talks in a special ``negotiations extra'' newsletter.
   In the publication, Tony Green, president of the Peoria-area
local which represents about 10,000 employees, warned his troops to
be ready to walk out if no settlement is achieved.
   Dated Sept. 21, the letter instructs union members of their duty
to strike, how to collect strike pay and other issues.
   ``If a strike occurs, believe me, it will not be the fault of
the UAW, but Caterpillar Inc.'s fault,'' Green said in a signed
column.
   Another column, by John Hankins of the bargaining committee,
portrayed the UAW-Caterpillar talks as terse exchanges.
   ``The company sets there and says `I hear you. Not interested,'
'' Hankins said.
   Meanwhile, negotiators continued to study the latest offer from
Caterpillar, which company spokesman Mark Polzin described as ``a
significant modification'' of earlier offers.
   UAW spokesman Jack Roberts said the union spent much of the day
writing a counterproposal which was presented to the company in an
evening meeting.

   The stock market gained more ground today,
extending Thursday's rally as the pace of trading picked up.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 33.78 points on
Thursday, rose another 12.09 to 2,131.40 by 2 p.m. today on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 9 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 887 up, 508 down and
477 unchanged.
   Analysts said many traders were pleased to see stock prices show

   But they also said many market participants remained skeptical
that any fundamental shift had taken place in investors' mood.
   The government reported this morning that the index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.4 percent in August.
   The index, which is designed to detect future economic trends,
has been bouncing around erratically this year, and brokers said
investors were reluctant to infer much from its latest monthly,
finances and activities.
   If the church shuts its doors, Denys plans to stay in the parish
and continue his own outreach to his flock of 250 Dutch, Belgian,
Filipino and Latvian immigrants.
   But Denys, 68, fears his other mission _ organizing weekend
spiritual retreats to help struggling youths in the predominantly
black neighborhood _ will die.
   ``We're going to try to change the recommendation,'' he said.
``We still have a little time.''
   Szoka has said the appeals process could save some parishes from
being closed.
   For Denys, himself a Belgian immigrant, his appeal is his only
hope of persuading Szoka to spare his ethnic congregation in a city
that boasts the nation's largest settlement of Flemish Americans
from Belgium.
   To survive the winnowing process, a church must have a yearly
income of $100,000 with at least half collected in offerings. Our
Lady of Sorrows earns half that, but the minister said members have
kept the church free of debt.
   ``We always make ends meet,'' Denys said.
   He said the archdiocese built a new sanctuary 21 years ago, and
just last week the church won a city beautification award after
volunteers landscaped the yard.
   ``They were willing to build a church here, and now they're
willing to close it?'' Denys said.
   Gillespie, a church member since 1959, said she'll cling to her
rosary and her faith and believe in a miraculous solution to the
church's dilemma.
   ``When you trust in God, things happen,'' she said.

<HEAD>Saison of Japan To Buy Inter-Continental Hotels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC said Friday it was selling
its Inter-Continental hotel chain to Seibu Saison Group of Japan
for $2.27 billion in cash in one of the largest foreign
acquisitions by a Japanese company.
   Both companies also agreed to explore joint ventures in areas
such as retailing, food, and real estate.
   Grand Met said the Inter-Continental sale will give it an
after-tax profit of 500 million pounds, or around $845 million,
most of which will be used for future acquisitons. It bought the
100-hotel chain from Pan American Airways in 1981 for $500 million.
   Inter-Continental, based in Montvale, N.J., runs hotels in 47
countries. Among its best-known properties are the recently
refurbished Willard in Washington, the Mark Hopkins in San
Francisco, the Mayfair in London and the Carlton in Cannes, France.
   Grand Met Chairman Allan Sheppard said the sale ``provides Grand
Metropolitan with a major opportunity to pursue its foods, drinks
and retailing strategies into the 1990s,'' a plan outlined in a
recently announced restructuring.
   The company currently is embroiled in a contested bid for Irish
Distillers Group PLC, Ireland's leading whisky maker, for which
Grand Met has offered around $465 million.
   Grand Met, the world's largest spirits company, makes Smirnoff
vodka and J & B Scotch and has interests in food and retailing in
addition to hotels. Its other businesses include Alpo petfood and
Pearle vision centers. Annual sales total about $10 billion.
   Seibu Saison has interests in real estate, leisure hotels,
restaurants and food manufacturing. It has annual sales of about
$20 billion.
   Japanese companies have taken advantage of the strength of
Japan's economy and the Japanese yen in recent years to emerge as
big buyers of foreign companies and real estate.
   The Inter-Continental deal marks one of the largest Japanese
acquisitions outside of Japan. Heading that list is Bridgestone
Corp.'s $2.6 billion acquisition of Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.
earlier this year and Sony Corp.'s $2 billion purchase of CBS
Records in 1987.
   ``This is an important and logical step in the
internationalization of our hotel and other group interests,'' said
Tatsuo Aoki, a Seibu Saison director. ``Access to Grand
Metropolitan's wide interests in many sectors and our own retail
strengths in Japan form the basis of an excellent alliance.''
   A Grand Met spokesman said joint ventures with Seibu Saison
gives the London company ``an entree into Japan in those areas
we're interested in.''
   Grand Met's major presence in Japan is now in spirits. One
possible area of cooperation could involve franchising of Grand
Met's food and liquor brands through Seibu Saison Group's
substantial retail outlets, the spokesman said.
   Jonathan Goble, an analyst at the London investment firm
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., said, ``Their objective is to expand
their presence in branded, consumer non-durable businesses.''
   The sale of Inter-Continental is scheduled to be completed Dec.
15, subject to the approval of Grand Met shareholders.

   The stock market showed a moderate gain today,
extending Thursday's rally as the pace of trading picked up.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 33.78 points on
Thursday, rose another 9.42 to 2,128.73 by 3 p.m. today on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 856 up, 564 down and
483 unchanged.
   Analysts said many traders were pleased to see stock prices show
signs of life Thursday after a protracted period of little movement
on low volume.
   But they also said many market participants remained skeptical
that any fundamental shift had taken place in investors' mood.
   The government reported this morning that the index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.4 percent in August.
   The index, which is designed to detect future economic trends,
has been bouncing around erratically this year, and brokers said
investors were reluctant to infer much from its latest monthly
reading.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Motors, up | at
75[; American Telephone & Telegraph, up \ at 26{, and International
Business Machines, up | at 116.
   Advanced Micro Devices fell 1| to 9[ in active trading. The
company said its earnings for the third quarter might fall short of
second-quarter levels and announced plans to cut its work force,
citing disappointing sales.
   Cadnetix climbed 1[ to 8] among the volume leaders in the
over-the-counter market. Daisy Systems said it was making an
$8-a-share tender offer for control of the company.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.67 to 154.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .63 at 301.44.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 144.91 million shares with an
hour to go.

   A federal inspection of 35 commuter airlines
has produced nearly a dozen cases of records being falsified and
problems with managing maintenance and operations.
   The special inspections by the Federal Aviation Administration
were announced last March and covered about 20 percent of the
commuter airline industry, which last year carried more than 31
million passengers.
   It was prompted by concern over a spate of commuter aircraft
accidents in which 56 people were killed during a four-month period
in late l987 and early 1988.
   A report on the inspections is scheduled to be completed by
December, but FAA officials provided a broad description of the
findings at a congressional hearing earlier this week and in
interviews Thursday.
   According to the agency, of the 35 commuter carriers inspected,
one airline _ Air New Orleans _ has voluntarily surrendered its
operating license and another, which was not identified, may be
forced to shut down.
   The FAA said six other airlines voluntarily turned in their
operating certificates as commuter carriers before an FAA
inspection of their operations could get under way, although two of
them denied the report.
   The FAA identified the airlines as Arctic Circle Air, AvAir,
Dade Helicopter Jet, Exec Express, Texas National Air and Grand
Canyon Airlines.
   The agency on Thursday had said a seventh carrier, South Pacific
Island Airways, also had surrendered its commuter operating license
but FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said today that upon further checking
it had been determined that the airline had not done so and
continues to operate commuter flights in American Samoa.
   Meanwhile, Texas National denied that it had relinquished its
commuter license. But Farrar said FAA records show the airline had
surrendered its certificate that had allowed it to provide
scheduled commuter service, although he said the airline continues
to provide on-demand air taxi service.
   Brian Loflin, corporate communications director for Fairchild
Aircraft Corp. of San Antonio, Texas, said today that subsidiary
Texas National got out of the commuter business in August but did
not surrender its certificate and continues as a charter service.
   Glenn Schaab, president of AvAir, said that airline surrendered
its certificate to the FAA in June, but the action had ``absolutely
nothing'' to do with the impending FAA inspection of the
financially struggling carrier.
   ``We had sold the flight operations portion of the company ...
and didn't need the certificate anymore,'' Schaab said in a
telephone interview from Raleigh, N.C.
   A sightseeing aircraft belonging to Grand Canyon Airlines
collided with a helicopter over the Grand Canyon in June 1986,
resulting in 25 deaths. It was not clear whether Grand Canyon's
surrender of its commuter certificate affects its sightseeing
operation.
   The FAA said at least three of the carriers _ AvAir, Dade
Helicopter Jet and South Pacific Island _ already had been under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, in which a company seeks court
protection from its creditors until it can develop a plan to get
its finances in order.
   AvAir last year carried 351,522 passengers and was the 30th
largest commuter in the country, according to a ranking by the
Regional Airline Association.
   None of the other airlines subject to the inspections was
identified.
   Commuter airlines, which normally fly aircraft of 30 seats or
fewer, have taken on an increasingly important role in air travel
since many of the larger airlines no longer fly into small
communities.
   In testimony before a House investigations subcommittee on
Wednesday, FAA officials said as many as 200 enforcement actions
may come out of the inspections of the 35 airlines.
   John S. Kern, acting deputy associate administrator for
regulations and certification, told the panel that in some cases
irregularities were immediately corrected by the airlines ``and in
some instances enforcement actions have been initiated.''
   Kern provided no details as to the infractions found at the
commuter airlines, but described the findings in broad terms,
saying a detailed report was expected to be available by December.
   He said the inspections focused on management, maintenance,
quality control procedures and record keeping because preliminary
studies indicated those to be likely problem areas.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Eastern Decision to Lay Off 3,000</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 5-8, The three-judge, with further quotes; Also

   A federal appeals court today upheld Eastern
Airlines' decision to lay off about 3,000 employees when it
eliminated service to 14 cities, ruling that an injunction against
the furloughs was illegal.
   The ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here struck down
a decision last month by a lower court judge who had barred the
financially troubled airline from carrying out the layoffs.
   The three-judge panel ruled unanimously that the layoffs were
not an unlawful change in working conditions under the Railway
Labor Act, which controls labor relations in the airline industry.
   The court also concluded that the dispute between Eastern and
the unions ``was a minor one under the Railway Labor Act.
Accordingly, the district court was without jurisdiction to enter a
preliminary status quo injunction under Section 6 of the act.''
   The three-judge panel rejected the union's contention that the
layoffs were part of an illegal campaign by Eastern's parent, Texas
Air Corp., to undercut the power of organized labor at the
financially troubled carrier.
   The unions ``have directed our attention to nothing that would
undermine Eastern's claim that legitimate business concerns provide
an ample reason for these reductions,'' the court said.
   The judges noted there is not a claim ``that Eastern has
tailored its reductions so as to impose a differential impact on
union members. Indeed it appears that the furloughs affect union
members and non-members in roughly their propotions of Eastern's
workforce.''
   There was no immediate comment from Eastern or representatives
of the three unions that brought the suit.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker last month allowed Eastern
to stop service to 14 cities and close its Kansas City hub but he
barred the carrier from proceeding with the layoffs without
negotiating the cuts with its unions.
   The appeals court had stayed Parker's order and allowed Eastern
to furlough the employees provided it post a $4.7 million bond to
cover a month's pay in case the unions prevailed.
   The financially troubled airline, which was purchased in 1986 by
Texas Air Corp., had contended that it had not violated federal
labor law provisions that it maintain current working conditions
when it announced the layoffs in July.
   The company cited a previous layoff since 1980 as evidence of a
pattern of lawful furloughs.
   But three unions, the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers, the Air Line Pilots Association, and the
Transport Workers Union of America, contended that layoffs were
part of a union-busting campaign orchestrated by Texas Air's
chairman, Frank Lorenzo.
   The company contended that in order for it to survive it needed
the freedom to exercise legitimate business judgments, such as
deciding to go ahead with the layoffs.
   The elimination of service to 14 cities is part of Eastern's
attempt to streamline its operations and concentrate on its most
profitable routes along the East Coast and to Latin America.
   The airline contends the service cuts will result in annual
savings of $50 million in operating and $7 million payroll expenses.
   Service was eliminated to Albuquerque, N.M., Fort de France,
Martinique; Las Vegas, Nev.; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Oklahoma City;
Omaha, Neb.; Dallas; Point-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe; Reno, Nev.; San
Antonio, Texas; San Diego; St. Lucia, West Indies; Tuscon, Ariz.;
and Tulsa, Okla.

   Wheat futures prices closed modestly higher but
corn, oats and soybeans finished mixed Friday on the Chicago Board
of Trade in cautious trading ahead of the Agriculture Department's
report on U.S. grain stocks.
   Analysts attributed virtually all the activity to
position-balancing in advance of the quarterly grain stocks report.
   ``I didn't hear a thing'' about any other factors that
influenced trading during the session, said Steve Freed, grain
market analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   The report showed soybean stocks at 302 million bushels, down
from 655 million in the June report and 436 million a year earlier.
   The USDA estimated corn stocks at 4.26 billion bushels, down
from 5.83 billion on June 1 and 4.88 billion a year earlier.
   Wheat stocks were estimated at 2.24 billion bushels, compared
with 1.27 billion in June and 2.96 billion a year earlier.
   The soybean figure was well above most pre-report estimates and
traders pronounced it bearish for soybean prices. The corn and
wheat figures fell at the low end of pre-report estimates and were
said to be bullish.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 3\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.14{ a bushel; corn was 1{
cents lower to 1{ cents higher with December at $2.86{ a bushel;
oats were 4 cents lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.41{ a
bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents lower to 6 cents higher with
November at $8.12 a bushel.

<HEAD>Luxury Hotel Chain Sells for $613,000 a Room</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At an average per-room price of $613,000 _ room
service not included _ the sale of the posh Inter-Continental chain
is just the latest in a series of deluxe hotel properties to be
snapped up at top dollar.
   The purchaser, Japan's Seibu Saison Group, is in fine company.
   Last year the Sultan of Brunei paid $757,000 a room for his name
to appear on the deed to the Beverly Hills Hotel, affectionately
dubbed the ``pink palace'' by the polo crowd, and real estate
developer Donald Trump added New York's French Renaissance-style
Plaza Hotel to his glitzy empire for an average $495,000 a room
earlier this year.
   The prices seem preposterous to industry observers.
   ``It's just off the chart,'' said Joseph J. Doyle, a senior vice
president at the investment firm Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.,
referring to the $2.27 billion that Seibu will pay _ in cash _ for
the 100-hotel Inter-Continental chain.
   Doyle estimated the chain will make just $90 million this year,
putting the sale price at an astronomical 25 times net income. ``A
more reasonable multiple would be 10 or 18 times net,'' Doyle said.
   The chain's occupancy rate is unimpressively average at about 70
percent. And while its flagship hotels _ namely the recently
refurbished Willard in Washington, San Francisco's Mark Hopkins,
and the Mayfair in London _ are unmistakably luxurious, Doyle said
most others in the chain cater more to the businessman than the
carriage trade.
   What may be most attractive about the chain is that it is
international in scope.
   ``There's a scarcity of luxury international hotel chains in
general, and those that do exist are seldom offered for sale,''
said Thomas McConnell, a manager of the hotel consulting group at
the accounting firm Laventhol & Horwath.
   Investors who purchase a chain buy into a well-rounded business
with wide expansion possibilities, while those like Trump who buy
single hotels are far more limited in what they can do to develop
the operation.
   But if buyers are unhappy, hotels generally are easy to sell.
When Allegis Corp. announced last year it would sell its Westin
hotel chain _ which included the Plaza _ buyers from around the
world rushed to make bids.
   The chain went to Aoki Corp. of Japan and the Robert M. Bass
Group of Texas for $2 billion. Allegis also sold its Hilton
International chain to Britain's Ladbroke Group PLC for $1.07
billion.
   Also enhancing their value, top-tier hotels are almost certain
to sit on valuable real estate, which is destined to appreciate
over time.
   ``Another longer-term dimension that buyers may be looking
toward is if the world should get back to a high inflationary
environment, these hotels would be a hedge _ their earnings would
grow rapidly,'' Doyle said.
   But perhaps most important is the intangible aura of status that
comes with owning a luxury hotel. These buyers ``want trophies,''
Doyle said.
   Indeed, McConnell said, ``There's a lot of panache to owning a
hotel _ you can put your name on it; you can bring your friends
there; you can live there.''
   To underscore the interest people have in the industry,
McConnell noted that there is even a TV show about a hotel. ``You
don't see a TV show called `Malls,''' he said.
   Whether a hotel is profitable depends on its occupancy rate and
its average room price. Few properties make money on the food they
serve, no matter how pricey.
   Luxury hotels, whose rates typically start at $200 a night in
major cities, have the benefit of a high degree of repeat
customers. ``People are willing to pay a luxury rate because they
want to see a certain level of service over and over again,''
McConnell said.

   The stock market closed out the third quarter of
1988 in typically indecisive fashion Friday, yielding to some late
selling after a broad early advance failed to stand up.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 18 points at
its midsession high, closed with a 6.40 loss at 2,112.91.
   That left the average up 22.23 points for the week, but down
18.67 from its midyear level three months ago.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in the
daily tally of nationwide trading in New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 853 up, 613 down and 478 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came 175.75 million shares,
up from 155.79 million Thursday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in
NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional
exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 205.42
million shares.
   Analysts said many traders were pleased to see stock prices show
signs of life Thursday, when the Dow Jones industrials climbed
33.78 points, after a protracted period of little movement on low
volume.
   But they also said many market participants remained skeptical
that any fundamental shift had taken place in investors' mood.
   The government reported Friday morning that the index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.4 percent in August.
   The index, which is designed to detect future economic trends,
has been bouncing around erratically this year, and brokers said
investors were reluctant to infer much from its latest monthly
reading.
   Energy stocks were weak as oil prices fell on talk of increasing
production among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. Exxon lost { to 44}; Amoco { to 73}; Mobil \ to 42|;
Texaco [ to 45\, and Atlantic Richfield [ to 77].
   Advanced Micro Devices dropped 1{ to 9\ in active trading. The
company said its earnings for the third quarter might fall short of
second-quarter levels and announced plans to cut its work force,
citing disappointing sales.
   Middle South Utilities rose { to 15. The stock, which traded as
low as 7} last winter because of problems facing some of the
company's subsidiaries, responded to news of a restored dividend of
20 cents a share to be paid in the fourth quarter.
   Cadnetix climbed 1{ to 8} among the volume leaders in the
over-the-counter market. Daisy Systems said it was making an
$8-a-share tender offer for control of the company.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $1.50 billion, or 0.06
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .21 to 153.57.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 1.01 to 311.67, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down .68 at 271.91.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 1.66 to 387.71. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 301.63, up .82.

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold Prices Fall On OPEC Leader's Comments</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Precede LONDON BC; Subroto, one name, is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply Friday as plunging oil
prices unleashed trader fears that interest rates would fall in the
United States.
   Gold prices also fell as cheaper oil raised the prospect of
lower inflation. Gold, traditionally bought as a hedge against
inflation, was quoted at $394 a troy ounce at Republic National
Bank in New York at 4 p.m. EDT, down from $396.50 late Thursday.
   Oil futures tumbled after the secretary-general of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Subroto, said crude
prices could plunge to $5 a barrel if Saudi Arabia switches to full
production capacity.
   Subroto said the Saudis might increase production to convince
OPEC members who violate their export quotas that all producers
would lose if they did not honor their OPEC output ceilings.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price for the near-term
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
dropped 55 cents to close at $13.37 a 42-gallon barrel.
   Oil futures have been skidding recently because of the
oversupply of crude on world markets, so the prospect of full
output by the Saudis, the world's largest oil producer, raised the
possibility of a collapse in prices.
   ``The low oil prices dominated the market today,'' said Ronald
Holzer, chief dealer at Harris Trust & Co. in Chicago.
   Oil prices are a barometer of inflation. Lower inflation usually
leads to lower interest rates, which is a bearish sign for the
dollar.
   Overseas, dealers also attributed the dollar's slide to comments
about the U.S. currency by Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha
Seger. She said a sharp rise in the dollar would put the brakes on
U.S. economic expansion.
   Her comments caught foreign exchange markets by surprise and
spurred a dollar selloff late in the European trading day.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.05 yen to a closing 134.30 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 134.40 yen, and in New York, it slumped to
133.75 yen from late Thursday's 134.37.
   In London, the dollar dropped against the British pound. It cost
$1.6905 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6825 late
Thursday. In New York, the pound climbed to $1.6935 from $1.6810
late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.8690 West German marks, down from
1.88265; 1.5830 Swiss francs, down from 1.59425; 6.3595 French
francs, down from 6.4065; 1,393.50 Italian lire, down from
1,402.25; and 1.21675 Canadian dollars, down from 1.21825.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8725 West German marks, down from 1.8823; 1.5830
Swiss francs, down from 1.5930; 6.3700 French francs, down from
6.4055; 2.1185 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1210; 1,396.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,402.60; 1.2171 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2175.
   Precious-metals dealers said gold prices seem unlikely to revive
to $400 per troy ounce in the near future.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold fell to $394.40 a
troy ounce from late Thursday's $396.80.
   Gold dropped in London to a late bid price of $394.45 a troy
ounce, compared with late Thursday's $397.75, and in Zurich, the
metal closed at a bid $396, compared with $397.50 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.47 to close at a bid $399.16.
   Silver fell to $6.135 a troy ounce on the Comex in New York from
late Thursday's $6.173. In London, silver traded at a late bid
price of $6.14 a troy ounce, compared with Thursday's $6.20.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose sharply Friday as tumbling oil
prices convinced traders that they are not likely to be stung soon
by rekindled inflation.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond jumped $7.50 per $1,000 in face
amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, plunged
to 8.98 percent from 9.06 percent late Thursday.
   Oil prices fell through the $14-a-barrel level Thursday for the
first time in more than two years and weakened further Friday, with
the near-term contract closing at $13.37 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Lower energy prices could translate into lower inflation, which
makes fixed-income investments such as bonds more valuable.
   Jay Goldinger, an economist at the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based
Capital Insight Inc., noted that oil prices took a dive at midday.
``That triggered an almost simultaneous rise in bond prices,'' he
said.
   Bonds successfully held onto those gains for the rest of the
session. Trading was fairly active.
   Analysts said government reports that showed a rise in a key
economic forecasting gauge and home sales in August, possible signs
of a strengthening economy, had no impact on the credit markets.
   ``The economic indicators were exactly where everybody estimated
they'd be,'' said Anthony Naylor, a senior vice president at Rodman
& Renshaw Inc.
   Analysts said some money managers may have been realigning their
porfolios over the past week to show a more conservative bent for
the third quarter. Hence, they may have been purchasing bonds
before the quarter drew to a close Friday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose [ point to 7-32 point, intermediate
maturities rose 7-32 point to 15-32 point, and long-term issues
jumped 1 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service
reported.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton composite Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 4.24 1,146.48.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities also
strengthened. Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which
measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of
five years or longer, rose 1.87 to 291.60.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills compared with late Thursday
fell to 7.48 percent and the discount was down 2 basis points at
7.25 percent. Yields on six month bills fell to 7.84 percent and
the yield was down 2 basis points at 7.45 percent. Yields on
one-year bills eased to 8.11 percent and the discount fell 4 basis
points to 7.55 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 percent, down from 8]
percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Gold Holds Its Own Depite Plunging Oil Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices declined slightly Friday on New York's
Commodity Exchange but analysts said the gold market displayed
unexpected strength in the face of the oil market's collapse to new
two-year lows.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mostly higher;
grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated.
   Precious metals prices usually follow the oil market closely.
Metals traders consider the price of crude oil a good inflation
barometer and gold is considered a good investment hedge against
rising prices.
   But Friday's plunge in oil prices created only a moderate stir
in the precious metals markets, where sharp declines have been
expected daily since gold slipped below $400 a troy ounce last week.
   Instead of plunging along with oil, gold futures settled only
$2.40 to $3.10 lower, indicating the metals market is stronger than
it appeared to be a week ago.
   ``Had it not been for oil, the precious metals might have tried
to hold their own today,'' said George Anagnos, metals analyst with
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   He said the most recent economic statistics, including Friday's
report of a moderate 0.4 percent rise in the leading economic
indicators, indicate inflation may not be as tightly constrained as
many believe.
   James Steel, metals analyst with Refco Inc. in New York, said
strong buying surfaced in the active December gold contract at $400
early in the session. Gold for delivery in December rallied to
$403.20 before the oil market collapsed and pulled it down to an
ending price of $399.20.
   The spot October gold contract settled at $394.40.
   Steel said he remained bearish on gold, but acknowledged that
``it's been making rallies; it showed a lot of strength today.''
   Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with Josephthal &
Co. in New York, said he expected December gold to close above $400
early next week.
   Silver settled 4 cents to 5.1 cents lower, with December at
$6.225 a troy ounce.
   Oil prices fell in a selling frenzy sparked by reports that OPEC
Secretary General Subroto had said Saudi Arabia was increasing its
oil output.
   Subroto said the move could send crude-oil prices, which already
have been severely pressured by OPEC overproduction, to as low as
$5 a barrel.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 44 cents to 61 cents
lower with November at $13.37 a barrel; heating oil was 1.28 cents
to 1.50 cents lower with October at 38.04 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.15 cents lower to 1.47 cents higher with October at
47.89 cents a gallon.
   Pork futures rallied in a final day of position-squaring ahead
of the Agriculture Department's quarterly hogs-and-pigs report,
which was released after the close and is expected to spark heavy
selling on Monday.
   The report's tally of hogs and pigs in the 10 largest
pork-producing states was close to pre-report estimates. But the
market was surprised by the larger-than-expected number of pigs
that producers expect to be born from Sept. 1 of this year through
February 1989.
   Most traders had expected hog farmers to scale back their
farrowing intentions because of the drought, resulting in smaller
supplies of slaughter-ready hogs next spring and summer, analysts
said.
   Live cattle settled .08 cent lower to .65 cent higher with
October at 71.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to 1.05
cents higher with October at 82.45 cents a pound; hogs were .30
cent lower to .90 cent higher with October at 39.60 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.17 cents to the limit 2 cents higher
with February at 52.32 cents a pound.
   Wheat futures moved modestly higher but corn, oats and soybeans
finished mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade in cautious trading
ahead of the Agriculture Department's report on U.S. grain stocks.
   The report, issued after the close, showed soybean stocks as of
Sept. 1 at 302 million bushels, down from 655 million in the June
report and 436 million a year ago. The figure was well above most
pre-report estimates and traders pronounced it slightly bearish for
soybean prices.
   The USDA estimated Sept. 1 corn stocks at 4.26 billion bushels,
down from 5.83 billion on June 1 and 4.88 billion a year ago.
   Wheat stocks as of Sept. 1 were estimated at 2.24 billion
bushels, compared with 1.27 billion in June and 2.96 billion a year
ago.
   The corn and wheat the low end of pre-report
estimates and were called slightly bullish.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 3\ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.14} a bushel; corn was } figures fell at cent
lower to 2
cents higher with December at $2.85} a bushel; oats were 2\ cents
lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.41{ a bushel; soybeans
were 2 cents lower to 5{ cents higher with November at $8.13 a
bushel.
   Stock-index futures retreated moderately on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of
stocks represented by the Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 1.55
points lower at 274.15.

<HEAD>Defense Appeals to Higher Court To Have Judge Removed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. filed an
extraordinary appeal late Friday seeking disqualification of the
judge hearing the federal government's huge fraud case against the
Wall Street firm.
   Their petition to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reflected the aggressive approach that Drexel's defense team has
taken in fighting the Securities and Exchange Commission's sweeping
allegations since they were announced Sept. 7.
   The defense attorneys asked the appellate court to order U.S.
District Judge Milton Pollack to disqualify himself on grounds that
his wife has a financial interest in a company with business ties
to Drexel.
   They said in the appeal this ``raises a conflict of interest
requiring his immediate recusal.'' Recusal is a legal term meaning
disqualification on grounds of prejudice.
   While the position of Pollack's wife might appear to bias the
judge in Drexel's favor, defense lawyers could fear that if he
issued a ruling beneficial to them it could be overturned by a
higher court.
   Other attorneys, however, said privately they believed the
defense move actually was aimed at provoking Pollack into anger and
thereby forcing the judge to disqualify himself anyway. The
81-year-old jurist is known for his no-nonsense approach and strict
rulings in securities-fraud cases.
   The Drexel appeal was extraordinary because no substantive
issues have even been decided in the case. Appeals courts usually
do not intervene in lower court proceedings until a decision is
rendered.
   Pollack has scheduled his own hearing Oct. 11 on earlier defense
requests for him to step aside because of his wife's financial
interest in the Drexel-financed company, Palais Royal of Houston
Inc.
   The judge was out of town Friday and unavailable for comment on
Drexel's appeal, his secretary said. Since the appeal was filed
late in the day, it was unclear how or when the higher court would
respond to it.
   Earlier Friday, lawyers familiar with the pretrial legal
maneuvering said the Drexel defense also was seeking to not only
oust Pollack from the SEC case, but from related suits as well.
   ``They have now expanded the recusal warfare to include not
merely the SEC suit, but all the class actions filed and
consolidated,'' said David Berger, one of the main lawyers
representing groups that have sued Drexel. ``They're trying to get
rid of one of the most respected judges in the United States.''
   Thomas Curnin, a leading Drexel attorney in the case, confirmed
the defense team had undertaken to remove Pollack from all related
litigation but would not elaborate.
   Pollack was assigned the SEC-Drexel case because he had been
hearing other civil suits in which defendants include Drexel and
Ivan F. Boesky, the now-jailed speculator who turned state's
evidence and implicated the firm in a litany of fraud allegations
that range from insider trading to cheating clients. Drexel has
denied the allegations.
   Curnin also confirmed reports Friday that the SEC had requested
documents and other materials from Drexel concerning securities
besides the 19 mentioned in the enforcement agency's original
allegations.
   The SEC's requests also include information concerning any
surveillance or other investigation of Boesky undertaken by Drexel,
Curnin said.
   Asked if the SEC move represented a possible broadening of the
case against the firm, Curnin said he did not believe so but said
it ``may be designed to achieve the same results.''
   Many lawyers familiar with the SEC-Drexel fight say they think
the government has leaked sensitive details about the investigation
as part of an effort to pressure the firm and other defendants into
settlement negotiations.
   The SEC and the U.S. attorney's office, which is widely known to
be conducting a grand jury investigation into Drexel activities,
have denied they are the sources of any leaks.

<HEAD>Zenith Sues To Block Proxy Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp. sued Thursday
to block an investment group's attempt to wage a battle for control
of the company, and contended the group only was interested in
boosting the price of its stock.
   The company filed a federal lawsuit in Chicago to prohibit the
group, Brookhurst Partners, from waging a proxy fight against
Zenith management until it completely and accurately complied with
federal disclosure requirements and from disseminating documents
relating to any offer to buy Zenith.
   The suit also seeks a declaration that Zenith may refuse to
recognize the results of any proxy vote or any purchases of its
stock by Brookhurst until 30 days after the defendants comply with
federal disclosure requirements.
   Brookhurst, which controls 6.1 percent of Zenith's stock and is
the company's biggest shareholder, is attempting to wage a proxy
fight to force the sale of Zenith, the last U.S. maker of
televisions.
   The partnership on Thursday filed a motion in Delaware Chancery
Court seeking the elimination of Zenith bylaws that restrict the
rights of stockholders to act by written consent.
   The motion also seeks the elimination of Zenith's stockholder
rights plan, a so-called ``poison pill'' designed to deter hostile
takeovers by diluting the value of a company's holdings.
   The stockholder rights plan gives Zenith the right to exercise
its takeover defense if any one shareholder gains written consent
from 15 percent of the shares.
   Brookhurst also wants copies of the Zenith's shareholder lists
and financial records.
   A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 5 in Chancery Court concerning
the shareholder lists.
   Brookhurst filed the motion in state court one day after a
federal judge dismissed the group's federal suit, which contained
similar complaints, on jurisdictional grounds.
   Brookhurst is seeking shareholder consent to trim Zenith's board
from 10 directors to six, and to fill three of those seats with
nominees committed to selling Zenith.
   Zenith's lawsuit claimed Brookhurst Partners had ``deliberately
conveyed ...the false impression that they are planning to acquire
or broker the acquisition of Zenith or some portion of its
business.''
   Zenith contends, Brookhurst actually seeks to artificially
inflate the price of Zenith's stock by creating the impression that
Zenith is ``in play,'' so members of the group can sell their
shares ``at a quick profit.''
   Brookhurst said in a statement that Zenith's lawsuit was
``groundless'' and reiterated its call for Zenith's management to
detail its plans for returning the battered company to profitablity.
   Unless Zenith reveals such a plan, the dissidents said, they
would continue their drive to sell the company.

   Caterpillar Inc. and the United Auto Workers
agreed Friday to extend their contract indefinitely, averting a
midnight strike, while negotiations continued at Deere & Co.
struggling to beat the same deadline.
   The extension agreement between Peoria-based Caterpillar and the
UAW came just 12 hours before the current contract would have
expired, possibly triggering a walkout by 17,500 blue-collar
Caterpillar workers in five states.
   The negotiations were recessed with no time set for a resumption.
   But at Deere, the possibility remained for a strike by 13,400
workers at midnight CDT, as negotiations continued near the
company's headquarters in Moline, Ill.
   ``We're continuing to talk as planned,'' said Robert Combs, a
Deere spokesman. ``We're meeting right now. I'm sure they'll
continue to meet through the day. I think it's significant that
talks picked up right away this morning.''
   Elliott Anderson, a chief UAW negotiator in the Caterpillar
talks, said the union decided to concentrate its efforts on Deere
and would likely use a settlement with Deere as a ``pattern'' for
future talks with Caterpillar.
   At both Deere and Caterpillar, job security, increases in pay
and pensions, a reduction in overtime and a callback of laid-off
workers were at issue. Neither the union nor the companies would
reveal their specific contract proposals.
   A Deere walkout would affect 13,400 factory workers in 11 cities
in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Colorado and Georgia. The company
employs about 38,000 people worldwide.
   Karl Mantyla, a UAW spokesman in Detroit, said the union was not
interested in extending Deere's contract. ``It's a hard and fast
deadline, as far as we're concerned,'' he said.
   Elliott Anderson, a chief UAW negotiator at the Caterpillar
talks, said the union was shifting all of its attention to Deere
because ``we think that's the best place where we've had some
movement.''
   Anderson said the union likely would use a settlement with Deere
as a ``pattern'' for talks with Caterpillar. ``We're going to take
a look at Deere and see what we can do about doing the same thing
here,'' he said.
   UAW officials began meeting daily with Deere on Aug. 11, seeking
to restore salary cuts accepted in the 1987 contract.
   At the Caterpillar talks in the St. Louis suburb of Bridgeton,
Mo., which began Aug. 4, union bargainers have been seeking the
first merit pay raise in 10 years for workers at plants in 12

Caterpillar has 58,800 employees worldwide.
   During the 1986 negotiations, the previous contract was extended
four times before a settlement was reached without a strike.
   The extension requires each side to give a five-day notice if
they wish to terminate the agreement, said Mark Polzin, a
Caterpillar spokesman.
   Although workers for both companies were drawing up their
picket-duty rosters and making other strike preparations, there was
a universal desire to avoid a walkout.
   But some workers preferred a walkout to a contract extension and
that view was apparent Friday in some Caterpillar shops.
   ``I don't think the reaction will be good among the working
people, the people in the plant,'' said Ed Woker, vice president of
Local 751 in Decatur, Ill. ``There's a lot of hard feelings. The
issues are there and they feel that there should be a settlement.''
   Philip Euler, at Local 2096 in Pontiac, Ill., said: ``I've
talked to people here and they're not happy. Everybody feels
there's been adequate time to settle this thing. To make this
indefinite does not make them happy. Nobody wants a strike, but
nobody wants an extension.''
