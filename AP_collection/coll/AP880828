   Three Italian fighter jets crashed
during an air show at a U.S. military base Sunday, and one swooped
into the crowd and burst into a huge fireball. At least 46 people
died and hundreds were hurt, officials said.
   Several children and the three aircraft pilots, members of a
famed aerial stunt team, were among the dead at the Ramstein Air
Base, about 60 miles southwest of Frankfurt, authorities reported.
   A giant ball of flame engulfed fleeing spectators when one
aircraft hit the ground, sending many screaming with their clothes
on fire. Television footage showed cars and trucks in flames.
   Some people stood in shock as a thick cloud of smoke enveloped
them, and others ran toward the scene to administer aid.
   News reports said 500 people were injured, nearly half of them
hospitalized.
   ``It was horrible, horrible, a huge shock,'' said Krista Banks,
a West German who works as a waitress at the base. ``It's going to
take a long time to forget this.''
   West German officials estimated the size of the crowd at the air
show at 200,000, and said most were Americans and Germans.
   U.S. and West German officials said the cause of the triple
crash was unknown and the exact sequence of events was unclear.
   But it appeared two of the Aermacchi MB 339As collided head-on
during a complex manuever by the 10-aircraft stunt team, then
crashed away from the crowd.
   A third jet veered uncontrollably out of formation, flames
spewing from its fuselage, and headed toward the crowd, then
exploded into a huge fireball an estimated 100 feet high.
   The Ramstein air show has drawn protests for several years
because of possible dangers to civilians. Demonstrators already
were protesting outside the base's gates as Sunday's air show began.
   West German Defense Minister Rupert Scholz immediately canceled
an air show by West German warplanes planned for September, and
asked the country's NATO partners to consider ``following these
same measures for the time being.''
   Mrs. Banks, wife of an American who is a U.S. Army employee,
said she was in the control tower when the accident occurred.
   ``There was a big flash of flame and smoke, and people were
running away. Everyone at the tower was in shock,'' said Mrs. Banks.
   ``We saw the fireball racing toward us, so we first threw
ourselves down on the ground,'' said Detlef Hosser, cameraman with
the ARD television network.
   Television footage had one man frantically shrieking ``Tanya,
Tanya'' and thousands of others screaming and looking for friends
and family members.
   Hans-Juergen Vollmer, spokesman for the Kaiserslautern
administrative area that includes Ramstein, said he believed the
crash started from a pilot's mistake.
   ``It looks as though it (the accident) was caused by pilot
error,'' he told The Associated Press.
   The three jets were part of a 10-plane Italian Air Force
demonstration team, ``Frecce Tricolori,'' that was flying 65 yards
above the ground.
   The ``Frecce Tricolori,'' which means Tri-Color Arrows and
refers to the three-colored Italian flag, was founded in 1930 as a
school of aerobatics. Since 1956, it has been a separate unit of
the Italian air force based at Rivolto.
   Ramstein Air Base spokesman Doug Moore said ``those dead on the
ground are a mix of civilian and military.''
   AFN, the U.S. military radio network, said late Sunday the
latest confirmed death toll was 46.
   About 500 people were injured, the West German television
network ZDF said late Sunday. The Norddeutschfunk radio station
said about 230 people were still hospitalized, many with serious
burns.
   ``A large number has serious burns,'' said police spokesman
Willi Hollaender in nearby Kaiserslautern.
   ``There are many children among the dead and injured,'' said
Kris Kumpf, a German medical assistant who helped treat the
injured. ``The worst part of it is, we're still trying to find some
of the parents,'' she said, trying to hold back tears.
   She said most of the injured had badly burned backs from when
they turned and tried to run away from the flaming jet.
   Moore said investigators were still piecing together the
sequence of events. He said it was not certain whether all three
planes collided at once or whether two first hit each other and the
third later become involved.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said the planes apparently were
participating in a difficult heart-shaped maneuver when the
collision occurred.
   It said the maneuver involves nine aircraft flying toward the
runway and then climbing. At a certain point in the ascent, they
break into two groups that form giant loops and then pass each
other in opposite directions. A solo flier passes through the
formation to add drama.
   It said the disaster at Ramstein apparently happened when the
two groups of planes were passing each other at about 250 mph.
   The agency did not cite its sources, but it said the conclusion
was based on the first examination of films of the crash arriving
in Italy from West Germany.
   Willi Hollaender, a police spokesman in Kaiserslautern, told the
AP that the planes involved were Aermacchi MB 339As, a two-seat
attack aircraft that the Italian air force also uses for pilot
training.
   Officials identified the three pilots killed Sunday as Lt. Col.
Mario Naldini, 41, Lt. Col. Ivo Nutarelli, 38, and Capt. Giorgio
Alessio, 31.
   The accident is believed to be the worst air show disaster
involving spectators in history. In September 1982, 46 people
aboard a U.S. Army helicopter carrying skydivers crashed during an
air show in Mannheim, West Germany.
   Several groups, including the environmentalist Greens party of
West Germany, oppose military air shows because of the potential
for such accidents.
   The crash sparked new calls for a ban on air shows.
   ``The events at Ramstein confirm in a really horrible way how
dangerous such spectacles are even for civilian observers,'' said
Walter Kolbow, a federal lawmaker for the opposition Social
Democratic Party.

   The communist leaders of Hungary and
Romania held their first summit conference Sunday in 11 years.
Talks reportedly centered on Romania's plan to raze thousands of
villages populated by ethnic Hungarians.
   Hungarian Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz said Romanian
President Nicolas Ceausescu was receptive to the idea of Hungary
sending a team to Romania to examine the village demolition and
resettlement project.
   Grosz was interviewed by Hungarian television and radio from the
town of Szeged near the Romanian border. He was returning to
Hungary after more than eight hours of talks with Ceausescu in the
Romanian city of Arad, 25 miles from the frontier.
   But Grosz indicated relations between the Warsaw Pact allies are
still strained, saying it had been agreed that consular offices of
the two countries would not be reopened.
   Last week Hungarian authorities described as ``a crime against
humanity'' Ceausescu's plan to demolish 7,000 of Romania's 13,000
villages and to resettle the inhabitants, many of them ethnic
Hungarians.
   Hungarians have long said the estimated 1.7 million ethnic
Hungarians in Romania are discriminated against and the
announcement by Ceausescu in March that the village demolition and
resettlement project should be completed by the year 2000 drew
fierce criticism here.
   Hungary claims the project, which would resettle villagers into
agro-industrial centers, wiould destroy ethnic culture and
traditions.
   Grosz said the nationality question dominated about one third of
Sunday's talks and the resettlement plan was a ``major question of
course.''
   He said his delegation proposed that Hungary send a delegation
made up of local council officials, members of Parliament and
Communist Party workers to look at the resettlement plans and ``see
for themselves how the program is shaping up.''
   Grosz indicated progress on the issue of reunification of
families separated by nationality policies. He said more than
17,000 Romanians, presumably of Hungarian orgin, have sought refuge
in Hungary.
   ``If there are family reunion requests they (the Romanians) will
be partners to it,'' Grosz said. ``This is something that they
promised.''
   He said Hungary agreed to drop the issue of reopening consulates
and cultural centers because of Romania's ``position of principle .
.. to close every kind of consulate.''
   Following a demonstration by some 50,000 people in Budapest in
June, Ceausescu reacted by closing Hungary's consulate in
Cluj-Napoca in Transylvania where many members of the Hungarian
minority live.
   Grosz said the next high-level bilateral meeting would be held
in 1989. ``There is a lot we don't know about each other and
ignorance will not broaden ties,'' he said.
   The meeting Sunday was the first Romanian-Hungarian summit since
1977 when Ceausescu met Grosz' predecessor Janos Kadar.
   Ceausescu, who surprised the Hungarians Thursday with his
invitation to the talks, called them a new beginning that started
``in a positive way,'' according to a Hungarian radio broadcast. It
did not elaborate.

   Rain-induced floods across the country
have disrupted transportation, put parts of the capital under water
and killed up to 111 people, the news media reported Sunday.
   The Inqilab newspaper said 111 people have perished in the
week-long flooding including 59 victims who drowned Saturday.
   Government Relief Ministry officials said they had reports of
only 24 drownings on Saturday and that would put the week's death
toll at 76.
   Torrential rains have pushed the Ganges, Brahmaputra and scores
of other rivers over their banks.
   Some streets in the old part of Dhaka remained under water
Sunday. In a few districts residents residents used boats to make
their way through the winding lanes.
   Railroads and highways have been heavily damaged. Rail service
was stopped Saturday from Dhaka to the north and to the
southeastern port of Chittagong.
   At Manikganj, 65 miles west of Dhaka, police contacted by
telephone said five people drowned near the city when their boat
capsized in the Ganges River on Saturday. Inqilab said 33 people
drowned Saturday near Manikganj, one of the few flood-stricken
areas with telephone lines still open to Dhaka.
   The Relief Ministry estimates that 250,000 people have taken
refuge in government relief camps in the past week.
   The government Flood Forecasting Center predicted Sunday that
rivers would continue to rise in the next three or four days.
   Heavy rains and flooding are common during the summer monsoon in
Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest nations.
   Floods in June and July killed 260 people, according to
newspaper reports.
   Last year more than 1,200 people died in floods in Bangladesh.

   A tropical storm rolled ashore Sunday,
bringing heavy rain and strong winds that destroyed more than a
dozen mobile homes, killing one person, and left thousands
temporarily without power.
   Just six hours after Tropical Storm Chris became the third named
storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season early Sunday, it moved
over land and weakened. But it still packed enough power to
devastate trailers in a sparsely populated wooded area about 75
miles inland from this historic port city.
   ``The winds took a swath, probably a half a mile long and a
quarter of a mile wide,'' said Clarendon County Fire Chief Carter
Jones. He said one person was killed and another seriously injured
in a mobile home three miles south of Manning, and a dozen or more
trailers were destroyed in a sales lot.
   The winds snapped tree limbs across eastern South Carolina, and
tornadoes associated with the same weather pattern tore up trees
and roofs in North Carolina.
   The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning
from Savannah, Ga., to Cape Hatteras, N.C., for much of the day. By
6 p.m., the storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression,
located near Columbia with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph in
squalls.
   The hurricane center warned of coastal flooding and recommended
that small craft stay in port from Brunswick, Ga., to Virginia
Beach, Va., until winds and seas subsided.
   Rain from the storm was expected to reach as far north as
northern New Jersey, southeastern New York and Long Island by
Monday, the weather service in New York City said.
   Winds measured in gusts up to 44 mph in Charleston cut power to
an estimated 18,000 customers in coastal South Carolina and
destroyed one mobile home and overturned another near the community
of Olanta near Florence.
   The storm, which had maximum sustained wind of 50 mph while over
the ocean, rolled over land at 20 mph shortly after noon, the
National Hurricane Center said.
   ``It's such a weak storm. There's no eye or anything like
that,'' said forecaster John Townsend of the weather service in
Charleston. ``The only thing we're worrying about is some flooding
due to rainfall and tides.''
   The weather service said 1.72 inches of rain fell between 5:45
p.m. and 6:45 p.m. in the Columbia area and produced standing water
on roads, including Interstate 26, that contributed to traffic
problems and accidents.
   Forecasters predicted 3 to 5 inches of rain along the storm's
projected track across South Carolina and into North Carolina.
   Sheriffs' dispatchers said tornadoes uprooted trees, damaged
mobile homes and tore shingles off roofs but no injuries were
reported in Alexander, Catawba and Iredell counties in western
central North Carolina.
   ``They're not directly associated with Chris, but the flow
pattern around the storm brings in moisture from the Atlantic and
that's what causing this kind of thing,'' said Bob Muller of the
National Weather Service at the Raleigh-Durham Airport.
   Damages were estimated as high as $1 million in Iredell County,
where wind threw a tractor-trailer rig into a building at Iredell
Container Co. in Statesville, said Al Warlick, a spokesman for the
state Department of Crime Control and Public Safety.
   A tornado in Cumberland County damaged four houses in a
subdivision and destroyed a produce stand north of Fayetteville,
authorities said.
   Steve Vann, 21, of Goldsboro, said he was helping his uncle move
into a home when a tornado ripped apart Percy Currin's produce
stand.
   ``I seen it hit the ground about 3:30 p.m. The wind got to
whipping up pretty good, clouds moving in a tornadolike motion,
then it quit raining. All of a sudden, it came out of nowhere,''
Vann said. ``It sounded just like somebody throwing a match on
gasoline _ Whoosh!''
   Scattered power outages affected about 12,000 South Carolina
Electric & Gas Co. customers in the Charleston and Beaufort areas,
said Becky McSwain, a spokeswoman for the utility, which serves
about half the state.
   During Saturday and into early Sunday, Chris strengthened into a
tropical storm from a lopsided tropical depression that threatened
Florida's eastern coast. Depressions are upgraded to tropical
storms when their maximum sustained wind hits 39 mph, and to
hurricanes when sustained wind blows at least at 74 mph.
   On Saturday, the system drenched the Bahamas with about 5 inches
of rain.
   Earlier the depression, which began forming one week ago Sunday,
dumped 6.6 inches of rain on Puerto Rico, causing mud slides and
flooding that killed at least three people and damaged more than
100 homes, Civil Defense officials said.
   The last named storm to hit South Carolina was tropical storm
Kate in 1985, which came ashore as a hurricane in the Florida
panhandle. That storm flooded roads, left thousands without power
and was blamed for at least one death in South Carolina.

   Burundi's foreign minister said Sunday that
authorities had stopped the violence in that central African
nation, where at least 5,000 people were killed in battles between
rival tribes.
   Cyprien Mbonimpa told reporters, ``There are currently no more
killings, no more bloodshed.''
   He spoke to reporters after an hour-long meeting with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Mbonimpa, replying to a question, said Burundi would not accept
an international inquiry into the killings by members of the Hutu
and Tutsi tribes that began two weeks ago.
   He said he had asked Perez de Cuellar's backing for Burundi's
appeal for $15 million in emergency aid, with the money to provide
food and clothing for three months for 100,000 people left homeless.
   Mbonimpa said people displaced inside Burundi are returning
``hour by hour'' to their villages.
   More than 40,000 people fled into neighoring Rwanda to escape
the massacres.
   The Hutu and Tutsi have been rivals for centuries. The Hutu form
a majority in Burundi but the Tutsi tribe dominates the government
and army.
   Mbonimpa said the death toll may be higher than the 5,000
reported last Monday by the government but there is no new official
figure.
   The violence began Aug. 14 in two communities in northern
Burundi, according to refugees in Rwanda.
   They said army units controlled by Tutsi officers were sent
north to restore peace and the soldiers opened fire on the Hutu.
   Mbonimpa repeated a claim by Burundi's leader, Maj. Pierre
Buyoya, who last week blamed the massacres on dissident Hutus he
said infiltrated Burundi from Tanzania and provoked anti-Tutsi
actions.
   ``When the rebels had already killed thousands, the army was
ordered to intervene,'' he told reporters at the U.N. office in
Geneva. He did not elaborate on who the rebels were or where they
came from.
   ``Certainly there were dead (people killed by soldiers) because
the army was obliged to use force to repulse the rebels,'' he said.
``The army's other mission was to protect and help those who were
fleeing.''
   ``The Burundi army is one of the most disciplined armies and
there never is any loss of control,'' he added. ``To gain control
of a situation in three days requires a disciplined and well
controlled army.''

   Bankruptcy court officials predict the
drought will force hundreds of Midwestern farmers who might
otherwise have survived financially to abandon their fields after
the coming harvest.
   After a sharp drop in bankruptcy cases in the first half of
1988, courts throughout the Farm Belt expect a surge in bankruptcy
petition filings in the next six months, even with help from the
huge federal drought assistance bill, according to officials in
Iowa, South Dakota and Wisconsin.
   ``The figures looked so promising, but with what's happened this
summer we're not going to bump along with this low figure,'' said
Ann Manley, chief clerk of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Madison.
   Michael Duff, an assistant to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's assistant secretary for economics, said farm
bankruptcies linked to the drought would increase nationwide later
this year, stunting an economic upturn in the farm economy that
began in late 1987.
   ``Last year debts were actually less than receipts and land
values stabilized. But historically, anytime you have a drought the
numbers go up and down,'' Duff said. ``There were probably a number
of farmers on the line, having a make-or-break-you year and they
probably will go bankrupt or quit.
   ``We don't have any way of knowing how many, but it will be a
national kind of problem,'' Duff said.
   The Madison court, which handles bankruptcy petitions involving
individuals, businesses and farms for 44 of Wisconsin 72 counties,
received 154 petitions from farmers the first seven months of the
year. That compared with 293 for the same period last year.
   Since 1985, farm bankruptcies have made up 13 percent to 16
percent of total cases in the Madison district. There were 420 in
1985, 511 in 1986 and 448 last year.
   ``I'll predict filings will more than double by the end of the
year,'' Ms. Manley said. ``We'll be around 400 again.''
   Barbara Everly, chief clerk of the U.S. Bankruptcy court in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said she expected a 20 percent increase in
bankruptcies this winter.
   ``You're not only talking about farms, but it may be the final
blow for implement dealers and service stations and the convenience
stores in those small farm communities that have been on the
edge,'' said Everly.
   As in Wisconsin, Everly said farm bankruptcies in Iowa so far
this year have fallen well below previous levels. She said climbing
land values in the state and an improving farm economy had eased
financial woes.
   But now, with crops stunted or wiped out and many farmers still
owing the costs of seed and fertilizer, ``I expect that lenders are
getting terribly, terribly jumpy,'' she said.
   Ed Jesse, a University of Wisconsin agriculture economist,
called the drought ``a major setback'' to an agriculture economy
that began improving late last year.
   ``A lot of them are just going to have to call it quits,'' Jesse
said.
   In South Dakota, farm bankruptcies were down by almost 78
percent the first seven months of the year.
   Pat Naylor, deputy clerk for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Sioux
Falls, S.D., said 61 farm petitions had been filed through July,
compared to 311 for the same period a year ago.
   South Dakota was among the early states hardest hit by the
drought.
   However, Judge Irvin Hoyt of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Pierre, S.D., said the number of farm bankruptcies would depend on
the eligibility and timing of federal drought aid to farmers.
   President Reagan signed the $3.9 billion drought assistance bill
Aug. 11, and the government hopes to begin taking applications by
Oct. 1. Under the law, aid to farmers who lose more than 35 percent
of their expected harvest will cover 65 percent of that lost
income. For farmers who suffer crop losses of more than 75 percent,
the aid would equal 90 percent of the lost income.
   ``Until we know exactly ... when (aid) will be available,
particularly for those in bankruptcy who must modify their plans,
we won't know what's going to happen with filings,'' Hoyt said.
   Farmers generally file Chapter 11 petitions, which grant
protection from creditors and create a plan for debt payment, or
Chapter 12 petitions, which were created in 1986 in the Family Farm
Act.
   Chapter 12 petitions generally resemble Chapter 11 petitions,
but proponents say they give the debtor stronger control over the
payment schedule and use a trustee, generally an attorney, to
administer it.
   Chapter 11 and 12 debt payment plans can be modified to fit
unexpected economic troubles and even allow payments to be
temporarily suspended. But the huge financial losses anticipated in
the drought may require payments to be reduced or suspended for so
long that creditors might urge liquidation, said Mark Bromley, a
Lancaster attorney who handles farm bankruptcies.
   Creditors ``would have a strong argument that the (normal
bankruptcy) plan simply won't work,'' Bromley said.
   ``My greatest concern would be for the people already in
bankruptcy. In some cases, payment plans may have to be modified to
drastically reduce or suspend payments for a year,'' Bromley said.
   Bromley and Hoyt also said that next spring's operational costs
for feed, fertilizer and other items may be too high for some under
present plans and reduced income.
   ``Buying at higher costs will throw those plans and cash flows
back into court for modifications,'' Bromley said.
   Bromley said he's had relatively few consultations with farmers
about financial problems this summer.
   ``I think the reason is it's so hard out there, so beyond the
experience of most farmers, that they want to wait and see where
things fall,'' he said.

   Executions are down this year, even in
the nation's capital punishment capital, as courts ``fine-tune''
the laws and death-row inmates wait to see what effect that will
have on their cases.
   In Texas this year, only Robert Streetman has been belted to the
gurney and executed by injection, while eight convicts have been
put to death nationally. Last year, Texas accounted for six of the
25 U.S. executions and 10 of 18 in 1986.
   Since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the death penalty legal in
1976, 101 inmates have been put to death, 27 of them in the Lone
Star State.
   ``It's kind of like everybody is saying: `OK, let's wait a
minute,''' said James Beathard, an inmate on the Texas death row.
   ``Texas has a great deal to do with it,'' Tanya Coke, research
director for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said of the lull. ``The
courts heard major death penalty cases which challenge the
constitutionality of the Texas law and essentially held them up.''
   This summer, however, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the death
sentence of Donald Gene Franklin for the 1975 murder of a nurse,
and Assistant Attorney General Bob Walt said Franklin and others
will run out of time later this year.
   ``I think you're probably going to see three or four by the end
of the year,'' Walt said. ``Franklin is an absolute certainty.''
   Nationwide in the last year, many court opinions in death
penalty cases went against the states, Walt said.
   ``There seems to be a little bit of fine-tuning in state
statutes,'' he said.
   In the Franklin case, defense attorneys argued that the jury
that voted for the death penalty was prevented from giving full
consideration to mitigating circumstances, or factors suggesting
life in prison as more appropriate.
   During the trial, Franklin's attorneys had suggested the judge
instruct the jury on how to handle mitigating circumstances, but he
refused.
   Death penalty opponents now are pinning their hopes on a new
Texas case the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear. Attorneys for
Johnny Penry contend he should not be executed for a 1979 murder
because he is mentally retarded.
   Arguments in the Penry case won't be delivered until later this
year with no immediate ruling likely.
   ``Franklin, although portrayed as a bad decision, was a good
case,'' said Scott Howe, an attorney with the Capital Punishment
Clinic at the University of Texas Law School. ``People got a stay
on the Franklin issue. We're hoping most people get a stay on Penry
now.''
   The ruling in the Franklin case came eight months after he was
scheduled to be executed.
   On death row, inmates are just pleased the issue remains active.
   ``We're back eight months now when we were talking about
Franklin,'' said inmate Lester Bower. ``Now we're talking about
Penry and we have not even had a test case on it yet.''
   Of execution dates pending in Texas, Walter Bell's on Sept. 13
is considered the most serious. Bell was convicted of the 1974
slaying of a Port Arthur couple.
   ``He's on his second time through (the appeals process),'' Walt
said. ``Historically, he has a greater chance'' of being executed.
   But Howe said questions raised in Bell's appeal are very good
since they are similar to Penry's. ``He's mentally retarded,'' he
said. ``There's a question, if applied to Bell, whether the Texas
statute is constitutional.''
   Those involved in capital punishment matters agree that
election-year politics is really not a factor.
   ``Republicans (generally pro-death penalty) are eager to make it
a difficult issue on Democrats (generally anti-death penalty),''
Ms. Coke said. ``But in terms of real impact on cases, no.
   ``Death penalty law is complex and constantly evolving and as
soon as a court hands down a new procedure, it seems a new case
comes along that breaks the mold. I think the courts' struggles
with capital punishment attest to human frailty. It's simply
impossible to reduce to a legal formula decisions of life and
death.''

<TEXT>
   Africanized ``killer bees'' are
spreading north and will arrive in the United States in less than
two years despite efforts to stop them or alter their behavior,
officials say.
   The bees killed one resident of Tapachula, a town near the
Guatemalan border, when a man tripped on an unseen hive. They also
have harassed herds of cattle and made grazing difficult as far as
650 feet from a hive.
   The Africanized bees are descendants of African bees that
escaped during an experiment in Brazil. They mate with local bees,
spawning new generations that are more aggressive and dangerous to
handle, make less honey and pollinate crops less efficiently.
   ``Mexico will be `Africanized' without a doubt. It is a fact we
cannot change,'' said Dr. Martha Noemi Zapata, president of the
Tapachula Agricultural Association, in a recent interview. She said
the bees will continue north ``as far as the cold allows.''
   ``Hundreds of hives migrate to the north, but we don't know how
many,'' said beekeeper Gil Tobias, covered from head to toe with
Africanized bees as he demonstrated new safety procedures.
   Since honey is Mexico's second biggest agricultural export after
milk, the invasion has researchers searching for ways to protect
the industry.
   Beekeepers here are learning to work in heavy veils, boots,
suits and gloves that make them look a bit like astronauts about to
undertake a space walk. They use smoke in an effort to stupefy the
bees.
   Researchers also are sneaking into hives to replace Africanized
queen bees with their sweeter-natured cousins and are trying to
saturate some areas with European beehives.
   ``We're hoping to dilute the African genetic content,'' said Dr.
Ernesto Ugalde, supervisor of several bee-control centers. ``We can
do it if we can stabilize the population of European bees.''
   The Africanized bees began their spread in Brazil in 1956, when
specimens of an African bee escaped during an experiment. The bees
started breeding with local bees of European origin, creating the
Africanized, or ``killer'' bee.
   They new bees advanced slowly at first, but reached Mexico in
December 1986. U.S. and Mexican officials tried to stem the tide by
dangling bee traps from trees and wiping out hives across the
narrowest point of Mexico, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.
   The barrier didn't work.
   ``By the time it was ready, the bees had already crossed,'' said
Zapata.
   The bees have been spotted in the states of Tabasco and
Veracruz, the heart of Mexico's honey industry.
   ``The bees will be in the United States by 1990,'' Dr. Gustavo
Rodriguez Eres, Mexican director of a joint U.S.-Mexican bee
control program, said in an interview in Mexico City.
   The bees are expected to spread into the southern United States,
but cannot survive cold weather as well as their European cousins.
   Experts say beekeepers will just have to learn to live with
killer bees.
   Aside from the research program in Tapachula, about 12 miles
from the Guatemalan border in Chiapas, the southernmost state of
Mexico, programs are being conducted in the state of Veracruz on
the Gulf of Mexico and on the Pacific coast in the state of Oaxaca.
   Experts say their best hope is to cross-breed the Africanized
bees with the European honey bee, diluting aggressive characterics.
Eres said much of the bees' aggressiveness has been controlled in a
cross-breeding experiment.
   But more important, he said, was the bees' effect on honey
production. The African bees accumulate less honey than the
European bees because they spend more time defending their hives,
he said.
   ``The Africanized bee simply has a marked defensive instinct
that makes it easier to irritate and more aggressive when
bothered,'' Eres said.
   About 47,000 Mexican families, most of them peasants in areas of
subsistence farming, are in the honey business.
   Mexico has about 2.7 million beehives and is the world's fourth
largest honey exporter after the United States, the Soviet Union
and China, according to official figures. Honey exports bring in
about $50 million a year.
   The U.S.-Mexican control program is run jointly by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and the Mexican Department of Agriculture
and Hydraulic Resources. It has a budget of about $2.6 million this
year, Eres said.

   Jerry Gray, the Associated Press bureau chief in
Nairobi, Kenya, traveled to Burundi, where at least 5,000 people
were reported killed in fighting between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes.
Here is his story.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By JERRY GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NGETA, Burundi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The killings began here, in lush banana
groves and behind the walls of neat mud houses with roofs of tin
and bamboo tiles.
   Two weeks after the tribes of Hutu and Tutsi renewed a
centuries-old blood feud, killing thousands and sending tens of
thousands fleeing, sporadic killings continue and scores of
deserted homes stand like grave-markers.
   The Tutsi-dominated army, sent in to restore peace, is occupying
an area that is nearly 90 percent Hutu, the majority tribe in this
tiny East African nation.
   Soldiers with bayonets mounted on their rifles patrol the bush
or man roadblocks. Others are camped beneath trees and behind cover
that also conceals armored personnel carriers.
   Some string barbed and razor wire, while a group of 100 soldiers
clamber around a crate-laden truck to get rations of the local beer.
   An uneasy peace has been restored here, but with brutal force.
   ``When the army came it couldn't distinguish between the Tutsi
and the Hutu,'' said Stanislaus Baratakara, a Tutsi and one of the
few people who has found the courage to return home. ``To restore
order, the army killed whoever was in the place.''
   Baratakara, 52, an illiterate peasant farmer, lost two sons in
the violence. He had no notion how many other friends and neighbors
were killed by the army or in the tribal warfare that preceded the
army's arrival.
   But standing Saturday outside a fire-gutted house, where he said
a family of Tutsi had been murdered by Hutu, he said the killings
had not stopped.
   ``There are some people hiding who come at night to some
families and take one or two people,'' he said.
   A Hutu suspected of having participated in a massacre of Tutsi
was killed Saturday hours before a group of journalists reached his
commune, Baratakara said. He said he did not know the killers but
suspected they were Tutsi.
   The government has confirmed at least 5,000 deaths, a count
based on reports from gravediggers who dumped victims into mass
graves at undisclosed sites.
   But some Burundians, mostly Hutu among the 40,000 who fled into
neighboring Rwanda to escape what they say were reprisal killings
by the army, insist that they left behind tens of thousands of dead.
   Hutu refugees in Rwanda, many of them with bullet or knife
wounds, have told of soldiers herding people into houses and then
shooting them or using helicopters to firebomb villagers running
toward Rwanda.
   At the regional hospital in Kirundo, the provincial capital,
about 40 to 60 patients, most of them Tutsi, tell similar tales of
Hutu vengeance.
   The Tutsi say Hutu neighbors who opposed the killings or refused
to participate were turned on by fellow Hutu.
   Army medics and civilian nurses are treating the wounded, mostly
women and children. Normally there are three doctors at the
hospital, the only one serving the 371,000 people of this northern
province, 125 miles from the capital, Bujubura.
   The physicians, all Hutu, fled when the fighting began, said
nurse Francoise Nihorimbere.
   The Hutu account for 84 percent of Burundi's 5 million people,
but the Tutsi, about 15 percent, control the military and the
government.
   Ethnic problems in the region date from the 15th century when
the Tutsi _ a tall, Nilotic people _ migrated south from Ethiopia
and imposed feudal rule on the short, stocky Hutu.
   Burundi is one of the world's most densely populated countries,
and competition for space in the Maryland-sized nation is the cause
of much of the ethnic animosity.
   Why the latest bloodshed began is not known, although rumors and
speculation abound. Hutu refugees in Rwanda tell of arrests of Hutu
or speak of unannounced army maneuvers that prompted fears of an
impending Tutsi-led massacre. The government blames exiled Hutu for
the trouble.
   In the past, it has taken little to set off killings here. In
1972, Hutu using spears and knives killed hundreds of Tutsi in an
attempt to overthrow the government.
   The coup attempt was crushed and the Tutsi retaliated by killing
100,000 to 300,000 Hutu, including most of the tribe's
intelligentsia.
   But Burundians have lived in relative peace since Maj. Gen.
Pierre Byoya deposed fellow Tutsi Jean-Baptiste Bagaza in a
bloodless coup in December 1987.
   The new wave of killings caught the government and the Tutsi
population off-guard.
   ``On Sunday (Aug. 14), there was a meeting of those Hutu who
wanted to attack Tutsi families,'' Baratakara said. ``When they
started the massacre they burned each house of the Tutsi. They had
long knives, machetes and spears.''
   Baratakara said the attackers were his Hutu neighbors and he saw
no outsiders.
   He, his wife and four of their six children ran into the safety
of the bush after they saw two of Baratakara's sons, ages 18 and
30, hacked down.
   ``They were killed and their bodies eaten by dogs,'' Baratakara
said.
   About the same time as the trouble started in Ngeta, killing
started in Marangara, 15 miles to the south in neighboring Ngozi
province.
   Although violence broke out in several other communes, the signs
of carnage are most visible here in Ngeta.
   Rows of houses _ built with a thick, brown mud from the
hillsides _ have been gutted by fire. Windows have been smashed and
doors broken in.
   Clay cooking pots are overturned or broken in the yards outside
the houses.
   Cattle graze unattended while thin dogs scavenge for food.
   At a simple three-room house of one unidentified family, the
cool, hard-packed mud floor is littered with debris. Seeds are
scattered throughout the house.
   In one bedroom, a bed has been overturned and straw sleeping
mats trampled into bits. In another, the floor is littered with
school notebooks, childrens' clothes, a sickle-type knife and glass
from broken window panes.
   A huge cooking pot lies near the door as if it had been used in
a vain attempt to bar entry.
   Baratakara said the family living there was killed.
   Baratakara, his wife and their two youngest children returned to
their ransacked home when the army arrived, about 24 hours after
the killings started.
   The other two surviving children are among 3,500 mostly Tutsi
``refugees'' who have congregated in the commercial center of the
commune, afraid to return to their homes despite regular army
patrols.
   Hundreds of Hutu in the area are unaccounted for. Many are
feared dead, though some may be among the 40,000 refugees in Rwanda.
   Rwanda has enough trouble finding room for its 6.1 million
people, and the refugees present a major problem.
   ``We are trying to help them,'' Frederick Karangwa, governor of
the Rwandan province where the refugees have gathered, said last
week. ``But they are overwhelming us.''

   Street gang violence left at least nine dead
in Los Angeles and Riverside counties over the weekend, and Los
Angeles police hastily formed a task force to patrol a particularly
troubled area.
   Four people died in three separate shootings in the Harbor area,
one of several communities where there have been more gang deaths
this year than last year, Cmdr. William Booth of the Los Angeles
Police Department said Sunday. The Harbor district is about 25
miles south of downtown.
   ``We're going to increase patrol and go into homes of known gang
members to talk to parents,'' Booth said, adding that a meeting of
parents would be scheduled this week.
   In the latest attacks, one woman was killed and another wounded
early Sunday in the parking lot of a Harbor City housing project,
said Los Angeles police Sgt. James Allen. The dead woman's name was
withheld pending notification of relatives, Allen said.
   Several hours earlier and several blocks away, a 30-year-old man
was killed by gunman who sped away in a pickup truck, Allen said.
   A couple of miles to the east, two pedestrians _ a 16-year-old
youth and a 21-year-old man _ were killed and four others,
including an apparent innocent bystander, were wounded in a
gang-related shooting late Saturday night.
   In Southeast Los Angeles, ``a carload of gang members'' fired
about 20 shots from a semiautomatic pistol at a rival gang member,
killing an unidentified youth Saturday night, said Lt. Doug Young.
A 40-year-old man was also wounded.
   Two 26-year-old men were fatally shot early Saturday while
sitting on the balcony at a condominium complex in north Riverside,
55 miles east of Los Angeles, said police Sgt. Mike Wilson. Gang
slogans were shouted before the shooting, Wilson said.
   A 19-year-old youth was fatally shot early Saturday while
driving to visit his mother in Compton, police said. The shooting
occurred in a known gang hangout but authorities said they knew of
no motive for the crime.
   Inglewood police believed two shootings Friday night that
claimed the life of a 17-year-old and wounded two others were
committed by the same assailants, said Sgt. Ron Jackson.

   Firefighters in Yellowstone National Park focused their
attention once again on an area near Old Faithful geyser on
Saturday, and a fast-moving forest fire in Idaho killed a flock of
sheep and their accompanying sheep dogs.
   Oregon activated 100 National Guardsmen and borrowed
firefighters from Canada to help battle out-of-control blazes.
   ``We're hanging on by our fingernails,'' said Lee Oman, incident
commander at a firefighters' base camp in Valley of the Rogue State
Park near Grants Pass, Ore., where crews battled two blazes that
threatened homes in rural areas.
   Forest also burned in parts of northern California and
Washington state.
   Officials in Yellowstone appealed Saturday for private
helicopters and crews to help fight the blazes that have charred
more than 400,000 acres of the park. About 35 helicopters have been
working on the Yellowstone Complex of fires in Yellowstone and
Grand Teton parks and the adjoining Bridger-Teton, Shoshone and
Targhee national forests.
   Dave Poncin, a firefighting commander in Wyoming, said he would
like to have another 15 to 20 helicopters. Most military copters
are too big for firefighting.
   ``Military pilots are good, but they're not bush pilots. What we
need are oilfield pilots, people who fly in the mountains a lot and
are familiar with this kind of terrain,'' he said at a news
briefing. ``We're looking of course for the best in the business,
and they're probably not available. So that's where we're at.''
   A shift in wind direction in Yellowstone created a 250-acre spot
fire about five miles from Old Faithful, the park's most popular
attraction, where nearby structures earlier were threatened by
flames.
   Linda Miller, a fire information officer, said the spot fire was
created when wind fanned flames on the southern end of the
114,000-acre North Fork fire.
   Crews worked to build a containment line around the blaze by
hand and were aided by an air tanker, and the buildings around the
geyser were not threatened Saturday, morning, Miller said.
   Near Cooke City, Mont., three ranches were evacuated Saturday
because of a threat from the leading edge of the Clover Mist fire.
   Forest Service crews used bulldozers and hand crews to clear a
40-foot-wide swath for a backfire, hoping to cut off the giant fire
before it reached the ranches and U.S. Highway 212.
   ``This fire has hit us long enough now,'' said Forest Service
spokesman Pat Kaunert. ``Now, we're going to hit back. Now, it's
where we can reach it.''
   In eastern Idaho, wind pushed a forest fire over an extra 1,200
acres to a total 3,500 acres and killed an undetermined number of
sheep, Caribou National Forest spokesman Dan Pugmire said Saturday.
   ``The fire just made an end run on us yesterday afternoon,''
Pugmire said.
   The sheepherder escaped injury, but his sheep dogs also were
destroyed by the rapidly advancing Trail Creek fire, he said.
   Near Idaho's border with Oregon, the Eagle Bar fire near Hells
Canyon continued to rage out of control. It trapped 30 firefighters
Friday and forced them to spend an hour in portable shelters called
fire deflectors. They were not injured.
   Fire information officer Jeanne Felmy said the fire had burned
3,450 acres by Saturday, up about 450 acres Friday.
   In south-central Montana, just north of Yellowstone, the Storm
Creek fire grew by 2,000 acres overnight to a total 37,500 after
shifting wind pushed the flames west rather than south into the
towns of Cooke City and Silver Gate.
   About 12 miles west of Storm Creek, the Hellroaring Creek fire
grew to 33,000 acres and was ``heading very close to'' Yellowstone,
spokeswoman Stephanie Gibert said Saturday.
   In northeastern Oregon, the 7,700-acre Troy-Ward Canyon fire was
contained late Saturday without the 14 residents of Troy having to
be evacuated.
   Evacuation plans also were on hold for the 1,000 residents of a
subdivision north of Grants Pass and about a half mile from the
1,550-acre Walker Mountain fire. The fire still threatened homes
but was moving away, said Mike Barsotti, a state Forestry
Department spokesman.
   Firefighters subdued a blaze that burned more than 1,800 acres
of trees, grass and and forced the temporary evacuation of eight
families just south of Cloverdale, Calif., 65 miles north of San
Francisco.

   A TWA jet carrying 68 people made a belly landing
Saturday at O'Hare International Airport after its landing gear
failed, and at least seven people were injured while evacuating on
chutes, authorities said.
   Nobody was seriously hurt, said officials at the four nearby
hospitals where the injured were taken.
   Five of them _ including a 102-year-old Chicago woman _ were
treated and released, while two were still getting care late
Saturday, one for a twisted ankle and the other for knee pains,
officials said.
   TWA Flight 524, en route from St. Louis to Chicago, was
approaching Midway Airport shortly before 4 p.m. when the pilot
noticed landing gear problems, said Donald Morrison, a TWA
spokesman in St. Louis.
   ``The captain was unable to lower the main landing gear,''
Morrison said. ``After following normal cockpit procedures trying
to lower it manually, he proceeded to O'Hare field,'' which has
longer runways and more emergency facilities than Midway.
   Fire engines, ambulances and other emergency vehicles converged
on the runway, which was sprayed with foam to ease the landing at
4:43 p.m., in foggy, rainy conditions.
   ``It came in beautifully, it didn't skid very far at all,'' said
Patrolman Jeff Nagle, who witnessed the landing. ``It was a perfect
landing on its belly, there was no gas leak or nothing.''
   Passenger Cassandra Walker, 22, of Hazelcrest, Ill., said that
when the crew announced the landing gear was not working, some
people aboard started crying. She said the mood on board was ``very
hysterical'' after the landing with tears of relief and happiness.
   She said at one point the pilot of the Boeing 727 attempted to
relieve tension by joking about a successful ``plane landing in
Honolulu with no top, so he could do it with no bottom.''
   The TWA pilot was referring to an April incident in which an
Aloha Airlines pilot landed a plane safely after an 18-foot section
of fuselage tore away, killing one person, during a flight from
Hilo, Hawaii, to Honolulu.
   The plane Saturday was carrying 62 passengers and six
crewmembers, Morrison said.
   The cause of the landing gear problem had not been determined,
and federal aviation officials will be investigating, Morrison said.

   A tropical depression 50 miles east of Miami
drenched parts of the Bahamas Saturday, and hurricane experts
predicted the poorly organized system would turn north Sunday.
   Forecasters said East Coast residents from the middle of Florida
to North Carolina should monitor progress of the system.
   ``If it stays close to the coast it's going to be difficult for
it to become better organized than it is now,'' National Hurricane
Center forecaster Gil Clark said. ``The biggest threat is over the
eastern Bahamas, where they have these squalls.''
   The hurricane center canceled a tropical storm watch for the
Bahamas late Saturday, and rain was expected to taper off overnight.
   Early Sunday, the system was 40 miles east of Palm Beach, moving
to the northwest at 10 to 15 mph. It was expected to turn to the
north over the next 12 to 24 hours. Maximum sustained winds in the
depression were near 35 mph.
   ``It never has been organized,'' Clark said. ``It's kind of
lopsided _ all the (bad) weather's on the east side. We're not
getting anything on the west side. We don't know why. Sometimes
that happens.''
   The depression caused at least three deaths and forced hundreds
of evacuations due to swollen rivers and mudslides as it moved
across the northern edge of the Caribbean on Friday. No injuries or
flooding were reported Saturday.
   Up to 5 inches of rain was expected in the Bahamas as the
depression, the seventh of the 1988 Atlantic Ocean hurricane
season, crossed the islands.
   ``It's pretty miserable over here,'' said Roger Carron, co-owner
of The Tribune in Nassau. ``We're having a lot of rain. It's across
to Andros. In other words, the whole country seems to be
blanketed.''
   In Cuba, the official news agency La Prensa said Friday that
civil defense authorities in four eastern provinces moved thousands
of people to higher ground.
   The depression, which began forming last Sunday in the central
Atlantic, dumped 6.6 inches of rain on Puerto Rico in a 24-hour
period ending Thursday and then dropped 5 inches more on the
Dominican Republic.
   Two men and a 12-year-old boy were killed in Puerto Rico in two
separate accidents Wednesday, and more than 100 homes around the
island were damaged by flooding, Civil Defense officials in Puerto
Rico reported. They also reported mudslides and damaged highways
and bridges.
   If the lopsided depression should attain tropical-storm
strength, it would be called Chris. Two other tropical storms have
developed during the season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, but
no hurricanes.
   Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms and named when their
maximum sustained winds reach 39 mph, and become hurricanes when
maximum sustained winds hit 74 mph.

<HEAD>Coaster So Terrifying Its Designer Isn't Allowed To Ride</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN LUMSDEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AGAWAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who designed the roller coaster
that many consider the nation's most terrifying had to get
permission to work on it and has never ridden his creation. His
doctor won't let him.
   ``About the time I got started on it, I had to have open heart
surgery,'' said William L. Cobb, 70, creator of the Cyclone at
Riverside Park in Agawam. ``My doctor said it would be all right to
work on it if I didn't get too excited about anything.''
   Rated best in the nation by American Coaster Enthusiasts when it
opened five years ago, the Cyclone is still the favorite of many
coaster buffs, although it is neither the largest nor the fastest.
   What it lacks in height and speed, it makes up for in
bone-jarring turns, says Paul L. Ruben, editor of RollerCoaster!,
the official magazine of ACE, a non-profit group of 1,700 coaster
fans. He calls it the most fearsome in memory.
   ``What you're facing here is a major league throwing machine,''
said Ruben, 51, an optical engineer from Penfield, N.Y. ``With this
coaster, you win if you don't get thrown out of your seat.''
   The Cyclone's cars swoop down a 112-foot drop at a 54-degree
angle into a turn at 60 mph. The ride then takes what Ruben calls
``fiendish'' boomerang twists along 3,200 feet of track, speeding
down two more extremely steep hills and throwing riders up, down
and against the sides of their seats at least nine times.
   ``It's weird to see the ground first and then the sky,'' said
Teddy Witt, 11, of Tolland, Conn., as he waited in line for his
second ride of the day.
   Although Ruben officially rates the Cyclone No. 2 behind the
Beast at Kings Island, Ohio _ the highest, longest and fastest
coaster in the country _ he says the coaster at Agawam, outside
Springfield, has no peer in terror.
   ``Every time I was airborne the thing would change direction and
try to pull the seat out from under me,'' he said.
   During a test run with sandbags a few hours before a 1983 news
conference, it bucked a few sandbags off.
   But the coaster has been the site of only one fall, by a rider
who suffered a fractured hip in 1983; witnesses said he unfastened
his safety restraints and stood up. A few months later, one of the
trains failed to stop and ran into the back of another, injuring
seven people.
   Park officials say there have been no injuries since, however.
   ``Ride safety is almost a religion among park operators,'' Ruben
said.
   Maintenance crews walk the coaster's rails every morning to
clear and check them and test-run the cars every day with sandbags.
Its operators say they argue several times daily with riders who
want to take along children too short to be held back by the safety
bar; there is a strictly enforced rider height minimum of 54 inches.
   ``People, kids too, they threaten us and they try to bribe us,''
said operator Don Shunney, 19.
   Cobb said the Cyclone was among the hardest coasters he has
designed in the last 20 years because of its tight space, a tight
construction deadline and the park's orders to create a ride that
would scare the daylights out of riders.
   ``They wanted people to think while they were riding it: `My
gosh, I'll never get off this thing alive,''' he said.
   Since the Cyclone, Cobb also designed Le Monstre in Montreal,
with two tracks that race against each other and with a 100-foot
twisting drop toward the St. Lawrence River.
   Cobb isn't all that upset that doctors won't let him ride his
creations.
   ``I never was a good rider,'' he admits. ``I was too critical.
If it didn't do exactly what I thought it should do, I would be
disappointed.''

   Honorary mayoral candidates in this
North San Diego County community have to be able to throw the mud
to make it to the top.
   With squishy, slimy mud pies in hand, three candidates for the
non-office battled it out Saturday to see who could fling the mud
the farthest.
   ``Compared to the Bush-Dukakis presidential campaign, this
mud-slinging contest ... was neat and clean,'' said Al Diederich,
manager of the local Chamber of Commerce which sponsored the second
annual mud-hurling fete.
   The high noon confrontation matched would-be-mayors Patti Seim,
Carol Morgan and Alfred Canchola in a 10-shot event.
   After the candidates' 30 flings were tabulated, Canchola, a
carpenter, was declared the winner.
   ``We don't have an official mayor because we're not a city,''
Diederich said of the town in unincorporated county territory, 50
miles north of San Diego.
   So the Chamber of Commerce has turned the honorary race into a
fund-raising event. Between Aug. 1 and Sept. 9, the official
campaign period, candidates offer votes for sale for $1, with
proceeds going to the chamber, he said.
   The candidate who pulls in the most votes becomes honorary mayor
for a year. The losers in Saturday's competition had to forfeit $25
in votes to the victor. The winner will be announced Sept. 21,
Diederich said.

   The greased zucchini toss and the green baton
relay race highlighted the Zucchini Olympics at the seventh and
final International Zucchini Festival.
   Final? Dixie Gurrian, a spokeswoman for the Zucchini Central
Committee, explained organizers spent nine months planning the
festival. ``We're all pooped,'' she said.
   Saturday's event, she said, raised between $14,000 and $15,000
for the Harrisville Children's Center and the Grand Monadnock Arts
Council. More than 1,000 people showed up at Keene State College
for the fun.
   Some zuke fans were squashed by the decision not to hold the
festival next year. Some even passed around petitions protesting
the committee's decision.
   ``I have six pages of names of people willing to volunteer'' if
there's a festival next year, she said. Still, there are no plans
to reincarnate the event, she added.
   Asked about future fund-raisers, Gurrian said, ``You never know
what we'll come up with over the winter.''

   A 4.258-pound tomato that won a statewide
competition and a $1,000 prize for Minnie Zaccaria of Long Branch
would have been bigger if this summer's heat hadn't ripened it so
fast, she said.
   ``I knew it was going to be big. You kind of tell when it's on
the vine what it will weigh,'' Ms. Zaccaria said Saturday.
   Ms. Zaccaria, who won the 1986 championship, said this summer's
hot weather forced her to pick the tomato weeks before the contest
and keep it in her refrigerator.
   ``I really felt it would have been a lot bigger. The heat forced
all the fruit to ripen sooner than it would have,'' she said.
   There's no trick to growing large tomatoes, she said. ``Anybody
can do it with the proper soil, water and food. It takes those
three things in the right proportions.''
   Ms. Zaccaria said she set out 75 tomato plants this summer, but
doesn't plan to grow that many tomatoes next year because of the
work involved.
   Two other Long Branch residents, Daniel E. Parottino and his
wife, Sylvia, grew the second- and third-place winners in the 11th
annual New Jersey Championship Tomato Weigh-In. Parottino's
3.896-pound tomato earned him $500, while Mrs. Parottino's weighed
3.838 pounds worth $250.
   Thirty-seven winners of local tomato weigh-ins converged on the
Monmouth Mall in Eatontown for Saturday's championship. The contest
is sponsored by Joseph Heimbold of Monmouth Beach, who originated
the idea, and gardening supply stores throughout the state.

   Nearly two months after a judge refused to
stop a 27-year-old mother of three from having an abortion which
her husband vehemently opposed, Christine and Timothy Anderson are
back together.
   Although they haven't budged from their positions _ she supports
abortion rights and he's anti-abortion _ they say their 3-year-old
marriage now is better than ever.
   ``I respect his beliefs and he respects mine,'' Mrs. Anderson
said.
   When she learned she was pregnant a fourth time, she said, their
marriage was troubled and they had a mountain of debts.
   ``I kept looking at my kids,'' she said. ``I felt I had to have
an abortion so I could better provide for them.''
   In addition, they had agreed not to have more children. The
birth of their third child last year was difficult so Anderson
underwent a vasectomy, but it failed and she became pregnant three
months later.
   Anderson sued and obtained a temporary court order barring his
wife from having an abortion.
   Anderson's attorney, Rodney Brodin, argued that a man's right to
have a family should be balanced with a woman's right to have an
abortion.
   But on the morning of July 8, Mrs. Anderson waited at the
Women's Health Center in Duluth for the judge's decision on whether
to extend his order until the case could go to trial.
   ``I was scared either way,'' she said. ``I was scared to go
through with the abortion procedure and scared that I wouldn't be
able to legally go through with it.''
   When word arrived that the judge had not extended the order, the
abortion was performed before her husband could file an appeal. She
was two months pregnant.
   ``It's hard enough to have an abortion,'' she said. ``It's even
harder to go through with it when the world knows about it and you
have to go out on the street afterwards.''
   At times, Anderson, 34, has doubted whether he did the right
thing.
   ``I did what I thought was the right thing to do,'' he said. ``I
oppose abortion because of my religious beliefs and because I have
always thought abortion was bad.''
   After all the public attention, he said he and his wife want to
put the episode behind them.
   ``I wish it had never happened,'' he said. ``I want to forget
about the whole thing and put it in the past.''

<HEAD>Novelist Costas Taktsis Found Strangled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Costas Taktsis, whose novel ``The
Third Wedding Wreath'' won international acclaim after he published
it himself, was found strangled in his home, police said Sunday. He
was 61.
   Taktsis apparently had been dead for at least 48 hours when his
naked body was found Saturday evening, a police spokesman said. The
house in the seedy Kolonos district of Athens had been ransacked
and a video recorder was missing, said the spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Taktsis, born in the northern city of Salonica, studied law
before becoming a full-time writer and translator. He wrote ``The
Third Wedding Wreath'' in 1962 and had it published at his own
expense.
   The book, which was written in the first person, tells the story
of Nitsa, an Athenian woman who survived World War II and the Greek
civil war through her resilience and caustic sense of humor.
   Ignored by Greek critics, the book sold few copies until it was
translated into English in 1968. It then won enthusiastic reviews
that praised Taktsis' humorous insight and lively picture of
middle-class Athenian life.
   Taktis also was known for his translations of ancient Greek
plays into modern Greek, often for experimental performances by
Athenian theater groups.
   His most recent book was ``Grandmother Athina,'' a collection of
essays and short stories about the Greek capital inspired by
memories of his grandmother.

<HEAD>Opposition Leaders Map Post-Zia Strategy, British Press Reports
Sabotage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IQBAL JAFFERY</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Left-wing opposition leaders began
mapping new strategies Sunday for sharing political power after the
death of President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   Leading British newspapers, meanwhile, reported that Pakistan
concluded sabotage was to blame for the Aug. 17 plane crash that
killed Zia, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan and many of the
country's top generals.
   The Sunday Times of London said Pakistani officials believe Zia
was killed by an international conspiracy involving Pakistani
activists in Britain. It said the government wants to question five
Pakistani nationals in Britain. The newspaper gave no attribution.
   The Sunday Telegraph quoted unidentified sources in Washington
as saying the Pakistani investigation concluded the plane was shot
down by a missile. The newspaper did not say what kind of missile
was involved or who fired it.
   The Observer newspaper said Pakistani officials were convinced
India's intelligence service was to blame. It quoted unidentified
high-level Pakistani sources.
   The Pakistani government has not made any official statements on
the cause of the crash, although individual officials have said
they believe it was sabotage. U.S. and British diplomats in
Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, have said they are not aware of
any initial conclusions in the Pakistani inquiry.
   In Pakistan, the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy, a
nine-party opposition alliance, planned to meet Sunday and Monday
in the southern city of Karachi to plot strategy.
   On Saturday in the western city of Quetta, an estimated 20,000
opposition supporters waved banners and chanted anti-Zia slogans as
speakers called for a neutral caretaker government to guide the
nation to a return to civilian rule in general elections scheduled
for Nov. 16.
   Several of Zia's civilian backers have been appointed to a
caretaker Cabinet.
   As chief of the army, Zia shared power with a civilian
government for only three of his eleven years in power. But his
replacement as army chief, Gen. Aslam Beg, said last week the
military's role would be to ensure an orderly transition to
democracy.
   Leaders at the rally praised Beg's intentions but called on
Acting President Ghulam Ishaq Khan to replace the caretaker
government with ``neutral people'' until the November polls.
   ``If Ishaq Khan wants peace and harmony in the country and
cooperation of the political leaders, he should immediately do away
with the present ministers,'' said Abdul Wali Khan, leader of the
Socialist Awami National Party.
   ``Unless this is done, no politicans will extend any
continuation of Zia's dictatorship, a rule of tyranny and
oppression which lasted 11 years,'' Wali Khan said.
   He called on Ishaq Khan to come out squarely for party-based
elections instead of non-party polls ordered by Zia before his
death.
   Ishaq Khan, a former Senate chairman, told reporters at his
first news conference he would follow the Constitution, which
reconizes a party-based parliamentary system.
   But he said he would let the Supreme Court rule on opposition
petitions to open the November elections to all comers.
   Opposition alliance leaders said they expected to win seats in a
new national assembly, but there are no reliable figures in
Pakistan on party memberships.
   The alliance's largest member, Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan
People's Party, is considered the nation's largest party. But the
party and its alliance partners boycotted the only elections held
under Zia's rule, in 1985, because candidates were allowed to run
only as individuals.
   The Sunday Times said that because Pakistan has no extradition
treaty with Britain, it was approaching the British Embassy in
Islamabad with a request that five Pakistanis suspected of a role
in the plane crash be sent back ``as a special favor.''
   The newspaper said at least three previous attempts to
assassinate Zia involved Pakistanis in Britain. It identified six
Pakistanis who it said were either involved in the attempts or
wanted Zia dead.
   The newspaper said it spoke to five of them. Four denied
involvement in Zia's death while the fifth, who admitted being
involved in previous attempts, said he could not comment, the paper
said.
   Three of the five said they would have killed the president
willingly, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Study Says Technology May Stall Government, Tax Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associoated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The growth of government power to tax and
regulate ``may be in its twilight years'' as modern technology
makes it easier for businesses to move from place to place,
according to a private study.
   Richard B. McKenzie, an economics professor at Clemson
University in South Carolina, said computers, facsimile machines,
satellites and other technologies have enabled businesses to
respond to government intrusion by going elsewhere.
   McKenzie conducted his study for the Washington-based Cato
Institute, a policy analysis and research organization which
generally follows a libertarian philosophy of encouraging the least
possible government intervention in human affairs.
   ``Capital is being freed from the strict confines of arbitrary
national boundaries,'' he wrote. ``As a consequence, the power of
government to tax and regulate may be in its twilight years.''
   The study said that in the past, manufacturers historically
concentrated their operations in fixed industrial centers. The
costs of relocating factories was high, so governments could impose
taxes and regulations without worrying about capital flight.
   As a result, governments grew steadily larger and more complex,
he said.
   All that has changed as electronic technology tied the world
more closely together economically and geographic boundaries were
erased, McKenzie said.
   The computer that once filled a room can now sit on someone's
lap. The textile loom once the size of a car is no larger than a
birdbath. Company records have been transferred from large file
cabinets onto tiny electronic chips.
   McKenzie said the difficulty and cost of long-distance
communications in the past forced businesses to stay close to one
another.
   Today, it is cheap and easy for a business executive to call up
on a computer screen the competitive bids for a job that can be
performed as easily in St. Louis as in Camden, S.C., or
Trincomalee, Sri Lanka.
   McKenzie said managers can effortlessly shift plans and designs
from place to place and transfer financial capital from one country
to another at the press of a computer button.
   ``In doing do, modern managers can escape the reckless authority
of government to regulate and control,'' he wrote. ``And in doing
so, they force legislators to think carefully about the economic as
well as the political constraints on their governing roles.''
   McKenzie said that while government is not getting smaller in
absolute terms, there is evidence of a slowdown in growth of
government. He said U.S. government spending has grown more slowly
than the gross national product in recent years.
   Similar trends are occurring in Japan, West Germany, Britain and
China, he said.
   Government competition to stabilize or lower tax rates extends
beyond these industrial giants to many smaller countries, including
Singapore, South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, Turkey,
Jamaica, Colombia, Bolivia, Mexico, Grenada, Botswana, Ciskei,
Mauritius, India and Israel.
   McKenzie said governments can be expected to react to their
diminishing power with rhetorical ``bashing'' of competitors like
Japan and South Korea and efforts to conceal the costs of new
programs by such tactics as shifting to businesses the
responsibility for such programs as child care and health insurance.
   Nonetheless, McKenzie concludes that ``the world will likely be
beset with an enormous power of government to tax and regulate for
as long as can be imagined.''

   Two Italian air force jets
collided during an air show at a U.S. military base Sunday before
plunging to the ground and injuring up to 100 spectators, an
official and news reports said.
   A U.S. Air Force colonel at Ramstein Air Base told The
Associated Press that ``anywhere from 20 to 100'' people were hurt
among several hundred people who turned out to watch the
demonstration.
   Hesse State radio in Frankfurt also said up to 100 spectators
were injured, including about 15 who received ``serious burns.''
   ``We have to assume there will be some deaths,'' said Bernd
Nagel, a spokesman for Rhineland Palatinate state, where the
Ramstein base is located.
   The planes collided in the air, then crashed into the crowd of
spectators at the Ramstein base in southwestern Germany, the
colonel said. He said there was an unconfirmed report that a third
airplane was involved in the crash.
   Nagel said eyewitnesses reported that one of the planes plowed
directly into the crowd of spectators. Police in nearby
Kaiserlautern said the two falling jets and debris from them
``crashed into the crowd.''
   The colonel, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the two
planes belonged to a 10-airplane Italian air force demonstration
team. Other officials said the planes belonged to the ``Frecce
Tricolori'' flying team.

   A private auto safety group, using tread wear
data the Transportation Department doesn't publicize, said Sunday
that a 15-inch General radial tire was the longest lasting in
government mileage tests.
   Topping a list prepared by the Center for Auto Safety was the
General 15-inch Ameri Classic, with a tread wear rating of 350 _
meaning it should get 70,000 miles of use under average driving
conditions.
   The worst mileage performers among the 111 radial tire models
tested were the General XP 2000Z G, the Goodrich T@A R and R1 and
Yokohama's 60 and 70 A001R@A008R. All had ratings of 50 _ or 10,000
miles of use.
   As it released its own list, the center renewed its demand for
the department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to
publish a buying guide publicizing tire wear ratings for the
benefit of consumers.
   The draft of such a guide, similar to the Environmental
Protection Agency's annual gasoline mileage ratings for new car
models, was prepared under the Carter administration but was never
published.
   When President Reagan took office in 1981, the department and
the tire industry tried to abolish the tread wear grading program
but were thwarted in 1984 by the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   ``They did reinstate the program, but all they have done is
comply with the minimum requirements of the law,'' said Clarence
Ditlow, safety director of the non-profit center.
   ``The difference is that EPA publicizes its results so that
consumers know what their tax dollars are paying for, and the
Transportation Department hides its results.''
   Jeff Miller, NHSTA's deputy administrator, said his agency has
no obligation to publish what he called consumer information.
   ``To call it a tempest in a teapot would overstate the matter,''
Miller said. ``We do everything the law requires and then some.
   ``We have a very good brochure telling consumers what they
should look for in tires,'' Miller said. ``What this group wants
isn't safety information but more consumer information ... more
heavy-handed federal regulation.''
   Donald G. Brotzman, chairman of the Tire Industry Safety
Council, which has opposed publication of the tread wear ratings,
said the federal Uniform Tire Quality Grading System was never
intended to provide consumers a ``play the numbers'' guide.
   ``The tread wear grade is not a guarantee that a tire will last
a prescribed number of miles,'' Brotzman said. ``It is a
comparative rating of a tire's wear rate when tested under
controlled conditions on a specified government test course.''
   He said the safety center's report overlooks the significance of
a tire's traction and temperature resistance ratings. The center
listed neither data.
   The center said the mileage data showed all 17 tire companies
involved in the tests had good and bad performers.
   For example, it said, the Goodyear Double Eagle had a 260 rating
_ 52,000 miles of wear _ while the Goodyear Eagle GT S had only a
100 rating, or 20,000 miles.
   With that information, Ditlow said, consumers could compare
tread wear ratings with tire prices and figure out how much each
costs per mile of use.
   Using manufacturer-recommended retail prices, the center
calculated that Goodyear's 13-inch Tiempo, priced at $47.95 and
with a tread wear rating of 170, costs $1.65 per 1,000 miles.
   Michelin's XA4 model, at $47.90 but with a tread wear rating of
310, costs 80 cents per 1,000 miles, the center said.
   The government requires tire makers to mold into sidewalls the
tread wear ratings along with letter grades A, B or C on the
traction and temperature resistance of each tire model.
   A tire graded A on traction will stop on a wet road in the
shortest distance, while one graded C will have the poorest
traction. For temperature resistance, a grade of A means the tire
will run cooler than one graded B or C and is less likely to blow
out or show tread separation.

<TEXT>
   The campaign of Michael Dukakis, concerned by
George Bush's surge in the polls, is under increasing pressure to
take a more aggressive stance in the presidential contest and the
candidate himself is suggesting he might do just that.
   Democratic strategists in and out of the Dukakis campaign
expressed growing concern last week that Bush had seized control of
the debate and that Dukakis' message was either too vague or being
obscured by Bush's forceful attacks on Dukakis and the media focus
on the vice president's coice of Indian Sen. Dan Quayle as his
running mate.
   While Dukakis frequently denounces negative campaigning, he
hinted strongly Saturday that he was nearing the point where he
would return Bush's salvos, which range from attacks on Dukakis'
patriotism and record on crime issues to jokes about his height.
   ``Remember 1982? It's Ed King all over again,'' Dukakis said
Saturday night on a flight from Washington to western Massachusetts
where he was spending the weekend before a two-day gubernatorial
visit to the region.
   King was the man who knocked Dukakis out of office in 1978 only
to lose four years later in a rematch that was considered one of
the nastiest and most aggressive campaigns in state history.
   ``It's getting the juices out early,'' Dukakis said. ``In 1982,
King was on with negative television on me beginning in February. I
mean non-stop, never got off, every single week, bang, bang, bang
bang.
   ``Did it hurt? Sure it hurt. But at the appropriate point,
people I think had a sense that enough is enough. You come back,
and basically you make the needed adjustments.''
   Just what those adjustments will be this year remains unclear,
but there has been, according to campaing aides, virtually daily
debate over whether Dukakis should adopt a more agressive posture.
   The aides, speaking privately, say Dukakis has resisted most
attempts to get him to respond faster and feistier to the Bush
criticisms. Instead, he has continued to stress his message of
economic opportunity and will continue that effort this week with
two economic speeches during his state trip.
   With the exception of an economic speech he delivered after
winning the AFL-CIO endorsement last week and a sharply worded
attack on Reagan-Bush anti-drug efforts the following day, Dukakis'
message has been largely lost during the focus on the Republican
National Convention, the Quayle selection and the Bush-Quayle
attacks on Dukakis' positions on defense, crime, the Pledge Of
Allegiance and gun control.
   ``The other stories have tended to obscure the message that
we've tried to get out,'' said Dukakis issues adviser Thomas
Herman. ``We'll keep talking about our message and we think it will
begin to stick once some of the clutter and stage or negative
campaigning ends.''
   Dukakis, speaking to reporters on the flight, recalled that John
F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson got bogged down with congressional
duties after the 1960 Democratic convention but bounced back to
win, seemingly a reference to the time he is forced to dedicate to
being governor.
   But, with Bush surging and Labor Day on the horizon, Dukakis
plans to cut his statehouse time to one day a week and, in another
effort to reinvigorate his effort, his campaign is preparing to
unleash a round of television advertising.
   ``After Labor Day you'll seen the real fight,'' said Dukakis
strategist Chuck Campion.
   Dukakis and aides also blame talk that their campaign is
floundering on the media, which reports that Bush is mounting an
aggressive campaign and translates that into a stalled Dukakis
effort.
   ``Long campaigns tend to be like this,'' said Dukakis consultant
Thomas Kiley. ``You move in and out of phases where one candidate
is being more specific and more engaged.''
   In the Dukakis campaign, ``engaged'' is the word for aggressive,
a term the governor's aides are quick to differentiate from
``nasty,'' a label they have pinned on Bush.
   ``We'll be running against Mr. Bush's record,'' said Herman.
``In the areas where Mr. Bush has a record, like drugs and trade,
he has failed.''
   In seizing the debate, Bush has focused on a Dukakis program
that until early this year allowed first-degree murderers out on
furlough and the governor's 1977 veto of legislation that would
have required Massachusetts teachers to lead students in the Pledge
of Allegiance. Dukakis veteod it after being advised it was
unconstitutional. Bush has said he would sign the measure, leading
Dukakis to say Bush is unfit for the presidency is he would sign
unconstitutional legislation.
   ``This contest is not about which one of us is the most
patriotic,'' Dukakis said Saturday. ``We're both good patriots. We
both love our country.''
   With statements like that, Dukakis hopes to show he is trying to
keep the high ground and will credit Bush if he thinks credit is
due. But Dukakis also has a history of firing back when he believes
he has come under undue attack.
   In 1982, for example, Dukakis was under harsh attack from King
in the weeks leading up to a televised debate. Before the program
began, Dukakis was asked to check his microphone and rattled off
figures about increasing crime during the King administration. The
move startled King and he floundered through the debate as Dukakis
assailed him for running a corrupt administration. Dukakis, under
attack from Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt during the presidential
primaries, also aired an ad noting Gephardt's ``flip flops'' on a
number of issues
   Dukakis and his aides also have raised questions about Bush's
judgment, choosing not to directly attack Quayle, instead
questioning whether the 41-year-old senator with an undistinguished
congressional record is qualified, as Dukakis said Saturday, ``to
step in as president the next day if needed.''
   Senior Dukakis adviser Kirk O'Donnell promised those efforts
would continue and that Dukakis would make new proposals after
Labor Day.
   The candidate himself, predicting he would rebound soon, smiled
and simply said, ``It's only August.''

<HEAD>Iraq Claims Cease-Fire Violations by Iran
^With AM-Gulf Talks, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>

   Iraq said Sunday that Iranian troops fired
shots and set up new radar and observation posts last week in
violation of a 9-day-old truce in the Persian Gulf war.
   Iran accused Iraq of undermining the peace talks in Geneva by
claiming sovereignty over the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway and
said the talks may drag on for years.
   The commander of the U.N. observer forces monitoring the truce
said the cease-fire was holding but that more time was needed to
finish plotting the exact location of the front line.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said more than a dozen Iranian
violations were reported to the U.N. peacekeepers between Tuesday
and Friday. Neither Iran nor the observer force commented on the
claims.
   In the northern region of Kurdistan, the Iranians set up two
radar positions manned by three Iranian officers, not far from
Iraqi troops, the agency said. It said ``appropriate measures were
taken to eliminate the two positions and push the enemy back'' but
did not elaborate.
   At the southern end of the front, Iranian soldiers fired shots
but U.N. observers intervened to ``stop the Iranian violations and
returned two advancing Iranians to their positions,'' the agency
said.
   In other parts of the front the Iranians set up barricades,
fired a machine gun, flew helicopters near Iraqi positions, and set
up other radar and observation posts, the agency said.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Javad Mansouri as saying
Iraq ``continues to have designs on Iran's territorial integrity.''
   IRNA quoted Mansouri as saying the Iraqi delegation in Geneva
``is underming the talks by bringing up irrelevant and
objectionable topics, such as Iraq's claim of sovereignty of the
Arvand river,'' Iran's name for the Shatt-al-Arab.
   He stressed that Tehran considers the 1975 Algiers Treaty, which
defined the border between the two countries, as valid. The treaty
granted Iran control of the eastern half of the waterway, which is
Iraq's only outlet to the sea.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who considered the treaty a
humiliation for Baghdad, tore up the accord during a televised
speech in September 1980.
   Mansouri said the negotiations in Geneva were going so slowly
that they might ``drag on for years to come.''
   In Baghdad, the head of the peacekeeping force, Maj. Gen. Slavko
Jovic of Yugoslavia, told a news conference that ``the cease-fire
is operational. The situation along the border is generally calm.
   ``Some minor problems and questions we are resolving through
negotiations, and enjoying very good help through the understanding
of both parties,'' Jovic said.
   He refused to say what the minor problems were, but indicated
there had been no confirmed major violations of the cease-fire that
took hold Aug. 20.
   Jovic said an Iraqi report last week that an Iranian sniper
killed an Iraqi soldier was ``unconfirmed,'' but was being
investigated.
   He said the roughly 300 U.N. observers on the ground were in the
process of determining the positions held by both sides when
fighting halted in the nearly 8-year-old war.
   Under a plan of action set out by U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, withdrawal to the pre-war border is due at a
later stage.
   Defining the border is a key factor in the current peace talks
between Iranian and Iraqi leaders.
   Jovic confirmed the death of a Danish major, identified by other
sources as Steen Preben-Andersen. U.N. officials said the major
apparently suffered a heat stroke along the sweltering central
front Aug. 23 at about 2 p.m. and was quickly hospitalized by the
Iraqis.
   The Iraqi agency, INA, said Preben-Andersen's body was taken to
Baghdad airport on Sunday on its way back to Denmark.

<TEXT>
   Folks who live in Michael Dukakis'
favorite summer spot are divided over how well their isolated
hamlet in a valley of the Berkshire Hills would bear up if it
becomes a presidential retreat.
   ``I'm too old and our little town is too peaceful for this,''
said Carolyn Canon, 77, a Republican resident of the town the
Democratic presidential nominee and state governor has declared his
preferred place for respites from politics.
   Tyringham has no school. Christmas lights still adorn the fire
station. The Appalachian Trail cuts through the center of the
hamlet with barely a notice.
   Dukakis' hideaway is a modest one-story white ranch, with a
small guest cottage and backyard pool, on the edge of the hamlet
that has about as many year-around residents as there are days in
the year. It belongs to his father-in-law, Harry Ellis Dickson,
associate conductor of the Boston Pops.
   ``I don't really think we have anything to worry about,'' said
Betty Jean Cernik, the town tax collector for 27 years. ``It's a
long way from Tyringham to the White House. But the majority of
people in town dread the thought of him being here and the tourists
and Secret Service and all.''
   Tacked on the wall next to the postal boxes in a corner of the
town library _ beneath a ``Thank You'' note to townsfolk from a
recent widow _ was a local newspaper story about Tyringham's
possibilities as a presidential retreat. The clipping enlivened the
morning for some of librarian Irma Clark's postal customers.
   ``Oh, my God,'' said one elderly women, whose family has lived
in the valley for six generations. ``Tyringham will be on the map
and it's starting already. Don't you dare put my name in the
paper.''
   ``All I can say is here goes another voter for (Republican
contender George) Bush,'' said a young mother rushing out the door
with her mail, who also declined to give her name.
   ``I just can't understand the reaction,'' said Mary Hale, who as
chairman of the board of selectmen also serves as chief of
Tyringham's four-member part-time police force. ``People are just
being ridiculous.
   ``He's been coming here for years and it never bothered them
before. I run meetings with him every month in Boston and he always
asks about the town and says how much he wished he was there,''
said Ms. Hale, who is also president of the Massachusetts Municipal
Association.
   ``He is a dear person, a lovely person and an asset to the
village,'' she said. ``I'm sure no one even noticed the other
presidents who stayed here.''
   The 249-year-old town is no stranger to the rich and famous.
Presidents Grover Cleveland and William Taft were summer residents
and Mark Twain gave the library a complete set of his books after
spending the summer of 1903 here. Nat King Cole's widow is a
longtime resident, as are a few soap opera stars, television
producers and writers.
   Dukakis is a familiar sight jogging on back roads and riding
around in a beat-up Dodge, said dairy farmer Charles Slater, 71.
   ``He comes here for privacy and I let him have it. There's no
fanfare with the guy. People respect privacy here and don't make no
big fuss,'' said Slater, whose Crystal Brooks farm has been in his
family for eight generations.
   ``I just hope it's not like it was with the queen,'' said his
wife, Elizabeth, recalling the impact Queen Wilhelmina of the
Netherlands had on the neighboring town of Lee when she and her
family fled there to escape the Nazis during World War II.
   ``The town was overrun by the FBI and the other men President
Roosevelt sent to guard her,'' Mrs. Slater said. ``You couldn't
even get into the stores to shop.''

   The long-smouldering nuclear arms race in
South Asia is being restrained by strategic and political factors,
opening the way for limited non-proliferation arrangements
involving India, Pakistan and possibly China, according to a Senate
study published Sunday.
   The report by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff
concludes that despite their advanced atomic energy programs,
neither India nor Pakistan has chosen to undertake an overt nuclear
weapons project.
   The study says India, which detonated a nuclear explosive device
in 1974, leads Pakistan in nuclear expertise, command of nuclear
weapons technology and access to fissionable material.
   The report concludes that India could produce a dozen to 18
nuclear weapons a year and that Pakistan is capable of
manufacturing only one to three such weapons annually.
   Prepared by Peter W. Galbraith, a South Asia expert on the
committee staff, the report says both Pakistan and India see
strategic disadvantages in the general spread of nuclear weapons in
South Asia.
   It says this ``provides an incentive for each to take steps to
keep the region free of nuclear weapons.''
   ``For Pakistan, a subcontinental arms race is a race it's sure
to lose,'' the report said. ``Pakistan cannot match India's nuclear
production capabilities and would face annihilation by India in a
hypothetical nuclear exchange between the two.''
   For its part, India has little to fear from a conventionally
armed Pakistan but that ``a nuclear-armed Pakistan could inflict
major damage,'' the study said.
   It noted that prominent Pakistani politicians have adopted
positions against nuclear weapons. The report said there is no
indication that the Aug. 17 plane explosion that killed President
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq will produce any change in Pakistan's nuclear
policies.
   U.S. relations with Pakistan and India often have been strained
over nuclear issues, although Washington's concern over nuclear
proliferation at times has been overshadowed by attention to other
regional problems.
   ``The successful implementation of the Geneva accords for a
Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan may again make non-proliferation
the top U.S. priority in the region,'' the report said.
   India's concern about China's nuclear arsenal must be taken into
account in any comprehensive arrangement to keep South Asia free of
nuclear weapons, the study said.
   ``A nuclear weapons free zone that included parts of China and
the Indian Ocean as well as South Asia might be achievable,'' it
said.
   The report says both India and Pakistan have ample means to
deliver nuclear warheads to their targets, and that India has the
advantage over its neighbor.
   The study notes that India recently successfully test-fired a
short-range surface-to-surface missile called the Prithvi which may
be capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.

<HEAD>Patroling Against Aliens Yields Drug Seizures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several months ago, two Border Patrol agents
were lying in ambush on the muddy banks of the Rio Grande River
when they saw two men wading through the water from Mexico.
   The agents called on them to stop, the two pulled out weapons, a
gunbattle ensued and one of the aliens was killed. The other fled,
dropping 40 pounds of marijuana.
   The incident, recounted by Texas Border Patrol agent George
Gunnoe, underlines the closely intertwined tasks of interdicting
drugs and illegal aliens.
   ``Smuggling aliens and drugs go hand-in-hand,'' said Hugh J.
Brien, chief of the Border Patrol, which is the paramilitary
enforcement arm of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Last year, the agency intercepted more than 60 percent of the
drugs caught along the southwestern border: 209,281 pounds of
marijuana, 12,813 pounds of cocaine and some 50 lbs. of heroin,
according to figures supplied by the INS. The rest of the drugs was
apprehended mostly by the Customs Service, according to Customs
figures.
   The Border Patrol also stopped some 1 million illegal aliens,
down from the 1985 high of 1.8 million.
   But Brien pointed out that only about 7,000 of those intercepted
along the border were caught with drugs _ and some were American
smugglers. ``Most of these aliens are decent people trying to
better themselves,'' Brien said.
   Ironically, the patrol is the only government unit taking part
in an interagency anti-drug effort without earmarked funding. The
INS is working to change that and hopes to get some $60 million if
Congress passes a drug enforcement bill later this year.
   Counting on those funds to augment its $210 million budget, the
Border Patrol has begun a drive to recruit 1,000 additional agents
to patrol the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border against aliens and
drugs.
   Of the agency's 3,600 agents, 2,900 are on that border and the
rest on the Canadian front.
   ``We're ideal for this job. We're on the border, we know the
terrain, our agents are the best trackers around and they all speak
Spanish,'' said Brien, a naturalized American of Irish origin.
   Since 1986, when the patrol was included in an interagency
campaign to interdict drugs, the number of its narcotics seizures
has more than doubled to 2,751 in 1987. From last October through
April, the patrol intercepted 2,236 drug shipments from Mexico.
   Brien, as well as officials from other drug agencies, believes
the increased seizures are due partly to increased trafficking by
smugglers pushed inland by the air and naval cordon that the Coast
Guard has imposed along the Gulf of Mexico.
   The U.S-Mexico border still accounts for about one-third of the
cocaine entering the United States and 40 percent of the marijuana,
according to the Drug Enforcement Agency.
   Much of the cocaine is flown from Colombia to Mexico, where it
is hidden in safehouses along the border until smugglers pick it
up, said Gunnoe. The traffickers often use illegal aliens as
couriers in return for getting them across the border, he added.
   One of the methods used by the smugglers, especially in the
Arizona area, is mule trains. Typically, Brien said, a train will
consist of nine or 10 mules, each carrying 200-300 pounds of drugs,
accompanied by four to six outriders armed with Soviet-made AKA-47
automatic rifles.
   As a result, the Border Patrol has issued its agents M-16 rifles.
   The agents patrol on foot, horseback, light aircraft and
all-terrain vehicles. They also use sensors and low-light
television cameras to monitor the border, Brien said.
   ``We don't have Star Wars technology'' like the Coast Guard's
balloon-mounted radars, Brien said, but the Border Patrol has 25
assets the other agencies don't: Belgian Malinois dogs especially
trained to sniff out drugs and people.
   The Malinois, a docile version of the German Shepherd, have been
sitting down on the job since April 1987 _ which is what they're
supposed to do when they detect drugs or aliens hidden in trucks
and trains.
   The dogs have detected 244 drug shipments, some of them buried
under loads of onions or rocks, Brien said.
   He said one informant told the Border Patrol that a Colombian
drug cartel had put out a $30,000 contract on Rocky, the
three-year-old canine with the biggest number of drug seizures
under his collar.

<HEAD>Students Form Illegal Union, Thousands of Prisoners Released</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEIN WIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Activist students, emboldened by massive
student-led demonstrations that toppled a president, moved Sunday
toward a more public stance by forming a union in defiance of the
law.
   Authorities released 4,806 prisoners from the Insein Jail north
of the capital two days after a riot and mass escape left at least
57 people dead and 106 injured, state-run Rangoon radio said.
   Large breakouts were reported last week at three other prisons
in Burma.
   The radio said those released Sunday from Insein, which holds
about 10,000 prisoners, included people whose trials were
continuing or who had less than a year's time to serve.
   Local residents gave some of the freed prisoners clothes, small
packets of rice and bus fare home, the radio said. Other prisoners
walked into Rangoon and asked people on the street for money to
return home.
   On Saturday, authorities freed 655 prisoners from Insein for
good conduct or because they were nearing the end of their
sentences.
   About 50,000 students gathered at Rangoon University and learned
of the formation of the All-Burma Students Union and a temporary
14-member executive committee chaired by student leader Min Ko
Naing.
   ``Our fight for democracy is not yet over. ... We want
democracy, right of association and we will continue to resist any
government that will deprive us of these rights,'' Min Ko Naing
told the crowd.
   Burma's students entered national politics in the early 1920s
and were active against British colonial rule.
   Shortly after former leader Ne Win seized power in 1962 he
crushed a student rebellion at Rangoon University, ordered the
student union building destroyed and banned student unions.
   Underground student unions began to operate about three years
ago and masked students were in the vanguard of anti-government
demonstrations in March, June and July.
   Sunday's events appeared to indicate the students were moving
more into the open. But the identities of the executive committee
members were not revealed, and little was known about the union
leader although his name has been on anti-government pamphlets in
recent weeks.
   Min Ko Naing told the crowd of students that after democracy was
won, a national student convention would elect a permanent union
leadership.
   Government-run newspapers began to circulate again Sunday,
carrying pictures and stories of anti-government demonstrations.
   Employees demanding press freedom had forced all six government
newspapers, four in the Burmese language and two in English, to
close for three days.
   ``We agreed to return to work on promises by the authorities
that we can now write freely,'' said an editorial assistant of one
newspapers.
   Although the newspapers played down reports of anti-government
agitation, Burmese readers noted that such articles and photographs
could never have appeared in the press in past decades.
   A Western diplomat in Rangoon said that although the capital was
relatively quiet Sunday, food stocks were reduced and people had to
go to more than one market to get enough food.
   Pro-democracy strikes halted all rail service and reduced bus
service last week. Union Burma Airways, which earlier last week
halted domestic flights, suspended international service on Friday,
the diplomat said on condition of anonymity.
   The strikes also closed oil refineries, crippled factories and
left foreign ships waiting at Rangoon's river port, officials said
Saturday.
   The turmoil in Burma began July 23 when 77-year-old Ne Win
resigned and the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party chose
hardliner Sein Lwin as his replacement.
   Mass student-led demonstrations followed. Troops shot unarmed
protestors, but the rallies continued until Sein Lwin quit and was
replaced as president Aug. 19 by civilian lawyer Maung Maung.
Rallies have been peaceful since then.
   In Dhaka, Bangladesh, thousands of people converged on a
southern sea resort after hearing Ne Win was hiding there, a
newspaper said Sunday.
   The Bangladesh Observer, an independent English-language daily,
reported Ne Win crossed into Bangladesh and was staying at a motel
in Coxs Bazar, about 185 miles south of Dhaka.
   It said thousands of people who rushed to the motel, hoping to
catch a glimpse of the former dictator, were told by police he was
not there or anywhere in town.
   Another Bangladesh newspaper, the mass-circulation Ittefaq, said
the former ruler and a 26-member entourage had taken shelter at a
Buddhist monastery in eastern Bangladesh.
   The Foreign Office in Dhaka dismissed both reports as ``baseless
rumors.''

   Three Italian air force jets
collided and crashed during an air show at a U.S. military base
Sunday, and a state government official said up to 31 people were
feared dead.
   A police spokesman in nearby Kaiserslautern said at least 100
people were injured at Ramstein Air Base, some of them seriously.
One of the airplanes plowed into the crowd on the ground,
eyewitnesses said.
   ``We fear that in all likelihood 30 or 31 people are dead,''
Rhineland-Palatinate state government spokesman Hennes Schreiner
said in a telephone interview.
   Schreiner said state governor Bernhard Vogel immediately headed
to the base 60 miles southwest of Frankfurt to help supervise joint
German-American rescue efforts.
   Base spokesman Doug Moore said the dead included the three
pilots, and ``those dead on the ground are a mix of civilian and
military.''
   Moore said investigators were still piecing together the
sequence of events. He said it was not certain whether all three
planes collided at once or whether two first hit each other and the
third later become involved. All three planes crashed, he said.
   Bernd Nagel, a spokesman for Rhineland-Palatinate state, said
eyewitnesses reported that one of the planes plowed directly into
the crowd of spectators.
   Willi Hollaender, a police spokesman in Kaiserslautern, told the
AP that at least 100 people were injured, ``several of them
seriously.''
   The planes involved were of the type Airmacchi MB 339A,
according to Hollaender. He said eyewitnesses reported that one of
the planes crashed into the crowd.
   Officials said the planes belonged to the ``Frecce Tricolori''
flying team of the Italian air force.
   Hesse State radio in Frankfurt said that about 15 people had
received ``serious burns.''

<HEAD>Puyallup Indians Vote To Accept Land Claim Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Puyallup Indian Tribe has voted
overwhelmingly to end years of negotiations and accept a $162
million offer in return for giving up claim to one-time reservation
land that includes parts of Tacoma.
   ``The agreement works to everyone's benefit,'' Gabriel Landry of
the Puyallup Tribal Council said after Saturday's 319-162 vote.
   A legal battle for the disputed land ``might've taken 20 or 30
years,'' and would be expensive, Landry added. He said he also
believed Puyallups would've been subjected to an anti-Indian
backlash if they'd taken the various government bodies involved to
court.
   At issue is who owns what within the boundaries of the old
reservation, which includes parts of downtown Tacoma, the city's
northeast side and the Tacoma Tideflats, now home of the booming
Port of Tacoma, the nation's 16th largest port.
   Treaties dating from the 1850s gave the Puyallups a reservation
of about 18,000 acres. Over the years, holdings dwindled as land
allotted to individual members was sold in what tribal historians
say often were shady or fraudulent deals.
   Two decades ago, about all that was left was a 35-acre cemetery.
But tribal activists fought the state and local governments over
treaty rights and land claims, and vigorous enrollment efforts
boosted the tribe's membership from a low point of about 400.
Today, the tribe has about 1,500 members.
   In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a ruling giving the
tribe title to 12 acres of former Puyallup River bed. That opened
the question of whether the tribe could lay claim to more land.
   The settlement is to include about $77 million from the federal
government, $21 million from the state and the balance from the
city of Tacoma, the Port of Tacoma and private property owners,
including Union Pacific Railroad.
   The next challenge is to get appropriations from Congress and
from the state Legislature to help finance the package, said U.S.
Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash.
   He said he would introduce legislation in the House and Sen. Dan
Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Select Committee on Indians,
would introduce the legislation in the Senate.
   The proposal may not reach Congress until next year, Dicks added.
   The tribe voted 118-102 to reject a proposed $140 million
settlement in February 1986. Had the tribe rejected this proposal,
it would have gone to court to claim the land.
   ``Years of litigation would have been enormously expensive and
somebody loses,'' Dicks said. ``This way, both the community and
the tribe can win and I think that's better for everyone.''
   Frank Wright Jr., administrative manager for the tribe, has said
he sees the settlement as an opportunity to strengthen the tribe
economically and provide a better future for its members. He was
ousted as tribal council chairman after the earlier proposal was
rejected.
   Lynn Anderson, port spokeswoman, said the decision will give
private landowners clear title and help confirm exactly who owns
what, and allow work with the tribe on issues of fisheries and
development.
   The complex package promises a number of thing to the tribe,
including $20,000 in cash to each adult tribal member, a variety of
economic development programs, 900 acres of land, job training, a
substance-abuse treatment center, fish enhancement programs and a
$22 million permanent tribal trust fund.
   Some members remained strongly opposed to the deal, but Landry
said he thought a combination of the length of time involved in the
negotiations and the fact that the new proposal was better helped
persuade members to approve it.
   ``People are tired of hearing it. And they really do see the
advantages,'' he said.
   While ``there's no way we can put a value on the amount of loss
that we've had, this gives us an opportunity to put our tribe on
the map,'' Landry said. ``I'm looking foward. I'm not looking back
at the injustices we've suffered. ''

   Rivers' new book will cover her career climb, including her
stint as a late-night talk show host, and her husband Edgar's
suicide, New York Magazine reports in its Aug. 29 issue.
   ``It will be a real woman's story _ the tale of an astonishing
actress and comedienne who is slowly building her life,'' said
Susan Kamil, an editor at Random House.
   According to the magazine, Random House paid $400,000 for the

   The entertainers cooperated with the Los Angeles chapter of

teen-agers, is a first of its kind.
   ``If it makes people think twice about getting into a car drunk,
I think it's great,'' Nguyen said in a telephone interview from

   He added: ``I think it's definitely going to have an effect.''
   Nguyen posed with Holly Robinson and Peter De Luise on the hood

   The actors and actresses also provided statements that will be
used in captions under their photos.
   Money raised from sales of the $7.95 calendar will be used to

   Sen. Quentin Burdick is recovering well
from colon surgery he underwent last week and is ``very anxious''
to leave the hospital, according to an aide.
   The North Dakota Democrat doesn't like hospitals, Jean
Brodshaug, Burdick's press secretary, said in a telephone interview
from Washington.
   Doctors say Burdick, 80, should be able to leave the Bethesda
Naval Hospital in Maryland by midweek, Brodshaug said Saturday.
   Surgeons removed 18 inches of Burdick's colon Thursday after an
earlier exam detected a cancerous polyp in the colon. Burdick had
three of the growths removed from his colon last month; tests
showed one of them was malignant.

   Actor Paul Newman will portray the late
Earl Long in a movie about the Louisiana governor's romance with
former striptease artist Blaze Starr, according to a writer who
helped Starr with her autobiography.
   Ron Shelton, writer and director of this summer's hit movie
``Bull Durham,'' will direct the movie, to be titled ``Blaze,''
Huey Perry said.
   ``We've been working with Ron since 1981 and sometimes I thought
the story of Blaze would never reach the screen,'' Perry said.
   Last week, Shelton told a Baltimore newspaper that the movie has
a budget of $50 million to $60 million.
   Filming is expected to take place next spring, ``probably in
Louisiana,'' Perry said, adding that the role of Starr has not been
cast yet.
   Starr, who lives in Oakland, Md., told The (Huntington)
Herald-Dispatch Friday that she was visiting her mother in
Wilsondale, Mingo County, last week when she heard that Touchstone
Pictures had agreed to the deal. She said she's excited that Newman
will play Long, who died in 1960 at age 65.
   The movie will focus on the part of Starr's 1974 autobiography
that discusses her love affair in the late 1950s with the populist
governor known as ``Ole Earl.'' The affair took place while Starr
was a stripper on Bourbon Street in New Orleans before she moved to
Baltimore and gained a national reputation.
   Long left Starr $50,000 in his will, but his widow prevented her
from collecting the money. Starr, 56, is retired from the
striptease business and makes jewelry that she sells at craft shows.

<HEAD>China Says Vietnam Trying To Maintain Hold On Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet and Chinese diplomats Sunday began talks
on ending Cambodia's civil war, and a Chinese government newspaper
said Vietnam was trying to maintain control of Cambodia after it
ends its 10-year occupation.
   The commentary, prominently displayed on the front-page of the
People's Daily, accused Vietnam of ``playing games'' with
international attempts to bring peace to Cambodia.
   The nationally televised evening news said the talks between
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev and his Chinese
counterpart opened Sunday morning.
   It showed footage of the two sides sitting down at a long
conference table but did not give any details about the meeting.
The talks, which are closed to foreign reporters, are expected to
last a week.
   Rogachev said Saturday he thought a breakthrough was at hand.
   Neither China nor the Soviet Union are direct participants in
the Cambodian conflict, but Moscow gives financial support to
Vietnam and China supports the three-party resistance coalition
headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   China wants the Soviet Union to put pressure on Vietnam to
withdraw all its 120,000 troops from Cambodia at an early date,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua said last week.
   A settlement on the Cambodian question would remove the last
obstacle to normalized Chinese-Soviet relations and pave the way
for a summit meeting between Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
   The People's Daily editorial reiterated China's stand that ``the
key to a political settlement of the Cambodian question is the
withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.''
   Hanoi in May agreed to withdraw 50,000 troops this year and the
remainder by 1990.
   But the editorial said: ``Vietnam's so-called `troop withdrawl
by 1990' is but a lie.''
   It recalled that in the past Vietnamese withdrawals amounted to
nothing more than troop rotations. It also said some Vietnamese
soldiers were discharged and told to settle in Cambodia to help in
the ``Vietnamization'' of the country.
   The editorial also accused Vietnam of delaying its troop
withdrawal by using worldwide concern that the Khmer Rouge, which
slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people during its 1975-1978
rule, might again gain power.
   ``The international community must not only guard against the
Khmer Rouge gaining power but even more must firmly oppose the
faction of Hun Sen gaining sole power,'' the newspaper warned.
   Prime Minister Hun Sen leads the Vietnamese-installed government
in Phnom Penh.
   Chinese Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, in a meeting with
visiting Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita on Friday, issued
the same warning.
   ``The more immediate danger is that Vietnam is trying by every
possible means to legalize the puppet regime in Cambodia,'' he said.
   The People's Daily editorial concluded with a call for continued
international pressure on Vietnam to leave Cambodia and allow the
Cambodian people to set up their own government.
   China supports a four-party coalition government made up of the
three resistance factions and Hun Sen's government and headed by
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk.

   Soviet bloc agents may have had
access to NATO defense secrets at a U.S. Army base for decades
before a former U.S. sergeant was charged with spying there, a West
German newspaper said Sunday.
   West Germany last week announced the arrest of former U.S. Army
Sgt. Clyde Lee Conrad, who since the late 1970s allegedly sold
classified information from the Army base in Bad Kreuznach.
   Officials said Conrad, 41, revealed secrets about nuclear
missile bases, pipeline systems and troop strength to Hungarian
agents, who passed them on to the Kremlin and other Soviet bloc
countries.
   But the spy ring may have been receiving NATO information long
before Conrad became active, according to the Welt am Sonntag
newspaper, which quoted information from unidentified U.S.
investigators.
   Conrad was in charge of safekeeping classified NATO documents,
which were held in a safe at the Bad Kreuznach base. The newspaper
said U.S. security officers believe Conrad's predecessor at the
base documentation center also worked for the Hungarian secret
service.
   The report said Hungary, a Soviet bloc ally, for years
``systematically'' targeted Americans in West Germany. It said
Conrad's predecessor was a U.S. military officer of Hungarian
descent who sold NATO information to Hungarian agents. It did not
give his name, did not specify how long he worked at the base and
did not say where he is now.
   ``There is the fear that for decades top NATO secrets have gone
to the Soviet bloc from Americans in West Germany,'' the newspaper
said.
   Norm Medland, the duty officer at the public information office
of the U.S. Army European Headquarters in Heidelberg, told The
Associated Press Sunday that an investigation was continuing. He
would not elaborate.
   Medland also refused comment on the report in the Hamburg-based
Welt am Sonntag, a conservative, nationally circulated Sunday
newspaper.
   Investigators said Conrad reported to a Hungarian ``spymaster''
living in Vienna and that two Hungarian-born Swedish brothers _
Sandor Kercsik, 48, and Imre Kercsik, 34 _ admitted working for the
Hungarian intelligence service. Prosecutors say the brothers acted
as couriers in the spy ring allegedly headed by Conrad. The
brothers were arraigned last week in Sweden.
   Welt am Sonntag said the spymaster has been found but that he is
safe from prosecution under Austrian law. It did not elaborate.
   The newspaper said investigators believe Conrad was paid $1.1
million by Soviet bloc countries for the information.
   The Conrad family ``had so much of everything,'' neighbor
Johanna Horst told the unofficial U.S. military newspaper Stars and
Stripes. Mrs. Horst said Conrad's wife, Antje, ``had lots of gold
jewelry and he just gave her a new car with her initials in gold.''
   Stars and Stripes said Saturday that Conrad, who left the Army
in 1985, received a monthly pension of $900.
   West German invesigators said they believe Conrad kept the money
in Swiss bank accounts, according to the CBS television network.
Swiss prosecutors Friday launched an investigation.
   The former sergeant remains in prison and faces espionage
charges that carry a maximum 10-year sentence.
   Among other charges, he allegedly paid another U.S. soldier ``a
five-figure sum'' for obtaining secret information, according to
chief West German prosecutor Kurt Rebmann.
   No charges have been filed against the soldier, who has left the
Army but is still in West Germany, the Die Welt newspaper of Bonn
said Saturday.
   The former soldier apparently provided information leading to
Conrad's arrest on Tuesday, Die Welt said.
   U.S. Army officials said Conrad, of Sebring, Ohio, obtained a
top secret security clearance in 1978 and kept it when he left the
service.

<HEAD>Rocket Attack on Kabul Airport Damaged Plane, Runways</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least one transport plane may have
been destroyed and some runways damaged when Afghan guerrillas
rocketed Kabul airport for more than two hours, Western diplomats
said Sunday.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said four people were
killed and 17 injured during the attack Saturday, which the
diplomats said lasted more than two hours.
   It was not known if the attack was the same as that reported
Saturday on an unidentified part of Kabul, in which Tass said four
were killed.
   The Western diplomats, quoting a dispatch from their embassy in
the Afghan capital, said more than 20 rockets hit the
civilian-military airport Saturday afternoon and early evening.
   It said helicopters and jet fighters scrambled but several large
aircraft remained on the ground.
   ``A Western diplomat saw several rockets hit directly in front
of the old airport control tower, about 200 yards to the north, and
then saw three rockets impact directly between the main runways,
apparently damaging at least one of them,'' the dispatch said.
   The diplomats spoke to journalists and provided the dispatch on
condition of anonymity.
   The dispatch said damage to aircraft was not confirmed visually,
but the airport remained closed Saturday night.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979, and an
estimated 100,000 troops have been helping the Marxist government
fight the Moslem rebels.
   The guerrillas have stepped up attacks on the capital and
provincial centers since Red Army troops began withdrawing from
Afghanistan May 15 under a U.N.-brokered accord.
   Diplomats said Saturday's attack appeared to come from only a
few miles southeast of the airport. It indicated the rebels had
penetrated the heavy security ringing the city.
   Reports from the war zones indicate the rebels hold two Afghan
provincial capitals and have besieged at least two more.
   Afghan leader Najib said in a speech to the country's national
assembly Saturday that his government planned to declare
``coalition or neutral zones'' on the basis of negotiations with
``armed opposition groups.''
   The rebels had no immediate reaction. Guerrilla leaders have
refused to negotiate with the Marxists, whom they see as Soviet
puppets.
   The seven-party guerrilla alliance, based in Peshawar, Pakistan,
announced plans of its own Sunday to hold elections in refugee
camps and ``liberated areas'' inside Afghanistan.
   Winning candidates would form a legislative body under an
interim Cabinet named among guerrilla leaders last June.
   Rebel spokesman have said their government would set up soon in
Afghanistan but have given no dates. They said they hope to hold
elections early this fall.

<HEAD>Chicago Officials Declare Month-old Smoking Ban a Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PERKISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A month after the Windy City snuffed out smoking
in public places, sending smokers huffing to puff outside or in
designated areas, officials in the nation's third-largest city say
the ban is a success.
   ``If complaints are an efficient barometer of what's going on,
then the law is working,'' said Patrick Lenihan, deputy
commissioner for planning in the Department of Health. ``We haven't
heard too much about it.''
   But some restaurant operators say the ordinance, which forces
eateries to guarantee patrons a non-smoking area, has created
problems.
   ``It's costing us money because in order to keep a non-smoking
area, we have to keep waiters on the job rather than sending them
home and closing part of the restaurant,'' said Peter Tung, manager
of Trader Vic's.
   ``We're finding that at certain times some of our non-smoking
customers have to wait an extra five or 10 minutes,'' said William
Marquardt, vice president of the Berghoff restaurant. ``When that
happens there's some grumbling.''
   The law, which bans smoking in restaurants, stores, businesses,
airports, bus terminals, subway stations and taxis, took effect
July 25.
   But the City Council passed the ordinance without setting up a
mechanism to enforce the law, which calls for $25 to $100 fines,
and no one has been cited for violations.
   Lenihan said the Health Department and the Council are working
to set up regulations for enforcing the ordinance. Rules should be
on the books in about a month.
   Similar laws have been passed in New York, Los Angeles and other
cities around the country.
   ``We're finding that businesses, stores and restaurants are
trying to come into compliance with the law voluntarilly,'' Lenihan
said. ``In 90 percent of the cases the honor system is working.''
   ``Almost 75 percent of our customers are non-smokers so for them
the law is a plus,'' said Michael Cameron, general manager of
Michael Stuart's Restaurant. ``At least half the restaurant is
non-smoking and we're going to expand it.''
   Lenihan said the few complaints received by the Health
Department have been about small restaurants that have not stopped
their patrons from lighting up.
   Other complaints have come from passengers reporting taxi
drivers lighting up in their cabs.
   ``We've gotten a few of those, but not too many,'' said Patricia
Masters of the mayor's Office of Inquiry and Information. ``It's
been fairly quiet.''
   Some cabbies said they would keep on puffing despite the ban.
   ``Some laws I obey and some I don't'' said Watson Rembert. ``I
still smoke but I just don't do it in front of the police. If I
want to smoke, I'll light up because I'm a smoker.''
   On the corporate front, Mary Jean Houde, a spokeswoman for Sears
Roebuck and Co., said there had been no complaints in the company's
8,000-worker headquarters since the ban took effect.
   Sears placed ``no smoking'' signs in the lobby of the Sears
Tower and also put them in bathrooms and conference rooms, she said.
   Ms. Houde declined to say how much Sears spent to comply with
the new law.
   ``Prior to the law taking effect we had designated employee
lounges as either smoking or non-smoking,'' Ms. Houde said. ``We're
complying and nobody seems to be upset about it.''

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lisbon's biggest fire in two centuries
destroyed much of the old Moorish quarter in the heart of the city
and fueled fears that other such disasters may follow.
   Thursday's blaze reduced the historic 10-block Chiado shopping
district to smoldering ruins. Critics blamed the city's antiquated
firefighting equipment and lax safety rules.
   ``(What) Else Will Be Burned?'' asked the newsmagazine Sabado.
   Architect Tomas Taveira, who watched the hand-painted tile
facades go up in flames, said he saw ancient fire trucks crawling
towards the blaze an hour after it was reported at 3 a.m.
   ``Portugal has to look toward progress in a different way,''
Taveira said.
   Jose Ferreira de Matos, president of the Lisbon Shopowners
Association, called the outdated equipment ``shameful.''
   Some of the fire trucks _ which are at least 30 years old _ were
used in the Portuguese colonial wars in Africa in the 1960s and
early 1970s. About half of the 800 or so firefighters who battled
the blaze were volunteers from fire stations near Lisbon, who came
with equipment that was even older than the city's.
   Sabado wrote that the citizens of Lisbon long have sensed ``how
little is being done to avoid such disasters.''
   Reports said none of the old wood frame buildings in the area
had sprinkler systems, including the 19th century Armazens do
Grandela department store, where the blaze started. No one could
remember when fire officials last inspected the buildings.
   The city's media agreed it was ``a miracle'' only one man died
and 43 people were injured in the fire, which started before crowds
filled the popular area.
   The flames swept through the narrow streets with their specialty
shops and cafes, where artists, writers and musicians gathered.
Lawyers, whose offices were on fire, scurried down the slippery
streets carrying documents and were joined by fleeing residents
carrying cats, dogs and caged parakeets.
   The fire left 40 stores gutted, about 2,000 people jobless and
damages Ferreira de Matos estimated at $600 million.
   Fire officials say they don't know what caused the blaze, the
worst in the capital in 200 years, but news reports raised the
possibility of arson. Ferreira De Matos said firefighters were
victims of a bureaucracy that shows no concern for the welfare of
this city of 900,000.
   Jose Manuel Fernandes, writing in the weekly Expresso in
December, said Lisbon has been without direction or a coherent
urban plan since the death of Mayor Duarte Pacheco in 1948.
   Mayor Nuno Kruz Abecasis has presided over the city council for
10 of the 14 years since a 1974 leftist coup ended nearly half a
century of dictatorship in Portugal.
   As the country floundered after the revolution, the mayor came
under increasing criticism for leaving Lisbon prey to real estate
speculators, who ignored safety or architectural integrity.
   The Chiado neighborhood, which was completed in 1840, was a
symbol of Lisbon's literary and artistic past as well as haven for
its new artists and designers.
   Construction of the old quarter _ whose style was considered
revolutionary for its time _ was begun after a 1755 earthquake and
subsequent fire and tidal wave destroyed much of medieval Lisbon.
   ``It's a terrible shame that the fire had to strike the Chiado,
where young Portuguese were learning to take pride in the city's
heritage,'' said longtime resident Carole Gorton. Authorities said
it will be a year before reconstruction begins.
   French President Francois Mitterrand offered his country's aid
to repair the damage caused by ``the catastrophe that touched the
heart of Lisbon.''
   But critics have little confidence that officials will put such
aid to proper use. They say the money is likely to be frittered
away on projects that help only those who propose them.
   The state-owned Diaro de Noticias said in an editorial that the
Chiado fire must teach the people of Lisbon that they can no longer
indulge in their favorite pastime of ``deixar andar'' _ letting
things pass.

<TEXT>
   Smoke-filled air and
reduced access to parts of Yellowstone National Park because of
forest fires have reduced the numbers of tourists and prompted the
early closure of some of park lodgings.
   The 296-room Lake Hotel on the north shore of Yellowstone Lake
usually stays open through late September
   But just 76 of the recently renovated hotel's rooms were filled
Saturday night, and on Sunday visitors were told the hotel was
closing as of 11 a.m.
   Nearby Lake Lodge, with 180 rooms, will remain open for the time
being.
   With access to the Lake area restricted to only the east
entrance of the park, and the famous Old Faithful Geyser
inaccessible, except from the north and west entrances, it wasn't
profitable to keep the majestic victorian hotel open, said Steve
Tedder, vice president and general manager of TW Recreational
Services Inc., Yellowstone's concessionaire.
   ``Basically the overall situation is, with the current fire
condition, unpredictable road conditions, the smoke conditions,
business has declined significantly over the past week,'' he said.
   At nearby Fishing Bridge, just 16 of the 320 recreational
vehicle sites were filled, he said.
   Lake Hotel is the latest Yellowstone lodging facility closed in
recent weeks by forest fires that have charred roughly 400,000
acres of the country's first national park.
   Earlier this month, the Grant Village complex, which contains a
hotel, a campground and employee dormitories, was closed when the
Red and Shoshone fires approached from the west.
   Last week, the Canyon area was evacuated when flames from the
33,265-acre Wolf Lake fire burned to within one-half mile of the
complex, which now houses a firefighters' camp.
   While the flames have stayed away from the Lake area, the smoke
has not. Guests go to sleep at night smelling smoke and wake up in
the morning to the acrid stench.
   Flames can be seen from Canyon, and the road from Canyon to
Norris and south to Madison Junction is lined by acre after acre of
charred, smouldering trees. In some areas, burning trees can be
seen from the roads, and snags _ burned-out trees that have toppled
_ occasionally line road shoulders.
   Tourists determined to see Yellowstone despite the fires can
stop along the few roads that are open, to watch herds of elk and
bison grazing in unburned meadows or to see columns of smoke rising
thousands of feet into the sky.
   The tourist drought has not yet seriously affected the Old
Faithful area, which Tedder called ``one of the least smoky areas
of the park.''
   On Friday night 296 of the 320 rooms in the Old Faithful Inn
were filled, while Saturday night, 192 of the rooms were taken, he
said.
   However, getting from one side of the park to the other is
impossible at times, Tedder said.
   ``At this point, there is no access to the interior of the
park,'' he said.
   The drop in business has cost TW Services more than $1 million
in sales, although Tedder didn't have an estimate of the overall
drop including the reduction in lodging reservations.
   The company is negotiating with its insurance companies to see
if some of the losses can be recouped, he said, and talks also will
be held with the National Park Service to see if the
concessionaire's contract can be altered.
   Under that contract TW Services is required to pump 22 percent
of its gross sales back into Yellowstone in maintenance and
improvements.
   The company also has a 5 percent profit cap in its contract,
whereby any profits above 5 percent must be funneled back into the
facilities, said Tedder.

   A federal prison escapee who held his
estranged wife's boyfriend in a closet for more than two days and
later took the woman hostage killed himself early Sunday after a
12-hour standoff, officials said.
   Both hostages escaped without injury shortly after electricity
and gas to the house were shut off, the Multnomah County Sheriff's
Department said.
   Later, Herbert Lamar Weeks, 47, was found dead in the garage of
the house, an apparent victim of carbon monoxide poisoning,
according to a news release from the department.
   Weeks had kept police at bay since Saturday afternoon when
Weeks' wife, Marilyn, 40, telephoned a friend, who believed
something was wrong and notified the sheriff's department,
sheriff's spokesman Bart Whalen said.
   Deputy U.S. Marshal Shaun Means said Weeks had tied Mrs. Weeks'
boyfriend, identified by sheriff's deputies as Roddy Bergsma, 47,
and placed him in a closet Thursday. Mrs. Weeks apparently came
home Saturday afternoon and also was held against her will, Means
said.
   Sheriff's spokesman Jim Davis said a divorce had been pending
between Weeks and his wife.
   While a deputy was sent to the Weeks' residence, a sheriff's
dispatcher telephoned the house and Weeks told her he was heavily
armed and had a bomb.
   Nine homes in a one-block area of the suburban east Portland
neighborhood were evacuated. No shots were fired during the
standoff, deputies said.
   ``There wasn't much more conversation beyond that,'' Whalen
said. ``There weren't any demands or anything. Fortunately, the
officer had not gotten there, so there was no confrontation.''
   Deputies tried unsuccessfully to persuade Weeks to leave the
house. At 2:30 a.m. utilities lines into the house were shut off;
12 minutes later, Mrs. Weeks and Bergsma escaped, deputies said.
   Means said he was unsure how the pair got away from Weeks.
   Weeks was listed as an escapee on Aug. 21 from Lompoc Federal
Penitentiary in Lompoc, Calif., where he had been serving two
consecutive five-year terms, deputies said.
   He was convicted in U.S. District Court in Portland on Dec. 18
of interstate auto theft, altering vehicle identification numbers
and interstate fraud, Means said.

   A Finnish military training aircraft
crashed at an air show Sunday, killing the pilot, police said. It
was the second fatal crash at a Belgian air show in three weeks.
   The plane, a Redigo, belonged to the state-owned Finnish
aircraft maker Valmet, which recently sold 10 such planes to the
Finnish air force for training purposes.
   Police said another Redigo plane took part in the air show
organized by the Belgian air force at Kleine Brogel Air Base, 68
miles northeast of Brussels.
   Witnesses said the two planes were circling at about 3.30 p.m.
when one of them, piloted by Ari Piippo, failed to come out of a
spin and fell to the ground. Officials said the plane was flying
too low for the pilot to use his ejection seat.
   On Aug. 7, a Belgian pilot died when his Mirage-5 jetfighter
crashed at an air show, also organized by the Belgian Air Force, at
Leopoldsburg, seven miles west of Kleine Brogel Air Base.

   Police shut down a federation of 108
Palestinian charities Sunday and accused it of being a PLO front.
In the West Bank, the body of an alleged Arab collaborator with
Israel was found burned and tied to an electric pole.
   A Jewish settler opened fire on stone-throwing Palestinians who
smashed the windshield of his car in the West Bank town of
Qalqiliya, wounding two of the attackers, military officials said.
Arab reports denied the settler was provoked.
   The raid on the charity association followed the closing last
week of seven Arab professional associations and the Nablus offices
of a federation of 45 trade unions aligned with PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction.
   The crackdown was designed to keep the Palestine Liberation
Organization from taking over organizations that were controlled by
Jordan's King Hussein before he severed ties with the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip last month.
   The Israeli moves were part of a larger effort to disrupt the
grassroots organization of the 8-month-old Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule in the territories Israel seized in the 1967
Middle East War.
   The burned and blood-stained body of Samih Youssef Dababsi was
found tied to an electric pole in the Harti Sheikh neighborhood of
Hebron, Arab reports and an Israeli photographer said.
   The victim was beaten on the head and his hands were tied to his
side, the reports said. Palestinian sources described the victim as
a collaborator with Israeli authorities. Police said he was a thief.
   An army official, speaking on the basis of anonymity, confirmed
the killing.
   The underground leadership of the uprising has demanded that
Palestinians working for Israel resign. In the past week,
Palestinians and alleged collaborabors with Israeli authorities
have clashed at least seven times.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, 255 Palestinians have been
killed, most by Israeli gunfire. Four Israelis also have died.
   In Jerusalem, police raided the Federation of Charitable
Societies after West Bank military commander Maj. Gen. Amram
Mitzneh ordered it closed for one year.
   The charity office distributed PLO finances ``under cover of
financial aid and charity,'' a government statement said.
   Police also closed the Maktabat El Haya news agency for a year.
The statement said the agency was used to advance the goals of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Damascus-based PLO
faction headed by George Habash.
   Ellen El Araj, deputy head of the charity group, denied the
organization had political goals and said many of the group's
projects would be hurt by the closing.
   She said its activities include helping the poor and handicapped
and providing funds for youngsters to attend pre-schools.
   ``I don't know why the Israelis are carrying out this campaign,
and I denounce it,'' said Mrs. El Araj, 68.
   She said the federation includes 108 charities in Jerusalem that
are funded by Arab charitable organizations in Jordan and by
Aramco, the Saudi Arabian oil company.
   Col. Ranaan Gissin, deputy army spokesman, said the charitable
groups acted as a conduit for PLO funds and that the trade unions
tried to recruit and organize for Fatah.
   He said such organizations long had been affiliated with PLO
factions but had been dormant in the past.
   Gissin said PLO activity increased after Jordan broke ties with
the occupied lands and Israel arrested more than 300 community
leaders.
   Most were members of the recently outlawed popular communities
and strike forces that organized anti-Israeli boycotts, strikes and
demonstrations as part of the uprising.
   The crackdown created a public relations problem for Israeli
authorities because the groups were also doing work that helped the
Palestinian community.
   ``We have to think twice because they serve other functions such
as improving working conditions and social welfare. We don't want
to stop these activities, but when it involves the PLO we have no
choice,'' Gissin said.
   Meanwhile, police were searching for the killer of of an
8-year-old Israeli boy, Hanan Zagor, whose body was found Saturday
in a dry riverbed in his home village of Qiryat Tivon, about 10
miles south of Haifa.
   Nearby police found a large rock believed to be the murder
weapon and the youth's skullcap, a sign that he was a religiously
observant Jew.
   Israel radio quoted police officials as saying the investigation
was centering on possible Arab suspects, but they had not
determined if the motive was terrorist or criminal.
   In another development, officials of the country's Egged bus
cooperative said buses that travel in the West Bank are being
equipped with shatter-proof windows. They said nearly 1,700 buses
have been damaged by stones and firebombs during the Palestinian
uprising.

   Richard P. Chapman, former chairman of
the board and president of New England Merchants National Bank and
longtime Boston civic leader, has died. He was 83.
   Chapman died Friday at Mary Hitchcock Hospital in Hanover, N.H.,
according to his family.
   Chapman, who joined the old Merchants National Bank of Boston as
a 22-year-old Harvard graduate, became president in 1952.
   Under Chapman's leadership, New England Merchants became
Boston's fourth-largest bank. Chapman became chairman of the board
in 1964 and retired in 1970.
   During his administration the bank merged with the Day Trust Co.
and the New England Trust Co. and acquired the assets of the
Pilgrim Trust Co. Eventually, it was renamed the New England
Merchants National Bank. In 1970, Merchants formed a one-bank
holding company, New England Merchants Co. Inc.
   In 1972 he was honored by the Harvard Business School Associates
of Boston as Boston's Business Statesman of the Year. In 1960 he
received the highest award of the National Conference of Christians
and Jews.
   Survivors include his wife, a son and a daughter.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush spent a low-key Sunday
to wind up a four-day Texas visit that he called ``a good swing''
in this key election state that is his adopted home.
   The Republican presidential nominee attended an Astros baseball
game, church services and a memorial service for former Gov. Price
Daniel, a longtime friend.
   ``We've had a good swing,'' Bush said. ``We've had a good three
to four days here. We've got to work hard, but it's doable.''
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said the campaign was
``very excited'' about the reception Bush during the series of
campaign appearances that began Thursday. He mentioned in
particular the rally in Longview that drew about 2,500 people on
Thursday.
   Fuller said Dukakis' selection of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as a
running mate ``raises the stakes in Texas,'' which is worth 29 of
the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
   Talking aboard Air Force Two, Fuller said Bush will continue to
stress defense in the coming week and paint Democratic rival
Michael Dukakis as weak on defense. Fuller said the campaign feels
that theme is going over well.
   Bush was heading Monday to St. Louis to tour an aerospace plant,
and then to Nashville, Tenn.
   Fuller said Bush would likely return to Texas by mid-September,
and in the meantime send surrogates and family members to work the
state.
   But Bush told reporters he wasn't engaging in any politics on
Sunday.
   The captain of his baseball team at Yale, Bush showed off his
pitching style by throwing out the first ball in the Astrodome as
the Houston Astros hosted the Pittsburgh Pirates.
   He told reporters he was there for ``pure R and R.''
   ``I know you won't believe it _ no politics today,'' he said
before donning an Astros jacket.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, also attended the memorial service
in Austin for Daniel, who died Thursday after suffering a stroke.
   Mrs. Bush told reporters aboard Air Force Two that Daniel, a
Democrat, and his wife were old family friends of the Bushes.
   ``They were friends _ a different party, but friends,'' she said.
   She said she and her husband met Daniel in 1953, introduced by
Bush's parents, and became friendly as fellow Texans. Bush's
father, Prescott, and Daniel had both served in the U.S. Senate.
   Earlier Sunday, Bush attended services at St. Martin's Episcopal
Church near the Houston hotel complex where he maintains an
official address, and had lunch at Molina's Mexican restaurant,
owned by old family friends.

   Michael Dukakis received an enthusiastic
welcome Sunday at a concert to celebrate composer Leonard
Bernstein's 70th birthday and spoke briefly to Secretary of State
George Shultz, who also attended the event.
   The Democratic presidential nominee was spending the weekend at
his father-in-law's cottage in nearby Tyringham in advance of a
two-day gubernatorial visit to western Massachusetts.
   He arrived at Tanglewood, a favorite concert location, for the
Bernstein celebration after attending a barbecue at the home of
family friends. He was accompanied to both events by his wife,
Kitty.
   Dukakis was cheered as he walked through the crowd to his box
and patiently signed autographs as hundreds swarmed around the
seats to catch a glimpse of the governor.
   Dukakis rose from his seat and walked to a nearby aisle to greet
Shultz and his wife, who own a summer home here in the Berkshire
Hills.
   Shultz and Dukakis shook hands and spoke briefly before the
secretary proceeded to his nearby box. One woman who fought her way
through the crowd to get Dukakis' autograph ran up to Shultz and
got his on the same piece of paper.
   The curious spectators quickly took their seats as the concert
by the Boston Symphony Orchestra began. It was part of a four-day
celebration marking Bernstein's birthday.
   Dukakis was to tour several western Massachusetts communities
Monday and Tuesday as part of his annual summer visit to the
region. He also planned to use the area, which is rebounding
economically, for two national economic speeches. He was returning
to Boston Tuesday night and departing for a campaign swing through
western states Wednesday.
   He flew to western Massachusetts on Saturday after attending the
March on Washington marking the 25th anniversary of a civil rights
march led by Martin Luther King Jr.

   Storms drenched the lower half of the Atlantic coast on Sunday,
with tornadoes spawned by Tropical Storm Chris hitting three North
Carolina counties.
   The tropical storm was downgraded to a tropical depression late
Sunday after it moved ashore near Charleston, S.C. Showers and
thunderstorms were over much of South Carolina, eastern Georgia and
western North Carolina. Showers also extended across central
Virginia to New Jersey.
   Damages were estimated as high as $1 million in North Carolina's
western central Iredell County, where two tornadoes touched down
Sunday, said Al Warlick, a spokesman for the state Department of
Crime Control and Public Safety. Sheriffs' dispatchers reported
tornado sightings in two other counties.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms extended from the lower Great
Lakes region to the southern high Plains early Sunday afternoon.
Thunderstorms produced heavy downpours in eastern New York.
   Showers and thunderstorms were also reported in southern
Florida. Showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered along the
central and western Gulf coast.
   Sunny skies prevailed from the upper Great Lakes through the
northern and central Plains to the northern and central Pacific
coast.
   Rainfall totals for the six-hour period ended at 2 p.m. EDT
included more than an inch and a half at Charleston, S.C.; more
than an inch at Beaufort, S.C.; more than eight-tenths of an inch
at Myrtle Beach, S.C.; and three quarters of an inch at Burlington,
Vt.
   Temperatures warmed into the 80s from south-central and eastern
Texas to Georgia and Florida. Readings were in the 80s across parts
of the middle and northern Atlantic Coast region and the upper Ohio
Valley.
   Cool weather prevailed across the rest of the nation east of the
Rockies, with readings mostly in the 60s and 70s. Temperatures in
the southwestern deserts were in the 90s or above 100 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Las Vegas, N.M., to 101 degrees at Thermal, Calif., and
Yuma, Ariz. The nation's low Sunday morning was 30 degrees in West
Yellowstone, Mont.
   Monday's forecast was for showers and thunderstorms from the
central Gulf Coast to New England. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms were expected in the Southeast, the southern Plains,
the southern Rockies and the southern Plateau region. A few showers
were predicted for the Pacific Northwest and the upper Great Lakes
region. Sunny skies were forecast across the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were expected to remain below 80 degrees from
New England across the Great Lakes region and the Ohio Valley into
the northern and central Plains, with afternoon highs in the 60s in
the Great Lakes region. Temperatures were expected to warm into the
lower 90s from south-central Texas to Florida and southern Georgia,
the 80s and lower 90s in the West, except upper 90s and above 100
degrees in the southwestern deserts and 70s along the Pacific Coast.

   The fragile Persian Gulf peace talks ran into
trouble Sunday after Iraq blamed Iran for sabotaging the
negotiations and said it was ready to confront any Iranian
aggression.
   Sunday's negotiations ended after six hours of talks with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar meeting separately with
representatives from both sides.
   The talks were at least temporarily downgraded from the
political level to a technical level.
   Foreign ministers Tariq Aziz of Iraq and Ali Akbar Velayati of
Iran withdrew earlier from the talks Sunday, the third day of
negotiations, but their delegations remained until the meetings
ended for the day.
   Perez de Cuellar told reporters he was trying to ``build
bridges'' and avert a breakdown.
   ``We cannot say now that we have reached a deadlock,'' he said
in response to questions. He said difficulties had arisen over
troop withdrawals and the possibility of deadlock always exists.
   ``I hope we will move back to the ministerial level as soon as
the disagreement is settled,'' he added.
   Iran will ``face from our side full preparedness to confront any
behavior of aggressive aspect,'' said a statement by Iraq's deputy
foreign minister, Sadoun Hamadi. The statement was released in
Baghdad and distributed here.
   Aziz left the U.N. offices after three hours of consultations
Sunday. Velayati departed an hour later.
   U.N. Spokesman Francois Giuliani said the negotiations were
expected to continue Monday at a lower, technical level. ``The
secretary-general thinks we are likely to be here for a long
time,'' he said.
   Aziz departed shortly after the hardline statement by Hamadi was
received from Baghdad. It declared Iraqi sovereignty over the
disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway and blamed Iran for continued
tension in the region.
   The peace talks, which began Thursday, resumed Sunday after a
``day of reflection'' as Iran accused Iraq of stalling and said the
negotiations ``could drag on for years.''
   The statement quoting Hamadi said Iran ``is placing obstacles
and pretexts ... in maneuvering, misguiding and gaining time which
give new evidence of its unseriousness ... and increase our
suspicions of the nature of its intentions in peace.''
   He reaffirmed Iraq's claim over the Shatt al-Arab, a major issue
in the talks. In 1980, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein tore up the
1975 treaty that had divided the waterway down the median line.
   ``Any attempt to minimize the full sovereignty of Iraq on this
vital lane would be faced with categorical rejection from our
side,'' Hamadi said.
   The dispute over the waterway is one of the factors that began
the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   Iran says the 1975 treaty still is valid and rejects Iraq's
claim to complete sovereignty.
   Hamadi said ``any procrastination exercised by the Iranian side
in this respect would harm the issue of peace.''
   He concluded by saying that any Iranian allegations and
aggression ``would face from our side rejection and full
preparedness to confront any behavior of aggressive aspect.''
   The Iraqi statement was delivered after the return of Iraqi
officials who had flown to Baghdad on Saturday for consultations
with their government about the troubled talks.
   The negotiations are aimed at consolidating a U.N.-supervised
cease-fire and working on a comprehensive peace.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Perez de
Cuellar suggested setting up an impartial committee to identify the
aggressor in the Iran-Iraq war and to release its findings by the
end of November.
   The report, monitored in Nicosia, was confirmed by Western
diplomats. Iran has insisted that Iraq be branded the aggressor.
Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after border skirmishes.
   IRNA said the three-man committee would be headed by a member of
the International Court of Justice in the Hague, the Netherlands.
Iran and Iraq each would send a liaison officer, it said.
   The talks between Velayati and Aziz are the first official
contact between the two sides since war broke out in September 1980.
   In Tehran Sunday, Iran's deputy foreign minister, Javad
Mansouri, accused Iraq of undermining negotiations by claiming
sovereignty over the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway.
   He also repeated Iran's demand for formation of an impartial
panel to determine which side started the war. Iran says Iraq must
be branded the aggressor before there can be lasting peace.
   ``Iraq continues to have designs on Iran's territorial
integrity,'' Mansouri was quoted as saying by IRNA.
   The United Nations approved a resolution calling for the end of
the Persian Gulf war in July 1987. Iraq endorsed the resolution
shortly after it was passed, but Iran refused to accept it until
July 18, after a series of battlefield setbacks.
   Perez de Cuellar has said he hopes to announce a timetable for
the withdrawal of troops, prisoner exchange and other elements of
the peace plan before Thursday, when he travels to Lisbon.

   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski on
Sunday called for national reconciliation and said top government
officials may be fired for failing to deal with the strongest wave
of strikes since 1981.
   But the two-day meeting of the Communist Party's Central
Committee ended without any immediate recommendations for changes
in Prime Minister Zbigniew Messner's government.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was slightly injured in a scuffle
with police. Troops blocked about 400 protesters trying to march on
the strikebound Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, where Walesa founded the
independent union federation in 1980.
   Talks ended a stubborn mine strike in the south, but 10 strikes
continued at ports, shipyards, factories and one mine. There were
no reports of police attempts to dislodge workers in occupation
strikes.
   Solidarity estimated about 8,500 people still were occupying
workplaces, striking for higher pay and legalization of Solidarity,
which was crushed with the imposition of martial law in 1981 and
outlawed in 1982.
   Jaruzelski, the Communist Party leader, severely criticized the
party's hand-picked government for failing to deal with building
economic and political tensions before they got out of control in
the strikes, which began Aug.16.
   He said the Central Committee would decide the fate of Messner's
government before Parliament meets in September. He also called for
for changes in the party leadership.
   Jaruzelski, whose closing speech was broadcast on television,
endorsed the idea of a discussion with representatives of striking
workers.
   ``We are invariably in favor of settling even the most difficult
questions by patience and dialogue. The hand remains
outstretched,'' he said. ``But there is no chance for an everything
or nothing attitude.''
   The government has not ruled out that such a forum might include
Walesa, who last held a high-level meeting with authorities in 1982
while interned after the imposition of martial law.
   At a news conference after the meeting, party spokesman Jerzy
Majka said Walesa was a possible candidate for such talks.
   The 230-member Central Committee endorsed continuing economic
and political reform with no ``halfway measures,'' but it condemned
``law-breaking and destruction,'' a reference to illegal strikes.
   Jaruzelski said the the government has a constant duty to keep
in touch with the population's feelings, and he criticized
officials for ``fanning out across the nation only after the fire
has started.''
   ``We are not used in the party to criticizing the government
from the rostrum of the Central Committee. That we have always done
in the family, silently,'' he said. ``Now we are finishing with
that practice.''
   But Jaruzelski's references to the opposition were milder.
   ``Our problems cannot be solved either by the weapon of strikes
or the means of coercion,'' he said. ``More than once in Polish
history, brother was pitted against brother. Time passed and then
they were standing side by side. It's about time that this road
prevails.
   ``There is no freedom without a sense of responsibility,'' he
said, echoing a favorite slogan of Solidarity: ``There is no
freedom without Solidarity.''
   Jaruzelski proposed transforming his ``consultative council''
into a ``council for national accord'' that presumably would seek
to forge areas of agreement between the government and opponents.
   Walesa left the Lenin shipyard Saturday to confer with advisers
about the possibility of talks with the government.
   When he tried to enter the cordoned-off shipyard Sunday morning,
a police officer tried to stop him, said a Walesa aide who spoke on
condition of anonymity. Walesa pulled away but lost a shoe and
scratched his hand when he climbed over the 7-foot fence into the
yard, the aide said.
   A Mass at the nearby St. Brygida's church drew about 10,000
worshipers who spilled into the square in front of the packed
church.
   ``From this place we have the right as free Poles to call for
freedom and the arrival of government authorities for roundtable
talks in the shipyard,'' the Rev. Henryk Jankowski, a Walesa
adviser, told worshipers.
   ``Let anyone who has a package of solutions for the current
situation sit at this table.''
   After the service, about 400 people tried to walk the five
blocks from the church to the shipyard entrance, but they were
blocked by massive lines of police in riot gear. The crowd
dispersed peacefully.
   The state-run PAP news agency said strikers decided to end the
10-day-old strike at the Jastrzebie mine in the southern town of
Jastrzebie at 6 p.m.
   The government and strikers earlier said talks were under way at
the mine, which was one of only two mines still on strike
nationwide, compared to 12 last week.
   Miners agreed to talk with management on local pay issues after
hearing rumors that Walesa would be speaking directly with the
government about legalizing Solidarity, said a strike spokeswoman
in Jastrzebie. Details on the tentative settlement were not
immediately available.

   Members of the Latvian community are coming
to the defense of a man who government officials allege was a
member of a pro-Nazi police unit during World War II.
   Federal prosecutors initiated deportation proceedings last
Monday against Edgars Inde, 79, a retired factory worker who lives
in Minneapolis.
   In the civil lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, authorities
allege that Inde belonged to the Latvian Auxiliary Police and
participated in killing unarmed Jews and other civilians during the
Nazi occupation of Latvia in 1941 and 1942. Latvia is now part of
the Soviet Union.
   ``He denies this, definitely,'' said the Rev. Modrus Gulbis of
Christ Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church in Minneapolis, who has
spoken with Inde. ``As of this moment, I am quite convinced he is
innocent, although I would definitely want to hear the other side
of the story.''
   The suit alleges that Inde hid his participation in war crimes
when he came to the United States in 1949 and applied for
naturalization. He became a U.S. citizen in 1955.
   When contacted Monday, Inde denied he killed Jews. ``No, no, no,
no, no, no,'' he said.
   His lawyer, Ivars Berzins of New York City, has refused comment.
   Inde is a well-liked member of the 2,000-member Latvian
community and is active in theater.
   ``I can tell you, with all my heart, this is hard to take, that
... people might think all Latvians are pro-Nazis,'' said the Rev.
Janis Rozentals, a retired theologian from Lutheran Northwestern
Seminary.
   Many Latvian-Americans believe the Justice Department's Office
of Special Investigations, which investigates Nazi war criminals
living in the United States, has been overzealous in its
investigations of Latvians and other Baltic peoples.
   ``It seems like in the last five years, that's been the case,''
said Ojars Kalnins, spokesman for the American Latvian Association
in Rockville, Md. ``It seems like the Balts are being singled out
because that's the kind of evidence that OSI is getting from the
Soviets.''
   OSI Director Neal Sher said although a number of current
investigations involve Americans of Baltic origin, he didn't know
what percentage they constitute of the 600 cases under
investigation.

   Divers searched for three missing sailors
Sunday after 21 others were removed from a sunken submarine on the
ocean floor in a dramatic day-long rescue operation.
   Officials said the captain of the submarine perished while
trying to save his men as the submarine sank Friday evening after
it was accidentally rammed by a Japanese tuna boat about three
miles off the port city of Callao.
   Three other crew members died and three are missing and presumed
dead, according to Peru's navy. It is believed the missing men are
inside water-filled compartments of the submarine.
   On Saturday, rescuers used a diving bell to remove 21 sailors
who had been trapped inside the vessel when it sank in about 96
feet of water.
   President Alan Garcia praised the ``heroic valor of the
officers'' aboard the submarine Pacocha, saying the captain and
others perished while attempting to save their fellow crewmen.
   He told reporters that the No. 8 Kyowa-Maru, a 412-ton fishing
boat with a steel hull, struck the stern of the former U.S. Navy
submarine, which flooded with water and quickly sank.
   As the vessel began sinking Friday night, about 24 crewmen were
plucked from the Pacific Ocean after donning life jackets and
jumping from the crippled submarine.
   The Pacocha's commander, Daniel Nieva, died while sealing a
hatch door of the submarine to save the men inside, Garcia said.
   There were no injuries aboard the tuna boat, which reached the
Callao port with cracks in its hull, the Japanese Embassy said. The
boat had a crew of 16 Japanese and five Peruvians.
   Callao officials have banned traffic in the port, Peru's largest
located eight miles west of Lima, until Monday to aid rescue
operations. Officials said an investigation into the cause of the
accident is being conducted.
   The men who were rescued Saturday had sealed themselves off in
dry compartments but their lives became endangered by cholorine gas
emitted when water flooded the vessel's batteries.
   The trapped sailors communicated with rescuers through sensors
attached by divers to the submarine's hull, said a navy spokesman,
Cmdr. Luis Castro.
   He said the accident occurred about three miles west of Callao
as the Pacocha was entering the port and the tuna boat departing.
   The Pacocha, purchased in 1974 from the United States, is one of
12 submarines in Peru's fleet, one of the largest in the Americas.
The 1,870-ton craft, formerly the U.S.S. Atule, was commissioned on
June, 21, 1944, according to Jane's Fighting Ships.
   Navy officials said the recovery equipment brought to Peru by a
U.S. team would be used to refloat the Pacocha.
   They said air is being pumped into the submarine in case the
three missing sailors are still alive. But Garcia and the officials
said it is believed the three are dead.

   Hooded Ku Klux Klansmen preaching white supremacy
staged a rally Sunday near a multiracial gathering commemorating
Martin Luther King Jr., as hundreds of club-carrying police tried
to keep the crowds under control.
   Fourteen people were arrested, most for disorderly conduct, in a
tense afternoon at Marquette Park, where similar rallies sparked
violence and resulted in 17 arrests two years ago.
   ``We had no idea that we'd both be here on the same day, but we
are damn proud to be here for the white race,'' an unidentified
klansman wearing a white hood told an all-white crowd of about 500.
Some members of the crowd held Nazi flags and wore ``White Power''
T-shirts.
   A line of uniformed policemen and wooden barriers kept the crowd
about 40 feet from the stage.
   About 900 police officers, some on horses and other carrying
clubs, filled the park and separated the KKK rally from the
multiracial group that gathered about a half-mile away for a later
rally.
   ``It might be legal to give (the KKK) a permit to spread hatred
and violence, but it's immoral,'' said Dee D. Smith Simmons, an
organizer of the Dream Day Quest, commemorating the 25th
anniversary of King's famous ``I Have A Dream'' speech.
   Mounted police blocked a crowd of several hundred Klan
sympathizers, some shouting ``White Power,'' who tried to break
away from the rally and march to the gathering of about 200 blacks,
whites and Hispanics.
   Three whites, including a woman wearing a T-shirt with the
``White Power'' slogan, were taken away in police wagons, but
officers refused to say why.
   About 150 police officers surrounded a separate multiracial
crowd of about 300 who marched from a nearby church to attend the
King rally, which continued after the Klansmen began dispersing.
Officers fended off several hundred Klan sympathizers who tried to
taunt the marchers.
   ``I'm thankful that the police are here but (the Klan members)
are the ones who are frightened. ... I feel some pity and a lot of
irritation,'' said Rosetta Martin, a white woman from suburban
Hazel Crest.
   ``We organized this to demonstrate to all of Chicago that the
days of racial division are over,'' the Rev. B. Herbert Martin, the
city's commissioner of human relations, said at the King rally.
   In 1966, King led a protest march into Marquette Park, where he
was greeted by a crowd of whites throwing stones.
   Ten years ago, a neo-Nazi group threatened to march through
suburban Skokie, whose 69,000 residents include 23,000 Jews. That
march was called off after lawsuits and community pressure.

   Gangs of youths threw bombs and
hijacked trucks in west Belfast for a second night Sunday after a
convicted IRA guerrilla was extradited from the Irish Republic.
   At least 16 people were wounded in the rash of shootings,
bombings and other attacks that police blamed on the Irish
Republican Army. Police said there were no serious injuries.
   Violence was reported throughout Northern Ireland after Robert
Russell, a convicted IRA guerrilla, was extradited to Northern
Ireland to complete a prison term for attempted murder and to face
new charges of prison escape.
   In the neighboring Irish Republic, three police officers were
hurt Saturday during a clash as a convoy crossed into Northern
Ireland.
   Since Saturday, there were 193 attacks on police units, 23
shooting incidents, 17 bombings and 56 hijackings of cars, vans and
buses, police said. Some vehicles were set afire, blown up or left
with bombs that were defused by security forces.
   They said 11 police officers, one soldier and four civilians
were wounded in the two days of violence. Bombings were reported in
Belfast, Newry and Londonderry.
   On Sunday, a bomb was thrown at a police station in mainly
Catholic west Belfast, several vehicles were hijacked, and many
gasoline bombs were thrown at police, said a spokesman for the
Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force. However, he
said no injuries were reported in those incidents.
   Earlier Sunday, a calf grazing on a military shooting range was
killed when it set off a bomb apparently meant for locally
recruited soldiers who train there.
   Police said the calf probably triggered the bomb by stepping on
a pressure plate or tripwire on a footpath used by soldiers at the
range at Portballintrae in County Antrim on Northern Ireland's
north coast.
   Chief Inspector Ian Williamson, responsible for policing the
Falls Road area of west Belfast, told the British Broadcasting
Corp. that the violence was planned by the IRA and its legal
political wing, Sinn Fein.
   ``They may claim or give the impression that Russell was the
reason, but it was just the excuse. This day would have come
regardless of whatever reason they dreamed up for it,'' Williamson
said.
   The predominantly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army is
fighting to unite Northern Ireland with the overwhelmingly Catholic
Irish Republic.
   Bombs began exploding hours after Russell was extradited to
Northern Ireland.
   Hundreds of IRA supporters clashed with police in Dublin and the
border village of Carrickarnon early Saturday to protest Russell's
extradition, police and witnesses said.
   In Dublin, about 80 supporters who had staged an all-night vigil
in front of Mountjoy prison attacked police with bottles and tried
to knock them off motorcycles as they prepared to transport Russell
50 miles to the border.
   Other demonstrators lay in the road to try to block the convoy
and more violence flared when police began dragging them away.
   Russell, 30, escaped from Northern Ireland's Maze Prison in a
mass breakout by IRA inmates in September 1983. He fled to Ireland
and was arrested in Dublin in 1984. The last legal bid to stop his
extradition failed in the High Court in Dublin on Friday.
   Several hundred demonstrators waited in heavy rain for Russell's
convoy at Carrickarnon inside the Irish Republic on the road
between Dublin and Belfast, Irish police said.
   Before the convoy arrived, they attacked police with stones,
bottles and fists. Chief Superintendent John Nolan of the Garda
Siochana, Ireland's police force, said three officers were hurt in
the fighting.
   Some protesters sat in the road to form a human barricade
against the police van carrying Russell, but the van avoided them
by veering off the road and speeding across a field.
   Police said Russell was handed over to Northern Ireland police,
put in a helicopter and flown 30 miles to Lisburn near Belfast.
After a brief court appearance he was returned to the top-security
Maze Prison.

   Here are some quotes from political figures
Sunday:
   
   DAN QUAYLE, the Republican vice presidential nominee, in an
interview with The Associated Press: ``I will eventually be an
asset to the ticket. I feel that I have a lot to offer in
leadership. I feel I have a lot to offer in the area of national
defense. I feel that I have worked very hard in the area of arms
control.''
   
   LLOYD BENTSEN, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, on
Quayle's qualifications: ``Now, I wouldn't say that he couldn't
grow into the job; he probably could. But if a tragedy befell a
president, you'd have to be able to move in immediately and take
over and do what has to be done in facing whatever issues that
confront you at that time.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, the Republican presidential nominee, on his showing
in the polls: ``I think it's very encouraging movement in the
polls, but these things change so dramatically. ... I can't deny
it's encouraging, but there's certainly nothing there that makes me
relax.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, on efforts by Democrats to recapture those who
voted for Reagan: ``Well, I would think that the Democrats'
strength is not between the 45-yard lines. ... It will be the
unregistered voters who need to be inspired.''

   Firefighters torched more
than 500 acres of timber Sunday to make a dramatic goal-line stand
against the leading edge of the largest and perhaps most stubborn
of the blazes in and around Yellowstone National Park.
   ``This fire has kicked us for months. Now we're going to kick it
back,'' Forest Service fire information office Pat Kaunert said.
``We've got to sacrifice this in order to save the timber base and
these towns. This is where we make a stand.''
   Seven bulldozers cleared a six-mile, 70-foot-wide ``freeway''
through the pines Saturday and Sunday before the huge ``backfire''
was set. A ``hot shot'' crew of 19 used drip torches loaded with
diesel fuel and gasoline to torch the acreage between the safety
swath and the 182,000-acre Clover Mist blaze, which has moved to
within a few miles of U.S. Highway 212 which skirts the
Wyoming-Montano border and the communities of Crandall, Wyo., and
Cooke City, Mont.
   Flames rose 100 feet into the air and dense smoke billowed over
the valley as the new fire burned back toward the most aggressive
edge of Clover Mist. About 200 firefighters stood guard at the edge
of the blaze, armed with shovels and fire hoses.
   The Forest Service, eager for its first victory against the
fire, had to wait until late afternoon for proper conditions.
Helicopters and airplanes loaded with water and fire retardant
stood by in case the wind shifted and blew flames back at the
firefighters.
   ``This is the moment we've been waiting for,'' Kaunert said.
``If the fire gets over (Highway) 212, we'd be in a very bad
position to defend the towns.''
   The backfire was indicative of the progress frustrated
firefighters have made against blazes in the last two days. Calm,
favorable winds and cool temperatures at night have slowed the
ravaging flames.
   Earlier, erratic winds kept forcing firefighters to retreat as
Clover Mist moved out of Yellowstone and closer to towns along the
Wyoming-Montana border. And the forecast included more potential
trouble in the form of a new weather system approaching, perhaps as
early as Tuesday, that could bring a change in wind direction and
strong gusts.
   Clover Mist is one of five forest fires burning in Yellowstone
and surrounding forests. Shonsone National Forest borders
Yellowstone's eastern edge.
   Until Sunday, mountainous terrain had kept forest service crews
from mounting a massive assault against Clover Mist.
   ``We had to wait until it got to where we could get at it,''
Kaunert said.
   For more than a week smoke and occasional flames climbing over
the mountains protecting Cooke City had troubled townspeople, who
were told Friday to prepare for an evacuation that was never
necessary. Three Crandall-area ranches were evacuated Saturday.
   In addition to the towns, the fire also threatened some of the
most productive timber land in the Clarks Fork Ranger District.
   ``It's very valuable timber as far as the local economy goes,''
said Forest Service District Ranger Randy Herzberg.
   Enough timber is harvested annually out of the threatened area
to build 100 homes, Herzberg said

   A young medical assistant trembled
and sobbed as she thought of the festive air show that turned into
a fiery tragedy.
   ``There are many children among the dead and injured,'' said
Kris Kumpf, who treated some of the victims.
   ``And the worst part of it is, we're still trying to find some
of the parents.''
   The accident occurred at the U.S. Air Base in Ramstein when a
maneuver by an Italian acrobatic jet team went wrong and sent one
of the aircraft into a crowd of screaming spectators. Two others
crashed, and authorities put the death toll at 46.
   Miss Kumpf said most of the injured had badly burned backs from
when tey turned and tried to run away from the flaming jet.
   After speaking to reporters, Miss Kumpf called her mother to
tell her not to worry.
   ``I'm okay, mama. But there are too many dead,'' she tearfully
said over the telephone.
   Krista Banks, a middle-age West German who works as a waitress
at the U.S. Air Force base at Ramstein, saw the disaster from the
base's control tower.
   ``It was horrible, horrible, a huge shock,'' said Mrs. Banks,
who is married to an American who works for the U.S. Army in the
Kaiserslautern area.
   ``It's going to take a long time to forget this.''
   ``There was a big flash of flame and smoke, and people were
running away. Everyone at the tower was in shock,'' said Mrs. Banks.
   Hundreds of people were walking back to their cars parked
outside the base after the accident. Many of them looked stunned.
Few of them were speaking.
   An old woman cried as a younger woman comforted her and led her
toward their car.
   An elderly West German man said that the accident occurred when
two groups of Italian jets were performing a maneuver just above
the airfield.
   ``Five of the planes came from one direction, and four came head
on in another. A single plane came from yet another direction, and
there was a crash.
   ``All I saw was a big ball of fire,'' said the man, who would
not give his name.
   Hours after the crash, the airfield where the accident occurred
was scattered with paper cups, beer cases, and turned-over lawn
chairs left by fleeing spectators.
   A huge block of scorched debris from one of the three airplanes
involved in the crash lay next to a destroyed truck that caught
fire when it was rammed by the aircraft.
   A smoky stench still clotted the air.
   U.S. Air Force guards escorted reporters who visited the scene
of the disaster, but refused to say anything.
   Traffic was backed up outside the base as ambulances rushed
casualties from the scene to hospitals in the area.
   Mrs. Banks praised emergency rescue efforts during the initial
moments of the tragedy.
   ``Rescue ambulances were very quickly on the way to the scene,''
she said.
   West Germany's ARD television network showed horrifying footage
of Sunday's crash at the Ramstein U.S. Air Base, including the
plane veering out of control already in flames and the spectators'
area looking like a battlefield afterwards.
   The disaster began as the Italian Air Force ``air acrobatic
team'' flew at about 60 meters off the ground in front of a crowd
estimated by Germans to be more than 200,000. Most are Germans and
Americans.
   Suddenly, planes collided in formation, small pieces were seen
flying from the aircraft. A crippled plane veered uncontrollably
out of formation, with flames already coming from the fuselage.
   Spectators looked up to see the plane heading straight toward
them, with many starting to run in panic.
   The Italian Aermacchi MB 339A plowed into a row of cars and
buses, bursting into a ball of flames at least 100 feet high and
wide.
   ``We saw the fireball racing toward us, so we first threw
ourselves down on the ground,'' said Detlef Hosser, an ARD
cameraman.
   Both West German and American rescue squads arrived on the
scene. Helicopters hovered overhead. Rescue workers carried off
some of the dead on stretchers.
   Desperate parents, meanwhile, cried out for missing children.

   The Italian air force stunt team whose performance
went tragically awry in West Germany on Sunday has had other
encounters with disaster.
   The latest tragedy was the worst, however. Three pilots of the
famed troupe died Sunday when their sleek fighter jets collided
during a huge air show at the Ramstein U.S. Air Base.
   One of the aircraft plunged into the crowd, and authorities said
at least 46 people overall were killed.
   The three jets were part of a 10-plane Italian Air Force
demonstration team, ``Frecce Tricolori,'' that was flying 65 yards
above the ground.
   The Frecce Tricolori, which means Tri-Color Arrows and refers to
the three-colored Italian flag, was founded in 1930 as a school of
aerobatics. Since 1956, it has been a separate unit of the Italian
air force based at Rivolto.
   Three times before in the last 10 years have members of the
precision team been killed in air crashes. One, Capt. Pier Gianni
Petri, was credited with saving the lives of spectators at a May
29, 1979, air show at Mildehall in Britain by directing his G91 jet
away from the crowd when it crashed.
   Two of the unit's G91 jets collided over the airport at Rivolto
on July 12, 1978, killing one of the two pilots, Capt. Graziano
Carrer. On Sept. 2, 1981, another G91 crashed at Rivolto, killing
Capt. Antonio Gallus.
   The three pilots killed in the collision Sunday at Ramstein were
Lt. Col. Mario Naldini, 41, Lt. Col. Ivo Nutarelli, 38, and Capt.
Giorgio Alessio, 31. Italian Air Force officials said Naldini had
3,900 flight hours, Nutarelli had 3,800 and Alessio had 1,600.
   The men were flying Aermacchi MB 339As, a two-seat attack
aircraft that the Italian air force also uses for pilot training.
   The Frecce Tricolori includes 14 pilots, three technical
officers and 55 specialists.
   Aircraft used by Frecce Tricolori are painted blue with
longitudinal stripes of red, white and green, the colors of the
Italian flag which is known in Italy as the tricolori.
   To be a member of the team, a pilot must have at least six years
of experience and a minimum of 1,000 hours of flight time. Military
officials say that the team members actually have an average of
3,000 flight hours and an average age of 32.
   The team appears at numerous shows in Italy and abroad between
April and October each year and spends the intervening months
practicing its aerobatic routines.
   During a show there are normally nine planes in formation, one
soloist and the commander remains on the field coordinating the
action by radio.

   ``Krushed Kitties'' may head the list of this
year's novelty Christmas gift items, judging from the reaction of
retailers Sunday at the Miami Gift Show.
   The kitties look just like their name: a cat's bottom, back legs
and tail, perfect for sticking out of car hoods, trunks and doors.
Wholesaler Bill Nilian says gift-shop buyers are snapping them up
so quickly he can't keep them in stock.
   ``Everybody feels they need one of those,'' Nilian said.
   The 750 wholesalers and 7,000 specialty store representatives
attending the four-day show apparently consider Disney's animated
movie star Roger Rabbit too passe to generate much interest come
Christmas morning.
   Instead, the retailers were snapping up ``alien balls'' that
light in your hand, floppy stuffed pets called Googles and talking
footballs.
   The popularity of Googles proves that sick humor won't be the
only path to the pocketbook in the holiday novelty market.
Manufacturer Ann Peseri went to the show to plug her own product
but walked away with $300 worth of Googles. She says she loves the
furry platypuses and dogs that can be wrapped around the neck
because ``they hug you back.''

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen said Sunday that Sen. Dan Quayle probably
could grow into the job of being president if it became necessary,
while Quayle said he's ready for a debate with Bentsen to show
voters who's qualified.
   Bentsen's remarks were the faintest of praise from a 67-year-old
Texas Democrat seeking to contrast his experience with that of a
41-year-old Indiana Republican _ and to make the difference a major
issue in their campaign for vice president.
   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet The Press,'' Bentsen was asked whether
Quayle was qualified to be president.
   ``Frankly, he would not have been on my short list as I look
over my Senate colleagues,'' said Bentsen. ``He obviously was on
the short list of the hard right. ...
   ``Now, I wouldn't say that he couldn't grow into the job; he
probably could. But if a tragedy befell a president, you'd have to
be able to move in immediately and take over and do what has to be
done in facing whatever issues that confront you at that time.''
   Quayle, in an in-flight interview Sunday with The Associated
Press, said he has no quarrel with his Senate colleague Bentsen. In
fact, Quayle focused during his seven-state campaign swing on
Dukakis, saying a victory by the Massachusetts governor would be a
disaster for the country.
   ``I've served with Sen. Bentsen for almost eight years. He is
not the issue,'' Quayle said. ``The issue is Michael Dukakis.
Michael Dukakis' view of America is a much different view than
George Bush's. Michael Dukakis' approach to national defense, his
approach to the economy, his approach to child care _ all of those
approaches are much different than George Bush's.''
   Quayle also said he is not disturbed by polls that show a
majority of the public views Bentsen as more qualified for the vice
presidential spot, and to be president if it comes to that.
   ``The American people are just beginning to see Dan Quayle,'' he
said. ``I'm going to continue to talk about the issues. When we
have the debate between Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle, the American
people will have a lot better picture of who will be the best
qualified vice presidential candidate.''
   Quayle attended church in Sacramento, Calif., and then made the
cross-country flight home to Washington for a couple of days of
rest and planning for this week's swing through Louisiana,
Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.
   The contenders for the No. 1 chair in the Oval Office _
Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis _ were out and
about, but keeping things low-key.
   Bush attended services at the Episcopal church near the Houston
hotel where he maintains an official address, then took in an
Astros baseball game. Later he attended a memorial service in
Austin for former Texas Gov. Price Daniel.
   During an in-flight interview, Bush commented on his recent
boost in the polls, saying: ``I think it's very encouraging
movement in the polls, but these things change so dramatically. ...
I can't deny it's encouraging, but there's certainly nothing there
that makes me relax.''
   Dukakis went to church and then attended a Sunday afternoon
concert. He planned to spend the next two days in Massachusetts
attending to gubernatorial duties.
   But if Bentsen was the only candidate taking a highly visible
stance Sunday, he was not the only political figure doing do.
   Jesse Jackson assured another group of television interviewers _
on ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley'' _ that he was behind the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket, but left it a little fuzzy to what extent.
   To a questioner's suggestion that he had not quite made up his
mind on how hard to play the game, Jackson said:
   ``Well, I've made up my mind, but of course, I need signals of
sensitivity that reflect the urgency of now. We must keep expanding
beyond the present Democratic base with an intense voter
registration campaign that has not yet been agreed upon and
planned. There must be more inclusion at the senior policy
positions in order that there might be more sensitivity around
Governor Dukakis.''
   Jackson said it was fine for the Democratic ticket to reach out
to middle-of-the road Democrats who have been voting for Ronald
Reagan.
   At the same time, he said, ``I would think the Democrats'
strength is not between the 45-yard lines ... this obsession to
recall Reagan Democrats who are with Quayle under the Bush.''
   Later, Jackson said, ``My concern is that if we're going to win,
it will be by the margin of our enthusiasm of our expanded
participation. Therefore my emphasis, the way I'm helping the
ticket at this point, is engaging in massive registration.''
   Bentsen's remarks about Quayle's experience were a continuation
of the Democratic strategy of calling attention to the better-known
Texas senator's 17{ years in the Senate compared to Quayle's
7{-year tenure.
   Asked about the flap over Quayle's membership in the Indiana
National Guard during the Vietnam War, Bentsen noted that all
candidates for national office are subject to intense media
scrutiny.
   ``I think that has now been done insofar as Senator Quayle and
his decision to go into the Guard and what motivated him and how he
was able to enter that Guard,'' he said. ``And now I think we
should move on to other issues.''
   Bentsen acknowledged that he has differences with Dukakis on a
variety of issues, but insisted that was a plus for the Democratic
ticket.
   ``I think what you're seeing is a situation where Michael
Dukakis was not looking for a clone of himself,'' he said. ``He was
reaching out to the center. It shows something of the integrity of
this man, that he is not afraid to listen to a different
viewpoint.''

   Search teams recovered the bodies of 35
more victims of the Aug. 21 earthquake in the mountainous region
between Nepal and India, raising the disaster's death toll to
nearly 1,000, officials said Sunday.
   Nepal's Home Ministry said officials have confirmed the deaths
of 708 people in Nepal from the Aug. 21 quake, 35 above its
previous count. India has reported 277 Indians perished, making the
death toll 985 for both countries.
   The Home Ministry also said 1,551 Nepalese were injured and 171
people in serious condition were flown by helicopters from the
remote region to hospitals in Biratnagar, 140 miles southeast of
Katmandu.
   Heavy weekend rains blocked the medical evacuation Sunday and
also caused landslides and flooding that claimed at least 12 more
lives, according to the Nepalese news agency RSS. It said five
people were missing.
   RSS said 12 people were killed by landslides in villages some
200 miles west of Katmandu.
   Five people were carried away by surging waters of the flooding
Narayani River 75 miles southwest of the capital, according to the
agency.
   The quake, which measured 6.5 on the Richter scale, destroyed or
damaged 17,875 houses in 24 districts in Nepal.
   More than 10,000 Nepalese were killed in a major quake in 1934.
   The Richter scale measures energy released by an earthquake as
recorded on seismographs, and each increase by one number means the
ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake measuring 6 can cause
severe damage and one registering 7 is considered a major quake.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino left Monday
for a three-day visit to Brunei and troops in Manila were ordered
on full alert to guard against any attempted coup during her
absence.
   At least 16 people were killed in scattered actions Sunday. A
police captain was shot Sunday in a Manila suburb and 15 people
were killed in fighting between guerrillas of the communists' New
People's Army and anti-communist vigilantes on the central island
of Negros.
   ``We have assured the president that she can make her trip to
Brunei .... and she can come back here and find the country safe
and secure,'' Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told reporters Sunday.
   Troops have been placed on alert during Mrs. Aquino's previous
foreign trips but there have been no coup attempts while she was
abroad.
   She has visited Singapore, Indonesia, the United States, Japan,
China, Hong Kong, Switzerland and Italy since becoming president in
February 1986 after the civilian-military uprising that toppled
President Ferdinand Marcos. He is now living in exile in Hawaii.
   Mrs. Aquino, leader of one of Southeast Asia's poorest nations,
is to hold talks with Brunei's ruler, Sultan Hassanal Bokiah, one
of the world's richest men.
   She said in a brief departure statement her visit is to improve
relations with a fellow member of the seven-country Association of
Southeast Asian Nations. She also will meet with Brunei businessmen
to encourage investments in the Philippines.
   Officials gave these accounts of the killings Sunday;
   Four gunmen killed Capt. Roberto Basco, the anti-narcotics
commander in Lucena City, as he and his family left a Roman
Catholic church in Pasig. Basco's wife and 18-year-old daughter
were wounded in the attack.
   Communist rebels have killed scores of policemen and soldiers
this year but police said Basco may have been slain by common
criminals.
   On Negros island, anti-communist vigilantes killed a suspected
guerrilla and in a reprisal raid about 100 communist rebels killed
nine of the vigilantes. Luisito Pedro, a vigilantes leader, said
his men killed five guerrillas in the fighting.
   On Sunday, Mrs. Aquino praised soldiers killed defending her
government during a coup attempt last year.
   Speaking at the military cemetery at Fort Bonifacio on the
anniversay of the attempted Coup on Aug. 28, 1987, she said:
   ``They fell on this day last year in the greatest battle waged
to defend our newly restored democracy.''
   At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 wounded when
mutinous soldiers led by former Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan tried to
storm the presidential palace.
   Honasan was captured last December but escaped in April and
remains at large.
   Mrs. Aquino made no mention Sunday of opposition moves to forge
a new alliance.
   Vice President Salvador Laurel announced on Saturday the
formation of the Union for National Action alliance.
   Laurel said Mrs. Aquino's ``blundering and immoral
administration'' would lead the country to disaster.
   Last September Laurel resigned as foreign secretary.

   No one won Florida's $32 million Lotto
jackpot, pushing the grand prize in the weekly numbers game to at
least $50 million, only $1.4 million short of the nation's record
lottery prize.
   Lottery officials estimate each week's jackpot based on
projected sales.
   But Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said Sunday she didn't know
if ticket sales would surpass expectations this week and push the
jackpot past the national record. ``We don't know what's going to
happen,'' she said.
   The size of the prize should give Florida's lottery national
exposure that will help attract tourists to the months-old game,
Mrs. Paul said.
   ``That is really, really good for the state of Florida,'' she
said.
   The national record for a lottery prize was set in June when
California gave away $51.4 million to two winners.
   In the Florida Lotto game, players try to match six numbers from
one through 49. Tickets are $1.
   No one matched the six winning numbers drawn Saturday _ 20, 42,
6, 29, 45 and 26.
   The prizes are rolled over into the next week's purse, fueling
sales as they get bigger. The Florida jackpot increases quickly,
compared with other states, partly because the state set up its
lottery with some of the toughest odds of any lottery in the nation
_ nearly 14 million to 1 against winning.
   Florida joined 27 states and the District of Columbia that have
legalized lotteries when the Lotto game started in April.
   Three drawings have now passed without a grand prize winner.
Emily Davidheiser of Brandon claimed the $26 million prize from the
Aug. 6 drawing.
   More than 32 million Lotto tickets were sold this last week,
according to Mrs. Paul.

   An oil pipeline exploded in eastern Veracruz
state, killing at least 11 people and injuring several others, the
government oil monopoly Pemex said Sunday.
   The explosion occurred at 5:00 a.m. Sunday (7:00 a.m. EDT),
roughly five hours after a leak from the 30-inch pipeline was
discovered, Pemex said in a statement.
   Workers had succeeded in shutting off the flow of oil when the
leak caught fire and the pipeline exploded, Pemex said. The blaze
was brought under control at 6:40 a.m. (8:40 a.m. EDT).
   Company officials were investigating the cause of the explosion,
Pemex said. Pemex did not release the victims' identities and did
not say how many were injured in the explosion.
   The incident occurred between the towns of Juan Diaz Covarrubias
and Juan R. Cabada on the Poza Rica-Nuevo Teapa pipeline, about 270
miles km) east of Mexico City.
   Pemex director Francisco Rojas ordered an investigation into the
incident, the statement said.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second day of calm
weather Sunday in Yellowstone National Park put firefighters ahead
in their war against forest fires and temperatures almost down to
freezing slowed flames in Montana.
   ``Basically, things are pretty calm because the weather is
giving us a break,'' said fire information officer Sue Consolo in
Montana.
   Fires also continued burning in forests and grassland in Idaho,
Oregon, Washington and Utah.
   Yellowstone officials said the fires that had charred about
450,000 acres of the park had grown little from Saturday.
   Park officials decided to close the elegant Lake Hotel nearly a
month early because of a dramatic drop in the number of tourists
visiting Yellowstone. Some other hotels remained open.
   The Wolf Lake blaze, about five miles west of the world-famous
Old Faithful geyser, remained stable overnight, said park
spokeswoman Marsha Karle. That fire is the northeastern end of the
85,400-acre North Fork fire.
   Other fires in the park included the 182,100-acre Clover-Mist
fire in the northeast and the 92,315-acre Snake Complex south of
the North Fork fire. Just south of the park in the Bridger-Teton
National Forest, the Huck fire held at 30,500 acres.
   Just a week ago, 1,200 soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., were
sent to help firefighters outside the park. Now 550 soldiers, also
from Fort Lewis, have been deployed in Yellowstone to help on the
North Fork fire, which has been burning since July 23.
   ``They said `don't be surprised if you're out here the whole
month of September,''' said Pfc. Mark Philipps.
   The Forest Service also announced it would begin hiring 4,000
temporary firefighters in Western states on Monday through state
Job Service offices.
   Temperatures dipped as low as 30 degrees at West Yellowstone,
Mont., at the park's west entrance early Sunday, and no significant
wind was expected during the day.
   In south-central Montana, the Hellroaring Creek fire expanded
overnight by 1,100 acres, to 34,200 acres, but firefighters were
optimistic because of light wind.
   The nearby Storm Creek fire that briefly threatened two towns
last week was relatively calm, said Consolo, the fire information
officer.
   Despite inadequate manpower and equipment because of fires
elsewhere, firefighters nearly contained most of Oregon's fires
Sunday, easing the threat to a 1,000-resident subdivision near
Grants Pass and a remote village, officials said. Nearly 45,000
acres of timber and grass have burned since a series of fires was
sparked by lightning Tuesday.
   ``We feel pretty good today _ things have progressed pretty
well,'' said Ron DeHart, spokesman for the Washington-Oregon
Multiagency Coordination Center in Portland. ``We just hope the
weather doesn't bring us some more storms and lightning.''
   One firefighter got a scare when a bear chased him up a
smoldering tree Saturday in southern Oregon, Mike Barsotti, a state
forestry spokesman. The man climbed so close to burning branches
that his boots were burned, he said.
   ``When they finally got him down, he was shaken enough that they
were afraid to take him in, so they called for an ambulance,''
Barsotti said. ``But he's all right now.''
   Forest fires in Idaho have charred a total of 56,940 acres, and
fires continued to burn out of control Sunday in the Payette, Nez
Perce, Boise, Challis, Clearwater, Salmon, Caribou and Idaho
Panhandle national forests, and in the Selway-Bitterroot and Frank
Church River Of No Return wilderness areas, said Sandra Alley, fire
information officer at the Boise Interagency Fire Center.
   About 1,750 people were fighting six major groups of fires that
have blackened nearly 16,000 acres in Washington, said DeHart.
   The weather service said a weather front should move across
Washington from the Pacific on Monday, bringing cooler temperatures
statewide and a chance of drizzle in some westside locations.
   Utah firefighters aided by cooler temperatures closed in on a
505-acre fire near Pineview Reservoir in northern Utah, and only
mop-up remained on a blaze in the Ashley National Forest in eastern
Utah, fire officials said.

   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski on
Sunday called for national reconciliation and said top government
officials may be fired for failing to deal with the strongest wave
of strikes since 1981.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was slightly injured in a scuffle
with police. Troops blocked about 400 protesters trying to march on
the strikebound Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, where Walesa founded the
independent union federation in 1980.
   Talks ended a stubborn mine strike in the south, but 10 strikes
continued at ports, shipyards, factories and one mine. There were
no reports of police attempts to dislodge workers in occupation
strikes.

   Soviet bloc agents may have had
access to NATO defense secrets at a U.S. Army base for decades
before a former U.S. sergeant was charged with spying there, a West
German newspaper said Sunday.
   West Germany last week announced the arrest of former U.S. Army
Sgt. Clyde Lee Conrad, who since the late 1970s allegedly sold
classified information from the Army base in Bad Kreuznach.
   Officials said Conrad, 41, revealed secrets about nuclear
missile bases, pipeline systems and troop strength to Hungarian
agents, who passed them on to the Kremlin and other Soviet bloc
countries.
   But the spy ring may have been receiving NATO information long
before Conrad became active, according to the Welt am Sonntag
newspaper, which quoted information from unidentified U.S.
investigators.
   Conrad was in charge of safekeeping classified NATO documents,
which were held in a safe at the Bad Kreuznach base. The newspaper
said U.S. security officers believe Conrad's predecessor at the
base documentation center also worked for the Hungarian secret
service.

   The fragile Persian Gulf peace talks ran into
trouble Sunday after Iraq blamed Iran for sabotaging the
negotiations and said Baghdad was ready to confront any aggression
from Tehran.
   Iran will ``face from our side full preparedness to confront any
behavior of aggressive aspect,'' said a statement by Iraqi Foreign
Minister Sadoun Hamadi, released in Baghdad and distributed here.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz abruptly walked out of the
U.N. offices after three hours of separate consultations between
U.N. officials between Aziz and his counterpart, Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati.
   Aziz departed shortly after the hardline statement by Hamadi was
received from Baghdad. It declared Iraqi sovereignty over the
disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway and blamed Iran for continued
tension in the region.
   It was not clear if the talks were at an impasse, but the
problems appeared to be very grave.

   Executions are down this year, even in
the nation's capital punishment capital, as courts ``fine-tune''
the laws and death-row inmates wait to see what effect that will
have on their cases.
   In Texas this year, only Robert Streetman has been belted to the
gurney and executed by injection, while eight convicts have been
put to death nationally. Last year, Texas accounted for six of the
25 U.S. executions and 10 of 18 in 1986.
   Since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the death penalty legal in
1976, 101 inmates have been put to death, 27 of them in the Lone
Star State.
   Nationwide in the last year, many court opinions in death
penalty cases went against the states, Walt said.
   ``There seems to be a little bit of fine-tuning in state
statutes,'' he said.

   About 40 percent of women who separated recently
while in their 30s will never remarry, nor will about 70 percent of
women who separated when older than 40, a new study projects.
   And while 72 percent of recently separated women will eventually
go to the altar again, half will still be single seven years after
the split, the projections suggest.
   The estimates, for women who separated in the early 1980s,
emphasize that separation can mean long periods of single life and
economic hardship for some women and their children, researchers
said.
   Bumpass, a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin in
Madison, developed the projections with colleagues James Sweet and
Teresa Castro. He spoke in a telephone interview before presenting
the study Sunday in Atlanta at the annual meeting of the American

   Africanized ``killer bees'' are
spreading north and will arrive in the United States in less than
two years despite efforts to stop them or alter their behavior,
officials say.
   The bees killed one resident of Tapachula, a town near the
Guatemalan border, when a man tripped on an unseen hive. They also
have harassed herds of cattle and made grazing difficult as far as
650 feet from a hive.
   The Africanized bees are descendants of African bees that
escaped during an experiment in Brazil. They mate with local bees,
spawning new generations that are more aggressive and dangerous to
handle, make less honey and pollinate crops less efficiently.

that a 15-inch General radial tire was the longest lasting in
government mileage tests.
   Topping a list prepared by the Center for Auto Safety was the
General 15-inch Ameri Classic, with a tread wear rating of 350 _
meaning it should get 70,000 miles of use under average driving

   A month after the Windy City snuffed out smoking
in public places, sending smokers huffing to puff outside or in
designated areas, officials in the nation's third-largest city say
the ban is a success.
   ``If complaints are an efficient barometer of what's going on,
then the law is working,'' said Patrick Lenihan, deputy
commissioner for planning in the Department of Health. ``We haven't
heard too much about it.''
   But some restaurant operators say the ordinance, which forces
eateries to guarantee patrons a non-smoking area, has created
problems.
   The law, which bans smoking in restaurants, stores, businesses,
airports, bus terminals, subway stations and taxis, took effect
July 25.
   But the City Council passed the ordinance without setting up a
mechanism to enforce the law, which calls for $25 to $100 fines,
and no one has been cited for violations.

   The man who designed the roller coaster

permission to work on it and has never ridden his creation. His
doctor won't let him.

work on it if I didn't get too excited about anything.''
   Rated best in the nation by American Coaster Enthusiasts when it
opened five years ago, the Cyclone is still the favorite of many
coaster buffs, although it is neither the largest nor the fastest.
   What it lacks in height and speed, it makes up for in
bone-jarring turns, says Paul L. Ruben, editor of RollerCoaster!,
the official magazine of ACE, a non-profit group of 1,700 coaster

<TEXT>
   Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga says a free
trade agreement between his country and the United States is being
considered more seriously because recent successes in resolving
trade disputes have improved relations between the two nations.
   It is time to ``build our partnership on the basis of our
interlocking strengths instead of constantly warring over our
separate weaknesses,'' Matsunaga told the Washington Council on
International Trade last week.
   The ambassador said that the much-discussed U.S. trade deficit
and the corresponding Japanese trade surplus ``simply do not
comprehend'' the scope and complexity of the economic and political
relationships between the two countries.
   ``It is quite understandable, therefore, that thoughtful people
on both sides of the Pacific are now considering the possible
benefits of some form of free trade arrangement between the United
States and Japan, the two largest and most dynamic economies in the
world, whose two-way trade is exceeded in value only by America's
trade with Canada...'' Matsunaga said in his Thursday address.
   A U.S.-Japan free trade agreement _ which essentially would
remove trade barriers between the two nations _ was proposed first
in 1981 by Mike Mansfield, U.S. ambassador to Japan. The initial
reaction was widespread skepticism that two countries with such
different cultures and legal systems could fashion a workable
agreement.
   But earlier this year, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd raised
the issue with Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. And Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and now
Democratic vice presidential nominee, asked the U.S. International
Trade Commission to prepare a report listing the pros and cons of
such an agreement.
   The interest is driven not only by the increasingly complex
trade relationship between the two countries, but by concerns by
both about their trade relations with other nations.
   Japan has concerns about how the U.S.-Canada free trade
agreement may affect its own trade with the United States and
Canada.
   And both countries are concerned that the lowering of trade
barriers among European Community nations, scheduled for 1992,
could lead to increased difficulty in gaining access to that market.
   David Rohr, a member of the federal International Trade
Commission who recently visited Japan to gather opinions for the
study requested by Bentsen, said the Japanese are ``really scared''
of the sweeping U.S. trade bill _ signed into law last week and
criticized by Matsunaga as ``disproportionately protectionist'' _
because of its sanctions for unfair trade practices.

<HEAD>Sneaker Maker Uses James Dean, Funky Colors To Revive Canvas
Classics</HEAD>

   Converse Inc. has James Dean,
fire-engine red and Greenwich Village to thank for reviving sales
of canvas sneakers at the company whose reputation was built on an
Indiana basketball player named Chuck Taylor.
   Long considered a traditionalist in an industry where fashion
and high technology move like a fast break, 80-year-old Converse is
trying to shed its image of what one industry observer called ``a
jock company.''
   But in doing that, Converse has relied on its old canvas
standards: the Chuck Taylor All-Star for basketball and the Jack
Purcell for tennis. With nostalgia trendy, Converse sales climbed
to a record $318 million last year.
   ``We're still perceived to be a male basketball shoe company,''
said Converse president Gib Ford, who wore Chuck Taylors when
playing on the 1956 U.S. Olympic basketball team. ``We've had a
very difficult time trying to break the image.''
   Founded by Marquis M. Converse near this town about 25 miles
north of Boston, the Converse Rubber Shoe Company in 1917
introduced the first sneaker designed for basketball _ a high-top
brown canvas shoe with black rubber sole that became the Chuck
Taylor and has remained unchanged since 1936.
   But the development of leather basketball sneakers and athletic
footwear for everything from aerobics to racquetball to walking
forced Converse to retrench.
   In an attempt to stay competitive with industry leaders Reebok
and Nike, Converse in the last three years has doubled research to
about $3 million, hired a team of industrial designers and doubled
advertising to around $20 million.
   And while they don't always seem happy about it, Converse
executives acknowledge that fashion is a part of today's footwear
industry. The Chuck Taylor, which became funky in Manhattan in
late-1986, now comes in 56 colors and motifs, including robin-egg
blue, day-glo orange and graffiti splash.
   The company sold a record 13.5 million pair of All-Stars in
1987, but sales are expected to drop to around 10 million this
year. Sales of the simplistic Oxford-white Jack Purcell, named for
a Canadian badminton star, are projected to grow almost six times,
to about 300,000.
   Converse's reliance on the fad appeal of its canvas classics is
viewed in the industry as risky, and the company says it is pushing
its women's, children's and high-tech ``energy-return'' athletic
shoes.
   ``They hit with the Chucks and the colors because it became a
fashion item. When that slows down, they go back to being an
athletic company,'' said Matt Zale, owner of U.S. Athletics, a
15-store retail chain in Manhattan and Long Island.
   The Jack Purcell, made of No. 10 duck canvas with a thin blue
band semi-circling the toe and a flat bottom, was developed by the
B.F. Goodrich Co. in 1932. Converse bought the shoe in 1972 along
with Goodrich's footwear division.
   Sales reached 750,000 pair annually in the mid-'70s but quickly
declined as leather tennis sneakers hit the market. By the end of
the decade, Converse was selling just 50,000 Jack Purcells a year,
and doing no promotion for the shoe.
   Then the company's tennis marketing manager, walking in Harvard
Square two years ago, spotted a 1955 poster of James Dean looking
vaguely beat generation as he lounged on a movie set in chinos and
T-shirt.
   ``Lo and behold, he had on a pair of Jack Purcells,'' said Lou
Nagy, Converse's marketing communications director.
   The company this year shaped a $500,000 advertising campaign
around the poster, promoting the Jack Purcell in magazines such as
Esquire, GQ and The New Yorker.
   Purcell, 84, said in an interview from his Toronto home that the
sturdy sneaker was revolutionary at a time when ``blisters and sore
heels and turned ankles were the order of the day.''
   ``It's almost identical to what it was back in the '30s,'' said
Purcell, a semi-retired stockbroker who first won the world
badminton championship in 1932. ``Basically it was a soundly
engineered product right from the start.
   ``It's still a very comfortable item,'' he added. ``I'm wearing
a pair right now.''
   The current nostalgia binge isn't the first for Converse. In the
1960s, low-top black canvas sneakers were popularized by California
beach boys and became standard high school and college dress
nationwide.
   The surge in sales of Chuck Taylors was based on looks on the
street not durability on the court. Converts to Jack Purcells
mostly are after the sneaker's retro-1950s look.
   ``The industry is attributing the success of Converse to ... a
kind of return to classics plus the value you get from a canvas
shoe,'' said one athletic footwear industry analyst who asked not
to be named.
   Chuck Taylors and Jack Purcells retail for under $30. Leather
basketball sneakers today, including Converse models, can cost from
$60 to $100.
   Converse changed hands three times in its first 64 years before
it was sold to Eltra Corp., an industrial manufacturer, in 1972.
Sales plummeted to a low of $119 million in 1979, when Converse was
bought by Allied Corp.
   Two years later, Allied put the shoemaker on the block, but a
group of executives engineered a leveraged buyout to forestall
another sale. The company went public in 1982, but four years later
was acquired by Interco Inc., a consumer goods manufacturer and
retailer that is currently the target of an unfriendly takeover
attempt.
   After the 1979 low, Converse sales gradually grew to $266
million in 1984, dropped to $220 million and then soared as Chuck
Taylors became fashionable.
   Taylor, who played for teams in Buffalo and New York, worked for
Converse from 1921 until his death in 1969.
   His model shoe was the dominant sneaker among pros and on city
playgrounds through the 1960s, when it was worn by more than 90
percent of pro and college players. More teen-age girls than
basketball players wear the sneaker now.
   ``Nobody ever thought they'd see the colors,'' Ford said. ``I'm
sure if Chuck knew he'd roll over in his grave.''

<HEAD>Firm Mapping Out America For Personal Computers Meets With Success</HEAD>

   Long after explorers charted their course by
stars or compass, a computer software pioneer has literally mapped
out a product and a business strategy that is guiding his company
to success.
   The 3-year-old company is MapInfo Corp., which sells a software
package that allows the personal computer user to merge databases
and digital maps of areas within the United States.
   With a couple of keystrokes, the user can place the cursor at a
point on a map displayed on the computer screen and have access to
volumes of information about that point.
   MapInfo can search a database for points within a boundary,
determine latitude and longitude of a point or find an address.
Users can focus in on a 52-foot span of a city block or zoom out to
a 5,000-mile range.
   That may not sound like anything new, says MapInfo President
Sean O'Sullivan with a smile, but his young company claims to be
No.1 in desktop mapping. In fact, he says, there isn't even any
competition _ yet.
   ``These kinds of capabilities have been available on
minicomputers and mainframes before, but it's never been made so
that the common person can use it or it's never been priced so that
the common person can afford it,'' said O'Sullivan, who developed
the company with three other students of Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in 1985.
   While some might view MapInfo's product as competition for
mapping via larger computers, it can also complement those methods,
says Thomas Delaney, manager in IBM's geographic and mapping
products department in Kingston, N.Y.
   IBM is on MapInfo's list of customers, and is also a competitor.
   ``The market is not really a market where if you do PC stuff,
you're going to influence mainframes. It really all has to work
together,'' he said.
   Delaney refused to say if IBM, which now is involved in mapping
using mainframes and minicomputers, is developing a program that
would be comparable to MapInfo's.
   So just who uses digital maps and databases on personal
computers?
   Companies or individuals use MapInfo for sales and marketing,
trend analysis, demographic analysis, dispatching and even planning
of routes for optical fiber cables.
   Customers include police departments who want to map out crime
scenes, real estate agents, city planners, cemetery planners,
orange growers and scientists tracking insect populations or AIDS
concentrations.
   ``Even if the job is really large ... and they've (clients) got
their heart set on a larger system, we would recommend MapInfo to
start out with and to train their people, if nothing else,'' said
Mickey Talton, vice president of CAPS Consulting, which works with
the growing market of geographical information systems.
   Based in Tuscaloosa, Ala., CAPS Consulting deals primarily with
urban planning departments and recommends MapInfo frequently
because of its quality, speed with large databases, ease of use and
price, he said.
   ``Smaller cities and smaller government entities can afford to
have this in their offices,'' he said.
   O'Sullivan said sales went from zero to millions within one
year, but he refuses to disclose figures.
   Their customers, which are located in 18 countries, include the
U.S. Postal Service, United Parcel Service, the U.S. Geological
Survey, American Telephone & Telegraph Co., Chrysler Corp., General
Motors Corp., Chemical Bank and McDonald's Corp.
   This spring, MapInfo won a $250,000 contract with the U.S. Army
to provide mapping software to its recruiting command.
   The system will be used for sales and marketing applications to
help the Army better allocate recruiting personnel.
   ``There's a potential (for MapInfo) to be a $50 (million) to a
$100 million dollar company down the road,'' O'Sullivan said.
   MapInfo came to be when O'Sullivan completed the design of an
electronic map and tracking system for automobiles as part of a
college project. By the time Sullivan graduated in 1985, he and
three other engineers and programmers had joined with business
consultant Michael Marvin and obtained financial backing to launch
the firm.
   The first digital mapping system was unveiled in 1987, the
current version in January 1988.
   The software package costs $750 and digital maps for 300
metropolitan areas in the United States range in price up to $2,000.
   The programs provide names of streets, rivers and bridges, as
well as address number ranges for every block and side of a street.
   Buyers can also use the software with their own maps.
   Because the firm has met with success so far and has been
written about in technical magazines, the threat of competition
always looms.
   ``We always feel like we're running against ghosts,'' said
Marvin, who is MapInfo's chief executive officer.
   An offshoot of the firm called Map Media International was
launched this spring, which uses the MapInfo software and adapts it
to the markets for newspaper and television.
   And at MapInfo, the development staff is always working on the
next version of the mapping system.
   ``This company actually has the chance to be one of the top 10
software companies in the United States, because the market is just
exploding at this point in time,'' O'Sullivan contended.

<HEAD>DeKalb Breaking Up To Make Up With Analysts, Drive Up Stock Price</HEAD>

   Breaking up may be hard to do, but it's a great
way to get the attention of the people who matter most, Bruce
Bickner might say.
   Bickner is neither a lonely hearts columnist nor a pop
psychologist offering advice to the lovelorn. He is president of
DeKalb Corp., an Illinois conglomerate that is about to break up
into three, possibly four, publicly traded companies.
   The scheduled Aug. 31 split will allow each of DeKalb's lines of
business _ oil and gas exploration, agricultural genetics, oil-well
servicing and irrigation-equipment manufacturing _ to stand alone.
   Investors have been gobbling up DeKalb's stock in anticipation
of the restructuring. In the 10 months since the company announced
the plan, its stock price has soared from about $20 to near $32.
   But behind the rising value of DeKalb's stock are the ``buy''
recommendations of research analysts who largely had ignored the
company until its break-up plans became apparent.
   DeKalb had net income of $42.9 million on revenues of $367
million last year, compared with a 1986 loss of $50.7 million on
revenues of $406.7 million. But despite the company's greatly
improved performance since 1986, DeKalb found few analysts willing
to follow a firm with such disparate interests.
   ``The large (investment) houses just don't seem to cooperate
across industry lines,'' Bickner said in a recent interview in
Chicago. DeKalb is based in the northern Illinois city of DeKalb.
   ``Somebody who covers the food industry and would, by nature,
understand DeKalb's agricultural business would be reluctant to
cover DeKalb because they don't know what to do with the oil
business,'' he said. ``If they're writing a report on DeKalb and
most of DeKalb's assets are in oil and gas reserves, what are they
going to say about the stock?''
   Several analysts now following the company agreed that DeKalb's
diversification, regarded as a plus in the 1960s and 1970s, worked
against its stock value in the past two years even though the
50-year-old firm clearly was recovering from its weak period of the
early 1980s.
   ``I'm an oil analyst,'' said Charles M. Strain of Houston-based
Lovett Mitchell Webb & Garrison, ``and it's hard enough for me to
follow 20 or 30 oil companies without following one that's at least
as subject to the vagaries of the hybrid corn seed business as it
is to the vagaries of the oil business.
   ``I get very uncomfortable with my knowledge of the seed
business,'' he added.
   Research analysts prefer simplicity, said Michael J. Harris, an
energy analyst with Morgan Keegan & Co. of Memphis who began
recommending DeKalb's stock last year.
   ``Logical diversification makes some kind of sense,'' he said.
``But when you're in the agriculture business and you also own gas
and oil _ the ag analysts don't understand oil and gas, and the oil
analysts don't understand agriculture.''
   DeKalb's restructuring plan calls for distributing a half share
of stock in the agricultural company, to be called DeKalb Genetics
Corp., and one share of stock in Pride Petroleum Services Inc., the
oil-well servicing company, for each share of DeKalb Corp. stock.
   DeKalb Corp. then will be renamed DeKalb Energy Co. and will
concentrate on oil and gas exploration.
   Finally, the company plans an initial public offering of the
Lindsay Manufacturing Co., its wholly owned irrigation
manufacturing and marketing division. John Stafford, DeKalb's chief
financial officer, said the Lindsay offering is tentatively planned
for September, but the date will depend on market conditions and
the timing of regulatory approval.
   DeKalb currently has two types of stock: class A voting stock,
which is not publicly traded, and class B non-voting stock, which
is publicly traded. The Roberts family, which founded DeKalb in the
1930s, controls 60 percent of the class A stock and thus controls
the company.
   After the split, the Roberts family will retain control of
DeKalb Energy and DeKalb Genetics. But Pride Petroleum will have
only one class of stock, all voting. Only 20 percent of that stock
will be owned by the Roberts family.
   ``The family is retaining its absolute control of the genetics
and energy business but giving up absolute control of Pride,''
Bickner said.
   Analysts have estimated the aggregate value of the companies
after the spinoff at $34 to $40 a share. DeKalb Energy is expected
to trade around $20 a share, DeKalb Genetics at about $10 and
DeKalb Corp. at around $7.
   In addition to demonstrating the importance of analyst coverage
to a stock's value, DeKalb's break-up illustrates the declining
popularity among investors of conglomerates in favor of so-called
``pure plays'' _ companies with only one line of business.
   ``I think the last time it was an advantage to be a conglomerate
was in the late '60s. In the late '60s they were magic,'' said
Strain.
   Analyst Harris agreed.
   ``Twenty years ago there was a mindset among corporate
executives that they were going to be portfolio managers; they
would buy and sell companies and get big and diversify and that was
good,'' he said.
   ``But in the last few years it's finally dawned on people that
managers should not be portfolio managers,'' Harris added. ``They
should run businesses and let the investors arrange their own
portfolios.''

<HEAD>Ad Agency Stocks Sidelined This Olympic Year</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: This is for Monday PMs.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians and Olympic sponsors usually try for
the limelight with advertising every four years, but their efforts
this year have failed to make ad company stocks stars on Wall
Street.
   Industry analysts estimate that the major advertising stocks as
a group have underperformed the broader market by about 10 percent
this year.
   They say the outlook for the group remains tied closely to the
performance of the economy next year.
   ``The industry has gone through three tough years,'' said Alan
Gottesman, who follows the ad business for the investment firm
PaineWebber.
   But he said the rigors of industry consolidation and
cost-cutting may have put the group in a position to benefit from
whatever surprises may lie ahead.
   Over the past two years, consolidation created some huge ad
holding companies _ Omnicom Group Inc., WPP Group PLC and a bigger
Saatchi & Saatchi PLC. The publicly-held ad companies also include
Interpublic Group of Companies Inc., Ogilvy Group and Foote, Cone &
Belding Communications Inc.
   Simultaneously, agencies were laying off workers and taking
other cost-cutting steps. Gottesman estimates ad industry
employment is down 3 percent to 5 percent from a year ago.
   The belt-tightening came in time for the industry to reap
earnings benefits from ad spending growth expected due to the
elections and the Olympic Games.
   But the anticipated spurt has largely failed to materialize.
   In June, the industry guru Robert J. Coen of the ad agency
McCann-Erickson scaled back his estimate of U.S. ad spending growth
for the year to 8.4 percent, down from the 9 percent gain he had
forecast six months earlier.
   Some other ad industry analysts expect even slower growth.
   James Dougherty, who follows advertising stocks for County
Securities, said ``the quadrennial year is turning out to be a big
zero.'' He expects an increase excluding direct mail spending of 5
percent to 6 percent this year.
   Dougherty said the economy is at a different stage in the
business cycle than it was when ad spending climbed at double-digit
rates in 1976 and 1984.
   ``The economic news this year hasn't been bad, but it hasn't
been as good as it was in those years at the beginning of a big
expansion,'' he said.
   Charles Crane, who follows the ad business for Prudential-Bache
Securities, said U.S. ad spending should rise about 7 percent this
year.
   He said spending didn't get its normal quadrennial lift because
consumer spending increases have been anemic. That hurt ad stocks,
he said, because ``the market has been shying away from consumer
cyclical stocks this year.''
   Looking ahead, Coen expects ad spending will grow 7.5 percent in
1989, while Dougherty and Crane expect growth roughly matching this
year's pace.
   Dougherty noted that commercial time is sold out on the summer
Olympics broadcasts, and that advance sales of time on the three
major television networks for the fall exceeded last year's strong
totals.
   But even so, he said ``I don't have anybody telling me clients
are increasing their budgets.''
   Crane said a pickup may occur in consumer spending as the trauma
of last fall's stock market crash recedes, and said that would make
the case ``for 1989 not being a bad year at all.''
   As a result he finds the ad stocks ``attractive, with the caveat
that I don't expect a recession before 1990.''
   In their search for new ways to generate revenue, some of the
major ad agencies have been buying marketing services firms that
offer the consulting, promotion and design work that ad companies
once spurned.
   Dougherty said the results from this shopping spree have been
mixed.
   Crane said a gradual movement by major advertisers away from the
flat-fee system of compensating ad agencies could be a boon to
well-managed agencies.
   Under some new methods, agencies are taking lower base rates but
get incentive payments if their advertising works, boosting sales
or market share.
   Gottesman said the recent pace of new product introductions
indicates that consumer products companies are taking risks and
becoming more agressive. That could be a plus for ad companies
because new product rollouts usually mean more advertising.
   He is not pushing the group, but feels good about it.
   ``If there are no surprises, the ad stocks go sideways,''
Gottesman said. ``But if we see some surprises, the surprises will
likely be on the good side and the stocks are going to go up.''

<HEAD>Westinghouse Reaches Tentative Agreement With Four Unions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. reached tentative
national labor agreements Sunday with four unions representing
14,000 workers.
   Details of the three-year agreement were not announced, pending
notification of the union membership. Ratification votes are
expected to take place over the next two weeks.
   ``We have arrived at an innovative pay and benefits package that
is uniquely tailored to the needs of Westinghouse and its
employees,'' said George Dorman, Westinghouse vice president of
human resources.
   Dorman said he was optimistic the rank-and-file membership would
ratify the pact. The current pact expired at midnight Sunday.
   The four unions are: the International Union of Electronic,
Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, or the IUE,
representing 3,000 workers; the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, or the IBEW, representing 5,600 employees; the
Federation of Westinghouse Independent Salaried Unions,
representing 5,400 workers; and the United Electrical, Radio and
Machine Workers of America, or the UE, representing 130 workers.
   The unions represent about 5,075 employees in western
Pennsylvania and 9,000 workers throughout the country.
   About 31 other unions representing Westinghouse's remaining
11,000 employees negotiate independent agreements plant-by-plant,
said Westinghouse spokesman Jim Schmitt.
   General Electric Co., a Westinghouse competitor whose labor
contracts influence the industry, agreed in July with the IUE, the
IBEW and the UE on a three-year contract that raises the average
hourly GE wage from $12.02 to $13.40.
   The average hourly wage at Westinghouse was about $12.50,
Schmitt said.
