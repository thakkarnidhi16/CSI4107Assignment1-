<TEXT>
   President Reagan likes to boast that Marxists
have not gained a ``single square inch'' of territory during his
tenure, and one of his more satisfying moments occurred when a
communist government actually was uprooted.
   Rolling back communism was once an American cold war battle cry
but Marxist regimes always proved remarkably resilient. In the
post-World War II era, the trend was constant: When Marxists took
power, they were there to stay.
   Five years ago that pattern was interrupted. On Oct. 25, 1983,
U.S. troops, aided by forces from seven friendly Caribbean
countries, deposed the leftist government in Grenada.
   Was the administration telling the truth when it said the
invasion was justified by dangers confronting the more than 700
American medical students on the island? Or was that just an excuse
for striking a blow against a country simply because it had ties to
the Soviet bloc?
   Was Grenada an event of transcendental importance or merely a
speck on the historical horizon? Did the Soviets see Grenada, with
its deep water port, as an ideal stopping off place for nuclear
missile submarines?
   To Michael Ledeen, a former administration aide who spent months
studying official documents captured on Grenada by U.S. military
forces, the events of October 1983 had an ``enormous impact''
psychologically.
   ``It may well be that 20 years from now, people will say that
was the beginning of the end of the Soviet empire,'' Ledeen said.
   ``The Russians had always claimed that once a country became
part of communist world, it was there to stay. Grenada proved that
it wasn't.''
   But former National Security Council aide Oliver L. North felt
that Grenada could not be regarded as a major defeat for
international communism because the government there was ousted by
foreign invaders, not by a popular uprising.
   Assistant Secretary of State Langhorne A. Motley who, like
North, played a key behind-the scenes role in coordinating the
invasion, said the episode sent a clear message to America's
friends and adversaries.
   ``It showed that the United States was prepared to use force in
the defense of its national interests,'' said Motley, who left
government service in 1985.
   Motley insisted that the driving force behind the invasion was
concern for the fate of the American medical students on the island
after leftist opponents of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop deposed
and then executed him and about 50 of his supporters on the
bloodiest day in Grenada's history.
   Afterward, the revolutionary military council which ousted
Bishop imposed a 24-hour curfew. Motley noted there was no official
U.S. presence on the island and said State Department efforts to
obtain information about the students were unsuccessful.
   He and other officials were haunted by the memory of the 52
American hostages who had been detained by Iranian militants for
444 days. As Motley described it, alarm at the State Department
mounted as the days passed with no word on whether the students
were safe.
   He ridiculed the notion that the prime U.S. concern in going
ahead with the invasion was the existence of a pro-Soviet
government in Grenada.
   ``The primary and overwhelming consideration was the safety of
the students,'' he said.
   But Cuban President Fidel Castro has said the administration
fabricated a ``mountain of lies'' about the supposed dangers
confronting the students. He felt the administration was guided
above all by aggressive intentions.
   Ramon Sanchez Parodi, head of Cuba's diplomatic mission in
Washington, said the stated U.S. concern about the students was a
``very thin veil'' covering the Reagan administration's true intent.
   ``There was no effort of a non-military nature to take the
students out,'' Sanchez Parodi said. The United States, he said,
had no purpose other than to ``impose its will'' on the people of
Grenada. In the aftermath, Cuba moved quickly to bolster its own
self-defense, worried that it might be the next American target.
   Answering critics, Reagan noted that the U.S. intervention was
carried out at the request of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States, which was worried about Grenada being used as a base of
subversion against Caribbean democracies. Some had security forces
totaling only a few dozen compared with Grenada's force of 4,000.
   When the Reagan administration took office in 1981, it found the
trends in the Caribbean area worrisome. Leftist governments had
assumed power over the previous two years in Grenada, Nicaragua and
Suriname.
   In Grenada, Bishop's government moved quickly to establish close
ties with Cuba. A large contingent of Cubans began constructing an
airport capable of handling Cuba's large fleet of MiG jet fighters.
   Although Bishop insisted that the airport was designed for
commercial purposes, U.S. military analysts were concerned that the
facility had the potential for enabling Cuba to project its
military power for the first time into the northern tier of South
America. Captured documents showed that Grenada had entered into
three military agreements with the Soviet Union and one each with
Cuba and North Korea _ all secret.
   Whatever the objectives of the Soviet bloc in Grenada might have
been, the ouster of a friendly government there and its replacement
by an avowedly pro-American regime was a setback, especially for
Castro.
   Cuba had committed substantial resources in Grenada for more
than four years and Castro had nothing to show for it. The 25th
anniversary of his own revolution, which occurred nine weeks after
the Grenada invasion, was a low key affair instead of the big
extravaganza he had planned.
   The invasion also produced shock waves in Nicaragua and
Suriname. In Managua, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega was
determined not to allow the United States to use the same pretext
for invading Nicaragua as it did in Grenada.
   He called U.S. Ambassador Anthony Quainton and offered him
unlimited use of Nicaragua's bus fleet to evacuate Americans from
the country. In Suriname, military leader Desi Bouterse, worried
that the large and growing Cuban presence in his country might be
seen as a provocation by the United States, ordered the Cubans home.
   Delighted that the invasion seemed to make America's adversaries
in the hemisphere squirm, one official facetiously said at the time
that the best way to deal with Nicaragua was to set up a medical
school for Americans in the country.
   The invasion, of course, was not cost-free. Eighteen Americans,
45 Grenadans and 29 Cubans were killed during the fighting.
   But given the fact that the students were spared potential harm
and the Soviet bloc had lost an ally in the process, the
administration felt the loss of life was worth it.
   The episode helped ease the anguish of what was perhaps the
darkest moment of the Reagan presidency: the deaths of 241 U.S.
Marines in a bombing incident in Lebanon just two days before the
Grenada invasion.

<HEAD>Nobody Doles Out Political Dollars Like the Teamsters</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>

   The gun lobby, physicians and real estate
agents are potent political forces with multimillion-dollar
campaign chests. But when it comes to doling out dollars, nobody
does it like the Teamsters.
   For every dollar the National Rifle Association spends on this
year's election, the Teamsters spend $3. For every $3 the American
Medical Association or the National Association of Realtors spends,
the Teamsters spend $4.
   Fulfilling Jackie Presser's dream that his union become a
``political giant'' and believing firmly that money is the key, the
government-besieged Teamsters have amassed the largest campaign
chest of any business, labor or special interest group in the
nation.
   ``Without money, you're going nowhere in the political arena in
this country,'' the late Teamsters president told the AFL-CI0 when
he brought his union back into the labor federation a year ago.
   The Teamsters, under new President William McCarthy, broke with
the AFL-CIO, at least politically, last week and endorsed George
Bush over Michael Dukakis.
   Under Presser, the Teamsters' DRIVE (Democratic Republican
Independent Voter Education) fund grew from less than $250,000 in
1980 into the nation's richest political action committee.
   As of Sept. 1, the Teamsters' PAC had collected $7,692,850 from
the union's 1.6 million members, most of it through dollar-a-week
payroll deductions from 100,000 interstate truck drivers and United
Parcel Service employees.
   With DRIVE growing at a rate of $400,000 to $500,000 a month and
including 15 other PACs operated by the some of its larger locals
and state councils, the Teamsters stand to spend more than $10
million before the 1988 election is over.
   The biggest PACs in past elections _ the National Association of
Realtors and the American Medical Association _ had accumulated
$4,841,363 and $4,759,178, respectively, as of July, according to
Federal Election Commission records. The National Rifle
Association's Political Victory Fund stood at $1,993,665.
   The primary impetus behind the geometric growth of the
Teamsters' political spending was the deregulation of the trucking
industry in 1980.
   The Teamsters found then they had only 26 allies in the Senate
when they tried to block the move, and former union President Roy
Williams went to prison for five years for attempting to bribe
former Sen. Howard Cannon, D-Nev., to derail the legislation.
   Presser vowed that the union would never suffer that kind of
political defeat again, a viewed echoed by McCarthy, a veteran
Boston area labor leader.
   ``We have to show our appreciation to those in Congress who
support working men and women, and we do this best through DRIVE,''
McCarthy told a meeting of East Coast Teamster leaders last month
at Hilton Head, S.C.
   ``Because of deregulation, we don't have any trouble signing our
UPS and freight guys .. up for DRIVE,'' said Dave Sweeney, the
Teamsters' legislative director.
   ``They've seen all the freight companies going out of business,
all the madness out there,'' Sweeney said. ``You don't have to
convince them we need to be politically active.''
   High on the union's political agenda is legislation to outlaw
double-breasting _ the simultaneous operation of union and
non-union shops under the same ownership or management.
   Despite the Teamsters' surprise endorsement of Bush last week,
FEC records show 88 percent of their contributions to federal
candidates go to Democrats and 12 percent to Republicans _ about
the same ratio as organized labor as a whole.
   The Teamsters had funneled some $1.6 million to 282 Democratic
House and Senate candidates and $190,000 to 52 Republicans as of
Sept. 1, according to the latest government records.
   Among the recipients: Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass, who got
$5,000. Kennedy is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F.
Kennedy, who put Teamster leaders like Jimmy Hoffa and William
Presser _ Jackie Presser's father _ in jail.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen has received $9,000 in Teamster money this
year _ all of it before Dukakis tapped Bentsen as his running mate
and all devoted to Bentsen's simultaneous Texas campaign for
re-election to the Senate.
   The Teamsters gave Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.,
$5,000 when he was running for re-election to the Senate two years
ago.
   Besides being incumbents, Quayle and Bentsen shared another
trait common to beneficiaries of Teamsters largess: chairmanships
of subcommittees and committees vital to the union's legislative
agenda.
   Quayle was chairman of the Senate labor subcommittee at the time
and Bentsen now chairs the Senate Finance Committee responsible for
shaping the nation's tax and trade laws.
   Indirect Teamster political aid for voter registration, phone
banks and gubernatorial and state legislative candidates totaled
more than $2.5 million as of September, according to FEC records.
   As of Sept. 1, the Teamsters' had a $3 million cash balance in
their DRIVE account.
   Like many construction unions, the Teamsters are more inclined
than most AFL-CIO affiliates and the federation's Committee on
Political Education (COPE) to side with a friendly GOP incumbent
over a Democratic challenger.
   ``If a Republican supports you six or seven times out of 10, you
ought to be able to support him,'' Sweeney said.

   In at least one case this year, that approach has caused a major
rift between union's headquarters and local Teamster leaders.
   Teamster officials in Connecticut wanted the union to support
Democratic Attoney General Joseph I. Lieberman's bid to unseat
veteran Republican Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.; national union
leaders preferred Weicker.
   ``You defeat the system and the whole purpose of a political
action committee if you work against a guy like Weicker who has a
100 percent pro-labor voting record,'' Sweeney said.
   Sweeney said officials in his office also try to dissuade
Teamster locals from ``going after a very conservative Republican
where you can't beat him.''
   He cited veteran conservative Republican Reps. James H. Quillen
of Tennessee, the ranking minority member on the House Rules
Committee, and Donald E. Lukens of Ohio. Both have large Teamster
locals in their districts.
   And both, according to Sweeney, were instrumental in getting
signatures from other ``pillars of the far right'' such as Rep.
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., on letters from 264 House members condemning
a Justice Department suit to take over the union under the
Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act.
   The suit has become an issue in some House campaigns.
   The campaign manager for incumbent Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb.,
suggested that Democratic opponent, Warren Jones, return a $5,000
DRIVE contribution. The Teamsters gave Jones another $5,000.
   Thomas H. Fetzer Jr., the GOP opponent of Rep. David E. Price,
D-N.C., challenged Price's acceptance of $10,000 from the Teamsters
in light of the suit.
   Rep. James McClure Clark, D-N.C., was accused of accepting
``tainted'' Teamster money by his opponent, Republican Charles H.
Taylor.
   Clark responded that he has yet to hear Taylor or any Republican
``suggest that President Reagan return any contributions'' from the
Teamsters in the union's endorsement of him in 1980 and 1984.
   Sweeney said the attacks have stopped since the Teamsters
complained to Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Stevens talked to
former Republican Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada, now an adviser to the
Bush campaign.
   ``We think it was organized, they deny it,'' he said.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, sent a letter to colleagues
suggesting they ``neutralize'' the attacks by pointing to the
Teamsters' $189,275 in contributions to Republicans.
   Among them, according to the FEC, are $8,000 to Sen. Phil Gramm
of Texas, $5,000 to House Republican Leader Robert Michel of
Illinois and $1,000 to House Republican Whip Trent Lott, who is
seeking the Senate seat of retiring Mississippi Democrat John
Stennis.

   Two young whales trapped by ice
tentatively tested a narrow escape route to open water Sunday that
was being carved with chain saws by Eskimos who ordinarily hunt
whales.
   A National Guard helicopter hammered at the ice off Alaska's
northern coast with a 5-ton chunk of concrete. But the whales were
more than three miles from a strech of open water, with a massive
ice ridge in between and a wind shift threatening to push ice
around them and trap them further.
   Rescuers said that even if everything went as planned, it would
be at least Wednesday night before they could get the whales as far
as the ridge.
   As crews concentrated on coaxing the whales to freedom, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration asked for help from
two Soviet icebreakers.
   The icebreakers, Admiral Makorov and Vladimir Arseniev, however,
need about 39 feet of water to operate, the Soviet news agency TASS
reported. The whales are trapped in an area where water depth
varies from 12 to 25 feet.
   NOAA Rear Admiral Sigmund R. Petersen, director of the Pacific
Marine Center in Seattle, said even if the icebreakers cannot reach
the whales, they could help clear a path to the first opening, or
lead, from open water 200 miles away.
   Petersen said that depending on ice conditions, the ships could
reach Barrow by noon Tuesday.
   While high-technology equipment poured into Barrow during the
weekend, Eskimos using chain saws and their strong backs made the
most progress at freeing the California gray whales from a tiny
breathing hole.
   About two dozen natives hacked 34 breathing holes Saturday, for
a total of about 60 holes extending more than 1{ miles from where
three whales were stranded by moving ice about two weeks ago before
they could migrate south.
   The smallest and youngest of the whales, named Bone, disappeared
Friday night and was presumed dead.
   Just as the tedious hole-cutting hit its stride, the whales
balked, advancing only a few hundred feet past a large opening
where they spent Friday night and most of Saturday.
   Biologists said the animals had gone back to earlier breathing
holes, sometimes breaking up to 2 inches of ice to surface. They
said that was a good sign because the marine mammals still must
negotiate 200 miles of ice before hitting open water if they are
freed.
   ``If they know they are capable of doing that, they may continue
doing so,'' said biologist Jim Harvey.
   ``Basically, we have to condition them that their best chance of
survival is to move ahead to new holes,'' Harvey said.
   He said rescuers planned to begin filling or covering the holes
behind the whales to force them along the desired path.
   Rescuers said they feared the whales were spooked by an
underwater shoal. North Slope Borough biologist Geoff Carroll said
most of the water in the area is about 20 feet deep, compared to
only 12 or 13 feet of water in the shoal.
   ``You figure two feet of ice and five feet of whale, and that
doesn't leave them too much room to swim,'' Carroll said. ``I don't
blame them for not wanting to go through there.''
   Whaling captain Arnold Brower, whose crew used donated chain
saws to help free the animals, was frustrated by the whales'
reluctance.
   ``If we move them, then I'll call it progress,'' Brower said,
leaning down to push the snout of a surfacing whale in the
direction he wanted it to go.
   Ron Morris, a biologist with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said sonar would be used to see if
there is an easy way around the shoal.
   The surviving whales appeared to be healthy, immature whales
estimated at 27 to 35 feet long, said David Withrow of the Marine
Mammal Institute in Seattle. He said one apparently was a yearling
and the other was 2 to 3 years old.
   Rescuers worked in the dark using portable lights, snowmobile
headlights and de-icing equipment dubbed ``the bubblers'' to keep
the holes open ahead of the whales.
   The Skycrane helicopter on Saturday used its concrete plunger to
probe the ridge, a jumble of ice blocks as big as a house, but the
battering ram seldom penetrated. The ridge formed by colliding ice
masses is several hundred yards wide.
   Of additional concern was a shift in the wind, which Eskimo
hunters said could turn the area where the whales were trapped into
an impassable jumble of ice rubble.
   NOAA spokesman Brian Gorman in Washington, D.C., said the agency
asked for the Soviet icebreakers and they were dispatched under a
1976 cooperative environmental agreement with the Soviet Union.
   He said the rescue effort also involves use of ``some of our own
NOAA satellites to take ice pictures. We are relaying that
information to the Soviets to assist them in determining the most
expeditious route.''
   Heavy ice in the Arctic Ocean earlier disabled two Canadian
icebreakers and the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Star.
   The latest piece of high technology to be thrown into the battle
is a pontoon-mounted vehicle known as an Archimedes screw, which
pulls itself along by augers that eat into the ice.
   While marine biologists called the whales Bone, Crossbeak and
Bonnet, the Eskimos have named the two survivors Siku, or ice, and
Putu, ice hole. The vanished whale they named Knik, one of 28
Eskimo words for snowflake.
   The young whales' lack of experience apparently led them farther
north than the endangered California gray whales normally go, and
caused them to stay too long before starting their annual migration
to the warm water off Mexico's Baja California, Withrow said.
   Harvey and Withrow said the whales have a reasonable chance of
survival if they can be freed within a week.
   Harvey said the whales condition Sunday appeared stable, but
that a wound on the snout of the larger whale appeared worse than
before.
   The rescue effort had attracted so many spectators and news
teams that a police officer was stationed out on the ice to direct
traffic.
   A giant Air Force C5-A cargo plane sent in with fresh equipment
took up so much ground space at Barrow's airport that a commercial
flight didn't have room to land.

<HEAD>10 Injured In Fire At Theatre Showing `Last Temptation of Christ'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire that started in a theater seat heavily damaged
a Left Bank cinema showing ``The Last Temptation of Christ''
Saturday night and injured 10 people, one seriously, police said.
   The fire began about 11 p.m. (6 p.m. EDT) at the St. Michel
cinema, a two-theatre building that for two weeks was the scene of
religious protests against the controversial film by American
director Martin Scorsese.
   The blaze began at a seat in the theatre adjacent to the one
showing ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' at the time the audience
was leaving the Scorsese film, according to fire officials who
spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with departmental policy.
   A theatre employee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
written threats had been received by the cinema.
   Firemen extinguished the blaze an hour later, but officials said
the building suffered serious damage. Theatre manager Gerard Pascal
said the entrance to the theatre looked like it had been bombed. No
precise damage estimate was immediately available.
   The blaze was under investigation by the criminal brigade of the
city police department, indicating arson was suspected.
   ``The flames quickly reached a height of nearly two meters (6.5
feet) and then spread to the stairs where people were leaving the
other theatre,'' said one spectator who declined to give his name.
   Most of those attending the Scorsese film had left and only
about 18 people remained in the theatre when the blaze began, the
news agency Agence France-Presse reported.
   One seriously injured spectator and was taken to Fernand Widal
Hospital, said Raoul Viger, a fire department spokesman. No further
details on his condition were immediately available.
   Two women and a man, who came to the aid of spectators before
firefighters arrived, were taken to Cochin Hospital suffering from
smoke inhalation. Six policemen were also injured, Vigir said.
   About 100 firefighters in 11 trucks filled the Place St. Michel,
a well-known Left Bank square popular with students, and blocked
the street running beside the Seine River while the fire was
brought under control.
   The film, an adaptation of the 1955 Nikos Kazanthakis novel,
sparked demonstrations by Christian groups when it was released in
the United States and Europe.
   Some Christians have been offended by the film's portrayal of
Jesus Christ as a human being with passions and weaknesses rather
than a divine creature. The film includes a scene in which Christ
imagines having sex with the prostitute Mary Magdalene.

   Hurricane Joan tore across Nicaragua
Saturday with 125 mph winds and torrential rains, setting off
floods and mud slides before turning into a tropical storm. In less
than a week, Joan killed at least 70 people and left hundreds of
thousands homeless.
   Lights were cut off across Managua as the storm lashed the
capital. The Voice of Nicaragua radio reported evacuations and
flooding in a wide area around the city; roads were cut and several
people were injured when tree limbs fell across their houses.
   ``We had to look for shelter to save our lives,'' said Xiomara
Campo, sitting on the floor of a church shelter in Rama, about 150
miles east of Managua.
   At midnight Saturday Joan's winds were 40 mph, tropical storm
strength. Hurricane warnings were discontinued but flash flood and
mud slide warnings continued for Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras.
   At least 20 people were reported killed in Nicaragua on
Saturday, 21 in Costa Rica and three in Panama, raising the overall
death toll from the storm in Central and South America since Monday
to 70. In Nicaragua, 140 people were reported missing.
   About 300,000 were left homeless, hundreds were injured and more
than 80,000 were evacuated in the three Central American countries.
   At 4 a.m. Saturday, the eye of the hurricane crossed the
Atlantic coast at Bluefields in Nicaragua, a city surrounded by
mangrove swamps and low-lying jungle about 180 miles east of
Managua.
   Nicaraguan radio reported 15 dead in Bluefields and 90 percent
of the homes in the city were destroyed. Two deaths were reported
north of the city and three deaths and dozens of injuries were
reported on Great Corn Island off eastern Nicaragua.
   Twenty-one people were killed in neighboring Costa Rica and 15
were missing, authorities said. Officials in Panama reported three
deaths and said the Pan-American Highway was closed by mud slides.
   The hurricane, which killed 26 people last week in Colombia and
Venezuela, lurked off the coast for days, giving Central America
time to prepare for the blow.
   Nicaraguan radio reports said officials issued an urgent request
for hospital tents, medicine and clothing. The Bluefields airport
was being inspected to see if Cuban planes could land with relief
supplies, according to the reports.
   President Daniel Ortega said authorities had no idea about the
total number of casualties.
   ``The destruction was total,'' said Ray Hooker, a national
legislator who spoke via government radio from Corn Island. ``There
is not one house with a roof.''
   Hooker said trees, churches, schools, the island's only clinic
and its docks and shrimp processing plant were damaged. He said the
island had one doctor to treat dozens of injuries.
   In Costa Rica, some houses were under water and their
inhabitants were evacuated by boat, said Victor Brenes of the
National Emergency Committee.
   About 8,000 people live on Corn Island and 60,000 in the
Bluefields area. Thousands were evacuated, but Ortega said
thousands more who were unaccustomed to hurricanes ignored warnings
to leave.
   The last hurricane to hit Nicaragua was in 1911. Costa Rica has
never been hit by a hurricane in recorded history.
   ``This is the worst natural phenomenon since the earthquake of
Dec. 23, 1972,'' said an announcer on Nicaragua's government-run
radio network. More than 10,000 people perished in the quake, which
destroyed most of the capital.
   Ortega said Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras attacked an
ambulance during the storm in south-central Nicaragua, wounding the
driver and a child.
   Barricada, the newspaper of Nicaragua's ruling Sandinista party,
said that 20,000 people had been evacuated from one low-lying area
of Managua, but visits by Associated Press reporters Saturday found
little evidence of evacuations on that scale.
   The hurricane hit along the Miskito Coast, an isolated area
whose sparse population is largely English-speaking Indians and
blacks. No main roads connect Bluefields to the rest of the nation.
   At midnight EDT the center of the storm was just outside Managua
at latitude 12.0 north and longitude 86.0 west, according to the
U.S. National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   The storm was expected to continue moving across Nicaragua at
about 9 mph. Rain over 15 inches was likely over Costa Rica,
Nicaragua and parts of Honduras, the hurricane center said.

   The United States won the championship of
the World Contract Bridge Team Olympiad for the first time ever
Saturday, defeating Austria 289-247 in the 96-deal final.
   The United States has won every other world title at least once,
and it now holds the championship in every world event except the
Women's Olympiad.
   Seymon Deutsch of San Antonio, Texas, was the only member of the
team who had never won a world championship.
   ``It's fantastic, it's unreal,'' he said. ``It's the thrill of a
lifetime.''
   Bobby Wolff of Dallas was worried when he finished play.
   ``They played absolutely perfect bridge against us over the
final 16 deals, and I thought we were 2-1 to lose. What a relief to
discover that our teammates did so well.''
   Wolff won the Bermuda Bowl in 1970, 1971, 1977, 1983, 1985 and
1987. Another member of the U.S. team in Venice, Bob Hamman of
Dallas, was his teammate in all those victories. As a partnership,
Wolff and Hamman won the 1974 World Open Pairs. Wolff has also won
the World Mixed Teams.
   Jim Jacoby of Richardson, Texas, also was on the championship
Bermuda Bowl teams in 1970 and 1971. The Olympiad in Venice was his
third world championship.
   Eric Rodwell of Lafayette, Ind., and Jeff Meckstroth of
Columbus, Ohio, were on the team that won the Bermuda Bowl in 1981
and they were runaway victors in the World Open Pairs in 1986.
   Saturday's victory marked the third time Dan Morse, the
non-playing captain, had led teams to victory.
   Playing for Austria in the final were Heinrich Berger, Jan
Fucik, Alfred Kadlek, Friedrich Kubac, Wolfgang Meinl and Franz
Terraneo, with Franz Baratta as the non-playing captain.
   In the Women's Olympiad, Denmark defeated Britain 178-157 in a
64-deal match that concluded Friday.

<HEAD>Emperor's Blood Pressure Sharply Rises; Eric Clapton Insures His
Concert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito was in good spirits Sunday, but
palace officials said his blood pressure rose to its highest level
since he was confined to bed with internal bleeding five weeks ago.
   The 87-year-old monarch's blood pressure at mid-afternoon was
174 over 76, Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda said.
The reading was sharply higher than in the morning, when it was 160
over 70. A normal reading is about 120 over 80.
   High blood pressure places an additional burden on the heart and
other organs and can aggravate internal bleeding.
   Maeda said Hirohito continued to discharge small amounts of
blood from his bowels Saturday and Sunday but remained in good
spirits and was chatting amiably with aides and family members.
   Maeda said earlier that the emperor's serious anemia improved
slightly after large blood transfusions. Hirohito received 24.8
pints of blood since his condition worsened, nearly three times the
normal amount in his body.
   In a related development, British rock guitarist Eric Clapton
reportedly took out a $105,000 insurance policy against
cancellation of his concert tour next month in Japan if Hirohito
dies. The Sun newspaper of London said the policy would pay Clapton
more than $1.75 million.
   Already, many concerts, festivals and other events have been
canceled in Japan because of the emperor's illness.

<TEXT>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat arrived in the Iraqi capital Sunday after
ending a daylong summit with Jordan's King Hussein aimed at
coordinating plans for peace with Israel.
   Aides said their talks with the king helped warm chilly
relations between Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``The talks were very smooth and we are very happy,'' said a
senior PLO official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Iraq, the two were met by President Saddam Hussein and other
senior government officials.
   King Hussein, the two visitors and their delegations appeared
smiling and relaxed earlier Sunday as they bade farewell on the
tarmac of the airport at Aqaba, the Red Sea resort where the talks
took place.
   Arafat's delegation remained in Jordan for more meetings
Tuesday. The senior PLO official said they will be looking to make
``a fresh start'' in relations.
   Jordanian officials said an official communique on the summit
would be released later in the capital, Amman.
   Mubarak's chief political adviser, Osama El-Baz, told reporters
Saturday night the leaders wanted Israelis voting in their Nov. 1
general election ``to know that there is an Arab partner who is
ready for peace.''
   Egyptian and PLO officials told reporters much of the discussion
centered on a proposed confederation between Jordan and an
independent Palestinian state.
   Relations between Arafat and King Hussein have been chilly since
February 1986, when the king froze ties with the PLO leader after a
yearlong joint effort at peace with Israel.
   The Palestinian question has since been transformed by a
10-month uprising against Israel's military occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza strip and by King Hussein's decision to cut ties with
the West Bank, which Jordan ruled from 1948 until 1967.

   Typhoon Ruby dumped heavy
rains and triggered flash floods Sunday in the southern
Philippines, leaving 20,000 homeless, officials said. Two people
drowned and eight others were feared dead.
   At 4:30 p.m. (4:30 a.m. EDT), Ruby was estimated to be about 60
miles southeast of the coastal town of Borongan on Samar island,
about 360 miles southeast of the capital Manila, the Manila weather
bureau said.
   Ruby, centered over the Philippine Sea, had sustained winds of
75 miles per hour and was moving northwest at 15 mph toward
Borongan, said forecaster Pedro Deogracias.
   Deogracias said at that course Ruby will hit Borongan by Monday
morning.
   Col. Triumfo Agustin, Philippine Constabulary regional
commander, said Ruby caused flash floods in the six villages on the
outskirts of Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental province, about 500
miles south of Manila.
   Agustin said 1,000 houses along the bloated Agusan River were
destroyed, leaving at least 20,000 people homeless. He added that
10 people were reportedly carried by the strong current and feared
dead, but only two bodies have so far been recovered.
   The typhoon also destroyed the Agusan bridge, Agustin said.
   A check with relief agencies in Manila could not immediately
confirm the report. Typhoon reports usually take days before
reaching the capital.
   ``We have advised the remaining residents along the river to
seek higher ground,'' Agustin said.
   Manoling Abejuela, Cagayan de Oro's planning engineer, estimated
damage to agricultural crops and houses at $2.4 million dollars.

Guerrillas</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with four guerrillas reported killed.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>HASBAYA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops and allied Christian
militiamen of the South Lebanon Army clashed with guerrillas in the
foothills of Mount Hermon Sunday, police said. Beirut radio
stations reported four guerrillas were killed.
   The sound of machine-gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades
reverberated across the slopes of the mountain, on the northern
edge of Israel's self-designated security zone in south Lebanon.
   ``The battle has been raging since first light,'' said a police
spokesman in Hasbaya at midmorning, after four hours of fighting.
   Hasbaya overlooks the border enclave controlled by Israeli
troops and the predominantly Christian militiamen of the South
Lebanon Army, or SLA.
   ``We haven't any solid information yet, but it seems the
Israelis and the SLA have intercepted a guerrilla party trying to
infiltrate into their zone,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be
named under standing regulations.
   He said he could not tell whether the guerrillas involved in the
battle were Palestinians or Iranian-backed Shiite Moslems from the
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The Voice of Lebanon and Voice of Free Lebanon, both
Christian-controlled, cited unidentified informed sources as saying
four guerrillas died but did not further identify the casualties.
   The Israeli air force blasted Palestinian and Shiite bases in
south Lebanon Friday, killing 21 people and wounding 34, in
apparent revenge for a suicide car bomb attack in the security zone
on Wednesday.
   Seven Israeli soldiers were killed and eight others and two
Lebanese women wounded in the car bombing.
   Israel maintains a six-to-10-mile-wide zone in south Lebanon to
guard against possible attacks by guerrillas in Lebanon on areas in
northern Israel.

   About 700 people wearing red and blue shirts
gathered on a soybean field to be molded into a piece of art by an
artist known for his unusual creations.
   Stan Herd on Saturday popped the top off his latest land-art
creation: a five-acre depiction of two partially crumpled Pepsi and
Coca-Cola soda pop cans.
   The people provided the color; Herd and his unusual ability to
sculpt farm land added the design. The title of the work: ``The
Ottawa Beanfield Cola War.''
   ``When does a person get a chance to be a part of art?'' said
Richard Rudzinski, 45, of Wichita, who stood near the bottom of the
Pepsi can.
   Herd, 38, said one of the messages of the work was a reminder
that people need to take better care of the environment _ the
crumpled cans of pop representing trash thrown on the side of a
highway.
   ``It also was a tongue-in-cheek slap at the way advertising
people depict us,'' he said. ``The battle for the consumer dollar
... the Pepsi generation ... commercialization.''
   Before ``Cola Wars,'' Herd's field art included an Indian chief
sculpted on a field near Dodge City, and a vase of sunflowers on a
checkered tablecloth plowed on a field near Lawrence.
   For his latest creation, the field was cut about 10 days ago.
   The past week was spent mowing the design of the two cans onto
the ground. The bases of the cans were cut soybean, lime was used
to highlight the cans, and the red and blue shirts provided the
brand's familiar colors.
   Three helicopters and several airplanes circled the field as the
participants bowed to create the illusion of the cans.
   The participants had no idea what the finished product looked
like.

   A man who bet a dollar he could swim
underwater from one pool to another at an outdoor fountain died
after becoming trapped under a concrete slab, authorities said.
   Christopher Paulsen, 26, died in a hospital early Saturday, one
week after he was pulled unconscious from the upper tier of Ira's
Fountain across from Portland's Civic Auditorium.
   Witnesses said Paulsen and some friends had been drinking
alcohol, said Officer Henry Groepper, spokesman for the Portland
Police Bureau.
   Paulsen bet a friend he could swim through a narrow conduit that
connects two pools on the upper tier of the fountain. He then
disrobed and attempted the swim but got wedged beneath a concrete
slab covering the conduit, said Terry Sparks, deputy Multnomah
County medical examiner.
   He was revived after being trapped underwater for 20 to 25
minutes, but had been brain dead and on a life support system since
the incident.

<TEXT>
   Atlantis moved a big step toward the
second post-Challenger space shuttle flight when workers moved it
into an assembly building to prepare for next month's launch with a
secret military satellite.
   A tractor Saturday night towed the 85-ton space ship the 450
feet from a processing building where it had been undergoing
modifications for several months.
   In the assembly building over the next several days, Atlantis
will be joined with its two solid fuel booster rockets and large
external fuel tank. In about a week, it will be transported to
launch pad 39B.
   NASA is aiming for a late-November launch, but a date won't be
set until a two-day flight readiness review is completed on Nov. 10.
   The flight will mark the third time in 27 launchings that a
classified Defense Department payload will be carried on a shuttle.
As a result, a shroud of secrecy is being thrown over most
information about it, including the identity of the satellite,
believed to be an intelligence spacecraft.
   A crew of five astronauts, commanded by Navy Cmdr. Robert
Gibson, a veteran of two earlier shuttle flights, will fly the
mission.
   Atlantis will make the second shuttle flight since the
Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts on Jan. 28, 1986.
The launch of Discovery late in September returned American
astronauts to space after a lapse of 32 months during which several
shuttle systems were redesigned.
   On Monday, Discovery's five astronauts will be honored with a
parade in the nearby community of Cocoa Beach. On Tuesday, they
will be at the Kennedy Space Center here to thank the workers who
made their flight possible.

<HEAD>Without Reagan, Fate of Contras Appears Dim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Contras, the Nicaraguan rebels President
Reagan lauded as ``freedom fighters'' and made the centerpiece of
his Central America policy, are fading into history.
   Supporters and opponents alike say the rebels, who once claimed
to be inflicting severe damage on the leftist Sandinista regime
through their forays inside Nicaragua, now are little more than
refugees huddled in camps along the Honduran border.
   ``Every single Contra who died, died for nothing, it turns
out,'' said Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., who has led a losing
battle in the House of Representatives to win military aid for the
rebels. ``I've got to say that I'm depressed about it. I would like
to find a way to put a good light on it, but I can't.''
   Reagan's personal devotion to the Contras has largely sustained
them since they were formed in 1981. Congress, alternately going
along and resisting aid to the rebels, sent at least $294 million
to support the Contras over that period. That doesn't include some
$41 million raised from other countries and private contributors,
or illegally diverted during the Iran-Contra affair.
   As recently as February, there were upwards of 16,000 rebels
inside Nicaragua attacking Sandinista patrols and sabotaging power
and transportation lines. But in deference to a halting effort at
reaching a negotiated cease-fire, U.S. military aid was suspended
Feb. 29.
   According to intelligence estimates, fewer than 2,000 opposition
troops remain inside Nicaragua, struggling to conserve dwindling
supplies of ammunition. The rest have been starved out, forced to
march weeks through the jungle to reach camps just inside Honduras
where they huddle under black plastic shelters and receive U.S.
food and medicine handouts. Nearby, more than 20,000 Contra family
members subsist in similar camps.
   Supporters who have toured the area say morale among the rebels,
astonishingly, remains good. But anti-Contra lawmakers say that
with Congress having adjourned for the year and no chance for new
military aid on the horizon, the Contras appear finished as a
fighting force.
   The rebels' primary patron, Reagan, can do little more for them.
One candidate to succeed him, Democrat Michael Dukakis, opposes the
Reagan Contra policy. The other, Vice President George Bush, is
talking little about what he would do for the rebels if he takes
office in January, and Contra supporters doubt he will have the
same fervor as Reagan.
   Retired Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, who has supported the rebels
for years, last month wrote Bush to warn of an ``impending
disaster'' for the rebels and chastised him for ignoring the issue
in his presidential campaign.
   ``They're moribund,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a leader
of House anti-Contra forces. ``For practical purposes, as a
fighting force they're history.''
   One sign that even the rebels' most devoted backers have given
up is their finger-pointing at Democrats.
   ``They are a people to whom this country owes an obligation,''
said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
   ``Those who want to come to this country are truly refugees.
They would be politically persecuted if they went back to
Nicaragua. We should be talking about reception centers'' in the
United States. ``Fort Worth, Texas, comes to mind,'' Hyde said in a
sarcastic reference to the home district of House Speaker Jim
Wright, the administration's main foe on the Contra issue.
   ``I believe the consequences are going to be very heavy and the
responsibility ought to be very clear,'' added Jeane Kirkpatrick,
Reagan's former United Nations ambassador and a strong Contra
supporter.
   Hyde and Kirkpatrick predicted the failure to oust the
Sandinista regime would lead to increased Soviet influence in the
region and embroil the United States directly in military action to
save nascent democracies in El Salvador and Guatemala.
   Administration policymakers say they may share some of the blame
for the failure of the Contra policy, but say it will be a major
dilemma facing the next occupant of the White House.
   ``Perhaps a new administration will have a different policy
initiative toward all of Central America,'' said one senior
administration official, speaking only on condition of anonymity.
``Perhaps it will be able to sell a program in a way we could never
do. We have not done a very good job of convincing the American
people.''
   While U.S. policy toward the region remains adrift over the next
few months, the region is likely to take another run at a solution.
The presidents of the five Central American countries _ Nicaragua,
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras _ are talking about
the possibility of a summit meeting in San Salvador just before the
Nov. 14 start of an Organization of American States General
Assembly.
   Complicating their efforts is the continued presence of
thousands of armed rebels along Honduras' border with Nicaragua, a
presence that makes Honduran President Jose Azcona increasingly
nervous. Azcona has suggested a United Nations force be stationed
in the region to keep the borders clear of rebels. Something has to
be done with the Contras, but nobody seems to know exactly what.
   The Contras themselves remain splintered over what to do next.
With U.S. refusal to provide new military aid, some hard-liners
believe the rebels should look to other countries to provide it.
One moderate member of the rebel political directorate, Alfredo
Cesar, wants to return to Nicaragua and work for reform through
peaceful political and diplomatic means.
   ``I don't blame them in the least,'' Edwards said. ``It's
natural that there would be disagreements. They've had their
friends killed, without having achieved anything. (The Sandinistas)
still put people in jail, break up peaceful demonstrations, close
down the press whenever they feel like it. They're still getting
military aid from the Russians. Nothing has changed.''

   Aides held a mirror above Emperor Hirohito's head
Sunday so he could view the full moon, a millennium-old harvest
tradition, palace officials said. They said the ailing emperor was
in good spirits.
   The 87-year-old emperor has joined members of the imperial
family every year to celebrate the Oct. 23 event.
   In London, news reports said British rock guitarist Eric Clapton
has taken out a $105,000 insurance policy in case his concert tour
of Japan, planned for early November, is canceled in deference to
the emperor. The Sun newspaper said Clapton will receive more than
$1.75 million from the policy if the tour is canceled.
   Many other concerts, festivals and other events have been
canceled in Japan because of Hirohito's illness.
   On Sunday, the moon was not visible directly from his bed, so
Hirohito viewed its reflection in a mirror, palace spokesman Kenji
Maeda said.
   Earlier Sunday, Hirohito's blood pressure rose to its highest
level since Sept. 19, when he fell ill.
   Maeda said Hirohito's blood pressure was 174 over 76 in the
afternoon but declined at night to 160 over 78. A normal reading is
about 120 over 80.
   The emperor was in good spirits and chatted with aides and
family members, Maeda said.
   He said Hirohito's anemia had improved slightly following recent
blood transfusions. The emperor has received nearly 25 pints of
blood since Sept. 19.
   The emperor received no transfusions on Sunday, Maeda said.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny news reports
the emperor has cancer in his upper digestive system.
   Hirohito has eaten only a few spoonfuls of porridge in the past
month and has been fed intravenously.

Monday crosses a jukebox with digital technology for a service that
allows consumers to custom-make their own music cassettes from a
variety of artists and labels.
   The new gadget has drawn mixed reviews from some major record
companies, which fear it may cut into album sales, and some are not
participating.
   Customers can select from up to 2,500 songs. A store clerk
punches in the buyer's selections, in the order chosen, and the
customer gets a 90-minute tape with up to 25 songs. The cost is 50
cents to $1.25 a song.
   The store's copy of the music is recorded on an optical disk,
allowing all those songs to be copied onto the tape in just five
minutes.
   Personics System Co. of Menlo Park, Calif., hopes to have as
many as 15,000 songs available eventually in its monthly catalogue.
   Personics is introducing 25 systems at record stores in
California and hopes to expand to other areas of the country.
   ``Personics from day one will offer a vast constellation of
musical artists ... You will be able to personalize music like
never before,'' said Charles Garvin, founder and president of
Personics.
   The Personics system will give smaller record stores pressed for
space a deeper offering of songs.
   The price includes fees and royalties for artists and their
labels, who otherwise wouldn't get a penny if consumers made their
own tapes from radio or friends' records.
   Personics has attracted at least 30 labels, including Polygram,
MCA, Warner-Elektra-Atlantic, Chrysalis and others.
   Personics has not yet been able to attract giant CBS Records,
home of Bruce Springsteen and Michael Jackson, or the BMG group,
formerly RCA Records. A&M Records, with such artists as Sting and
Janet Jackson, is not interested, spokeswoman Diana Baron said
Friday.
   Record companies are cautious about Personics because sales of
single songs could cut into album sales, said Michael Greene,
president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
   ``For the most part the idea is a good one,'' said Greene, who
praised ``any system that would cut into (illegal) home taping and
give artists their royalties.'' Billions of dollars a year are lost
worldwide through record pirating and home recording, industry
experts have estimated.
   ``The problem I'm concerned with is what happens when people go
into a record store and start doing compilation tapes of hits?''
Greene said. ``The artist may have other material in the album they
consider necessary for a listener to understand what they are doing
musically.''
   Garvin said Personics' test marketing in two stores showed it
brought royalties from ``new consumers who would not have been
album buyers, and people who would not have bought the music at
all, but probably would have home-taped it.''
   Growing record companies like 6-year-old Enigma are making
available their entire catalogue.
   ``It's another way to sell songs, like K-Tel compilations,''
said Enigma co-founder William Hein, who said Personics could be a
way to rekindle the dying market for single releases.
   Other companies are more cautious about the system, which took
$8 million and five years to develop and market.
   Capitol Records, one of Personics principal owners, has made
available its current single releases and older albums, for
instance, but not material from its current albums unreleased as
singles.
   And while the Capitol Beach Boy catalogue will be available, the
legal tangle surrounding the Beatles' music means they won't
immediately be in the Personics catalogue, said Personics board
member Elliot Goldman.
   ``The industry has a right to be skeptical,'' Garvin said. ``But
I think we have convinced everyone this is an effort of, by and for
the music business for continued control over its product.''

<HEAD>Police Say Hacker Tapped Into U.S., Other Systems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   London police said Sunday that they tracked down
an unemployed computer hacker who tapped into military, commercial
and university systems in Europe and the United States over several
years.
   They said the man was questioned about alleged attempts to
blackmail a computer company but that there was not enough evidence
to pursue the matter.
   ``He was officially cautioned about that but, as he wasn't
charged with anything, we are not identifying him,'' said a
spokeswoman at Scotland Yard.
   A Scotland Yard statement said only that the man was 23 and out
of work. It said the inquiry by its Serious Crimes Squad lasted
five weeks.
   The Sunday Telegraph, which broke the story, said the man was
connected with an ``international ring of computer hackers who have
penetrated the electronic information systems of more than 200
sensitive military and commercial establishments.''
   It said the computer systems penetrated included NASA, the U.S.
Nuclear Defense Agency, the British Defense Ministry, ``as well as
those of American defense establishments and suppliers.''
   The weekly said American security experts were going to London
to examine papers found during the police investigation which gave
details of hacking activities over five years.
   The newspaper said the man used computers on the University of
Surrey campus at Guildford, 30 miles southwest of London, and had
not committed any offense under British law.
   It said the man's hacking included finding out details of
people's financial accounts and that his motive appeared to have
been the ``pleasure of beating the system.''
   It reported he had contacts with unidentified hacking clubs in
the United States and with one in West Germany ``which specializes
in gaining access to military systems. But there is no suggestion
that he tried to disclose secrets to foreign countries,'' the
report added.
   The newspaper said the alleged blackmail attempt originated with
a request to a large computer firm for a $5,250 fee to be shown how
its equipment had been used to tap different computer systems.
   The firm went to the police, who traced the hacker to one of
Surrey University's 900 terminals and trapped the man when the
university collaborated in setting up a terminal programed to
monitor external computer calls, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Chinese Media Lavishes Praise On General Who Stood Up to Mao</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's top newspapers Sunday heaped unusually
lavish praise on former Defense Minister Peng Dehuai, the peasant
general purged from the Communist Party for criticizing Mao
Tse-tung's ruinous economic program.
   In the People's Daily, the party's main organ, elder statesman
Bo Yibo expressed regret for not joining Peng in standing up to
Mao's Great Leap Forward of 1958, the mobilization of peasants into
self-sufficient ``people's communes.''
   Several leading newspapers also carried an article by President
Yang Shangkun, praising the publication of Peng's selected writings
on military affairs to mark the 90th anniversary of his birth.
   The prominent tributes to Peng, who died four years before he
was officially rehabilitated in 1978, may have been intended to
encourage people to fight record-high inflation and rampant
corruption after 10 years of market-oriented economic reform.
   The party has launched a campaign against officials who have
illegally profited from China's modernization and open-door
policies and, in an effort to control inflation, has at least
temporarily halted moves to reduce central planning and increase
market freedom.
   ``Our economic reforms have reached a critical stage, hope and
difficulties exist together,'' Bo said at the end of his
8,000-plus-character article that covered most of the back page of
the party newspaper.
   ``All party members ought to carry forward (Peng's)
revolutionary spirit of pioneering and seeking truths'' to develop
China, said Bo, an 80-year-old former vice premier who now holds
the largely honorary post of vice chairman of the party Central
Advisory Commission.
   Bo's article, titled ``Unforgettable Recollections,'' also
appeared to attack Mao by praising one of his most prominent
critics.
   Although Chinese leaders openly acknowledge Mao's mistakes in
launching the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the Cultural
Revolution of 1966-76, he has not suffered bitter official attacks
in a manner similar to the Soviet criticism of Stalin.
   Peng was purged from the party in September 1959, shortly after
his attack on Mao's policies. Peng died Nov. 29, 1974, and was
officially rehabilitated in 1978, two years after Mao died.

<HEAD>The Message: Bush Ad People Outflank Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>An AP News Analysis</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush is running an
advertising campaign so successful that it has overshadowed news
events and swayed voters in a near-vacuum that Democrat Michael
Dukakis only now is moving to fill.
   With the Nov. 8 election little more than two weeks away,
Dukakis went on the air during the weekend with strong
counterpunches to a months-old Bush offensive that raked him over
the coals _ often inaccurately _ and obliterated any momentum the
Massachusetts governor had leaving the Democratic convention in
July.
   From the first commercials filled with children and warmth,
balloons and adulation, to stinging ads attacking Dukakis to a
series of foreign affairs spots stressing the vice president's
experience, Bush's ad people sought to transform his image from
wimp to strong yet sensitive leader.
   They have not made a false move.
   At the same time, Bush's ads have battered Dukakis to the point
that voters who once viewed him as a competent, innovative governor
or _ at worst _ an unknown, tend to see the Democratic nominee as
soft on crime, weak on defense and questionable on the environment.
   Dukakis' own advertising got off to a late and shaky start,
which was an unexpected bonus for Bush and his highly experienced
media team led by Roger Ailes.
   ``If Roger Ailes was working for Dukakis, he would be the
front-runner,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Texas
professor specializing in political communication.
   Jamieson and other experts say that, in contrast to Bush, the
Dukakis media campaign has been damagingly out of sync. Television
viewers saw nothing that countered Bush's attacks on crime and the
environment.
   Instead, they say, there were celebratory Atlanta convention
scenes a month later, and obscure ``packaging of George Bush''
commercials when voters needed to know more about Dukakis and his
record.
   In lengthy television appearances between now and Election Day,
Dukakis hopes to publicize his record and persuade voters to take
one more look at him _ and Bush _ before they make up their minds.
   On Friday, Dukakis came out slugging. He began airing a series
of blistering TV ads during the weekend in which he appears in
shirtsleeves to accuse Bush of broadcasting claims that are ``full
of lies'' and ``dragging the truth into the gutter'' about the
Democratic nominee's positions on crime and defense.
   He personally goes on the attack against Bush and his running
mate, Dan Quayle, mentioning both by name. One TV ad savages the
vice president's anti-drug leadership, showing scenes of children
buying drugs and Bush meeting with Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
   ``Dukakis has re-entered the campaign dialogue doing the job
that a candidate is supposed to do _ engage the claims of the other
candidate and when they are distorted, point that out,'' said
Jamieson.
   ``It's a good move in the ninth hour. It would have been a
better move in the first hour,'' she said, expressing a view shared
by Dukakis running mate Lloyd Bentsen.
   ``If he'd done this as soon as the attacks went on the air, he'd
be ahead in the polls right now,'' Jamieson said.
   For his part, Bush has used TV ads to reinforce the ``I share
your values, he doesn't'' campaign message he has delivered in
stump speeches across the country.
   The results have been dramatic. Bush started with high negative
ratings and Dukakis with high positive ratings among voters. Recent
polls show those ratings are reversed.
   Pollster Lou Harris said last week that 60 percent of nearly
2,000 likely voters surveyed by his organization remembered a Bush
ad attacking the Massachusetts prison furlough program. Most found
it ``too negative and unfair,'' but they also said it was effective.
   ``The Bush commercials have had an enormous impact,'' Harris
said. ``Really more than the debates, more than anything else, they
have determined the set of the election up until now.''
   Julian Cantor, a political advertising expert at the University
of Oklahoma, said Dukakis has reduced crime and strengthened the
police in Massachusetts and received a national award from a crime
victims' assistance group, yet he seems to be a willing victim
himself.
   ``He's been an effective governor in terms of crime. The public
is being left with a very distorted perception,'' Cantor said.
``It's Bush's fault for creating the distortion, but it's Dukakis'
fault for not setting the record straight.''
   Dukakis' endorsement by the League of Conservation Voters was
overshadowed by Bush's personal appearance in Boston Harbor and
follow-up ads accusing the governor of failing to rid the harbor of
pollution, Cantor says.
   ``The Dukakis campaign failed to get out front on the (harbor)
issue or respond to the charge rapidly after it was made,'' he
said. ``If you don't respond, the public accepts the charge as
valid.''
   Dukakis' weak media performance has been attributed to friction
and confusion among his advertising people, and a misguided belief
that he could sit on a 17-point lead in the polls and wait for Bush
to self-destruct.
   Those days appear to have vanished with Dukakis' belated
realization that he must join the fray and cut through what one of
his aides, Leslie Dach, termed a Bush campaign of ``labels, fog and
deceptions.''

<HEAD>Baltimore Symphony Strike Follows National Tradition of Militancy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Baltimore Symphony Orchestra players laid
down their instruments in favor of picket signs a month ago, they
were following a long tradition of militancy among symphony
orchestra musicians.
   In the past 10 years, the 31 major orchestras in the United
States have struck or been locked out 28 times, according to the
American Symphony Orchestra League.
   ``Musicians in general traditionally have been the most militant
of the various entertainment groups,'' said Leonard Leibowitz, an
attorney who represents Baltimore Symphony members and the American
Federation of Musicians. ``Symphony musicians in particular have
probably been one of the most militant.''
   The Baltimore orchestra has gone on strike three times and been
locked out by management once in the past 20 years, said John
Gidwitz, symphony executive director.
   The San Francisco Symphony walked out for 12 days in January and
the Utah Symphony Orchestra struck for nearly a month this fall.
   Leibowitz attributed the musicians' feistiness to several
things, including a belief that they should be compensated for the
years they have spent, many since childhood, devoted to their art,
and their view that working in the orchestra is a career, not a
stepping stone to individual acclaim.
   ``For us, the big break is to crack a major symphony
orchestra,'' said Charles Underwood, BSO violinist.
   Gidwitz attributed the strikes to a history of inadequate wages
that musicians reversed by walking off the job.
   ``I hope and guardedly believe as musicians start to attain more
reasonable salaries we will collectively find less disruptive ways
of settling labor contracts,'' he said.
   Utah Symphony Orchestra executive director Paul Chummers blamed
``unrealistic expectations'' by musicians, who he said don't
realize the precarious financial state in which many orchestras
exist.
   The symphony league lists 13 orchestras that are in financial
trouble, including Phoenix, Denver, Detroit, Houston and Columbus,
Ohio.
   Chummers said symphonies commonly earn half their costs from
ticket sales and depend on donations for the rest.
   A symphony's labor problems rarely alienate audiences. The
Baltimore symphony has not lost community support during the
strike, Gidwitz said. Unless a strike lasts the entire season,
patrons usually return quickly, Leibowitz said.
   The Baltimore contract expired Sept. 17. Informal contact
between both sides continues but no negotiations have been
scheduled.
   In San Francisco, musicians walked out during the last two
contract negotiations, this year and for two weeks in the 1985-86
season.
   ``Sometimes it seems you need a strike just to get the other
side serious about negotiating,'' said Tom Hemphill, chairman of
the San Francisco Symphony players' committee.
   For the BSO, the strike follows four years of harmony between
management and musicians _ a relationship that has created a
world-class reputation, both sides said. Broadcasting and recording
contracts and European tours brought good reviews, and a $40
million fund-raiser recently put the orchestra on sound financial
footing.
   Because of that, the dissonance that creeps into both sides'
rhetoric is almost always balanced with at least a token note of
respect for the adversary.
   The 96 players walked off the stage after their Sept. 23
performance, rejecting management's final offer of a $4.2 million,
three-year package that would have raised salaries by $25 a week in
the first year, from $770 to $795.
   The union was seeking $1,015 weekly by the end of the 1988-89
season. The orchestra offered $980 by the end of the 1991-92
season, said Richard Hafetz, attorney for symphony management.
   The union wants to be paid the average of its peer orchestras,
including so-called second-tier groups such as San Francisco, St.
Louis and Houston.
   Management said its offer would bring salaries in line with the
group, because it totals more than the contract Houston players
recently signed. The offer is about $200 less a week than San
Francisco musicians earn.

<TEXT>
   Ferdinand Marcos claims he is relieved that he
has finally been indicted by the United States and will have a
chance to defend himself in court, but the deposed Philippine
president has plenty of other legal troubles.
   Besides New York, where he was indicted Friday, Marcos is the
target of investigations or lawsuits in Honolulu, Los Angeles,
Seattle, Washington, D.C., Alexandria, Va., and his homeland.
   Most center on his enormous wealth and influence, how he got it,
and how he used it after being exiled to Hawaii in 1986.
   But there are also allegations of Marcos involvement in the
slayings of two opponents of his regime in Seattle in 1981, torture
of opponents in his homeland and bribery in the sale of military
equipment to his government.
   John Bartko, an attorney for Marcos in San Francisco, called the
New York indictments ``probably the most complex case every filed
in U.S. courts.''
   Marcos' trial ``would be, without doubt, one of longest and most
ardurous criminal proceedings in U.S. history. And they (the
indictments) are just one facet of an incredibly complex case.''
   Marcos, 71; his wife, Imelda, 59; and six others were indicted
on federal racketeering charges, accused of looting more than $100
million from the Philippines to buy art and real estate in New York
City. They were also charged with defrauding lending institutions
of more than $165 million in the purchase and financing of the real
estate.
   ``Paradoxical as it may seem, Imelda and I welcome the
opportunity to show the whole world that these allegations of
dishonesty and criminal activity cannot be proven by our
accusers,'' Marcos said in a statement. ``We are confident that we
will be vindicated.''
   But as his lawyers prepare their defense, other investigations
continue.
   Dante B. Fascell, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, said Saturday that Marcos has been subpoenaed to appear
before the Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcomittee. The
Virginian-Pilot and Ledger-Star newspapers of Norfolk, Va.,
reported the subcommittee was investigating allegations that Marcos
funneled millions of dollars into the 1980 and 1984 campaigns of
President Reagan and Vice President George Bush.
   Richard Hibey, another Marcos attorney, confirmed that Marcos
has been subpoenaed but did not say whether he would appear.
   Last August in Seattle, a federal judge ruled that Marcos and
his wife must stand trial in a lawsuit to determine whether they
were involved in the 1981 slayings of two anti-Marcos union
officials there.
   Marcos claimed head-of-state immunity, but U.S. District Judge
Barbara Rothstein ruled he lost that protection after fleeing to
Hawaii in February 1986 during the civilian-military revolt that
catapulted Corazon Aquino to power. The ruling has been appealed
and the case is expected to be tried next year.
   Federal grand juries in Honolulu and Alexandria, Va., have been
investigating Marcos since shortly after his arrival in the United
States.
   The Honolulu investigation reportedly focuses on an alleged 1987
plot to return Marcos to power, which was thwarted when Philippine
officials here alerted Aquino, and on an arms-smuggling plot
allegedly hatched by Marcos.
   The Virginia investigation involves possible bribery in
U.S.-financed sales of military equipment to the Philippines during
Marcos' 20-year rule.
   In the Philippines, 39 suits seeking to collect nearly $100
billion are pending against Marcos.
   No criminal charges have been filed there because Marcos has
said he would demand his constitutional right to return to his
homeland and face his accusers in court. Mrs. Aquino has refused to
allow Marcos' return.
   ``Mr. Marcos will face criminal indictments in the Philippines
eventually,'' said Tomas Gomez, Philippine Consul in Honolulu.
``The long road to retribution and restitution has begun.''
   Philippine officials, including Aquino, hailed the U.S.
indictments because they could hasten recovery of his alleged
``hidden wealth.'' The Philippine government claims much of that
wealth is sheltered in secret Swiss bank accounts. Swiss
authorities had indicated they would wait for indictments _ not
civil proceedings _ before releasing information about frozen
Marcos accounts.
   Besides New York, the other main U.S. main battleground in the
``hidden wealth'' hunt is California, where a $56.4 billion
Philippine suit led to the freezing by a federal judge of more than
$215 million in alleged Marcos cash, real estate and other assets,
including Swiss accounts. That suit has not been resolved.
   Also unresolved is a $120 million suit filed in March 1986 by
the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of alleged victims of
torture and arbitrary arrest by the Marcos regime.
   In Honolulu, the Marcoses are being sued by a Philippine
treasure hunter who claims they stole from him a treasure worth $60
billion that included a 2,000-pound gold statue of Buddha. Marcos
called the suit ``fantasy.''

<HEAD>State Survey Asks Welfare Mother Sex Questions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state paternity survey that asks for
intimate details of a welfare mother's sex life is so intrusive
it's offensive, a legal aid lawyer says.
   One federal official said such surveys are discouraged.
   Human Services Department officials confirm that the survey asks
women for the exact dates when sexual relations between them and
the childrens' alleged fathers began and ended, according to the
Charleston Sunday Gazette-Mail.
   Other questions include: ``Is there anyone else who could
possibly be the father of the child? Did the child's father ever
suggest an abortion? How often did you have sexual relations with
him?''
   ``Why don't I just put a video camera in my bedroom,'' one
unidentified woman complained to the newspaper.
   Human Services Commissioner Reginia Lipscomb said the survey is
used to identify the child's father and is federally approved.
   A department employee said the questionnaire does not ask even
more personal questions that might turn up later if the matter went
to court _ such as details of the mother's menstrual cycle, her use
of contraceptives, and the names of other sexual partners.
   Lipscomb said the form was mailed to women in Kanawha County,
which includes Charleston, who collect or have collected Aid to
Families with Dependent Children and whose last names begin with
letters K to Z. She said she did not know how many of the forms
were sent.
   ``My problem with the questionnaire is that it did not seem to
be reasonably limited to the cases where information would be
needed,'' said Bruce Perrone of the Legal Aid Society of Charleston.
   ``It was being sent out in a blanket format to all sorts of
women. I find that grossly intrusive and offensive. There should be
some screening procedure for who this is sent to.''
   Lipscomb said she has no problem with the survey and thinks the
only mistake the department made was to send it through the mail.
She declined to comment about specific questions.
   Lipscomb said federal law requires the state to learn the
identity of fathers of nearly all children being raised by mothers
who collect public assistance. The state then tries to collect
child support from those fathers.
   She said the survey was adapted from other federal forms and
received federal approval.
   A federal official disagreed.
   George Hurley of the Mid-Atlantic Region III of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services said his office does not
get involved with individual state questionnaires and even
discourages the use of paternity questionnaires.
   ``We are concerned about their use and wonder if they are really
necessary,'' Hurley said.
   In 1982, a federal judge ordered the California Department of
Human Services to interview clients in person when trying to
establish paternity. The judge also told the department to develop
separate sets of questions, so that extremely personal questions
were not asked in cases where paternity was not in question.
   Paternal support is a problem in West Virginia. A Congressional
report says fewer men in West Virginia pay support for their
children than in almost all other states.

<HEAD>Humphrey Legacy Hasn't Given Son Free Ride To Senate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The memory of Hubert H. Humphrey has not
given his son, the Democratic Senate nominee, a free ride to
Washington.
   Hubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey III has trailed Sen. Dave
Durenberger, R-Minn., throughout the fall campaign, though
Democratic Party strategists say Humphrey might score an upset on
Nov. 8.
   Humphrey also has lagged by at least a 2-1 margin in fund
raising for a contest that could cost more than $10 million.
   ``There's no question the spirit of Hubert Humphrey has played
an enormous role'' in the Minnesota race, said Republican
consultant Bob Anderson. ``His (Skip's) name recognition and his
support, his entry into the ... party has come because of his
relationship to his father.''
   Jesse Jackson, in a campaign appearance last week, recalled that
Humphrey's father led the fight for civil rights at the 1948
Democratic National Convention.
   ``The acorn does not fall far from the tree,'' Jackson said.
   Skip Humphrey anticipated Republican claims that he would trade
on the reputation of his father, who served in the Senate from 1949
to 1964 and again from 1971 until his death in January 1978. The
elder Humphrey also served as Lyndon Johnson's vice president and
was the unsuccessful Democratic presidential nominee in 1968.
   ``I bear a famous name, made famous not by me but by my father
and my mother,'' said Humphrey, 46, when he entered the Senate race
in February.
   Humphrey's mother, Muriel Humphrey Brown, was appointed to
succeed his father and served in the Senate until November 1978,
when Durenberger, 54, was elected to succeed her.
   Humphrey says he is running on his own record as Minnesota
attorney general since 1983 and as a former state senator.
   ``I will not trade on what I have not earned,'' Humphrey said.
``I will build on what I have been given.''
   Republicans contend that his magic name is Humphrey's biggest
asset. After 10 years in the state Senate, Humphrey won his first
statewide race for attorney general in 1982 with 1.08 million
votes, the top vote-getter in that election.
   But if his name has helped, being the son of the famous ``Happy
Warrior'' of a generation of Democratic politics also has been a
burden.
   ``As he would be the first to admit, his father was one of a
kind, and you can't help but come up wanting in a comparison such
as that,'' said D.J. Leary, a political analyst and former adviser
to the elder Humphrey.
   One Republican wag has suggested that if Humphrey presented an
opening, Durenberger could retort: ``I knew your father, and you're
no Hubert Humphrey.''
   If Humphrey has been reluctant to invoke his father's name,
Durenberger has been almost eager to do so.
   After Humphrey aired his first ad attacking Durenberger last
spring, the incumbent retorted in a commercial that the attack was
unbefitting the Humphrey name.
   ``Skip's mudslinging doesn't fit in Minnesota,'' Durenberger
said. ``Skip's great, late father never would have started a
campaign this way. Skip's father knew Minnesota.''
   But it was a different Minnesota that Humphrey's father knew,
when the state had a reputation for liberalism. In a Minnesota Poll
released last week by the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, only 29
percent of the respondents said they were liberal, while 53 percent
described themselves as conservatives and 14 percent said they were
moderates.
   Durenberger survived a troubled period in his personal life. He
has reconciled with his wife after they were separated from
February 1985 to October 1986. During the separation, Durenberger,
who is Roman Catholic, moved into a Christian retreat house for
several months.
   He also was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after a
shouting match with a police officer at Boston's Logan Airport in a
dispute over a taxi.
   Each candidate has retained a high-priced East Coast consultant
to help draw comparisons between them in an increasingly negative
TV ad war.
   Humphrey's ads have accused Durenberger of voting to increase
defense spending and cut Medicare, spurning funds for anti-drug
programs while voting to send foreign aid to countries ``that
actually sell illegal drugs here,'' and helping write legislation
that forced rural hospitals to close.
   Durenberger has responded in kind. A recent Durenberger ad says
that although Humphrey's most important job as attorney general was
to fight crime, ``violent crime in Minnesota has mushroomed'' since
he took office.

<TEXT>
   The coast guard was searching Sunday for a
British teen-ager and a schoolteacher missing after a collision
between a Greek cruise ship and an Italian freighter.
   A merchant marine spokesman said there was little chance of
finding Vivienne Barley, 14, and Bernard Butt, 41, after Friday's
accident. The teacher had originally been reported safe.
   ``We don't think anyone could have survived so long,'' said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The 6,300-ton cruise ship Jupiter with 486 British
schoolchildren and their teachers aboard collided with the
5,500-ton Italian freighter Adige in Piraeus harbor near Athens,
killing two Greek seamen and injuring more than 60 people. Butt, a
history teacher at Bloxwith School near the town of Walsall, about
80 miles northwest of London, failed to board any of the charter
flights taking survivors home on Saturday, according to a spokesman
for Schools Abroad, the organizer of the trip.
   A British Embassy spokesman said the girl, of Sutton Coldfield
in central England, was last seen before the accident and ``must
probably be presumed dead.''
   The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said Butt at first ``was
thought to have wandered off in a state of shock but now it seems
that he may also be missing at sea.''
   Anthony Greedy, a spokesman for Epirotiki Lines, the cruise ship
owners, said Butt had been reported ``seen helping the children in
a hospital in the early hours of Saturday but that story later
turned out to be wrong.''
   In England, Butt's elder brother Neville said, ``I think it is
now very likely he has perished.''
   Only one victim of the collision was still in the hospital
Sunday. She was identified as Mrs. W. Howard, 68, who was in stable
condition with abdominal injuries.
   Greek officials blamed the Italian freighter for the accident
and arrested its skipper, Capt. Flavio Caminale, on charges of
manslaughter and negligence. Italian officials denied the freighter
was at fault.
   The Adige, which was transporting a cargo of automobiles, was
preparing to dock at Piraeus at the time of the collision.
   ``We radioed the Italian ship because we realized it was coming
straight for us and told them to reverse. They said they would but
the next thing we knew they'd rammed us,'' Kyriakos Moustakis, the
Jupiter's second-in-command, told reporters.
   Capt. Caminale said his ship, which was awaiting a Greek pilot,
was not moving at the time of the accident. He said the Greek ship
veered sharply as it approached the Adige and ``in so turning ...
(the captain) struck my prow.''

<HEAD>Bush's `Thousand Points of Light' Takes On Many Meanings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush wasn't sure at first exactly what
it meant, either, that line about the thousand points of light, but
aides said he liked the music of the phrase.
   Since Bush speechwriter Peggy Noonan penned it for Bush's
convention acceptance speech in New Orleans, the points-of-light
line has taken on a life of its own in the 1988 presidential
campaign.
   Noonan, a former speechwriter for President Reagan, also came up
with the ``kinder, gentler nation'' phrase that the Republican
nominee uses frequently.
   Bush aides say the ``thousand points of light'' line, which has
evolved into a description of volunteer and charity efforts that
supplement government assistance, was first a little baffling to
the vice president.
   Even later, Bush told audiences he sympathized with those who
weren't sure what the phrase meant.
   One of those was Democratic rival Michael Dukakis, who expressed
he was puzzled by the phrase during his first debate with Bush in
late September. ``I don't know what that means,'' Dukakis said.
   Even so, Dukakis built on the phrase, telling audiences that he
wasn't for the 1,000 points of light but for ``240 million points
of light,'' a reference to the U.S. population.
   Bush occasionally has scrambled the phrase, calling it ``1,000
points of life.'' And, in an interview with The New York Times,
Bush referred to ``a thousand shining hills.''
   ``I can't do poetry,'' he said.
   The phrase blinked on again the other night at the Al Smith
charity dinner in New York City which both presidential candidates
attended.
   Bush told a joke on himself. He said he and his wife, Barbara,
had gone to the movies the night before and had asked an usher for
help finding a seat in the darkened theater.
   The usher declined, telling Bush: ``You're the one with the
1,000 points of light.''
   In the same speech, Bush gave an admiring nod to a variation on
the theme by syndicated Washington Post cartoonist Herblock, who
drew a beer-drinking bar patron telling a companion that he
endorsed Bush's pledge of ``one thousand pints of Lite.''
   Sometimes the line loses a bit of its luster, as it did during
the second presidential debate at Los Angeles in mid-October.
   Bush's media consultant, Roger Ailes, was pacing nervously
backstage while he and other senior campaign advisers watched the
Bush-Dukakis encounter on television.
   The hefty Ailes tripped over an electrical cord, bringing a lamp
crashing to the floor and shattering.
   ``Well, that means there's only 999 points of light,'' said
campaign adviser Stuart Spencer.
   The Secret Service had concerns whether Bush himself would
become a thousand points of light when he spoke during a severe
lightning storm at a Holocaust memorial in Skokie, Ill.
   Bush's security detail urged him to stay inside but Bush decided
to venture out to greet a crowd waiting in the rain, with bolts of
lightning flashing around them.
   Before he left, security agents made him slip into thick,
thigh-high rubber boots borrowed from the local fire department. He
also was given strict advice: under no circumstances touch the
microphone.

<TEXT>
   Security was tightened Sunday at a theater showing
``The Last Temptation of Christ'' after a fire closed another
cinema running the controversial film and injured 10 people.
   The fire Saturday night at the St. Michel cinema on the Left
Bank began as patrons were leaving and apparently started in a
theater seat. The blaze heavily damaged the building, the site of
religious protests against the film.
   On Sunday, security guards were posted outside the Gaumont
Champs-Elysees theater, the only other Paris house showing the film.
   The blaze was under investigation by the criminal brigade of the
city police department, the unit that investigates cases of
suspected arson.
   Paris Archbishop Jean-Marie Lustiger condemned the fire and told
those who have been demonstrating against the film, ``You believe
you are defending Christ, but you are doing exactly the contrary.''
   ``You are not behaving as Christians but as enemies of Christ,''
said Lustiger, speaking during a break at a conference in Lourdes.
   The Communist Party in Paris called for a demonstration Monday
outside the St. Michel cinema to protest attempts to inhibit
artistic freedom.
   Jean Desandre, a spokesman for the Gaumont Champs-Elysees, said
management had instructed employees to be ``vigilant from the day
the film opened.'' He said the increased security was ``necessary''
and that people buying tickets to the film were being searched in
the theater lobby.
   A sign posted at the front of the theater said, ``Because of
provocative incidents by unscrupulous spectators, the public is
advised that a search will be conducted before the entrance to the
cinema.''
   The film, an adaptation of the 1955 Nikos Kazanthakis novel, led
to protests by Christian groups elsewhere in Europe and in the
United States.
   Some Christians have been offended by the film's portrayal of
Jesus Christ as a human being with passions and weaknesses. The
film includes a short scene in which Christ imagines having sex
with Mary Magdalene.

   More than 1,700 people demonstrated peacefully
Sunday against the planned expansion of New Tokyo International
Airport at Narita.
   The demonstrators, carrying banners bearing slogans such as
``Don't Expand!'' marched about two miles from the airport, said a
police official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The official said 9,000 riot police were mobilized to protect
the airport, which is 40 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   The demonstrators oppose government plans to exproporiate
farmland to build an additional runway at the airport, which opened
in 1978.

   The Moose Lodge seemed too obvious a stop, so
the meandering mammal headed for the high school in search of peace
and quiet.
   But authorities decided the school wasn't an appropriate stop
either for the visiting moose cow, which was trying to make its way
through town and away from all those excited people with cameras.
   ``We were afraid, because at the school there are all kinds of
windows; if she had taken a jump, she would probably have had to
have been destroyed,'' said police officer John Saw in this town of
4,800.
   So police and state wildlife officers blocked off traffic and,
following the loose moose on foot, gradually herded it back to the
vicinity of the Moose Lodge in this town in the forests and lakes
of northeastern Minnesota.
   That sounds easier than it was. Sometimes curious people got in
the moose's path and it veered away.
   ``Heck, nobody's seen a moose for years and years in the city of
Ely,'' Saw said.
   Eventually the moose made it safely across a highway and a golf
course, past the Moose Lodge, away from all those annoying people
and into the deep woods, said Al Heidebrink of the state Department
of Natural Resources.
   Heidebrink used to work in Grand Marais, over on Lake Superior.
Moose aren't as uncommon there, he said, and people usually just
ignore them while they find the road out of town on their own.

   Sikh extremists shot and killed 10
people in Punjab state, including a Communist Party official,
police said Sunday.
   Also Sunday, a news agency reported that a top Sikh radical had
drowned.
   Police said one of the victims of the latest Sikh separatist
violence was Swaran Singh, a member of the pro-Moscow Communist
Party of India.
   Singh was fatally shot in his village in Amritsar on Saturday
night, police said. The motive for the killing was not known, but
Sikh radicals fighting for an independent Sikh nation in Punjab
have killed Communist Party members in the state because they are
opposed to the Sikh separatist demand.
   United News of India reported the drowning of Gurvinder Singh, a
top Sikh radical who headed the Gurdaspur district unit of the
Babbar Khalsa, one of the groups leading the separatist campaign.
The report did now say where or when Singh died, only that the body
was identified Sunday.
   The other nine killings blamed on Sikh radicals occurred across
Punjab.
   The latest slayings brought the death toll blamed on Sikh
extremists in Punjab this year to 2,120.
   Sikhs, a religious minority in India, allege they are
discriminated by the Hindus, the country's religious majority. The
radicals want a separate nation, but moderate Sikhs want more
political autonomy for their rich farming state.

<TEXT>
   Astronauts from the shuttle Discovery
will ride in vintage Corvettes once driven by speed-loving pioneers
in the nation's space program for a nostalgic parade Monday in this
Space Coast town.
   From 1967 to 1971, a Melbourne Chevrolet dealership gave
astronauts the cars of their choice for $1 a year under a
promotional lease.
   Almost all chose Corvettes and they were easily spotted. Each
was red, white or blue, with two stripes in the other patriotic
colors slashed across the hood and trunk.
   ``Being the hot-footed test pilots they were _ craving for speed
_ it was only natural for them to choose Corvettes,'' said Jim
Falkowski of Fort Lauderdale, who paid $25,000 for astronaut Gus
Grissom's 1967 convertible Corvette and has been offered $52,000
for it.
   Grissom, one of the seven original Mercury astronauts, drove the
car until he died in the Apollo 1 launch pad fire in 1967.
   A 1968 Corvette originally owned by astronaut Alan Shepard will
be used in Monday's parade, along with two 1988 Corvette
convertibles on loan from Jim Rathmann Chevrolet in Melbourne.
   The five-mile motorcade, from Patrick Air Force Base to a Cocoa
Beach motel, will be modeled after a half-dozen parades held in
Cocoa Beach for astronauts during the 1960s.
   Thousands of people lined the streets from the air base to Cape
Canaveral during those parades.
   ``It was like a big homecoming parade,'' said Bob Murkshe, Cocoa
Beach mayor from 1963 to 1972. ``The astronauts would ride in open
convertibles and people would line the streets and wave flags.
   ``We were all working in the space program then.''
   About 500,000 people watched the launching of Discovery on Sept.
28. The shuttle fleet had been grounded for 32 months since the
January 1986 explosion of the shuttle Challenger, which killed all
seven crew members aboard.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said Sunday
she hopes other countries will follow the United States' example in
indicting Ferdinand Marcos and help recover money Marcos allegedly
stole during his 20-year reign.
   Manila newspapers speculated the indictment may have been ``a
precondition'' to an accord signed in Washington regarding U.S.
military bases in the Philippines.
   The agreement signed last week allows Washington to keep six
military facilities in the Philippines until 1991 in exchange for
about $962 million.
   Mrs. Aquino made her statement during her weekly radio program
``Ask the President.''
   ``Because ... this happened in the United States, I hope other
countries where we hear of reports that Marcos also hid his wealth,
which is actually owned by the Filipino people, will help in the
swift recovery of these stolen assets,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   ``I think it is very obvious now that crime does not pay,'' she
added.
   Marcos, his wife and eight others were indicted Friday in New
York on charges they collaborated in amassing $103 million through
embezzlement, theft, bribes and kickbacks, funneling it through
secret bank accounts and buying real estate.
   The 71-year-old former president and his 59-year-old wife,
Imelda, also were charged with defrauding three U.S. lending
institutions of $165 million to buy and finance properties in the
United States.
   Marcos denied the charges.
   ``The indictment ... coming as it did at an uncannily short time
after the signing of the new ... accord on the military bases, is
triggering all sorts of questions, foremost of which are: Is the
timing merely coincidental or are the two developments related?,''
The Manila Standard said.
   The Philippine Daily Globe asked: ``Could a U.S. promise to step
up the prosecution of Mr. Marcos have been the real substance of a
`secret deal' that has been bruited about since the signing of the
accord?''
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, who negotiated the bases
agreement, denied linkage.
   ``I don't think the indictment had anything to do with the bases
agreement,'' he told reporters Friday.
   But Sen. Wigberto Tanada, a leading anti-bases opponent, said:
``It is a possibility.''
   Marcos has been living in Honolulu since the February 1986
civilian-military revolt that swept Mrs. Aquino to power.
   The Marcoses are restricted to the island of Oahu because of his
reported attempt last year to return to the Philippines. U.S.
officials are honoring a Philippine government request he not be
allowed to return.
   Marcos, the highest-ranking former foreign official ever
indicted in the United States, faces 20-year prison sentences if
found guilty on each count.
   Mrs. Aquino's government has accused the Marcoses of stealing up
to $10 billion in public and private assets during Marcos'
20-year-rule.

   Police said Sunday they
arrested a man with a mine within 500 feet from the minister of law
and order, who was opening a new police station in the black
township of Crossroads.
   Police said the arrest was made at 11:16 a.m. Saturday, shortly
after Adriaan Vlok arrived to open the police station in the
squatter camp outside Cape Town.
   The government tried several times to destroy Crossroads before
recently making it a legal township.
   Statements issued by the police and the Ministry of Law and
Order did not identify the man, who was arrested on a charge of
terrorism.
   Police said he was being treated at a hospital because he had
complained of dizziness after his arrest. Police said the event was
not reported on the day it happened because the investigation was
still continuing.
   The Ministry of Law and Order said two policemen arrested the
suspect ``about 150 meters from where the minister was officiating.
... The alleged terrorist, who was moving in the direction of the
new police station, was in possession of an SPM limpet mine'' and a
detonator.
   The statement said that a search of the suspect's living
quarters revealed documents of the African National Congress, the
outlawed guerrilla organization waging a sabotage and bombing
campaign to end the apartheid system of racial segregation and
white privilege.
   The ministry statement said two policemen in a patrol vehicle
spotted the man acting suspiciously, turned their car around and
chased the suspect. It said the man was carrying the mine and
detonator in a bag.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified a 17th
century Danish scientist who converted to Catholicism and served as
a bishop in predominantly Protestant Germany.
   During the solemn ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica, the pope
praised Niels Stensen as an example for scientists, missionaries
and Christians around the world.
   ``All his life, Niels Stensen tirelessly sought the truth,
scientific and religious, in the conviction that every discovery,
no matter how modest, marks a step ahead toward absolute truth,''
the pope said.
   ``A top scientist never satisfied with just hypothesis and
always in search of complete certainty, he was especially moved to
discover the ultimate reason for everything: God, who can't be
discovered with the most sophisticated instruments of science ...
but only through the science of the heart,'' the pope said.
   Stensen was born a Lutheran in Copenhagen in 1638. After
studying medicine in Holland, he moved to Florence, Italy and
converted to Catholicism in 1667.
   He was appointed bishop in Germany, where he died in Schwerin in
1686. He was buried in Florence's Basilica of St. Lorenzo.
   ``His mission in a predominantly Protestant country shows how
honesty, combined with distinction and discretion, can and should
establish those relations which facilitate mutual understanding,
love and unity,'' John Paul said.
   The pope said Stensen should serve as inspiration for Christians
living outside their native lands, ``in solitude or in places that
don't understand them.''
   The ceremony was concelebrated by 10 cardinals and bishops from
Italy, West Germany and Denmark. About 1,000 Danish pilgrims
attended.
   Beatification is a step toward possible sainthood in the Roman
Catholic Church.

   Omeir and Lumberto Campbell, Nicaragua's minister of state, are
part of a delegation that has been visiting Denmark, Norway,
Belgium and Britain to seek support for development projects. Both
men said the delegation had now decided to focus on aid for the
hurricane victims.
   Hurricane Joan tore across Nicaragua on Saturday with winds of
125 mph and torrential rains. Dozens of people were killed in the
storm.
   Nicaraguan radio reported the hurricane destroyed 90 percent of
the homes in Bluefields, a coastal city of 60,000 about 180 miles
east of the capital, Managua.
   Campbell and Omeir said the hurricane had destroyed the economy
of a region which has little infrastructure and was already
suffering serious economic problems.
   In Bluefields, where the main source of income is fishing,
Campbell said two fishing plants were blown down.
   The mayor said his wife, son and parents are in Bluefields and
that he last spoke to them on Wednesday because the hurricane cut
communications to the area.
   ``At first, since I have my family and friends and everyone at
home, I would like to be home,'' he said. ``But I realize going
home without some help means nothing.''
   Omeir said most of the 5,500 homes in Bluefields are modest
wooden homes built on stilts.
   ``Near the water side (the houses) were right in front of the
bay. So I can't imagine them still standing, those at least at the
front of the bay,'' he said.
   The largest building in Bluefields is the hospital. ``Let's hope
it's still standing,'' Omeir said.
   The delegation had planned to return to Nicaragua in the middle
of the week, but Omeir said the visit may be extended to continue
the appeal for aid.
   The Foreign Office said Britain, through its ambassador to
Nicargua, had donated $17,500 in cash to a relief organization in
Nicaragua.

   About 150 people, many of them relatives
of victims, honored the 241 American servicemen and 56 French
paratroopers killed in terrorist attacks five years ago in Beirut.
   In a brief wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery
where some of the American victims are buried, Marine Corps Maj.
Gen. Robert Winglass said they will be remembered as turning world
opinion against terrorists.
   ``That's the great lesson that's learned from the Beirut
experience,'' Winglass told the solemn gathering. ``That terrorism
is wrong; it is no longer recognized by any person of any stature
and dignity as having any foundation in principle.''
   The Oct. 23, 1983, attack on a Marine compound at the Beirut
airport by a truck laden with 12,000 pounds of explosives
eventually prompted the Reagan administration to withdraw 1,800
U.S. military troops in Lebanon as part of an international
peacekeeping force.
   ``It is difficult to recall the horror, the devastation and the
agonies that preceded this day five years ago,'' said John Knipple
of Alexandria, whose son, Lance Cpl. James Knipple, was killed in
the attack. ``They need to be honored, they need to be remembered.''
   Kevin Jiggets, then a lance corporal in Beirut and a survivor of
the explosion, said the ceremony also was to ``pay tribute to all
the victims of terrorist acts and their families.''
   The French paratroopers were killed the same day as the
Americans in a separate terrorist attack in another part of Beirut.
   The service was sponsored by No Greater Love, a 17-year-old
humanitarian organization devoted to helping families who have lost
loved ones in wars or by acts of terrorism.

   Rock musician Eddie Money said he's sold
5 million records and has little to show for it, but he hopes he's
winning his battles with drugs and alcohol.
   In an interview published Sunday in The Tribune of Oakland, the
39-year-old Money discussed his tumultuous life.
   ``Nobody's stealing from me. But I get tired of being the only
rock star shopping at Miller's Outpost,'' he said. ``I guess it's a
step up from K mart, where I used to get my clothes.''
   By his own count, he's been clean of drugs and booze since
shortly before his daughter Jessica's birth six months ago and
finds he sings better straight.
   ``Besides, I didn't want to be a stoned father raising a kid,
you know?'' he said.
   Money is known for such hits as ``Take Me Home Tonight,'' ``Baby
Hold On,'' and ``Walk on Water.'' But his struggles with drugs and
drink haven't been easy, and he says it's one reason he's living in
Los Angeles right now rather than the Bay area.
   ``I'm trying to stay away from my old crowd where it's easy to
get that stuff,'' he said. ``I'm just a guy with no control. I plan
to make it this time.''

   The Duke and Duchess of York played a
game of hide and seek with reporters Sunday, the last day of their
informal visit to this city.
   Australian Associated Press reported that Andrew and his wife,
the former Sarah Ferguson, spent the day at a private home in the
Adelaide Hills after an elaborate escape from the city to avoid the
media.
   Reporters admitted being fooled by decoys and a change of cars,
getting lost in a high-speed cat and mouse game along the freeway
into the hills. However, one TV station that had been tipped off
managed to find the couple at their secret location.
   Despite rumors that they were to make appearances at formal
functions, the two have kept a low profile in Adelaide.
   After their outing Sunday, the royal couple were to return to
the ship H.M.S. Edinburgh, which is scheduled to leave Monday
morning with the Duke, a crew member. The Duchess is expected to
meet up with him again in the West Australian capital of Perth on
Friday.

   Actress Marlo Thomas says she believes
giving birth should be a ``real family experience,'' and that's why
she was at a suburban hospital to help dedicate its new birthing
center.
   The West Suburban Hospital Medical Center tries to bring a
home-style atmosphere to the hospital _ if your home has designer
wallpaper, carpeting and retracting operating room lights.
   ``I'm glad to see maternity care catching up with the 21st
century and to make giving birth a real family experience,'' Ms.
Thomas said.
   Hospital spokeswoman Amy Lively said the center, similar to many
others at the country but billed as the first of its kind in the
Chicago area, marks an end to ``shuttle maternity'' in which the
woman checks into the labor room, then is taken to the delivery
room, and then on to the recovery room.
   At the center, all the stages of childbirth are accomplished in
a single-patient suite, with everything designed to make delivery
less stressful. Medical equipment is hidden away when not needed,
and family members can be on hand.

   It was a wedding of two second-generation
government officials as State Treasurer Mary Landrieu married Frank
Snellings, a fellow Democratic politician.
   Landrieu, daughter of former U.S. Housing and Urban Development
Secretary and New Orleans Mayor Moon Landrieu, was married Saturday
at the uptown Roman Catholic church that serves her parents'
neighborhood.
   Landrieu, one of nine children of the former mayor, was elected
state treasurer in 1987 after seven years in Louisiana's House of
Representatives, during which she took strong stands on issues
involving women and children. She also is a real estate developer.
   Snellings was elected in 1979 to the Ouachita Parish Police Jury
and is its past president. A police jury is the equivalent of a
county commission. His mother, Mary Louise Snellings, is a member
of the state's board of education.

   Iran's information minister said
political parties, sharply limited for years, will be allowed to
operate freely if they do not conspire against the Islamic
government.
   An opposition group called the announcement ``nothing new.''
   Minister Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri, in a statement broadcast
Sunday, said as long as the parties ``demonstrate their commitment
to the Islamic system and abide by their commitments in action,
they can operate freely.''
   The statement, made Saturday and carried by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency, said there would be limits on party
activities but did not spell them out. The IRNA report was
monitored in Nicosia.
   Rifts between different groups led to armed clashes between the
opposition groups and government forces in June 1981, two years
after the Islamic revolution that toppled the shah, Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi. Most parties were banned, including the Mujehedeen Khalq
Organization and the monarchists.
   The pro-Moscow Tudeh party was banned in early 1984. Several
groups went underground and worked clandestinely after the ban.
   The main government party, the Islamic Republic Party, and other
Islamic groups continued to operate legally. But Iran's
revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, abolished the
IRP in June 1987, after President Ali Khamenei and Parliament
Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said there was no need for it.
   A Parties Act passed by the Majlis, or Parliament, in August
1981, provided for political groups to operate legally as long as
they upheld the constitution. Groups were outlawed if they
undermined national unity, sowed discord, violated the principals
of Islam or the Islamic foundations of the country, or received
foreign aid.
   Parliament had not passed the act's enforcement procedures and
with the minister's statement, the government appeared to lay the
groundwork for that.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, a spokesman for the Mujahedeen Khalq scoffed
at the Iranian information minister's announcement.
   Spokesman Ali Reza Jaferzada said it was ``nothing new and was
made for external consumption.''
   ``The regime is besieged by international condemnation for its
massive executions and this is an attempt to beautify its ugly
image,'' the spokesman said.
   The opposition group charges that tens of thousands of political
opponents have been jailed and executed.
   The group had joined Iraq in fighting Iran during the 8-year
Iran-Iraq war. Iran and Iraq ceased fire Aug. 20 under a
U.N.-mediated peace agreement.

   Monday is homecoming day for the USS Vincennes,
the ship that mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner, and the
Navy is trying to remove any unease by bringing out a band and the
crew's wives and girlfriends.
   ``This is not one of those Vietnam things with the ship coming
in at midnight,'' Navy spokesman Cmdr. David Dillon said. ``We're
not going to sneak the ship in. We're inviting people to watch.
People understand this was an arduous deployment. The sailors have
a lot of public support.''
   The welcoming for the cruiser won't be any different than the
ones given to any other Navy ship returning from an extended
deployment, officials said.
   A Navy band will play the ``normal John Phillip Sousa-type
stuff,'' said Senior Chief Petty Officer Steve Hiney. ``It's going
to be a big story and we understand that (but) it's a regular, old
homecoming we're planning.
   ``Excited family members will be on the pier and excited sailors
on the ship. There's going to be punch and cookies. New fathers are
going to be seeing new kids for the first time. The wives and
girlfriends, mothers and fathers are going to be there.''
   Speakers at the welcoming include William Rose, mayor of
Vincennes, Ind., the city which like the ship was named for a
Revolutionary War battle, and Rep. Bill Lowery, R-Calif.
   Lowery organized a volunteer effort that gathered 10,000
signatures and sent the messages of support to the crew in the
Persian Gulf after the July 3 accidental downing of the Iranian
airliner. All 290 people aboard the civilian jet were killed.
   ``I empathized with how low the crew, the officers and the
skipper (Capt. Will Rogers III) were feeling,'' Lowery said.
``Their sense of isolation and anguish, because of the civilian
casualties on that airplane, they had to be feeling incredibly low.
   ``I just wanted to let them know that we understood. They were
defending their country to the best of their ability and that we
were not passing judgment ... They needed to know they were not
being abandoned.''
   The official Pentagon report concluded that the Vincennes
mistook the airliner for an Iranian F-14 fighter jet and blamed
misinterpreted readings of computer and radar data on crew stress
in a first-time combat situation. The Vincennes was engaged in a
firefight with several Iranian gunboats at the time.
   Dr. Thomas Rusk, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry,
said ending the Vincennes' tragedy-marred 180-day deployment with a
``normal'' greeting is the best way to smooth the sailors' reunion
with their families as well as society.
   ``I think that's absolutely indicated and I applaud the Navy for
doing that,'' said Rusk, who also works with police officers
involved in shootings in his private practice and formerly
counseled Air Force personnel while in the service.
   ``These people did the best they could. It's terrific that they
are being welcomed home just like anybody else,'' he said.
   But Rusk, a University of California, San Diego, clinical
faculty member, said it may be a difficult homecoming for those who
either were involved in the chain of command that led to the
decision to fire the missile or who are emotionally unable to open
up to others about their anguish.
   ``There's a grieving process here because you don't come back as
heroes,'' Rusk said. There may be the perception ``you come back as
inadvertent screw-ups. You grieve the sense of failure, the sense
of loss.''

   City efforts to keep Manhattan sidewalks clear
of debris are drawing complaints from street people who say
sanitation workers are carting off their belongings.
   The clean-up began months ago after residents on the Lower East
Side complained of mattresses, box springs and cardboard boxes
blocking sidewalks near a city-run men's shelter, the Sanitation
Department said.
   Two garbage trucks, four sanitation workers and several police
officers sweep the area once every week or two, said department
spokesman Vito Turso. ``Our job is to keep the streets clean,'' he
said. ``We do it under police supervision, because some of the
(homeless) people are pretty hostile.''
   But an advocate for the homeless saw it differently.
   ``We've had about a dozen complaints of homeless people getting
their belongings taken and thrown into garbage trucks,'' said
Robert Hayes, counsel for the Coalition for the Homeless.
   ``They took my ID, clothes, shorts, sleeping bag, everything I
had,'' said Robert Lee Marion, 47, who sleeps on a sidewalk. ``They
took my American flag, about 500 records, six to eight boxes of
books. It's terrorism.''
   Police said people who are blocking the sidewalk are asked to
move along with their belongings. If items are abandoned on the
street, they are considered garbage and thrown away.
   ``Everybody has a right to be on the street,'' said Sgt. John
Clifford, a spokesman for the Police Department. ``People do not
have the right to be on the street and litter.''

<HEAD>`Just Say No,' A Farce By Larry Kramer, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Larry Kramer's ``Just Say No'' is a sledgehammer
farce, battering everybody in sight, including the audience.
   It's nasty, savage, mean-spirited, unnerving, often in bad taste
and surprisingly, considering the possibilities, only sporadically
funny. That may be the fault of director David Esbjornson, who has
supervised the frantic door-slamming and bed-hopping with a heavy
hand and has neglected the comedy.
   The play, which arrived Thursday at off-Broadway's WPA Theater,
requires a not very great leap of imagination to identify its
supposedly fictional characters. The program proclaims ``any
resemblance to actual events, or to persons living or dead, is in
the eye of the beholder.'' Don't believe it.
   The chararcters include the closeted homosexual mayor of the
northeast's largest city; the termagant, clothes-horse wife of the
country's potentate who is called ``Daddy'' by just about everybody
in the play and the couple's ballet dancer son who lusts after his
Secret Service escorts.
   The play is set in the plush townhouse of Foppy Schwartz, the
gay confidant and lunch buddy to Mrs. Potentate. It's Foppy,
self-derided as ``the flower behind the drone,'' who sets the farce
spinning. He's galvanized into action as a crusader for gay rights
when he acquires a videotape of sexual hijinks by people in high
places.
   Blackmail is the order of the day as the tape is passed around
as frequently as the bodies. Of course, the bad guys win out in
this morality tale. And Kramer supplies a chilling finale that is
the best moment in the play. Until then, the playwright scatters
his potshots, shooting wildly at every alleged governmental
conspiracy of the last 25 years.
   But much of it is not very funny. Many of the jokes depend on
name recognition; those names that have not been changed to protect
the guilty.
   The acting doesn't help matters. Only David Margulies as the
epicene Foppy manages to be outrageous and affecting at the same
time. Kathleen Chalfant bears a striking resemblance to a certain
first lady. The others are given to hyperventilating, particularly
Joseph Ragno as the mayor and Keith Reddin as his boyfriend.
   In ``The Normal Heart,'' his best known play, Kramer was not
afraid to shout, telling the world about the inaction and
indifference in the government's fight againt AIDS.
   He shouts in ``Just Say No,'' but the sound is shriller, less
personal and more diffuse. This time, you can't hear the play for
all the yelling going on.

   Blacks hope to pick up at least one new House
member in the Nov. 8 elections but aren't optimistic that their
biggest political boost of the year _ Jesse Jackson's strong
showing in the Democratic primaries _ will result in major
congressional gains.
   If all 23 black House members win re-election and Donald Payne,
a Newark, N.J., councilman takes a vacant seat as expected, the
number of blacks in Congress will be at its highest level ever.
   All the House incumbents are Democrats and only one, Rep.
Cardiss Collins of Illinois, is a female.
   Payne, a Democrat running against black Republican Michael Webb,
is the front-runner in the race for the seat left open by the
retirement of Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee who has represented his predominantly black
district since 1948.
   The Congressional Black Caucus is cautiously optimistic about
picking up a seat in Louisiana's 8th district where attorney Faye
Williams is fighting a rematch against Rep. Clyde Holloway, the
one-term Republican.
   ``Faye is in a dead heat right now.'' said Rep. Mervyn M.
Dymally, D-Calif., caucus chairman. ``She does have a chance.''
   Another black challenger, Democrat Betty Wimbush, has virtually
no chance of upsetting Rep. Bill Young, a popular Republican who
has represented the St. Petersburg, Fla., area since 1970.
   Black Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., elected in 1986, must fend off an
enthusiastic challenge from Republican businessman Jack Coleman in
the 2nd district where blacks slightly outnumber whites.
   Ron Walters, a political science professor at Howard University,
said Espy ``might have a coattail problem'' if white voters turn
out heavily for GOP nominee George Bush and Rep. Trent Lott,
R-Miss., who is running for a vacant Senate seat.
   Blacks are keeping a close eye on Rep. Alan Wheat, D-Mo.
Although he was expected to win election to a fourth term, Wheat is
one of the few blacks elected to Congress from a majority white
district. His opponent in Kansas City is community activist Mary
Ellen Lobb.
   In an unusual development in the Senate, two black Republican
candidates _ Alan Keyes in Maryland and Maurice Dawkins of Virginia
_ are running against two popular Democrats. Neither Republican is
given any chance of winning.
   Keyes, a former State Department official, is challenging Sen.
Paul Sarbanes, while Dawkins, a one-time civil rights activist with
conservative views, is opposing former Gov. Charles Robb,
son-in-law of the late President Johnson.
   Linda Williams, an analyst at the Joint Center for Political
Studies, a research organization that focuses on black political
affairs, said Keyes and Dawkins were chosen to run in ``no-win
races.''
   Nevertheless, she said, the Republican Party will earn ``some
brownie points with black Americans'' by selecting two black
candidates for the Senate.
   The only black elected to the Senate since Reconstruction was
Edward Brooke, a Massachusetts Republican who was defeated in 1978.
   Despite Jackson's second-place finish in the Democratic
presidential primaries behind Michael Dukakis, some blacks hold
little hope of future gains in Congress unless more white Americans
can be persuaded to vote for black candidates.
   Walters doubts this will happen in the near future ``because of
race politics in America.''
   Some black politicians, such as Virginia Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder
manage to win white support by appealing to middle-income
Americans, Walters said. Wilder stressed his government experience
when he was elected in 1986.
   But Walters said the toughest races for black congressional
candidates are those in districts where a large segment of the
white population is at the lower end of the socio-economic scale.
   It is easier for blacks in the higher-income white districts,
which tend to be more liberal, Walters said. For instance,
Jackson's white support came primarily from ``the neo-liberal wing
of the yuppies,'' Williams said.
   Even so, she said, Jackson only received about 20 percent of the
white vote, about the same as successful black mayoral candidates.
   But Williams said the positive impact of the Jackson campaign is
that ``more blacks will run in places where they would not have run
before.'' She said there are about 7,000 local black officeholders.

<BYLINE>By TERRI COLBY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholics in central Illinois
offer prayers for farmers in trouble, but they're also sending a
little cash along with the good thoughts this year.
   The Diocese of Springfield, which covers 28 counties, is
offering interest-free loans of up to $2,000 to area farmers,
regardless of religious affiliation.
   ``We would like to (give) some generous help which comes from
the same heart that our prayers come from,'' says Bishop Daniel
Ryan, who heads the diocese.
   Applications will be accepted starting next month for the 1989
loan program, dubbed Project Isidore for the patron saint of
farmers. For the 1988 growing season, the program's first, about 40
loans averaging $1,000 were made. ``The purpose of the project is
to provide funds for farmers who are hurting, funds which would
help them not to turn away foreclosure on their properties, I'm
sorry to say, but which would give them some money for seed or
fertilizer or important things like that,'' Ryan said.
   Diocesan officials say the small loans won't save failing farms
but might make a difference for farmers who need help.
   ``We just don't have the availability of funds to stave off
these enormous problems which face our farmers,'' Ryan said, ``but
we wanted in a realistic way to help them with some items with
which we could be of help.''
   The loans are intended to help farmers with spring planting
needs for fuel, seed, feed, fertilizer and chemicals. Farmers can
apply between Nov. 7 and Feb. 1, and loan checks will be mailed by
the end of February.
   Ryan said the money for the program was not from the collection
plate but from donors who have chosen to remain anonymous.
   The size of this year's program will depend in part on future
donations as well as on the ability of the farmers helped so far to
repay their loans.
   ``We do not demand, but we certainly expect repayment, so that
we can help others who are in similar plights,'' Ryan said.
   The bishop said there could be an increase in the number of
applicants this year because of the drought, which hit Illinois
hard. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated earlier this
month that the state's farmers will have the worst corn yield in 28
years and the lowest soybean yield in 14 years.
   Diocese officials say the program, the only one of its kind in
Illinois, is patterned after a similar loan program offered in
Milwaukee.
   Harold Dodd, president of the Illinois Farmers Union, praised
the diocese for getting involved.
   ``I think it's a very commendable thing for the diocese to be
doing this,'' Dodd said. ``I would have to agree that that's not
going to cure people's problems, but every little bit helps.''

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops and allied militiamen of
the South Lebanon Army clashed Sunday with Palestinian guerrillas
in eastern Lebanon, killing four guerrillas, police said. Israel
radio said six guerrillas died.
   In south Beirut's slums, pro-Iranian Moslem zealots held rallies
to mark the suicide truck bombing of a U.S. Marine base at Beirut
Airport that killed 241 American servicemen Oct. 23, 1983.
   ``This morning, exactly five years ago, the Marines and the
French paratroopers were blown up,'' Hezbollah's spiritual guide,
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, told the crowd.
   ``Struggle to keep that panic alive. Struggle to keep this power
going everywhere,'' he said.
   A crowd of 3,000 at south Beirut's Bir el-Abed district also
erupted in anti-American and anti-Israeli chants when a Hezbollah
cleric identified the name of the suicide bomber who killed eight
Israeli soldiers in a south Lebanon attack Wednesday.
   In Jerusalem, Israel radio said an Israeli-backed militia may
execute Lebanese suspects by firing squad if a trial determines
they helped pro-Iranians extremists with Wednesday's car bomb. The
Israeli military would not comment on the report.
   About 80 people were detained in connection with the attack, the
Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot and Maariv newspapers reported.
   The sound of machine-gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades
reverberated across the slopes of Mount Hermon, on the northern
edge of Israel's self-designated security zone in south Lebanon.
   A police spokesman in Hasbaya, which overlooks six-by-10-mile
border enclave controlled by Israeli troops and the predominantly
Christian militiamen of the South Lebanon Army, said the battle
lasted five hours.
   Police said four guerrillas were injured.
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, led by
Marxist George Habash, later issued a statement in Hasbaya,
claiming its guerrillas attacked the Israeli-Lebanese militia
position and killed or wounded 10. Police said they could not
confirm any Israeli or Lebanese militia casualties.
   The Palestinian group, which has its headquarters in Damascus,
said four guerrillas were missing. The group maintains several
bases behind the Syrian army lines in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
   Hezbollah speakers identified Wednesday's suicide bomber as
Abdallah Atwah, 20, a Shiite whose family lives in Markabah in the
security zone.
   ``Our martyr chose to kill the Israelis with his purified
self,'' said Sheik Naim Kassem. The crowds raised clenched fists
and roared in unison ``War, war unto victory!'' and ``Death to
Israel!''
   The clerics told the Bir el-Abed rally that they delayed the
disclosure of Atwah's identity to coincide with the anniversary of
the Marine base truck bombing.
   The 1983 Beirut attack, the deadliest terrorist strike ever
against the United States, was accompanied by a simultaneous
suicide truck bombing of a French paratroop headquarters in Moslem
west Beirut, which killed 58 Frenchmen.
   The Marines and the French formed the bulk of a multinational
peacekeeping force that tried to end Lebanon's 13-year-old civil
war.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed responsibility for
Wednesday's attack. It said Atwah dedicated the bombing to the
10-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied
territories. More than 300 Palestinians and six Israelis have died
in the uprising.
   ``The language of stones with which you are facing Israel is
much stronger than all the weapons on earth,'' said a videotape
purportedly taken of Atwah just before the attack. Hezbollah
released the videotape Sunday.
   Israel avenged the car bombing with air strikes against
Palestinian and Shiite guerrilla bases in south Lebanon Friday,
killing 21 people and wounding 34.

<HEAD>New Cancer Treatment Tested On Two Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pittsburgh Cancer Institute has started
human testing of a treatment that doctors hope will enhance the
body's ability to fight cancer and maybe dissolve malignant tumors.
   Two patients at the center were the first people to receive the
treatment, in vitro sensitization or IVS, which previously had been
tested only on mice, The Pittsburgh Press reported Sunday.
   Studies have shown the process fights remaining tumor cells in
mice, the newspaper said. In some cases, the animals' cancer has
been eliminated entirely.
   Researchers say it is too soon to tell what effect the treatment
has had on the two patients. Their patients' identity and the type
of cancer they had were not disclosed. The tests began in June.
   ``I have no question but that at some point in the
intermediate-term future, this will be of therapeutic benefit,''
said Dr. John M. Kirkwood, one of two principal investigators in
the study.
   Dr. Norman Wolmark, the other lead investigator, said the
information gathered in the study should be useful in pointing the
way even if there is no immediate effect on the two patients'
tumors. ``I think the treatment can be modified in the hope that a
successful tumor response will result,'' he said.
   In vitro sensitization involves removing a tumor and irradiating
it to inactivate the tumor cells, researchers told The Press. The
cells are combined with a bacterium commonly used to vaccinate
against tuberculosis in order to stimulate the patient's immune
system.
   The patient then is injected with the irradiated cells to
produce sensitized lymphocytes, or cells critical to the body's
natural defense against disease and infection, researchers said.
Other steps in the complex treatment involve the use of the
tumor-fighting hormone interleukin-2.
   Researchers told the Press it may be two years or more before
enough patients are treated for a sufficient amount of time to know
the effectiveness of the treatment.
   The groundwork for the treatment was begun more than five years
ago at the National Cancer Institute in Washington by research
scientist Suyu Shu. In 1986, Shu moved to the Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute, which is affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh,
where he continued his laboratory work with mice. He recently left
for the University of Michigan.
   Shu's approach, called adoptive cellular immunotheraphy, is not
a widely used approach to cancer research. Most tumors are not
recognized or only weakly recognized by the body's immune system
and therefore continue growing because the immune system does
little to attack them, said Dr. Ronald Herberman, director of the
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.
   ``This is basically the main reason there has not been great
emphasis'' in research to enhance the immune system, he told the
newspaper.
   Herberman said researchers, ideally, would ``like to see some
almost immediate shrinkage of the tumor. But it may not happen that
way.''
   ``It's a tall order to expect this kind of treatment would
actually make a large tumor melt away,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Attorneys Hoping To Form Own ABA-Style Organization: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet attorneys hope reforms in their
country will give them more independence, and are looking to the
American Bar Association as a possible model for a Soviet lawyers
organization, a law journal reports.
   A delegation of lawyers and judges from the Soviet Union met
with their counterparts at ABA offices in Washington and Chicago in
the past two weeks, the legal newspaper, The Daily Journal,
reported in Monday's editions.
   Delegates candidly discussed problems concerning the Soviet
legal system and the effects of Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
policy of perestroika, or restructuring, on the legal profession.
   ``We have to have perestroika in the essence of our law,'' said
group leader Venyamin Yakovlev. ``And because advokati (lawyers)
know the practical realities that perestroika can have on the
practice of law, it is important to have an independent union of
lawyers that can push for change.''
   The delegation included a justice of the Latvian Supreme Court,
district judges from Moscow and Leningrad, law professors, several
private attorneys, procurators _ similar to American prosecutors _
and police investigators.
   ``They're interested in our structure as they restructure,''
said ABA president-elect Stanley Chavin. ``They're beginning to
envision the practice of law as a free-standing institution of its
own.''
   Members of the delegation expressed hope that Soviet attorneys
will have a bigger role in shaping their country's laws.
   But Yakovlev said reform may be slow in coming and blamed that
on the bureaucracy at the Ministry of Justice, which he called
``too big, too slow and too slow-thinking.''
   The ministry puts ministry officials on public bodies, evaluates
lawyers' work and regulate the number of lawyers. Some critics say
that people's rights are eroded under the present system, because
for example the state could give a lawyer a poor evaluation for
helping a defendant too strongly.
   ``Psychological preconceptions against change are the main
roadblock we have to remove. The (legal) apparatus still operates
along familiar lines; it's very difficult to cope with new ideas,''
Yakovlev said.
   Some Soviet lawyers envision an attorneys' organization that
would work for an independent judiciary, lobby the Supreme Soviet
on legislation and file ``friend of the court'' briefs before the
Supreme Court in Moscow.
   ``Traditionally, the Soviets never had lobbyists or special
interest groups since they could not acknowledge that people had
interests different than the state,'' said Randy Bregman, program
director at the Institute of International Law.

<HEAD>Shamir, Peres Face Off In Televised Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, in a
debate Sunday with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, accused his rival
of election interference by seeking the support of Jordan's King
Hussein for Peres' peace plan.
   Peres countered that Shamir misquoted him during the televised
debate and claimed Shamir staffers have lied to the voters.
   ``I propose to Mr. Shamir to urge his people to speak the
truth,'' Peres said.
   The half-hour debate is the only one scheduled before the Nov. 1
parliamentary election. Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc,
and Labor Party leader Peres reiterated their positions on Middle
East peace initiatives.
   Shamir called for direct talks with Arab leaders on Palestinian
autonomy and Peres said only an international peace conference
would bring Hussein and the Palestinians to the negotiating table.
   About 200 reporters and party activists watched the debate over
closed-circuit television in Likud's television studio in the Kfar
Maccabia sports village.
   Aides for both sides claimed victory but suggested the debate
would have little influence on Israel's undecided voters, estimated
at 8 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters.
   Shamir and Peres have ruled in a coalition government since the
1984 elections ended in stalemate.
   Shamir's most heated remarks came when asked to comment on a
U.S. television program last week in which Peres and Hussein
appeared separately for interviews. Hussein said a Shamir victory
would be an ``absolute disaster.''
   ``I must say that to involve an Arab ruler in Israel's election
campaign is crass interference. It is unprecedented,'' said Shamir.
   Shamir, who opposes an international conference, claimed Peres
rejected the idea three years ago. He quoted Peres as saying such a
forum would lead to an Israeli defeat.
   Peres accused Shamir of misquoting him deliberately. ``These are
very terrible and serious allegations,'' Peres said.
   He also said Shamir was playing a ``verbal game'' in talking
about Palestinian autonomy.
   ``I'd advise Mr. Shamir to read the Likud platform,'' Peres
said, pulling out the document. ``It is written there: `Implement
the right to exert sovereignty over Judea, Samaria (the West Bank)
and Gaza.'''
   Peres has said he is willing to give up some of the
Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River and Gaza Strip to
the Palestinians for peace. He maintains this is better than trying
to govern the occupied lands' 1.5 million Arabs against their will.
   Shamir refuses to give up any of the land seized from Egypt and
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War. He favors negotiating limited
autonomy for the Palestinians.
   Shamir insisted that only direct negotiations could bring a
settlement with Arab nations and the Palestinians.
   During a 10-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands,
more than 300 Palestinians and six Israelis have been killed.
   In a related development, the Israeli newspaper Hadashot said in
an unattributed report Sunday that Peres tried to get Hussein to
visit Jerusalem before the elections as part of a peace initiative
but the monarch refused.
   The Foreign Ministry declined comment.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, Palestine Liberation Organization leader
Yasser Arafat was quoted Sunday as urging Arab-Israelis to
participate in Israeli elections ``because they can push forward
the peace process.''
   By participating in the elections, Arabs can assure themselves
of 14-15 seats in Israel's 120-member parliament and influence the
government, Arafat was quoted as telling Egypt's Middle East News
Agency. The report was monitored in Cairo.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak said Sunday that
Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization have agreed on a
form of a confederation but offered few details on the proposed
union.
   Mubarak made the statement to the state-run Middle East News
Agency upon returning home from meetings with King Hussein of
Jordan, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq.
   ``They (Jordan and the PLO) are in agreement on this and
(Arafat) has announced that he is for the confederation with
Jordan,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying.
   He did not elaborate but said King Hussein and Arafat met in an
``extremely cordial atmosphere'' Saturday in Aqaba, Jordan. After
that meeting Mubarak and Arafat flew to Baghdad for the talks with
President Hussein.
   In Aqaba, the Jordanian monarch said Sunday he had agreed with
Arafat ``to continue contacts to coordinate positions in the
service of the Palestinian cause,'' according to Petra, Jordan's
official news agency.
   The agency also said the king ``affirmed the centrality'' of the
PLO's role in the peace process, especially following Jordan's July
31 decision to cut legal links with the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   The king's remarks were some of the warmest he has made about
the PLO since breaking with the organization in 1986. At that time
he accused the PLO of reneging on agreements dealing with Middle
East peace proposals.
   But on Sunday, Petra said the king ``expressed satisfaction with
the determination of the PLO to shoulder direct responsibility to
attain the aspirations of the Palestinian people and obtain their
legitimate national rights on their own soil.''
   In Baghdad the Egyptian agency quoted Arafat as saying the
weekend talks were ``positive and cordial. We have placed a basis
for a new relation between the PLO and the Jordanian kingdom.''
   Palestinian sources in Baghdad said the weekend negotiations
were aimed at consolidating an Arab position before Israel's Nov. 1
parliamentary election and U.S. presidential balloting Nov. 8.
   The PLO's palriament, the Palestine National Council, is
scheduled to meet next month in Algiers, Algeria. It is expected to
discuss declaring an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, seized from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle
East War.
   More than 300 Palestinians and six Israelis have been slain in a
10-month Palestinian uprising over Israeli rule in the occupied
lands.
   Arab diplomatic sources in Baghdad said Arafat, President
Hussein and Mubarak also agreed on an Arab summit meeting, proposed
by King Hussein, on the Iran-Iraq peace talks and the governmental
crisis in Lebanon.
   Egypt and Jordan supported Iraq in the 8-year-old war with
Irran. Iran and Iraq have maintained a U.N.-mediated Aug. 20
cease-fire.
   Lebanon's Parliament failed to pick a new president last month,
and Christians and Moslems established rival leaderships.

<HEAD>FBI Considers Whether To Pursue Inquiry Into Pakistan Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI is examining a report by Pakistan on
the plane crash two months ago that killed Pakistani President
Mohammad Zia ul-Haq to determine whether to pursue an independent
investigation of its own, officials said Sunday.
   ``We've been forwarded the report by the Justice and State
departments and we're analyzing it now,'' FBI spokesman Demery
Bishop said of the Pakistani investigation into the Aug. 17 crash
that also killed the U.S. ambassador to the country and 28 others
aboard.
   ``It's more of an inquiry now,'' Bishop said. ``Whether we will
go forward with it or the next step is uncertain at this point.''
   The Pakistani investigation, which was assisted by a team of
U.S. technical experts, concluded that sabotage was the most likely
cause of the crash, according to parts of the report made public
last week.
   Members of Congress were briefed on the report by Pentagon and
State Department officials in closed-door meetings last week.
Reportedly, they were told the Pakistani investigation was unable
to pin down the exact cause of the crash.
   Among those killed were U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and Brig.
Gen. Herbert M. Wassom, the senior American defense official
stationed in Pakistan.
   The crash and the investigation into it has been a sensitive
issue for U.S. officials because of Zia's role, with encouragement
from the United States, in helping supply rebel guerrillas in their
fight against Soviet troops in neighboring Afghanistan.

   Snow fell Sunday over the upper Mississippi Valley and in the
western Great Lakes region, and heavy rain fell in parts of the
south-central states.
   While some areas had winter-like weather, Austin, Texas, posted
a record high of 91 and Miami tied its record of 85 degrees.
   A cold front that extended over the upper Great Lakes and middle
Mississippi Valley pushed eastward into the Ohio Valley and sagged
south across the lower Mississippi Valley. Showers and
thunderstorms lined up just ahead of the cold front from
Mississippi into southeastern Texas.
   Thunderstorms produced generous rainfall in parts of Arkansas,
especially in the northwestern corner, where Berryville got 1.34
inches and 1.02 inches fell at Dardendale.
   The cold front extended from a low pressure system over Lake
Michigan, and colder air pulling around the western side of the low
produced light snow during the morning over central and eastern
Minnesota.
   The snow moved into northern Wisconsin and western Upper
Michigan. Iron River, Mich., reported 3 inches of snow with an inch
reported at Calumet. In Wisconsin, up to 2 inches of snow fell
across Oneida County, including Rhinelander, and in parts of Vilas
and Lincoln counties.
   Strong, gusty wind whistled across the middle Mississippi and
lower Missouri valleys during the afternoon, with gusts peaking
between 35 and 50 mph across the eastern sections of South Dakota
and eastern Nebraska into much of Iowa.
   Elsewhere, low pressure drifting northward out of Maine produced
light rain over northern New England.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 30
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 91 at McAllen and Harlingen, Texas.
Sunday morning's low was 12 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Monday, widespread showers were forecast throughout the
central and eastern Great Lakes, the upper Ohio Valley and mid
Atlantic region into southern and central New England. Scattered
snow showers were forecast in colder air across the western parts
of the Great Lakes. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were
forecast across northern and central Florida.
   Highs in the 30s were predicted from northern Minnesota into
northern Wisconsin; in the 40s or 50s across much of the nation
east of the Mississippi River; in the 50s over the Northwest, near
the Canadian border, and into the northern Plains; in the 60s or
70s across much of the nation west of the Mississippi, and from the
lower Mississippi Valley into the southern Atlantic region; in the
80s across southern Florida, and from the Rio Grande Valley of
Texas into the valleys of California; and in the 90s across the
desert Southwest.

Belgian tour reported Sunday.
   They said he was taken to a hospital in Antwerp after he was
stricken Saturday in the port city of Ostend and his condition was
not life threatening.
   The 63-year-old musician is one of Greece's most popular
composers and singers. He also is known for his political career
and opposition to the military dictatorship that ruled from 1967-74.
   Elected as a communist member of Parliament, he was jailed for
three years but freed in 1970 under international pressure. After
exile in France he returned to Greece in 1974. He was re-elected to
Parliament in 1981.
   Theodorakis was on a nine-day tour of Belgium and his last
concert, which was canceled, had been been scheduled for Saturday
in Ostend.

   Nine Palestinians were wounded in battles with
Israeli troops Sunday in the occupied territories, Arab sources
reported.
   Two 18-year-olds were shot in a clash in the central market area
of Nablus on the West Bank, said hospital officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. Nablus, the West Bank's largest city with a
population of 120,000, has been the site of repeated battles in
recent days.
   In the Gaza Strip, five teen-agers were wounded and a
12-year-old boy was shot in the hand during a clash at the Shati
refugee camp in Gaza City, hospital officials said.
   An Arab reporter said a youth, 20, was shot and wounded in the
leg at the Gaza Strip's Khan Younis refugee camp.
   An army spokesman said the reports were being checked.
   More than 7,000 people have been wounded since the Palestinians
launched their uprising against Israeli rule Dec. 8 in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. More than 300 Palestinians have been killed,
and six Israelis have died.
   The army announced that 54 Arab prisoners were released from the
Ketziot prison camp in the Negev Desert on Israeli territory to
mark the Moslem holy day commemorating Prophet Mohammed's birthdate.
   Earlier this month, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said that
18,000 Palestinians have been detained during the 10-month
uprising. He said about 5,600 were still in jails.
   The Ketziot prison, which has drawn international criticism for
its harsh desert conditions, is believed to hold about 2,200
detainees.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 450 years after Copernicus proved the
Earth revolves around the sun, millions of adult Americans seem to
think it's the other way around, a researcher said Sunday.
   ``It's a fairly dire situation,'' said Jon Miller, director of
the Public Opinion Laboratory at Northern Illinois University, who
conducted a nationwide survey for the National Science Foundation.
   ``The results show that on very basic ideas, vast numbers of
Americans are scientifically illiterate,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   In the telephone survey of 2,041 adults 18 or older, conducted
in July, people were asked about 75 questions testing their
knowledge of basic science, Miller said. The survey had a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percent.
   Asked whether the Earth goes around the sun or the sun around
the Earth, 21 percent replied incorrectly. Seven percent said they
didn't know.
   Of the 72 percent who answered correctly, 45 percent said it
takes one year for the Earth to orbit the sun, 17 percent said one
day, 2 percent said one month and 9 percent didn't know.
   The responses indicate that about 55 percent of adult Americans,
or some 94 million people, don't know that the Earth revolves
around the sun once a year, Miller said.
   ``It shows that there are basic misunderstandings about some of
the things we would have presumed virtually everyone would have
known,'' said Miller, a political science professor at Northern
Illinois University in DeKalb, about 60 miles west of Chicago.
   A similar survey conducted by the polling group in 1985
indicated that only about 5 percent of adult Americans could be
considered ``scientifically literate,'' with basic knowledge of
scientific vocabulary, methodology and an understanding of the
impact of science on the world, Miller said.
   Miller said the latest results, which haven't been fully
tabulated yet, should put the literacy rate in the 5 to 7 percent
range. The survey results will be incorporated into an National
Science Foundation report to be issued next year on the state of
American science and technology.
   Leon Lederman, who was named co-winner of the 1988 Nobel Prize
for physics, called the latest findings ``pretty devastating.''
   ``I'm not surprised ... but it's much worse than anyone had
expected,'' he said Sunday in a telephone interview. ``How you can
preserve democracy when the world is increasingly more complex
scientifically and technologically, and people are increasingly
more ignorant of the issues.''
   Lederman said he plans to retire next year as director of the
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., to teach
physics to freshmen at the University of Chicago.
   ``Get them while they're young ... if you get them as a senior
it's too late,'' he said. ``We have to roll up our sleeves and get
to work ... to improve and solve the scientific literacy question.''
   In an election year, in which candidates are talking about
issues like the Strategic Defense Initiative, acid rain, the
greenhouse effect and the space race, the survey results indicate
many Americans have little idea of what the candidates are talking
about, Miller said.
   Asked a true-false question on whether lasers _ an essential
component of the Star Wars defense system _ work by focusing sound
waves, only 36 percent of the respondents correctly answered the
statement was false. Twenty-nine percent thought it was true and 35
percent said they didn't know.
   Lasers work by focusing light waves.
   ``I think the next president and Congress have to face this
issue (of scientific illiteracy) in some fashion or the other,'' he
said.
   Miller says schools deserve a lot of blame for doing a poor job
in teaching math and science.

<TEXT>
   Hot colors burst onto the scene in Enrico Coveri's
Sunday ready-to-wear show for next summer _ an alternative to the
more subdued spice tones and summer darks shown nearly everywhere
else this week.
   Coveri has always been known for his bright colors, but this
time he outdid himself in easy clothes that didn't pretend to be
high fashion.
   One entire sports line _ shorts, knotted blouses, short skirts _
was made up in the stars and stripes of Old Glory. Coveri also
showed long jackets with narrow or wide pants and the Paris
favorite of little boleros and pantskirts, best in solid black or
white linen.
   But it was the maypole ribbons that really stood out.
Multicolored maypole streamers covered sleeves and belts, laced
bare midriffs and fluttered from picture hats.
   Coveri offered a grand finale of strapless evening chiffons with
the multicolored maypole effect in draped chiffon. The prettiest
were in shades of raspberry and pink or chartreuse and moss greens.
   Christian Lacroix also offered a hot-and-dark color palette in
his ``Luxe'' show, a collection between couture and ready-to-wear
with clothes selling at around $5,000 or more per item.
   There was nearly enough neon pink and green in the luxury
cottons and chiffons to evoke Miami Beach, and some spectators
preferred Lacroix's less expensive, more versatile ready-to-wear
clothes shown last week.
   But Sunday's well-cut clothes had their own charm, and the
antidote to electric colors was plenty of black and white.
   Besides some short and fitted ottoman cotton suits, Lacroix
mixed themes of flower and polka dot prints in crepe de chine
dresses or pareo-draped strapless dresses with mid-calf skirts.
Tiny boleros heightened the long effect.
   His favorite remained high-waisted flared linen pants suits and
jumpsuits. And he brought out some of his trademark full trapeze
coats.
   But the prettiest and most practical chiffons in bright green,
pink or black featured a removable long, full skirt with a big
satin bow over the sheath underneath, giving two kinds of dress in
one.
   Japanese designer Issey Miyake is considered as much artist as a
maker of clothes, and following his show fans went to the opening
of his retrospective at the Fashion Museum in the Decorative Arts
wing of the Louvre.
   In his show for next summer, Miyake wowed the audience with his
use of a new type of cotton that had built-in tiny pleats to look
like delicate ribbing. In pearly grey, the dresses had a geometric
or folded paper look _ like dozens of versions of a walking Chinese
lantern.
   He also threw in cotton tunics and dresses in red-white-blue
French flag colors, along with high-topped suspender jumpsuits in
saffron, royal blue or chartreuse.
   Martine Sitbon, who sometimes dips into the costume bag for
ideas, was inspired this time by l8th-century dandies. With pointed
tails or swallowtails, the jackets over knickers or fuller pants
came out in hot-pepper red, aubergine orange or okra green, with
big ruffled jabots for the aristocratic touch.

   Gang members crashed a teen birthday party,
leaving one man stabbed to death and two others wounded, as weekend
gang violence in Southern California claimed a total of four lives
and wounded five.
   Several local gang members crashed a 16th-birthday party for two
girls in West Valinda late Saturday, said Los Angeles County
sheriff's Deputy Dan Cox.
   A fight broke out in the street and Migel Cruz, 21, was fatally
stabbed in the chest, Cox said. Two brothers who were friends of
the hosts were treated for wounds and released from a hospital.
   Elsewhere, gang members in a car mistook six youths in another
car for rivals early Saturday in Lennox and chased them through
several neighborhoods, firing several shots along the way,
sheriff's Lt. Ron Herbst said.
   Two parting shots were fired even when the fleeing youths
reached the door of the sheriff's station in the area 10 miles
south of downtown.
   ``They were scared but not hurt,'' Herbst said.
   A description of the attackers' car was broadcast and a few
minutes later Inglewood police stopped the car and arrested a
14-year-old boy. Other occupants of the stolen car got away.
   Elsewhere, a reputed gang member was wounded in a drive-by
shooting at Lincoln Park early Sunday after an argument between two
groups, police Detective Robert Suter said. Two young men were
being sought.
   The young man was in extremely critical condition at County-USC
Medical Center, Suter said.
   In an attack in Lincoln Heights, another alleged gang member was
shot several times and died at County-USC Medical Center, Suter
said.
   One man was killed and another wounded in a gang-related
shooting late Saturday in Koreatown, police said. Several men were
drinking beer on a porch when the occupants of two cars driving by
shouted gang slogans, then opened fire, Sgt. Alan Bollinger said.
   Late Friday, a 21-year-old man was killed while driving in the
south-central area of the city when three or four young men in a
sedan pulled alongside and yelled a gang slogan, said Deputy Roger
Hom.
   After a brief exchange, someone in the sedan fired several
shots. The man was hit in the chest and died at Martin Luther King
Jr.-Drew Medical Center.
   Three men in a vehicle matching the description of the gunman's
car were stopped and taken in for questioning. There were no
immediate arrests.
   Earlier Friday night, a fight between rival gangs at a Fairfax
High School football game escalated into a street shooting in which
a passenger on a passing motorcycle was wounded. She was in stable
condition at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with a gunshot wound to
the neck, police said.
   The gang members later shot at a pedestrian on a nearby street,
but missed, said Sgt. Robert Warden. There were no arrests.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Herbert Blaize told
his countrymen Sunday never to repeat the ``bitter fratricidal
upheaval'' that brought a U.S.-led invasion of this tiny Caribbean
island five years ago.
   ``Eagles do not pay attention to flies,'' Blaize said in a
message marking the invasion. ``Like the eagles, Grenadians should
soar above petty squabbles and individual differences, should try
to understand and help each other, and together concentrate on the
solution of their problems.''
   The prime minister's message recalled the events of Oct. 19,
1983, at army headquarters at Fort George, then known as Fort
Rupert.
   Then Prime Minister Maurice Bishop had been put under house
arrest on Oct. 13 during a power struggle within his leftist
government, but six days later a crowd of thousands marched to his
house and freed him.
   Bishop and some followers went to Fort Rupert, where army troops
in three armored vehicles attacked them with mortars and automatic
weapons.
   Bishop, some members of his Cabinet and others were lined up
against a wall and shot. About 50 people were killed.
   ``We were the targets of the guns in a war among brothers,''
Blaize said in a message read at all of the churches of this
133-square-mile island about 100 miles north of Venezuela. ``We
shot and killed our own parents and brothers, devastated our land
and wasted our property. We pray God that never again should we be
subjected to such cruel experience and wasteful carnage.''
   On Oct. 25, the United States invaded Grenada along with
military units from from seven Caribbean nations. Eighteen
Americans, 45 Grenadans and 29 Cubans were killed during the
fighting.
   In 1984 Blaize helped form the New National Party, which won
parliamentary elections later that year. It was the first elected
government in Grenada since 1979.
   In his message Sunday, Blaize said confrontation is the route
most likely to lead to national catastrophe.
   ``We should always keep in mind that the path of confrontation
will sooner or later bring about self-annihilation for the whole
nation, as was so poignantly demonstrated five years ago,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A state agency and private groups
collected everything from toys to money over the weekend for the 53
children removed from the care of an organization which ran a rural
house where one child died.
   Officials said the children's plight had prompted an outpouring
of clothes, toys, money and volunteers.
   ``We've never seen anything this large,'' said Lynne Landon, a
volunteer supervisor for the state Children's Services Division.
   The state filed charges that children were abused while in the
care of the Watts Christian Center of Los Angeles after the death
of 8-year-old Dayna Lorea Broussard, daughter of Watts Christian
Center leader Eldridge Broussard Jr.
   The 53 children were found by Clackamas County sheriff's
deputies on Oct. 14 at a rural house used by the group east of
Sandy, about 30 miles southeast of Portland.
   The Children's Services Division was particularly in need of gym
bags, baby clothes, money and volunteers willing to commit time
beyond the current crisis.
   ``The most valuable donation is people who are willing to work
with children for long hours,'' Landon said. ``There are many
children who need help for the long haul.''
   About a dozen people have offered such help, she said.
   Donations for the children also poured in Saturday to the Muslim
Community Center in northeast Portland. Even children have come
forward, giving up their own toys for other children, said Imam
Mikal Shabazz of the center.
   ``We're not making a judgment of what happened,'' Shabazz said.
``We want to extend our love and charitable assistance, and due
process will take care of the rest.''

<HEAD>Police Academy Director Defends His Actions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of training at a police academy where
16 cadets were hospitalized for dehydration and exhaustion says he
wouldn't do anything differently, given what he knew at the time.
   State Trooper Charles B. Gilmore, 31, defended the academy's
training regimen and his own conduct two months ago, saying he
urged the cadets to drink plenty of water and that he reduced their
exercise schedules.
   Gilmore said he thinks daily of Timothy Shepard, 25, the police
recruit who collapsed while running around a track, went into a
coma and required a liver transplant.
   ``I feel bad for Tim Shepard, and I feel for his family,''
Gilmore said. ``There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think
about him. But I look back, and with what I knew, I wouldn't have
done anything differently. There was no detection of anything going
wrong until he went down on the track.''
   Gilmore said he was not responsible for screening candidates for
the Criminal Justice Training Center in Agawam, which trains police
officers for cities and towns in western Massachusetts.
   He had assumed that the entrance requirements were the same as
for the state Police Academy in Framingham, he said. It was not
until three days into the training course that another officer,
Cpl. William Coulter, reviewed the pre-screening material and found
that only 20 of the 50 cadets in the class were in good enough
shape to cope, Gilmore said.
   Gilmore also said he never received a 1985 memo from the
Criminal Justice Training Council urging moderate exercise and
banning some aspects of so-called stress training.
   Many states have abandoned stress training, which is intended to
produce anxiety and confusion through unclear orders, verbal abuse,
sudden actions, humiliating discipline and other pressures.
   ``There has been a civilization of police training, but
(Massachusetts) is a real dinosaur situation. It is really a
shocking perversion,'' said George Kirkham, a criminologist at
Florida State University.
   ``Massachusetts is an anachronism when it comes to law
enforcement. It's 40 years behind the times,'' added Los Angeles
Deputy Police Chief Louis Reiter. ``You could never show that this
kind of training makes a better police officer.''
   But Gilmore defended stress training, saying it prepares
officers for the high-stress situations they face on the job.
   After the controversy erupted over the illnesses of the cadets,
Gilmore voluntarily requested reassignment from the training center
to the state police academy. The center is under investigation by
Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon.

   The crew of a freight train say they feel
they've been abandoned by the government since their train ran over
the legs of a protester who sat on railroad tracks outside the
Concord Naval Weapons Station.
   ``Even though we do work for the Navy and I should not say this,
we have not received any public support from the Navy, and that is
something I am very bitter about,'' brakeman Bob Mayfield said
Saturday at a rally near the base about 35 miles east of San
Francisco.
   About 40 people turned out at the event, set up to raise money
and public support for the crew's defense against a lawsuit filed
by maimed protester S. Brian Willson, who lost both lower legs.
   Crew attorney Bill Kolin said the government originally offered
to pay defense attorneys, but at lower than average rates. Now the
government refuses to pay anything, he said.
   A three-man, civilian crew was operating the train Sept. 1,
1987, when Willson and others sat on the tracks to protest arms
shipments to Central America. Willson was the only demonstrator
seriously hurt.
   Since the incident, Mayfield, engineer David A. Humiston and
conductor Ralph Dawson have not returned to work and meet weekly
with a psychologist.
   They say they were not warned that protesters planned to block
the train, although base officials knew about it in advance.
   ``It was a terrible accident and I hate that he had to suffer
like he did, but the fact remains that he is not the only one
suffering,'' said Dawson.
   During the Saturday rally, the arms shipment protest continued
nearby.
   Demonstrator Diane Poole said the crew's superiors knew the
protesters were on the tracks and the crew was ``guilty of
following orders.''
   ``I was deeply moved from what the train crew said, and I feel a
lot of personal empathy for them,'' Poole said. ``I've seen a lot
of lies, but not from the train crew.''
   Willson has spent the last year speaking out against U.S.
intervention in Central America.

   Former world heavyweight boxing champion Leon
Spinks is attending bartending school, learning to mix drinks and
punches instead of throwing them.
   ``Serving drinks can be the hardest thing; they've got a lot of

   DeLoach and Spinks both declined to elaborate on the
circumstances that led the former champ to tend bar in Detroit.
   ``Some things you can ask a person about that shouldn't be
asked,'' DeLoach said.
   Spinks said he wants to do well in his new career.
   ``Maybe, someday, down the road, I may open my own place,''

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Sunday that a Lebanese woman
arrested in Milan planned to deliver photographs of American
hostages to an Italian man who has been linked to arms scandals and
the Italian secret service.
   The man, Aldo Anghessa, was questioned by police after they
found the photos and a letter from a hostage hidden in a false
bottom of the woman's suitcase Thursday, authorities said. She said
Anghessa was to receive them, they reported.
   Fortunato Finoli, deputy director of Milan's police
anti-terrorist unit, refused to say what Anghessa told police or
who he might be representing. The Italian was released after
questioning.
   The Lebanese woman, identified as Aline Ibrahim Rizkallah, 36,
was charged with carrying $1,000 in counterfeit U.S. bills and 50
grams of heroin, police said. She was in jail in Milan.
   The Rome daily La Repubblica said Anghessa had ties to the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration. The U.S. Embassy refused comment
on the report.
   Police were still checking Sunday to see if the photographs of
Terry Anderson, Alann Steen and another man were originals, said
Finoli.
   Police also asked U.S. authorities for samples of Steen's
handwriting to authenticate the letter bearing his name, Finoli
said by telephone.
   The third photograph originally was believed to be of hostage
Thomas Sutherland, but authorities later decided they were unsure
and were still examining the picture, Finoli said.
   The identification of Anghessa added a new twist to the case,
which police first described Saturday.
   Italian media speculated that Anghessa may have been acting as a
go-between in efforts to free hostages held in Lebanon. Police
refused to comment on his role.
   Anghessa, 44, who has dual Swiss-Italian nationality, was
arrested a year ago following the seizure of a Lebanese cargo ship
off Bari in southern Italy. Police said the ship was carrying drugs
and weapons for use by the Mafia and Middle East terrorists linked
to Palestinian extremist Abu Nidal.
   The case was dubbed ``Italy's Irangate scandal'' by Italian
media after investigating magistrates said the cargo was part of a
ring that also delivered Italian mines to Iran via Syria.
   Anghessa was charged with organizing groups for illegal export
of weapons, international drug trafficking and organizing an armed
band for terrorist ends. However, the charges were later dropped.
   He has also worked as an informer for Swiss and Italian secret
services, according to reports by officials in both countries last
year. Italian authorities have not given details of his role in the
secret services, but the Italian news media said he worked in
several countries, including Lebanon.
   The Lebanese woman said she was a courier and denied knowing
anything about the photos, the letter or other documents written in
Italian that were hidden in her suitcase, police said.
   Authorities were still trying to decipher the documents, which
appeared to be in code, Finoli said. The letter bearing Steen's
name was written in English and ``expressed thanks to everyone who
was working for his liberation,'' Finoli said.
   The Lebanese woman arrived at Milan's Linate Airport on Thursday
on a Middle East Airlines flight from Beirut.
   She told police an Italian man was to receive the photographs
and documents. Police traced Anghessa through a telephone number in
the woman's purse, newspapers said.
   Newspapers said the woman told police the heroin was to be
delivered to a different man.
   Finoli said the woman told them she was a Maronite Christian
guerrilla until last year. She has a Lebanese passport but was born
in Jordan, police said.
   Maronites are a Western-oriented group that oppose pro-Iranian
fundamentalist factions like those holding the U.S. hostages.
   Anderson and Sutherland are held by Islamic Jihad, while Steen's
kidnapping has been claimed by the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation
of Palestine.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon. He was
kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, was abducted three months later. He is of
Fort Collins, Colo.
   Steen, of Boston, was kidnapped on Jan. 24, 1987 at Beirut
University College, where he taught.
   There are nine Americans held by pro-Iranian extremist factions
linked to Hezbollah, or Party of God. Other foreigners believed
held are three Britons, an Irishman and an Italian.

<HEAD>Leader Says Force Could be Used to Maintain Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
said in a speech made public Sunday that authorities will not
hesitate to use force if needed to protect the nation's communist
system.
   He also called on the opposition to avoid ``extreme'' elements.
   Jaruzelski said union pluralism can be allowed in Poland only
when the economy is improved and alternative political forms are
created so that unions do not serve as vehicles for political
demands.
   ``I am aware that no Polish problem can be solved in the long
run by force. Reaching for it is an extreme measure _ although the
hand will not shake if there are attempts at destabilization and an
overthrow of the socialist state,'' he said.
   ``But our force should be first of all in facts and arguments,''
he added, and the success of economic policies will determine the
extent of public support for the authorities.
   Jaruzelski spoke Friday in Warsaw to a meeting of 500
pro-government workers from around the country. Excerpts of the
speech were not made public until Sunday.
   There was a wave of strikes in August with workers demanding
that the outlawed Solidarity union be legalized. Solidarity,
chartered by the government during strikes in 1980, was suspended
in December 1981 and subsequently declared illegal.
   The strikes last August ended when the government promised to
hold round-table talks with the opposition that could include the
topic of Solidarity's future.
   Both sides have said they want the talks to start as soon as
possible and have blamed the other for delays.
   Jaruzelski, head of the Polish United Workers (Communist) Party,
said both political and economic conditions must be right for union
pluralism.
   His party has said a strong economy is needed if Solidarity is
to be legalized, because legalization would set off a ``bidding
war'' of economic demands between Solidarity and the existing
official unions.
   Jaruzelski said other conditions for union pluralism are that
all partners to discussions in Poland recognize the country will
remain part of the Soviet bloc, that there could not be foreign
financial support for Solidarity and that Solidarity avoid
extremist and anti-communist forces.

an official ban and demonstrated to commemorate the 1956
anti-communist uprising. Five were detained, an official report
said.
   The demonstrators toured city landmarks while about 4,000 riot
police patroled around the sites important to the revolt, according
to opposition activist Ferenc Koeszeg. He said there was no
violence.
   The official MTI news agency said five people were detained
because they refused to provide identification, lacked proper
documents, or made ``offensive statements.''
   Koeszeg identified two arrested demonstrators as Tibor Pakh and
Robert Palinkas. He said police took Pakh away as he was trying to
address a crowd and removed Palinkas as he carried a bouquet of
flowers tied by white, green and red ribbons _ the national colors.
   The demonstrators were marking the anniversary of the start of
the uprising, the bloodiest ever against Soviet control in East
bloc nations.
   As the revolt flared a new coalition government under Premier
Imre Nagy declared the country neutral and withdrew from the
Soviet-controlled Warsaw Treaty organization.
   But Janos Kadar, one of Nagy's ministers, declared his own
government and asked the Soviet Union for military support. Soviet
forces moved in and crushed the revolt, and Nagy and some of his
ministers were executed.
   Kadar became premier and nearly 200,000 Hungarians fled the
country. Sunday's demonstrators gathered for their memorial tour
even though authorities on Friday imposed a ban on any such event.
Koeszeg said an unofficial march was canceled by independent
groups, but its organizers decided to take to the streets after
learning that some people intended to defy the ban.
   
   One group that went to the Bem statue in Budapest, where the
uprising began, was turned back. The statue was encircled by police
who checked identification papers.

   An Ohio girl who disappeared six
years ago was found in an apartment in this Los Angeles area
community, and her grandfather was arrested for questioning, police
said.
   Charity Freeman, 13, of Toledo, was discovered Friday when
detectives went to see her grandfather about an automobile
repossession, said Lt. John Foster.
   The girl answered the door, he said.
   Leroy Freeman was arrested for investigation of kidnapping and
unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, Foster said.
   ``Thank goodness, this may finally be coming to an end,'' said
Victor J. Gonzalez, an attorney for the girl's mother, Karen
Creswell. ``It's been a long, long ordeal.''
   The girl was abducted in September 1982. Freeman and his
daughter had apparently argued over how Charity should be raised.
   The case gained national attention in 1985 when it was rumored
that Freeman was connected to a satanic cult in northern Ohio. The
rumor was never confirmed, and police found no evidence of occult
activity in the apartment, Foster said.
   Charity was not ``being held captive'' and appeared to be in
``good physical shape,'' he said.
   The girl was reunited with her mother over the weekend.

<HEAD>Thousands of Nicaraguans Pour into Miami Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Nicaraguans fleeing their war-torn and
economically ravaged homeland are coming to Dade County, and the
influx is straining social services, hospitals and schools,
officials said.
   The Central American nation's economy is worsening, and U.S. aid
to Contra rebels has been curtailed, leaving a bleak future for
many Nicaraguans. Heavily Latin Dade County, which includes Miami,
is a natural destination.
   As many as 300 Nicaraguans a week have been arriving in recent
months, said Perry Rivkind, district director of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   In 1980, most of the 125,000 Cubans who came to Florida in the
Mariel boat lift settled in Dade County, along with tens of
thousands of Haitians. The sudden influx caused severe social
problems. Local officials are now concerned that a similar
situation could develop with the Nicaraguans.
   ``It's going to be another Mariel,'' said Rosario Kennedy,
Miami's vice mayor. ``We've got to do something.''
   Most Nicaraguans are in a legal limbo, and county and state
officials can't obtain the federal aid that helped the county cope
with the Cubans and Haitians.
   ``Call them entrants, call them refugees, call them whatever you
want,'' but the federal government must do something, said Bobby
Bernal, county aide for refugee affairs. ``Because they will
continue to come.''
   The county said most of the estimated 75,000 to 100,000
Nicaraguans in the county didn't qualify for the federal amnesty
offered earlier this year to illegal aliens who arrived before
1982. INS has granted 5,000 of the 50,000 requests for political
asylym sought by Nicaraguans.
   The INS is issuing work permits to asylum applicants, and the
Reagan administration has decided not to deport non-criminal
Nicaraguans, even if they are here illegally. But they do not
qualify for federally funded programs such as food stamps or job
training.
   In the last three months, more Nicaraguan children have enrolled
in local schools than at any time since the 1979 leftist Sandinista
revolution, said Ralph Robinett, executive director of the Dade
School system's bilingual and and foreign education.
   From July to September, 1,653 Nicaraguans registered for the
first time, pushing their total past 10,000 in Dade schools. Many
of the students are poorly educated and need extra help.
   ``They need to have a lot of remedial help,'' Robinett said. The
schools' bilingual program isn't geared to deal with remedial needs
but instead assumes students are fluent in Spanish.
   Private efforts are being overburdened. The Nicaraguan
Assistance Center is falling behind on its bills and charity
funding is down, officials say.
   ``We do what we can,'' said the Rev. Francisco Santana, whose
Sweetwater parish, Our Lady of Divine Providence, is often a first
stop for Nicaraguans. ``But I don't know how long we can stand it.
Christianity says we can't turn them away. But the numbers are such
that we can't help them all.''

<HEAD>Protestant-Catholic Delegation from Northern Ireland to Visit U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Protestant and Roman
Catholic church leaders in Northern Ireland will make a joint
``pilgrimage of hope'' to the United States next month, it was
announced Sunday.
   The week-long visit to Boston starting Nov. 4 will be the first
by such a high-level interdenominational church group, according to
David Bleakley, secretary of the Irish Council of Churches.
   ``Our agenda is to tell the good news about Ireland and not get
mixed up in all the marginal and tribal issues that can arise,'' he
said.
   Bleakley said delegation members will include Dr. Robin Eames,
primate of the Protestant Church of Ireland; Bishop Cahal Daly,
whose Catholic diocese includes Belfast; the Presbyterian moderator
in Ireland, Dr. Godfrey Brown; the Rev. Charles Eyre, general
secretary of the Methodist Church in Ireland, and the Rev. Matthew
Wallace, a west Belfast Catholic priest.
   The group has been invited by an Anglican church near Boston
that administers a peace trust aimed at fostering reconciliation in
Ireland, Bleakley said. He did not identify the church. Boston has
a large population of Irish-Americans.
   As part of the program Daly will speak on Irish mythology, Brown
will give an address on reconciliation in Northern Ireland and
Eames will discuss what he believes the future holds in Ireland,
Bleakley said.
   ``It is really to show the Americans by our witness being there
that there is not a holy war in Ireland, but that great and
significant things are being done by Christians working together
for peace,'' he added.
   Sectarian warfare has ravaged Northern Ireland, a British
province, for more than a decade.
   Guerrillas of the predominantly Catholic Irish Republican Army
are fighting to unite the province, where Protestants outnumber
Catholics 3-2, with the mainly Catholic Republic of Ireland.

<TEXT>
   A woman who went undercover to help police
arrest the six men who were supplying her daughters with drugs says
the two are not speaking to her anymore.
   Pat Morrison, 44, also says her roommate has asked her to move,
and that she lives in fear of the people arrested Wednesday after
her work for the Dallas, Ore., Police Department.
   In spite of it all, Morrison, a mother of four and grandmother
of two, says she has no regrets. She wanted to help her grown
daughters get off drugs, and she did the only thing she could think
of _ she infiltrated the group that allegedly supplied her
daughters with drugs from a methamphetamine lab.
   ``I gave it a lot of thought because I didn't want to get the
girls in trouble,'' she said Saturday. ``I don't want 'em to have a
record ... but I kept thinking of what (drugs were) doing to my
girls.''
   Morrison said she tried the drug herself a couple of times,
mixing it with milk to disguise the smell and taste. But she didn't
like what it did to her.
   Worse yet, she was terrified by the grip drugs had on her
daughters, aged 21 and 24, who were living in their cars and
selling drugs to support their habits.
   In desperation, Morrison called authorities and offered to give
them information about the suppliers. They agreed, and Morrison
soon was making daily treks to the five-acre farm where her
daughters bought drugs.
   At first, she pretended to be looking for her daughters. Before
long, people began feeling relaxed, and eventually they started to
open up, she said.
   As they talked about their operation they didn't guess that
their words were being picked up by detectives hiding in a nearby
motor home. Morrison was recording conversations through a hidden
microphone.
   Morrison said that while she was afraid of the group, she grew
to like the friendly, quiet people at the farm.
   ``There toward the end, it was really hard to do what I did,''
she said of the two-week project.
   Morrison figured the matter would be closed once the arrests
were complete, but reports of her mission stirred media interest.
   Since then, she has had calls from a book publisher and TV movie
producers.
   Though Morrison would like to tell about her experiences, right
now she says she has more pressing problems.
   Her 3-year-old granddaughter, Aquila, needs her attention. Her
16-year-old car has broken down. And her roommate left a note for
her Saturday, asking Morrison to move because the woman fears for
her safety.
   The police are keeping an eye on Morrison, who is concerned for
her safety because four of the six men have been released on bail.
   And though her daughters are hardly speaking to her, she is
hopeful they will understand someday.
   ``I didn't know if it would help, but I had to try,'' said
Morrison. ``The police cannot do this all by themselves. Why don't
people do something about (drugs), instead of just sitting home
worrying about (them)?''

   Lloyd Bentsen and the Rev. Jesse Jackson accused Republican
nominee George Bush's campaign Sunday of injecting racism into the
presidential campaign by pounding Democrat Michael Dukakis over the
Massachusetts prison furlough issue.
   A Bush spokesman said the charge was ``absolutely ridiculous and
stems from desperation politics.''
   Dukakis attended a breakfast in Boston with Jackson and eight
other black political leaders who pledged to support the
Massachusetts governor's campaign in the remaining two weeks before
the Nov. 8 election.
   Then Dukakis flew via Wisconsin to California for a full day of
campaigning Monday for that crucial state's 47 electoral votes.
Bush and his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, took a
respite from campaigning at their Washington homes.
   The tenor and substance of the GOP ticket's campaign advertising
on television dominated the political dialogue Sunday.
   Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, told a
television interviewer he thought the Bush campaign was making a
racist appeal by focusing on Willie Horton Jr., a black convicted
murderer who escaped in 1986 from a Massachusetts prison furlough.
   In 1987, Horton brutally stabbed a white Maryland man and twice
raped his fiancee. Horton is currently imprisoned in Maryland.
   Asked if use of the Horton case constituted ``an element of
Republican racist appeal,'' Bentsen replied: ``When you add it up,
I think there is, and that's unfortunate, and I just don't want to
see this election won on that kind of packaging and that kind of
distortions.''
   Dukakis campaign vice chairman John Sasso said Dukakis agreed
with those comments.
   In Boston, Jackson avoided the word ``racist'' but said the
Horton case was one of several ``rather ugly race-conscious
signals'' sent out by the Bush campaign.
   ``There have been a number of rather blatantly race-conscious
signals that have had the impact of instilling ungrounded fear in
whites and alientation from blacks,'' Jackson told reporters after
the 90-minute breakfast with Dukakis.
   ``The use of the Willie Horton example is designed to create the
most horrible psycho-sexual fears,'' Jackson said. ``The furlough
ad with black and brown faces rotating in and out of jail, the use
of the Jackson-Dukakis ticket symbolism, which is distortion,
referring to me as a Chicago hustler ... there have been a number
of rather ugly race-conscious signals sent from that campaign.''
   Dukakis made no mention of the prison furlough issue in a short
statement after the breakfast. He said only that it had been a
``good, constructive meeting'' and that he was pleased by the black
leaders' commitment to his campaign.
   But at an airport rally in Eau Claire, Wis., Dukakis said Bush's
disavowal of a brochure being distributed in Michigan that says
Massachusetts convicts are voting for Dukakis was an inadequate
response.
   ``Disavowal isn't enough,'' Dukakis told the crowd of about 500
people. ``Let's get that stuff out of this campaign.''
   Bush campaign spokesman Mark Goodin said that for Bentsen and
Jackson ``to insinuate that the furlough issue has racial overtones
is absolutely ridiculous and stems from desperation politics.''
   Goodin said the GOP campaign's television commercials focused
not on Horton but on ``how he got out of prison.'' He said
correctly that Massachusetts granted furloughs to convicted
first-degree murderers serving life without the possibility of
parole. That policy was rescinded last spring.
   ``To insinuate that racism is involved in the furlough issue
operates from the ridiculous premise that black citizens care less
about having a monster in their neighborhoods like Willie Horton
than do white people,'' Goodin said.
   ``That is totally incorrect and an outrageous suggestion,'' he
said. ``Anyone who makes it should be ashamed of themselves.''
   Bentsen, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' said if Bush wins on the basis of such a campaign, ``I
think that'd be a tragedy, and I think that's one of the reasons
the American people will turn against them, with that kind of
campaign, and that's why I think we're going to put it all
together.''
   On the same TV program, Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole,
R-Kan., a former Bush opponent in the GOP primaries, also was asked
if the Bush campaign's Willie Horton ads were racially motivated.
   ``I don't think that's the case,'' he replied, but then added:
``I'm not involved in the Bush campaign. I can defend George Bush,
but I'm not sure I can defend every ad.''
   Kitty Dukakis, the Democratic nominee's wife, appeared on
CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' to say her husband had
``underestimated how vitriolic, how vicious, how negative those
false attacks were'' by the Bush campaign.
   She said some of the Bush campaign charges reminded her of the
``worst kind of McCarthy-like technique'' from the
communist-hunting 1950s, and of the dirty tricks of President
Nixon's election campaigns.
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program, Charles Black, media
consultant for the Bush campaign, denied that his colleagues are
running a ``dirty campaign.'' Black said that ``we've presented
assertions and facts that are all documented and that are all
true.''
   Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk said on the same program
that the Bush TV advertising campaign ``has been unprecedented in
terms of the politics of deception, deliberate distortion,
distraction from the issues that the American people are facing in
the 1990s, and disguised behind labels.''
   In other developments, a new poll conducted for the Dallas
Morning News and the Houston Chronicle showed that the Bush-Quayle
ticket led the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket among likely Texas voters by
52 percent to 42 percent.
   If Bush were pitted only against Dukakis, without regard for
their vice presidential running mates, Bush led Dukakis by 56
percent to 40 percent, according to the survey of 776 potential
voters conducted between Oct. 17 and Oct. 20.
   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage
points.

   Frightened dogs watched from the
roofless ruins of houses Sunday as thousands of people who survived
Hurricane Joan set up makeshift shelters, cleared streets and
shared their food.
   Bluefields had been celebrating its 85th anniversary with a fair
that included dancing, gambling and reggae music when warnings of
the impending hurricane began. Few believed it would be as bad as
it was.
   During the height of the storm at 3 a.m. Saturday roofs and
downed trees went flying through the air, pounded into buildings by
125 mph winds.
   As the hurricane subsided after dawn, dazed people began
appearing in the streets _ soldiers carrying elderlyn, women
carrying their children, girls carrying dolls.
   The number of buildings that still had their roofs could be
counted on the fingers of two hands: The Hotel Caribe, the radio
station, the Colombian consulate, the jail, the Moravian college
and the Roman Catholic cathedral _ part of it.
   ``Now nobody can laugh at us,'' said one impoverished survivor
in tattered clothes. ``Nobody has anything.''
   The new City Hall, dedicated only last week during the
anniversary celebration, was reduced to a roofless skeleton. So was
the Moravian church near the harbor.
   Streets were littered with the bodies of parrots, rats, bats and
dogs.
   Despite the destruction only 21 people perished in Bluefields,
said William Ramirez, a Sandinista Party official in charge of
recovery efforts. He said there were many injuries but few were
serious.
   The city, with a population of 38,000, may have been saved by
its bay, which protected it from the huge waves and tremendous
storm surge that is usually the most serious killer in hurricanes.
   The only communications with the outside were via government
radio. Telephones were out and no roads penetrate the jungle that
surrounds Bluefields.
   Authorities drafted prisoners to help clear the road to the
airport. The first relief flight from Cuba arrived shortly after
noon Sunday carrying doctors.
   Many neighborhoods in this city, populated mainly by blacks and
Indians, have American names: Brooklyn, Harlem, New York. In many
of those poor neighborhoods not one house was left standing.
   ``There isn't enough left of the houses to make a fire,'' said a
Red Cross nurse.
   There were the unlucky ones. A fishing boat that tried to escape
up a flooded river sank, killing a woman and her two children. Two
women who took shelter in the Anglican church perished when it
collapsed.
   But there was no panic, except among the children, at the height
of the storm, according to Ramirez.
   ``The people of Bluefields are valiant and never were afraid,''
he said.
   People shared what food they had. Many fishing boats were
destroyed, but others were being repaired.
   Ramirez said many people have relatives in the United States and
called on them for help. When asked what was needed, he said: ``We
need everything.''
   Nicaragua recently passed a law banning aid from the United
States to enter the country because of U.S. support for rebels, but
Ramirez said President Daniel Ortega had authorized help for
Bluefields from any part of the world.

   Several thousand people gathered Sunday
at a rally called by leftist parties and chanted slogans calling
for the resignation of President Augusto Pinochet.
   Speakers at the rally urged opposition parties to strenghten the
unity that led to Pinochet's defeat at the polls in a referendum
Oct. 5. In the balloting the voters rejected a proposal that would
have extended Pinochet's rule until 1997.
   Participants in the rally filled three blocks of a broad avenue
in western Santiago. Many urged their leaders to call a national
strike to put pressure on the 72-year-old president and army
commander to step down immediatedly. Gen. Pinochet has been
president since the coup he led that ousted elected Marxist
President Salvador Allende in 1973.
   According to Chile's constitution, an open election will be held
in December 1989 and Pinochet is due to hand power to the winner
three months later. The election was mandated after Pinochet's
defeat in the referendum.
   The opposition is seeking negotiations with the military to
speed up the transition to full democracy through an earlier
election. Pinochet has repeatedly said the constitution will not be
changed.
   Sunday's rally was called by the United Left, a six-party
coalition that includes the outlawed communists. It had been
authorized by the government and police did not interfere ith the
rally.
   Anibal Palma, president of the coalition, urged the creation of
``a wide national democratic agreement'' including both leftist and
non-leftist foes of the military regime.

<TEXT>
   The clipper schooner Pride of Baltimore II
departed on its maiden voyage Sunday, more than two years after the
original Pride sank in a sudden storm, killing four crew members.
   Like its predecessor, the vessel is modeled after those that
sailed the Chesapeake Bay in the 19th century and will visit other
cities and foreign countries as Maryland's and Baltimore's goodwill
ambassador.
   In order to meet U.S. Coast Guard safety requirements for
carrying passengers, Pride II is almost one-third larger than the
original Pride and 64 tons heavier. Unlike the first Pride, it is
equipped with a second diesel motor, separate compartments for its
12 crew members, and a modern kitchen.
   At Capt. Jan Miles' order, the crew hoisted a replica of the
15-star, 15-stripe U.S. flag that is believed to have flown over
nearby Fort McHenry during the War of 1812; the flag that tradition
holds was still flying and inspired Francis Scott Key to pen the
national anthem.
   The U.S. flag was quickly joined by the flags of Maryland and
Baltimore and a Pride of Baltimore II pennant.
   A shot was fired from a replica of a 19th century cannon on the
starboard side, and the clipper schooner pulled away. It sailed
around the harbor with all five sails unfurled as thousands of
people watched from the shore. A small armada of about 50 private
boats followed the vessel for about an hour until it sailed past
Fort McHenry and under the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
   Before it returns to Baltimore April 21, the clipper schooner is
scheduled to travel to Bermuda; Houston and Galveston, Texas; New
Orleans; Mobile, Ala.; Tampa, Fla.; Puerto Rico, Venezuela,
Colombia, Miami, Jacksonville, Fla.; Savannah, Ga.; North and South
Carolina; and Norfolk, Va.
   It was built with $4 million in donations and government money.
   The vessel was christened April 30, in memory of the captain and
three crew members who died when the Pride sank May 14, 1986, when
a sudden squall blew up 90 miles off the coast of Puerto Rico. The
eight survivors clung to a life raft for five days, rationed to a
bite of biscuit and a half cup of water daily.
   None of the original crew sailed with the Pride II on Sunday.

   A abandoned bomb in a bag exploded on
a passenger bus Sunday, officials said. Up to nine people were
injured.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack in this capital
city. Police blamed terrorists but gave no details.
   Police said the bag was placed under a seat at the rear of an
intercity bus and the explosion blew out windows and doors.
   Dr. Humayun Rizwan, reached at a local hospital, said nine
people were injured. However, police said only four people were
hurt.
   Authorities have blamed scores of bombings in Pakistan over the
past two years on agents of Afghanistan's communist government.
   Pakistan arms and supports Moslem guerrillas fighting the Kabul
government, which is backed by Soviet troops.
   The U.S. State Department reports Pakistan was the leading
target of terrorist activity during the past year. The country is
home to more than 3 million Afghan refugees.
   In the past, Islamabad has rarely been a target, but Sunday's
blast was the second there in less than a month. The earlier
explosion was small and caused no injuries or damage.
   Security has been tightened in the capital over the past year,
with more police patrolling and checkposts set up around the clock
on roads leading into the city.

<HEAD>Omaha World-Herald Endorses Bush For President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Omaha World-Herald has endorsed Vice
President George Bush over Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in
their race for the presidency.
   Bush will pursue free trade, less government spending and low
taxes, economic policies that have proven to be effective, the
state's largest newspaper said in an editorial in its Monday
editions.
   In foreign policy, Bush understands and embraces the philosophy
of peace through strength, the newspaper said.
   Dukakis offers domestic proposals that point to more government,
not less, the newspaper said. His defense and foreign policy
proposals point to a more passive, trusting role for the United
States, the newspaper argued.
   The World-Herald also said Bush has more experience than Dukakis.

   Michael Jackson visited the modest house where
Berry Gordy Jr. launched Motown and donated $125,000 Sunday for
preservation of the sound that's as much a part of Detroit as
automobiles.
   Jackson, making a rare public appearance, toured the Motown
Museum with Gordy, who called the pop superstar one of the museum's
greatest supporters.
   ``Michael Jackson knows success in life is not merely confined
to fame and fortune and material gains, but it's also found in a
continual awareness of our roots, his roots,'' said Gordy, who
founded Motown in 1959, moved it to Los Angeles in 1972 and sold it
to MCA Records for $61 million last June.
   ``These are Michael Jackson's roots, right here.''
   At least 2,500 people cheered wildly from behind a fence about
60 yards away from the museum when Jackson stepped to the
microphone.
   ``I'm very happy and proud to be back to the soil from which I
came,'' Jackson said. ``Berry Gordy is the man that made it all
possible for me. I want to say thank you, Berry, and I love you.''
   The fans endured a constant, cold rain to get a glimpse of
Jackson, who is scheduled to perform two shows this week at the
Palace of Auburn Hills.
   Motown Records recorded the music of Diana Ross and The
Supremes, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Lionel Richie and other
Motown stars.

   Bath Iron Works Corp. on Sunday launched the
fourth Aegis cruiser the shipbuilding company has built for the
U.S. Navy.
   The Monterey had been scheduled to slide down the ways on
Saturday, but heavy rain forced officials to postpone the launching.
   Capt. Joel B. Heaton, prospective commanding officer of the
ship, was presented a flag that had flown aboard the previous naval
vessel Monterey, which won 11 battle stars during service in the
Pacific during World War II.
   The new, 567-foot Monterey will carry a crew of 375 when
commissioned into the Navy's active fleet in early 1990.
   Aboard the $1-billion cruiser, which may be assigned to an
aircraft carrier battle group, is an advanced system of radar,
computers and missiles called Aegis. The word comes from the Greek
for ``shield.''
   Bath Iron Works has seven Aegis cruisers under contract.

   Typhoon Ruby struck the Philippines
Monday with winds up to 93 mph and the military said 10 people
drowned in raging flood waters.
   The storm went ashore at Samar island, 350 miles southeast of
Manila, and was expected to move northwest toward the main island
of Luzon, according to government forecaster Crisologo Enriquez.
   Storm warnings were issued in Manila, the central Visayas
islands, the north coast of Mindanao and southern and central
Luzon. The government weather service said the storm was expected
to pass near Manila late Monday afternoon.
   Rains drenched Manila late Sunday and early Monday. Officials at
Manila's Ninoy Aquino airport said 25 domestic flights were
canceled Monday. They said international flights were operating
normally.
   Schools were closed in the Manila area and southern Luzon. Red
Cross and government officials urged residents of low-lying areas
to seek shelter on higher ground.
   Military commands said at least 10 people drowned Sunday when a
tornado triggered by the approaching typhoon caused flash flooding
in six villages near Cagayan de Oro, 500 miles southeast of Manila.
   They reported 20,000 people were left homeless by the storm.
   Lourdes Masing, spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Manila, first
said the flooding took place Friday and the tornado was spawned by
Typhoon Pat, which struck the Philippines the same day.
   But later she said further reports indicated the tornado struck
before dawn Sunday and was caused by Typhoon Ruby.
   Col. Triumfo Agustin, Philippine Constabulary regional commander
in the Cagayan de Oro area, said the storm destroyed a bridge and
washed away more than 1,000 homes.
   ``We have advised the remaining residents along the river to
seek higher ground,'' he said.
   Manoling Abejuela, Cagayan de Oro's planning engineer, estimated
the damage to agricultural crops and houses in the area at $2.4
million.

   A college student and her cousin
were arrested Sunday and accused of bludgeoning her father and aunt
to death to gain an inheritance, police said.
   Laura Kaldawi, 18, was charged with two counts of conspiracy to
commit murder, said Bergen County Prosecutor Larry McClure. Her
cousin, Patrick Lanzel, 19, of Lakewood, N.Y., was charged with two
counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.
   ``The motive appears to be financial,'' McClure said.
   Samir Kaldawi, 44, a banker, and his former sister-in-law,
Georgette Kaldawi, 35, were found beaten to death with a metal pipe
Saturday in their home in this affluent New York City suburb. Samir
Kaldawi's 9-year-old son, Gregory, was critically injured.
   McClure said Lanzel is not Georgette Kaldawi's son.
   Miss Kaldawi, a freshman at Marymount College in New York, told
police she was home for a weekend visit when she found her father
and aunt dead and her brother critically injured.
   Miss Kaldawi and Lanzel were being held Sunday at the Bergen
County Jail on $1 million bail each. Arraignment was scheduled in
Superior Court on Monday.
   Gregory Kaldawi was in critical condition at Valley Hospital,
where he was treated for head injuries.

   The 1988 AP Election Service package will begin moving shortly
on this wire.
   In addition to setting the stage for Election Day, it helps you
identify the political cast and inform those who are about to vote
_ your readers, viewers and listeners. It offers a public service
to those trying to get themselves ready to vote.
   The package is slugged BC-AP Election Service.
   It covers this year's election situation for president, vice
president, the dozen races for governor, 33 races for U.S. Senate,
and 435 races for U.S. House. It also shows the governors and
senators holding offices not up for election this time.
   It opens with a summary of the situation, and follows with
countless details on the people involved, the elections, and
American history in the making.
   It is written for publication and broadcast at any time before
the balloting begins.
   It also is designed for flexibility, to display or distribute as
you see fit. It offers a range of self-contained items written for
your use individually or in whatever grouping you desire, including
tables, lists of election information, even facts from the past to
help put those of the present into perspective.
   It also serves as a detailed guide for your staff, a ready
reference as the campaigns draw to a close, the voters decide, and
the returns come in.
   
   AP Election Service information is based on reporting by AP
bureaus across America and also drawn from the computerized archive
of stories and biographical information in the AP Political Service
Databank, latest state-by-state ballot material supplied by News
Election Service, and such official sources as the Census Bureau,
the Federal Election Commission and the Congressional Research
Service of the Library of Congress.

bureau, who has been an AP reporter and editor of political,
election and government news since 1963, and with editorial
assistance from Pamela B. Schmid. Tom Jory is director of election
information in New York.

   This year's election is for the four-year presidential and vice
presidential terms starting next Jan. 20, when Republican Ronald W.

<TEXT>
   The 435-seat U.S. House of Representatives for the 101st
Congress is being elected this year. Members will serve during the
first half of the new president's administration.
   Under the Constitution, every state is entitled to one House
seat; beyond that, representatives are apportioned among the states
according to population, with figures determined on the basis of
every 10-year census.
   The term of office is two years, starting Jan. 3, 1989.
   To hold a majority, one party must win at least 218 seats.
Democrats have been in the majority in the House since the 1954
election of the 84th Congress.
   Present occupants of the House's 435 seats include 255 Democrats
and 177 Republicans, with three seats vacant.
   Here are the vacancies, and those who had held the seats: New

21; and New York's 19th District, Democrat Mario Biaggi, who

   In all, 27 House seats are open _ three are vacant, one
incumbent lost in a primary, 12 representatives are retiring at the
end of this term, seven congressmen are nominees for Senate seats,
three gave up their House seats and unsuccessfully sought
nomination for the Senate, and one congressman is a gubernatorial
nominee.
   The remaining 408 representatives campaigned for re-election.

<HEAD>The Electoral College</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Because the nation uses an Electoral College system, voters
don't directly elect the president and vice president. Instead,
Americans cast ballots for electors, apportioned among the states
and the District of Columbia.
   In this election, 538 electoral votes will be at stake in 50
states and the District of Columbia, with at least 270 electoral
votes needed to win. Electors will meet in the states and District
of Columbia on Dec. 17. Their votes will be counted Jan. 6 by a
joint session of Congress.
   Reagan won the 1984 presidential election with 54.45 million
popular votes and 525 electoral votes, beating Democrat Walter F.
Mondale who received 37.57 million popular votes and 13 electoral
votes. Reagan carried 49 states in 1984 while Mondale carried
Minnesota and the District of Columbia.
   Here's the distribution of electoral votes at stake this year:
   _47 for California.
   _36 for New York.
   _29 for Texas.
   _25 for Pennsylvania.
   _24 for Illinois.
   _23 for Ohio.
   _21 for Florida.

   Current office _ Bentsen is a U.S. senator from Texas.
   Personal, family _ Bentsen was born Feb. 11, 1921, in Mission,
Texas; lived in Starr County. His great-great-uncle was Henry
Wilson, vice president in 1873-75 during President Ulysses S.
Grant's second administration. Bentsen's father, Lloyd Sr., a son
of Danish immigrants, was a rancher who started with little money
and built a financial dynasty in land. Lloyd Bentsen Jr. and his
wife, the former Beryl Ann Longino, have three children _ Lloyd M.
III, Lan Chase, and Tina Ann.
   Education, military service _ Bentsen was educated at the
University of Texas, receiving a law degree in 1942. He was in the
Army in World War II.
   Occupations _ He practiced law. He was a business executive in
Houston, 1955-72. He headed Lincoln Consolidated, a financial
holding institution.
   Election history _ Bentsen was elected a judge of Hidalgo
County, Texas, in 1946. He was elected in November 1948 to the U.S.
Hose for the 81st Congress, then was elected the next month to
serve for the rest of the 80th Congress. That December special
election filled a vacancy in the 80th Congress caused by the death
of an incumbent who didn't run for the 81st Congress. Thus, Bentsen
began congressional service Dec. 4, 1948. He was re-elected in 1950
and 1952. He did not run again in 1954, leaving office in 1955. He
was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1970, starting service Jan. 3,
1971; and was re-elected in 1976 and 1982. He ran this year for a
new term, gaining Democratic renomination at the March 8 primary.
Bentsen announced his candidacy for the presidency on Feb. 17,
1975, and dropped out of the national race for the Democratic
nomination Feb. 10, 1976, while remaining a favorite-son candidate
in Texas. He lost to Jimmy Carter in that Texas test in May 1976.
This year, Dukakis selected Bentsen to be his vice presidential
running mate and Bentsen was nominated by acclamation at the
Democratic national convention July 21. Texas law allows Bentsen to
run both for vice president and for re-election to the Senate this
year.

   The run for the White House is actually 51 races throughout the
nation on Election Day.
   In 1984, Republican Ronald Reagan, a 49-state winner, and
Democrat Walter Mondale, second everywhere except in Minnesota and
Washington, D.C., were the top two finishers nationally and Reagan
easily retained the presidency.
   They received the majority of popular votes cast in the
individual elections in 50 states and the District of Columbia but
they didn't get them all because other candidates drew some support
here and there.
   Among those who also ran for the presidency in 1984, David
Bergland of the Libertarian Party came in third nationally with
227,204 votes.
   In detail, according to official statistics published by
Congress, here are the popular votes for Reagan and Mondale in
those 51 elections, and their percentage of the total vote for all
candidates in these races.

   Here's how many people are old enough to vote in this year's
election, and how they are spread across the United States, along
with figures on the total population.
   
   Generally, in the most recent elections when the presidency was
at stake, only about half of those who were old enough to vote
actually went to the polls.
   For example, according to the Census Bureau, turnout in the 1984
presidential election was only 53.1 percent of the voting-age
population, up from 52.6 percent in 1980.
   The bureau said turnout was 62.8 percent in 1960, 61.9 percent
in 1964, 60.9 percent in 1968, 55.1 percent in 1972, and 53.6
percent in 1976.
   
   The last census in 1980 placed the nation's total population at
226,546,000, and the next such official count will be in 1990.
   Meantime, the Census Bureau's most recent detailed estimates are
that total population reached 243,400,000 in mid-1987 and that
182,628,000 residents will be at least 18 years old when America
votes this November.
   Since the 1984 presidential election, the voting-age population
is estimated to have grown by more than 8 million.
   
   The bureau points out that voting-age projections are based on
the resident population of the United States including members of
the armed forces where they reside at their duty stations.
   It said these projections exclude people overseas _ about
520,000 in the military and 65,000 federal civilian workers plus
their dependents of voting age, and an unknown number of other
American citizens residing abroad _ who would be eligible to vote
by absentee ballot in their home state.
   Meanwhile, the bureau said that the population of voting age
includes many who meet the age requirement but cannot vote.
   Because citizenship is a universal requirement for voting,
aliens are the main group of ineligible voting-age people, the
bureau said.
   About 6.5 million legal aliens and 2.5 million undocumented
aliens age 18 or over are included in the estimates and represent
roughly 5 percent of the total population of voting age, the bureau
said.
   The bureau also said somewhat more than 680,000 people will be
ineligible to vote because they will be in prisons or mental
hospitals.
   
   Based on Census Bureau reports, here is a state-by-state list
covering:
   _Total population figures from the census on April 1, 1980.
   _An estimate of what the total population had reached on July 1,
1987, the latest available such list.
   _An estimate of this November's voting-age population (residents
aged 18 or over), from projections released in February as a
reference for the current election season.

   Americans, millions of 'em, will vote Nov. 8.
   From New England's Pine Tree State to the neighborhood of
California's Golden Gate, they'll vote.
   In the thousand towns between and even beyond, they'll vote.
   Doing their civic duty in Boston, in Austin, in the Concords,
the Springfields, Des Moines, Honolulu, Harlem, Dixville Notch.
Doing it in Shreveport. In Fairbanks. Indianapolis. They'll vote.
   And privately _ because, they're sure, the world will know soon
enough, thank you very much. Indeed it will. From the precincts
will flow the word, to the wires, to the world. One vote. One
hundred. One million. Ten million. In 1984, it reached 92,654,861.
   Now, it is Election Day 1988, and what's at stake?
   Well, for George Bush and Michael Dukakis, and for all others
who want the presidency, 538 electoral votes are the big prizes.
   Not many votes, you say? Why the big deal? Well, those votes are
the ones that pack the punch.
   Those votes, those electoral votes, the ones that make a
president, are scattered through 50 states and the District of
Columbia, and the one who wins enough of them is awarded a
temporary ticket to the White House and a permanent place in
American history.
   Beginning with the unanimous election of George Washington two
centuries ago, this is the 51st such round of balloting for the
leadership of the federal government's executive branch. Many would
say the free world.
   Term of office: four years, as usual. And if you want four more,
you'll have to try again next time, thank you very much.
   The starting date for Job No. 1's winner and co-worker, the vice
president, is Jan. 20, 1989.
   As required by the Constitution, incumbent Republican President
Reagan must vacate the White House that day, after having been
elected twice and serving eight years.
   His ticketmate in 1980 and 1984, Vice President Bush, is this
year's Republican presidential nominee, facing Democrat Dukakis,
governor of Massachusetts.
   Call it luck. Or fate. Call it what you will. Both Bush and
Dukakis were born in Massachusetts' ``county of presidents'' _
Norfolk County _ the one that already has given three of its
natives to the nation: John Adams, John Quincy Adams, and John
Fitzgerald Kennedy.
   The new president will be the 40th person to rise to the office
but will be known for all time as the nation's 41st president.
Thank you, Grover Cleveland. Because Cleveland's terms (1885-89,
1893-97) were not consecutive, he is counted as both the 22nd and
24th president.
   The new vice president will be the 44th in U.S. history. Two
U.S. senators _ Republican Dan Quayle of Indiana and Democrat Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas _ are vying for the vice presidency.
   
   Elsewhere on the ballots throughout the land:
   
   _ The office of governor is up for election in a dozen states,
including nine with four-year gubernatorial terms and three with
two-year terms.
   Present occupants of these 12 offices: 8 Republicans, 4
Democrats.
   In all, the current lineup of the 50 state governors: 27
Democrats, 23 Republicans.
   
   _ 33 U.S. Senate seats are at stake. Term of office: 6 years,
starting Jan. 3, 1989. Winners will serve in the nation's 101st,
102nd and 103rd Congresses.
   Present occupants of these 33 seats: 18 Democrats, 15
Republicans.
   Every state has two senators. In all, the current lineup in the
100-seat Senate: 54 Democrats, 46 Republicans.
   
   _ All 435 U.S. House seats will be filled. Elections will be
held in congressional districts throughout the nation.
   Under the Constitution, every state is entitled to one House
seat; beyond that, representatives are apportioned among the states
according to population, with figures determined on the basis of
every 10-year census.
   Term of office: 2 years, starting Jan. 3, 1989. Winners will
serve in the 101st Congress.
   To hold a majority, one party must win at least 218 seats.
Democrats have been in the majority in the House since the 1954
election of the 84th Congress.
   Present occupants of the House's 435 seats: 255 Democrats, 177
Republicans, with three seats vacant.
   Here are the vacancies, and those who had held the seats:
   1. New Jersey's 3rd District _ Democrat James J. Howard died
March 25.
   2. Tennessee's 2nd District _ Republican John J. Duncan died
June 21.
   3. New York's 19th District _ Democrat Mario Biaggi resigned
Aug. 5.
   Representatives must be elected; House vacancies cannot be
filled by appointment.
   
   Now, here's some more about this business of the electoral votes:
   In the election of a president and vice president, there are two
sets of votes to follow as the returns come in _ a popular vote and
an electoral vote.
   Because the United States uses the Electoral College system,
voters indirectly elect the president and vice president. Popularly
chosen electors, apportioned among the states and District of
Columbia, are the ones who officially vote for the candidates.
   Electoral votes usually go to the statewide winner of the
popular vote. Technically, an elector is a free agent. But only in
a few cases have electors gone off on their own to vote for someone
else.
   The number of electors equals each state's delegation in the
U.S. Senate and U.S. House. Currently, for example, California has
two U.S. senators and 45 U.S. representatives, so it has 47
electoral votes.
   The District of Columbia, meantime, gets three electors although
it has no U.S. senators and no voting representative in the U.S.
House. Under the 23rd Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in
1961, D.C.'s electoral votes equal the number provided to the least
populous state.
   At least 270 electoral votes are needed for victory. Electors
will vote Dec. 17 and those votes will be counted Jan. 6 at a joint
session of Congress. The winning presidential and vice presidential
candidates then take office Jan. 20.

   Going into the election of a dozen governors this year, the
political split among the nation's 50 state chief executives is 27
Democrats and 23 Republicans.
   This became the lineup in April when Democrat Rose P. Mofford
automatically became Arizona's governor with the state Senate's
conviction of Evan Mecham, a Republican who had been elected
governor in 1986, of ``high crimes, misdemeanors and malfeasance in
office.''
   Mrs. Mofford, next in line as secretary of state, had become
acting governor Feb. 5 when Mecham was impeached by the Arizona
House. She became governor when the state Senate convicted Mecham
on April 4, and she took the oath of office the next day.
   The last time Republicans were in a majority among the governors
was with the election of 1969, a GOP record of 32 governors.
   Democrats have dominated the executive mansions since 1970,
reaching 37 in 1976 and 1977.
   Since 1960, here were the total political lineups for governor,
generally reflecting the immediate result of that year's
gubernatorial elections, with most newly elected governors taking
office the next year.
   The 1968 figures reflect a Democrat eventually becoming governor
in Maryland replacing a Republican who was that year's Vice
President-elect Spiro Agnew.
   The independent governor listed here was Maine's James B.
Longley.

<HEAD>U.S. House elections</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   The 435-seat U.S. House of Representatives for the 101st
Congress is being elected this year. Members will serve during the
first half of the new president's administration.
   The House elections, in districts throughout the nation, are for
two-year terms opening Jan. 3, 1989.
   Every state gets at least one seat in the House. Beyond that,
representatives are apportioned among the states according to
population, with the size the state's delegation determined based
on every 10-year census.
   States with more than one U.S. House member are split into
congressional districts, and candidates run only in the district
they seek to represent.
   Based on the 1980 census, California, with 45 seats, has the
largest House delegation, New York is second with 34, and Texas is
third with 27.
   The 1st Congress opened March 4, 1789; George Washington began
his presidency the following April 30, and the terms of other early
presidents routinely began on March 4. However, the 20th Amendment
to the Constitution, ratified in 1933, revised the starting dates
of the terms.
   Beginning in 1935 for the 74th Congress, the starting date for
legislative terms became Jan. 3, and, beginning in 1937, during
President Franklin Roosevelt's administration, the opening day for
a president's term was changed to Jan. 20.
   Throughout American history, seats were added to the House as
states joined the union. There were 234 representatives for the
34th Congress (1855-57). With the 63rd Congress (1913-15), the
House had 435 members. The House went to a temporary 436 members
for the 86th Congress (1959-61), reached 437 in the 87th Congress
(1961-63), and returned to 435 starting with the 88th Congress
(1963-65).
   Democrats have been in the majority in the House since the 1954
election of the 84th Congress (1955-57).
   The House for the 65th Congress (1917-19) was organized by
Democrats with other party help. For the 72nd Congress (1931-33),
the House was organized by Democrats because of deaths among
Republicans.
   For recent Congresses, here are the election years, the number
of the Congress involved in that election, the years of that
Congress, and the political division of the House in that Congress.
The figures are compiled from official sources.
   The political division generally reflects the immediate result
of the elections. Note that with the admission of Alaska and Hawaii
to the union, there was a temporary expansion of the House to 436
seats in the 86th Congress and 437 in the 87th Congress. After
that, the House returned to 435 seats.
   In 1980, the ``other'' winner was an independent candidate who
eventually sided with the Democrats, increasing their total to 243.

   6. NORTH CAROLINA _ Republican James G. Martin, of Raleigh, was
born Dec. 11, 1935.
   Term: 4 years.
   First elected: 1984.
   Election history: In 1984, Martin, as a six-term congressman,
overpowered Democrat Rufus L. Edmisten, the state's attorney
general, gaining 54.3 percent of the vote and winning election as
North Carolina's second GOP governor in this century. Incumbent
Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., serving a second term, North Carolina's
legal limit, was required to retire from office. Before running for
governor, Martin had been elected to the U.S. House in 1972 and won
new terms in 1974, 1976, 1978, 1980 and 1982.
   
   
   7. NORTH DAKOTA _ Democrat George A. ``Bud'' Sinner, of
Bismarck, was born May 29, 1928.
   Term: 4 years.
   First elected: 1984.
   Election history: In 1984, Sinner, a state legislator and
farmer, who had lost a 1964 campaign for a U.S. House seat, emerged
the winner of a tough and often bitter fight for governor. Sinner
drew 55.3 percent of the vote, defeating Republican Gov. Allen I.
Olson. Sinner had failed in 1972 to receive his party's endorsement
to run for governor; instead, the Democrats picked Arthur A. Link,
a congressman, as their nominee, and Link was elected governor in a
close race against Republican Lt. Gov. Richard Larsen. Link won a
second term in 1976, but was beaten by Olson in 1980.
   
   
   8. RHODE ISLAND _ Republican Edward D. DiPrete, of Cranston, was
born July 8, 1934.
   Term: 2 years.
   First elected: 1984.
   Election history: In 1984, DiPrete, after many years in Cranston
government including service as mayor, was elected governor with 60
percent of the vote, giving the GOP a rare victory in Rhode Island
gubernatorial races in the period since World War II. DiPrete
whipped Democrat Anthony J. Solomon, the state's general treasurer,
for the office given up by Democratic Gov. J. Joseph Garrahy, who
retired. DiPrete, drawing 64.7 percent of the vote, picked up a
second term with his victory in 1986 over Democrat Bruce G.
Sundlun, a broadcast executive. Before becoming governor, DiPrete
was elected Cranston's mayor in 1978 and won re-election in 1982.
   
   
   9. UTAH _ Republican Norman H. Bangerter, of Salt Lake City, was
born Jan. 4, 1933.
   Term: 4 years.
   First elected: 1984.
   Election history: In 1984, Bangerter, following a decade in the
Utah Legislature including duty as House speaker, attracted 55.9
percent of the vote and won election as the state's first
Republican governor in 20 years. Popular Democratic Gov. Scott M.
Matheson retired instead of seeking a new term, and the party
picked Wayne Owens, a former congressman, as its gubernatorial
candidate. Bangerter, meantime, emerged with the GOP nomination by
beating Dan Marriott, a four-term congressman. In the showdown,
Bangerter whipped Owens by more than 76,000 votes out of nearly
630,000 cast.
   
   
   10. VERMONT _ Democrat Madeleine M. Kunin, of Montpelier, was
born Sept. 28, 1933.
   Term: 2 Years.
   First elected: 1984.
   Election history: In 1984, Kunin, a Swiss-born writer and
teacher who served in the Vermont Legislature and twice was elected
lieutenant governor, narrowly won the gubernatorial race. She
emerged with 50.026 percent of the vote, edging Republican John J.
Easton Jr., a two-term state attorney general, by just 3,674 votes
out of 233,753 cast for the field of five candidates on the ballot
and assorted write-ins. She had been elected lieutenant governor in
1978 and was re-elected in 1980, then lost the 1982 gubernatorial
race to Republican Gov. Richard A. Snelling, who retired instead of
running again in 1984. In her bid for re-election in 1986, Kunin
drew 46.992 percent of the vote, topping Republican Peter Smith,
Vermont's lieutenant governor, and independent Bernard Sanders,
Burlington's mayor. Because Vermont law requires a majority vote
for governor, the Legislature made the decision in January 1987,
giving her the victory with 139 votes to 39 for Smith and one for
Sanders.
   
   
   11. WASHINGTON _ Democrat Booth Gardner, of Olympia, was born
Aug. 21, 1936.
   Term: 4 years.
   First elected: 1984.
   Election history: In 1984, Gardner, a former state senator who
had been elected Pierce County executive in 1980, won the
governor's office with 53.3 percent of the vote, ousting Republican
Gov. John Spellman. Gardner, an heir to the Weyerhaeuser timber
fortune but a man who would rather drive a not-very-new car and buy
his suits right off the rack, won the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination by beating state Sen. James McDermott, who had been the
party's 1980 nominee. Gardner overpowered Spellman by 124,999 votes
out of 1,888,987 cast.
   
   
   12. WEST VIRGINIA _ Republican Arch A. Moore Jr., of Charleston,
was born April 16, 1923.
   Term: 4 years.
   First elected: 1968.
   Election history: In 1968, Moore, a congressman since 1957, was
elected governor with 50.9 percent of the vote, beating James M.
Sprouse, the state Democratic chairman, for the office given up by
Democrat Hulett C. Smith. Smith could not seek a new term that
year. Moore was re-elected in 1972, with 54.7 percent of the vote,
beating Democrat John D. ``Jay'' Rockefeller IV, West Virginia's
secretary of state at the time. Moore was in his second consecutive
term, the state's legal limit, and could not try again in 1976. In
1978, Moore ran for the U.S. Senate and lost to incumbent Democrat
Jennings Randolph. Moore lost the 1980 gubernatorial race to
then-incumbent Rockefeller. In 1984, the two-term limit forced
Rockefeller to give up the governor's office; instead, he ran for
the U.S. Senate and won. Moore again was elected governor in 1984,
drawing 53.3 percent of the vote in topping Democrat Clyde M. See
Jr., speaker of the West Virginia House. Before becoming governor,
Moore lost a 1954 race for a U.S. House seat, then came back to win
election to the House in 1956 and re-election in 1958, 1960, 1962,
1964 and 1966.

<HEAD>100 United States Senators</HEAD>

   Here is a look at the 100 U.S. senators:
   
   _ The political lineup going into this year's election: 54
Democrats, 46 Republicans.
   _ Terms: 6 years.
   _ Beginning of terms in the 33 seats at stake in this year's
election: Jan. 3, 1989.
   For candidates winning their first election to the Senate, that
will be the day they start their new job. For re-elected senators
or appointed ones who win election, that will be the day their
seniority is extended without interruption.
   For this year's winners who are former senators, those who had
left the job when they either retired, resigned or were forced out
of office because they lost at the polls, that will be the day they
return to the Senate.
   _ Congresses: Winners of this year's election will serve in the
nation's 101st, 102nd and 103rd Congresses.
   _ Senate seniority: Democrat John C. Stennis of Mississippi, who
began serving Nov. 5, 1947, ranks No. 1 in seniority among the
present senators.
   With Democrats in the majority, Stennis is president pro tempore
_ president for the time being _ of the Senate. The vice president
of the United States is the Senate's president under the
Constitution; when the vice president is absent, the president pro
tempore presides over the chamber.
   Stennis is retiring from the Senate instead of seeking another
six-year term in this year's election.
   _ Last change in Senate lineup: Republican David K. Karnes of
Nebraska, appointed by Republican Gov. Kay A. Orr, was sworn into
office March 13, 1987. As the newest senator, Karnes, who is
seeking election this year, ranks last in seniority among the
current members.
   Karnes filled a vacancy created by the death of Sen. Edward
Zorinsky, a Democrat, on March 6, 1987.
   According to Senate records, tracing the membership since the
first quorum was established April 6, 1789, Karnes is the 1,782nd
U.S. senator in American history.
   _ Senate size: Two seats are given to each state, as ordered by
the Constitution, meaning the Senate automatically grows when a
state joins the union. So, because the nation has 50 states now,
the Senate has 100 seats.
   _ Senate elections: Races are run on a schedule that spreads the
action evenly every two years, putting 33 seats at stake in one
election year, another 33 in the next election year, and the final
34 in the last year of the regular cycle.
   _ The 33 seats up for election this year are now held by: 18
Democrats, 15 Republicans.
   _ The 67 seats not up for election this year are held by: 36
Democrats, 31 Republicans.
   _ Senators, by sex: 98 male, 2 female.
   The women in the Senate are Republican Nancy Landon Kassebaum of
Kansas and Democrat Barbara Ann Mikulski of Maryland. Two is the
record for the most women serving there at the same time.
   In all, throughout history, 16 women _ 9 Democrats and 7
Republicans _ have been either appointed or elected to the Senate.
   In 1922, the first woman senator, Georgia Democrat Rebecca
Latimer Felton, was appointed by the governor Oct. 3 to fill a
vacancy created Sept. 26 by the death of Democratic Sen. Thomas
Watson, and she was sworn in Nov. 21. Because her successor,
Democrat Walter George, who had been elected Nov. 7 and took office
Nov. 22, purposely delayed presenting his credentials, she got a
chance to take the oath and make a speech on the floor.
   The first woman elected to the Senate was Arkansas Democrat
Hattie Wyatt Caraway. She first entered the Senate Nov. 13, 1931,
when she was appointed by the governor after the death of her
husband, Sen. Thaddeus Caraway. On Jan. 12, 1932, she was elected
to complete the unexpired term. She was re-elected in November 1932
and in 1938, and completed service in January 1945.
   _ Senators, by race: There are no blacks among the 100 senators.
   The last black to serve in the U.S. Senate was Republican Edward
William Brooke of Massachusetts. He was elected in 1966, began
serving Jan. 3, 1967; was re-elected in 1972; was defeated Nov. 7,
1978, in his bid for a third term, and left office Jan. 2, 1979.
   Brooke was the first black in the Senate since the nation's
Reconstruction after the Civil War, and only the third black
senator _ all of them Republicans _ in American history. He also
was the first black elected to the Senate by popular vote, and the
first to win a second term.
   Two blacks went to the Senate after the Civil War, having been
elected by the Mississippi Legislature. The first black senator _
and the first black member of Congress _ was Hiram Rhodes Revels of
Mississippi, who served after the state was readmitted to
representation in Congress in 1870.
   Revels took his Senate seat in February 1870 and served for a
term expiring March 3, 1871. The first black to serve a full
six-year term in the Senate was Blanche Kelso Bruce of Mississippi;
he held office from March 4, 1875, to March 3, 1881.
   In 1959, Democrat Daniel Ken Inouye of Hawaii was elected to the
U.S. House July 28 and began serving Aug. 21 as the first U.S.
representative of Japanese ancestry. He was first elected in 1962
to the U.S. Senate, where he started service Jan. 3, 1963.
   Democrat Spark Masayuki Matsunaga of Hawaii, a Japanese-American
who first won a U.S. House seat in 1962, was elected to the U.S.
Senate for the first time in 1976 and began service Jan. 3, 1977.
   
   
   
   Here is a look at the class of '88 _ the senators holding the 33
seats up for election this year, including six senators retiring
instead of seeking new terms:
   
   
   1. ARIZONA _ Democrat Dennis DeConcini, of Tucson, was born May
8, 1937.
   First elected: 1976.
   Began serving: Jan. 3, 1977.
   Election history: In 1976, DeConcini, a former county
prosecutor, was elected to the Senate with 54 percent of the vote,
beating Republican Sam Steiger, a congressman, for the seat vacated
by retiring Republican Paul Fannin. DeConcini got 400,334 votes to
Steiger's 321,236. DeConcini picked up 56.9 percent of the vote in
winning re-election in 1982 when he whipped Republican Peter Dunn,
a state legislator, who had claimed the Democratic incumbent was
too liberal for Arizona. DeConcini came away with 411,970 votes
while Dunn drew 291,749. Before coming to the Senate, DeConcini was
Pima County attorney, 1973-76.
   
   
   2. CALIFORNIA _ Republican Pete Wilson, of San Diego, was born
Aug. 23, 1933.
   First elected: 1982.
   Began serving: Jan. 3, 1983.
   Election history: In 1982, Wilson, who had been elected San
Diego's mayor three times, retained for the GOP a Senate seat being
given up by S.I. Hayakawa, who retired. Wilson first captured the
Republican nomination by overpowering a dozen rivals including
Congressmen Paul McCloskey, Barry Goldwater Jr. and Robert Dornam,
and President Reagan's daughter Maureen. Then Wilson won the
election with 51.53 percent of the vote, topping then-Gov. Edmund
G. Brown Jr., the Democratic nominee. Out of 7.8 million votes cast
in a multicandidate contest, Wilson received 4,022,565 to Brown's
3,494,968. Earlier, Wilson was elected mayor of San Diego in 1971
and was re-elected in 1975 and 1979. In 1978, Wilson lost a bid for
the GOP gubernatorial nomination.
   
   
   3. CONNECTICUT _ Republican Lowell P. Weicker Jr., of Greenwich,
was born May 16, 1931.
   First elected: 1970.
   Began serving: Jan. 3, 1971.
   Election history: In 1970, Weicker, an heir to the Squibb drug
fortune, won election to the Senate and took over the seat that had
been held by Democrat Thomas J. Dodd, who was censured by the
Senate in 1967 for using campaign money to pay personal bills.
Democrats picked Joseph D. Duffey, leader of Americans for
Democratic Action, as their nominee in 1970 and Dodd sought
re-election as an independent. Weicker came up with 41.7 percent of
the vote, while Duffey got 33.8 percent and Dodd drew 24.5 percent.
In 1976, Weicker won a second term, grabbing 57.7 percent of the
vote and beating Democrat Gloria Schaffer, Connecticut's secretary
of state. Weicker gained GOP renomination at the state convention
in 1982, defeating Prescott Bush Jr., brother of Vice President
George Bush, then captured a third term by drawing 50.39 percent of
the vote and beating Democrat Anthony Toby Moffett, a congressman.
Before becoming a senator, Weicker won a U.S. House term in 1968.

   24. RHODE ISLAND _ Republican John H. Chafee, of Warwick, was
born Oct. 22, 1922.
   First elected: 1976.
   Began serving: Dec. 29, 1976.
   Election history: In 1976, Chafee, a former three-term Rhode
Island governor who lost his 1968 gubernatorial re-election race,
finally won a Senate seat. It was his second attempt to join the
Senate and yet another in a series of election races for Chafee.
After serving in the Rhode Island Legislature, he was elected
governor in 1962, unseating Democrat John A. Notte Jr. Chafee won
by just 398 votes out of 327,506 cast. He then picked up new
two-year terms in 1964 and 1966, but failed when he reached for No.
4 in 1968. Shortly after that gubernatorial election loss to
Democrat Frank Licht, Chafee went to Washington to join the Nixon
administration as Navy secretary. After serving in that post from
January 1969 to May 1972, he returned to Rhode Island and tried to
knock Democrat Claiborne Pell out of the Senate in 1972. Chafee
lost that election to Pell by 32,952 votes out of more than 413,400
cast. When Democrat John O. Pastore, a senator since Dec. 19, 1950,
decided to retire instead of running anew in 1976, Chafee was
elected with 57.7 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Richard
P. Lorber, an automobile dealer. After the election, Pastore
resigned and the governor appointed Chafee to serve the last days
of Pastore's term. Chafee was re-elected in 1982, drawing 51.2
percent of the vote in beating Democrat Julius C. Michaelson, a
former Rhode Island attorney general. Chafee won by 8,212 votes out
of nearly 342,800 cast.
   
   
   25. TENNESSEE _ Democrat James R. Sasser, of Nashville, was born
Sept. 30, 1936.
   First elected: 1976.
   Began serving: Jan. 3, 1977.
   Election history: In 1976, Sasser, an attorney making his first
bid for public office after having been long active in Tennessee
Democratic circles, took on Republican Sen. William E. Brock and
defeated him by 77,949 votes out of more than 1.43 million cast.
Brock, heir to a fortune flowing from candy, went on to serve as
GOP national chairman and helped overhaul the party. Sasser became
a critic of President Reagan's economic policies and picked up a
second Senate term with 61.9 percent of the vote. Republicans
offered five-term Congressman Robin L. Beard Jr. as their Senate
candidate in 1982 and he called Sasser a big spender who helped get
``our economy in the shape it is in.'' Sasser claimed Beard ``spent
the entire campaign being negative _ running some of the most
repulsive and misleading political ads'' in history. Out of nearly
1.26 million votes cast, Sasser topped Beard by 300,471.
   
   
   26. TEXAS _ Democrat Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr., of Starr County, was
born Feb. 11, 1921. This year, he was renominated for the Senate at
the Texas Democratic primary March 8. Later, at the Democratic
National Convention July 21, he also was nominated to run for the
vice presidency on the party's national ticket with presidential
nominee Michael S. Dukakis. In such cases, Texas law allows a
candidate to run for both offices at once, just as Lyndon B.
Johnson did in 1960.
   First elected: 1970.
   Began serving: Jan. 3, 1971.
   Election history: In 1970, Bentsen, again riding the Texas
political trail after sitting in the House in 1948-55 and then
giving it all up to be a businessman, upset liberal Sen. Ralph W.
Yarborough in the Democratic primary and grabbed a Senate seat with
53.3 percent of the vote. Bentsen's GOP rival was one George Bush,
a congressman back then, and the voters lined up: 1,226,568 for
Bentsen, 1,071,234 for Bush, 1,808 for others. Flash forward. Bush
is vice president, Bentsen's a Senate power, and they're together
again yet still apart on the ballot: Bush for president, Bentsen
for vice president. Not only that, but what you are about to read
is legal in Texas: It's also Bentsen for Senate again. In 1960,
Lone Star law let Texan Lyndon B. Johnson ride again for the
Senate, and he beat Republican John G. Tower _ and it also let him
share the Democrats' national horse with John F. Kennedy, who rode
up front, when they carried Texas with 50.5 percent of the popular
vote and won the presidency and vice presidency. Johnson became No.
2. That Senate seat he wanted to keep in 1960, just in case the
national horse didn't make it, was given up by him when the horse
came through. And that seat was won by Tower at a 1961 special
election and remains Republican even today, now occupied by Phil
Gramm. Bentsen, after beating Bush in 1970, faced Republican
congressmen each time he wanted six more Senate years. Bentsen won
in 1976, with 56.8 percent of the vote, against Alan Steelman, and
in 1982, with 58.6 percent, against James Collins. This time, it's
another GOP congressman, Beau Boulter, between Bentsen and another
term. And if Bentsen, like Johnson, wins both races, takes the vice
presidency and thus quits as senator, it means Bush didn't win the
White House, is available for other things come Jan. 20, and the
Republican governor must decide what next. Bush for senator? Or
Boulter? Will the governor punt to the voters on first down? Will
he take the ball and hide? Do Texans love this sort of thing? Is
winter hot in Texas? How hot will this one be?

   27. UTAH _ Republican Orrin G. Hatch, of Salt Lake City, was
born March 22, 1934.
   First elected: 1976.
   Began serving: Jan. 3, 1977.
   Election history: In 1976, Hatch, a lawyer launching his Utah
political career in an impressive way, snapped up 55.6 percent of
the vote and upset Democrat Frank E. Moss, who has been a senator
since Jan. 3, 1959. Hatch, a conservative running as an opponent of
big government and what he branded poor fiscal policies, won the
GOP nomination over Jack Carlson, a former assistant secretary of
the interior. Moss was chairman of what then was the Aeronautical
and Space Sciences Committee and contended he had reached the most
productive part of his Senate career. He said he thought ``that
once having put your hand to the plow, you should continue to the
end of the row.'' But Hatch ran away from Moss at the polls.
Republicans gained control of the Senate with the 1980 elections
and Hatch, still a first-termer, became head of the Labor and Human
Resources Committee. Campaigning from that position of power, Hatch
was unchallenged in the 1982 GOP primary and surged to a second
term against Democrat Ted Wilson, Salt Lake City's mayor, 309,332
votes to 219,482. Hatch had tied himself closely to President
Reagan's economic policy in an appeal to the state's largely
conservative electorate and it paid off in his
stronger-than-expected showing in an expensive race with Wilson.
The tide that returned the Democrats to the Senate majority in the
elections of 1986 also washed away Hatch's chairmanship but he
remained the top Republican on the Labor and Human Resources
Committee.
   
   
   28. VERMONT _ Republican Robert T. Stafford, of Rutland, was
born Aug. 8, 1913. Instead of running again this year, Stafford is
retiring from office. He announced his decision April 10, 1987.
   First elected: 1972.
   Previously appointed: 1971.
   Began serving: Sept. 16, 1971.
   Election history: In 1972, Stafford won a January special
election to keep the seat he had obtained by appointment of the GOP
governor in 1971 to fill a vacancy created by the death of
Republican Winston L. Prouty. By the time he reached the Senate,
Vermont voters knew Stafford well because he had been on their
ballots and won every two years since back in the 1950s. When the
nation was younger and slimmer, Vermont occupied six of the 186
U.S. House seats available based on America's 1810 census. But by
the time Stafford first won a House election in 1960, Vermont had
long ago slipped to the constitutional floor _ it was a single-seat
state. So, when they saw his name, voters cared not whether it was
on the line for governor, U.S. House or U.S. Senate. The real
question was: Do we want to send him where he wants to go?
Stafford's wish and the voters' majority will were one from start
to finish, it was close at times but they always decided to go with
him. Last year, he decided the time had come to retire instead of
running this year. The voters had elected him governor in 1958,
making him No. 1 in Vermont, elected him congressman in 1960, 1962,
1964, 1966, 1968, and 1970, making him one among 435, and elected
him senator in January 1972, approving the GOP governor's decision
to make Stafford one of the 100. When Stafford ran for a full
Senate term in 1976, Democratic Gov. Thomas P. Salmon tried to
unseat him. Stafford won by nearly 8,800 votes out of more than
189,000 cast. Six years later, Stafford had a serious primary test
but was renominated over Stewart M. Ledbetter, a former banking and
insurance commissioner who had been the 1980 GOP Senate nominee.
For the fall, Democrats went with James A. Guest, a former Vermont
secretary of state, and the voters favored Stafford by just over
5,100 votes out of about 168,000 cast. When he announced in 1987
that he would not seek re-election in 1988, Stafford declared:
``There is considerable work still ahead for me. I would only
suggest that the writing of my political obituary be put off until
that work is finished.''
   
   
   29. VIRGINIA _ Republican Paul S. Trible Jr., of Kilmarnock, was
born Dec. 29, 1946. Instead of running again this year, Trible is
retiring from this office. He announced his decision Sept. 19,
1987. On July 30, 1988, Trible declared his candidacy for the
Republican nomination for governor of Virginia in 1989.
   First elected: 1982.
   Began serving: Jan. 3, 1983.
   Election history: In 1982, Trible, a three-term congressman, won
what some old-timers still see as the Byrd seat, the one from
Virginia that passed from father to son, all in the family for 50
years, father resigning due to illness and son retiring after
saying he'd held it ``long enough.'' Trible surprised many by
revealing he wanted out after just six years. Senate life's just
not for me, said Trible, family life, Virginia life, that's my
life. ``For all the Senate's greatness,'' he said, ``much of the
important work of the nation doesn't seem to get done. The
committee hearings, debates, filibusters and roll call votes go on
and on and on. Personally, I want to be better able to shape my
day, set the agenda, do more for my family and for Virginia.'' A
little later, leaving his door ajar to life after the Senate,
Trible said he still enjoys politics and ``I love beating
Democrats.'' Thus, it stunned only a few this year when Trible
declared his candidacy for governor of Virginia next year. Trible's
triple political play, if he pulls it off, would find him moving
from six House years to six Senate years to four-and-out in
Richmond, where as governor he could not succeed himself, while the
Byrds were a half-century in a single Senate seat. Harry Flood Byrd
Jr. was appointed to the Senate by then-Gov. Albertis Harrison Jr.
in November 1965, replacing Harry Flood Byrd who had resigned,
because of illness, after serving since 1933. Harry F. Byrd Jr., as
a Democrat, was elected in 1966 to complete the rest of his
father's term, then was re-elected _ as an independent _ in 1970
and 1976. Instead of seeking re-election in 1982, Harry F. Byrd Jr.
decided to retire. Trible then won the seat, beating Democrat
Richard J. Davis, Virginia's lieutenant governor, by 33,732 votes
out of 1,415,622 cast.

   30. WASHINGTON _ Republican Daniel J. Evans, of Olympia, was
born Oct. 16, 1925. Instead of running again this year, Evans is
retiring from office. He announced his decision Oct. 20, 1987.
   First elected: November 1983.
   Previously appointed: September 1983.
   Began serving: Sept. 12, 1983.
   Election history: In 1983, Evans, who had served three terms as
governor of Washington, won a special election Nov. 8 to continue
serving in the seat to which he had been appointed in September,
filling the vacancy caused by the death of Democratic Sen. Henry M.
Jackson. Evans won the special election with 55.4 percent of the
vote, defeating Democrat Michael E. Lowry, a congressman who did
not have to give up his House seat to join the Senate race. Before
coming to the Senate, Evans had been elected Washington's governor
in 1964, ousting incumbent Democrat Albert D. Rosellini, and won
re-election in 1968 and 1972. Earlier, Evans was elected to the
Washington House in 1956 and was re-elected in 1958, 1960 and 1962.
Evans was the keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention
in 1968. He was president of Evergreen State College in Olympia,
1977-83. Jackson, who had been a senator since Jan. 3, 1953, and
had won another six-year term in 1982, died Sept. 1, 1983, after a
blood vessel near his heart ruptured. Evans, coming out of
political retirement, was appointed by Republican Gov. John
Spellman to fill the vacancy, then followed up by winning the
special election to complete the term. In October 1987, citing what
he called ``fundamentally personal'' reasons, Evans announced he
was not a candidate for re-election in 1988. He spoke of his
frustrations in the Senate, the cost and length of campaigning, and
his desire to return to backpacking and mountain-climbing in
Washington state.
   
   
   31. WEST VIRGINIA _ Democrat Robert C. Byrd, of Sophia, was born
Nov. 20, 1917.
   First elected: 1958.
   Began serving: Jan. 3, 1959.
   Election history: In 1958, Byrd, after serving in the West
Virginia Legislature and three terms in the U.S. House, was elected
to the Senate with 59.2 percent of the vote, ousting incumbent
Republican Chapman Revercomb. Byrd, gaining a reputation as an
expert legislative technician, paying close attention to details,
checking and checking again, went on to re-election in 1964, 1970,
1976 and 1982, becoming a leader of the Senate's Democrats. Byrd
thus worked his way up from extreme poverty in West Virginia to
extensive power in Washington. Byrd, who was born Cornelius Calvin
Sale Jr. in North Wilkesboro, N.C., was a child when his mother
died in an influenza epidemic. His father, a furniture maker, sent
him to live with an uncle and aunt, Titus and Vlurma Byrd, on a
farm near Crab Orchard, W.Va. The farm yielded little and the elder
Byrd worked as a $2-a-day coal miner. The Byrds did not tell the
boy he was adopted until he was 16. He worked in various jobs,
including a butcher in a market. He was elected to the West
Virginia House in 1946 and re-elected in 1948. He was elected to
the West Virginia Senate in 1950. He won election to the U.S. House
in 1952 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1956.
   
   
   32. WISCONSIN _ Democrat William Proxmire, of Madison, was born
Nov. 11, 1915. Instead of running again this year, Proxmire is
retiring from office. He announced his decision Aug. 27, 1987.
   First elected: August 1957.
   Began serving: Aug. 28, 1957.
   Election history: In 1957, Proxmire, a constant campaigner since
1950 when he won a seat in Wisconsin's Legislature, was elected to
the Senate at a special election Aug. 27, gaining 56.4 percent of
the vote, to complete the term of the late Republican Joseph R.
McCarthy. Proxmire had lost three consecutive gubernatorial
elections _ in 1952, 1954 and 1956 _ before he surprisingly scored
a victory by more than 122,000 votes in the special Senate
election, defeating Republican Walter J. Kohler Jr., a former
governor; and other candidates. Proxmire had been defeated by
Kohler in the 1952 and 1954 gubernatorial elections and had lost
the 1956 governor's race to Republican Vernon W. Thomson. After
winning the Senate seat, he gained full terms in 1958, 1964, 1970,
1976 and 1982. He became nationally known as the senator who handed
out what he termed a ``golden fleece of the month,'' poking fun at
assorted projects that he considered to be a waste of the
government's money. He also was the first senator to have a hair
transplant. He was a senator who liked to run miles to and from
work. At various times, Proxmire was described as a loner, as
anti-social, and an eccentric _ and, he once said in an interview,
``all of those things are true,'' then he quickly added: ``I don't
like the term eccentric because it implies that you are off your
rocker. I call myself a pragmatic eclectic. I want to pursue the
means that are the most appropriate at the time. I don't believe in
being doctrinaire.'' In 1987, Proxmire said of the Senate: ``Where
else can you not only dream of the direction the country is going
but play a significant part in getting it there.'' He made it clear
he loved being a senator. ``We are given a chance not just to play
in the big league but to work in the biggest league of them all _
the policy-making body of the greatest country in the world. For
anyone looking for a career that offers the greatest prospect for a
fulfilling life, how can you beat it? How lucky can you get?'' In
announcing his decision to retire, he cited his age but said he was
in good health, and added: ``This is a very, very difficult
decision, believe me.''
   
   
   33. WYOMING _ Republican Malcolm Wallop, of Big Horn, was born
Feb. 27, 1933.
   First elected: 1976.
   Began serving: Jan. 3, 1977.
   Election history: In 1976, Wallop won election to the Senate
with 54.6 percent of the vote, whipping Democrat Gale W. McGee, who
had been a senator since Jan. 3, 1959. McGee, who was chairman of
what was then the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee,
was upset by Wallop, who at the time was a Wyoming state senator.
Wallop had made an unsuccessful bid for the 1974 Wyoming Republican
gubernatorial nomination. Out of 155,368 votes cast in the 1976
Senate race, Wallop defeated McGee by 14,252 votes and said the
voters ``put their faith in a long shot, because I represented what
they felt.'' McGee, in defeat, said: ``My record was strong and
deeply dedicated to the best interest of Wyoming and that's all you
can do. If the people decide they want to try something else,
that's what the system is all about.'' Wallop came from a family of
pioneers; his ancestors settled and ranched in Wyoming, and a
grandfather had served in both the English House of Lords and the
Wyoming Legislature. Wallop won a second term in 1982 with 56.7
percent of the vote against Democrat Rodger McDaniel, a former
state senator.

   Votes. Votes. Votes. Officially, the way it
works, there are ``electors'' and ``tellers'' and such. Names and
numbers are everywhere. Jefferson and Burr. Lincoln and Eisenhower.
There are the ``gentlemen and gentlewomen of the Congress.'' It is
a song of the casters and the counters, a song of votes and 200
years of freedom and responsibility. It tells of when George won
'em all. George Washington, that is. Listen now. They're getting
ready to sing that song again.

   And so another election will end.
   If it's close, get out your scorecard.
   If it's not, you'll soon know, unofficially, who will be the
next president.
   But either way, if you want to be nail-it-down sure who won, all
you really need is the song _ the official score _ and, please
note, that takes time. They've been singing that song, casting
those votes, counting those votes, for 200 years now.
   Whether it is a long night or a landslide in any election for
the presidency and vice presidency, it's never really over until
it's over in the Electoral College.
   And Congress officially counts the Electoral College's official
votes.
   And you can count on it. It's official, right in your
Constitution.

   It was over early in the Electoral College for George
Washington, no question about it. He was No. 1 among the electors
in his era. They cast 69 votes and he got all of them. For all we
know, they all shook his hand. They even liked him after he took
office, sang that song again and gave him all 132 at stake in the
election for the second term.
   Then again, Washington was perfect in every way. If anybody
deserved a perfect score, it had to be Washington. And you have to
figure even Sam isn't likely to play that song again quite that way
again.
   Then again, some have come close. Ronald Reagan fell only 13
electoral votes short of unanimous when the college met in 1984.
Richard Nixon was just 18 votes away from a unanimous selection in
1972. Franklin Roosevelt got 523 of the 531 at stake in 1936. And
James Monroe would have had a perfect score, but John Quincy Adams
found a friend in William Plumer of New Hampshire and the college
of 1820 marked it Monroe 231 and Adams 1.

   The Constitution demands Americans use the college to elect
their presidents and vice presidents. Many years, by the time
Congress gets around to counting what arrives from the college's
classes in 50 states and the District of Columbia, the announcement
is just for the record.
   But that doesn't stop the officials _ this is, after all, for
all time's sake.
   So, the powers of the legislative branch of government will
gather in 1989 to open the envelopes from the Electoral College,
they'll check to be sure everything is there. Then they'll count,
state by state, Alabama first.
   As they did in 1985, one of the ``tellers'' in Congress will say
the ``certificate of the electoral vote of the State of Alabama
seems to be regular in form and authentic, and it appears therefrom
that'' and then he'll say the name, and how many votes, for
president, then for vice president.

   Using the Electoral College system in the Constitution,
Americans have been electing presidents and vice presidents from
Washington and John Adams, who were No. 1 and No. 2 in the first
term, to Reagan and George Bush, now No. 1 and No. 2 in the 50th
term.
   This year it is Bush for president and Dan Quayle for vice
president on the Republican ticket, and Michael Dukakis for
president and Lloyd Bentsen for vice president on the Democratic
side, and a rich assortment of other Americans wanting to serve in
the 51st term.
   And here's how we the people will decide:
   _Voters vote on Election Day Nov. 8 in 50 states and the
District of Columbia.
   They indirectly elect their next president and vice president.
   Popularly chosen electors, apportioned among the states and
Washington, D.C., are the ones who officially vote for the
candidates.
   Those electoral votes usually go to the statewide winner of the
popular vote.
   _Electors vote Dec. 17 in the states and Washington, D.C.,
sending results to Washington.
   _Congress, in joint session Jan. 6, opens the envelopes, counts
the electoral votes for president and for vice president, and
announces the winners to the world.
   _The newly elected president and vice president take office Jan.
20.

   The Electoral College system was new when George Washington
first heard the official word.
   Here's how that first race turned out:
   Connecticut, casts 7 electoral votes for Washington. Delaware, 3
for Washington. Georgia, 5 for Washington. Maryland, 6 for
Washington. Massachusetts, 10 for Washington. New Hampshire, 5 for
Washington. New Jersey, 6 for Washington. Pennsylvania, 10 for
Washington. South Carolina, 7 for Washington. Virginia, 10 for
Washington. Everybody accounted for? There's a deadlock in New
York, so they won't be here. Rhode Island and North Carolina are
not here, either, but they haven't ratified the Constitution yet.
   Total: 69 electoral votes for Washington. He is unanimously
elected president of the United States.
   As was the rule in the early elections, next in the tally gets
the vice presidency. That was John Adams, at 34 votes. We've got
some also-rans here, but nobody is close to Adams. John Jay's got
9. Robert H. Harrison and John Rutledge are here at a tie with 6
for Bob and 6 for John. Four go for John Hancock. George Clinton
picked up three. A couple here and there for some others.
   But, all agree, Washington was one of a kind.

   As the years went on, the operation of the college was put to
the test, people argued over whether a direct election would be
better than this indirect system. Defenders said this thing works,
leave it alone; opponents said it needed fixing and fast.
   Controversy centered on how the electoral vote math and the
total popular vote math sometimes didn't match, with a close
election in the popular vote turning into a landslide in the
Electoral College because, big state or small state, the general
rule is that the winner takes all of that state.
   States with more people get more electoral votes. But each
state, no matter how many people live there, casts at least three
electoral votes. Wyoming is as strong in the college as the
District of Columbia. Alaska gets what Vermont gets.
   And the mixture changes every decade, in big ways and small,
based on the census. This is a nation with wheels and wings, a
people wanting more sun, perhaps, or another job, perhaps, or just
another place down that road.
   The government is required to count where you are every 10
years, and it hands out House seats based on those census figures.
But the Senate seats are fixed _ two to a state, be it big state or
small.
   All of that is put into the electoral vote system.
   So, as it stands now, California is the current heavyweight,
with 47 electoral votes _ because it has two senators, just like
the other 49 states, but it also has 45 members of the House, and
no state can match that.

   Early on, they changed one of the voting rules when trouble
developed. It came in the balloting for a president and vice
president for the fourth term, 1801-05.
   Again, as they had done in 1789, 1792 and 1796, electors voted
for two candidates. The one with the most votes became president,
next in line got the next job down.
   This time, it's a tie for the top job: 73 votes for Thomas
Jefferson, 73 votes for Aaron Burr.
   The House had to settle it. In the end, Jefferson won. For the
future, to keep this sort of thing from happening again, the
Constitution is amended. Separate balloting for president and vice
president from now on.

<TEXT>
   
   Down through time, while others argued that it works or it
doesn't work or it just might not work when we need it the most,
the electors, on schedule, did their number, did it and didn't do
it again for another four years.
   Some of them did it their own way _ they are, after all, free
agents _ but most remained with the program as written. The
colleges of Washington's day and of Jefferson's day, too, passed
away, one by one, replaced by others, one by one.
   And, through the years, the official singers continued their
song, officially revealing results, even when the word already was
out.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   Abraham Lincoln's name was heard just before war, and again just
before the end of war. Then is never heard again. Sadness in that
silence. Franklin Roosevelt's name was heard four times, once when
he left Alfred M. Landon with only Vermont to go with Maine. Then
Harry Truman's name is heard when he surprised those who were
certain it would never be. Twice came Dwight Eisenhower, Richard
Nixon, Ronald Reagan, just as twice had come Ulysses S. Grant,
William McKinley, Woodrow Wilson.
   The Virginians with the famous names _ Washington, Jefferson,
James Madison, James Monroe _ dominated the early going when this
compromise creation was being brought up and running, but then came
Tennessee's Andrew Jackson, and then Illinois gave both Lincoln and
Lincoln's general, Grant.
   Ohio's field included Rutherford B. Hayes who survived one of
the biggest disputes of all by topping New York's Samuel J. Tilden,
185-184. New York's luck was mixed, with Grover Cleveland swinging
in and out and in again, followed by Franklin Roosevelt's four big
showings in a row.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   In 1985, just before Congress opened, counted and announced the
results of Reagan's re-election landslide, old news at that point,
Rep. Jim Wright, D-Texas, who became the House speaker, called the
Electoral College ``a relic of the powdered wig and snuff box era.
It's a charming exercise ... (but) I think it's outlived its
usefulness.''
   But, like it or not, until America settles on something else,
the Electoral College is official voter. And it is the official
vote that counts.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   And, how does this official election music sound as the
officials play it for the ages?
   When last we heard Reagan's name, for example, the action was
Jan. 7, 1985. As the Congressional Record so officially records it,
even as it capitalizes it, for all time:
   
   ``At 12 o'clock and 55 minutes p.m., the Doorkeeper, the
Honorable James T. Molloy, announced the Vice President and the
Senate of the United States.
   ``The Senate entered the Hall of the House of Representatives,
headed by the Vice President and the Secretary of the Senate, the
Members and officers of the House rising to receive them.
   ``The Vice President took his seat as the Presiding Officer of
the joint onvention of the two Houses, the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.
WRIGHT) of the House occupying the chair on his left.
   ``The joint session was called to order by the Vice President.''

<TEXT>
   
   Many of the words that follow in quotes sound strange indeed.
But these words flow from tradition and the law, like the sound of
people singing just as their parents sang, sounding the same
through time, singing the joys of their freedom for all the world
to hear, exercising their vote and the power and the responsibility
it brings. The names, the numbers, they change in time. You're
hearing it now, but you could be hearing it then when the names
Lincoln, Wilson, Roosevelt, Eisenhower would ring where Reagan
rings now.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   To continue:
   ``The VICE PRESIDENT. Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress, the
Senate and the House of Representatives, pursuant to the
requirements of the Constitution and the laws of the United States,
have met in joint session for the purpose of opening the
certificates and ascertaining and counting the votes of the
electors of the several States for President and Vice President.
   ``Under the precedents, unless a motion shall be made in any
case, the reading of the formal portions of the certificates will
be dispensed with after ascertainment has been made that the
certificates are authentic and correct in form, the tellers will
count and make a list of the votes cast by the electors of the
several States.''
   
   So it began, the counting went forward.
   
   ``Mr. ANNUNZIO (one of the tellers): Mr. President, the
certificate of the electoral vote of the State of Alabama seems to
be regular in form and authentic, and it appears therefrom that
Ronald Reagan of the State of California received nine votes for
President, and George Bush of the State of Texas received nine
votes for vice president.''
   
   As the counting continued, it was noted:
   
   ``The tellers then proceeded to read, count, and announce, as
was done in the case of the State of Alabama, the electoral votes
of the several States in alphabetical order.''
   
   Next order of business:
   
   ``The VICE PRESIDENT. Gentlemen and gentlewomen of the Congress,
the certificates of all of the States have now been opened and read
and the tellers will make the final ascertainment of the results
and deliver the same to the President of the Senate.''
   
   That was done.
   
   At last, the final words:
   
   ``The VICE PRESIDENT. The state of the vote for President of the
United States, as delivered to the President of the Senate, is as
follows:
   ``The whole number of the electors appointed to vote for
President of the United States is 538, of which a majority is 270.
   ``Ronald Reagan, of the State of California, has received for
President of the United States 525 votes.
   ``Walter Mondale, of the State of Minnesota, has received 13
votes.
   ``The state of the vote for Vice President of the United States,
as delivered to the President of the Senate, is as follows:
   ``The whole number of the electors appointed to vote for Vice
President of the United States is 538, of which a majority is 270.
   ``George Bush, of the State of Texas, has received for vice
president of the United States 525 votes.
   ``Geraldine A. Ferraro, of the State of New York, has received
13 votes.
   ``This announcement of the state of the vote by the President of
the Senate shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons
elected President and Vice President of the United States, each for
the term beginning on the 20th day of January 1985, and shall be
entered, together with a list of the votes, on the Journals of the
Senate and the House of Representatives.
   ``The purposes for which the joint session of the two Houses of
Congress has been called, pursuant to Senate Concurrent Resolution
1, 99th Congress, having been accomplished, the Chair declares the
joint session dissolved.''
   
   The final words thus spoken, the record notes for history the
time they are spoken.
   
   ``(Thereupon, at 1 o'clock and 22 minutes p.m., the joint
session of the two Houses of Congress was dissolved.)''
   
   Until we meet again.

   With two Lone Stars on the national tickets this year, no one
knows whether Texas will be carried by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen and his
Democratic partner Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts or by Vice
President George Bush and his GOP sidekick Dan Quayle of Indiana.
   And, just as certainly, Texans had no idea back in U.S. Grant's
day that the winning U.S. senator from Massachusetts they voted
against in the vice presidential race would someday turn out to be
Texan Bentsen's great-great-uncle.
   Indiana, certainly, has no complaint about the Texas treatment.
Texas did vote back then for a Hoosier for president. He didn't get
that top job that time but he later won the next job down.
   You remember Henry Wilson and Thomas A. Hendricks, vice
presidents of the United States.
   It turns out Wilson also was vice presidential nominee Bentsen's
distant relative from Massachusetts, now the home of Dukakis,
presidential half of the Democratic ticket this year.
   Hendricks, from Indiana, eventually became quite a name in the
households of his day.
   Texans went for B. Gratz Brown of Missouri over Wilson in 1872.
But they were outnumbered, so Wilson won the vice presidency and
Brown got honorable mention.
   Horace Greeley of New York was Republican Grant's real rival in
the election that year. Greeley and Brown were the ticket for some
Republicans unhappy with the way Grant was minding the store, and
also for the Democrats. However, after the election, Greeley died,
and his presidential electoral votes were cast for assorted other
candidates.
   Brown turned out to get electoral votes for both for president
(18) and for vice president (47). Hendricks collected 42 for
president.
   Grant won the presidential election with 286 votes, and Wilson
got the same for vice president. Indiana contributed 15 of those
votes to the winning ticket. Texas cast 8 votes for Hendricks for
president and 8 for Brown for vice president.
   Hendricks finished second to Grant that year but came back in
1884 to win the vice presidency under Grover Cleveland.

   Through 200 years of America's election experience, the
candidates appear once or arrive again, asking to enter the line of
leaders. The presidents emerge, from A. Lincoln to Z. Taylor, and
the vice presidents, too. In time, some are remembered only in
archives; others survive across the ages and are still on the money.
   From the ranks of the people, the people elect their presidents
and vice presidents on schedule every four years, giving the
winners the executive keys to keep until the next winners arrive.

   Presidential candidate Lenora B. Fulani will be atop America's
ballots on Election Day along with Republican George Bush and
Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Many voters will have various other options.
   According to a ballot-access count Sept. 26 by the Federal
Election Commission and latest tallies by the ballot-watching News
Election Service, at least 17 independent or other-party
presidential candidates are to be on ballots in one or more states.
   Fulani of New York will join Bush of Texas and Dukakis of
Massachusetts on the Nov. 8 ballots around the nation, while Ronald
E. Paul of Texas will be on most ballots.
   Elsewhere, depending on the state, voters will find Lyndon H.
LaRouche Jr., Willa Kenoyer and Eugene J. McCarthy among others
running as either independents or other-party candidates for the
presidency.
   Fulani, a psychologist who worked to become the first black
female presidential candidate to show on ballots throughout the
nation, is running as the candidate of the New Alliance Party which
bills itself as ``the party of the rainbow.''
   In some states, she will be listed as an independent or the
candidate of the Illinois Solidarity, Alliance or United Citizens
parties.
   She says she hopes to draw enough votes from Dukakis to make the
Democratic Party take notice, adding: ``What I am schooling people
to do is to use our votes in a way that puts pressure on the
party'' which ``needs us to get elected. I want us to have power.''
   Fulani failed in her attempt to unseat New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
in 1986.
   Paul, a native of Pittsburgh, Pa., and a fiscal conservative who
was elected four times as a Republican to the U.S. House
representing a congressional district in Texas, is the Libertarian
Party's presidential nominee this time. He is listed as an
independent in some states.
   In 1984, Libertarian David Bergland finished in third place in
the presidential race, drawing 227,204 votes nationally when
Republican Ronald Reagan defeated Democrat Walter Mondale.
   ``I changed parties last year because I felt the voters deserve
a choice,'' says Paul. ``I left the GOP because it has lost all
credibility on balancing the budget.''
   ``I would abolish the Federal Reserve,'' Paul says, and ``create
a sound money system'' and ``I'd get rid of the income tax. It's
only a new 20th century phenomenon in order to finance the welfare
workers state.
   ``Let's say we did not police the world and we had no welfare.
Would we need an income tax? Isn't it interesting that the income
tax came about the time we changed our foreign policy and got a
central bank and started fighting wars overseas? In Woodrow
Wilson's day.''
   McCarthy, a Watkins, Minn., native who resides in rural
Woodville, Va., served a decade in the U.S. House and a pair of
six-year terms in the U.S. Senate from Minnesota as a Democrat. Now
he is in his fourth presidential campaign.
   He failed to win the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968
and 1972. In 1976, against winning Democrat Jimmy Carter and losing
Republican Gerald R. Ford, McCarthy ran as an independent candidate
for the White House and received 680,390 of the 81,603,346 votes
cast.
   ``There is no real choice between Democrats and Republicans,''
McCarthy said in announcing his 1988 bid. ``If any new direction is
to come, it must come through an independent party, the Consumer
Party, and I have willingly offered myself to lead it.''
   He also will appear on ballots as an independent or a Minnesota
Progressive candidate.
   It was in the 1968 presidential race that McCarthy became a folk
hero among the young when he was the political maverick whose
opposition to the Vietnam War helped mark the beginning of the end
of that conflict.
   ``Sure, I've lost before, but I didn't feel I wasted my time,
and I expect to have a significant impact,'' McCarthy says. ``This
year the one thing we have to do is shake up the two-party system,
and that's what I hope to do.''
   LaRouche, of Virginia, is running this year as an independent or
the candidate of the National Economic Recovery Party or the
Democrats for Economic Recovery Party.
   In unsuccessful bids, LaRouche was the 1976 presidential
candidate of the U.S. Labor Party which he founded in 1973; he
announced as his party's 1980 candidate in January 1979 but that
September he decided to run as a Democratic candidate in 1980; he
again sought the Democratic nomination in 1984 and 1988; and he ran
as an independent in the 1984 election.
   Kenoyer, a free-lance writer from Shelby, Mich., is campaigning
as a Socialist and will appear in some states as the Liberty Union
or independent candidate.
   ``I learned my socialism on my daddy's knee back in the
mid-1930s,'' she says; her father was a labor activist.
   Kenoyer says she would spend her first hour in the White House
dismantling the CIA and ``the second hour, the FBI goes.''

   Congresswoman Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi of California, a San
Francisco Democrat, is right at home in the U.S. House _ it's where
her father had represented a Maryland congressional district many
years ago, before he became Baltimore's mayor.
   She is among 23 women serving in the U.S. House during the 100th
Congress, and all are running for re-election this year to the
101st Congress. The number of females in the 435-seat House matched
a record set in the 99th Congress (1985-87), up from 22 in the 98th
Congress and 21 in the 97th Congress.
   Pelosi was born into a prominent political family March 26,
1940. Her father, Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., was elected to the U.S.
House as a Democrat representing a Maryland district and served
from Jan. 3, 1939, to May 16, 1947, when he resigned to become
mayor of Baltimore; he was elected mayor three times, serving from
1947 to 1959.
   Pelosi was educated at Trinity College in Washington, D.C.,
receiving a bachelor's degree in political science in 1962. She
made her home in San Francisco starting in 1969. She was a
California Democratic leader, playing a major role in helping bring
the 1984 national convention to San Francisco.
   She was elected to the U.S. House at a special election in June
1987 to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Democratic Rep. Sala
G. Burton. Mrs. Burton, who died in February 1987 of complications
from cancer, also had gained the seat at a special election,
succeeding her late husband.
   Three of the nation's 50 governors are women and there are two
females in the 100-member U.S. Senate.
   The women who are governors are:
   _ Arizona's Democrat Rose Perica Mofford, who became chief
executive in April when the state Senate convicted Republican Gov.
Evan Mecham of ``high crimes, misdemeanors and malfeasance in
office'' and thus removed him from office.
   Moving up from secretary of state, she is the first female to be
her state's chief executive and only the ninth woman in American
history to become a governor.
   _ Nebraska's Republican Kay Avonne Orr, who was elected in 1986,
defeating Democrat Helen G. Boosalis, a former mayor of Lincoln. It
was the first time both major political parties in any state had
selected female nominees for governor. Mrs. Orr is the first female
to be elected Nebraska's governor, and the first Republican woman
governor in American history.
   _ Vermont's Democrat Madeleine May Kunin, who won in 1984, was
re-elected in 1986, and is seeking a third term this year. She is
the first woman to be elected Vermont's chief executive.
   In all, throughout American history, eight women have been
elected governor, while one woman (Mrs. Mofford) became chief
executive after the governor was removed from office through
impeachment and conviction, for a total of nine female governors.
   Three is the record for the most women serving as governor at
the same time. The first woman governor in the United States was
Nellie Tayloe Ross of Wyoming, a Democrat who began serving Jan. 5,
1925.
   The women in the Senate are Kansas Republican Nancy Landon
Kassebaum and Maryland Democrat Barbara Anne Mikulski, the latest
in the line of 16 females who have been either elected to the
Senate or temporarily appointed by a governor to fill a vacancy.
   Ms. Mikulski was a congresswoman from Maryland before she was
elected to the Senate in 1986. Kassebaum's father, Alfred M.
Landon, was the GOP's 1936 presidential nominee and served as
governor of Kansas. Kassebaum was elected to the Senate in 1978 and
re-elected in 1984.
   The record for the most women serving in the Senate at the same
time is two. The first woman U.S. senator was an appointed one,
Rebecca Latimer Felton of Georgia, a Democrat, who was in office
very briefly in late 1922. The first woman to win election to the
Senate was Hattie Wyatt Caraway of Arkansas, who was initially
appointed in 1931 to succeed her late husband and then was elected
in January 1932.
   Here, state by state, were the 23 women elected to the House for
the 100th Congress.
   The number after her name is her seniority ranking among other
congresswomen of her party, followed by the year she was first
elected.

<HEAD>Dawkins and Keyes Trying To Follow Brooke's Path To Senate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Black Republicans Maurice A. Dawkins of Arlington, Va. and Alan
L. Keyes of Rockville, Md., taking on prominent Democrats, are
trying to follow Edward William Brooke's path to the United States
Senate.
   Brooke, a Massachusetts Republican, was the first black U.S.
senator since the nation's Reconstruction after the Civil War, and
only the third black in the Senate _ all of them Republicans _ in
American history.
   Elected in 1966, Brooke began serving Jan. 3, 1967, as the first
black in the Senate since 1881.
   This year, Dawkins, a businessman, is running against Democratic
former Gov. Charles S. Robb of Virginia for the Senate seat being
given up by Republican Paul S. Trible, who is retiring, while Keyes
is attempting to unseat Democratic Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes.
   After winning the GOP nomination, Dawkins declared that ``they
said it couldn't be done, but we did it. They say Chuck Robb can't
be beaten, but we're going to beat him.''
   In April, Dawkins, heading the state GOP's minority outreach
program, said black voters could gain greater political power by
increasing their participation in the Republican Party, and he said
the Democrats had taken black support for granted.
   Keyes, a former assistant U.S. secretary of state, was selected
in June by Maryland GOP leaders as their party's Senate candidate
replacing Thomas L. Blair who had been nominated at the March
primary but later dropped out of the competition.
   Keyes pledged to carry a message that ``freedom works.''
   Brooke won re-election in 1972 and lost his 1978 bid for a third
term, leaving office in January 1979.
   Two blacks went to the Senate after the Civil War, having been
elected by the Mississippi Legislature.
   The first black senator _ and first black member of Congress _
was Hiram Rhodes Revels of Mississippi, who served after the state
was readmitted to representation in Congress in 1870. He took his
seat in February 1870 and served for a term expiring March 3, 1871.
   The first black to serve a full six-year term in the Senate was
Blanche Kelso Bruce of Mississippi, who held office from march 4,
1875, to March 3, 1881.

   The first black who was elected and served in the House was Rep.
Joseph Hayne Rainey of South Carolina, a Republican. He was elected
in 1870 to fill a vacancy in the 41st Congress, and he was
re-elected to the 42nd, 43rd, 44th and 45th Congresses, serving in

<HEAD>Shake But Don't Drink the Absolut Vodka Ad</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Absolut Vodka marketers want you to shake up
their new magazine advertisement. But, please, don't try to drink
it.
   Just in time for Christmas, U.S. distributors of the drink from
Sweden have come up a new twist that introduces some motion to
print advertising.
   The ads, designed to simulate a snowstorm, have see-through
plastic pressing a clear liquid tight against a black page that
carries an illustration of an Absolut Vodka bottle draped with a
red scarf.
   When the page is shaken, white flecks of plastic float through
the liquid to make it look like it's snowing around the bottle.
   Carillon Importers Ltd., based in Teaneck, N.J., and the sole
U.S. distributor of Absolut Vodka, spent in excess of $1 million to
produce the ads and buy space to run them in three magazines _ New
York, L.A. Style and the liquor trade publication Market Watch. It
hopes 2 million people will see them.
   The ``Absolut Wonderland'' ads are the latest step in marketers'
efforts to cut through commercial clutter and get people to pay
attention to a message.
   Advertisers selling everything from cookies and perfume to
liqueurs and Rolls-Royce automobiles have used scent strips in
magazine ads. Readers have faced cardboard pop-ups of Stetson hats,
Christmas stockings stuffed with a paper bottle and views of the
San Francisco skyline in their magazines.
   Toyota Motor Sales in USA put a cardboard 3-D viewfinder in a
magazine ad last year so readers could glimpse its new Corolla
model. Sellers of Johnnie Walker Black Label Scotch put a dozen
peel-and-stick labels in a two-page ad last year so readers could
remind others of what they wanted for Christmas.
   Carillon was one of two liquor distributors last year that
placed microchips in the middle of magazine spreads that played
Christmas carols when the page was cracked open.
   ``At Christmastime, magazines are crowded with ads. To catch the
reader's attention, you have to do something a step ahead of the
others,'' said Michel Roux, president and chief executive of
Carillon.
   One complaint about the musical ads last year was that some
people couldn't get the music to stop. Music reportedly played
incessantly in some apartment building lobbies after certain
magazines were stuffed in the mailboxes.
   Carillon and its admakers at TBWA Advertising Inc. say they have
taken every precaution this year to avoid one potential complaint _
soggy magazines.
   ``We can't say it will never break,'' TBWA president Richard
Costello said. ``If somebody sticks it with a knife, they may
puncture it.''
   But he said the ads were rigorously tested for leakage, and
proved tough.
   Costello said there were unique problems in preparing the ads.
The flakes had to be exactly the right size so they wouldn't stick
together. A small amount of antifreeze was added to the liquid so
it wouldn't freeze and crack if the magazines were stored at low
temperatures.
   And, oh yes, the ad itself notes that the liquid is not Absolut
vodka. It is a non-toxic liquid ``not for human consumption,'' the
ad says.
   Edward Kosner, editor and publisher of New York magazine, said
he thinks imaginative advertising approaches are usually good for
the advertiser, the magazine that runs them and the magazine
business in general.
   ``I don't think you could run a novelty unit like this every
week, because people might find it obtrusive,'' he said. ``But
running one occasionally sparks up the magazine and attracts
attention to the advertising.''
   Costello has no complaints. He said Absolut Vodka sales were up
35 percent last year, and are running 33 percent higher so far this
year.

   It was not too long ago that automobile designers
watched their drawings come alive in one car _ and then vanish into
automotive lore.
   But the ``concept'' or ``show'' car that was a designer's pipe
dream yesterday might actually make it to the road someday, auto
executives say.
   ``The idea of show cars is to test the limits,'' said Tom Gale,
Chrysler Motors Corp.'s vice president for product design.
   ``We're living in a world that's four to five years in the
future,'' he said.
   Yet today, ``There are several reasons why the concept cars look
a lot more realistic,'' said Jerry Palmer, director of advanced
design at General Motors Corp. ``A lot of it has to do with
technology.''
   ``The cars in the '50s were really wild-looking things. You
couldn't do those kinds of things in production,'' he said.
``Forget about the fact that they may or not have had fins; they
had glass canopies. At that time the hardware and the technology
wasn't there.
   ``Now, all the technology is available. It's kind of hard to do
a wild show car and shock anyone anymore. Someone is going to ask
`Why can't I have one?'''
   The car buyer can, bit by bit.
   Gone are the bullet-like looks of the '50s and '60s when
designers let their imagination roam unfettered by manufacturing or
engineering restraints. Here are more aerodynamic lines, with
smoother unions between metal and glass.
   ``In the '50s, it was a period of incredible optimism,'' said
Dave Turner, director of advanced concept design at Ford Motor Co.
``I think in the '60s and '70s, society in general began to take a
little more pragmatic approach.''
   Concept cars today, he said, ``are used to condition ourselves
to some ideas and test people's reactions.''
   That's where the auto shows come in. Every year, automakers haul
some of their design cars around the country and the world to show
them off.
   Gale said the Chrysler Portofino concept car, with four doors
that swing open on pivots and close like guillotines, is getting
``show worn.''
   Nowadays, with a little imagination, show goers can nearly see
themselves tooling down the highway in one of the concept cars. But
people's imagination had to be particularly fertile to picture
themselves behind the wheel of a concept car from the '50s or early
'60s, complete with their canopies.
   Despite all the other changes through the years, glass roofs
have endured. Most of the show cars automakers are willing to
exhibit have clear roofs.
   And the problem that faced designers of yesteryear _ incredible
heat buildup in the canopy _ is disappearing with the advent of
films that can darken as sunlight gets brighter. It's the sort of
stuff that's been used in eyeglasses that turn lenses dark outside
and clear inside.
   That glass technology is one example of how designers' hands are
being freed by science.
   And part of that science is creeping into cars on the highways.
Automakers are installing such light-sensitive films in mirrors on
some of their models.
   ``These are vehicles that aren't that far away from reality
because they are designed or engineered around technology available
now,'' Palmer said.
   Along with changes in technology in the cars and the factories,
the car buyer also is influencing the designers.
   ``The customer has gotten very sophisticated,'' Turner said.
``You can't fool him anymore. He demands that real technological
improvement.''
   ``They don't want technology for its own sake, they want
technology they can believe in.''

<HEAD>Mitsubishi Offers $12 Million in San Francisco Graffiti Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mitsubishi has a new idea that gives new
meaning to the phrase ``station break.''
   The Japanese company has offered city officials $12 million to
battle graffiti if the electronics company wins exclusive rights to
install television screens displaying news and commercials in
underground transit stations.
   Mitsubishi has tentatively planned to design and install the
prototype system at its own expense and to maintain them in the
city's stations for the next eight years. A local firm, Visualmedia
Concepts, would sell advertising for the color TV monitors.
   San Francisco's Municipal Railway, which has underground
stations along Market Street, would receive a small portion of the
advertising revenue.
   The televisions could also be used to announce train arrivals
and departures, to display public service messages and give news
reports.
   Jaimie Levin, the railway's director of community relations,
called the proposal ``very speculative.''
   ``We don't know if they can give us what we want,'' she said
Friday. ``We may not be able to go this route with them, but we'd
be fools if we didn't explore it.''
   Televisions that display advertising logos, but not action
videos, already have been placed in subway stations in Chicago.
   The municipal railway's general manager, Bill Stead, recently
proposed an anti-graffiti program that would cost up to $13 million
annualy, but Mayor Art Agnos said a fare increase could not be used
to pay for it.

<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers members at the Chrysler
Corp. minivan assembly plant here were scheduled to return to work
Monday after voting to end a two-week-old strike.
   Union members at Chrysler's plant No. 2 ratified a new local
contract Friday by a 70 percent majority, with 1,677 voting in
favor of the agreement and 707 voting against it.
   Negotiators for the UAW and Chrysler reached the tentative
agreement on Thursday.
   The strike began Oct. 5 when some 3,200 union members walked off
their jobs after negotiators failed to meet a contract deadline. A
tentative agreement was reached two days later, but it was rejected
in two ratification votes.
   Chrysler filed suit last week seeking a temporary injunction to
halt the walkout, but U.S. District Judge Clyde Cahill went no
further than to urge the two parties to settle their differences.
   Karen Stewart, a spokeswoman for Chrysler, said the strike cost
the company an estimated $3 million a day.
   She said Chrysler, as part of the tentative accord reached
Thursday, would drop its suit against the local.

<HEAD>Oil Ministers Agree to Freeze Production at Current Levels</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites throughout with Algerian minister's comments. No
pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC members who ended three days of talks
over the weekend agreed the cartel should maintain its crude oil
output at current levels and not increase it until the group
reaches a new agreement on production, the oil minister of Algeria
said Sunday.
   OPEC leaders said several production plans were under
consideration.
   The Algerian representative, Balkacem Nabi, said some of the
eight ministers at last week's meeting asked several OPEC members
to reduce their output but were refused.
   The ministers then agreed to freeze the cartel's output at its
current levels of around 21 million barrels a day, he said.
   The pricing and long-term strategy committees of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had met in hopes of
making progress toward a new production agreement that might
stabilize prices.
   Rampant overproduction by several OPEC members forced the price
of oil to about $12 a barrel recently. The cartel's output is well
above its agreed-upon overall ceiling of 15.06 million barrels a
day for 12 of the 13 member nations. OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman
said Saturday the ministers decided to propose a 17.5
million-barrel-a-day ceiling on production, up from the current
15.06 million.
   However, Secretary-General Subroto of Indonesia told a later
news conference several production plans were under consideration.
He said no one plan had met the approval of all eight ministers.
   Lukman, who also is Nigeria's oil minister, said the proposed
ceiling of 17.5 million would be for the short term with an
unspecified increase later.
   Nabi said seven of the ministers said they were more concerned
with revenue than production.
   OPEC experts have estimated the demand for the cartel's crude
output in the final quarter of the year to be 18.9 to 19.3 million
barrels a day, which means the current glut of crude on world
markets will continue.
   In a statement released after the talks ended, the cartel said
its price planners would meet again in Vienna, Austria, on Nov. 17
after consultations with their governments.
   A full ministerial conference is set for Nov. 21 in Vienna.
   Lukman told reporters he was happy with the latest meetings. He
said all eight participating ministers had emphasized the need for
Iraq to come back into the quota agreement.
   However, Iran resisted at the meeting any proposal that would
give Iraq production parity with Iran.
   The meeting's chief objective was to secure a new production
control pact to include Iraq for the first time since 1986. Iraq
has refused to abide by any OPEC-mandated production quota if it
does not have parity with Iran.
   Iran has an OPEC quota of 2.4 million barrels a day and Iraq's
official ceiling is 1.5 million barrels a day. The two countries
have been at war since September 1980 but are now recognizing a
cease-fire.
   The countries represented at the meetings, besides Iran and
Iraq, were Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Indonesia, Algeria, Venezuela and
Nigeria.

   George Bush was the overwhelming choice for
president among a survey of presidents of small businesses released
Sunday.
   In the survey, published in the magazine D&B Reports, 63 percent
of the respondents said they planned to vote for the Republican
presidential nominee, while 14 percent said they would vote for
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis. Twenty-three percent said they
were undecided.
   The survey, to be printed in the November-December issue of the

business presidents upbeat about the direction their companies and
the economy will take next year.
   Seventy-one percent of the respondents called themselves
optimistic, while 14 percent said they were pessimistic about
prospects for 1989.
   The survey was mailed to presidents and owners of 5,000
businesses with annual sales under $12 million. Dun & Bradstreet
said the companies were selected randomly from its database of more
than 9 million businesses.
   The response rate was 12 percent, Dun & Bradstreet said.

<HEAD>Assistance Request Leads To New Bidding On Two Texas Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators have reopened bidding for the
purchase of Texas American Bancshares Inc. and National Bancshares
Corp., paving the way for bidders who previously submitted
proposals to step back into the action.
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. officials said Friday Minnesota
businessman Carl Pohlad's request for more federal assistance in
his plan to buy the two banks was too significant to approve
without obtaining competing offers.
   Pohlad, owner of the Minnesota Twins, said in July he would put
up $200 million in capital to go with $475 million in government
aid to buy Fort Worth-based Texas American and San Antonio-based
National Bancshares.
   But after a close review of the companies' books, Pohlad tried
to make changes in the proposed transaction.
   Texas American chairman Joseph Grant told the Dallas Morning
News Pohlad was expected to join in the new round of bidding.
   Other likely contenders are Richard Rainwater of Fort Worth,
former financial adviser to the billionaire Bass brothers, and
Morton Meyerson of Dallas. The two previously submitted a joint
proposal to buy the banking firms.
   Also a likely suitor in the new bidding is Dallas banker Gerald
Ford.
   Rainwater, contacted Sunday by The Associated Press, would not
say whether he would re-enter the bidding for Texas American and
National Bancshares and declined to comment on the transaction.
   Morton and Ford did not return telephone calls Sunday from The
Associated Press.
   Pohlad's Minneapolis firms, MEI Diversified Inc. and Bank Shares
Inc., have been trying to acquire Texas American and National
Bancshares.
   Speculation was the deal soured when disagreement was fueled by
generous terms subsequently granted NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.,
to take over First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas.
   Although the FDIC will finance possible future losses at First
Republic, Pohlad would get no further help if losses exceeded $475
million.
   If Pohlad's transaction goes through, his companies would own
the fourth-largest banking company in Texas. Its $8 billion in
assets would dwarf Bank Shares' present assets of $1.8 billion.

called Big Blue.
   But IBM in September voiced concern over possible trademark
infringement because the company manufactures a typewriter ribbon
called Big Blue.
