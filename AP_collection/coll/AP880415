   Two hostage passengers on a hijacked
Kuwait Airways jet pleaded for their lives via radio Friday and
urged the Kuwaiti government to give in to the demands of the
Shiite Moslem gunmen.
   Algerian mediators shuttled between the booby-trapped jet and
Kuwaiti officials on Friday, the 11th day of the crisis.
   The masked gunmen who commandeered the jumbo jet on a flight
from Bangkok to Kuwait on April 5 want Kuwait to release 17
terrorists convicted of bombing the U.S. and French embassies in
Kuwait in 1982.
   ``In the name of God the merciful, I greet my family and my
friends and I ask the Kuwaiti authorities to free the 17 prisoners
held in Kuwaiti prisons,'' said Soleiman Mohammed Soleiman
al-Mashari, one hostage, in a message to the control tower. ``In
the event of refusal, they are going to kill us.''
   In a second message, a man identifying himself as Mohammed Ahmed
Al-Ajem said: ``I am one of the hostages from the Boeing. I greet
my family, large and small and I ask the Kuwaiti authorities to
free the prisoners in the prisons. Without that, the kidnappers
have decided to kill us.''
   An estimated 31 passengers and four crew members were being held
in grim conditions by eight hijackers, armed with guns and grenades.
   In Washington, a Reagan administration official speaking on
condition of anonymity said a man wanted in the United States in
the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner was believed to be one of the
gunmen on the Kuwaiti plane.
   The official said the man, Hasan Izz-Al-Din, was named in a 1987
federal indictment charging him and three others with conspiracy to
commit air piracy, murder and assault in the hijacking in which 39
Americans were held hostage and a U.S. sailor was killed.
   The Boeing 747, which had 112 passengers aboard when it began
its journey, was diverted to Mashhad in northeastern Iran, then to
Larnaca, Cyprus. Fifty-seven passengers were released in Iran and
another 13 in Cyprus. Two passengers were killed in Cyprus.
   The air pirates have threatened to kill the remaining hostages
and blow up the plane if their demands are not met.
   Algerian officials expressed disappointment Friday that
negotiations at the airport had not achieved better results.
Negotiations began Wednesday, shortly after the plane arrived from
Larnaca, Cyprus.
   Western sources in Paris said it was believed that parallel,
high-level negotiations were also taking place between Kuwait and
Iran with Algeria acting as an intermediary.
   A report by the official Kuwait news agency Friday said the
hijackers appeared to be divided over the negotiations, and it
seemed that Iran was directing the hard-line faction.
   Some of the hijackers believed to have boarded in Mashhad had in
recent hours become ``more extremist and obstinate,'' said the
agency KUNA, without citing any sources.
   State-owned Kuwait radio reported that Kuwaiti Prime Minister
Sheik Sad Al-Abdallah Al-Salim Al-Sabah on Friday telephoned
Algerian Premier Abdelhamid Brahimi to discuss ``the
intensification of efforts being exerted to bring about the release
of the passengers.''
   The radio report, monitored in London, gave no details.
   On Thursday, the hijackers released Djuma Abdallah Chatti, 70, a
diabetic who was in urgent need of an insulin injection.
   Before his release, he had been examined on board the plane by
an Algerian doctor who told the hijackers Chatti was in danger of
dying if he did not receive treatment.
   After Chatti was freed, the gunmen issued a statement saying,
``We are not highway bandits.''
   However, the hijackers repeated their demand and said they would
carry out executions ``even if the price we have to pay is very
high.''
   A Kuwaiti official, who insisted on anonymity, said Chatti
reported that all of the hostages had their wrists handcuffed
behind their backs. They were not allowed to speak or move from
their seats in the mid-section of the plane except to be escorted
to the toilets by one of the gunmen, who kept a pistol pointed at
the hostage's back.
   Chatti said the hostages were completely ignorant of the
negotiations.
   He said there were eight hijackers and that passengers were
grouped in seat rows 22 to 36, located directly above the fuel
tanks.
   A Kuwaiti official who demanded anonymity said Chatti told the
Kuwaiti delegation that four bombs were attached to the four doors
in the midsection of the plane.
   Among the hostages are three members of Kuwait's royal family
and at least four crew members.
   Algerian officials on Thursday privately expressed optimism that
their separate negotiations with the Shiite Moslem hijackers and a
Kuwaiti delegation would lead to the release of the last two women
on board, cousins of the emir of Kuwait.
   There was widespread disappointment when only Chatti was freed.
   Chatti said the hostage treated most roughly was the Fadel
Khaled Al-Sabah, 33, cousin of the emir of Kuwait, regarded as the
hijackers' trump card.
   Al-Sabah suffered from a severe nervous disorder even before he
boarded the plane in Bangkok, and the experience of the hijack
``seems to have put him over the brink,'' Chatti said.
   Chatti said Al-Sabah had continuous violent shakes, was unable
to speak and cries continuously. The hijackers brought a microphone
to him and tried to force him to make a statement, but he was
unable to do so.

<TEXT>
   The alleged mastermind behind the
hijacking of Kuwait Airways Flight 422 is a longtime fugitive from
justice linked to two earlier hijacks.
   Imad Mughniyeh, 36, is one of four suspects wanted by the U.S.
Justice Department in the hijacking of a TWA airliner on June 14,
1985, by Shiite Moslem extremists. A U.S. Navy diver was killed and
39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days before being freed after
Syrian intervention.
   In Washington, a Reagan administration official said another man
wanted in the United States in the TWA hijacking was believed to be
a hijacker on the Kuwaiti plane.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the man,
Hasan Izz-Al-Din, was named in a 1987 federal indictment charging
him and three others with conspiracy to commit air piracy, murder
and assault in the hijacking.
   Western intelligence agencies also believe Mughniyeh was
involved in the December 1984 hijacking of a Kuwaiti airliner to
Tehran that left two Americans dead.
   Iranian security forces stormed the plane after five days. The
hijackers disappeared and Tehran has issued no word about them.
   Western sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Mughniyeh is the leader of a clan, one of several in the Bekaa
Valley of eastern Lebanon that control the drug trade in there.
   He also is chief of security for the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, in Lebanon. Hezbollah is considered by Western and
Lebanese intelligence agencies to be the umbrella organization for
groups holding foreigners hostages in Lebanon.
   Mughniyeh's cousin and brother-in-law is one of the three
Shiites among the 17 imprisoned in Kuwait who have been sentenced
to death.
   Western observers have said it is this family connection that
has fueled Mughniyeh's mission to free the 17 terrorists.
   The Kuwaitis have identified the condemned man as Elias Saab,
but his real name is Hussein Ali Badreddin. He entered Kuwait on a
forged Iraqi passport, Western intelligence authorities said.
   Ever since Badreddin was arrested in Kuwait, Mughniyeh has tried
to free him.
   Mughniyeh dropped out of sight in Beirut several weeks ago,
according to well-informed sources who asked not to be identified.
   One of Hezbollah's factions is the Islamic Jihad, or Islamic
Holy War, the Shiite group holding foreigners hostage in Lebanon.
It has said it would free the Americans they hold if Kuwait frees
the 17 terrorists.
   Kuwait has refused and the hijacking of the Kuwaiti airliner,
which was taken first to Iran, then to Cyprus and finally to
Algeria, has not changed that stance.
   At one point during talks in Cyprus, Palestinian negotiators
said the hijackers offered to release half their hostages if Kuwait
freed the three among the 17 who had been sentenced to death.
Mughniyeh's cousin is among the three.
   The Cypriots, acting on Kuwaiti advice, rejected the offer. But
it underlined Mughniyeh's suspected role in the hijacking.
   Western intelligence sources believe that Mughniyeh joined the
hijacked Kuwaiti airliner in Mashhad, northeastern Iran, when it
landed there after it was seized during a flight from Bangkok to
Kuwait.

<HEAD>Panama Protests U.S. Blocking Of Highway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 4th graf that Nevglovski has been a Marine for 24
years, stead 24 years old.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry sent a formal
protest to the United Nations on Friday alleging U.S. violations of
Panama's sovereignty during a firefight involving U.S. Marines this
week.
   The protest said U.S. troops closed a Panamanian highway just
outside the capital for three hours Tuesday night after fighting
broke out between ``soldiers of the United States and an unknown
group.''
   At a news conference called by the U.S. military, Marine 1st
Sgt. Alexander J. Nevglovski Sr. said Friday that his company
became engaged in a gunfight Tuesday night at a fuel depot with
uniformed men ``who were using us as training aids.''
   ``They were highly professional,'' Nevglovski, who has served
for 24 years in the Marine Corps, told the news conference at the
U.S. Southern Command's headquarters. ``They were good. They were
trying to provoke us.''
   Nevglovski, of Camp Lejeune, N.C., said the intruders wore black
uniforms and carried sophisticated night- vision equipment, but
declined to speculate on whether they were members of the
Panamanian Defense Forces.
   In the protest sent to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, Foreign Minister Jorge Abadia called the highway closing a
``flagrant violation of Panama's sovereignty'' by U.S. troops.
   According to earlier reports, the highway was closed after about
100 Marines exchanged fire with what they described as 40 to 50
uniformed intruders at the fuel dump near Howard Air Force Base, a
few miles west of Panama City.
   The U.S. Southern Command said it consulted with the Defense
Forces before closing the highway for ``security reasons.''
   Col. Ron Sconyers, the Southern Command's chief spokesman, said
Nevglovski was presented at the news conference Friday to answer
reporters' questions because of skeptical reports in the United
States and ridicule in the Panamanian press, which is largely
controlled by the government.
   Nevglovski told of two separate firefights Tuesday night, and
said that during one eight Marines and a sailor were surrounded by
a group of intruders about half a mile from the sergeant's position.
   No casualties were reported Tuesday, but a U.S. Marine was shot
and fatally wounded by fellow Marines in an incident Monday.
Nevglovski said the fatal shooting occurred as the Marines tried to
encircle eight intruders wearing black uniforms and moving in
military fashion.
   The Defense Forces are commanded by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
who is under federal indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges. The United States has imposed economic
sanctions against Panama in an effort to force Noriega, who
dominates the civilian government, to resign.
   Sconyers said a full investigation into the actions Monday and
Tuesday was under way.
   The United States maintains about 10,000 military personnel in
Panama as a permanent force to defend the Panama Canal. About 1,300
additional U.S. soldiers and Marines were sent to Panama last week
to increase security.
   The Panamanian government has described the U.S. Marines as
inexperienced troops who were ``shooting at swaying palm trees.''
   Nevglovski's account of Tuesday's incidents left unanswered the
questions of who were the intruders and why in more than two hours
of sporadic gunfire were there apparently no injuries on either
side.
   He was asked to assess the intruders' motives and the sergeant
replied:
   ``They were basically using us as training aides, to see how
they can get around and how they can't get around, to see how they
can get detected and how they can't get detected.''
   Nevglovski raised a new question when he said Marines did not
chase the intruders into the surrounding jungle because a month or
so earlier ``two Air Force MPs chased an intruder into the jungle
and one was hacked to death with a machete and the other was cut up
pretty bad.''
   No such incident had been announced and after the news
conference military spokesmen said Nevglovski had repeated a rumor
that had no basis in fact.
   And while Nevglovski said he had a group of about 42 intruders
almost constantly in view with a night-vision device, ``I didn't
see a weapon on them. I can't say why. We could see them clearly.''
   He said of the shooting: ``We received the first three rounds
and our (return fire) lasted about 15 minutes. What I could
identify was three or four (muzzle) flashes coming from a certain
area.''
   ``At that time I immediately went to my machine gunner and
tapped him on the shoulder and told him to return fire,''
Nevglovski said. ``He returned fire, approximately 10 or 15 rounds,
and I tapped him again and told him to cease fire.''
   Nevglovski said another Marine opened fire at the same time with
a second machine gun, but ``none of the Marines used their weapons
or pistols because the word hadn't been given to open fire.''
   Nevglovski said that while he and about 90 other Marines were
engaged with more than 40 intruders, another group of nine American
servicemen were surrounded by ``about 10 other intruders'' on a
hill half a mile away.
   The two groups were in radio contact, Nevglovski said, and at
least three 80mm mortar rounds were fired at the intruders'
positions.

   A boy and his three teen-age sisters
were found mutilated in their home and stabbed so hard with steak
knives that the blades broke, and a former boyfriend of one victim
was arrested, police said.
   Leo Narvaiz, 20, was taken into custody after being treated at a
hospital for a stab wound to his thigh and a cut on the hand. He
was charged with four counts of capital murder, said Robert Grego,
court officer for Magistrate Quon Lew.
   Narvaiz was taken back to Medical Center Hospital after a
late-night hearing and will be transferred to Bexar County Jail on
$4.05 million bail, Grego said.
   Narvaiz had broken up with 17-year-old Shannon Mann in the past
three weeks and had been named in two complaints filed by the
teen-ager's father, one alleging a terroristic threat, said
homicide Lt. Albert Ortiz.
   ``He had been trying to get back with her and since he was
unable to, we figure this is what prompted him to break into the
house and commit these murders,'' Ortiz said.
   Miss Mann was found slain along with her sisters, Jenniffer, 19,
and Martha, 14, and brother Ernest, 13, in their mobile home early
Friday.
   ``We figure he either surprised them in their sleep or there's a
possibility that more than one person was involved, which would
have kept them from running out or anything like that. We can't
tell for sure,'' said Ortiz.
   Ortiz said a girl called the 911 emergency number about 3:27
a.m. and said ``one of my sister's boyfriends is beating us up and
has killed my sister.''
   Police were able to trace the call and found the bodies at 3:55
a.m., Ortiz said.
   Police said at least five steak knives were used in the slayings
and that more could have been carried off from the five-bedroom
mobile home.
   ``It's unbelievable. All of them were savagely stabbed. There
are knives broken off in their necks,'' said Sgt. George Wilson, a
28-year member of the department. ``It's a slaughterhouse.''
   Mary Mireles, who lives across from the trailer park, said there
have been numerous robberies there and that she heard a commotion
early Friday, and thought she heard gunshots.
   ``I heard a lot of screams,'' Mrs. Mireles said. ``They were
screaming, `Help' and they were crying and screaming and I told my
husband and he said, `No, let's not get involved.'''
   ``He thought they would shoot at anybody who went out to see
what was going on,'' she said.
   The 10-acre park in a quiet neighborhood has a full-patrol
security system, plus a swimming pool and well-equipped recreation
center, said Barry Byers, a supervisor for Mobile Home Park. He
described residents as middle-class. ``These people have been
screened,'' he said.
   The victims' parents, Ernest and Becky Mann, are separated. Mrs.
Mann was living with the children but was not home at the time of
the attack, police said.
   Police Lt. Weldon Stinson said officers were unable to determine
if the girls had been sexually assaulted.
   The bodies were so mutilated that police first reported that
four girls had been killed. But Mrs. Mann later confirmed that one
was a boy. She collapsed after identifying them, police said.
   At one point, the victims' father struck a television cameraman
and four officers restrained him from striking a second one.
   ``Get those cameras out of here. This is not a carnival!'' Mann
said.
   Janice Pope, a friend of the girls, said the family moved in
about a month ago and were known for throwing parties for
neighborhood friends.
   ``They loved to have fun. They just wanted some attention,'' Ms.
Pope said. ``They just wanted friends.''
   Yvonne Ochoa, 20, said she had worked with Shannon Mann at a
grocery store until Miss Mann resigned about four months ago.
   ``She wouldn't talk, but she asked me about married life and
said she was wanting to move in with her boyfriend,'' Ms. Ochoa
said. ``They were always breaking up but she said she loved him.
   ``She said that he hit her and that he also broke into her other
house but that she still wanted to marry him.''
   Darrell Flynt, principal of McCollum High School, said Shannon
withdrew from school last November as a sophomore, and Jennifer
dropped out of school in 1985 as a junior.

   The dollar plunged on world currency markets
Thursday in reaction to bad news on the U.S. trade deficit despite
a massive coordinated effort on the part of the United States and
its economic allies to halt the slide.
   The dollar's steep dive served served as an ominous reminder to
the world's economic powers that their best-laid plans to steady
the global economy can be quickly disrupted by events.
   Just as it had done several times last year, the weakness in the
dollar quickly spread to other financial markets, sending interest
rates up sharply and pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average down
by more than 100 points, its second three-digit loss this year.
   The market turmoil came only a day after the world's seven major
industrial countries had issued a glowing communique bragging about
their ability to hold the dollar stable for the past four months.
   Finance ministers and central bank presidents of the seven
nations _ the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britian, France
and Italy _ reaffirmed on Wednesday their commitment to keep the
dollar stable.
   They pledged to back up the commitment with coordinated
intervention, the process by which governments dump other
currencies in exchange for dollars as a way of supporting the
greenback.
   Participants in the day-long Wednesday meeting said they had not
been told in advance by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III that
the February trade deficit would be an unexpectedly large $13.8
billion, triggering the need for intervention. Baker is briefed a
day in advance on government economic reports.
   The finance ministers professed satisfaction with the way their
cooridnation effort had worked Thursday, but the dollar still
closed sharply lower against other currencies.
   In Europe, the dollar fell to 123.60 yen, breaking through a
125-yen barrier which has been considered the lower level for the
greenback over the past four months.
   In Tokyo on Friday, the dollar opened a sharp 1.7 percent lower
against the yen but stabilized later at that level on reports of
heavy dollar-buying by the Bank of Japan.
   While the global recession which some predicted following last
October's market collapse has not materialized, the turmoil
Thursday served as an chilling reminder of the continued fragility
of world economy.
   Baker and finance ministers from other countries tried to put
the best face on the dollar's tumble Thursday, contending that the
speed with which the countries intervened to support the dollar
showed that the drive for international cooperation was working.
   Currency traders reported that the Federal Reserve in the United
States and the central banks of West Germany, England, Switzerland
and Italy were among those intervening to brake the dollar's fall.
   ``I think what you see today is a very good example of
international cooperation because there has been concerted
intervention in support of the dollar involving a very large number
of countries,'' Nigel Lawson, the British chancellor of the
exchequer, said in a briefing for reporters.
   The surge in the trade deficit and the dollar's tumble were
among the items discussed by the world finance leaders as they
continued their talks Thursday.
   Baker, the prime architect of the three-year effort to manage
the level of the dollar, was grim-faced when he arrived for the
meetings, held at the headquarters of the International Monetary
Fund in Washington.
   He brushed past reporters without answering any questions, but
later his office released a text of comments he made during the
closed-door session in which he played down the significance of
February's widening of the trade deficit and stressed the resolve
of the United States and its allies to keep the value of the dollar
stable.
   ``Monthly trade figures are by their nature erratic. What is
important is that we are continuing along the general path of
reduced imbalances,'' Baker said.
   He said the United States has made progress in reducing its huge
federal budget deficits, something other countries have long urged.
Baker singled out Japan, West Germany and Britain for praise in
efforts to stimulate their domestic economies as a way of keeping
the global economy growing.
   Baker's comments were echoed by other finance ministers, who
also dismissed the February jump in the deficit as an aberration.
   But the swift drop in the dollar's value raised questions of how
successful countries will be over the long term in keeping the
dollar at its present levels. Many economists have forecast that
the dollar will eventually have to decline more to solve America's
trade problems.
   In their Dec. 22 accord, the countries pledged to keep the
dollar stable around current levels. While the governments have
never been specific about just what those levels were, speculation
has put the lower limit for the dollar at 125 yen.
   After it fell below that level Thursday, West German Finance
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, was asked whether the countries would
have to accept a new level for the dollar.
   ``That is a very good question, a thousand-dollar question,'' he
answered.
   The dollar turmoil also raised the possibility that the Federal
Reserve would be forced to tighten interest rates further in this
country to defend the dollar. Higher U.S. interest rates, while
slowing the American economy, are seen as a positive for the
greenback because foreign investors are able to earn more on their
dollar-denominated investments.
   Karl Otto Poehl, head of the West German central bank,
sidestepped questions about whether the Fed should tighten up
during a speech to the National Press Club.
   With Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan looking on, Poehl
said, ``I don't want to comment on American monetary and fiscal
policies.'' He said he believed that his country had done its part
to stimulate world growth by lowering West Germany interest rates.
   ``As far as (our) monetary policy is concerned, we couldn't have
done more. We have the lowest interest rates in the world ... and
it would be irresponsible to pursue more expansionary monetary
policies,'' Poehl said.
   It was a heated dispute between Baker and the West Germans last
year over interest rates which has been cited as one of the
contributing factors to Oct. 19 stock market plunge.
   Since that time, world finance leaders have gone out of their
way to stress harmony and coordinated efforts to keep the global
economy from toppling into another recession.

   Jai alai players went on strike in
Connecticut, Rhode Island and Florida on Thursday to protest what
they say are unfair working conditions and harassment since
organizing a union earlier this year.
   Richard Aries, a lawyer for the 500-member International Jai
Alai Players Association, said the strike affected frontons in
Bridgeport, Hartford and Newport, R.I., and many of the 10 frontons
in Florida.
   Frontons are buildings that house courts where the handball-like
game is played before spectators who bet on the matches.
   People who answered the telephones in Hartford and Bridgeport
said the frontons weren't open because players weren't working.
There was no answer at the Rhode Island facility.
   In Florida, two frontons in Melbourne and West Palm Beach
canceled performances Thursday. Frontons in Miami and Quincy, Fla.,
remained open using non-striking and substitute players.
   Officials at all frontons in Florida except Ocala and Fort
Pierce said they expected to be open Friday. The others are in
Tampa, Fla., and Daytona Beach, Fla.
   Aaron Carbone, a spokesman for the Hartford fronton, said
management signed about six players Thursday night and expected to
have between 15 and 20 players ready for Friday's program.
   There are about 550 jai alai players in the three states, Aries
said. He said about 90 percent of them have joined the association.
   Aries said that members of the association have been forbidden
from wearing the union's insignia and that at least five players
have been told their contracts will be terminated.
   ``The players were unable to tolerate the continuing harassment
and intimidation that has followed their organizing into an
association,'' Aries said. ``They had put up with a lot during the
course of their regular employment ... with contracts that allowed
fronton owners to dominate them.''
   The National Labor Relations Board has conducted hearings in
Hartford, Boston and Miami on the association's request that

   The ``Rat Pack'' tour has become ``The
Ultimate Event,'' as Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. joined
forces with Liza Minnelli for an 18-concert, 12-city U.S. tour.
   Sinatra and Davis had begun a recent singing tour with rat-pack
buddy Dean Martin, but Martin had to drop out after six concerts
when an old kidney problem flared up.
   ``We miss Dean and we love him _ he's like a brother to me and
Sam,'' Sinatra said Thursday. ``Liza is the greatest female
performer of our time. She is a great lady and it is always a
privilege to share a stage with her.''
   The tour, dubbed ``The Ultimate Event,'' will debut at Houston's
Summit Arena on Sept. 17 and end at the Chicago Theater on Oct. 16,
said Susan Reynolds, vice president of entertainment, marketing and
publicity for Burson-Marsteller.
   ``Liza has been a good friend for many years and my admiration
for her is limitless,'' Davis said. ``Let me tell you, this will be
a fall to remember.''

   Being a princess is not all it's
cracked up to be, says Princess Diana, who added that she enjoys an
occasional shopping trip to a supermarket, local workers reported.
   Diana, the wife of Prince Charles, the heir to the British
throne, was in this city 19 miles outside London to open a big new
shopping mall Thursday and told workers she enjoys buying tea-time
treats for her young sons, Harry and William.
   ``We spoke to her about it not being an easy life. She said it
was not all that it's made out to be,'' said pet shop manager Judy
Straton. But, ``She said she'd rather not say anything about that.''
   The royal family is the constant object of attention of
England's racy tabloids. Earlier this year, rumors abounded that
Charles' and Diana's marriage was troubled.

   Former Texas Gov. John B. Connally, who
filed for personal bankruptcy earlier this year, has been hired to
help a designer of all-plastic weapons try to sell sell its
technology to the U.S. military.
   Redeye Arms Inc. has developed a process that could be used for
weapons ranging from hand guns to howitzers, the company's chief
operating officer, John Floren, said Thursday.
   ``Based upon my understanding of this technology, it represents
an opportunity to revolutionize conventional armaments and defense
systems,'' said Connally, a former Navy Secretary, during a meeting
in Houston with company officials. The terms of the contract were
not disclosed.
   Plastic weapons have been criticized as a boon to terrorists but
Floren said the new weapons will be detectable to airport security
systems, and that the main use for the technology was in larger
weapons.
   Connally, a victim of Texas' oil and real estate slump, had his
personal property auctioned off in January after filing for
bankruptcy.

   Jimmy ``The Greek'' Snyder, fired as a
CBS sports commentator earlier this year, says he's been ``hiding''
in a posh hotel since then. To add to his troubles, he's back in
the hospital for chest pains.
   The 70-year-old oddsmaker was in good condition and undergoing
tests and observation, Miami Heart Institute spokeswoman Esther
Saporito said Thursday.
   Snyder, dismissed from ``NFL Today'' in January because of his
controversial remarks about black athletes, said he woke up in his
hotel room here Wednesday with chest pains.
   ``I don't take any chances, the sooner they can do something for
you the better,'' he said from his hospital bed. ``They (doctors)
are just looking to see what they find.''
   Snyder was hospitalized last July at Duke Medical Center in
Durham, N.C., where examinations disclosed that an artery to his
heart was blocked, and again shortly after his firing. Afterward,
Snyder took up residence alone at the posh, oceanfront Alexander
Hotel on Miami Beach.
   ``I've been hiding there for 2{ months and then this had to
happen,'' said Snyder, adding that he didn't feel ``too good right
now.''

   Morton Downey Jr., the ultra-conservative
talk-show host known for his confrontational style with guests, has
been cleared of charges that he assaulted a gay rights activist
during a program.
   Judge Emil DelBaglivo found Downey innocent of assaulting Andrew
Humm, a 34-year-old spokesman for the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay
Rights.
   DelBaglivo watched a videotape of the show and listened to
testimony during a 4{-hour trial Wednesday before issuing his
decision.
   The tape shows Humm raising his right arm during an angry
exchange between the two. Downey abruptly struck Humm's arm away,
and in doing so, grazed Humm's face.
   The 55-year-old Downey flashed his familiar toothy grin to the
crowd after the verdict and said, ``I am very pleased.''

   Alexandra Ripley, a writer of historical novels,
has been selected to write the long-awaited sequel to ``Gone With
the Wind,'' according to Life magazine.
   The magazine's May issue reports that Ripley, 54, was selected
from a dozen finalists two years ago by the William Morris Agency,
which is handling the project for the family of GWTW author
Margaret Mitchell.
   Ripley, the author of ``Charleston,'' ``New Orleans Legacy'' and
two other historical novels, has written an outline and two
chapters of the sequel, which will be shown to publishers on Monday.
   The auction for hardcover rights could fetch as much as $6
million, with most of the profits going to Mitchell's two nephews,
the magazine said.
   Mitchell, who was killed in 1949 by a drunken driver, refused to
write a sequel to her 1936 novel, saying the story of Rhett Butler,
Scarlett O'Hara and the Civil War reached its ``natural and proper
ending.''

<HEAD>Activists Hit Airlines On Blind Seating</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airlines are deliberately discriminating against
blind people by forcing them to switch seats under the guise of
safety while lacking a uniform seating policy, blind activists
contend.
   Their complaint follows the second arrest in as many weeks
involving the seating of blind people on airlines.
   In the latst incident, James Gashel, director of governmental
affairs for the National Federation of the Blind, who is blind, was
taken into custody Thursday at O'Hare International Airport after
he refused to leave his seat in an emergency exit row on a United
Airlines flight bound from Chicago to Denver.
   United attorneys later withdrew the complaint alleging criminal
trespass, pending a review of the case, and Gashel was released,
said Chicago Police Sgt. Robert DeGraff.
   Gashel, 41, who was on his way to a conference in Boise, Idaho,
says United knew he was blind when they assigned him the seat and
ordered him to move to harass him.
   ``I'm not a safety hazard to anybody. So I don't believe that
there's a basis for requiring me to move,'' he said in a telephone
interview from O'Hare late Thursday. ``I didn't like being singled
out that way.''
   ``Mr. Gashel was adamant in his refusal to leave or to change
seats, and United susbequently canceled the flight,'' the sergeant
said.
   The DC-8 with 200 passengers was scheduled to leave at 3 p.m.
CDT. Passengers were put on a later flight which left at 4:26 p.m.,
said United spokesman Joe Hopkins.
   Hopkins said United's policy is not to seat blind people in
emergency exit row seats because ``they're normally not manned by
crew members. If there were a fire in the wing area, (the blind
person) might be unable to assess the situation.
   ``Also, if we had to evacuate the plane ... it could slow the
evacuation,'' Hopkins said, adding that the Federal Aviation
Administration says plane evacuations must take no longer than 90
seconds.
   ``I don't know the mechanics of how he got that seat,'' Hopkins
said. ``Once we realized what had happened, we attempted to
relocate him to conform to our policies. ''
   In a similar incident, a blind attorney from Iowa was arrested
March 31 on a Midway Airlines flight at the Washington-National
Airport after she refused to move from a smoking section seat into
an exit area seat, said Mary Ellen Reihing, a spokeswoman for the
Baltimore-based federation.
   ``It is becoming clear to us that the pattern is deliberate. Our
leaders, some who move with canes ... are being assigned those
seats and being forced to move from them. It is a clear attempt to
be be harassed,'' she said.
   ``Some airlines say we can't sit in exit rows. Some say we have
to sit in exit rows,'' said Steven Benson, president of the
federation's Illinois chapter. ``We regard it as blatantly
discriminatory.''
   Hopkins denied the allegation, saying, ``They're after the
publicity.''
   Gashel, meantime, planned to fly to Denver today on another
airline.
   ``I don't believe in going along with violating a law,'' he
said. ``I wasn't causing a delay. I feel sad that United Airlines
caused a delay for other passengers and me. I feel about as sad
about that as other passengers.
   ``How do I get justice?''

<TEXT>
   About 500 University of Massachusetts
students, some carrying beer cans and liquor bottles, held a Bring
Your Own Booze rally on campus Thursday night to protest a ban on
alcohol at outdoor events.
   About 200 of the students marched to the home of Chancellor
Joseph Duffey, who imposed the ban last week. No arrests were
reported. The chancellor was out of town.
   Students sang ``Give booze a chance'' to the tune of ``Give
Peace a Chance.''
   ``This could definitely get out of hand but everyone here is a
responsible drinker,'' said student Tim Hopper, 19.
   Deirdre Ling, vice chancellor for university relations and
development, stood outside Duffey's house. ``As long as it's a
peaceful demonstration, students have the right to express their
opinion,'' she said.
   Students began defying the ban en masse Wednesday when nearly
1,000 marched on the administration building.
   ``Students who are of legal age have the right to drink
responsibly at public events,'' said Michael D. Ross, president of
the campus Republican Club, which sponsored the Wednesday rally
with other student organizations.
   He said students were particularly annoyed because Duffey failed
to consult with a student-faculty committee on campus drinking
before issuing the ban.
   The chancellor contended alcohol played a large role in several
racial incidents on campus, including a fracas involving hundreds
of students after the 1986 World Series and an attack on two blacks
by five whites in February.

   A suspected member of Japan's terrorist
Red Army charged with possessing three homemade bombs was turned
over Thursday to federal authorities trying to determine what he
planned to do with the explosives.
   The 35-year-old suspect, who was identified by officials in his
native Japan through fingerprints as Yu Kikumura, is listed by the
Japanese Foreign Ministry as a suspected member of the left-wing
Red Army.
   U.S. officials said they had not yet established ties between
Kikumura and any group.
   ``We have a lot of unanswered questions that we have to
answer,'' said John C. McGinley, agent in charge of the FBI office
in Newark.
   Kikumura was arrested Tuesday at a New Jersey Turnpike service
area in Ridgefield after a state trooper found three bombs in his
car, officials said.
   Superior Court Judge Charles DiGisi released Kikumura to federal
agents without setting bail Thursday. Kikumura was taken to a New
York City jail to be held for a hearing Friday before a U.S.
magistrate in Newark.
   In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court by the FBI,
authorities charged Kikumura with possessing a fraudulent visa and
unregistered firearms. If convicted, he faces up to $260,000 in
fines and up to 15 years in prison.
   State and federal officials heading a terrorist task force said
Thursday they have little information about Kikumura and what he
planned to do with the bombs.
   McGinley said Kikumura had not spoken to federal officials since
being taken into custody.
   According to Japanese authorities, Kikumura was acquitted in a
Japanese court in 1986 of charges of possessing dynamite in his
luggage at an airport in the Netherlands, which deported him.
   The Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that Kikumura's arrest
Tuesday had raised suspicions the Red Army might be planning
attacks during the summit of leaders of advanced industrial nations
June 19 in Toronto, Canada.
   The Red Army, which advocates ``simultaneous world revolution''
and is believed to have members allied with pro-Palestinian groups
in Lebanon, has been linked to a bloody attack on Tel Aviv's Lod
Airport in 1972 that killed 26 people and the hijacking of a Japan
Air Lines plane in 1977.
   The group has been largely inactive in the 1980s, but South
Korean officials have expressed concern it might revive its
terrorist activities at the Olympics in September.
   State police Superintendent Col. Clinton Pagano said the
terrorist task force decided to investigate because of the
sophisticated nature of the bombs.
   ``These are the first devices of this type that we have come
across,'' Pagano said. Neither federal or state officials would
elaborate.
   According to the federal complaint, police said the bombs
consisted of three 18-inch steel cylinders. There was a total of 15
pounds of black powder in the car, officials said.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel Alito said authorities have learned
Kikumura acquired an international driver's license in the name of
Masatoshi Kishizona on Jan. 20.
   Kishizono is a 36-year-old employee of a hospital in Kyoto,
Japan, who had reported his passport missing, police said.
   On Feb. 29, Kikumura, using a fraudulent passport bearing
Kishizona's name, applied for a visa to the United States at the
U.S. Embassy in Paris, Alito said. He said Kikumura entered the
United States on March 8.

   The Senate voted overwhelmingly Thursday to
slap aid and trade sanctions on Mexico for failing to do enough in
the war on drugs, ignoring a plea from President Reagan and
warnings that sanctions would do more harm than good.
   The move, on a 63 to 27 vote, came after backers of the
legislation said it would shock Mexico into doing more to combat
the growing drug flow coming across the United States' southwestern
border.
   Earlier, the lawmakers had voted voted 54 to 40 against taking
the same action against the Bahamas.
   Similar bills were pending in the House, but the measures were
given little chance of being finally enacted into law because of
remaining procedural hurdles in the House and a threat that Reagan
would veto any such measure to reach his desk.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., sponsor of the Mexico resolution,
conceded that point, but said passage in the Senate would ``send a
message to the government of Mexico'' and added, ``We are compelled
to face reality.''
   Opponents of the anti-drug sanctions protested that both Mexico
and the Bahamas, while they can be faulted for shortcomings, are
making good-faith efforts to halt the flow of drugs through their
countries into the United States.
   And Reagan, in a letter to Senate leaders, had argued that
imposition of sanctions against Mexico because would ``adversely
affect every aspect'' of U.S.-Mexican relations.
   The Mexican Foreign Ministry released a statement Thursday night
rejecting the Senate vote as ``foreign interference.''
   ``It is a profound conviction rooted in our history and in our
laws that it only falls to one's own people to define without
foreign interference their institutions and that at all time only
they have the inalienable right to conduct their destiny,'' the
statement said.
   In addition, the statement said, ``No one has the right to
impose from abroad conduct, ideas, political or economic systems on
other peoples.''
   During more than five hours of Senate debate, several lawmakers
suggested that backers of the sanctions were jeopardizing bilateral
relations in response to election-year political pressure.
   ``It's a great opportunity to show them we're tough, show them
who's boss, and that we're against drugs,'' said Sen. John Chafee,
R-R.I. But he noted that the Bahamian government has won praise
from drug authorities for its cooperation. Penalizing the islands
``just doesn't make much sense,'' he said.
   Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., noted that Mexico is the third largest customer for U.S.
exports and that the United States gets 14 percent of its petroleum
imports from its southern neighbor.
   ``This is likely to have a serious negative impact'' on that
relationship, he said.
   Under a 1986 law, countries identified as production or transit
points for illegal drugs must lose half their U.S. foreign aid
unless the president certifies that they are ``fully cooperating''
with the war on drugs.
   Reagan made such a certification on March 1 for 17 of the 24
countries on the drug-trafficking list, including the Bahamas and
Mexico.
   After that certification, several lawmakers in both the House
and Senate began efforts to undo it.
   ``The purpose of this resolution is not to bash Mexico, but to
defend the United States,'' said Wilson, sponsor of the Mexico
resolution along with Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   But one colleague suggested that the United States has little
room to criticize its southern neighbor. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
noted that marijuana is one of California's largest cash crops and
that New York streets are unsafe because of drug-related crime.
   ``I wonder if we shouldn't decertify those states'' and cut off
federal aid, McCain asked.
   While neither the Bahamas nor Mexico receives substantial U.S.
economic aid, losing the administration's drug certification could
lead to loss of other benefits, including lucrative sugar-import
quotas, airline landing rights and trade preferences.
   Of particular concern to Mexico was a requirement that if
certification is lost, U.S. representatives to international
development banks must vote against future loans to the affected
country. The United States has a weighted vote on the banks, but
not a majority. Loans from the banks have been crucial to Mexico,
which is laboring under a mammoth foreign debt.
   Mexico had sent private diplomatic signals that if Congress
persists in publicly embarrassing it through resolutions of
non-cooperation, it is likely to evict U.S. drug agents and wage
the anti-narcotics fight without outside aid, according to
congressional and diplomatic sources.
   In other action, the Senate approved, on a voice vote, a
non-binding resolution to place Haiti on the list of drug producing
and transit countries, subjecting it to greater scrutiny and to
possible similar sanctions next year.
   Reagan, in his letter, said the impact of the legislation
``would almost certainly be an increase in the flow of drugs to the
United States.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had said earlier that the
administration was aware of congressional concerns about the
international drug trafficking problem. But he said that Reagan's
advisers were prepared to recommend that he veto any legislation
imposing sanctions on Mexico.
   He said it was necessary to ``keep in mind the broader national
security interests of our two countries and other interests such as
trade, immigration and so forth.''

   A visit by Vice President George Bush to a

   Jackson's name was mentioned when a reporter shouted out a

   Upon hearing Jackson's name, one child after another began

   ``No, I'm the vice president,'' he said.
   ``Are you George Bush?'' another asked.
   ``Yes, I'm George Bush,'' came the answer.
   He was asked if he saw the president. Yes, just that morning.
   ``Did you see the Easter bunny?'' he was asked.
   Yes, Bush said, at the recent White House Easter egg hunt.
   One child asked Bush if they should be afraid of him.

<HEAD>Texas Talking with OPEC About Possible Cooperation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of Texas is talking with the folks
who brought you the oil embargoes of the 1970s, looking for ways to
cooperate with the OPEC cartel in a bid to revive its struggling
oil industry.
   By itself, Texas is still the seventh largest producer in the
world, but its oil, real estate and banking industries have been
devastated since a 1986 oil price collapse.
   Texans ``cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand and hope
everything is going to be OK,'' says Kent Hance, one of the three
members of the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oil
production in the state.
   Hance met earlier this month with Rilwanu Lukman, the president
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and discussed
the possibility that his state and the cartel would cooperate. More
contacts are planned.
   Hance told Harte-Hanks newspapers on Tuesday that cutting Texas
production to hold up prices ``is one of the things that has to be
considered. It would be one of the items we would discuss'' at
OPEC's April 23 meeting in Vienna.
   ``We can do it to prevent waste,'' he said in an interview
Thursday from Austin.
   From the 1930s to the early 1970s, Texas played the role that
Saudi Arabia can play today _ acting as the world's swing producer,
whose production stabilizes the price of oil. The commission, by
controlling the amount of Texas oil produced, thus had a
significant degree of control over prices.
   That influence dissipated with the rise of the OPEC cartel and
since 1972, the Texas commission has allowed wells in the state to
produce at 100 percent of capacity.
   OPEC demonstrated its clout in 1973, when 11 Arab member
nations, angered over the Arab-Israeli conflict, slapped the United
States with an oil embargo that produced gasoline lines all over
the country.
   Hance said that in the discussions with OPEC, ``we are not
trying to seek an alliance or cartel. We just want input. ... Our
goal is one of stability.''
   But OPEC head Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil minister, told AP-Dow
Jones in Vienna last week after meeting with Hance in London,
``Exchanging information isn't going to do the trick, is it?''
   Last week, Hance said he had discussed a more effective output
monitoring system for OPEC, which has been plagued for several
years by member cheating.
   That point struck John Lamont, oil specialist in the Washington
law firm of Lobel, Novins, Lamont & Flug.
   Noting that the commission for four decades had effective
control over oil prices, Lamont said, ``I don't want Texas going
over there and showing them how it's done.''
   Lamont said cooperation with the cartel by the commission would
be ``probably illegal'' under antitrust laws, but that was disputed
by William Baxter, a former head of the Justice Department's
antitrust division who is now a professor at Stanford University
Law School.
   The economic harm resulting from higher prices and reduced
output ``is precisely the evil that the antitrust laws are aimed
against,'' said Baxter, but he added that it is ``fairly standard
doctrine'' that the laws apply only to private action, not action
by states.
   States also can file antitrust suits, and eight did so recently
against insurance companies. One of the attorneys general involved,
Robert Abrams of New York, was asked about the chances of a suit
against Texas should it cut production in concert with OPEC.
   His spokeswoman, Nancy Connell, replied, ``OPEC price-fixing has
cost U.S. consumers billions, maybe trillions of dollars, and we
wouldn't want to see a state of the United States participating.''
But she said Abrams' office ``would want to know more about Texas
law'' before commenting on any legal challenges.
   Mark Sheehan, spokesman for the Justice Department antitrust
division, declined to comment.
   But a State Department official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said: ``You can imagine what the Reagan administration
thinks about it. It's a cartel that does not operate in U.S.
interests.''
   On the record, Doug Elmets, press aide to Energy Secretary John
Herrington, said, ``It's the department's belief and the
government's policy that assistance to OPEC in its effort to
manipulate the price of oil is not the correct approach.''
   Texas had 201,000 oil wells, a third of the national total, at
the end of 1986 _ down 8,000 wells from the year before. The
state's 2.3 million barrels a day in 1986, the most recent year for
which state-by-state statistics are available, was more than a
quarter of U.S. crude production totaling 8.6 million barrels.
   Current U.S. production is about 8.2 million barrels, and most
analysts believe Texas' production is more than 2 million barrels.
   Several analysts pooh-poohed Texas' chances of achieving
anything by talking with OPEC.
   ``It's a joke,'' said Ed Rothschild, assistant director of the
Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition, a group which advocates
``pro-consumer'' positions. He noted that OPEC has had trouble
controlling prices in recent years.
   ``Since 1981, this organization has been a crumbling,
disorganized, battling group of countries,'' he said. ``When they
agree on action, it never works out. Within a month it's back to
normal _ price discounting.''
   Arnold Safer, president of Energy Futures Group Inc., a
Washington consulting firm, said a plausible Texas production cut
to help OPEC might be 70,000 barrels a day. But he said another
70,000 barrels a day ``would show up pretty quick on world oil
markets, I guarantee it'' _ perhaps even provided by other U.S.
producing states.

<HEAD>Tax Deadline Today but `Tax Freedom' Still 20 Days Away</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first return-filing season under the
broadest U.S. income tax overhaul in history closes out at
midnight. But the average American will have to work 20 more days
to keep federal, state and local tax collectors at bay for another
year.
   ``Tax Freedom Day'' will come May 5, the latest date since the
Tax Foundation began counting a half-century ago. If the government
took every penny you earned until your share of the total tax
burden were paid, the foundation reckons, you would have to work
the first 126 days of 1988 just to meet those obligations.
   Thirty years ago, Tax Freedom Day fell on April 10.
   Several million Americans didn't have time to fret about such
fanciful calculations. They were working up to the eleventh hour on
their 1987 returns, and many were sure to be standing in line in
front of mail drops as the midnight filing deadline approached.
   Any return not postmarked by midnight _ and carrying the correct
postage _ could be subject to a late filing penalty.
   The Internal Revenue Service cautioned taxpayers not to ignore
the deadline, even if they can't afford to pay all the taxes they
owe. Although failure to pay on time can result in one penalty,
failure to file can bring an additional one.
   The IRS estimated that about 6.2 million couples and individuals
would apply for an automatic four-month extension of the filing
deadline by mailing Form 4868 with a check for their estimated
taxes. That is up about 20 percent from last year _ due in large
part to all the tax-law changes that must be reflected on returns
being filed this year.
   Congress' 1986 overhaul of the tax law changed more than 2,700
provisions and led the IRS to create 48 new forms. But the typical
individual was unaffected by the great majority of those changes
and has to use few if any of the new forms.
   Nevertheless, taxpayers have been sufficiently confused about
the new law to telephone more than 17 million questions to the IRS
and to order record numbers of explanatory publications from the
agency.
   The new law reduced tax rates significantly and nearly doubled
the personal exemption to $1,900. But it reduced or eliminated a
number of deductions and exemptions, including those for sales
taxes, medical expenses, moving, consumer interest and Individual
Retirement Accounts.
   One of the biggest sources of confusion was the requirement that
every employee file a revised W-4 form so that the amount of tax
withheld could be adjusted to mirror the new law. Many workers
found the new form so complex that the IRS had to revise it again.
   Eventually the IRS announced it would not penalize any worker
for failing to pay enough tax in advance on 1987 wages.
   The IRS itself is having trouble keeping up with the new law. As
recently as Thursday, it was issuing advice to taxpayers on how
they might avoid penalties that were caused by getting the wrong
answer to a tax question from an IRS telephone ``assistor.'' About
28 of every 100 callers are getting wrong answers, the IRS concedes.
   Economists for the Tax Foundation say benefits of the
across-the-board tax cut enacted in 1981 have been wiped out by tax
increases voted in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1987.
   ``Like the Cheshire Cat in `Alice in Wonderland,' nothing
remains but the smile,'' the foundation said.
   Tax Freedom Day calculations by the Tax Foundation, a Washington
research organization, assume that individuals pay all taxes _
including those collected from corporations. The economists simply
divide all federal, state and local tax collections among taxpayers
and assume that every penny earned each year goes to government
until tax obligations are satisfied.
   Last year, Tax Freedom Day was May 4; this year's May 5 date is
two days later because 1988 is a leap year.
   If taxes were viewed on the basis of an eight-hour work day, the
foundation said, the average taxpayer would have to work 1 hour and
50 minutes a day to pay federal taxes, and another 55 minutes for
state and local taxes. That's two minutes longer for federal taxes
than in 1987 but the same as last year for state and local taxes.

   A federal grand jury is weighing testimony
from a wealthy couple who won a $50 million lease for Justice
Department offices after arranging to pay a $40,000 salary for
Attorney General Edwin Meese's wife, Ursula.
   Independent Counsel James McKay on Thursday personally
supervised the questioning of Howard M. Bender and his wife,
Sondra, before the grand jury, something he does only when major
witnesses are summoned.
   Bender spent about three hours before the grand jury; his wife
was there only an hour. She left at the grand jury's normal
quitting time, indicating she might be called back. The Benders
were accompanied by their attorney, Seymour Glanzer.
   McKay is investigating whether Meese violated federal law
through any conflict between his personal financial dealings and
his government job.
   Although McKay said April 1 he did not have evidence to indict
Meese in cases involving telephone stock and a Mideast oil
pipeline, Thursday's appearance by the Benders underscored the
prosecutor's other announcement at that time: that he still had
some cases to pursue.
   Meanwhile, trustees of the Multiple Sclerosis Society said
Thursday that they never voted on the plan to hire Ursula Meese at
$40,000 a year with money donated by the Bender family foundation.
   The Associated Press reported Wednesday that a partnership
headed by Howard Bender won a $50 million lease on Justice
Department offices after the Bender Foundation put up the money to
pay Mrs. Meese's salary at the MS society.
   Meese, in Atlanta to attend a drug conference, was asked by a
reporter about the matter but declined to comment. During a later
stop at an Immigration and Nationalization Service center in
Decatur, Ga., he turned aside several questions about the lease
arrangement, saying ``that's not on the subject of immigration.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday that he
knew nothing about the lease but that President Reagan ``still has
full confidence in Ed Meese.''
   MS officials have said the Bender Foundation, of which Sondra is
president, donated the money in October 1985 to give Mrs. Meese,
previously a volunteer, the salary for three years. Mrs. Bender and
Mrs. Meese are MS trustees.
   Several MS trustees said they did not learn of that arrangement
until newspaper accounts appeared in the last two weeks. Others,
however, said the board had been advised earlier.
   Susan Sikorski, wife of Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., said she
first learned about Mrs. Meese's salary when her husband read a
newspaper account. Mrs. Sikorski, a trustee, said the issue of Mrs.
Meese's job was never discussed in any board meeting that she
attended.
   Another trustee, Remmel Dudley, gave a different version.
   ``I guess you might say it was reported to the board,'' said
Dudley. ``I cannot say that a proposal was put before the board,
discussed pro and con and then a vote was taken, but we were
informed that this had been proposed.
   ``I was pleased,'' Dudley said. ``I was told the Benders had
this foundation and they could make a contribution to MS or pay for
someone's salary or designate for a specific purpose. We were
delighted to know she (Mrs. Meese) would be a full-time employee
because she's a worker.''
   The board meets quarterly and not all the trustees attend each
meeting.
   Another longtime trustee, who spoke on condition she not be
identified, said, ``I was shocked ... I was aghast when I saw it''
in a newspaper. She said she never missed a board meeting, but had
no idea Mrs. Meese was being paid as MS development director.
   Attorney Bryan Barkley, also a trustee, said, ``I don't recall a
discussion at a board meeting'' about the plan to hire Mrs. Meese.
   He said, ``It is not normal to earmark a grant for the salary of
a specific person. That's a little unusual.'' But he added, ``It's
not necessarily something the board would get into to vote on or
ratify.''
   MS society attorney James Bierbower said the arrangement was
brought up in October 1985 at a special meeting to discuss
expansion of Operation Job Match, a program to help MS victims find
work. Mrs. Bender was at the session, he said.
   McKay has subpoenaed records of Mrs. Meese's job at the society
and is known to be interested in a $50 million lease renewal won by
the Bender partnership in May 1987.
   Most of the offices in the lease were occupied by the Justice
Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service, which had
complained about the building's maintenance, size, location and
security.
   The Bender partnership sold the building 13 days after the lease
renewal, earning a $22.6 million profit on a two-year investment.
The lease was crucial to the sale, the new owner said.
   The Bender partnership had bought the building in March 1985 for
nearly twice its assessed value at a time when the government
wanted to move more than a third of its offices elsewhere.
   Three months after the Bender partnership purchased the
building, the Reagan administration disclosed publicly that it had
decided to retain the building.
   An attorney for the Meeses, James Rocap, denies any wrongdoing
on their part in the transactions, but acknowledges that the
Benders and Meeses know each other. The Benders refuse to discuss
the matter publicly. A key government official said Meese played no
role in the real estate decision.
   Other Bender buildings have done business with the Justice
Department. Government documents show that Howard Bender and his
two brothers, Morton and Stanley, as a partnership, signed a lease
in June 1985 to give the government more space in a downtown office
building, One McPherson Square, where it has leased several floors
since 1971.
   The Justice Department occupies part of one floor there.

<HEAD>Striking Scriptwriters Grant Two Exceptions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking TV and film scriptwriters have
agreed to go back to work under interim contracts at only two of
the several independent producers that asked for relief from the
walkout, the union said Thursday.
   East Coast members of the striking Writers Guild of America met
in New York City on Thursday to consider the request for relief and
take an informal vote; West Coast members met Wednesday. Vote
totals were not released.
   WGA leaders had recommended against separate contracts because
``it could lead to divisiveness and destruction of morale among
members,'' WGA spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said in a statement
announcing the outcome of the vote.
   However, Rhoden said, the WGA membership approved two
exceptions: The ``New Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' and Ivan
Reitman Productions, which has produced such film hits as ``Animal
House'' and ``Ghostbusters.''
   The exceptions were granted because of unspecified legal
considerations and because negotiations with the two producers
``were more advanced,'' Rhoden said.
   It was not known how many scriptwriters would be affected by the
decision to enter into separate contracts with the two production
companies.
   Rhoden could not immediately be reached for comment.
   An unspecified number of independent producers had asked the
union for separate agreements that would allow them to resume work.
   Some 9,000 union writers went on strike March 7 over creative
control and residuals from reruns and foreign distribution. The
walkout shortened the season for many prime-time shows and stalled
the start of some series.
   There have been no formal negotiations since March 10.
   Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for TV and film producers, said the
producers had no comment on the guild's decision not to seek side
deals with independent producers other than the two exceptions.
   He held out little hope for Monday's negotiating session.
``There has been no change in our position,'' Steinberg said.
``Unless this new meeting carries a lantern with it, we see no
light at the end of the tunnel.''
   On Thursday, about 300 union supporters rallied outside the Gulf
& Western building, where Paramount has offices. Among those
appearing were writer and director John Sayles and writers Ernest
Kinoy and Horton Foote.

<TEXT>
   For Democrat Albert Gore Jr., Tuesday's New York
presidential primary culminates six weeks of frustration since his
breakthrough in the South and may mark the end of his bid for the
presidential nomination.
   The Tennessee senator is pinning his hopes on being able to
distinguish himself in the remaining debates before New York voters
and in his late television exposure. But so far, nothing seems to
have worked for him in this critical state, and the air of
desperation is unmistakable as Gore lashes at rival Michael Dukakis
before sometimes unresponsive audiences.
   ``I've listened to Gore; I like him,'' said Ed Silverstein, a
Westchester County Democrat who heard Gore and Dukakis speak at a
Wednesday night dinner in Rye Brook. ``I think he's a brilliant
man, but he doesn't seem real strong, as a candidate.''
   The plight of Gore's situation was clear in polls of New York
voters released Thursday by the Marist Insitute, CBS, and ABC-The
Washington Post.
   All three showed the Tennessee senator still stuck in single
digits far behind Dukakis and Jesse Jackson in the three-man race.
His support remains essentially unchanged after spending half of a
$1 million budget on the New York campaign, aided by prominent New
York television consultant David Garth.
   Gore campaign aides, including manager Fred Martin, contend the
campaign will continue after New York no matter what.
   But one adviser, speaking on condition he not be named, said of
the prospect of Gore staying in the race despite finishing a
distant third here: ``Can he? Sure. Should he? No.''
   Gore managed to raise $330,000 in one evening this week, at a
reception with rich city Democrats at a fashionable Manhattan
hotel. Yet Gore has a debt of $1.6 million so far, and appears to
be putting all he can raise into television ads. He needs a 20
percent primary showing to win a restoration of his eligibility for
most future federal campaign matching money.
   Gore jump-started his campaign and became a serious contender
with his victories in six Southern states on Super Tuesday six
weeks ago. But rather than gaining momentum with his impressive
showing, Gore's candidacy immediately stalled as the campaign moved
into the North. His best showing since then has been 17 percent of
the vote in Wisconsin, and in four other states he failed to do
better than 8 percent.
   Trying to catch up in the few days left to him, Gore launched a
vigorous attack on what his campaign regards as Dukakis' weakest
flank _ his lack of experience in foreign policy. He accused the
Massachusetts governor of a revealing blunder in answering a
newspaper's question on the scenario for use of America's nuclear
arsenal, triggering a tense exchange of charges between the
campaigns.
   Gore's attacks, however, run the risk of reinforcing an
appearance Gore has gained of a desperate, perhaps shrill,
candidate.
   He has faced an array of complicating problems in New York's
complex, ethnic-dominated political scene. He has appealed strongly
for the influential Jewish vote, and pointed to a record of support
for Israel, but faced charges of pandering in the process.
   Gore also has faced a quiet campaign of opposition through the
suggestion that opponents of Jackson shouldn't vote for Gore
because by hurting Dukakis they would enhance Jackson's eventual
outcome.
   ``Our thinking is Gore would be better for Jews in America and
for Israel; the problem is we'd rather have Dukakis than give too
much power to Jackson,'' said a Brooklyn woman who would give only
her first name, Rachel.
   In affluent Rye Brook, Ann McDermit of nearby White Plains said,
``I wouldn't want to help Jackson in any way.''
   Gore addressed that issue head-on before suburban Westchester
Democrats.
   ``Some people have said in this election that one must vote on
the issue of fear _ a vote for Gore is a vote for Jackson,'' Gore
said. ``I ask you to vote on the basis of hope, and leave your
fears behind.''

<HEAD>PCB Contamination of People a Six-Generation Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For children born in the 22nd century, the
adage ``You are what you eat'' may need to be rewritten to read:
``You are what your great-great-great grandmother ate.''
   PCB contamination of people who eat tainted food is a problem
than can span six generations, a researcher told a House Public
Works and Transportation Committee subcommittee on Thursday.
   A 20-year-old woman giving birth to a child passes on sufficient
PCBs so that even if all exposure to the substance were stopped,
``I would still measure PCB in the body fat ... six generations in
the future,'' said Wayland R. Swain, vice president of Eco Logic
Inc. of Ann Arbor, Mich.
   Swain's figures suggest that at 30 years to a generation,
children born in the year 2138 would still suffer contamination
from PCBs ingested in 1988, inherited through the female line.
   PCB production has been banned for years, but the substance,
believed to cause cancer, continues to enter the environment
through such sources as old electric transformers.
   Using earlier research into the transmission of polychlorinated
biphenyls _ PCBs for short _ Swain calculated the amounts of the
substance passed to an infant through nursing and retained in the
infant's body.
   He said an infant nursed by a mother who regularly consumed Lake
Michigan fish, which have been found to contain small amounts of
PCBs, would be exposed to 6.2 milligrams of PCB by the end of 12
months, and 5.3 milligrams would be retained in the infant's body.
   ``It is clear that infants nursed by mothers who have consumed
Lake Michigan fish exceed recommended consumption guidelines (for
adults) for their entire breast-feeding experience,'' he told the
subcommittee on investigations and oversight.
   The level of PCBs retained by such infants, in terms of body
weight, was more than seven times the maximum consumption level
recommended by the Food and Drug Administration, Swain said.
   A mother passes PCBs to a child not only through beast feeding
but through the placenta before birth, Swain said.
   Infants exposed to excessive PCB levels tend to be shorter, have
smaller heads, be more likely to catch infectious diseases, and
exhibit an inability to focus on their surroundings, Swain said.
   A recent decline in PCB levels in the Great Lakes has slowed,
recent research suggests, with the substance circulating from the
sediment into the water and back into the sediment again in a cycle
of continuing contamination of the food chain.

   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more
than 100 points, the dollar sank and interest rates jumped Thursday
after the government announced a $13.8 billion trade deficit in
February, the biggest since last October.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 stocks skidded 101.46 points to
2,005.64, a 4.8 percent decline. It was the year's second worst
drop after a 140.58-point slide Jan. 8.
   The value of U.S. stocks fell $99.7 billion, or 3.7 percent,
according to Wilshire Associates of Santa Monica, Calif.
   The White House and most economists said the trade deficit was
still improving in spite of the setback, but the markets took the
news badly anyway.
   Most traders had convinced themselves the imbalance between
imports and exports would be less than $12 billion, and they bailed
out when the disappointing report hit at 8:30 a.m. EDT.
   ``There was a lot of wishing-makes-it-so (attitude). People
wanted to see a good number,'' said Carl B. Weinberg, chief
economist of High Frequency Economics. He had predicted a $14
billion gap.
   The decline in the Dow triggered a ban on a form of computerized
program trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the first
time the ban has been prompted by a decline of more than 50 points.
Last week, it was triggered by an increase of more than 50 points.
   The Dow had climbed nearly 130 points from April 5 through
Tuesday, largely on anticipation of favorable trade news. The news
killed that rally as declining issues outnumbered advancing ones
nearly 11 to 1 on the NYSE.
   The trade deficit report also battered major foreign markets. In
London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 1.3
percent.
   In Tokyo, stocks fell sharply from their record highs at the
opening of trading today but later recovered much of their losses.
The key Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues, down more than 250
points at one time, finished the morning session at 26,967.83, down
143.52 from Thursday's record close.
   The dollar opened a sharp 1.7 percent lower against the Japanese
yen but later stabilized at that level on reports of heavy
dollar-buying by the Bank of Japan.
   In U.S. activity, the dollar had lost roughly 2 percent of its
value against the yen, British pound and West German mark in spite
of heavy intervention by virtually all the major central banks.
   Big trade deficits tend to push the dollar down by giving
trading partners an oversupply of the U.S. currency.
   Interest rates leaped as pessimism swamped the bond market. The
trade deficit signaled to some investors that an overly strong
domestic economy was sucking in too many imports. Traders also
feared a weak dollar could push up import prices, causing inflation
and hurting fixed-income securities.
   The Treasury Department's benchmark 30-year Treasury bond
recovered about halfway late in the day as stocks were sinking, but
still finished with a decline of roughly $11 for every $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, rose to
roughly 8.87 percent, a three-month high.

   The chairman of the tax-law-writing House Ways
and Means Committee has been hit with more than 2,000 letters from
angry, befuddled taxpayers complaining about the tax changes he
once billed as ``simplification.''
   Even Rep. Dan Rostenkowski acknowledges now that the system
didn't get much simpler _ he blames last-minute tinkering with the
Tax Reform Act of 1986 _ and he says the flood of complaints
doesn't surprise him.
   ``We have been waiting for something like this to happen,''
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said Thursday.
   But he said he had expected even more letters to arrive as
today's filing deadline approached, perhaps closer to the 10,000 he
got after inviting people in a 1985 television address to ``write
Rosty'' if they wanted simpler tax laws.
   ``I must say, it's a dog that didn't bark as far as we're
concerned,'' Rostenkowski said. ``There are very few individuals
who are writing.''
   Committee aides said most of the letters contain copies of an
article in Money magazine's April issue lambasting parts of the Tax
Reform Act of 1986.
   ``Fight back,'' the magazine said. ``Send a message to
Washington by checking off the boxes by the laws that outrage you,
ripping out this article and sending it to the top tax lawmaker:
The Hon. Dan Rostenkowski.''
   The article criticized nine tax provisions, including a limit on
the deductibility of individual retirement accounts, elimination of
a deduction for married working couples and a higher threshold for
claiming medical deductions.
   ``There is a lot of frustration out there, and what we're trying
to do is address it,'' Landon Y. Jones, Money's managing editor,
said of the mail-in campaign.
   ``People are mad,'' he said. ``They're mad about tax reform.
They're mad about how long it took them to fill their forms out.
They're mad about losing their IRA deduction.''
   Pointing to two huge boxes of mail, aides said Rostenkowski has
gotten more than 2,000 letters in a couple weeks _ with no end in
sight _ from angry taxpayers.
   ``In the name of tax reform and simplification, the federal
government has once again botched it,'' wrote a couple from Denver,
Colo.
   ``Would you believe there are parts of this country where you
can't support a family and live in a decent neighborhood on $50,000
per year?'' said a letter from New Jersey. ``There are, and the
situation is worsening.''
   From Kankakee, Ill.: ``Being a middle-class American, I feel
that once again we are the ones supporting our government, paying
for Public Aid persons who could help themselves and carrying the
wealthy people right along. When can we expect a change in the
attitude of the government?''
   The Internal Revenue Service says the changes are not without
benefits, bringing lower maximum rates for most taxpayers and an
increase in the average refund from $806 last year to $825 this
year.

   Always interesting, the Paul Taylor Dance
Company was not trying for ``pretty'' with its premiere of
``Counterswarm'' at the City Center Thursday night.
   Consider Taylor's 1986 ``A Musical Offering,'' danced in caveman
costumes to Bach. Or his 1985 ``Last Look,'' danced by apparently
insane spastics.
   In ``Counterswarm,'' dancers proved they were up to Taylor's
choreographed speed and athleticism.
   Music for the 25-minute ``Counterswarm'' is from the Hungarian
composer Gyorgy Ligeti and contains droning and shimmering tones.
   The two swarms were eight dancers in purple and eight dancers in
red.
   The purple swarm dances first, with elbows bent and close to the
body and hands cupped like cobra heads. They dart their arms out
and back, looking like snakes striking. One couple dances, with
cupped hands together behind their backs. They strut, giving the
appearance of peacocks.
   A couple in red enters and dances briefly, the man seeming to be
subservient, lifting the woman, who maintains a regal posture. The
red swarm dances about, with shoulders shrugging, looking like
chickens.
   Suddenly the red swarm turns futuristic, arms shooting up and
back like antennae on robots.
   The purple swarm enters doing backward sommersaults, then walks
around with knees bent, arms dangling like those of monkeys.
   A woman in red and two men in purple dance, looking like insects.
   After a blackout, a short final section has everybody on stage
for a not very serious war. One person in red and one in purple
rush together and bump stomachs.
   One couple grappled arms in an unfriendly stance as the curtain
fell.
   We don't know what ``Counterswarm'' represented. But it didn't
represent either the lyrical or humorous, more fun side, of Paul
Taylor.
   The company dances at the City Center through May 1.

<HEAD>Bishops Back `Conditional Acceptance' of Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

   A committee of bishops urges the Roman
Catholic church to continue its ``conditional acceptance'' of
nuclear weapons, saying they have been a significant factor in
preventing nuclear war.
   ``In a dangerous world, a world of both widespread nuclear
knowledge and extensive nuclear arsenals, we find condemning
nuclear deterrence too drastic a solution and embracing it too
simple a response,'' the committee said in a report to their fellow
bishops.
   As a result, the committee added, ``the best moral evaluation is
neither to condemn deterrence outright nor to accept it as
self-regulating or normal.''
   The report calls deterrence ``a significant factor in preventing
the use of nuclear weapons'' and said it has ``contributed to a
more cautious posture of the two nuclear powers in world affairs.''
   The church adopted the ``conditional acceptance'' posture in
1983.
   The bishops, in urging its continuation, called the meeting of
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev last December
``the beginning of responsible statesmanship.''
   They said it raised cautious hopes ``that an authentically new
opportunity for redefining the political relationship of the
world's two major military powers may be at hand.''
   The committee said the church's acceptance of nuclear deterrence
should be based on seven points, one of which is ``significant
reductions in strategic armaments, which exceed the requirements of
second-strike deterrence.''
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago headed the committee which
worked for two years to produce the report. The committee will
continue to receive recommendations before issuing a final version
to be submitted to the next general meeting of American bishops, in
Collegeville, Minn., June 24-27.
   ``Our publics share a certain tragic destiny,'' the bishops
said. ``We are both targets; the possibility of a future for our
children is always an open question because the weapons that
threaten both nations are `absolute weapons' ... Publics can hope
but governments must act.''
   Despite the ``uncertain promise'' brought about by a better
relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union,
``there stands the historical fact of major additions to the
strategic arsenals of both superpowers, weapons whose character and
numbers decidedly increase the danger of nuclear war occurring,''
the report said.
   ``This pattern of policy is not adequate to the moral danger of
the age, that these arsenals, by miscalculation or mistake, will
escape human control and destroy in an hour the product of
civilizations which it has taken centuries to build and shape.''
   The bishops said President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative
must be limited to research and development and not advanced to
deployment and that the anti-ballistic missile treaty should not be
cast aside or overridden. They said each step in SDI should first
be evaluated for its consequences in the arms race and that
spending for the program be judged ``in relationship to the basic
human needs of the poor in our country and in other nations.''
   Said the bishops: ``We cannot avoid our responsibility to lift
up the moral dimensions of the choices before our world and
nation.''

<HEAD>Polls Show Dukakis Continues To Lead Among NY Democrats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polls in the last week before the New York
primary show Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis well ahead of Jesse
Jackson in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. mired in single digits.
   Dukakis had the highest measure of support, at 49 percent, in an
ABC News-Washington Post poll released Thursday. The poll also gave
Jackson his highest numbers, at 34 percent.
   Dukakis led Jackson by 45 percent to 28 percent in a CBS News
poll and 46 percent to 34 percent in a Marist College poll, also
released Thursday.
   Gore had only 8 percent support in the first two polls and 7
percent in the third.
   ``Certainly nothing much moved this week except for solidity to
the front-runners,'' said Marist pollster Lee Miringoff.
   A Marist poll last week had Dukakis at 47 percent, Jackson at 31
percent and Gore at 6 percent _ virtually the same results as the
new Marist survey, conducted by telephone Monday and Tuesday among
359 likely Democratic voters.
   Dukakis' strong support went from 53 percent to 67 percent.
Jackson's became nearly unshakeable, moving from 67 percent to 82
percent strong.
   Gore's strength remained at about 40 percent despite the
Tennessee senator's aggressive campaign style and a television
advertising budget that aides hope will reach $1 million.
   In another bad sign for Gore, the Jewish voters surveyed by
Marist still supported Dukakis overwhelmingly, despite efforts by
the Gore campaign to win them over by taking a hard pro-Israel line
on Middle East issues.
   Seventy percent of the Jews in the Marist poll backed Dukakis,
just 12 percent chose Gore and 6 percent favored Jackson. Jews
account for up to a quarter of the Democratic primary vote in New
York.
   The Marist poll found Jackson with his customary overwhelming
black support and support from about 16 percent of white voters.
``The number really needs to reach into the 20s in order for him to
overtake Dukakis,'' Miringoff said.
   The polls did indicate some room for movement: 5 percent were
uncommitted and 8 percent undecided in Marist's poll, 8 percent
uncommitted and 11 percent undecided in the CBS survey. The
ABC-Post poll had 6 percent favoring some other candidate and 2
percent undecided.
   The CBS poll was conducted by telephone Monday through Wednesday
among 581 likely Democratic voters and has a margin of error of 4
percentage points. The ABC-Post poll was conducted by telephone
Wednesday among 176 likely voters, and has a margin of error of 9
points.
   The Marist poll has a margin of error of 5 percentage points.

   Here is a comparison of some major spending
categories in the $1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 budgets proposed by
President Reagan and passed by the House and Senate.
   The comparison does not include automatically allocated
expenditures, such as Social Security and Medicare benefits, but
does include administrative costs. The figures are cash outlays in
billions of dollars, the estimates provided by the Senate Budget
Committee.
   The Senate approved a late amendment increasing outlays for the
war on drugs by $1.4 billion in fiscal 1989. The spending, spread
over several categories, is not included in these estimates.

<HEAD>Greenhouse Effect: Results May Show Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the last century or so mankind has been
engaged in an unintentional experiment with the Earth's climate.
The results should be available soon, a scientist reports today.
   Warming of the Earth, caused by industrial gases spilled into
the atmosphere, could soon be large enough to measure with
assurance, said V. Ramanathan of the University of Chicago.
   ``Thus, the greenhouse theory of climate change has reached the
crucial stage of verification because of the inadvertent experiment
being performed on the atmosphere by human activities,'' Ramanathan
reported in the journal Science.
   ``In a decade or two we should start to see something. If not,
then it's time to go back to the drawing boards,'' Ramanathan said
in a telephone interview.
   ``The one fly in the ointment,'' he cautioned, is that the
relatively small changes seen so far have occurred in steps and not
gradually.
   Thus, if climate waits until the gases build up to a point to
``kick'' over a change, it may take longer to see warming, he said.
In that case, significant changes might take 20 to 50 years, he
said.
   Signs could include larger temperature rises in polar areas than
near the equator; less precipitation in the middle latitudes where
many crops are grown, and a rise in ocean levels, Ramanathan said.
   Industrial gases can lead to climate change because they act
somewhat like the glass of a greenhouse, allowing energy from the
sun to come to Earth, but trapping some of the heat that previously
would have radiated back out into space. Such gases include carbon
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons.
   This trapped energy drives the Earth's climate out of balance,
says Ramanathan.
   If the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continues,
he adds, ``the cumulative surface warming would, in the next two
decades, become large enough to manifest itself unambiguously.''
   ``The predicted changes, during the next few decades, could far
exceed the natural climate variations in historical times,'' he
wrote.
   Measurements over the last century or so indicate that the
planet has warmed about 1 degree Fahrenheit. That amount of change
could just be part of the natural variation in climate, he said.
   But if concentrations of greenhouse gases continue increasing,
theoretical models indicate the warming could total as much as 8
degrees Fahrenheit during the next century, a change Ramanathan
termed ``unprecedented.''
   Still in question, though, are the consequences of such a change.
   For example, the warming could cause some melting of polar ice,
a process that would tend to accelerate the warming even more by
increasing the sunlight absorbed by the darker underlying water or
land surfaces, Ramanathan reported.
   Ice melting could cause an increase in ocean levels, causing
widespread flooding of coastal areas, scientists have warned. And
many have expressed concern that the warming could cause changes in
general weather and climate patterns.
   Another area of uncertainty, Ramanathan wrote, is that of cloud
formation.
   Warmer temperatures might increase the water evaporated to form
clouds.
   Those clouds might reduce the incoming energy by brightening the
planet's surface and reflecting more sunlight back into space,
causing a cooling of the Earth.
   Yet clouds also are good at trapping infrared radiation headed
back into space from Earth. Thus they possibly could raise the
surface temperature instead of cooling it.

<HEAD>Reagan May Go To Moscow Without Ratified Arms Pact</HEAD>

   Senate leaders say the chamber is not in any
hurry to vote on the U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium-range
nuclear weapons, raising the possibility the pact may not be
ratified before President Reagan visits Moscow six weeks from now.
   ``I'm not driven by a calendar deadline. I want first, last and
always to have a good treaty,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., told reporters Thursday.
   The Reagan administration has pushed for a ratification vote
before Reagan's May 29-June 2 meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, but Byrd said there is a possible ``hole in the treaty''
that first has to be filled.
   That question revolves around whether the treaty bans so-called
``futuristic'' weapons, using exotic technologies such as lasers,
plasma, or ion beams.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, said the treaty is not likely to come to the
Senate floor before early May, after the chamber returns from a
week-long recess.
   When the Senate finally votes, ratification is probable,
according to both Byrd and Republican leaders. Ratification
requires a vote of 67 of the 100 senators, and both parties say the
treaty will likely be supported by 88 to 90 senators.
   The Armed Services Committee has been meeting behind closed
doors with administration officials, including chief treaty
negotiator Maynard Glitman, to try to resolve the issue of which
technologies are banned.
   The treaty doesn't mention futuristic weapons, but Glitman and
administration officials have said the Soviet Union understands the
pact bars the possession or flight testing of all medium-range
weapons, no matter how they are armed or operate.
   The Armed Services panel has already endorsed the pact, but it
is planning to issue another report on the ``futuristic'' weapons
issue, and Byrd said no floor action is likely before that report
is done.
   Two former top Reagan administration officials said in letters
released Thursday they don't believe the treaty bans futuristic
weapons.
   The pair, former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and former
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Director Kenneth Adelman,
outlined their views in letters to the Armed Services Committee.
   Weinberger wrote, ``I can simply state that there was no
understanding of any kind that I knew about that the treaty covered
anything related to these so-called futuristic weapons.''
   ``Certainly, there was no discussion or evaluation of the
military sufficiency questions involved in banning futuristic
weaponry that I ever participated in, and I never heard any others
having such a discussion,'' said Weinberger.
   ``Indeed, had there been any suggestions that `futuristic'
weapons were banned, I would have opposed it in the strongest
possible terms, because it would have had an obvious adverse effect
on (the Strategic Defense Initiative) for us to agree to any
limitation on any systems not yet designed or `futuristic' systems
...'' Weinberger said.
   Adelman said he never knew about any such ban that was discussed
in National Security Council meetings he attended or in ``any
meeting with Soviet officials with which I am familiar.''
   Meanwhile, Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus,
a private group, announced a nationwide campaign to defeat the
treaty or to delay the Senate vote.
   Phillips said black umbrellas emblazoned with anti-treaty
rhetoric would be sent to all senators to symbolize the campaign.
   ``Open, the umbrella symbolizes the protective shield which, for
more than four decades, has prevented Soviet domination and
intimidation of Europe,'' said Phillips.
   ``Closed, the umbrella today symbolizes the spirit of
appeasement and the lack of resolve which characterized (British
Prime Minister) Neville Chamberlain's dealings with Adolph Hitler
at Munich precisely 50 years ago.''

<TEXT>
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias is urging
President Reagan to tell Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at
their summit meeting that continuing Soviet weapons shipments to
Central America are undermining peace efforts in the region.
   Arias rejected Soviet denials that they are supporting rebels in
Guatemala and El Salvador and said a stable peace in Central
America may be beyond reach if the Kremlin does not change its
policy.
   Arias said Thursday that Secretary of State George P. Shultz
should prepare for the Moscow summit next month by meeting with the
five Central American foreign ministers, Nicaragua's included.
   Such an encounter would end a three-year freeze on substantive
diplomatic contacts between the United States and Nicaragua's
leftist government.
   U.S. officials, insisting on anonymity, said there is no
prospect for a meeting along the lines proposed by Arias unless the
Sandinista government demonstrates a clear will to negotiate
seriously with the Contra rebels when talks on a permanent
settlement are held.
   U.S. special envoy Morris Busby sounded out leaders from four
Central American countries friendly to the United States last week
and they generally agreed the time was not ripe for a regional
consultation that would include the United States and Nicaragua,
the officials said.
   Arias himself had expressed that view last week and one U.S.
official expressed surprise that the Costa Rican leader had made
the proposal Thursday without reference to the qualifications he
had made in his talks with Busby.
   Arias, author of the Central American peace plan, talked about
his proposal during a luncheon appearance before the American
Society of Newspaper Editors and later discussed it with Vice
President George Bush.
   At the luncheon, he was sharply critical of the Soviet Union.
   Following the congressional cutoff of U.S. military aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels in February, Arias sent an open letter to
Gorbachev appealing for similar Soviet restraint. He said he
received a response from the Soviet Foreign Ministry that contained
a ``lot of cynicism.''
   The Soviets denied sending aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador
and Guatemala and also said they were supporting Nicaragua's
leftist government militarily because the United States was
supplying its allies in the region, Arias said.
   He said it is ``quite obvious'' that both Cuba and the Soviet
Union are supporting the leftist insurgencies in El Salvador and
Guatemala in violation of the peace plan the five Central American
president signed last August.
   The Reagan administration has accused Cuba of sending weapons to
leftist forces in the region but has not made the same allegation
recently about the Soviets.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro said recently that his country
provides ``political and moral support'' to the Salvadoran rebels
but that there is no need to send them weapons because they are
self-sufficient.
   Arias said he decided to write to Gorbachev and not to Castro
because the Cuban leader would not be sending weapons to Central
American insurgents without the Kremlin's consent.
   In his prepared remarks, Arias said the Soviets send military
supplies ``worth millions'' to Central America.
   ``We ought to obligate the Soviet Union to rectify its policy
about Central America, and we need for it the political backing of
all friendly nations,'' he said.
   ``The coming withdrawal of Russian troops from Afghanistan
provides hope for the political rectification needed in Central
America.''
   The Reagan administration has said the Soviets sent about $450
million in military supplies to Nicaragua last year and that
shipments over the first two months this year were above the
comparable period in 1987.

   The dreaded income-tax deadline is here, but
some folks headed for the midnight mail will also be given a chance
to bash a used car, gobble headache powder, sip coffee or nibble
frozen yogurt.
   Some communities have decided to brighten the typically somber
undertaking by making it into an ``event.'' Those frustrated by the
new tax forms, for example, may want to do their mailing in Little
Rock, Ark.
   Radio station KZOU-FM will broadcast from a parking lot where
the Postal Service has set up a special mail box, to be collected
at midnight.
   The station will offer last-minute taxpayers a chance to vent
their feelings by taking a sledgehammer to a used car. A small
charge for taking part will be used for charity.
   Things will be a little more festive in Phoenix, where the
Postal Service has set up special collection points at shopping
centers.
   Frozen yogurt bars will be offered to taxpayers by radio station
KOOL-FM, while at another location KESZ-FM will give out fast food
coupons, said postal service spokeswoman Margot Myers.
   Tax night in her city has become ``quite an event,'' she
remarked.
   The nation's capital isn't exempt, either, with the Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts joining in.
   The Center is using the rite of last-minute tax filing to
promote the performance of ``The Rite of Spring.'' A postal clerk
will set up shop at the Center from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. for patrons
of the arts to buy stamps and mail their taxes en route to their
dose of culture.
   For Arkansans who have been too busy completing their taxes to
consider going to a concert, North Little Rock radio station
KSSN-FM is setting up a ``tax aid'' station to give out coffee,
donuts and headache powders at the general mail facility there, the
Postal Service reports.
   Those who prefer Alka-Seltzer with their coffee, donuts and
taxes can head north to Madison, Wis., where station WIBA will
offer succor to the late filers.
   Postal Service consumer advocate Ann Robinson in Washington said
she couldn't be specific about the last day, but that the post
office expects to handle 30 million tax returns nationwide in the
``last couple of days.''
   Robinson reminded taxpayers to use the correct postage _ under
this month's rate hike, it now costs a quarter for the first ounce
and 20 cents for each added ounce. She also encouraged use of the
Internal Revenue Service envelopes because they make the mail
easier for postal workers to handle.
   Taxpayers seeking last-minute postmarks annually flock to post
offices, and service until midnight will be available in many
communities to accommodate them, she reported.
   Indeed, streetcorner collection for people driving by will be
available in dozens of cities.
   In Baltimore, the move this year is to decentralize the postal
rush.
   ``Traditionally we have quite a bit of congestion at the main
office on that night, so we're trying to solve that,'' explained
spokeswoman Gloria Cheek.
   Special pickups have been scheduled for mail deposit boxes in
front of Baltimore's 33 postal stations. That mail will be
collected at 11:30 p.m., and postmarked April 15, she said.
   Washington radio station WCXR is offering contest winners free
stamps and a limousine ride to the post office.
   Volunteer or government tax preparers will be on hand to help
late filers in many locations including New York, Little Rock,
Peoria, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Richmond, Va., Baltimore and
Washington.
   Postal workers will collect tax returns from motorists at all
four corners of the Birmingham main post office and a clerk will be
stationed inside to weigh items and sell stamps until midnight.
   In Los Angeles, the Terminal Annex and Worldway Postal centers
will be open until midnight, and a hotline to the main post office
will give information on other late collection points in Van Nuys,
Santa Ana and Long Beach.
   An Express Mail van manned with two clerks will be parked in
front of the Denver Main post office to collect tax forms until
midnight. And in Minneapolis, two-ton collection trucks will loom
at three locations around the main post office.

<HEAD>House, Senate Will Spar Over `Creative Accounting' In Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate passage of a $1.1 trillion fiscal 1989
budget sets up a battle with the House over domestic spending and
how far Congress can stray from its deficit-reduction pact with
President Reagan.
   This year's budget debate is framed by the bipartisan agreement
with the president, which sets out limits for taxes and major
spending categories.
   Both the House and Senate have now passed budgets obeying the
pact's spending caps of $294 billion for the military and $16.1
billion in foreign aid. And neither chamber included tax increases
beyond the $14 billion enacted last December.
   So when the two sides begin meeting next week to resolve their
differences, the focus will be on domestic programs.
   The Senate plan, approved Thursday by a 69-26 vote, is similar
to the House plan in supporting large increases in spending on AIDS
research, education, and aviation safety. Both also reject Reagan's
request to terminate several domestic programs.
   But the Senate plan is closer to the president's in several
areas. It contains sharp increases for the space program and
science. The House last month opted for more modest boosts in those
areas in order to better protect mass transit, housing and
development programs.
   Both plans fudge the numbers in order to claim they stay within
the domestic spending limits, but they do it in different ways.
   The House voted to use what Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., called ``creative accounting'' _ simply
declaring that some expenses were not covered by the agreement.
   The Senate, eager to make room for a new $2.6 billion anti-drug
program but unwilling to make cuts elsewhere in the budget, at the
last minute set up a special fund. Declaring the money wouldn't be
tapped unless a ``dire emergency'' were declared, the budget simply
doesn't count that spending yet.
   Still, budget leaders from the two chambers said they hoped to
reach agreement quickly.
   ``There are obvious differences,'' House Budget Committee
Chairman William H. Gray III, D-Pa., said in a written statement.
``With good will, I am sure these differences can be resolved.''
   Chiles said the talks between the two chambers would begin next
week and, he hoped, go quickly.
   But Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican
on the budget committee, said, ``It is a more formidable challenge
than I thought it would be'' in the wake of the deficit agreement.
   The budget is a congressional resolution which does not require
the president's signature, but it guides lawmakers as they pass
their annual fiscal legislation.
   Congress has a self-imposed deadline of April 15 for finishing
the budget. It has failed to meet the deadline again, but things
are closer to being resolved at this date than they have been in
recent years.
   There was no expression of concern in either the House or Senate
about the tardiness. While millions of taxpayers must file their
returns by midnight tonight or face a penalty, there's no
punishment for the lawmakers if they don't figure out on time how
to spend the tax dollars.
   Those tax dollars still don't cover government expenses in
either the administration's or Congress' budgets. But they all
claim to meet the $136 billion deficit target of the Gramm-Rudman
budget-balancing law.
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., said even those deficit numbers were
based on too-optimistic White House estimates of a growing economy.
   ``The wreckage of our fiscal policy will haunt the next
president and presidents to come,'' he said.

   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker wants Hall of Famer
Babe Ruth to be honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom,
nearly 40 years after the baseball slugger's death.
   Ruth was a ``true American hero'' who ``epitomized the very best
of our national pastime,'' Weicker, R-Conn., said Thursday.
   The medal, the nation's highest civilian award, is given by the
president for contributions to national security, world peace or
``significant private or public endeavors.'' Seventy-one Medals of
Freedom have been awarded by President Reagan.
   Weicker, in a letter to Reagan nominating Ruth for the award,
noted the athlete's off-the-field contributions.
   ``He had great compassion for the sick and dying,'' the senator
said. ``Against the advice of many, Babe Ruth visited those
afflicted with Hansen's Disease in Kalappapa, Hawaii, and offered
those condemned to the `leper' colony his love and kindness.''
   Well known for his visits to sick children, Ruth also
established the Babe Ruth Foundation for underprivileged children
shortly before his death and left it a large part of his estate.
   Born in 1895 in Baltimore, George Herman Ruth hit 714 home runs
in 22 major league seasons with the Boston Red Sox, New York
Yankees and Boston Braves.
   A star pitcher early in his career, Ruth's career home run total
stood as the major league record until Hank Aaron broke it in 1974.
   Ruth died Aug. 16, 1948, at the age of 53.
   Other baseball players who have received the award include
former Yankee great Joe DiMaggio and the late Jackie Robinson, who
became the first black in the major leagues in the modern era when
he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.

   Tourists at Philadelphia's Independence
National Historical Park aren't getting the whole story about the
birth of the nation, says a group fighting for U.S. recognition of
a burial ground for George Washington's army.
   The 2,000 members of the undermanned army were buried more than
210 years ago in what is now Washington Square, and they should be
honored by making the square a national park, a Senate energy and
lands subcommittee was told Thursday.
   Washington Square receives scant tourist attention compared to
adjacent Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell.
   ``How pathetic that these greatest of patriots were buried
without even a headstone to mark their contribution,'' Philadelphia
attorney Malcolm Lazin said. ``The fact that Washington Square is
not a part of our National Park Service is a disgrace to their
memory and an embarrassment to all who pride themselves on being an
American.''
   In 1777, John Adams, later the second president, wrote in a
letter to his wife, ``I never in my whole life was affected with
such melancholy'' as at the sight of the graves and trenches. Adams
wrote he had been told that ``upwards of 2,000 soldiers'' were
buried at Potter's Field, later renamed Washington Square.
   Only in 1957 was the flame of the tomb of the Unknown
Revolutionary War Soldier placed at the square.
   Now, it is time that ``those who fought and died and are buried
in unmarked mass graves in Washington Square should be honored and
celebrated by the United States,'' said William E. W. Gowen of the
Pennsylvania Society of the Sons of the Revolution.
   Sponsors have placed no price tag on the bill. Sen. John Heinz,
R-Pa., and other backers envision Philadelphia, which owns the
land, leasing it to the National Park Service, perhaps for $1 a
year.
   ``As the bicentennial of the Constitution has just been
celebrated, we must not forget those who made it possible,'' Heinz
said.
   A similar bill was introduced by Rep. Tom Foglietta, D-Pa.,
during the previous session of Congress. It passed the House, but
was not acted on in the Senate.

   Emotional ceremonies remembering the victims
of Nazi atrocities included warnings against modern-day rights
abuses and an award to an Idaho town for resisting Nazi-style white
supremacists in the 1980s.
   Survivors of Nazi arrests 50 years ago wept as they lit candles
Thursday with members of Congress in the annual ``Days of
Remembrance'' program of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council.
   The ceremonies at the State Department also featured a hymn
honoring Gypsy victims of Nazi atrocities, prayers by protestant
and Catholic clergymen, and an appeal from Deputy Secretary of
State John C. Whitehead that America not turn its back on human
rights abuses around the world.
   Whitehead said he was shaken by a visit to the Auschwitz
concentration camp in February.
   ``Do not forget, and do not allow the world to forget the
inhumanity of which mankind is capable when it denies the sanctity
of human life,'' he said.
   Whitehead said the United States should ``resist the recurrent
American temptation toward isolationism'' and continue to work for
human rights in other countries.
   High standards of education and culture attained by the Germans
did not insulate them from ``the virus of religious and racial
prejudice,'' he said.
   The council, which was set up by Congress in 1980 to build a $50
million memorial in the District of Columbia, awarded an Eisenhower
Liberation Medal to retired Gen. James M. Gavin, who commanded
forces that helped defeat the Germans and liberate Wobbelin
concentration camp.
   ``We who did our share, we won't forget _ never will we forget,
never,'' said Gavin after the audience of several hundred
officials, diplomats and other guests gave him a standing ovation.
   Mayor Raymond Stone of Couer d'Alene, Idaho, also received an
Eisenhower medal for being among the first U.S. soldiers into
Wobbelin.
   In addition, Stone accepted a certificate honoring Couer d'Alene
citizens for ``standing fast and speaking out in the face of
threats and violence perpetrated by the members of a neo-Nazi
paramilitary group,'' the Aryan Nations, which made its
headquarters near the town in 1982.
   ``Constant vigilance is the price of freedom,'' the town's award
read.
   Stone, who was a high school and college history teacher before
being elected mayor in 1986, said he spent only a few minutes in
the concentration camp, but it changed his life.
   He said he tried to instill in his students the conviction that
``this thing must not happen again.''
   The program included a ceremony in which six members of Congress
and six people who survived the wave of arrests of Jews in November
1938 lit candles.
   Helga Lesser Franks, now an Evanston, Ill., travel agent, wept
as she participated in the candle-lighting with Rep. John E.
Porter, R-Ill.
   She said later she was 11 when soldiers stormed through Berlin,
burning her Jewish school and the synagogue next to her home.
   ``I can't help reliving it and being amazed that I am here
now,'' said Ms. Franks. She said she had never participated as part
of a Holocaust observance program.
   The site for the Holocaust Memorial, next to the Bureau of
Printing and Engraving, has been cleared and construction is
expected to take about 2{ years.

   Congressional proposals to raise the minimum
wage and require employer-sponsored health insurance could save
taxpayers millions of dollars in subsidies for the poor and
uninsured, according to a labor union study released today.
   ``Our study shows that the public picks up an enormous tab for
those employers who pay their workers sub-poverty wages and offer
no health coverage,'' the Service Employees International Union
said of its study of Los Angeles home care workers.
   By the union's calculations, ``passing the current minimum wage
and minimum health bills in Congress would reduce taxpayer
subsidies to Los Angeles' (home care) program by $32.7 million in
1992.''
   The savings would be achieved through reductions in cash
assistance, Medicaid and Medicare, and indigent care costs, as well
as higher tax collections from home health care workers, the union
said.
   Congress is weighing plans to increase the minimum wage from the
current $3.35 to $5.05 in 1992 and to require employers to provide
minimum health benefits to their workers.
   The service employees union based its conclusions on a survey of
1,031 home health workers in Los Angeles County. The workers,
roughly representative demographically of the county's 40,000 home
care employees, earn an average of $3.72 an hour.
   Sixty percent of those surveyed had no health insurance and more
than half needed public support through direct cash benefits from
the government or health services from public hospitals and
community clinics.
   Assuming similar proportions throughout the home services work
force, the study said, public subsidies for cash and health
benefits amount to $84 million a year. Federal dollars underwrite
61 percent of these subsidies, the study said.
   The SEIU study was released in conjunction with House hearings
Thursday and today on the health plan.
   
   _ End Embargoed Material _
   
   A so-called ``minimum health'' bill, introduced by Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., has already
cleared the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
   It would require employers to provide a minimum health insurance
package to people working 17.5 hours a week or more. Benefits would
have to include hospital and doctor care, prenatal and baby care,
diagnostic testing and catastrophic protection.
   Employers would pay at least 80 percent of the premium. Pool
arrangements and a phase-in period would make plans more affordable
to small or new firms. The Senate version of the bill also says
very small or new employers would only have to provide catastrophic
protection.
   There are an estimated 37.2 million Americans without health
insurance. About two-thirds of them are workers or dependents who
would be covered by the Kennedy-Waxman bill.
   In testimony Thursday to the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on health, chaired by Waxman, the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce argued that the Kennedy-Waxman bill would cause many
workers to lose other benefits and maybe even their jobs.
   But the president of another business group cited a strong and
``growing trend of acceptance among many major companies.''
   ``With each month, we hear from more members who think that a
federal mandate is far from the worst alternative. And, many of the
changes we wanted have been accepted,'' said Willis Goldbeck,
president of the Washington Business Group on Health, which
represents hundreds of Fortune 500 companies and other employers.
   One small-business owner told the subcommittee he feels
ethically obligated to offer medical insurance. He urged passage of
the bill, saying it would make policies more affordable and even
the playing field.
   ``In my attempts to be responsible now and in the future, I am
put at a competitive disadvantage against those (employers) who do
not insure,'' said John Lester, owner of a carpentry and
construction firm in Warren, N.H.
   Lester said he had been on the other side of the fence and
experienced long-term debt when his wife became ill. Other
uninsured employees also recounted their experiences with sporadic,
inadequate medical care and sky-high bills.

   Shrimpers nationwide have been granted a
reprieve from federal regulations requiring them to outfit their
vessels with devices to exclude turtles from their nets.
   U.S. District Judge Patrick Carr in New Orleans told the
government Tuesday to stop enforcing the regulations until the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rules on a lawsuit filed by the
Louisiana attorney general's office and Concerned Shrimpers of
Louisiana.
   Shrimpers contend the devices are expensive, cumbersome, and
would drastically cut the size of their catch. Environmentalists
say they are necessary to protect endangered and threatened species
of turtles.
   Carr upheld the regulations as lawful in a Feb. 29 ruling but
decided this week to prohibit enforcement while his earlier ruling
is appealed.
   ``We're pleased that Judge Carr agreed with the state's argument
that little harm, if any, would be done to sea turtles if shrimpers
continue to trawl without TEDs (turtle excluder devices) until the
case is finally adjudicated,'' Louisiana Attorney General William
Guste Jr. said on learning of the ruling Thursday.
   ``We argued that shrimpers would have to go to great trouble and
expense to equip their nets with TEDs,'' he said. ``The possibility
remains that the appeals court will reverse Carr's (earlier) ruling
and not require shrimpers to use TEDs.''
   Guste said Louisiana shrimpers could lose up to 15 percent of
their catches if they have to use the devices, meaning less tax
revenue for the state.
   In his order this week, Carr said shrimpers have had trouble
obtaining the TEDs and getting adequate training in their use.
   ``We still maintain the regulations are valid and lawful and
necessary to protect turtles,'' said Jay Johnson, an attorney for
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington.
``We're preparing the papers to seek a cancellation of his order
and an expedited ruling from the court of appeals.''
   NOAA drafted the regulations to protect endangered and
threatened turtles, most notably the ``critically endangered''
Kemp's ridley sea turtle, Johnson said.
   ``I'm thrilled with Judge Carr's ruling. This is the first major
victory in the shrimpers' battle to stop TED regulations, and it is
important recognition that the TED regulations are impractical,''
said Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas.
   ``NOAA and the environmentalists will probably ask that the
court of appeals to overturn this decision, but I believe that the
evidence is overwhelming that shrimper compliance is impossible,''
said Ortiz.
   NOAA was phasing in the regulations depending on location _ they
took effect March 1 along the Gulf Coast, on Jan. 1 in southwest
Florida near the Keys, and in October near Florida's Cape
Canaveral, Johnson said. The regulations were to take effect for
the rest of the Atlantic coast May 1.
   ``We know they don't work,'' Tee John Mialjevich of Louisiana,
president and executive director of Concerned Shrimpers of America,
said of the TEDs.
   More than 100 shrimping vessels converged on the Florida Keys in
February to protest the regulations, Mialjevich said.
   Elizabeth Megginson, an assistant state attorney general in
Louisiana, said the devices would create enormous problems for
shrimpers and the state, which would have to help enforce the law.
   Louisiana has 32,000 commercial and recreational shrimpers, and
there weren't enough of the devices on the market to go around, she
said.

   Israeli orders to demolish a
new mosque being built by villagers in their spare time has stirred
religious and nationalist passions in this West Bank village.
   Hundreds of Arabs formed a human wall around the dusty hilltop
site Thursday after the Israeli military government ordered the
mosque torn down because it was being erected without a permit.
   ``If the bulldozers arrive, they will have to bury us inside the
mosque,'' Seif Khatib, 50, said as he and hundreds of other
villagers surrounded the half-finished limestone building.
   Villagers claimed the permit was withheld to punish them for
taking part in the 18-week anti-Israeli uprising and for refusing
to accept Israeli-appointed leadership.
   Since Dec. 8, at least 146 Palestinians, an Israeli soldier and
a 15-year-old Jewish settler have been killed in riots in the
occupied territories.
   But Israeli officials said they want to halt construction
because the new mosque, an annex to a 61-year-old mosque, was built
over archaeological ruins that may help identify Anata as the
birthplace of a biblical prophet.
   The military government approved a four-day reprieve hours
before the scheduled demolition Thursday, but the dispute has
produced strong anti-Israeli sentiment among villagers.
   ``The Israelis don't want more mosques. They are afraid it will
help the Islamic movement. And because of the uprising, they want
to take revenge against us,'' said Khatib, wearing a white prayer
cap and a gray pin-striped robe.
   Minutes later, an army jeep pulled up the hill, and shouts of
``The soldiers are coming!'' swept through the crowd. Village
elders in white Arab headdresses restrained hot-headed youths
pushing toward the jeep, telling them not to provoke the soldiers.
   A lieutenant colonel climbed out of the jeep and toured the
mosque with village elders. The officer told residents that they
had won a reprieve until Monday, when the military government is to
meet with Anata residents.
   Olivier Rafovitch, a spokesman for the military government,
indicated the demolition order might be canceled to avoid a violent
confrontation.
   ``We know religous matters are very sensitive and we are going
to work out a solution,'' Rafovitch said.
   He said a construction permit was denied because the mosque was
being built on ruins from the Byzantine, Roman, Hellenistic periods
and even the Iron Age.
   One of the mosque's outer walls is a yard away from the roofless
ruins of a Byzantine church.
   Avram Biran, an archaeologist who has excavated sites in nearby
villages, said remains underneath the church might provide clues as
to whether Anata, called Anathoth (City of Refuge) in the Bible,
was the birthplace of the prophet Jeremiah.
   He noted that Anata, just northeast of Jerusalem, has been
declared an historical site, and that all building was strictly
regulated.
   But villagers claimed the military government was trying to
punish them for refusing to accept Israel-appointed village leaders.
   Construction of the mosque began about two months ago to provide
more space for worshipers who have been forced to pray in the
streets surrounding the old mosque.
   Residents have donated material and about 200 villagers labored
at the site in their spare time.
   ``This is our mosque and I worked hard,'' said 15-year-old
Moussa Abd Saleh, who helped carry bricks and mix cement.
   ``It is a gift to God,'' added Khatib. ``This land should be
exempt from regulations.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Urges The Outlawing of Witchcraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Witchcraft is sweeping Britain and must be
outlawed so British children don't fall into the ``sordid, sexual
and diabolical grasp'' of those who practice it, a lawmaker told
the House of Commons.
   Geoffrey Dickens, of the governing Conservative Party, asserted
Thursday that many people convicted of child abuse had been
involved in witchcraft initiation ceremonies.
   ``People laughed when I spoke nine years ago about child abuse.
Most people are listening now,'' said Dickens, asking for a debate
on the subject. ``I now warn the House _ witchcraft is sweeping the
country.''
   His comments were met with laughter from other lawmakers. House
leader John Wakeham rejected the call for a debate but urged
Dickens to pursue the subjects he thought important.
   Later, Dickens said he would urge the introduction of
legislation banning witchcraft, with prison sentences for offenders.
   ``These are extremely devious, evil people,'' he said. ``If we
are to protect children from their sordid, sexual and diabolical
grasp we must bring in new laws to wipe witches off the face of the
earth.''
   He said he had evidence that a vicar in northern England had
surveyed 300 14-year-old pupils, and 87 percent had said they had
dabbled in the occult.
   ``I have not gone mad,'' he said. ``This is a serious and
growing problem which must be exorcised.''
   The crime of witchcraft was abolished in 1951 with the repeal of
the 1735 Witchcraft Act.

   Strange smells noticed by noses from London to
France in the last week have confounded experts, who sniffed out
possible causes ranging from a No. 73 city bus to a freak change in
the atmosphere.
   After an unpleasant gas-like odor caused one of the biggest
evacuations in peacetime Britain Wednesday in a busy shopping area,
an even more widespread smell Thursday was reported by hundreds of
people in calls to fire and environmental officials.
   ``I could smell it when I left my home in Kingston (southwest
London) this morning,'' said a fire brigade spokeswoman. ``When I
got off the train in central London I could still smell it.''
   Friends of the Earth environmental group was inundated with
calls from residents in Oxfordshire, Kent, London and Essex, all in
the south of England within a 50-mile radius of London.
   ``I contacted our office in Paris and apparently there was a
similar smell in France last week,'' said an official from Friends
of the Earth, speaking anonymously in keeping with British practice.
   ``The theory is that it was caused by a freak atmospheric
condition.''

   A lack of funds and the growing populist

a staff member says.
   Traficant press secretary Paul Marcone confirmed Thursday a

   Traficant launched his presidential bid last year, saying he

Rust Belt economic problems.
   But the congressman told the newspaper he is no longer raising
funds for his presidential campaign and will buy only a few small

<HEAD>Half Of Old Growth in Northwest's National Forests to Be Sold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the U.S. Forest Service is
defending a plan to log about half the old-growth timber in Pacific
Northwest national forests, saying such action is needed to
maintain the region's forest products industry.
   In testimony Thursday before the House Appropriations interior
subcommittee, forest service chief Dale Robertson predicted that
old-growth timber would have to be logged on about 3 million acres
in the next 50 years in Washington and Oregon because second-growth
trees are too young to sustain the harvest.
   ``Alternatives don't exist if you want to maintain the timber
industry in the Northwest,'' Robertson said.
   Rindy O'Brien, the Wilderness Society's director of government
affairs, said it was the most clear-cut signal to date of Forest
Service plans.
   ``It's not so much new as that they have finally been forced to
talk about the numbers publicly,'' said Ms. O'Brien.
   The head of the subcommittee, Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., likened
the harvest of old growth to cutting down ``Sherwood Forest'' of
Robin Hood fame.
   ``Are you stealing our heritage?'' he asked Robertson.
   ``We will be protecting some of our heritage and the
forest-products industry,'' Robertson replied.
   Robertson said there are roughly 7.5 million acres of what the
forest service considers old-growth forest in the Northwest, with
about 83 percent or 6.2 million acres in national forests.
   The agency plans to offer for sale about half those trees,
Robertson said. At present about 50,000 acres of old-growth timber
is harvested annually.
   About 700,000 acres of old-growth timber is included in various
wilderness areas in the region and already is protected from
logging.
   ``Are you going to cut ancient trees?'' Yates asked.
   ``I don't know what they are,'' Robertson said.
   Yates then asked whether the Forest Service would cut ``tall,
beautiful trees.''
   ``Yes,'' Robertson said.
   Yates said after the hearing that he was convinced there was
enough other
   timber available in Northwest forests to maintain a healthy
forest-products industry.
   ``There are plenty of other trees they can use,'' he said. ``You
don't have to build houses out of old trees. I would hate like the
devil to see these old, beautiful trees cut down.''

   An experienced skydiver who was killed
after leaping from a plane without a parachute had forgotten to put
on a chute before an earlier jump the same day, a federal
investigator says.
   Ivan McGuire, 35, fell 10,000 feet to his death April 2 while
filming an instructor and student at the Franklin County Sport
Parachute Center. The fatal jump was his third of the day.
   ``There was no problem with the first time, during which he
videotaped the jump of a student and instructor,'' Walter Rigsbee,
an inspector for the Federal Aviation Administration, said
Thursday. ``On the second, he forgot to put on his chute but one of
the other parachutists brought it to his attention before he
boarded the plane.''
   McGuire made the same mistake when he boarded the plane for the
third jump, but no one noticed, Rigsbee said.
   After viewing the tape McGuire made on that last jump,
investigators said it appeared McGuire had been reaching for the
release pin of a parachute that wasn't there.
   McGuire's videotaping may have caused confusion, Rigsbee said.
   ``The harness McGuire wore for the video equipment is similar to
that of a parachute. It has the same feel,'' he said.

   The dollar closed sharply lower against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo Friday, following the release of
higher-than-expected U.S. trade deficit figures. Stock prices also
declined.
   The dollar ended trading at 124.13 yen, down 2.02 yen from its
close of 126.15 yen Thursday. It had opened the day on Friday at
123.95 yen and ranged between 123.90 and 124.22 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which closed at a record 27,111.35 points
Thursday, lost 217.78 points to end the day at 26,893.57.
   Dealers in stock and currency markets said the unexpectedly
large U.S. trade deficit of $13.8 billion in February, as reported
Thursday by the Commerce Department in Washington, was the sole
factor behind the twin plunges.
   But in the stock market, prices rebounded on strong buying
sentiment among institutional investors, who saw no reason to sell
their holdings, said Hiromi Yoneyama of Wako Securities.
   ``The dollar does not seem to be falling further and there is no
pessimism in the air,'' he added.
   The dollar stabilized after reports that the Bank of Japan
stepped in to brake the currency's fall.
   Noburu Yokohashi, an official in the treasury division at
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, said Japan's central bank was placing orders
to buy dollars in ``considerable amounts.''

   The full Senate is being asked to consider

would receive a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without
parole.
   Genocide is the attempt to destroy or the destruction of a
national, ethnic, racial or religious group.
   The legislation, approved unanimously Thursday by the Senate
Judiciary Committee, would be the final step in linking the United
States with 96 other countries that have ratified the Genocide
Convention approved by the United Nations on Dec. 9, 1948.
   The Senate ratified the treaty 83-11 on Feb. 19, 1986, but it
could not be put into force without the criminal penalties
established in the current legislation. The mandatory life sentence
would apply to anyone found guilty by an international tribunal of
participating in acts of genocide that result in death.

<HEAD>Companies To Phase Out High-Estrogen Birth Control Pills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says birth control pill
manufacturers have agreed to phase out high-estrogen pills based on
a finding that they are no more effective than lower-dose pills and
could heighten the risk of blood clotting.
   The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday the three
manufacturers _ G.D. Searle and Co., Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. and
Syntex Corp. _ will phase out distribution of the pills over a
six-month period to allow physicians time to switch their patients
to lower-dose estrogen pills.
   The action follows a recommendation by an FDA advisory panel
that the high-dose pills _ those containing more than 50 micrograms
of estrogen _ be withdrawn because of the heightened risk of blood
clotting.
   ``I applaud the responsible decision of these manufacturers,''
FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said in a statement. ``Low dose
contraceptives are quite safe and, for healthy young women, are
considered to be the most effective reversible means of preventing
pregnancy.''
   The most commonly prescribed birth control pills contain 30
micrograms to 35 micrograms of estrogen and are not affected by the
phaseout. The ones being withdrawn contain from 75 micrograms to
100 micrograms of estrogen.
   They are sold by Syntex as Norinyl 2 and Norinyl 1 + 80, by
Searle as Enovid E-21 and Ovulen, and by Ortho as Ortho-Novum 1@80
and Ortho-Novum 2 mg.

<HEAD>Doctors Discuss Ethics of Harvesting Donor Organs from Doomed
Infants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The immediate harvesting of organs from infants
born with most of their brains missing could threaten entire groups
of patients who have lost the capacity for thought, two medical
ethicists say.
   Such a policy of taking the organs for transplant before the
infants are declared brain dead also violates medical ethics, said
John Arras and Dr. Shlomo Shinnar, writing in today's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   Because these infants, called anencephalic, inevitably die
within days or weeks and many children require organ transplants, a
debate has begun over the appropriateness of using anencephalics as
donors _ and how soon.
   ``These arguments are by no means unique to anencephalic
newborns,'' Arras and Shinnar wrote in their commentary.
   ``They are equally applicable to other severely damaged infants
as well as adults in permanent vegetative states. We do not believe
society is willing to harvest organs from living patients who have
permanently lost the capacity for intelligent thought.''
   Anencephalic infants have a brain stem, enabling them to
breathe. They have no cerebral cortex, the part of the brain
allowing thought and voluntary movement.
   Between 2,000 and 3,000 anencephalic infants are among the 3
million children born in the United States each year, the federal
Centers for Disease Control estimates.
   ``Organ donation is very laudable, and people say these kids
will inevitably die,'' Shinnar, a pediatric neurologist at
Montefiore Medical Center, The Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
said in a telephone interview from New York.
   But he added, ``What if there are not enough anencephalics and
the transplant needs are greater two years from now? Who do we look
at next?''
   The debate intensified in October following newspaper reports
that organs had been harvested from anencephalic infants and
transplanted into other children in West Germany and California.
   ``In the West German case, they took a baby from delivery, put a
tube (of oxygen) in its mouth, took it to the operating room,
harvested the organs and buried it,'' Shinnar said.
   ``And in the United States, although it did not pass, there was
a bill in the legislature in California to have these children
declared `brain-dead' at birth,'' he said.
   Legal definitions of brain death used in making medical
determinations require an end of all brain functions, including
those of the brain stem, Shinnar said.
   In December, the Loma Linda (Calif.) University Medical Center
developed a medical protocol under which anencephalic babies are to
be used for transplants only after brain death occurs.
   Six anencephalic infants were kept alive by respirator for a
week under those guidelines, though none ultimately became an organ
donor, said Loma Linda spokeswoman Anita Rockwell.
   ``We wrote our article before the protocol was developed,''
Shinnar said, ``and this certainly lessens the magnitude of the
ethical debate.''
   But, he said, ``this protocol is not without its problems as
well. What about extending the tragedy for the parents of an
anencephalic child?''
   Anencephaly can be detected before birth with ultrasound, the
commentary said, and some doctors consider abortion appropriate as
late as the final three months of pregnancy.
   ``Should we be encouraging pregnant women, in essence, to carry
these children to term to provide spare parts?'' Shinnar said.

<TEXT>
   Camilla Ravera, a founder of Italy's Communist Party
who championed women's rights and became the first woman elected to
the nation's Senate, has died, her family reported. She was 98.
   Miss Ravera's family said she died Thursday in her Rome
apartment.
   The lawmaker was one of just nine people given the honorary
title of senator for life and remained active in Italian politics
through 1983.
   She was arrested in 1930 for anti-fascist activities and
sentenced to 15 years in prison by a special tribunal. She served
five years in jail and eight in internal exile before being freed
after the Allied invasion of Italy.
   Although Miss Ravera had been a founder of Italy's Communist
Party, she was expelled from the party in 1943 because she bitterly
criticized Soviet leader Josef Stalin and the Soviet's 1939
non-aggression pact with the Nazis.
   She was reinstated during the 1950s and was elected to the
Senate in 1982.
   In Parliament, Miss Ravera was a champion of women's rights. She
also wrote a history of the women's movement in Italy.
   Miss Ravera had been a close friend of former President Sandro
Pertini, a Socialist, who nominated her for the honor of senator
for life.
   When Pertini was president, a group of students visiting the
presidential mansion asked if he thought a woman could be president.
   ``Why not,'' replied Pertini. ``One Camilla Ravera is an
example.''

<TEXT>
   There was no signs of celebration in
Peshawar's hot and dusty streets, no shots fired into the air as
people do in Central Asia when they are happy about something.
   The Soviets had just signed the Red Army's ticket home from
neighboring Afghanistan, but the prevailing mood among Afghan
refugees encamped here for years was skepticism and indifference.
   Tanvir Ahmad, a taxi driver, said: ``Agreement? What agreement?
... It will make no difference. The war will end when the refugees
go home.''
   In Camp No. 6 of the nearby border town of Munda sat 34-year-old
Israyal Ghairad, a school teacher from Kunar province in
northeastern Afghanistan
   ``We're not concerned with this agreement,'' Ghairad said of the
accords signed Thursday in Geneva.
   The Afghan Moslem guerrillas were not invited to the
negotiations that produced the withdrawal settlement. The accord
was signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United States and Soviet
Union.
   Ghairad said Pakistan and Afghanistan are not ``the real parties
to this war.''
   The Afghan rebels say the conflict is with the Soviets and not
the government in Kabul, the Afghan capital, which they consider a
Kremlin puppet. The guerrillas say no agreement is valid without
their participation.
   The seven-party guerrilla alliance did not issue a statement
after the signing Thursday, but said a resolution would be read
Saturday at a public rally outside Peshawar, the Pakistani border
city that serves as its headquarters.
   The statement is expected to repeat the guerrillas' position
that they will continue fighting until the last Soviet soldier
leaves Afghan soil. The Geneva agreement calls for the estimated
115,000 Soviet troops who began arriving in 1979 to begin leaving
May 15 and be out within nine months.
   Ghairad said: ``We will wait and see if there is entire peace in
Afghanistan and the Communists are no longer in power.''
   He said his family of five will not return home until he feels
it is safe there, and predicted the 5 million other Afghan refugees
in Pakistan and Iran would do the same.
   Tony Land, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
representative in Peshawar, said it was too early to prepare for a
return home by the refugees.
   Countries in both the East and West hailed the troop withdrawal
accord as a vital first step toward peace, and some offered to help
Afghan refugees.
   But skepticism remained over some aspects of the agreement,
particularly continued aid to combatants.
   The Times of India, an independent English-language daily, said
in an editorial titled ``Meaningless Agreement'':
   ``Moscow will be able to withdraw its troops without having to
acknowledge the plain fact that it has failed to pacify Afghanistan
in the face of resistance by U.S.-backed mujahedeen (guerrillas).
But on the face of it, the agreement will be pretty meaningless
otherwise.
   ``For it will stipulate that the Americans and the Russians will
continue to be entitled to provide arms to their respective
clients. And while Pakistan will formally agree not to interfere in
Afghanistan's internal affairs, it will in reality continue to do
so inasmuch as it will still serve as a conduit for U.S. arms
supplies to the mujahedeen.''

hospitals, but researchers say that rate of infection doesn't
necessarily apply to the nation.
   The national Centers for Disease Control, attempting to gauge
the prevalence of AIDS infection of the virus that causes AIDS,
tested blind blood samples from non-AIDS patients at 40
``sentinel'' hospitals in 30 cities.
   In results from the first four hospitals enrolled in the
program, all in the Midwest, 0.3 percent of the 12,000 tested
patients showed signs of AIDS virus infection, the CDC said in a
report made public Thursday.
   The early data, however, may not be representative of the
nation, said Dr. Tim Dondero, a CDC AIDS researcher. ``You can't do
a national estimate based on four spots,'' he said.
   Federal health officials continue to estimate that between 1
million and 1.5 million Americans are infected with AIDS virus.
   ``No new data have become available to prompt a change of this
estimate,'' the CDC said, adding, ``accurate estimates of the
prevalence ... of (AIDS virus) infection in the entire U.S.
population are not possible at this time.'' The agency expects to
enroll all 40 hospitals in its testing program by September.
   If 1.5 million of the nation's estimated 240 million population
were infected, the rate would be about 0.6 percent, about twice as
high as the early CDC results. One million Americans would be about
0.4 percent.
   The four hospitals reported that antibodies indicating AIDS
infection were more common among adults 25 to 44. Rates also were
higher for blacks and Hispanics than for whites, and higher for men
than for women, the CDC said.
   Those rates are comparable to national AIDS statistics, Dondero
noted, adding, ``The data look right.''
   As of this week, 59,287 cases of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome itself have been reported in the United States, according
to the CDC. The disease has so far killed 33,060, or 56 percent of
those patients.
   The CDC's report summarized the agency quarterly presentation on
AIDS to the Domestic Policy Council last month. The report also
reviewed tests among prisoners and among childbearing women.
   Out of 29,193 federal inmates tested by the U.S. Bureau of
Prisons since last June, 843, or 2.9 percent, have tested positive
for AIDS virus infection. That is little changed from a Justice
Department announcement last fall, when 3 percent of the first
inmates tested were positive.
   The CDC said it hopes to contract with the National Institute of
Justice and with a ``major university'' for AIDS testing of 10,000
inmates at 10 state prisons beginning this June.
   In 52,326 tests of childbearing women in the state of New York,
researchers found an AIDS virus infection rate of 0.8 percent, the
CDC said. In New York City, one woman in 61 showed antibodies
against the AIDS virus, and 40 percent of those women passed the
infections on to their newborn children, the CDC added.

<HEAD>Inmate Who Escaped from Death Row Is Executed</HEAD>

   Earl Clanton Jr. had pleaded for his life
and even escaped once from death row, but in the end he walked
wide-eyed and silent to his death in Virginia's electric chair for
the 1980 killing of a librarian.
   Rebuffed by the U.S. Supreme Court after his lawyers made a
frantic plea, Clanton, 33, was administered two jolts of
electricity late Thursday night and pronounced dead at 11:07 p.m.
   Outside the prison, about 50 opponents of capital punishment
conducted a vigil and prayer service. They were interrupted by a
single supporter of the death penalty who shouted, ``Pray for the
woman that died.''
   Clanton had been on death row since 1981 for the robbery and
strangling of Wilhemina Smith, a Petersburg school librarian who
lived in his apartment building.
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. granted
Clanton a stay to review evidence of childhood abuse that the
condemned man said he suffered. Attorneys for Clanton said he had
suppressed memories of the abuse and thus was incompetent to help
his trial lawyer in offering mitigating evidence at the sentencing
hearing.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned Merhige on Thursday afternoon, prompting a hurried
effort by Clanton's lawyers to stop the execution.
   The federal appeals court said that Clanton's case had been
given least 10 reviews in state and federal courts and that his
sentencing had been found constitutional.
   On Thursday night, the U.S. Supreme Court refused a stay in a
7-2 decision, with Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall
dissenting, and Gov. Gerald L. Baliles turned down a petition for
clemency.
   Clanton was visited by his mother, sister, two aunts and his
lawyers as the execution hour approached, said C. Dwight Perry, the
prison's operations officer.
   He also was visited by Jay North, the 1960s child television
star of ``Dennis the Menace.'' North has been working on a movie
about the 1984 escape of Clanton and five other Virginia death row
inmates.
   ``We became extremely close friends,'' said North, who opposes
the death penalty. ``We've been in contant communication, wrote and
called. We became like brothers.''
   Witnesses to the execution said Clanton was wide-eyed and
impassive and appeared only a little nervous as he was led into the
death chamber.
   In an interview Monday with the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot and The
Ledger-Star, Clanton complained about pressure being exerted by the
state to have him executed at the scheduled time.
   ``Why kill me today and be wrong in just a few months later?''
he said. ``What is the urgency? Why such an urgency to take such a
life.''
   In May 1984, Clanton was one of six death row inmates who
escaped from the Mecklenburg Correctional Center. He was recaptured
the next day at a coin laundry in Warrenton, N.C.

<HEAD>Bran Provides Low-Cost Alternative for Treating High Cholesterol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People on low-cholesterol diets can reduce their
blood-cholesterol level by eating oat-bran daily instead of taking
drugs which can cost three to six times as much, researchers say.
But hold the milk.
   ``The oat bran is not as effective as some of the pharmaceutical
products (in lowering) cholesterol, but it's effective,'' said Dr.
John Eisenberg, one of two authors of a study published in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Adding a bran muffin or bowl of oat-bran cereal to a daily diet
can cost about $250 a year, compared with some cholesterol-lowering
drugs which can cost as much as $1,450 a year, he said.
   The daily consumption of oat bran or other water-soluble fibers
has the positive effect in people who maintain low-cholesterol
diets, Eisenberg said in a telephone interview Thursday from the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
   Researchers concluded that each 1 percent reduction in the
cholesterol level translated into a 2 percent reduction in the risk
of coronary problems, such as heart attacks.
   Eisenberg and Dr. Bruce Kinosian of the University of
Maryland-Baltimore performed a cost-benefit analysis of three
treatments _ oat bran and the drugs cholestyramine resin and
colestipol _ being used for a clinical trial on 1,900 middle-aged
men with elevated cholesterol levels. The subjects had previously
changed their diets to lower cholesterol intake.
   Daily consumption of oat bran or other water-soluble fibers have
been shown to reduce the level of cholesterol by 13 percent to 19
percent, the range of most medications, Eisenberg said.
   A few drugs lower cholesterol as much as 25 percent, he said.
   Not all kinds of bran would work to lower cholesterol because
many, such as wheat bran, are not water soluble, Eisenberg said.
   Cholesterol, a form of fat contained in many foods, is deposited
in artery linings. It can cause blockages and hardening of the
arteries, restricting blood flow and increasing the likelihood of
heart problems.
   For purposes of the trial, an elevated level was considered to
be at least 260 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood serum.
   Over the seven-year trial, oat bran proved as effective as the
two drugs in triggering cholesterol reductions _ but at a fraction
of the cost, the analysis indicated.
   The maximum 19 percent reduction in cholesterol levels would
lower the risk of coronary problems 38 percent.
   Including the cost of regular medical supervision, a one-year
supply of cholestyramine taken daily was estimated at $1,442,
colestipol at $879 and oat bran at $249.
   ``If a person needs a certain type of prescription, there is no
way around that,'' Eisenberg said. ``But as it turns out, it's
probably more cost-effective to start treating hypercholesterolemia
with oat bran.
   ``One note, though. If you use milk with the muffins or cereal,
remember that you're adding some cholesterol,'' he said.

   After 40 years as one of America's most
successful playwrights, Neil Simon says he's thinking about taking
things a little easier.
   Simon, 60, was just 31 when his first play, ``Come Blow Your
Horn,'' opened on Broadway. Prior to that, he was a television
reporter for 10 years.
   ``That's 40 years of writing,'' he said in a recent interview.
``I don't anticipate grazing on a farm someplace, but this pace I
don't need anymore.
   ``Maybe I'll just write plays for regional theaters an not think
about going to Broadway. Maybe I'll stop in a couple of years and
just do watercolors. I don't know. I can't think beyond these two
plays. I only think in the present,'' said Simon, who has had 22
plays on Broadway.
   The two plays that are currently occupying his thoughts are
numbers 23 and 24.
   His 23rd Broadway production is ``Jake's Women,'' which is
already finished. The story of a writer and the ladies in his life
is scheduled to open in New York next year.
   Number 24 is a farce he is rewriting called ``Rumors,''
scheduled to make its world premiere at San Diego's Old Globe
Theatre in September before becoming his 24th play for the Broadway
stage.
   ``There's nothing safe in `Rumors,''' he said. ``It's a farce _
a style of comedy I've never written before. It's the most
complicated thing I've ever written .... I doubt if I'll ever do
another farce, because it's exhausting.''

   As many as 25,000 migrant workers have
arrived in Oregon more than a month before the strawberry crop is
ready to pick, and thousands are without food or shelter, relief
agencies say.
   Last year, there weren't enough workers to pick an early harvest
of strawberries, and 20 percent of the state's crop rotted in the
fields. Growers complained that Mexican pickers were confused over
the Immigration Reform Act of 1986 and refused to cross the border.
   This year, social service agencies are stretching to help an
estimated 18,000 to 25,000 early arrivals.
   ``Word got out that there were a lot of jobs and everybody was
afraid there would be such a rush that when they showed up it would
be too late,'' said Titus Herman of the Salvation Army.
   Marta Garcia, who operates the House of Zion emergency shelter
in Marion County, said she often sees 50 or 60 people living in one
room when they deliver food to migrant camps.
   ``We have people in the backyard in tents. We even have people
staying in the camper of our pickup because there's no place else
to go,'' she said. ``Everywhere you see that. They have no water,
no facilities. Many come here to take baths.''
   A Washington County grower who asked not to be identified said
many workers are asking farmers to sign papers saying they worked
for them at least 90 days each year from 1984 to 1986, as required
by the new law.
   ``A lot of them can't get legalized, but hope people will fill
out the forms for them,'' he said.
   The illegal workers are ``just hoping and praying they won't get
asked for papers, that farmers will be lenient toward them,'' Mrs.
Garcia said. ``We bring it up to them all the time, and they say,
`It's just the chance we're taking.'''
   David Beebe, district director of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said the law allows special agricultural
workers to enter the country this year if they pay a $185
application fee and promise to provide papers from former employers.
   The law offers amnesty to illegal aliens who have been in the
United States since before 1982.
   The amnesty application deadline is May 4, a date that has
confused some migrants, the Washington County grower said. Some
workers arrived early because they believed they could not cross
the border next month.
   ``Right now the (strawberry) crop looks very good, but it's
still too early to say,'' said the grower, who is providing hoeing
work for 15 to 20 people.
   ``I think everyone in Mexico now understands how the rules work.
... They say they're going to stay here: `We're going to wait for
the work.' I think they all realize that this is the last
opportunity to harvest in the Northwest.''

   Arab hijackers of a Kuwait Airways jumbo jet
overlooked the U.S. driver's license of an Egyptian-American, who
said he feared being harmed if his captors knew of his American
citizenship.
   On Thursday, more than 2,000 Kuwaitis attended the funeral of
two countrymen killed by the hijackers. Many of the mourners said
their country should never give in to the sky pirates' demands that
17 convicted terrorists imprisoned in Kuwait be released.
   Ramadan Ali, a consulting engineer who travels widely and holds
both Egyptian and United States citizenship, said he hid his U.S.
passport in his briefcase and showed only his Egyptian documents.
   ``One of them searched my wallet, and there was my (U.S.)
driver's license,'' Ali said during an interview at the home of a
relative in Kuwait. ``I was so lucky. He didn't realize what it
was.''
   He declined to give his American address because ``these guys,
they have long hands.''
   Ali was one of 12 passengers freed Tuesday night shortly before
the hijackers of the Boeing 747 flew from Cyprus to Algeria with
more than 30 passengers and crew still aboard. The Kuwait Airways
plane was seized April 5 on a flight from Bangkok.
   Ali, who displayed bruises on his wrists, said the hijackers put
plastic handcuffs on the passengers while the plane was in Mashhad,
Iran, where it first landed last week.
   His eight days as a hostage left him nervous, emotionally
stunned and wary of flying, Ali said.
   ``It became to me like a phobia,'' he said. ``It could happen
again.''
   Ali said the hijackers asked the branch of Islam he belonged to:
Sunni or Shiite.
   All of Kuwaitis released so far have been Shiites, members of
the branch that predominates in Iran and southern Lebanon, but is a
minority in the Islamic world.
   ``I was reading the Koran all the time. They noticed I'm a
religious person,'' he said, speculating that might have helped his
release.
   On Thursday, a military honor guard escorted the flag-draped
bodies of Khalid Ayyub Bandar, 20, and Abdullah Shibib al-Khalidi,
24, into a graveyard in Kuwait.
   The two men were beaten, shot and their bodies dumped on the
tarmac at the Larnaca, Cyprus airport, where the plane sat for five
days.
   Kuwait's crown prince, Sheik Saad Abdullah Al-Sabah, led the
procession of mourners along a condolence line of more than 60 male
relatives of the slain men.
   ``Even if they kill all the hostages there on the plane, we'll
never, ever release the killers who are here in Kuwait,'' said one
mourner, Faisal al-Marzouk, chief editor of Al-Anbaa newspaper.
   Like him, many of the mourners supported Kuwait's refusal to
free the 17 pro-Iranian terrorists who were convicted in a series
of bombings in December 1983 at the U.S. and French embassies in
Kuwait.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Fall In Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both the U.S. dollar and stock prices closed the
week sharply lower in Tokyo today following the announcement of
worse-than-expected U.S. trade figures for February.
   The dollar closed at 124.13 yen, down 2.02 yen from its close on
Thursday, but up slightly from its 123.95-yen opening level. During
the day, it ranged between 123.90 and 124.22 yen in moderate
trading.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's fall to the $13.8 billion U.S.
trade deficit in February, announced by the Commerce Department in
Washington on Thursday.
   ``The larger-than-expected U.S. trade deficit prompted the
dollar-selling in early trading, but the currency stabilized after
reports of intervention by the Bank of Japan and due to
profit-taking by export-related industries,'' said a trader at a
major commercial bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Kazuma Takasugi of the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar had
remained fairly stable during the day because participants were
nervous about possible additional intervention by the Bank of Japan.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which closed at a record 27,111.35 points
Thursday, lost 217.78 points to end the day at 26,893.57. The
decline came after four consecutive days of record highs for the
Nikkei index.
   ``The overnight setback on Wall Street and the weaker dollar,
coupled with profit taking, brought share prices sharply lower
during early trading,'' said Taketomi Kikuchi of Sanyo Securites.
   ``Toward the end of trading, share prices eased mainly because
of a wait-and-see attitude toward the dollar and the coming
weekend,'' he said.
   Kikuchi said trading was calm, with no concern among
participants that the market had risen too far.
   Among the losers were export-related issues, such as electricals
and precision machineries. Some large-capital issues also moved
lower.
   Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 1 billion
shares, down from 1.2 billion shares Thursday. Declining issues
outpaced advancers by 674 to 260, while 127 were unchanged.

<HEAD>World's Largest Toad Dies of `Biological Accident'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 5-pound, 1{-ounce South American toad
recognized as the world's largest has died apparently of old age,
but zoo officials said they're not sure just how old she was.
   ``She was not obese, just a very healthy specimen,'' Blank Park
Zoo director David Allen said Thursday of Toad A, known as ``Toad''
to her keepers.
   Terming the death a ``biological accident,'' Allen said
pathology tests are being conducted on Toad A to confirm the cause
of her April 8 death.
   Toad A, stretching to 9{ inches, was accepted late last year
into the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest toad on
Earth.
   A Miami animal dealer sold the South American toad to the zoo in
1983. At that time she was estimated to be 2 years old, Allen said,
but zoo keepers believe she may have been older than 8 when she
died.
   ``Toad's notoriety was an attraction for the zoo and we're very
disappointed at the loss,'' Allen said. ``A lot of people planned
on seeing Toad on exhibit at the zoo this summer.''
   Many may still get a chance.
   Toad A might be freeze-dried so she can be displayed, zoo
officials said.

   Spring snow blanketed mountains in Southern California today
while April showers dampened their lower elevations, but fair skies
prevailed across much of the rest of the nation.
   A winter storm warning for up to 7 to 14 inches of snow at the
higher reaches of Southern California's mountains was in effect
today, with up to 2 inches of rain for the lower reaches, and up to
an inch of rain on the coast.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms ranged over west Texas, and a
wave of cold air brought showers and scattered, light snow to the
upper Great Lakes and showers to the mid- and northern Atlantic
Coast.
   There were also scattered showers over Tennessee and southern
Missouri.
   Freezing temperatures prevailed early today from North Dakota
and eastern South Dakota to Michigan, and a freeze advisory was
posted for central and northwestern Indiana.
   Today's national weather forecast called for rain scattered from
the upper Ohio Valley into New England, with scattered snow across
eastern upper Michigan and northeast lower Michigan from northeast
Ohio through northwest Pennsylvania, into parts of western New York
state; showers and a few thunderstorms over the southern valleys of
California into the southern inter-mountain region.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 50s or 60s across
much of the nation; in the 40s from the upper Great Lakes into the
Ohio Valley and New England; in the 30s over Michigan and the
shores of the eastern Great Lakes; in the 70s across the Rockies,
western Texas and southern Oklahoma into the south-eastern states
and much of Florida; in the low to mid 80s across southern and
southeast Texas into the central Gulf Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 23
degrees at Marquette, Mich., and Warroad, Minn., to 73 degrees at
Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>`Mail,' A New Musical, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS four grafs with other critics; No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Mail'' is a little musical out of place on a
big Broadway stage.
   The show, which opened Thursday at the Music Box Theater,
examines the anxieties of a sensitive, 29-year-old, would-be
novelist named Alex who is having a mid-life crisis 10 years too
soon.
   Not exactly a novel idea for a musical, but for much of the
time, the evening is fun in an obvious, good-natured sort of way.
Seekers of Sondheim significance and solemnity should look
elsewhere.
   The problem with ``Mail'' is that the production relies on a
gimmick to keep the story going, and that gimmick falters during
the second act, no matter how busy director Andrew Cardiff keeps
his actors and set designers.
   The hook, created by author Jerry Colker, is simple. An
angst-ridden Alex (Michael Rupert) disappears for four months, and
when he returns to his dingy New York apartment, there is a pile of
mail to open. When he does, the letters leap to life.
   So does the complicated set, designed by Gerry Hariton and Vicki
Baral. Alex's letter writers jump out from behind doors, walls and
windows and pop out of the desk and bathtub. One even makes an
entrance through the refrigerator.
   There's his bewildered girlfriend Dana, dumped just when she and
Alex were going to get married, and Franklin, Alex's best friend,
an idealist turned entrepreneur.
   Other correspondents include Alex's gruff, obnoxious father who
wants his son to come back to the carburetor business in Mineola,
Long Island, and the writer's vixenish literary agent who wants to
get her client into bed before she gets him on the best-seller list.
   Their increasingly frantic missives are interrupted by overdue
bills, junk mail, high school reunion letters and even sweepstakes
announcements that sing and dance. These interludes are among the
best in the show. It's hard not to laugh when a contingent of Con
Edison workers, dressed in hard hats, T-shirts and short pants,
bully Alex in time to a disco ditty called ``We're Gonna Turn Off
Your Juice.''
   Colker also wrote the lyrics for ``Mail,'' and Rupert supplied
the music. With this large score _ nearly 30 numbers in all _ the
duo makes good on the promise they demonstrated in ``3 Guys Naked
From the Waist Down,'' an off-beat contemporary musical about the
world of stand-up comics.
   Rupert's music for ``Mail'' is eclectic, ranging from pop to
soul to ragtime to country-western. The songs have a brash Broadway
sound, the result of Michael Gibson's first-rate orchestrations. At
least one number, a lament by the rejected girlfriend entitled,
``It's Getting Harder to Love You,'' would seem to have potential
for a life outside of the show.
   Colker's amusing lyrics are more enticing than his slender
story. The tale starts to evaporate at the beginning of Act 2 when
Alex has a momentous revelation. He decides to see others as they
see him. That decision forces the letter writers to recapitulate
their feelings about our hero. It's only a matter of time before
Alex neatly resolves his problems with each of them and with
himself.
   Fortunately, the show has been blessed with a fine cast. Rupert
is a consumate, hard-working musical comedy performer and he makes
Alex an ingratiating character we can care about.
   Mara Getz as the lovesick Dana possesses the show's best voice
while Brian Mitchell, the opportunistic best friend, struts and
swings with style. Only Robert Mandan as the insensitive father
with problems of his own seems uncomfortable in the musical.
   The show always seems to be in motion, even when the story
isn't. Most of the recent Broadway musicals move, but they don't
dance. Grover Dale has come up with some snappy if abbreviated
dance routines recalling a style of musical comedy choreography
that has gone out of fashion.
   ``Mail'' makes for a reasonably diverting entertainment,
especially if you don't think too hard about the well-worn message
it delivers.
   In other reviews:
   Howard Kissel of the Daily News writes: ``This is a revue sketch
idea that might have been amusing for 12 minutes. ... the music is
as facile and vapid as the characters who sing it. ...
   ``But maybe someone should point out to young American writers
that the world has many more appealing subjects than their not very
interesting lives.''
   In The New York Times, Frank Rich asks: ``Is it possible that
`Mail' is a surreptitious advertisement for Federal Express?''

<TEXT>
   The Mexican government rejected as meddling
in its domestic affairs a U.S. Senate vote revoking President
Reagan's certification that Mexico was doing its part to combat
drug trafficking.
   The Senate approved a resolution Thursday that also would slap
trade and economic aid sanctions against Mexico. But the measure
stands little chance of passage in the U.S. House of
Representatives and is almost certain to be vetoed by Reagan.
   In a brief statement Thursday night, Mexico's Foreign Ministry
rejected the U.S. action as ``foreign interference'' in Mexican
affairs.
   ``No power can claim for itself the right to certify the conduct
of other societies or governments. No one has the right to impose
from abroad conduct, ideas, political or economic systems on other
peoples,'' the statement said.
   Under U.S. law, Mexico would stand to lose American support in
international lending institutions for new loans to the country if
the resolution became binding.
   The federal attorney general's office, which is responsible for
overseeing Mexico's narcotics efforts to find and destroy drugs,
issued its own strongly-worded statement late Thursday night
insisting that ``Mexico is undertaking a plain effort of
international cooperation in the campaign against drug
trafficking.''
   It expressed ``profound astonishment and its great displeasure
with the resolution taken by the United States Senate, in that (the
Senate) does not recognize the enormous effort of the Mexican
people to combat a problem whose causes are not, certainly,
attributable to Mexico.''
   The statement cited ``the vast consumer market'' for drugs, in a
clear reference to U.S. demand, as sustaining the illicit narcotics
trade.
   Mexico receives little economic aid from the United States. But
officials here are concerned about a requirement under 1986 law
that U.S. representatives in multilateral lending institutions must
vote against future loans to countries whose certification is
revoked.
   Mexico has a $105 billion foreign debt, and depends heavily on
its relationship with foreign lenders.
   Officials point out that about one-quarter of Mexico's
100,000-member armed forces is permanently assigned to narcotics
interdiction and eradication operations.
   Mexican officials also have insisted they could use more
financial assistance from the United States in fighting drugs. As
recently as 1986, U.S. anti-drug assistance to Mexico was about
half that provided for eliminating the screwworm in Mexican cattle.
   More than 100 army troops and federal judicial policemen have
been killed over the past 10 years during drug operations,
according to Mexican army figures.
   Relations between the two countries have been soured by mutual
accusations surrounding the Feb. 7, 1985 kidnapping of U.S. Drug
Enforcement agent Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   The bodies of Camarena and Alfredo Zavala Avelar, a Mexican
pilot who worked with him in anti-narcotics programs from their
base in Guadalajara, were found on March 5, 1985.
   American officials charged that Mexican authorities were slow in
seeking out and arresting several drug barons who allegedly ordered
the killings.
   Attorney General Sergio Garcia Ramirez has called for an end to
mutual recriminations between Mexico and the United States over
their contributions to the fight against the drug trade.
   ``We find it difficult to accept the opinion held in the United
States of what really goes on in Mexico,'' Garcia Ramirez said.
``The border is not a border between black and white, good and
evil. It is a border between countries.''

<HEAD>Late Porn Star Confessed To Role In Slayings, Ex-Wife Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pornographic film star John Holmes tearfully
confessed to a role in the bludgeoning deaths of four people,
charges he was acquitted of in 1982, his ex-wife said.
   Holmes, who died last month of complications stemming from AIDS,
told his ex-wife, Sharon Holmes, that he led three killers to a
hillside home and stood by while they murdered four people, the Los
Angeles Times reported in Thursday's editions.
   Ms. Holmes, who divorced the actor in 1984, said in a recent
interview with the newspaper that Holmes confessed his role to her
shortly after the slayings in July 1981.
   However, he said he didn't participate in the murders and never
told her the names of the killers, she said.
   Another woman who had a longtime intimate relationship with
Holmes and asked not to be identified said he made a similar
admission to her, the newspaper said. She reported that admission
to police in 1981.
   Together, the women's stories corroborate the Los Angeles Police
Department's theory of how the killings happened.
   Holmes, who died March 13 at age 43, was tried and acquitted in
a 1982 trial. No one but Holmes has ever been charged in the murder
of Ronald Launius, 37; William DeVerell, 42; Joy Audrey Miller, 46;
and Barbara Richardson, 22.
   The actor appeared in hundreds of sexually explicit films in the
1970s and early '80s, when he was the porn industry's leading male
star.

   Nancy Reagan made her last appearance as first
lady before an anti-drug group's conference, telling students,
youth leaders and teachers she will be with them ``in spirit''
after her husband leaves office in January.
   ``These past eight years of work against drugs have brought new
meaning to my life, and I will not abandon what we are
accomplishing,'' Mrs. Reagan said Thursday in remarks to the PRIDE
International Conference on Youth and Drugs.
   Mrs. Reagan, making her fifth annual appearence, drew frequent
cheers from the crowd of 3,000 amid a pep-rally atmosphere. The
conference was the 11th sponsored by the Parents' Resource
Institute for Drug Education.
   The first lady told the young people that they pose ``a threat
to the dealers and the traffickers ... a danger to the drug
attitudes that have ruled this country for the past two decades.''
   ``It's the young people who will solve the drug crisis in this
country,'' she said. ``We could have parents following their
children's every move. We could have drug agents on every corner,
treatment centers on every block, jails in every neighborhood, and
still there would be a demand for drugs.
   ``What will win the battle against drugs is a change in
attitudes, and that's exactly what you're accomplishing,'' she
said. ``While I won't be able to come here every year as I have in
the past, I'll be with you in spirit.''
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III also spoke to the group
Thursday.

<HEAD>Senate Votes Sanctions on Mexico for Drug War Failings</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Moves penultimate graf pvs, bgng: ``Under a ...'' up to 5th
graf to raise description of sanctions.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators voted overwhelmingly to impose aid
sanctions on Mexico for its shortcomings in the war on drugs,
ignoring warnings that the move would damage relations with the
United States' third-largest trading partner.
   ``This may be just the signal Mexico needs to wake up before it
is too late,'' said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., a leader of the
effort to slap penalties on drug-producing and transit countries
that fall short in their enforcement efforts.
   But in Mexico City, the Foreign Ministry released a statement
condemning the Senate vote as ``foreign interference.''
   In voting 63-27 Thursday for the sanctions, the Senate ignored
vehement Mexican objections and a plea from President Reagan, who
had certified six weeks ago that the government there was ``fully
cooperating'' with the U.S. war on drugs and should receive all its
normal U.S. aid and trade benefits.
   Under a 1986 anti-drug law, countries identified as production
or transit points for illegal drugs must lose half their U.S.
foreign aid and certain trade and lending rights unless the
president certifies that they are ``fully cooperating'' with the
war on drugs.
   Reagan, in a letter to Senate leaders, warned that the impact of
the decertification bill ``would almost certainly be an increase in
the flow of drugs to the United States'' because it would insult
Mexico and make the government less inclined to cooperate.
   In separate action, the Senate voted 54-40 not to impose similar
sanctions on the Bahamas, and approved a resolution adding Haiti to
the list of international drug producing and shipment points that
are subject to close scrutiny and possible aid sanctions if their
drug enforcement programs don't measure up.
   Legislation to slap aid sanctions on Mexico and four other Latin
American countries also is pending in the House, which would have
to approve the Mexico resolution before it could become law. Even
supporters of the bill conceded the measure has little likelihood
of clearing all the hurdles, but said the symbolic value of the
Senate vote was enough.
   ``It's all rather academic,'' said Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.,
the bill's primary sponsor. ``But by adopting this resolution, we
will be sending a message to the government of Mexico.''
   The Mexican government said the United States has no business
sending that kind of a message.
   ``No power can claim for itself the right to certify the conduct
of other societies or governments. No one has the right to impose
from abroad conduct, ideas, political or economic systems on other
peoples,'' the Foreign Ministry statement said.
   However, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said close to 40
percent of the cocaine that enters the United States comes through
Mexico, making the 1,900-mile border between the two countries the
No. 1 entry point for narcotics.
   ``We've got to take off the gloves,'' he said.
   Despite the remoteness of chances any real sanctions could be
enacted, Mexico fought hard against the measure and was threatening
privately to kick U.S. drug enforcement personnel out of the
country and tackle enforcement without outside help.
   Congressional aides familiar with the issue said Mexico feared
that any no-confidence vote from Congress could erode its world
standing and potentially harm the willingness of international
business to invest in the cash-starved country.
   To complaints that Mexico would be offended by the bill, D'Amato
said: ``It's about time we told them they should be offended,
because we're offended.'' Citing increased drug-related violence in
his home state, he added, ``It's not about business as usual at the
State Department.''
   But during a five-hour Senate floor debate, opponents suggested
that lawmakers were pushing for the sanctions at least in part
because of election-year pressure to strike a blow against drug
trafficking.
   Noting the comments of D'Amato and Wilson, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., suggested the United States itself falls short of the
standards they seek to apply to Mexico. McCain said ``marijuana is
California's largest cash crop'' and said New York streets are
unsafe because of drug-related crime.
   ``I wonder if we shouldn't decertify those states'' and cut off
federal aid, McCain asked.
   Of particular concern to Mexico was a requirement that if
certification is lost, U.S. representatives to international
development banks must vote against future loans to the affected
country. The United States has a weighted vote at the banks, but
not a majority. Loans from the banks have been crucial to Mexico,
which is laboring under a mammoth foreign debt.

<HEAD>Deposed Governor Could Be Delegate to GOP Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham says his political
career isn't necessarily over and that he could become a delegate
to the Republican National Convention in August.
   The former Republican governor, removed from office by
impeachment conviction on April 4, will be on the ballot in the
first step of the delegate-selection process in his district caucus
on Wednesday.
   Asked Thursday if he planned to seek a spot as a GOP convention
delegate, Mecham said, ``Oh yes,'' but he did not elaborate. There
have been reports that Mecham would seek to become a delegate for
GOP candidate Pat Robertson, who has put his campaign on hold.
   ``He (Mecham) is a bona fide precinct committeeman'' and thus is
among 175 people who will be on the ballot when his legislative
district chooses 38 delegates and 38 alternates to the state
Republican convention on May 14, said Mecham's district GOP
chairman, Joe Allman.
   The state Republican convention will choose the delegates to the
national convention in New Orleans Aug. 15-18. Other delegates will
be chosen at state GOP mini-caucuses.
   Meanwhile, the Arizona Senate Government Committee voted 5-4 on
Thursday to approve a bill to create a Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday.
   One of Mecham's first acts in office was to rescind a King
holiday declared by his Democratic predecessor, Gov. Bruce Babbitt,
and the resulting uproar dogged Mecham through his short term.
   The latest King holiday bill was virtually identical to the one
the Senate defeated along a party line last year. Republicans, who
control the Senate 19-11, will consider the measure next week in
caucus.

<TEXT>
   The movie ``Colors'' opens today in 425
theaters across the country amid protests by the Guardian Angels
and others who claim the street-gang drama will incite violence.
   But Dennis Hopper, the film's director, called the protesters
``irresponsible'' and said they were encouraging ``blood to flow in
the streets.''
   The movie stars Sean Penn and Robert Duvall as gang-fighting Los
Angeles policemen. The movie, which used active Los Angeles-area
gang members as extras and advisers, portrays the world of the
Crips and the Bloods, rival gangs, who use the colors blue and red,
respectively, to distinguish themselves.
   Some theaters planned to increase security today as the film
opened.
   In Chicago, police Supt. LeRoy Martin said extra police might be
assigned to patrol near theaters where ``Colors'' is playing. He
said the film might send a message that there is ``something clever
and hip about being a gang member.''
   Six Guardian Angels including Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the
volunteer crime-fighting group, were arrested Thursday on charges
of disorderly conduct when they tried to enter the New York City
office of the film's distributor, Orion Pictures.
   ``The movie ... glorifies street crack youth gangs,'' Sliwa
declared during a rally in front of the midtown Manhattan building.
The group had announced plans to ``take over'' the office.
   Sliwa said the film provides a virtual ``how-to'' of street
violence, including the killing of a police officer, and fosters
negative stereotypes by depicting minority youths as violent toughs.
   But Hopper said the protesters ``are whipping up the probability
and the possibility'' of violence. ``The people who are saying
blood is going to flow in the streets are asking for blood to flow
in the streets.''
   Charles O. Glenn, executive vice president of Orion Pictures,
said the movie is a statement of conscience and could ``shock''
children into avoiding drugs and violence.
   ``If there is anything this picture does not do _ it does not
glorify gangs or gang violence,'' Glenn said. ``We feel that
`Colors' is an honest and socially responsible portrayal of a
problem that obviously exists in Los Angeles and in the streets of
every other American city.''
   However, Wes McBride, president of the California Gang
Investigators Association, said ``Colors'' will ``leave dead bodies
from one end of this town to the other.''
   In Seattle, the local Guardian Angels group threatened to seek a
court injunction if Seattle theaters show ``Colors'' and said a
protest would begin tonight at the UA Cinema 150 in downtown
Seattle.
   ``Each one of us was horrified by what we saw on the screen,''
said Patti Whitehead, Guardian Angels chapter leader, after she and
others previewed the movie Wednesday night. ``The movie as we saw
it was a simple recruitment for gang members.''

   The dollar was mostly lower in thin late-morning
European trading today, even though apprehension about possible
central bank intervention was supporting the currency, traders said.
   Gold prices rose.
   Traders predicted little substantial change in the dollar before
the weekend, but warned that the dollar could come under heavy
pressure early next week.
   Dealers said the U.S. February trade deficit of $13.83 billion,
announced Thursday, had confirmed many traders' worst suspicions
about the long-term trend of the U.S. trade imbalance.
   The markets had expected January's $12.44 billion deficit to
improve.
   ``The only thing that will really cure the U.S. trade gap is a
recession and I don't see that happening in election year,'' said a
trader with a major U.S. commercial bank in Milan.
   Another Milan trader predicted the dollar will face heavy
selling pressure when the markets open on Monday.
   ``Traders had a busy day yesterday and are waiting for the
weekend,'' he said. ``The real war will begin on Monday.''
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar fell 2.02 yen to a closing 124.13. Later, in London, it was
quoted at 124.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.6645 West German marks, up from 1.6635
   _1.3743 Swiss francs, down from 1.3745
   _5.6458 French francs, up from 5.6390
   _1.8673 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8680
   _1,234.85 Italian lire, down from 1,244
   _1.2330 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2368
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8817, compared
with $1.8755 Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $452.90 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $451. At midmorning Friday, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$453.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price was also $453.85, up from $450.50 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $5.45 to close at a bid $454.93.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.48 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday $6.43.

<TEXT>
   A 37-year-old dairy farmer was convicted
of three counts of first-degree murder in connection with the
slayings of seven members of his family, a rampage he at first
blamed on a 14-year-old victim.
   James E. Schnick of Elkland wept with his face buried in his
hands when the verdicts were read early Thursday night. The jury
deliberated about two hours after hearing 2{ days of testimony.
   The jury was scheduled to return this morning to receive
instructions for the sentencing phase of the trial. The jury must
recommend either the death penalty or life in prison without
probation or parole.
   Schnick was convicted in the deaths of his wife, Julie, and two
nephews, 14-year-old Kirk Buckner and 2-year-old Michael Buckner.
   He also was accused, but not tried, in the deaths of his
brother-in-law, Steve Buckner; Buckner's wife, Jeannette, and the
Buckners' other sons, Dennis, 8, and Timmy, 6. Buckner and Mrs.
Schnick were brother and sister.
   Darlene Beisiegel, the mother of Mrs. Buckner, said one question
remained unanswered for her.
   ``I just wanted to know why he did it,'' she said. ``I think it
was cold-blooded.''
   All the victims were killed Sept. 25 in an early-morning
shooting spree at two dairy farms in nearby Elkland.
   Schnick originally blamed the slayings on his nephew Kirk, a
revelation that shocked members of the community who knew the
teen-ager. Within days, however, Schnick himself was charged in
connection with the seven deaths.
   Investigators discovered, among other inconsistencies, that Kirk
Buckner was left-handed. The .22-caliber revolver used in the
killings was found in Kirk's right hand.

   Singer Dennis Day has returned home
after spending five weeks at a hospital for treatment of a head
injury following a fall at his home, a spokeswoman said.
   Day, a mainstay on Jack Benny's radio and television shows, was
released from St. John's Hospital and Health Center Wednesday
night, and is ``home with nurses and all the necessary trappings,''
said his publicist, Kitty Davis.
   ``He is alert and conscious but he's having therapy,'' Ms. Davis
said Thursday. ``The main therapy is that he's home with his
family.''
   Doctors determined last summer that Day, 71, was suffering from
amyotropic lateral sclerosis, a progressive nerve disorder also
known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
   On March 9, Day fell at his Bel Air-area home, and complained of
a severe headache immediately afterward. A diagnosis showed
bleeding in the brain and Day underwent emergency surgery.
   Day, born Eugene Denis McNulty in New York City, began his
career with Jack Benny in 1939. In addition to singing, he often
played a dim-witted straight man in comic dialogues with Benny.

   Six Irishmen serving life sentences for the worst
terrorist attack in modern British history failed to win permission
to appeal their convictions before Britain's highest court.
   The defendants, known as the Birmingham Six, claimed they were
beaten into confessing and were wrongly convicted on faulty
forensic evidence for two Irish Republican Army pub bombings that
killed 21 people and injured 162 in the central England city of
Birmingham in 1974.
   The three Law Lords of the House of Lords, members of the
unelected upper legislative chamber who have expertise as judges,
rejected the men's bid to challenge their murder convictions
Thursday. They did not give reasons for their decision.
   The men's only option now would be to take their case to the
European Court of Human Rights.
   ``At some stage a future Home Secretary is going to have to deal
with the ongoing injustice to these men,'' said Gareth Pierce, a
lawyer for the six. The Home Secretary is the Cabinet minister
responsible for the administration of law and order.
   ``They simply can't spend the rest of their lives in prison when
they have committed no offense,'' Pierce said.
   The men were not present at the 90-minute preliminary hearing at
which the Law Lords were deciding whether to hear the case in full.
   In January, after a five-week court battle, the Court of Appeal
upheld their convictions and sent them back to prison.
   The Irish government believes the six may have been convicted
wrongly. The failure of the appeal in January contributed to a
severe strain in Anglo-Irish relations.
   The bombs exploded minutes apart at two pubs in Birmingham on
Nov. 21, 1974. Within hours, the six were rounded up among dozens
of suspects.
   Four signed confessions and two were said to have made verbal
admissions.
   In 1975, a court imposed multiple life sentences on Patrick
Hill, Hugh Callaghan, John Walker, Richard McIlkenny, Gerry Hunter
and William Power. Three of the men are in their 50s and three in
their 40s.
   The IRA, fighting British rule in Northern Ireland, claimed
responsibility for the bombings but said none of the six was
involved.
   The almost exclusively Catholic Irish Republican Army wants to
join the Protestant-dominated province and set up an all-Ireland
socialist state.

<HEAD>Sandinista, Contra Commissions End Technical Talks, Report
Progress</HEAD>

   Sandinista and Contra commissions
charged with defining Nicaragua's cease-fire finished talks early
today with both sides reporting progress.
   High-level government and rebel leaders, meanwhile, planned to
meet later today in the capital of Managua for the first time to
further negotiations toward lasting peace.
   The Sandinista and Contra commissions, meeting in Sapoa on the
Costa Rican border, said they achieved ``considerable progress''
and ``reconciled differences of the earlier meeting,'' according to
an official statement issued by both sides.
   They remaining differences were not known, but both sides said
they would take them up in the high-level meeting today.
   The two sides held six technical meetings since March 28 and
managed only to agree on seven zones in which the Contra combatants
are to gather. They failed to define operating conditions within
the areas affecting security and resupply.
   The zones and the technical talks were outlined in the March 23
cease-fire pact signed by the Soviet-supplied Sandinistas and the
U.S.-backed Contras after three days of unprecedented direct
negotiations at the Sapoa border post, 90 miles south of the
capital.
   The goal is to end more than six years of war that have killed
more than 40,000 Nicaraguans.
   The commissions were defining the mechanics of the cease-fire,
which formally went into effect April 1.
   Under the plan, the Contra evacuation into the zones was to have
been completed by today. In return, the Sandinistas were to have
released 700 political prisoners, allowed humanitarian aid for the
rebels and permitted the insurgents to send representatives to take
part in internal political discussions.
   Two points contained in a Contra proposal had been termed
``non-negotiable'' by the Sandinistas. It would allow the
combatants to receive replacements of arms and ammunition inside
the zones while prohibiting the government from accepting military
aid, which comes from the Soviet bloc.
   The cease-fire pact allows only humanitarian aid to be
distributed by a neutral organization to the rebels. It does not
mention government supplies.
   The Contra delegation was to be headed by its Miami-based
directorate, made up of Adolfo Calero, Aristides Sanchez, Alfredo
Cesar, Maria Azucena Ferrey and Pedro Joaquin Chamorro.
   The government's delegation is headed by the nation's highest
military leader, Gen. Humberto Ortega, the brother of President
Daniel Ortega.
   Agreement is needed on a new deadline for the Contras to gather
into zones and for the Sandinistas to make their concessions, such
as the prisoner release. The pact now calls for a 60-day
cease-fire, which ends June 1.
   The Sandinistas and Contras still stand far apart on the issue
of laying down weapons, which is not mentioned in the cease-fire
plan. They do agree the rebel combatants can enter the zones with
their weapons.
   The Contras argue that they will never put down their arms until
Nicaragua is ``on the irreversible road to democracy.'' The
Sandinistas contend that disarmament must occur before
reintegration into civilian life.

   Tobias F. Schaeffer, known as a colleague
by the National Association of Real Estate Appraisers, is actually
Roy Schaeffer's 8-year-old cat Toby.
   ``I just wanted to prove that this organization doesn't screen
applicants,'' said Schaeffer, a Warwick real estate appraiser.
   But the association, which didn't like the idea of having a cat
for a colleague, has filed a $1 million lawsuit against Schaeffer,
the human, for registering Schaeffer, the feline.
   ``We feel he's hurt our organization by getting out there and
saying, `Hey, they had a cat as a member,''' director E. Kenneth
Twichell said Wednesday. ``Yes, we've had a cat as a member but
somebody defrauded us.''
   When a bank or savings and loan wants to hire an appraiser,
``they'll say, `Maybe it's a cat,''' Twichell said. The
16,000-member association is based in Scottsdale, Ariz. The suit
was filed in federal court in Phoenix.
   Schaeffer, after answering a direct-mail advertisement and
obtaining an application, signed Toby up two years ago to show
others in his office how simple it was to get an appraiser's
certificate from the association.
   He changed his cat's name to Tobias, gave it a middle initial _
F for Feline _ and sent in an $85 check. In return, the cat
received a gold-embossed appraiser's certificate, was listed in the
group's directory for 1986 and received a membership sticker.
   Twichell said certifiates are granted without screening because
the association does not expect experienced professionals to lie.

   A gas explosion ripped through a
five-story apartment building in Cologne today and injured 17
people, three of them seriously, police said.
   The blast was in the Ehrenfeld district of the Rhine River city
shortly before 8 a.m., and there was ``extreme danger'' of the
structure collapsing, a police spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   Authorities feared some people may be buried in the rubble.
Rescue work at the site continued in the afternoon, they said.
   According to the spokesman, the blast left residents of at least
20 apartments homeless. The spokesman did not immediately say how
many people lived in the building.
   Police said the explosion may have been touched off by
construction work on a nearby subway system, and a local resident
complained of smelling gas shortly before the blast occurred.

   Ethiopia said international relief
agencies it expelled were helping separatist rebels in the
drought-stricken north and that its own government relief program
could handle the crisis.
   But Western officials said the Soviet-backed government alone
will not be able to feed the millions threatened with starvation.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
United States would consult with the Soviet Union about urging
Ethiopia to allow food aid to resume.
   Last week the Marxist government ordered the expulsion of all
foreign aid workers from the northern provinces of Eritrea and
Tigre and said the situation was too dangerous for foreign relief
personnel.
   But an editorial by the state-run Ethiopia News Agency,
published on the front page of the Ethiopian Herald, said Thursday
that the International Committee of the Red Cross and other
agencies were aiding insurgents.
   The editorial accused unidentified relief agencies of committing
``serious crimes by transmitting false information to the world
about the drought situation ... through sophisticated communication
facilities which they had installed purportedly to ease relief
operations.''
   ``The International Committee of the Red Cross is at the
forefront of these, which have been directly or indirectly
supporting separatist bandits,'' it said.
   Rebels in Eritrea have been battling the government for 27 years
in Africa's longest civil war. In neighboring Tigre, rebels have
been fighting for 14 years.
   A special U.N. envoy arrived in Addis Ababa on Wednesday to
discuss the expulsions with government officials. About 60 Western
relief workers were ordered out of northern Ethiopia last week.
   A spokesman for the Geneva-based organization, Vincent Bernard,
refused comment.
   The United Nations also refused immediate comment. It had been
coordinating the huge northern relief operation that relies on food
from Western donors.
   Western aid officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have
said they fear the government expelled relief workers to remove
witnesses from the war zone as it prepares for a major offensive
against the rebels.
   On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department accused the Marxist
government of sacrificing the interests of millions of its citizens
in pursuit of military objectives. Ethiopia denied the charge.
   An estimated 3.2 million people are facing starvation in the
northern regions.
   Until peace comes, all relief operations must be handled by the
government Relief and Rehabilitation Commission and other national
organizations, the editorial said.
   ``Refusal to go along with such (an) arrangement is tantamount
to interfering in our domestic affairs,'' it concluded.
   Berhanu Jembere, the chief Ethiopian relief official, has said
Western aid workers would be allowed back in the north only when
the area had been ``cleansed of bandits.''
   The government says it will be able to feed most northern
drought victims with help from Ethiopian organizations. But Berhanu
said the war effort took priority over relief operations and that
there could be a ``temporary stoppage'' of food distribution in
areas outside government control. Rebels now control most of Tigre
and much of Eritrea.
   Western relief officials say that at most 1 million people could
be fed from government-held distribution sites. They fear mass
migration of the hungry and have warned that deaths from starvation
could begin within weeks.

   President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines met
with Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun today after
receiving an official welcome on her first visit to China.
   In two hours of talks in the Great Hall of the People, Mrs.
Aquino and Li discussed Cambodia, Afghanistan, disarmament and
U.S.-Soviet relations, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Mrs. Aquino also stressed that ``we stick to the policy of
non-interference in each other's internal affairs.'' China has
assured Manila that it no longer aids communist insurgents in the
Philippines. Mrs. Aquino said that the People's Republic is the
sole legal government representing China.
   It was not known whether the two spoke about trade issues. The
Philippines has sought a reduction in China's surplus in trade
between the two countries.
   Li, who was formally confirmed as premier at the just-concluded
session of China's legislature, the National People's Congress,
greeted Mrs. Aquino in English and said: ``Glad to meet you.
Welcome to Peking.''
   Yang noted that Chinese-Philippine contacts date back for
centuries and that ``the Chinese and Filipinos are relatives as
well as friends. We hope more and more Philippine friends will
visit China,'' Xinhua reported.
   The ancestors of Mrs. Aquino, like those of many Filipinos, came
from China. On her first day in China Thursday, Mrs. Aquino visited
the home of maternal great-grandfather in southern Fujian province.
   Mrs. Aquino said the warm reception she received in the village
of Hongjian ``was a reflection of the friendly feelings of the
Chinese people for the Philippine people.''
   Li and Yang accepted an invitation from Mrs. Aquino to visit the
Philippines, Xinhua said. No date was set.
   Yang presided over welcoming ceremonies earlier outside the hall.
   The new president, an 81-year-old general, accompanied Mrs.
Aquino on a review of a People's Liberation Army honor guard and
300 children dancing and waving bouquets. She received a 21-gun
salute from cannons on Tiananmen Square.
   Mrs. Aquino and Li spoke about Cambodia. Both Asian nations
support the rebels in their 9-year-old war against Vietnamese
troops in Cambodia.
   Mrs. Aquino, accompanied by two of her daughters, planned an
afternoon visit to the Forbidden City, home in the past to the
Chinese imperial family, and the Great Wall.
   Her three-day trip to China is her first abroad since November
1986, and was called risky by opposition leaders because of fears
of a coup following the escape of renegade military officer
Gregorio Honasan, who led an attempted takeover last August.
   The military was put on full alert on the eve of the visit.
   Philippine presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said Thursday
that Honasan was not capable of mounting a serious threat to the
government.
   Mrs. Aquino was swept to power in February 1986 after a
civilian-military coup ousted President Ferdinand Marcos. Marcos
lives in exile in Hawaii.

<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded today at a U.S. Air Force
radio relay station near a U.S.-Spanish air base east of the
Spanish capital and caused slight damage but no injuries, a U.S.
Embassy spokesman said.
   The spokesman, Bob Meade, said the bombing took place about 6
a.m. (midnight Thursday EDT) when a bomb planted near an air
condition unit exploded at Humosa, a radio relay station about six
miles east of the U.S.-Spanish air base at Torrejon.
   Torrejon is 12 miles northeast of Madrid.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, Meade said, and
police gave no indication of what group could have carried it out.
   The Spanish national news agency EFE cited an unidentified
Defense Ministry source as saying the bomb attack on the U.S.
facility could be related to the second anniversary of the April
15, 1986, U.S. air raids on Libya.
   President Reagan ordered the air attack on Libya in retaliation
for alleged Libyan involvement in the bombing of a nightclub in
West Berlin that killed two U.S. servicemen and a Turkish woman.
   Meade said the explosion caused slight damage to a maintenance
building near the fenced perimeter of the station, but did not
interrupt U.S. Air Force communications at Torrejon, which the
station supports.
   Torrejon air base has served as the site of numerous protest
marches against U.S. bases and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization in recent years.
   In a March 1986 referendum called by the government of Socialist
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Spaniards overwhelmingly voted to
keep Spain in NATO on condition Spanish armed forces remain outside
the NATO command structure, that U.S. troops in Spain be
substantially reduced and that Spain remain free of nuclear weapons.
   Last Jan. 15, after 18 months of tough negotiations, the United
States accepted Spanish demands to withdraw within three years a
tactical wing of 72 F-16 fighter bombers from Torrejon to gain a
new eight-year defense accord to replace a five-year pact set to
expire May 14.
   The U.S. armed services currently maintains three air bases and
an important southern Atlantic Ocean naval station as well as
10,000 troops in Spain.
   Last Dec. 26, a bomb blast at a United Service Organizations bar
in the northeastern Mediterranean port of Barcelona killed one U.S.
sailor and injured nine others.
   The Red Army of Catalonian Liberation claimed responsibility for
the attack. The tiny, little-known terrorist group seeks
independence from Spain for the four-province northeastern region
of Catalonia.

   A man who won a court order to prevent his
18-year-old girlfriend from ending her pregnancy believes
``fanatics who hold abortion above the law'' persuaded her to have
the operation anyway, his attorney says.
   The would-be father will not seek a contempt citation against
the woman, but ``is concerned about the people who advised her.
They acted lawlessly,'' attorney James Bopp Jr. said Thursday.
   The woman's attorneys said she made the decision to have the
abortion.
   Bopp said he might try to find out who performed the abortion
and who advised the woman to have an abortion. Those people could
be targeted for further legal action, he said.
   Meanwhile, the appeal of the injunction in the case was assigned
Thursday to the Indiana Court of Appeals while the woman shunned
publicity.
   ``She would just like to disappear,'' said Terre Haute attorney
Samuel E. Beecher Jr., who represents the unmarried woman
identified in court documents as V.J.H.
   ``She's a very private person. She never imagined that she would
have had this publicity,'' said Beecher.
   The woman's attorneys said they cannot reveal when or where the
abortion was performed, but they said no one coerced the woman to
have an abortion.
   ``A whole lot went into her decision-making process, and those
are considerations of the utmost personal nature that don't have to
be brought out in court or the media and she didn't,'' said Richard
A. Waples of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union.
   The woman's attorneys announced on Wednesday that she had
undergone an abortion despite the permanent injunction granted
Monday in response to the request of a 24-year-old Terre Haute
delivery-truck driver who claimed to be the father of the unborn
child.
   Attorneys for both sides asked for an expedited appeal to the
state Supreme Court. On Thursday, the justices rejected that
request, noting that the case no longer is an emergency, and told
the Court of Appeals to consider the issue.
   The case hasn't yet been assigned to a three-judge panel in the
Court of Appeals, according to that court's administrative office.
   Because the case involves a paternity action, the names of the
man and the woman are not revealed in court documents. The woman's
attorneys dispute the man's claim to be the father.
   Attorneys for both sides argued that, despite the abortion, the
case isn't moot.
   Waples said the injunction issued by Vigo Circuit Judge Robert
H. Brown ``represents a fundamental assault on a women's right to
privacy.''
   ``If this order is allowed to go uncorrected, other judges might
be tempted to do the same,'' he said.
   Bopp said he wants a higher court ruling on whether a father's
rights should be weighed against the mother's in cases where an
abortion is in dispute.
   ``Unless we get this case on appeal and the Supreme Court
upholds the father's right, we could have other cases of a father
going to court and getting an injunction but the woman going ahead
and getting an abortion,'' said Bopp, who also represents the
national Right to Life organization based in Washington.

   Troops raided a suburban house today
and arrested 10 people, including eight navy guards who helped the
leader of an August coup attempt escape his prison ship this month,
the military said.
   Officials said troops had surrounded at least four other houses
believed to be hideouts of followers of former Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan.
   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, commander of the National Capital
Regional Defense Command, said there was a distinct possibility
Honasan might be in one of the houses.
   Honasan led the bloody Aug. 28 coup attempt but escaped April 2
with 14 of his elite navy guards. The charismatic former lieutenant
colonel had been detained on the navy ship since his arrest last
December in a Manila suburb.
   Biazon said three Marine companies and 30 police and soldiers
carried out the raid one day after a tip that renegade troops were
hiding in the Blue Ridge district of suburban Quezon City.
   The raid lasted only 15 minutes, he said, and there was no
resistance. Raiders seized 16 M-14 rifles, four M-16s, one light
machine gun, five Israeli-made Uzis, a grenade launcher and several
grenades.
   Those arrested included Lt. Eraldo Mojica, commander of the
security force aboard the ship from which Honasan escaped. Two of
those arrested were civilians, Biazon said.
   Col. Emiliano Templo, chief of staff of the Capital Regional
Command, said raids were continuing in hopes of capturing Honasan,
who has vowed to continue his struggle against President Corazon
Aquino.
   ``There are other places to be raided,'' Templo said. ``Maybe,
before the night is over, we will know if he (Honasan) is here or
not.''
   The raid took place as the military was on full alert to prevent
a new coup attempt while Mrs. Aquino paid a four-day visit to China
and Hong Kong. She left Thursday.
   Before the raids, the military announced the filing of the first
mutiny charges against officers linked to Honasan's failed coup.
   Military spokesman Lt. Anselmo Cabingan said those who have been
formally charged before a court martial include two lieutenant
colonels, a major and two lieutenants. Their arraignment has been
scheduled for Monday, he added.
   At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 others wounded
during the coup attempt.
   Military lawyers said more charges were to be filed soon against
more than 100 military officers and enlisted men jailed in
connection with the coup attempt, the most serious of half a dozen
bids to unseat Mrs. Aquino since she came to power in February 1986.
   Also today, police clashed with stone-throwing leftists near the
U.S. Embassy and blocked a nearby march by militant Moslems
protesting the U.S. bombing raids on Libya two years ago.
   Two demonstrators and one policeman were injured in the melee,
the second near the embassy in two weeks. The clash broke out when
club-swinging riot police charged a group of about 120 students who
had arrived at a square fronting the embassy, witnesses said.
   They said three of the demonstrators who threw stones at police
were arrested.
   At about the same time 100 yards away, police blocked a march by
about 350 Filipino Moslems who were heading for the embassy on a
march marking the second anniversary of U.S. bombing raids on Libya
in 1986.
   The Moslems dispersed peacefully after a brief rally at an
intersection where they chanted anti-American slogans. They also
burned the U.S., British and Israeli flags as well as an effigy of
President Reagan.
   Leaflets distributed during the rally said the April 15, 1986,
raids on the Libyan cities of Benghazi and Tripoli unmasked the
United States as ``20th century barbarians.''
   The U.S. bombings came 10 days after a terrorist bomb killed two
American soldiers and a Turkish woman and injured more than 200
people at a disco in West Berlin. Libyan officials said 37 people
were killed in the raids.

   Sandi Patti has been voted the top
female gospel music singer for the seventh straight year and has
earned her fifth award as Christian music's No. 1 artist.
   Miss Patti won three Dove Awards Thursday night from the Gospel
Music Association, sharing honors with Larnelle Harris who was
voted male vocalist of the year and two other accolades.
   Miss Patti, of Anderson, Ind., also won an award for co-writing
``In the Name of the Lord,'' which was voted song of the year. Her
co-writers were Phil McHugh and Gloria Gaither, wife of gospel
music pioneer Bill Gaither.
   Miss Patti, who gave birth to twins in November, had cut back on
her appearances and recording work last year.
   ``I didn't work a whole lot,'' she said after the 19th annual
presentations at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center.
   She also won the award as top artist in 1982, 1984, 1985 and
1987.
   Harris, of Louisville, Ky., earned male vocalist of the year for
the third time, top inspirational album for ``The Father Hath
Provided'' and best songwriter.
   ``It has been a great year,'' said Harris, who won his fourth
Grammy Award in February.
   Harris also was voted top male vocalist in 1983 and 1986.
   Soul music star Aretha Franklin was honored for the best
traditional black album of the year for ``One Lord, One Faith, One
Baptism.'' She was not present at the ceremony.
   Cliff Barrows, veteran music director for the Billy Graham
Crusade, was chosen for induction into the Gospel Music Hall of
Fame. He also was not present.
   The Winans, a brother-and-sister duet from Detroit, were double
winners, earning No. 1 contemporary black gospel album for
``Decisions'' and the Horizon Award as the top rising act.
   First Call, a Nashville trio, was voted group of the year for
the second straight time.
   Gospel superstar Amy Grant, whose music has crossed over into
the pop field, won best short form video of the year for ``Stay For
A While.'' It was the only category in which she was a finalist.
   Winners were chosen by the singers, musicians, songwriters and
others in the Nashville-based gospel association, which has 3,200
members.

<HEAD>Graham Family Seeks More Control of Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Graham family is seeking a corporate
charter change to tighten its control of The Washington Post
Company, a move aimed at preventing any outside takeover.
   The proposal, to be voted on by stockholders May 12, is a
reaction to efforts to take control of Media General Inc., based in
Richmond, Va., by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman, Post officials
said today.
   The Post has two classes of stock, one controlled by the Graham
family and the other traded publicly.
   The system was designed so that no takeover could occur without
agreement of the family. However, the number of publicly traded
shares is larger than the total owned by the family, so if the two
types of stock were voted together, the Graham family shares would
be a minority.
   No attempt to acquire the Post has been made, company officials
said.
   However, Sugarman is challenging a similar two-class stock
system in the Media General case.
   So Post officials say they are proposing a charter amendment
that will clearly state that any attempt to take over their company
would have to have separate approval of a majority of each class of
stock.

<HEAD>Shamir Would Welcome A Shevardnadze Visit, Spokesman Says</HEAD>

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is willing to
invite Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to Israel if he
can be sure the invitation will be accepted, a Shamir spokesman
said today.
   The statement came after the Jerusalem Post reported
Shevardnadze planned a visit to Jordan, Syria and possibly Egypt
later this month. Officials at the Soviet Embassy in Amman, Jordan,
confirmed that Shevardnadze will visit the Middle East in late
April.
   Speaking in Geneva Thursday after signing accords on Soviet
troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, Shevardnadze expressed optimism
on prospects for Middle East negotiations modeled on the Afghan
talks.
   ``The signing of the Geneva agreements certainly stimulates
positive processes in the settlement of other regional issues,
including the Middle East,'' he told reporters.
   Although he declined to say if he would visit the region, the
Soviet foreign minister seemed upbeat about the possibility of
arranging talks.
   ``Fairly good prospects are now opening for a resolution of this
most difficult problem,'' he said.
   Officials close to Shamir said Israel would welcome a visit by
Shevardnadze, either by himself or in the company of Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, who is reportedly considering a return to
the Middle East.
   ``The prime minister would very much like to welcome the Soviet
foreign minister to Jerusalem for discussions,'' said Yossi
Ahimeir, a Shamir spokesman. ``But Shamir will not just throw out
an invitation. He needs to know the foreign minister will come.''
   Some observers saw the prime ministry's statement, which was
also published in Israeli newspapers, as a trial balloon.
   A visit by Shevardnadze would signify a major thaw in
Israeli-Soviet relations. Diplomatic ties were severed by Moscow to
protest Israel's occupation of Arab lands in 1967.
   The visit could also spur ahead the stagnant Middle East peace
process. Israel and the United States have said the Soviets must
demonstrate a more balanced approach in the region if they want to
play a role in the peace process.
   Among conditions Shamir has set for Soviet participation in
peace talks are a resumption of diplomatic ties and freer
emigration for about 380,000 Jews Israel says want to leave the
Soviet Union.
   Aides to Shamir said a Shevardnadze visit would not be linked to
those conditions.
   The Soviet Union supports the idea of an international
conference on Middle East peace, a key element of Shultz's recent
peace initiative. But Shultz and Shevardnadze have disagreed on the
authority that forum would wield.
   Shultz envisions a conference as a ceremonial opening to direct
talks, whereas the Soviets have visualized an ongoing conference
actively involved in decision-making.
   Shamir, of the right-wing Likud bloc, sharply opposes an
international conference, fearing it would be hostile to Israel and
lead to territorial concessions.
   His coalition rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the
leftist Labor Party, has advocated the conference as a launching
pad for direct talks.

   Extra units of Israeli soldiers patrolled the
occupied territories today on the Moslem Sabbath, one of the
calmest in more than four months of anti-occupation violence.
   The army clamped a curfew on the Palestinian refugee camp of
Shati in the Gaza Strip, and curfews remained in effect in the West
Bank camps of Balata, Jelazoun and Amari.
   No violent disturbances were reported.
   Near the West Bank town of Beita, the site of a clash 10 days
ago between teen-aged Israeli hikers and Arab villagers in which a
15-year-old Israeli girl was killed, dozens of Jewish settlers held
their own hike to show they would still circulate in the area.
   The hike ended without violence, but settlers complained about a
heavy army presence, Israel army radio said.
   A spokesman for the civil adminstration in the West Bank said
teachers in the territories had been given a three-week mandatory
holiday with half pay, pending an army decision May 8 whether to
reopen schools. Schools have been closed since early February in an
effort to thwart student protests.
   Also Friday, military panels began hearing the appeals of five
out of 12 Palestinians ordered deported this week on charges of
inciting recent unrest.
   On Thursday, Israeli troops shot and killed two Palestinians
after demonstrators pelted them with rocks and cinder blocks. Four
Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the West Bank. Among them
was a 12-year-old boy who lost an eye.
   The deaths brought to 146 the number of Arabs killed since the
unrest broke out Dec. 8. An Israeli soldier and a 15-year-old
Jewish settler also have died.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the army's chief of staff, said the number
and scope of Arab protests in the occupied lands is declining, so
that when soldiers fire on rioters those hit are usually
ringleaders.
   A general strike called Thursday to protest the arrest of nearly
5,000 Palestinians since December brought commerce to a virtual
standstill in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Nevertheless, Shomron said Arabs were tiring after 18 weeks of
violence in the territories Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   Shomron said protests now involve only Palestinian activists,
``so when soldiers are forced to fire, they usually hit the
inciters themselves.''
   ``Many people are simply not going out or don't have enough
motivation to keep it up with the same energy,'' Shomron said.
``You see it in the field.''
   The most serious clash Thursday occurred in the narrow streets
of the Nablus central market, where shops were shuttered because of
the general strike.
   Hospital officials and Arab reporters said youths on rooftops
threw stones and cinder blocks at soldiers, who opened fire and
killed two Palestinians. The army confirmed the deaths but said it
was investigating the circumstances.
   An official at Al Ittihad Hospital said two other Arabs were
shot and wounded.
   In another clash in nearby Tulkarem, a 12-year-old boy lost his
right eye after being hit with a rubber bullet, an official at
Rafidiyeh Hospital in Nablus said. A 17-year-old Palestinian was
shot in the stomach and listed in critical condition.
   Two Jewish children were slightly injured when the bus they were
riding was stoned near the Jewish settlement of Tekoa, south of
Jerusalem, Israel radio reported.
   It said an Israeli passenger bus also was stoned on the
Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway near the Arab village of Abu Gosh. The
vehicle's front windshield was smashed, but there were no injuries.

   Three youths shot to death two national
policemen and seriously injured a third man today in an attack in
the capital of the Basque region, a government spokesman said.
   The spokesman for the Civil Governor's office of Alava province
said the attack occurred about 1:30 p.m. on a central street while
the policemen questioned two people.
   Police identified the dead as national police officers Francisco
Espina Vargas, 32, of Seville, and Antonio Gomez Osuna, 29, of
Coria del Rio in Seville province.
   The third victim, Luis Vivas, 30, apparently a passer-by, was
shot several times. He was in serious condition in a Vitoria
hospital.
   The three youths opened fired on the policemen, who fired back,
before fleeing, the spokesman said.
   The police officers formed part of a motorcycle-riding unit,
police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but police
suspected commandoes of the Basque separatist organization ETA,
which seeks independence from Spain for the three-province northern
Basque region.
   Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has claimed responsibility for
killing more than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil
Guard officers.
   ETA is an acronym in the Basque language for Homeland and
Liberty.
   The deaths brought to four the number of killings this year due
to political violence in Spain.

   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi says Vice
President George Bush is his choice to succeed President Reagan
``because he has suffered from the irrationality of Reagan ... and
he would sort of make up for it.''
   Gadhafi, in a taped interview aired today on NBC-TV's ``Today''
show, said Libyan relations with the United States could improve,
``but with Reagan it is impossible.''
   ``Undoubtedly, relations will improve and any new elected
president would not be as crazy as Reagan,'' he continued, speaking
in Arabic through an interpreter.
   He was then asked about the U.S. presidential contest: ``Do you
see a man there that you admire most and you would like to see to
be president of the United States?''
   Gadhafi responded: ``I think that Mr. Bush who has worked with
Reagan and who has suffered from the irrationality of Reagan and
foolishness and he was an eyewitness of the American damage and
American loss in the period of Reagan. So he would be a better
president because he has suffered with Reagan and he would sort of
make up for it.''

<HEAD>Arias Calls For Election In Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias proposed
today a new presidential election in Panama and said U.S. military
intervention in the country would be a mistake.
   Arias, responding to questions on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America,'' said he believed Panamanian military chief Manuel
Antonio Noriega would agree to an election.
   Arias, who is on a U.S. visit, earlier urged a negotiated
solution rather than increased U.S. pressure to oust Noriega, who
has been indicted on drug trafficking charges by a grand jury in
Florida.
   ``Let us negotiate a new election and let us allow the
Panamanian people to choose the next president through the ballot
box,'' said Arias.
   He said military intervention in the U.S. effort to oust Noriega
would bring a negative reaction across Latin America.
   A Panamanian presidential election is scheduled in May 1989, and
Noriega has said he might be willing to step down as military chief
earlier if the opposition agrees to negotiations over Panama's
political future.
   The United States recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle as Panama's
president. The Noriega-controlled legislature fired Delvalle and
installed the education minister, Manuel Solis Palma, as president.
Delvalle remains in hiding, apparently in Panama.
   The United States froze Panamanian funds in the United States
and took other steps to cut off the flow of dollars to Noreiga
after he was charged with drug trafficking by the grand jury.
   Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said Thursday
that the Reagan administration is running out of plans to oust
Noriega and is doing little to enlist the help of neighboring
countries.
   Pentagon and State Department officials briefed committee
members on possible further economic sanctions against the country,
along with several top-secret, non-economic options, committee
members said.
   Arias told the American Society of Newspaper Editors that the
Panamanian crisis can be resolved only through negotiations.
   If the United States acts unilaterally in Panama, ``you'll be
isolated,'' he told the editors.
   ``You need to get support from the rest of Central America,'' he
said. ``If you want to punish Noriega, economic sanctions are not
the best answer. You are then punishing the Panamanian people but
not General Noriega.''
   Arias, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to bring
peace to Central America, previously urged Panamanian Roman
Catholic Archbishop Marcos G. McGrath to mediate between Noriega
and the opposition parties. But McGrath withdrew as mediator last
week when he couldn't get the two sides together.

<HEAD>Navajo Baby Given To Tribal Authorities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 8{-month-old Navajo girl, caught in a
tug-of-war of cultures and laws, has been handed over to tribal
authorities by the natural mother and the foster parents who cared
for the infant since birth.
   The baby, named Allyssa Kristian, screamed ``Da Da'' Thursday
and reached out for the only family she's ever known as she was
taken away by an Indian social worker.
   Patricia Keetso, the 21-year-old unmarried natural mother who
wanted her baby to be adopted by Rick and Cheryl Pitts of San Jose,
Calif., also cried as she and the couple gave up custody of Allyssa.
   Keetso, her mother and Mrs. Pitts accompanied the social worker,
an Indian attorney and the baby on the flight to Arizona for a
tribal court hearing.
   Pitts accused Navajo authorities of reneging on an agreement to
take a later flight, when his family had reserved seats, and trying
to leave shortly after the exchange. ``You lied to us,'' he yelled
at Patrick Guillery, the Navajo attorney.
   Guillery said he made no promise about when the flight would
leave, and told Pitts he would be violating a court order if he
didn't turn over the baby immediately.
   After the group arrived in Phoenix, the social worker and Navajo
officials got into a van with the baby and left, leaving Keetso and
Mrs. Pitts behind. They had expected to fly with the baby to
Flagstaff before driving to the reservation.
   Navajo Tribal spokeswoman Karen Diakun said the infant was in
the tribe's custody and that the location would not be revealed.
   ``The Division of Social Welfare will make the appropriate
placement until the court decides otherwise,'' Ms. Diakun said,
adding that no date had been set for a hearing on the case at Tuba
City Judicial District Children's Court.
   The Pittses have said they will continue to seek to adopt the
hild.
   Ms. Keetso had met the Pitts couple through an adoption attorney
who advertised in a newspaper on the reservation.
   The Pittses, both 33 and parents of an 8-year-old boy, brought
Ms. Keetso into their home when she was seven months pregnant. They
gave her $200 a month for spending money, paid medical costs,
coached her through labor and brought Allyssa home after her birth
July 20, 1987.
   Despite the wishes of the natural mother, a Santa Clara County
Superior Court judge ruled earlier this week that Allyssa must be
turned over to Navajo authorities, pending a tribal decision on
custody.
   Violet A.P. Lui, an attorney for the Tribal Department of
Justice in Window Rock, Ariz., said a custody hearing would be held
soon. She said she didn't know whether Keetso or the Pittses would
be able to visit the baby.
   The Navajos, citing the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, filed a
complaint in the Santa Clara County court in February to gain
jurisdiction of the case and stop the Pittses' adoption petition.
   San Jose Superior Court Judge Leslie Nichols ruled that Keetso
legally resided on the reservation in Arizona and was under the
jurisdiction of Navajo authorities.
   Rather than appeal Nichols' ruling, the Pittses decided
Wednesday to drop their adoption petition and pursue the case
through the tribal court.

<HEAD>Faulty AIDS Diagnosis Causes Panic, Confusion in West Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A faulty test for AIDS led dozens
of West Germans to believe they had the fatal disease, including a
woman who planned her funeral, a newspaper reported.
   ``This woman lived with the death sentence for 56 days,'' the
Frankfurt Abendpost newspaper said Thursday. It said she wrote a
final testament requesting a white casket with gold lettering for
her burial.
   Her doctor later determined the test was faulty and she didn't
have AIDS, the paper said.
   Another woman was ready to poison herself because an AIDS test
had indicated her husband carried the deadly virus, the newspaper
said. Three days later the doctor said the diagnosis was wrong.
   On Tuesday, the Bavaria state Parliament AIDS committee said up
to 30 percent of AIDS test results in West Germany are incorrect.
   ``There are rheumatism-related illnesses that, at first glance,
react the same as AIDS antibodies,'' committee member and state
parliamentary deputy Karl Heinz Mueller told reporters.
   The committee based its report on recent AIDS test results in a
section of Bavaria state, where 528 of 11,824 patients tested as
AIDS-positive.
   In a second round of testing to confirm results, only 359 of the
528 again tested positive, Mueller said.
   About 500 West Germans a day are tested for the AIDS virus, the
Abendpost newspaper said.
   The committee said it was shocked about the results and called
for uniform procedures in testing and informing patients.
   Social workers Wednesday supported the committee's appeal. They
also criticized doctors who prematurely or without psychological
considerations inform patients they have the virus.
   ``It's pure terror. One can only do that if one wants to
encourage suicide,'' Eberhard Zastrau of the Deutsche Aids-Hilfe
(German AIDS Help) self-help group told The Associated Press in
Munich.
   The committee also said Bavaria state should end its policy of
testing civil service applicants, foreigners applying for asylum
and young men in military service.
   Bavaria state in 1987 introduced tough measures aimed at
preventing the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
including mandatory testing of those groups.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   Ethical and legal questions are behind a
decision to prohibit the National Institutes of Health from using
tissue from intentionally aborted fetuses in genetic research,
administration officials said today.
   The decision came last week in a letter from Dr. Robert E.
Windom, assistant secretary of health at the Department of Health
and Human Services, to NIH Director James B. Wyngaarden.
   ``This proposal raises a number of questions _ primarily ethical
and legal _ that have not been satisfactorily addressed, either
within the Public Health Service or within society,'' Windom wrote.
   His letter was in reponse to a proposal from NIH _ which is part
of the Public Health Service headed by Windom _ to implant fetal
tissue into patients with Parkinson's disease.
   PHS spokesman Jim Brown noted today that Windom's letter
instructs Wyngaarden to appoint an outside advisory committee to
examine the ethical, medical and legal implications of using tissue
from intentionally aborted fetuses.
   He also pointed out that the prohibition does not ban research
on tissue from fetuses from miscarriages or stillbirths, but
acknowledged that it generally is not feasible to use that tissue
in the kind of genetic research the NIH proposal contemplated.
   Brown said Windom anticipates that the advisory committee he has
instructed NIH to form will move quickly _ perhaps within a couple
of months _ to make recommendations.
   Windom was out of town and could not be reached for elaboration.
   His decision was reported initially by The Washington Post.
   ``The morality and science are all mixed together,'' the paper
quoted Windom as saying. ``They need to be evaluated before we rush
ahead. We just can't afford to move too hastily on this.''
   Thousands of aborted fetuses are used each year in research on
Parkinson's disease, juvenile diabetes and leukemia. Researchers
say the special composition of fresh tissue that is obtained
quickly from inducted abortions holds promise for treatment of the
diseases.
   Researchers contacted by the Post expressed dismay at the
decision.
   ``NIH sets the pace, and this will cripple fetal research in the
United States,'' said Dr. Bernard Liebel, professor of medicine at
the University of Toronto.
   ``It is an extraordinarily valuable research tool with immense
potential. Depriving research scientists of this material is a
great disservice to humanity,'' he said.
   Abortion opponents praised the decision.
   ``If the parents were a part to the killing, they have no right
to assign organs to another person,'' said Dr. John C. Willke,
president of the National Right-to-life Committee. ``That is
desecration of a corpse.''
   Researchers told the Post, however, that proper planning is
necessary to retrieve the tissue while it is useful and that it is
rarely possible to use fetuses that have been aborted spontaneously.

<HEAD>British Comic Actor Kenneth Williams Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Kenneth Williams, who starred in more
than 20 of the farcical British ``Carry On'' movies, died suddenly
at his London home today, his agent said. He was 62.
   Agent Gerald Thomas did not reveal the cause of death.
   In addition to the boisterous and often risque ``Carry On''
movies, which poked fun at everyday British life, Williams was a
star of British stage, television and radio.
   He developed a distinctive effeminate voice which became his
trademark, and when he appeared on television his arching eyebrows,
flaring nostrils and rolling eyes made him instantly recognizable.
   The 22 ``Carry On'' films he made, including ``Carry On
Sergeant'' and ``Carry On Camping,'' were full of bottom-pinching
and jokes about faulty plumbing.
   ``I like smutty old jokes,'' he once said. ``Honest vulgarity is
the central tradition of English humor and uninhibitedness the
essence of comedy.''
   Williams first discovered a gift for mimicry in school and
carried on with it as a soldier, entertaining troops in World War II
   His first theatrical job was in Singapore while waiting to be
let out of the armed forces after serving in India, Burma and
Singapore.
   ``Kenneth was a wonderful character and his death will be a
terrible loss to us all,'' Thomas said.
   ``He was an actor whose talents were never fully used. He
developed a style all of his own. As a person he was a great
raconteur who really sang for his supper.''
   Williams, a bachelor, once proclaimed he had ``never been in
love'' and thought marriage was unnatural. He lived alone in an
apartment next door to his mother, Louisa.
   Williams said in his 1985 autobiography that he never wanted to
play serious roles.
   ``Laughs are more important than tears,'' he said. ``There are
plenty of people who can play serious roles ... but there are not
many who can be funny.''
   Of life in general he said: ``The shorter the better. I think to
go at 65 or 70 is fine. Why hang about?''

   Four members of a family were found
stabbed to death early today in a mobile home, and the bodies were
so brutally mutilated that police did not recognize at first that
one victim was a male.
   ``It resembles the Charles Manson thing. It's the worst I've
seen in 28 years on the department,'' Sgt. George Wilson told the
San Antonio Express-News.
   ``It's unbelievable. All of them were savagely stabbed. There
are knives broken off in their necks,'' said Wilson.
   Officers were searching for a man who was seen leaving the
mobile home in a car belonging to one of the victims.
   Police first reported that four girls had been killed, but the
mother of the victims later confirmed that one was a boy.
   The mother collapsed after identifying her children, police said.
   The killer used an entire set of kitchen steak knives, police
said. Broken knife blades were scattered around the mobile home and
some knives had been broken off and left in the bodies.
   ``It's a mess down there. A real mess,'' said San Antonio
Detective Richard Roberts.
   A friend identified the victims as Jennifer Mann, 19; Shannon
Mann, 17; Martha Mann, 14, and Ernest Mann, 13.
   A former neighbor, Janice Pope, identified the parents as Ernest
and Becky Mann, who are separated.
   Police Lt. Weldon Stinson said three of the victims were nude.
   Officers were unable to determine immediately whether the
victims had been sexually assaulted.
   An ambulance attendant who was inside the mobile home park told
reporters the interior of the home looked like ``a slaughterhouse.''
   Officers were called to the mobile home in the Villa Grande
Mobile Home Park at 3:27 a.m. by a person who said a girl was
fighting with her boyfriend, Stinson said. When police arrived at
3:55 a.m., Stinson said, officers found the bodies.
   Yvonne Ochoa, 20, said she had worked with Jennifer Mann at a
grocery store until they both resigned two months ago.
   Ms. Ochoa said the victim was shy. ``She wouldn't talk, but she
asked me about married life and said she was wanting to move in
with her boyfriend. They were always breaking up but she said she
loved him.
   ``She said that he hit her and that he also broke into her other
house but that she still wanted to marry,'' Ms. Ochoa said.
   Officers said there were signs that at least some of the victims
had struggled with their assailants. Others may have been killed in
their sleep, officers said.
   Authorities said the telephone jacks had been ripped from the
wall of the mobile home.
   Reporters were being kept about one-quarter mile away from the
scene on the south side of San Antonio.
   At one point, the father of the victims struck a television
cameraman and had to be restrained from striking a second one,
authorities said. Four officers restrained him.
   ``Get those cameras out of here. This is not a carnival! This is
not a damn circus!'' the father said.
   Manson was convicted of directing the murder of actress Sharon
Tate and six other people in 1969. Four members of Manson's cult
were convicted of commiting the murders.

<HEAD>Former President's Brother Says He Won't Give Up In Fight With
Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLAINS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billy Carter says he's continuing to receive
weekly treatments for pancreatic cancer and will continue to fight
the disease even though he's been told it's fatal.
   ``I haven't given up yet,'' the brother of former President
Jimmy Carter said in an interview broadcast today on ABC-TV's
``Good Morning America.''
   ``I still think I'm going to beat it, you know. I'm going to try
everything. ... I'm going to my seventh treatment next week, and if
he doesn't do any good I'm going to another one, and then I'm going
to try a voodoo doctor, you know, and a snake doctor. I'm going to
fight it as long as I can.''
   In the interview, conducted Thursday in Plains, Carter said he
and his brother have grown closer since both moved back to their
south Georgia hometown.
   ``He lives right around the corner, and we've become extremely
close since I found out (about the cancer),'' he said.
   Billy Carter became known for his wise-cracking and
beer-drinking during his brother's 1976 campaign, but quit drinking
nine years ago after undergoing treatment at a California
alcoholism center.
   Carter, 51, was told by doctors last fall that he had inoperable
pancreatic cancer, the same disease which killed his father and his
sister.
   He has credited a new treatment involving injections of a
compound containing platinum with prolonging his life beyond the
short spans lived by his father, James Earl Carter, and sister,
Ruth Carter Stapleton, after they were stricken.
   He said his brother's election in 1976 completely changed his
own life, propelling him from the simple life of a peanut farmer in
Plains to the problems of national celebrity.
   ``I've been asked a thousand times, I guess, what would I do if
I had to do it over again, and I said I'd probably do the same
thing because if I had it to do over I'd probably screw it up
worse,'' Carter said.
   He said he was sorry for his drinking, but had no other regrets
about his life.

<TEXT>
   Libya today marked the second anniversary
of the U.S. bombing of Tripoli and led foreign dignitaries on a
tour of the ruins of Col. Moammar Gadhafi's former home.
   About 40 delegates to an international terrorism conference and
a few journalists were ushered into the Libyan leader's two-story
concrete house shortly before 2 a.m. to coincide with the time of
the American raid on April 15, 1986.
   Libyan officials promised that the Libyan leader would make an
appearance, but Gadhafi didn't show up.
   In Italy, a man claiming to speak for the Organization of Jihad
Brigades claimed that the bombing of a U.S. military club Thursday
was in retaliation for the U.S. raid on Libya. The bombing in
Naples killed an American servicewoman and four Italian civilians.
   Another bomb exploded today in at a U.S. Air Force radio relay
station near Madrid. There were no injuries. The Spanish national
news agency EFE cited an unidentified Defense Ministry source as
saying the attack could be related to the Libyan anniversary.
   Also today, police clashed with stone-throwing protesters near
the U.S. Embassy in Manila, Philippines, and blocked a nearby march
by Moslems protesting the U.S. bombing raids.
   In downtown Tripoli, all was quiet. Libya said 37 people,
including Gadhafi's baby daughter, were killed in the American
attack, which was in retaliation for alleged Libyan involvement in
the bombing of a West German nightclub. That blast killed two U.S.
soldiers and a Turkish woman.
   ``Even if they were able to kill me on that day _ the day of the
U.S.-NATO barbarous aggression _ even if they were able to do that
in the future, that does not mean that they have succeeded in
accomplishing what they wanted,'' the official JANA news agency
quoted Gadhafi as saying Wednesday during a speech to the terrorism
conference.
   There was no explanation for Gadhafi's absence from today's
tour. Since the bombing, countless visitors to Libya have been
taken to tour the house. Blown out windows have been covered with
plastic sheeting.
   ``This is one of the two bedrooms where the children slept,'' a
Libyan official said, pointing to an unlit room littered with
glass. Several schoolbooks and notebooks, including a coloring book
with pictures of animals, were strewn on one bed.
   Hotel gift shops sell postcards of Gadhafi's adopted daughter
Hana, who reportedly died in the raid.
   The interior walls, including those of two bedrooms, bear chalk
inscriptions in Arabic that Libyan guides said were written by
students visiting the house.
   They said the inscriptions praise Gadhafi and denounce President
Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The U.S.
bombers that participated in the raid took off from a base in
Britain.
   In front of the entrance hall, the Libyans have erected a
12-foot high tin hand with its fingers gripped around a splintered
silver jet representing the U.S. bombers.
   Those on the tour included delegates from Italy, Greece, Togo,
Tunisia and Canada.
   Gadhafi told them that Mediterranean nations should ``start the
struggle to rid the waterway from the fleets of terrorism, from
nuclear arms and from military exercises.``
   He said he endorsed Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's proposal
to withdraw both the U.S. and Soviet fleets from the Mediterranean.

<TEXT>
   Two hostages aboard a hijacked jumbo jet
broadcast messages today saying they would be killed if the Kuwaiti
government did not bend to the demands of the Arab gunmen holding
the plane.
   About 30 passengers were reported being held in grim conditions,
all handcuffed and forced to remain silent. About four crew members
also are believed to be aboard the jet.
   The Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 was hijacked April 5 on a flight
from Bangkok to Kuwait with 112 people aboard. It was forced to
land at Mashhad in northeastern Iran, where the hijackers freed 57
hostages.
   The plane then flew on to Larnaca, Cyprus, where 13 people were
released and two Kuwaitis were killed. It arrived in Algiers
Tuesday night.
   The hijackers are demanding that Kuwait release 17 jailed
pro-Iranian terrorists. Kuwaiti officials have refused.
   The two recorded messages, almost identical in wording, were
sent by radio from the plane to the control tower at Houari
Boumedienne Airport.
   ``In the name of God the merciful, I greet my family and my
friends and I ask the Kuwaiti authorities to free the 17 prisoners
held in Kuwaiti prisons,'' said Soleiman Mohammed Soleiman
al-Mashari. ``In the event of refusal, they are going to kill us.''
   In a second message, a man identifying himself as Mohammed Ahmed
Al-Ajem said: ``I am one of the hostages from the Boeing ... and I
ask the Kuwaiti authorities to free the prisoners held in the
prisons. Without that, the kidnappers have decided to kill us.''
   A passenger made a similar plea Thursday.
   The hijackers released one of their captives Thursday during the
second day of negotiations here with a Kuwaiti delegation through
Algerian mediators.
   The freed hostage, Djuma Abdallah Chatti of Kuwait, is a
70-year-old diabetic who doctors said urgently needed an insulin
shot.
   The gunmen issued a statement saying they would not budge in
their demand that the 17 prisoners be released. They said they
stood by their demand ``even if the price we have to pay is very
high.''
   ``We are not highway bandits,'' they said in the statement,
radioed to the control tower in Arabic and English. ``We are men of
principle.''
   According to a Kuwaiti official who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Chatti reported that the hostage worst affected was
Fadel Al-Sabah, 33, cousin of the emir of Kuwait, regarded as the
hijackers' most valuable captive. Al-Sabah's two sisters also are
on board.
   Chatti was quoted as saying Al-Sabah suffered from a severe
nervous disorder even before he boarded the plane, and the
experience of the hijack ``seems to have put him over the brink.''
   Al-Sabah had continuous violent shakes, could not speak and
``just cries all the time,'' he said.
   Chatti said there were eight hijackers. Other freed passengers
have said there were between five and eight.
   ``Praise to God, I am fine, but they had me tied all the time
and I am tired,'' Chatti told reporters in the airport lounge.
``They are not good people. They beat me.''
   Chatti was examined on board Thursday by an physician who told
the hijackers the man would die unless freed.
   The Kuwaiti official quoted Chatti as saying all hostages had
their hands handcuffed behind their backs at all times and were not
allowed to speak or move.
   The official said Chatti had deep, bleeding cuts on both wrists
from the handcuffs he said he was forced to wear since the plane
was in Mashhad.
   The Kuwaiti official quoted Chatti as saying four bombs made of
stick explosives connected by wires were attached to the four doors
in the plane's midsection.
   In Washington, lawmakers on Thursday urged Secretary of State
George P. Shultz to intervene because of reports that one of the
hijackers might be responsible for kidnapping American journalist
Terry Anderson in Lebanon.
   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was seized March 16, 1985 and is the longest-held of the 22
foreign hostages in Lebanon. Nine are Americans.
   Kuwait's independent al-Qabas newspaper reported Wednesday that
the alleged kidnapper, Imad Mughniyeh, was believed to have boarded
the plane when it landed in Mashhad, Iran.
   Mughniyeh has been identified as one of the security chiefs in
Beirut for Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be the
umbrella organization for pro-Iranian groups holding the hostages.

<HEAD>U.S. State Department Official Visits Tibet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A senior U.S. State Department official in Tibet
is investigating human rights issues in the remote mountain region,
authorities said today.
   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing said J. Stapleton Roy, deputy
assistant secretary of state, is visiting several cities in Tibet
with an officer from the American consulate in Chengdu, southwest
China.
   ``The main reason he's going is to see the situation for
himself,'' said press officer Andew C. Koss.
   A report on Tibet regional radio said Roy had met with Mao
Rubai, deputy secretary of the Communist Party in Tibet. The report
said Roy raised human rights questions, among other issues.
   Mao told Roy that the ``leftist errors'' of the past, when
Tibetan religion and customs were oppressed, had been rectified and
defended China's human rights record in Tibet, the radio said.
   Tibet has erupted in violence twice in the past six months, with
Buddhist monks leading anti-Chinese, pro-independence riots last
fall and again on March 5.
   The disturbances last September and October in the capital of
Lhasa, which left an estimated 14 dead. They caused a rift in
U.S.-Chinese relations, with Congress accusing China of human
rights violations and China charging the United States with
interference in China's internal affairs.
   The U.S. government backs Beijing's contention that Tibet is
part of China, but members of Congress have expressed support for
Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who has been living in
exile in India since 1959.
   After last fall's riots, Tibetan authorities closed the area to
foreign journalists and diplomats and all but a few well-watched
tourist groups.
   Since late February the restrictions on foreign visitors have
been eased somewhat, although the March 5 riots, in which as many
as 24 people were killed and hundreds arrested, prompted another
clampdown on visits.
   Chinese officials continue to insist that Tibet, which has
promoted tourism as a major source of revenue, is open. But they
say the region can handle only a limited number of people at any
one time.
   Roy leads the second U.S. government delegation to Tibet this
spring, following a group led by U.S. Rep. Sonny Montgomery,
D-Miss., a member of the House Armed Services Committee.
   Roy is to return to Beijing Sunday.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today filed a formal
diplomatic protest with the United States over what it called
``violations of Panama's sovereignty'' by American troops.
   The note said U.S. troops closed a Panamanian highway during a
two-hour firefight Tuesday night ``between soldiers of the United
States and an unknown group.''
   Foreign Minister Jorge Abadia called the act a ``flagrant
violation of Panama's sovereignty'' by U.S. soldiers who ``violated
Panamanian territory in a visible form.''
   The highway was closed for three hours Tuesday night, when U.S.
officials said about 100 Marines exchanged fire with 40 to 50
uniformed intruders at a fuel dump near Howard Air Force Base
outside Panama City.
   The U.S. Southern Command said it consulted with the Panama
Defense Forces before closing the highway for ``security reasons.''
The highway runs past the air base and connects the capital with
the western part of the country.
   Copies of the protest note were sent to Javier Perez de Cuellar,
secretary general of the United Nations.
   Marines scouring rugged jungle at a fuel depot have found no
evidence to back sentrys' claims that uniformed intruders engaged
them in a nighttime firefight, the U.S. military says.
   Still, and despite Panamanian ridicule, the Americans stood by
their story.
   The Southern Command said a Marine was accidentally shot to
death by another Marine on Monday night as they investigated what
was described as a break-in by six to eight ``uniformed,
camouflaged intruders'' at the depot.
   The next night, the Southern Command said, about 100 Marines and
40 to 50 intruders ``wearing dark uniforms'' engaged in a two-hour
firefight. No injuries were reported.
   Bill Ormsby, a civilian spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command,
said Thursday that it would take at least another day for soldiers
to complete their inspection of the 807-acre Arraijan Tank Farm.
   Asked if the Southern Command was still sticking to its accounts
in the absence of concrete evidence, Ormsby replied: ``Yes, sir, we
are.''
   On Thursday, state-run news media and Panama's Defense Forces
heaped scorn on the American story.
   ``Marines Made Fools Of,'' a headline in red ink said in the
morning tabloid Critica, which is controlled by the government.
   The story said the Marines had shouted ``cries of fear,
desperation and terror'' during the reported skirmishes. A cartoon
showed a Marine smoking marijuana against a backdrop of swaying
palms.
   The United States maintains about 10,000 troops in Panama as a
permanent force to defend the Panama Canal. About 1,300 more U.S.
servicemen were sent to Panama last week to increase security for
the canal and U.S. citizens there.
   On Tuesday, a Pentagon spokesman suggested Monday night's
intrusion had been made by members of the Defense Forces, an
assertion angrily denied by the Panamanian government.
   In describing the Tuesday night incident, Southern Command
officials carefully avoided implicating the Panamanian military,
saying the reported intruders could not be identified ``with any
particular organization.''
   The Defense Forces are headed by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
the power behind Panama's civilian government.
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on charges of
drug trafficking, and the Reagan Administration has been seeking
his ouster for months.
   Last month, in an attempt to force out Noriega, the Reagan
administration began freezing Panamanian funds in the United
States, creating a cash shortage in the country.

<TEXT>
   The University of Michigan regents left
their regular meeting under guard and went into closed session
today for the second day in a row after they were disrupted by
students protesting anti-discrimination policy.
   There were scuffles between security guards and some of the 30
protesters who attended the open meeting after the regents were led
out, but no injuries were reported. At least three people were hurt
during a similar confrontation Thursday, when protests also forced
the regents into a closed meeting.
   Soon after the closed meeting began, the protesters left the
administration building, shouting they would return with enough
students to surround it, WAAM radio reported.
   Corey Dolgon, chairman of the Campus Governance Committee of the
University of Michigan Student Government, said the students wanted
to let the regents know how angry they are about a proposed
anti-discrimination policy and about being shut out of the meeting.
   The anti-discrimination policy was meant to counter racial and
sexual harassment on campus.
   The Michigan Student Assembly and other opponents complain that
interim president Robben Fleming drafted the policy without
consulting students and that it targets student misconduct without
addressing such action by the university and its administrators.
   Fleming ``has a history of neglecting student input, and now
he's trying to throw this code down the students' throats,'' Jackie
Victor, a former co-chair of the student assembly's Peace and
Justice Committee, said Thursday.
   Protesters also demanded the dismissals of Regent Deane Baker
and Peter Steiner, dean of the College of Literature, Sciences and
Arts.
   Victor said Baker has offended students for years with his
attitudes about minorities and homosexuals and his support for
military research at the university.
   Steiner has been under fire since January, when students
obtained a copy of his remarks during a closed faculty meeting in
September when he warned against lowering university standards to
recruit more black students. He later apologized for phrasing of
his remarks but denied they were racist.
   On Thursday, about 35 students protested during a public board
of regents session and demanded the dismissal of Fleming and two
other top officials, said Joseph Owsley, the school's director of
news and information.
   The regents adjourned and headed upstairs to a conference room
to continue the meeting without spectators, Owsley said. The
protesters followed them and tried to enter the room while security
guards held them back, he said.
   At least two school officials and one protester were slightly
injured, but none required hospital treatment.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The guided-missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts
encountered a mine field with numerous mines Thursday morning
before its hull was ripped open by one of the underwater
explosives, Pentagon officials said today.
   The frigate had come to an almost complete stop in the water at
the time of the explosion after successfully maneuvering away from
several mines spotted by lookouts, the officials said.
   The effort to maneuver out of the mine field was hampered by
rough seas, however, and the mine the Roberts eventually hit was
probably moored to the bottom, the officials said.
   The defense officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only if
not identified, said at least two mines had been spotted today by a
reconnaissance helicopter dispatched by other Navy ships in the
area.
   The sources said the Navy now had four mine-sweeping ships
closing in on the patch of water in the central gulf where the
Roberts was hit to begin a search.
   ``Ideally, we'd like to recover one of these mines,'' said one
source. ``But we also want to do it safely. The seas out there are
still heavy. It may take a while.
   ``We might end up just blowing them (the mines) up. But we're
pretty much convinced this is a new field that was just laid. And
we certainly suspect the Iranians are behind it.''
   The sources also said today the frigate had suffered extensive
damage.
   ``At one point, there was 12 feet of water inside the engine
room,'' said one official. ``The crew just did a hell of a job. She
(the ship) took a really bad hit.''
   Ten sailors were injured _ two of them critically with
second-degree burns _ when the Roberts was ripped by the underwater
explosion at 10:10 a.m. EDT. There were no fatalities.
   The Pentagon said it had been decided to tow the Roberts to
Dubai instead of Bahrain as earlier announced, and a commercial
tugboat, the Hunter, was now en route with it. The Pentagon
declined to estimate when the ship might arrive.
   One source said that by towing the Roberts to Dubai, the Navy
could move the ship immediately into a dry dock there for repairs.
While the Navy uses Bahrain as a base for its Persian Gulf forces,
there are no large dry dock facilities on that island.
   The sources said the Navy would not be able to tell the full
extent of the damage or make any decisions about repairs until the
ship was out of the water.
   ``We know the damage is bad, though,'' said one. ``They're
towing her only at about five knots because they don't think she
can take any more.''

<HEAD>BLM to Stop Giving Away Large Numbers of Wild Horses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bureau of Land Management today said it
would curtail its practice of giving away large numbers of wild
horses.
   Though the bureau did not mention it in the announcement, it has
previously admitted that instances of what appeared to be abuse of
animals in North Dakota and Nebraska might help end its no-fee
``adoptions.''
   Since 1976, more than 86,000 horses have been removed from the
range in the West and placed with private owners, and the bureau
will continue to offer horses to individuals.
   The bureau charges $125 per horse, but has been waiving the
charge for people willing to take 100 or more.
   Robert Burford, director of the bureau, said in the announcement
the bureau still would accept applications for waiver of the fee
from non-profit groups working to improve the adoptability of wild
horses.
   Young horses find ready takers, but older animals are harder to
break and for that reason are in less demand.
   Burford said the bureau had ``great hopes for another concept
being developed, that of privately funded wild horse sanctuaries,''
and also would step up its use of prison inmates to break horses.

   Police said today that a member of Japan's
Red Army terrorist group was the prime suspect in a car bomb
explosion outside a U.S. military club that killed an American
servicewoman and four Italians.
   Investigators said they were searching for Junzo Okudaira, 39,
who is also suspected in rocket and bomb attacks on the U.S. and
British embassies in Rome last June.
   At least 17 people, including four U.S. sailors, were hurt in
the Thursday night blast outside the United Services Organization
club in downtown Naples.
   The Pentagon identified the slain sailor as 21-year-old Angela
Simone Santos, a radioman 3rd class from Ocala, Fla. She had been
stationed at the Naval Communications Area Major Station in Naples
since March 1985.
   A man called a French news agency office in Rome today and
claimed the attack in the name of a group calling itself the
Organization of Jihad Brigades.
   ``The American imperialists must die today, two years after
their barbarous attack against the Libyan Arab state,'' the caller
said in accented English. ``Jihad'' means ``holy war'' in Arabic.
   At 2 a.m. on April 15, 1986, the United States bombed the Libyan
capital in retaliation for alleged Libyan involvement in the
bombing of a West Berlin nightclub. Two U.S. servicemen and a
Turkish woman died in the nightclub blast.
   The Libyan ambassador to Italy, Abdulrahman Shargam, told the
ANSA news agency that attempts to link Libya to the bombing were
disinformation.
   Romano Argenio of Italy's anti-terrorist police said
investigators believed Okudaira had accomplices and that they were
taking the claim seriously.
   ``We do not think that the attack was organized by the Red Army
alone,'' said Argenio, who is leading the investigation. ``We think
he was working with other terrorist groups which we are still
trying to identify.``
   Argenio said Okudaira is believed to have parked the rented car,
laden with explosives, outside the club.
   Earlier, ANSA quoted an unidentified police official as saying
``the Middle East connection seems most likely.'' State-run RAI
television reported receiving a call today from a man who said
``Justice has been done for the Lebanese people.''
   The blast damaged the club's interior, wrecked cars and
shattered windows along narrow San Marco street.
   The slain Italians included a souvenir vendor who regularly sat
outside the club and three passers-by.
   The bomb, in a white car with Milan license plates, exploded at
about 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT). Navy spokesman Lt. David Morris said
most of the sailors in the club were from the frigates USS
Capodanno and USS Paul, which are anchored in Naples.
   U.S. sailor John Nichols from the USS Paul was quoted in Naples'
Il Mattino newspaper as saying he saw a man with dark hair and
olive skin, who ``didn't look like an Italian,'' put something
inside the car and flee just before it exploded.
   ``We were getting ready to lower the shutters when the world
exploded around us. We heard desperate shouts. We ran out into the
street,'' said Valaria Spinetti, 22, who works at a nearby store.
   ``God what a terrible scene. I saw three or for people
transformed into torches who were crying for help,'' she added. ``I
went back into the store to get a fire extinguisher. When I went
back into the street they were already burned beyond recognition.''
   One of the bodies was later drapped with an American flag.
   Okudaira was identified as having rented the car that blew up
outside the U.S. Embassy in Rome last June. There were no injuries
in either that attack of the one on the British Embassy.
   Okudaira is also suspected of involvement in attacks on Western
embassie in Europe in the 1970s.
   He was arrested in Jordan in 1976 on charges of possessing a
false passport and deported to Japan but was freed in 1977 when
hijackers of a Japan Air Lines jet in Bangladesh demanded his
release.
   Morris identified the wounded sailors as Chief Petty Officer
Francisco A. Navalta, 39; of Castillejos, Zambales, Philippines;
Petty Officer 3rd Class Craig Lee Trent, 22, of Gaither, Md.;
Stanley Lawson, 27, 3rd Class electronics technician, of Maumee,
Ohio; and Senior Chief Petty Officer Charles Fifer Roberts, 38, of
East St. Louis, Ill.
   Morris said they were in stable condition at the U.S. Navy
hospital in Agnano, outside Naples, but he would not describe the
injuries. Roberts was treated and released.
   The Navy has a major presence in Naples, which is headquarters
for NATO's Southern Command and the support center for the U.S. 6th
Fleet, which has about 45 ships.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and three
other grim-faced diplomats who signed the Afghan accords studiously
avoided the word ``peace'' to describe what they had achieved.
   The tragic reality behind what Shultz called a historic
agreement is that the killing will go on in Afghanistan, as it did
in Vietnam for two years after Henry Kissinger put his signature on
a similar accord in 1973.
   Yes, the Soviets pledged to remove their 115,000 troops from
Afghanistan by Feb. 15, 1989.
   Yes, Shultz left Geneva and the signing ceremony in the United
Nations Palace of Justice talking about worldwide efforts to help
Afghan refugees return to villages no longer threatened by Soviet
napalm and helicopter gunships.
   Yes, the agreement signed Thursday by the foreign ministers of
the government in Kabul, Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet
Union opens the way for what Shultz called ``Afghan control over
Afghanistan.''
   Although the Soviets have not stated their intentions publicly,
the sad expectation is that that the Soviets will continue to arm
the Afghan government they have backed for a decade and the Afghan
mujahadeen supported by the United States will continue receiving
weapons from a CIA pipeline.
   Today, however, a high administration official, speaking on
condition he not be identified, said the United States still hopes
that the Soviets may elect to end shipments to Afghanistan and let
that long war wind down.
   The United States tried to get the Soviets to agree to a mutual
cutoff of weaponry, but that effort failed so it is likely the
Afghan rivals will continue receiving the means to kill each
others' adherents.
   The accords signed in Geneva do not end the war; they merely
begin the end to Soviet troop participation in it. Shultz
acknowledged the agreement was ``not perfect.'' But he and
officials who traveled with him to Geneva were clearly satisfied
with what had been accomplished.
   The United States, its allies, the Islamic world and most of the
rest of the world have been railing against the Soviets for more
than eight years for sending troops to Afghanistan. To bring that
withdrawal about, after the loss of an estimated million Afghan
lives, was a major victory, Shultz said, prompting him to proclaim,
``History has been made today.''
   The agreement also will permit the United States to step back a
bit from deep involvement in Afghanistan affairs, the officials
said.
   After all, before the Soviets turned Afghanistan into a
superpower sore point, the United States had little interest in the
incessant warfare within Afghan's tribal society.
   The Soviet decision to withdraw could lead to the restoration of
Afghanistan to that shelf of countries the United States need not
worry about and the officials seemed pleased at that prospect.
   There was a touch of irony to the signing ceremony in that it
took place in the same chamber where the superpowers blessed a 1955
Indochina accord that eventually failed.
   The parallels between Afghanistan in the 1980s and Vietnam,
particularly in the 1970s, are inescapable.
   A superpower bogged down in an unpopular war at home and abroad,
realizing its superior firepower cannot defeat a tenacious
guerrilla force armed by another superpower, signs an agreement
permitting disengagement ``with honor.''
   In 1973, Secretary of State Kissinger set the stage in the Paris
accords for U.S. troop withdrawal, turning the struggle over to the
well-stocked South Vietnamese. By April 1975, the North Vietnamese
had won.
   On Thursday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who
signed the troop withdrawal pledge, said supplies to the
``legitimate'' government of Afghan leader Najib would continue.
   Shevardnadze, sounding vaguely like the American officials of
the 1970s, tried to put the best face on what had happened.
   How will Soviet generals swallow their defeat, he was asked at a
news conference? ``Soviet generals don't think they lost the war,''
he replied.
   He feigned ignorance of a well-publicized Soviet academician's
assertion that Moscow's initial decision in 1979 to send in the
troops was a mistake.
   The Soviet Union went into Afghanistan to help a besieged,
legitimate government, he said.
   Behind the gloss, U.S. officials said, was a clear Soviet
determination to end its involvement _ a determination unthreatened
by last-minute finagling over the continuation of superpower
assistance.
   Asked if Shevardnadze's condemnation of U.S. assistance for the
rebels could unravel the agreement, one official laughed and
declared: ``They aren't looking for a pretext to stay.''
   The accepted wisdom at the Pentagon and the State Department has
the Najib government collapsing eventually because it has little
support among Afghans.
   Yet there is no consensus in Washington on how soon that could
happen.
   The most graceful transition to peace could come about through a
further mediation effort by Diego Cordovez, the United Nations
official who led the negotiations that resulted in Thursday's
accord.
   Cordovez has agreed to begin talks with the factions on creating
an interim government to supplant the Marxist Najib regime.
   In the meantime, Najib and his enemies, the mujahadeen, vow to
continue the struggle and the killing will continue.

   The U.S. Navy said the guided-missile
frigate that struck an underwater mine in the Persian Gulf was out
of danger today. Two of the 10 seamen injured were in critical
condition.
   The USS Samuel B. Roberts was being towed to Dubai, Navy
officials said.
   ``The ship is under control. It is out of danger,'' said U.S.
Central Command spokesman Lt. Col. John Head. The Navy declined to
give the exact location of the ship.
   Iran said it fired six missiles on Iraqi economic and military
installations in the cities of Basra, Ali-gharbi and Khaneghein.
There was no immediate confirmation from Iraq.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency earlier reported
that 13 civilians were killed and a number of others injured in
overnight Iraqi bombing raids on the western Iranian cities of
Hamadan and Bakhtaran.
   Pentagon officials said today that the Roberts encountered a
mine field with numerous mines before its hull was ripped open by
one of the underwater explosives.
   The frigate had come to an almost complete stop in the water at
the time of the explosion after successfully maneuvering away from
several mines spotted by lookouts, the officials said.
   The effort to maneuver out of the mine field was hampered by
rough seas, however, and the mine the Roberts eventually hit was
probably moored to the bottom, the officials said.
   The Navy said the 3,700-ton Roberts was in no danger of sinking.
The explosion occurred about 55 miles northeast of the Qatar
peninsula while the Roberts was on patrol.
   Four of the injured seamen were taken to Bahrain's Salmaniya
hospital. Head said two were suffering from second-degree burns
over 40 percent of their bodies and were in critical condition.
   The third had second-degree burns over 15 percent of his body,
while the fourth was suffering from lower-back problems and smoke
inhalation.
   The other six injured sailors were under observation aboard the
combat store ship San Jose. Head said they were listed in good
condition.
   The Roberts was sailing southward on a return trip from Kuwait
after escorting one of 11 U.S.-reflagged Kuwaiti tankers.
   Iran was blamed for a spate of mine blasts in the gulf last year
i spillovers of its 7{-year-old war with Iraq.
   The Roberts and Wainwright are two of 14 Navy ships assigned to
the U.S. force in the gulf to protect merchant vessels flying the
U.S. flag.
   The Roberts is based in Newport, R.I., and left there for gulf
duty on Jan. 11. The Navy said about 225 men were aboard.
   Officials said the type of mine suspected of causing the
explosion was not immediately known.
   The $400 million, 445-foot frigate was the second U.S. warship
hit in the gulf in the past 12 months. The frigate USS Stark, the
same type of guided-missile frigate as the Roberts, was hit by an
Iraqi missile in the gulf last May.
   Iraq apologized for the attack, which killed 37 sailors, saying
it mistook the Stark for an Iranian warship.
   The Bridgeton, a Kuwaiti tanker sailing under the U.S. flag, hit
a mine near Iran's Farsi Island in July 1987.
   The United States has six mine sweepers in the waterway but they
have worked mainly in the northern gulf.
   The Reagan administration increased the U.S. force in the region
last July in response to a request from Kuwait, whose oil tankers
had been targeted by Iran.
   The Navy identified seven of the 10 injured sailors as: Petty
Officer 1st Class Joseph Dane Boyd, 29, of Royston, Ga.; Petty
Officers 3rd Class David John Burbine, 23, of Ashaway, R.I., Jack
Thomas Paprocki, 24, of Salem, Ore. and Randy Lee Thomas, 22, of
Milwaukee; Chief Petty Officer Alex Perez, 38, of Los Angeles;
Seamam Wayne Jackson Smith, 18, of Clearfield, Pa., and Petty
Officer 2nd Class John Douglas Thomas, 21, of Slocomb, Ala.

   A federal magistrate assigned a lawyer today
to meet with a Japanese man who has refused to speak to officials
trying to find out why he carried three powerful bombs in his car
on the New Jersey Turnpike.
   U.S. Magistrate Ronald Hedges said the lawyer, Thomas Higgins,
would explain to Yu Kikumura the charges pending against him.
Hedges then recessed a hearing, called to consider bail for
Kikumura, while Kikumura met with Higgins.
   Kikumura is being held on federal charges of possessing a
fraudulent visa and illegally possessing unregistered firearms, the
explosives. If convicted, he faces up to $260,000 in fines and up
to 15 years in prison.
   In addition to the explosives, authorities revealed in court
today that Kikumura was carrying $3,600.
   Kikumura, 35, entered the country March 8 and was arrested by a
state trooper Tuesday at the Vince Lombardi rest area in
Ridgefield, authorities said.
   U.S. officials have been unable to confirm reports by the
Japanese Foreign Ministry that Kikumura is a suspected member of
the terrorist group Red Army, said John C. McGlinley, special agent
in charge of the FBI's Newark office.
   Officials have yet to link Kikumura with any group and were
exploring any international ties he might have, McGlinley said.
   ``We have a lot of unanswered questions that we have to
answer,'' he said.
   The Red Army is suspected of involvement in a bombing which
killed five people, including a U.S. servicewoman, in Naples,
Italy, on Thursday. Italian police said a known member of the Red
Army is believed to have rented the car that exploded outside an
American military club.
   A spokesman for the FBI here, James J. Knights, refused to
comment on the Italian bombing and any connection to Kikumura's
activities.
   ``We're not saying anything about that,'' he said today. ``We're
not making any linkage between the two.''
   Kikumura, who was identified by officials in Japan through
fingerprints, faced a bail hearing under heavy guard Thursday
before Superior Court Judge Charles DiGisi, who released him to
federal agents without setting bail.
   Kikumura told DiGisi he would not talk to federal authorities
until a lawyer was appointed for him.
   Meanwhile, Japanese police refused to comment on Kyodo news
service reports Kikumura was believed to have established links to
the leftist Red Army, a Japanese terrorist group, in 1974 when he
ran a bookshop in Athens, Greece.
   The news service said Kikumura's arrest had raised suspicions
the Red Army might be planning attacks during the summit of leaders
of advanced industrial nations June 19 in Toronto, Canada.
   The Red Army advocates ``simultaneous world revolution'' and is
believed to have members allied with pro-Palestinian groups in
Lebanon.
   State Police Superintendent Col. Clinton Pagano said a terrorist
task force is investigating the case because of the sophisticated
nature of the bombs, which police said were made from three 18-inch
steel cylinders. Authorities said they found 15 pounds of black
powder in the car.
   Federal officials estimated that the explosives in the car were
capable of destroying the car and a ``substantial part of a normal
dwelling.''

   A rapist who found no home in California
after being paroled last year will join a religious community in
Oregon, the group's leader says.
   Lawrence Singleton, who is scheduled to be released from San
Quentin state prison in California later this month, has been
invited to join members of the Bride of Christ Church in Azalea,
said Thomas Clyde Smith Jr., pastor of the fundamentalist sect.
   Singleton was convicted Sept. 29, 1978, of raping a teen-age
girl and chopping off her arms with an ax.
   He was sentenced to 14 years in prison but was released on
parole last year. He spent the last 10 months of his parole in a
mobile home on the grounds of San Quentin after a statewide outcry
in California against allowing him to leave the prison.
   Smith told KOIN-TV of Portland Thursday that he had spoken to
Singleton by telephone.
   ``As we talked tonight, he realized there will be persecution,''
Smith said. ``But our home is open. He's got to live somewhere.
Society wants to kill him. We just want to help him.''
   Smith said Singleton did not set a date for moving to Azalea.
   The church has 12 properties in this rural community, Smith
said. About 65 church members live there. The sect moved to Oregon
from Las Vegas, Nev., in 1984.
   Smith said he also owns several businesses, including the Alpha
Cabinet Manufacturing Plant in Canyonville, and the Alpha
Construction Co. in Portland.
   Singleton's victim, Mary Vincent, announced earlier this week
that her attorney has filed a $2.4 million Nevada lawsuit judgment
against Singleton in California. The filing automatically allowed
her to seek enforcement of the judgment in California.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Red Army, linked to a bomb attack in Italy and
an explosives arrest in New Jersey, is a radical Japanese terrorist
organization that has been relatively inactive in recent years.
   The army is a splinter faction of the leftist General Federation
of Japanese Students, which claimed support from 850,000 of the 1.3
million college students in Japan in the 1960s.
   The Red Army apparently has not been involved in many attacks
recently, although Japanese police went on alert last November when
Osamu Maruoka, 37, a long-sought army leader, was arrested in Tokyo
and found to have a one-way ticket to Seoul.
   Police theorized he had planned to disrupte South Korea's
presidential elections in December.
   The Red Army was believed never to have grown beyond 300
members. Police action and internal feuding, climaxing with the
killing of 14 members at a mountain hideout in 1971, sapped its
strength.
   The group advocates ``simultaneous world revolution'' and is
believed to have members allied with pro-Palestinian groups in
Lebanon.
   In Naples, Italy, police said Friday that a member of the group
was the prime suspect in a car bombing Thursday outside a U.S.
military club that killed an American servicewoman and four
Italians. Seventeen people were injured.
   Investigators said they were searching for Junzo Okudaira, 39,
who also is suspected in rocket and bomb attacks on the U.S. and
British embassies in Rome last June.
   In New Jersey, authorities Tuesday arrested a Japanese man after
he was found with three bombs in his car. Yu Kikumura, 35, is being
held on federal charges of possessing a fraudulent visa and
illegally possessing unregistered firearms, the explosives.
   The Kyodo news service reported that Kikumura was believed to
have established links to the Red Army in 1974 in Greece.
   The Red Army gained notoriety from a series of terrorist attacks
in the 1970s, including one at Tel Aviv's Lod Airport in 1972 in
which 28 people were killed. The army was also held responsible for
the hijacking of a Japan Airlines flight in 1977 shortly after it
left India.
   Gunmen diverted the flight to Bangladesh. Once in Dhaka, the
terrorists demanded the release of six prisoners, including
Okudaira, from Japanese jails.
   They fled to Algeria after Japan released the prisoners and $6
million in ransom in exchange for the plane passengers.

   An opposition leader and 11 colleagues
will go on trial Monday on charges of inciting riots after losing
Feb. 28 national elections.
   Abdoulaye Wade and 11 members of his Senegalese Democratic Party
will be tried for compromising state security and inciting violence
in the three days following the elections, said a court official
who declined to be identified.
   A state of emergency was imposed in the Dakar area as gangs of
youths fought police, damaged buildings and burned cars. President
Abdou Diouf later defended Wade's arrest, saying he had tried to
``sow disorder and violence.''
   Diouf was re-elected to a second, elected term with 73.5 percent
of the vote. Wade, his closest challenger, took 25 percent of the
vote.
   Wade and other opposition leaders claimed the voting was rigged.
   The Dakar region remains under state of emergency laws, and a
nighttime curfew remains in effect.

   The Turkish Cypriot administration said
Friday it has started requiring Cypriots to carry passports if they
cross the Green Line that divides this Mediterranean island.
   The new requirement became known when opposition Republican
Turkish Party leader Ozker Ozgur was turned back from the
checkpoint Thursday by Turkish Cypriot officials for not carrying a
passport.
   Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, said the decision was
in response to Greek Cypriot President George Vassiliou's statement
that there are no borders in Cyprus.
   The decision is mainly symbolic since few people make the
crossing through the checkpoint near the Ledra Palace Hotel.
Diplomats and United Nations peacekeeping forces will be able to
cross as in the past, they said.
   In the past, Cypriots making the crossing required only
permission from both administrations.
   Greek Cypriots carry passports issued by the Republic of Cyprus,
the only internationally recognized government on the island.
Turkish Cypriots have been issued Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus passports by the Turkish Cypriot administration.
   The Turkish Cypriots make up about 18 percent of the 650,000
population of the island, divided since the Turkish invasion of
1974 into two zones.

   Robert Chambers, apologizing for the first time
to the family of Jennifer Levin, was sentenced today to five to 15
years in jail for strangling the 18-year-old in Central Park.
   The sentence was agreed to three weeks earlier when Chambers
pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter, abruptly ending the
celebrated ``preppie murder'' trial in the ninth day of jury
deliberations after a three-month trial.
   ``The Levin family has gone through hell because of my
actions,'' Chambers said in his first public apology for killing
Miss Levin. ``Whoever said time heals all wounds is all wrong.''
   Chambers stood silently while state Supreme Court Justice Howard
E. Bell handed down the predetermined sentence in a crowded
Manhattan courtroom. As he did while pleading guilty, the defendant
shook his head ``no'' several times during the session, including
once when Bell repeated his guilty plea to manslaughter.
   ``Jennifer's looking down, looking and wondering why this all
happened. I don't know,'' Chambers said later during his brief
statement. ``I never wanted any of this to happen. I wish to
apologize to her family and all her friends.''
   Chambers also apologized to his family and friends, and thanked
more than 150 supporters for letters he has received since being
jailed after his guilty plea.
   The Chambers case spotlighted the world of wealthy Upper East
Side youths and the underaged drinking, drugs and sex of their
lifestyles.
   Among those in the courtroom for the sentencing were several
Chambers trial jurors and several members of the Levin family.
Steven Levin, the slain girl's father, was not permitted to speak
at the hearing as he had requested.
   At the time of the plea, the jury was divided after several
votes on the charge of second-degree murder, the stiffest Chambers
faced, and sent notes to the judge saying they were at an impasse.
   The sentence followed a hearing before Bell in which Chambers'
attorney, Jack Litman, complained that the probation report on his
client was ``slanted'' and asked for an opportunity to answer
charges made by the prosecution in the report.
   Bell granted Litman's request, telling the attorney to put his
comments in writing. The sentencing was delayed for about an hour
while Bell read Litman's response to the probation report.
   Chambers, 21, agreed to the first-degree manslaughter plea in a
deal with the district attorney as a jury deliberated second-degree
murder charges against him, abandoning his story of an accidental
death during ``rough sex'' in the park.
   The agreement was reached after two days of deliberations
between prosecutors and Chambers' attorneys, and approved by the
Levin family. A manslaughter conviction carries a maximum term of
eight and one-third to 25 years.
   By pleading guilty to first-degree manslaughter in Miss Levin's
strangulation, Chambers admitted he intended to hurt the teen
during an encounter in Central Park on Aug. 26, 1986, and ended up
killing her.
   Miss Levin's bruised and nearly naked body was found beneath a
tree behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art early on the morning of
Aug. 26. The couple had run into each other earlier at a popular
Upper East Side ``preppie'' bar.
   Chambers' plea bargain also took care of three burglary charges
against him.

<TEXT>
   Deng Xiaoping has urged the People's Liberation
Army to reinstate the use of military ranks abolished by Mao
Tse-tung more than 20 years ago, it was reported Friday.
   The official China Daily said Deng, who heads the state and
party central military commissions, made the proposal Wednesday at
the first meeting of the newly formed Standing Committee of the 7th
National People's Congress.
   Deng also proposed awarding medals of honor to retired veterans
of the PLA and confirming military ranks conferred between 1955 and
1965.
   The reintroduction of ranks has been discussed for several
years, but it was believed to be the first time Deng has stated his
support for the idea.
   Mao abolished ranks and medals in the early 1960s to further his
concept of an egalitarian, proletariat military force.
   Deng has worked to create a leaner, more efficient and
modernized fighting force. In 1985 he began a two-year program to
reduce the army from 4 million to 3 million members.

   Soviet troops begin pulling out of Afghanistan in
30 days under an international pact signed here to end their
8-year-old intervention in that war-ravaged country. Prospects for
Afghan peace remained dim, however.
   The Soviet Union, United States, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed
the international accord during a brief ceremony Thursday in
Geneva's United Nations building, where U.N.-mediated peace talks
began six years ago.
   In Moscow today, the Soviets accused the United States of trying
to ruin the agreement by continuing to supply weapons to the Moslem
rebels fighting the Kabul government.
   ``Washington is confirming its policy of neoglobalism, a course
of export of counter-revolution,'' the Tass news agency said in the
first official Soviet press commentary issued since the signing of
the pact.
   Tass said the United States was insisting the Soviet Union stop
its military aid to Afghanistan's Marxist government.
   The United States and Soviet Union both reserved the right to
continue providing military assistance to the warring sides.
   ``History has been made today,'' U.S. Secretary of State George
P. Shultz said at a news conference following the signing of the
accords, which go into effect May 15.
   The deposed king of Afghanistan, Mohammad Zaher Shah, proposed
convening a ``loya jitga,'' or grand assembly of Afghan tribal
leaders, to try to set up a transitional government.
   Zaher Shah made the comment Thursday in Italy, where he has
lived since being dethroned in 1973. He has been mentioned by
various parties as possibly returning to play a role in an interim
government.
   Today, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees urged the safe
and voluntary return of the more than 5 million Afghan refugees who
have fled to Pakistan and Iran.
   The United Nations expects to spend hundreds of millions of
dollars supervising the return, the largest repatriation effort
ever. U.N. officials will present a detailed first-year plan within
10 days, refugee commissioner Jean-Pierre Hocke told a news
conference.
   In addition to providing for the Soviet troop pullout, the
accord also pledges non-interference by Pakistan and Afghanistan in
each other's affairs.
   Shultz said the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan,
where they have been supporting the Marxist government of President
Najib against Moslem rebels since December 1979, would remove the
cause of the ``brutal war.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told a separate news
conference that the agreements ``put an end to outside interference
in Afghanistan's affairs and make it possible for the Afghan people
to establish peace and harmony in their land.''
   Others disagreed.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan President Zia ul-Haq said: ``I see
trouble and turmoil in Afghanistan through the insurgency, through
the Mujahedeen (guerrillas) trying to achieve their objective to
overthrow this regime and establish their own authority.''
   He said ``that will mean more loss of life.''
   The guerrillas' seven-party alliance rejected the Geneva accords
and vowed to keep fighting to topple the Kabul government. No
resistance members attended Thursday's ceremony. Pakistan, where
the rebels are based, represented them at negotiations.
   Shultz expressed some annoyance at a suggestion during his news
conference that the accords were flawed because they didn't stop
the fighting.
   The agreements, he said, ``are not perfect. Everybody can find
something wrong with them, but we're practical people trying to
achieve important ends.''
   He also brushed aside comments by Shevardnadze in his news
conference that continued U.S. aid to the resistance forces would
violate international law.
   ``It would surprise me if they challenged our right to
resupply,'' Shultz told reporters aboard his Air Force jet on the
return flight to Washington.
   He noted that a decision by the United States to keep helping
the guerrillas and by the Soviet Union to continue aiding the Kabul
government had been thoroughly aired during the weeks before the
signing.
   Under the pact's provisions, the estimated 115,000 Soviet
soldiers will be out in nine months, with half leaving in the first
three months after May 15. The Soviets have indicated they may
complete the pullout by the end of this year.
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez was given a mandate to continue
promoting a political dialogue between the Kabul government and the
rebels.
   The agreement does not deal with the question of Afghanistan's
future government.

   Passengers fainted and some oxygen
masks didn't work after a Piedmont jetliner engine exploded at
31,000 feet, its turbine blades puncturing the pressurized cabin,
authorities said.
   The twin-engine Fokker F-28, carrying 56 passengers and a crew
of four, made an emergency landing at 10 a.m. Thursday at
Charleston's Yeager Airport. Two flight attendants were treated for
minor injuries.
   The explosion shot engine debris through the rear of the cabin,
ripping a 6-foot gash in the plane's right side and a 2-foot hole
in the left side, narrowly missing the other engine.
   ``It began with a wearing noise and loud vibrations about five
or 10 times straight, and then there was an explosion in the back
of us,'' passenger Rafael Gonzalez of Charlotte, N.C. said.
   A National Transportation Safety Board investigator returned to
Washington today after inspecting the plane Thursday afternoon and
evening. Piedmont crews dispatched to Charleston were given control
of the plane today.
   Gonzalez, who was sitting three rows from the rear of the plane
when the cabin depressurized, said a woman traveling with two
children passed out in the seat behind him.
   ``She fainted. I turned around and she was blue. The baby was
blue. And her 3-year-old was blue,'' Gonzalez said. ``I grabbed her
and put a mask on her, gave the baby to a woman who was sitting
next to her and I took the 3-year-old up with me.''
   Flight 486 was en route from Charlotte, N.C., to Columbus, Ohio,
when the right jet turbine exploded about 9:45 a.m., Piedmont
officials said.
   ``It blew a big hole in the plane,'' passenger Fred Hinton of
Raleigh, N.C., said. ``I'm 240 pounds, and it was big enough that I
could crawl through it. One of the turbine blades came right
through the bathroom. We're lucky no one was in it.''
   The plane lost cabin pressure and went into a dive. Oxygen masks
dropped from the ceiling and flight attendants and adult passengers
went through the aisles and assisted children, passengers said.
   But some didn't work and passengers moved to other seats. After
the plane landed safely, several passengers later complained of
headaches, earaches and elevated blood pressure.
   ``This could have easily been more serious than it was,'' said
Dan Huffman, assistant airport manager.
   Most passengers were placed on a connecting flight, but a
handful rented cars and said they would continue the trip by ground.
   Piedmont spokesman Don McGuire said he didn't know when the
plane's engines had been checked last. The engine was manufactured
by Rolls Royce.
   Computers are used to maintain parts aboard the plane, including
engines and oxygen masks, he said. The reported failures of the
oxygen masks will be investigated, he said.
   Piedmont owns 25 Fokker F-28 4000 Series aircraft, which seat a
maximum of 72 passengers. It also owns 20 1000 Series craft, which
carry 62. It was the first serious problem reported with the
Dutch-made F-28s in the four years Piedmont has owned them, McGuire
said.
   The NTSB's Office of Safety Programs has on file only two
injury-related accidents involving Fokker F-28s, spokesman Ted
Lopatkiewicz said. One jet was involved in a minor taxiway
collision at LaGuardia Airport in New York on Oct. 24, 1985, and on
Dec. 30, 1986, an unassisted handicapped passenger fell off the
boarding stairs when a guardrail gave way, he said.

   A big jump in wholesale prices dealt another
blow today to financial markets still reeling from an unexpected
rise in the trade deficit, pushing stocks down further after
Thursday's $100 billion selloff.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off 4.31
points at 2,001.33 at 12:30 p.m. EDT. Declining issues outnumbered
advancing ones 7 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in
the session, the average was down by more than 20 points.
   The average took a 101.46-point plunge Thursday, which was
triggered by a report from the Commerce Department that the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit rose to $13.8 billion in February.
   The rise of 0.6 percent in wholesale prices in March reported by
the Labor Department today was the biggest in 11 months and
heightened concerns that the economy was becoming overheated.
   ``It's part of the whole inflationary thesis: the weak dollar,
rising imports and strengthening prices all spell difficulty for
the economy later on,'' said Michael Metz, an investment strategist
at Oppenheimer & Co.
   But Metz, noting the big decline in the markets on Thursday,
said, ``I think that we've paid for this bad news in the last day
and a half already.'' Long-term Treasury bond prices also fell
again today, putting interest rates at a three-month high. But the
dollar held about even today after falling sharply Thursday.
   Overnight on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average
of 225 selected issues lost 217.78 points to end the day at
26,893.57, a decline of less than 1 percent.
   In London, stock prices edged narrowly lower. The Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 8.6 points, or 0.5
percent, to 1,778.6. It had been off 24.1 points at the opening.
   In today's report, the Labor Department said the March rise in
wholesale prices of 0.6 percent followed a 0.2 percent drop in
February.
   Many analysts had been looking for an increase in March on the
order of a 0.2 percent rise. If the March rate held for 12 months,
the full-year wholesale inflation rate would be 7 percent, compared
with 2.2 percent for all of 1987.
   In midday trading in New York today, the dollar was bid at 123.8
Japanese yen and 1.66 West German marks. The benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond was off about { point, or about $5 for every $1,000
in face value, as its yield edged up to 8.93 percent from 8.86
percent late Thursday.
   In foreign exchange Thursday, the dollar fell about 2 percent
against the Japanese yen and West German mark despite central bank
purchases aimed at bolstering the dollar, and bond market interest
rates rose to their highest levels since January.
   The trade report raised concerns that the dollar would remain
under pressure despite a months-old agreement by major
industrialized nations to support it. That agreement was reaffirmed
Wednesday by the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Canada and Italy at a meeting in Washington.
   Investors worried that the Federal Reserve might try to support
the falling currency by pushing interest rates higher.
   On Wall Street, declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones
nearly 11 to 1 in the worst day since the widely-followed Dow Jones
average fell 140.58 points on Jan. 8.
   The Dow industrials had climbed nearly 130 points from April 5
through Tuesday, largely on anticipation that February's trade news
would be favorable.
   The value of U.S. stocks fell by $99.7 billion in Thursday's
plunge, according to a 5,000-stock index measured by Wilshire
Associates of Santa Monica, Calif.
   In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury Department's
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond jumped to roughly 8.86 percent
Thursday, the highest since January, from 8.73 percent late
Wednesday.
   The trade report also battered major foreign markets. In London,
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 1.3 percent
on Thursday.
   Some economists called the markets' fears an overreaction.
   ``The quality (precision) of the numbers obviously leaves
something to be desired,'' said Raymond Worseck, economist at A.G.
Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   The trade report indicated consumers were continuing to spend
strongly, sucking up imports, Worseck said.
   The trade deficit was the highest since the record gap of $17.6
billion in October. It was up from January's $12.4 billion gap, but
was down from a deficit of $14.4 billion in February 1987.
   ``It's just one of those glitches that keep the financial
markets interesting. The trend is still for improvement in the
trade deficit,'' said James Solloway, director of economic research
at Argus Research Corp. in St. Louis.

<TEXT>
   The sun shines on rustling palms, the
airport bustles with the world's business, and on the isolated
``plane of martyrdom'' three dozen people wait for their captors to
kill them or set them free.
   The blue-and-white Kuwait Airlines Boeing 747, hijacked April 5,
faces north toward the main terminal and control tower about 400
yards away.
   From the cockpit, crew members talk with the tower about air
conditioner maintenance, delivery of food and other routine matters.
   Police presence is discreet. Four small armored cars encircle
the plane, but no soldiers are in sight.
   Algerian officials, proud of their country's ability to deal
with both revolutionaries and conservative governments, note
repeatedly that the gunmen have promised to refrain from violence
while here and say an assault on the plane is out of the question.
   The hijackers killed two passengers during five days spent on
the ground at Larnaca, Cyprus.
   At least 200 reporters and photographers patrol the sunbaked
lawn between the terminal and the VIP lounge and fight for the
scarce, unreliable telephones that were installed after the plane
arrived early Wednesday.
   From the lawn, shaded by tents erected Wednesday night by
blue-uniformed soldiers, journalists peer at the plane through
binoculars and telephoto lenses.
   Now and then, Algerian officials climb the stairway and are
allowed to enter the jumbo jet for 15 to 30 minutes of continuing,
but episodic, negotiations with the hijackers.
   Talks between Algerian mediators and a Kuwaiti delegation take
place elsewhere, presumably in government offices downtown.
   Passenger jets land every 10 or 20 minutes and taxi past the
hijacked plane to discharge passengers into the crowded terminal,
which is dusty from construction that has closed its self-service
restaurant.
   Airport workers and taxi drivers show intense interest and press
journalists for information about the standoff with the hijackers,
who demand freedom for 17 pro-Iran extremists convicted of bombing
the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in 1983.
   On Wednesdy night the drama heightened.
   Two buses pulled up to the plane, official cars raced across the
tarmac, the Kuwaiti delegation stood expectantly in what looked
like a receiving line and the moving stairway approached the
plane's front door.
   The control tower radioed the cockpit to say an official was
ready to enter. The response: ``We are praying.''
   An Algerian official entered. Rumors flew. He left. The Kuwaiti
receiving line disbanded, reformed, then disappeared. Hours ticked
away toward midnight, and it seemed that whatever had been on was
off. There was no official explanation.
   Suddenly a hijacker was helping a hostage hobble down the
stairs. Less than a minute later the Kuwaiti businessman was being
guided into a portion of the VIP lounge barred to reporters. His
10-day ordeal was over.
   Soon afterward, radio scanners recorded a statement from the
hijackers describing themselves as ``men of principle'' and
restating their demand for the release of the 17 prisoners in
Kuwait ``even if the price we have to pay is very high.''

<HEAD>American Companies Say Law May Force Some to Close</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American companies here say they're
caught in the middle of President Reagan's new economic sanctions
and may have to close if they're not allowed to resume payments to
Panama's government.
   Eastman Kodak Co. gave its workforce in Panama a 15-day paid
furlough because of the problems in doing business, a company
spokesman said Friday.
   Another company has given its employees ``collective vacations''
since Reagan froze all U.S. payments to the Panamian government on
April 8, in an attempt to force Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to
relinquish power.
   A source familiar with the company's situation said it would not
reopen until conditions are such that it can pay taxes in Panama.
   The U.S. order prohibits direct or indirect payments, including
income taxes, by Americans and U.S. corporations to the Panamanian
government. It also applies to Panamanian corporations owned or
directed by Americans. Violators can be sentenced to up to 10 years
in prison and fined $50,000.
   Companies have been told that until any exemptions are
announced, the order is being enforced to its fullest extent _
right down to the $30 departure tax charged at the airport to
people leaving the country.
   ``You can't move, you can't do anything without breaking the
law,'' the head of one company said.
   ``The executive order puts a gun against my head and the
(Panamanian) government has a gun against my head, and I'm just
ducking,'' he said.
   All the executives spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Several company representatives said they were complying with
the order and continued to operate, but they noted they did not yet
have tax or other payments due the government.
   Commerce and Industries Minister Mario Rognoni has said the
government will be flexible with U.S. firms. But if electricity,
water and telephone bills are not paid, the utilities services run
by the government will be cut off.
   ``We weren't ordered to close, but it just doesn't make sense to
stay open,'' said Kodak spokesman Henry Kaska in Rochester, N.Y.
``We are not permitted to pay our utility bill. We can't pay the
phone bill.''
   One executive said the ability of American manufacturers to
continue operating also would depend on whether they have enough
raw materials in stock, since importing also requires payments to
the government.
   ``We're hoping there will exceptions for essential items,'' a
food company executive said.
   ``We have tax payments to the government but cannot pay them,''
he added. ``We're caught in the middle.''
   ``Sooner or later, the executive order is going to shut
everybody down. The executive order will totally kill U.S. business
in Panama,'' he said.
   He said some companies paid high taxes the first three quarters,
but owed less for the year because of the economic crisis and now
have credits, allowing them to postpone a payment decision.
   An American trade association representative said the law was
hurting U.S. companies more than its target, Noriega.
   ``In essence it's closing down U.S. companies and sending
Americans home and not affecting Mr. Noriega at all. I expect some
leeway will have to be allowed,'' he said.
   ``Really you're a hostage here in Panama,'' he said, referring
to the airport tax.
   Panamanian residents also may not leave the country without
showing what amounts to an income tax receipt.
   American businesses are worried about the progressive penalties
the Panamanian government may charge if it decides to let the
companies pay taxes late.
   Most executives said they would comply with the sanctions, but a
number were said to be looking for ways to get around it.
   Nicolas Psychoyos said he and his father, both American
citizens, have taken leaves of absence from the Panamanian-owned
supermarket chain they headed.
   ``Non-Americans will run the company for a while. From all they
said, this is all we can do,'' he said. ``I think most companies
are evaluating now whether they want to be thrown in jail in Panama
or in the United States.''
   Psychoyos said the supermarket chain will continue payments to
the government.
   ``We've got to abide by the laws. We've been here 80 years and
we hope to be another 80,'' he said.
   Under the order, companies are to make their normal payments to
an escrow account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
established for Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was ousted from the
presidency by Noriega on Feb. 26 after trying to fire the general.

   President Reagan has nominated Maj. Gen. John
M. Loh for promotion to lieutenant general and assignment as
commander of the Air Force Aeronautical Systems Division, the
Pentagon said Friday.
   Assuming he is confirmed by the Senate, the 50-year-old Loh will
replace Gen. William E. Thurman, who will retire Aug. 1 after 34
years of active-duty service. Thurman, 56, of Hodgenville, Ky., has
headed the Aeronautical Systems Division since June 1986.
   Loh, a native of Washington, D.C., now is vice commander of the
division, which is part of the Air Force Systems Command and
responsible for developing and buying new aircraft.

   The head of two mail-order firms has agreed to
pay a $300,000 civil penalty to settle charges that he violated
federal rules, the Federal Trade Commission announced Friday.
   The payment settled charges against Philip Goutell, president of
Frank E. Bush Inc. and Conceptual Trends Inc. of New York, the FTC
said.
   The Trade Commission had charged that Goutell's companies, and
others, misrepresented products they offered for sale, failed to
deliver merchandise on time, failed to notify consumers of their
right to cancel delayed orders and failed to cancel orders or make
refunds to consumers.
   Under terms of the settlement the companies also agreed not to
make misleading claims about products offered for sale, including
cookware, kitchen products, binoculars, kerosene lamps and pills
claimed to remedy male impotence.
   Seven other firms and three individuals also were named in the
original FTC suit. The others settled the charges against them last
August.

   The Navy's newest Trident nuclear submarine
will be launched later this month in Groton, Conn., the service
said Friday.
   The ballistic missile submarine Pennsylvania will slide into the
water during ceremonies April 23 at the General Dynamic Corp.'s
Electric Boat Division shipyards, the Navy said.
   Rep. Joseph McDade, R-Pa., will be principal speaker during the
ceremonies. The nuclear-powered sub will be the fourth U.S. Navy
warship to be named for the state of Pennsylvania.
   The Pennsylvania is 560 feet long, 42 feet wide and will
displace about 18,700 tons when submerged. The first such
submarine, the Ohio, was commissioned in 1981.
   The Pennsylvania will be the second sub in the line built to
accommodate a new, more accurate version of the Trident
intercontinental nuclear missile known as the D-5.

   In a world fascinated by computers and
semiconductors, there's still a place for the serious consideration
of abominable snowmen, frog showers and reincarnation.
   It can be found in a little-known magazine named for an American
journalist who researched the inexplicable ``just to knock holes in
the smug orthodoxy of the scientists of his age,'' said Paul
Seiveking, a co-editor.
   Fortean Times, published in London, caters to readers who think
there just might be something to the hollow Earth theory, crying
statues and close encounters of any kind.
   The odd, little periodical keeps its subscribers up to date with
the latest on human horns, winged cats, giant squids and, of
course, UFOs and the Loch Ness Monster.
   Fortean Times is ``a bulletin about what is peculiar in the
world,'' Seiveking says.
   Its name and philosophy come from Charles Fort, an iconoclastic
American journalist who died in 1932. He spent his later years at
the British Museum Library in London and the New York Public
Library, researching the inexplicable.
   Being a Fortean means believing ``there's a continuum between
subjective and objective experience, between dream and hard fact,''
Seiveking said.
   More importantly, however, it means ``conditional acceptance''
of things that ``orthodox explanation can't account for'' _ at
least until further evidence comes along.
   Seiveking and co-editor Bob Rickard, who founded Fortean Times
15 years ago, put the magazine together at home in their spare
time, and try their best to publish it quarterly.
   Their material comes from a dedicated Fortean cadre of about 60
correspondents, mostly unpaid, who scour the world's newspapers and
other media for weird and wonderful tales to fill the magazine's 80
or so pages.
   Every month, the editors meet to classify the material their
correspondents have gathered into about 35 main categories, ``like
phantom smells, strange sounds, lights, stuff falling from the
sky,'' Seiveking said.
   ``There's a lot of laughter in what we do,'' he admitted during
a break from his regular job as an editor for a London reference
book publisher.
   But he said the job also has a serious side.
   ``We're trying to broaden people's horizons. We see ourselves as
chroniclers, as sort of scientists as well as being entertainers.''
   A recent issue featured purportedly new photographs of the Yeti,
the mysterious abominable snowman of the Himalayas, as well as
items about giant whirlpools in the seas off Norway and fireballs
in Jerusalem, and a ``reincarnation round-up.''
   Finding a Fortean Times subscriber may be only a little easier
than tracking down the Yeti. Just 2,500 of them are scattered in 36
countries, including 500 in the United States. At $3 a copy, the
magazine just about breaks even.
   Regular readers, said Seiveking, include ``little old ladies who
are spiritualists, people in the United Nations, professors,
science fiction writers, journalists in obscure little countries
who like to keep up with this kind of thing.''
   They're a small, but faithful band who don't let a few facts get
in the way of a good time.
   ``While the real nature of the `Cottingly Fairy' photographs is
now apparent,'' one Australian reader recently wrote in a letter to
the editor, ``surely the Fortean reaction will be that they are
only relative fakes. For, in the spectrum of bogus-genuine, there
must somewhere (in this or another world) exist photographs of real
fairies.''
   Not quite believing while not quite disbelieving always gives
Forteans an out. It allowed the author of a recent piece on the
luminous magnetic cloud supposedly encountered by a British
steamship in 1904 to conclude: ``Although I remain disturbed by the
suspicious aspects of the story, I am slightly inclined to think
that the story is true.''
   As long as there are mysterious lights in the sky and things
that go bump in the night, Seiveking and Rickard hope to keep
publishing their ``journal of strange phenomena.''

<TEXT>
   An ancient mummy found in a pawnshop is
likely the body of a man who died at the age of 35 and would have
had a longer and more comfortable life in the age of antibiotics,
university scientists say.
   Memphis State University paid a Detroit pawnbroker $40,000 for
the 2,300-year-old mummy two years ago and asked the University of
Tennessee, Memphis, to run a battery of tests.
   The medical school set up a ``mummy team'' in 1985 to conduct
similar tests on an ancient head acquired by Memphis State's
Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology.
   The team tested tissue and hair samples and took hundreds of
X-rays, and announced Thursday that the Egyptian apparently died of
a brain abscess caused by an ear infection.
   Hugh Berryman, a forensic anthropologist, said the man was 5
feet tall, probably right-handed and had thinning brown hair, and
also suffered from serious tooth infections.
   James Langston, a radiologist with the medical school, said the
Egyptian had an infection that ate through a bone near his left
inner ear and may have led to a fatal brain abscess.
   ``That's a reasonable cause of death,'' he said. ``We only have
the bone for speculation because we don't have the brain.''
   Rita Freed, an Egyptologist from Memphis State, said the mummy
was named Iret-Irew, according to inscriptions on its coffin.
   The mummy was brought to the United States in the 1920s. It was
kept at a museum in Chicago until 1976, when it was sold to an
antique dealer. It eventually was bought by the pawnbroker who
later sold it to Memphis State, Ms. Freed said.

   Some 78,000 pounds of illegally imported fish
is being donated to food banks in California, the National Marine
Fisheries Service reported Friday.
   The frozen salmon was seized last year after being imported from
Japan and then relabeled as a product of the United States, the
agency said.
   After inspecting the salmon and clearing it for human
consumption, the agency decided to donate it for use in shelters,
day-care centers, soup kitchens and senior centers.
   About 26,000 pounds of salmon will go to the Los Angeles
Regional Food Bank and 52,000 pounds will be divided by the San
Francisco and Santa Clara County food banks.
   The salmon was seized at cold storage plants in Oakland,
Riverside and Watsonville.
   About 200,000 pounds of fish confiscated in Bellingham, Wash.,
was sold earlier under a court order, officials said.

   The queen of the sky will nestle near a
sparkling crescent Moon in the next few days, offering skywatchers
a special sight.
   The dazzling white point of light that marks the planet Venus
will shine near the emerging Moon, astronomers report.
   ``It'll be a particularly nice scene, and folks will notice
it,'' said Gail Cleere of the U.S. Naval Observatory here.
   The peak will come on Tuesday night just after twilight, but the
celestial couple will also shine together on Sunday and Monday
nights, reports Sky & Telescope magazine.
   The Moon will be just three days old on Tuesday, so it will be a
pretty crescent, Cleere said. ``We gets hundreds of calls'' when
instances like this occur.
   The New Moon occurs on Saturday, meaning that the Earth's
natural satellite will be invisible. But on the following days
light will begin to brighten the edge, creating the familier
crescent Moon.
   Venus, meanwhile, will be located in almost the same part of the
sky and will be the brightest object visible other than the Moon.
   While Venus and the Moon will appear close together in the sky,
that's only because they are located along the same line of sight.
Venus is about 54 million miles away, 225 times farther than the
Moon.

<HEAD>Dukakis Criticizes Administration on Anti-Drug Spending</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 2 grafs for 7th graf pvs, Massachusetts Gov., with
Dukakis speaking informally rather than delivering speech quoted in
story</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis blasted President
Reagan and Vice President George Bush today for having supported a
``dope-peddling'' dictator in Panama. Republican Bush said one
reason Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega has lasted so
long is that he has been getting money from Libya.
   All three Democratic candidates campaigned in New York today,
four days before the state's primary, with Jesse Jackson ridiculing
his rivals as latecomers in the fight against illegal drugs and
Albert Gore Jr. saying troubles at Eastern Airlines reflected
hands-off, greed-promoting values encouraged by the Reagan
administration.
   New polls confirmed Dukakis' lead among New York Democrats, with
Jackson running second and Gore a poor third.
   Bush, speaking in Washington to the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, said, ``Noriega should go and Noriega will go.''
   He said he did not know about Noriega's alleged involvement in
drug trafficking until the Panamanian leader was indicted in this
country. Citing ``several reliable sources,'' he said Noriega has
been able to stay in power despite U.S. sanctions at least partly
because he has been receiving millions of dollars from Libya.
   Speaking before the same forum, former television evangelist Pat
Robertson said he still hoped his supporters could play a key role
in the Republican convention in August. But he ackowledged,
``George Bush will probably have things his own way.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis made strong anti-drug remarks to
students today at a junior high school in Brooklyn.
   He spoke informally rather than giving the prepared remarks that
aides had distributed to reporters. In those remarks, he asked
rhetorically, ``Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, what is going
on?
   ``Why do we have the money for Star Wars but not for the war
against drugs? And why did you pay $200,000 a year to a
dope-peddling, gun-running Panamanian dictator?'' _ a reference to
former U.S. support of Noriega.
   Gore spoke to about two dozen members of pilots, mechanics and
flight attendants unions at Eastern Airlines early today, saying
``mismanagement of Eastern and Continental, et cetera, stands as a
symbol of the kind of approach Ronald Reagan and George Bush
encourage with their policies of hands off, let 'em have whatever
kind of labor relations they want, promote greed as the principal
guiding value for corporate America.''
   Cuomo has refused to endorse any of the three Democratic
contenders, saying he will wait until after the last primaries on
June 7.
   Earlier in the week, Jackson met with Cuomo and the governor was
generous in his praise of the former civil rights activist.
   On Thursday, however, Cuomo said Jackson's lack of experience in
elective office could hurt him if he won the nomination.
   ``I could make a better case for him if he had been a public
official,'' Cuomo said.
   Before Cuomo decided to hold off any endorsement, Dukakis had
been considered the odds-on favorite to win the governor's backing.
   The Massachusetts governor also had hoped to get the support of
Koch, but the New York City mayor surprised many observers by
announcing his backing of Gore, whom he described as ``a man of
intellect, courage and integrity.''
   Koch said that on the issue of support of Israel, Gore was
``head and shoulders'' above the other two Democrats.
   The mayor said Jackson was never in contention for his
endorsement, but that he would back him if he became the party
nominee.
   He added however that his support of Jackson would be based
``not because of his positions but because he would be less
destructive of the country than George Bush.''
   Gore needed all the help he could get in New York, which holds
its primary next Tuesday with 255 delegates at stake.
   Dukakis led Jackson by 45 percent to 28 percent in a CBS News
poll, 46 percent to 34 percent in a Marist College poll and 49
percent to 34 percent in an ABC News-Washington Post poll. Gore had
only 8 percent support in two polls and 7 percent in the third.
   ``Gore's numbers are flat across the board,'' said Marist
pollster Lee Miringoff. While things can change before Tuesday's
vote, ``certainly nothing much moved this week except for solidity
to the front-runners.''
   ``I only believe polls that show me way in front,'' Gore
commented after the debate.
   The latest confrontation offered no sign of a breakthrough.
   Gore pressed Dukakis once again on his statement to the New York
Daily News that he would consider use of nuclear weapons in the
event of a Soviet invasion of Europe.
   ``This is a serious mistake'' said Gore, referring to the
Dukakis statement.
   When Gore raised the issue again later in the debate, Dukakis
said: ``Don't pick up the morning newspaper and then have a press
conference. Give me a buzz and I'll tell you exactly what I said
and there'll be much less confusion.''
   When Gore first took Dukakis to task, Dukakis said Gore
misrepresented what Dukakis had told the newspaper. Dukakis said he
was simply restating longstanding U.S. and NATO policy.
   Jackson, however, said there was ``a real danger in those of us
who may very well lead our country to get trapped into a
hypothetical situation on who will shoot your gun first and destroy
the whole world to prove that you got macho.''
   Dukakis widened his delegate lead over Jackson to 112, when 26
House members supporting him were nominated to be among the
so-called super delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
   Jackson picked up 15 delegates in Congress, while Gore got 11. A
total of 251 members of the House and Senate will be delegates to
the convention.

   Cracks are appearing in the underground
Palestinian leadership over how to wage a campaign of resistance
against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The divisions are emerging at a time when the frequency and size
of street clashes is diminishing, and the nature of the
confrontation is changing into more of an economic test of wills.
   There are two basic splits in Palestinian ranks:
   _ The Islamic Resistance Movement is at odds with the mainstream
Palestine Liberation Organization factions on the issue of
convening an international conference to negotiate peace.
   _ The Communists, in a dispute over tactics, have pulled out of
the PLO-affiliated underground command, the United National
Leadership of the Uprising.
   The underground has announced weekly action programs in a series
of leaflets. But starting in early March, there have been multiple
versions, some making conflicting demands on the 1.5 million
residents of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In the latest handbill, No. 13, one version calls for three days
of general strikes to mark ``Prisoners' Day'' while another
version, apparently Communist, called for sit-ins at the Red Cross
offices and other locations.
   ``There are differences on how to act, on tactics, '' conceded
Mohammed Manasra, a journalist with the daily Communist newspaper
Al Taalia.
   As an example, Manasra cited the repeated calls for general
strikes, which he said kept workers away from jobs at a time when
Israel was using economic measures in an effort to put an end to
the uprising.
   ``If Israel is putting economic pressure on people, and we also
put pressure on people, then we are doing what Israel wants,'' said
Manasra, who added workers would ignore strike calls if they became
excessive.
   Instead of general strikes that hurt low-income Palestinians,
Manasra said the Communists supported a boycott of Israeli products.
   According to the Ministry of Labor's government Employment
Service, about half the 110,000 Arabs who hold jobs in Israel went
to work in February and March. Oficials claim the on-the-job figure
has risen recently, although statistics were not available.
   After Palestinians stopped paying taxes, Israeli authorities
imposed financial and trade restrictions and put the West Bank's
8,000 teachers on half-pay for three weeks. The army has also
ordered stores closed when PLO leaflets said they should be open.
   ``Food is very expensive. People are feeling the seriousness of
the economic strikes,'' Farah El-Araj, the pro-Jordanian mayor of
Beit Jallah, said on Israel Radio.
   A second split is between the PLO factions and the Islamic
Resistance Movement, a coalition of fundamentalist groups that has
a large following in the Gaza Strip.
   To counter the increasing Islamic influence, the PLO-affiliated
factions, the Communist Party and the Islamic Jihad formed a
coalition in early January. Called the United National Leadership
of the Uprising, it has followed the policies of PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat in seeking an international peace conference and in
not escalating clashes by using guns and knives.
   The fundmentalists, however, oppose negotiations with Israel and
seek creation of a pan-Islamic, rather than Palestinian, state.
   ``The first phase of the uprising is winding down, and they
(Palestinians) disagree about the second phase, about where to go
from here,'' said Col. Renaan Gissin, deputy army spokesman.
   ``There are feelings of fatigue. The people want to see some
results,'' he added.
   Gissin said another split threatening the unity of the
underground was Islamic Jihad's desire to wage armed struggle, a
policy opposed by PLO groups.
   Despite the disputes, Manasra said the resistance would continue
because local committees rather than the leaflet writers had the
final say on whether to observe calls for strikes and protests.
   For example, he said he doubted whether local committees would
heed the call in the latest leaflet to throw firebombs on April 21,
the so-called ``Day of the Palestinian Molotov.''
   The army spokesman said the overall level of violence had
dropped markedly in recent weeks even though the bloodshed had not
ceased altogether.
   ``The intensity of the clashes is still high, but there are
fewer confrontations and the size of demonstrations is smaller, a
hundred or so instead of thousands,'' said Gissin.
   There have been 7,000 clashes between soldiers and demonstrators
since Dec. 8, killing 146 Arabs and two Israelis. More than 1,000
Arabs have been wounded by gunfire.
   ``I think we are now in an ebbing phase of the uprising. We've
already reached the peak. But when it finally subsides, I don't
think it will go back to the same level it started at four months
ago,'' said Sari Nusseibah, a philosophy professor at the Bir Zeit
University in the West Bank.

<HEAD>Welfare and Property Tax Laws Stir Thatcher Rebellion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's controversial
social welfare legislation is stirring the fiercest opposition she
has encountered since her re-election last June.
   The resistance is coming not just from the opposition, but from
rank-and-file lawmakers within her own Conservative Party, who on
Thursday night staged their biggest back-bench revolt since June.
   Twenty-eight of the 376 Tories in Parliament voted against the
government's decision to end free dental checkups and eye
examinations.
   The sums involved _ $5.60 for the dental checkup _ are small,
but they matter to the poor and they come in the same month as the
top income tax rate is being slashed from 60 to 40 percent.
   And while the number of rebels looks relatively small, any
revolt is significant, given Mrs. Thatcher's strong-willed style of
leadership. Customarily, a lawmaker voting against his government
almost automatiucally destroys his chances of winning government
office.
   The social welfare moves and a controversial reform of property
taxes, another Thatcher brainchild, have combined to arouse deep
unease among sections of the Parliamentary rank-and-file about her
radical third term program.
   ``At the heart of the debate is a fear that the very well-off
make substantial gains which are wholly financed by the less
well-off,'' said Conservative legislator Sir George Young, a
leading rebel.
   ``Playing around with rebates for the poor in no way tackles
that fundamental inequity.''
   Mrs. Thatcher remains determined to wean Britons off what she
calls the ``dependency culture'' and encourage private enterprise.
She points to the economic revival her rigorous policies have
wrought, including the fastest growth rate in Western Europe and
the country's first budget surplus in nearly two decades.
   But there are signs of defensiveness. On Thursday night, the
62-year-old prime minister made a comparatively rare foray into the
House of Commons tea room to rally support for the new property
tax, popularly called the poll tax.
   And the government announced an extension of rebates, costing
about $245 million and affecting 1 million people, in a move to
blunt another rebellion when the poll tax comes up for a key vote
Monday.
   That concession appeared aimed at heading off a major revolt
Monday in the 650-member Commons, where the Conservatives' hefty
102-seat majority was whittled to 81 and 74 in Thursday's votes.
   Under the poll tax, families will be rated according to how many
adults are living in the home. Estimates are that the tax on some
homes will more than double, hitting modest earners hardest.
   ``It will manifestly be perceived to be unfair,'' complained
another Tory legislator, Michael Mates, who hopes to get about 50
colleagues to back an amendment that would base the tax on income
instead of a flat charge.
   Like changes in housing subsidies which force everyone,
including public housing tenants, to pay at least one-fifth of the
property taxes on their homes, the poll tax is fundamental to a
Thatcher onslaught on local councils.
   The local councils, which run local government, are dominated by
Britain's left-wing.
   They levy and spend property taxes and most of the bigger
councils are run by the socialist Labor Party.
   The Guardian newspaper, the nation's foremost liberal daily,
argued that Tory legislators with narrowly held seats are
frightened by Mrs. Thatcher's measures.
   ``Where damaging policy changes were unable to provoke a revolt,
political survival has succeeded,'' it said.
   A straw poll among 100 rank-and-file Tory legislators by another
daily, The Independent, found nearly two-thirds expressing alarm at
the social security changes.
   The government says it is merely refocusing the $86 billion
welfare budget on the most needy. But opposition and welfare groups
estimate that two-thirds of the 8.6 million welfare claimants will
lose funds. The government acknowledges 43 percent will receive
less.
   Polls show the Conservative government is losing support.
Gallup's March poll showed the Conservatives 5.5 points ahead of
Labor, down from 10 the previous month. Two-thirds of the 1,094
voters questioned said they thought the tax-cutting budget
announced March 15 was ``not fair.''
   The Conservatives received 42 percent support _ enough for
another victory _with Labor getting 36.5 percent and the rest split
among two center parties and minority regional parties.

   Production at the nation's factories, mines
and utilities edged up a sluggish 0.1 percent in March, the
government said Friday, somewhat counterbalancing signs that
inflation is reheating.
   The Federal Reserve Board said gains in production of autos and
business equipment offset declines in construction supplies and
consumer goods other than cars.
   The slight March advance followed no change in February and,
according to economists, is an indication that the pickup in
wholesale prices may not be sustainable.
   ``It isn't the type of boom production environment that would
support rapid gains in inflation,'' said Maury Harris, chief
economist at PaineWebber in New York.
   The Labor Department, in a separate report Friday, said
wholesale inflation was running at a 7 percent annual rate in
March. That news sent jitters through the financial markets and
pushed interest rates higher.
   ``Ironically, a fairly low growth rate in industrial production
is good in one sense ... It may actually allay suspicions that the
economy may be on the verge of overheating,'' said Gordon Richards,
an economist with the National Association of Manufacturers.
   Before February, production had been increasing at a steady
pace: 0.5 percent in November and December and 0.4 percent in
January. The last decline was in September, when production fell
0.2 percent. Production had shot up 1.1 percent in October.
   Despite two months of lackluster growth, production levels in
March were a strong 5.6 percent above levels a year ago.
   The March rise included a 0.2 percent jump in production at
manufacturing plants after a flat performance in February. That
included a 2.6 percent increase in auto production, which followed
a 0.8 percent drop in February, and a 0.6 percent boost in
production of equipment used by businesses, the fourth consecutive
gain.
   Factories making durable goods, items expected to last three or
more years, saw output rise 0.3 percent last month; output at
plants making non-durable goods was unchanged for the second month
in a row.
   Mining output increased 0.4 percent after a 1.0 percent drop in
February. Output at utilities dropped 1.2 percent after a 0.5
percent increase.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., forecasting firm, said the drop at utility companies was
caused by warmer-than-usual weather in March.
   He predicted that industrial production overall would pick up in
coming months.
   ``We ought to see auto production coming up ... Inventories are
now down to near-normal levels. The drop in utilities should be
over,'' Wyss said.
   The various changes left industrial production at 134.6 percent
of its 1977 base of 100.

<HEAD>Nation's First Case of Electronic Income-Tax Fraud Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities say a Portland man has
been indicted in the nation's first case of income tax fraud
involving electronic filing of tax returns.
   Donald J. Penrod, 42, is accused in a 12-count indictment of
fraudulently applying for tax refunds under false names through a
professional tax-return preparer in Vancouver, Wash. The preparer
was not charged.
   A federal grand jury in Portland returned the indictment
Thursday.
   Penrod borrowed money from financial institutions based on the
fraudulent tax refunds he expected to receive, said Lance Caldwell,
an assistant U.S. attorney for Oregon.
   Electronic filing of federal income-tax returns is available in
16 regions, one of which includes Washington. The program,
initiated by the Internal Revenue Service in 1986, permits
professional tax-return preparers to electronically transmit
returns via computers to IRS offices, Caldwell said.
   The IRS says the program results in faster processing of returns
and lower costs. It is expected to be available nationally by the
mid-1990s.
   Penrod assumed the identities of dead or fictitious people,
Caldwell said. False W-2 forms allegedly were prepared for the tax
returns.

   Lawrence Buzalsky stopped at the Horse
Around Bar to buy a frozen pizza, but he got a taste of history and
a gander at the U.S. Constitution before heading home with his
dinner.
   ``Who built that?'' Buzalsky asked, circling a traveling exhibit
the state put together to celebrate the 200th birthday of the U.S.
Constitution. ``There's a lot of reading.''
   The Horse Around Bar, one of two businesses in this prairie
ranching town, is playing host to the four-sided display through
Monday, because there is no other place for it in the county.
   The wooden exhibit was too large to fit through the doors of
either the nearby Slope County Courthouse or the school, and a
church that could accommodate it was already booked.
   Galan Hanson, who moved to Amidon from Wisconsin four years ago
to open the Horse Around Bar, said he gladly volunteered a large
garage and storage room attached to his saloon for the exhibit.
   Nine people had signed a guest book ``ratifying'' the
Constitution by Thursday afternoon.
   ``Some spend quite a lot of time back there reading the stuff
and some just look it over, in and out,'' Hanson said, sitting near
rows of liquor bottles, sipping coffee. ``In a lot of ways, it is
the conversation piece of the bar. (But) I really don't think it
will bring me any extra business.''
   The North Dakota Constitution Celebration Committee, headed by a
state Supreme Court justice, and the state Department of Public
Instruction created the exhibit and intend to display it in each of
the state's 53 counties.
   It's a mini-museum featuring old pictures, newspaper stories and
brief narratives about segments of North Dakota's history that
relate to individual freedoms and government powers.
   Amidon is in the southwest corner of North Dakota about 125
miles west of Bismarck and boasts that it's the smallest county
seat in the country.
   ``You can say 25 to 30 people live here,'' Slope County Sheriff
Pat Lorge said. ``It depends on what day it is.''
   Judy Bender, one of two teachers at the elementary school, said
all 20 students would go see the historical display Friday.
   It didn't make any difference that the field trip essentially
meant visiting a saloon, she said. ``The kids are used to it. They
frequent it quite often with their parents for supper,'' she said.
   The sheriff, whose office just is across U.S. Highway 85,
examined the exhibit Wednesday night.
   ``They have an old Slope County homestead on it,'' said Lorge,
whose grandfather was sheriff for 18 years. ``I'm not so sure it's
not the old Day place.''
   Hanson moved his pickup from the garage, which used to be a
repair shop for a farm supply store, to make way for the display.
   An old horse harness hangs on pegs on one wall, not far from a
saddle. A wooden-wheeled wagon that Hanson hitches to his
Clydesdales sits nearby. Hanson claims the wagon is at least 75
years old.
   Buzalsky, a rancher, circled the constitutional exhibit with its
red, white and blue ribbons a couple of times before leaning into a
chest freezer to pick out a pizza.
   He didn't have time to read all the history on the display.
   ``I have to get the pizza going,'' he said. ``The women folks
sent me to town to get it.''

<HEAD>`Computer Potato'' Has His Way of Life Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teen-ager Charles Patterson has his way of
life back _ in a bigger and better way.
   The 17-year-old, who was born with gross motor impairment that
limits his physical activity, couldn't afford to replace his
Commodore 64 computer and disk drive when they were stolen from his
home, but got several replacement offers after a story appeared in
a local newspaper.
   On Thursday, Patterson's computer equipment was replaced by a
Ridgeland computer dealer.
   ``Thank you a lot,'' Patterson said repeatedly after the
computer was installed atop the family television set where his old
computer sat.
   ``It's overwhelming,'' said his mother, Florence Weeks, who
earns $700 a month at a taxi company. ``It's marvelous. I don't
have the words to say how I feel. To think of the total strangers
that were willing to help. I didn't know that there were that many
caring people out there.''
   Weeks said their home telephone rang constantly with people who
offered to give Patterson a computer or money.
   After talking with several people, Patterson, a senior at Murrah
High School, accepted a new IBM PC XT computer offered by John P.
Robinson, a 1974 Murrah graduate. Patterson also got a color
display, a modem and assorted software.
   Patterson's stolen computer and disk drive were worth $400;
Robinson's gift was valued at $3,000.
   ``It makes us feel good to help. I hope whoever got your
computer the first time won't come back,'' Robinson said.
   Patterson saved four years' allowance and lunch money to
purchase a computer. Earlier this month, a burglar broke into the
Patterson home and took the computer, a disk drive, $28 in cash and
a small television.
   Weeks said the computer was the first thing her son sought after
getting home from school.
   ``Every available moment he was sitting there,'' said Weeks, who
calls her son a ``computer potato.''
   ``It was his way of communicating with others. He cannot get out
and ride a bicycle or play baseball,'' she said.
   Patterson, a student in the Advanced Performing Arts Complex at
Murrah High School, said he used the computer to do homework and a
science fair project, write short stories and invent games.
   He had planned to use his computer to teach computer basics
during a camp this summer at Mississippi State University. He said
the theft occurred ``just as I was going to really need it the
most.''
   The incident taught him several lessons.
   ``I'm overwhelmed,'' he said. ``I think this was a dual lesson.
That computer was a favorite item in my life. I learned that you
don't get heavily attached to a thing like this. I learned about
the giving of people.''

<HEAD>`Extraordinary' Community Response To Suicides Can Be Appropriate,
CDC Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tragedies of multiple suicides by young
people can provide lessons for other communities to follow in the
future, according to a new report by the national Centers for
Disease Control.
   On March 11, 1987, in Bergenfield, N.J., two young men, 18 and
19, and two young women, 16 and 17, committed suicide by locking
themselves in a garage and sitting inside a car with the motor
running.
   Within days, school officials identified other students they
felt might be at risk, counseling was provided to young people and
a local suicide hotline and a walk-in counseling center were
started.
   The CDC report, as is the agency's custom, did not name the New
Jersey town where the four young people died on that date. But
Bergenfield has been identified in numerous news reports about the
deaths.
   After an investigation, the CDC noted in its weekly report
Thursday that ``when a suicide cluster does occur, an extraordinary
amount of community effort and resources is temporarily devoted to
suicide prevention.''
   ``Such a response ... is appropriate,'' the Atlanta-based health
agency said. ``It is prudent for a community faced with a suicide
cluster to make every effort to anticipate and prevent additional
suicides among susceptible individuals.''
   The CDC said communities should consider contingency plans for
suicide clusters, and ``may want to consider implementing a suicide
response plan before a cluster has begun.'' Many suicide clusters,
the agency said, have followed one or more deaths due to injuries
among young people.
   Planning ahead can keep communities from ``reinventing the
wheel'' during their own tragedies, said Dr. Patrick O'Carroll of
the CDC.
   ``There's no reason for every single community that runs into
this to try to start from scratch. There's experience they can try
to take advantage of,'' O'Carroll said.
   Bergenfield, a suburban community six miles west of New York,
had an annual suicide rate of seven per 100,000 during 1980-84,
significantly lower than the national rate of 12 per 100,000, CDC
researchers found.
   But in that town and in others where people have died in
apparent suicide pacts, there have been similarities, the CDC said:
other young people had died unnaturally before the suicides, and
the suicides may have had a ``contagious'' effect, prompting others
to try to kill themselves.
   The young Bergenfield men had both been friends of an
18-year-old who died in a fall from a cliff six months earlier. And
after the four teen-agers killed themselves, two other young people
_ a 20-year-old and a 17-year-old _ attempted suicide together in
the same garage.

<HEAD>Fitzwater Says Plant Closing Provision Would Harm Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied
Friday that the Reagan administration's resistance to a
labor-backed plant-closing provision in a new trade bill
constitutes an anti-worker stance.
   While renewing President Reagan's threat to veto the legislation
if the plant shutdown notification requirement remained intact,
Fitzwater said, ``We're trying to keep people's jobs.''
   ``We want a trade bill that doesn't eliminate jobs through
foreign competition,'' he said.
   ``We want a bill that maximizes the opportunities for companies
to stay in business and people can keep their jobs,'' Fitzwater
told reporters. ``And that's what you're going to hear from us if
we have to veto this bill.''
   But during his daily White House news briefing, the spokesman
acknowledged that administration negotiators on the sweeping trade
bill are stymied in attempts to talk lawmakers into discarding the
plant notification provision.
   ``I think there's still some opportunity for talk,'' he said.
But he said Reagan would not accept any version of the trade bill
that contained provisions which are ``injurious to a dynamic
economy.''
   Fitzwater reiterated Reagan's veto intentions in the wake of a
further deterioration of America's trade deficit and as House and
Senate members wrangled over the language to be kept in the final
version of the 1,000-page trade bill.
   Conferees are trying to iron out differences between competing
House and Senate versions of the bill. The plant-closings
provision, which was approved by the Senate but not the House,
would require companies with at least 100 employees to give 60-day
notice of plant closings or layoffs involving at least 150
positions if that represented one-third of the work force.
   All layoffs of 500 or more would have to be accompanied by
notice, regardless of whether they represented a third of the work
force.
   Business groups oppose the provision, arguing that it could lead
to other steps to strip away the prerogatives of company managers.
The AFL-CIO and other organizations in the labor movement maintain
the measure is necessary to prepare workers for the need to find
new employment.
   ``The Congress made good progress in moving toward such a
bill,'' Fitzwater said Friday. But he said the White House is
displeased that the plant-closing provision remains in the bill.
   ``Our negotiators ... were encouraged to believe the plant
closing provision would be eliminated,'' Fitzwater said. ``Later,
however, we were told that after certain consultations took place,
they could not remove that provision. The labor unions apparently
would sacrifice the entire trade bill for this provision.''
   ``While the administration would be willing to accept a positive
trade bill, we cannot accept one that includes seriously flawed
elements that will hurt America's competitiveness,'' the spokesman
said.
   ``If the bill reaches the president in its present form, the
president will veto it,'' Fitzwater said.
   The Democratic leadership had seemed close to dropping the
plant-closings plan on Wednesday. But overnight lobbying by
organized labor led to a chorus of protests Thursday in the House
Democratic caucus, said sources who spoke only if not quoted by
name.
   Top Democrats announced their support for the plan at
midafternoon Thursday. They said new figures from the Commerce
Department showing a widening U.S. trade deficit and an
accompanying 101-point drop in the stock market called for a strong
legislative response.

<HEAD>Star Trek-style Monitor Could Be On Market in 18 Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The idea is something out of ``Star Trek,'' a
hand-held device that a doctor or nurse can point at a patient to
register heart and respiration rates.
   But the vital signs monitor which a new company hopes to put on
the market in 18 months is expected to look more like a pocket
calculator than the sleek cylinders used by Dr. Leonard ``Bones''
McCoy on the Enterpirse.
   And the device was inspired not by science fiction, but by a
military need to help medics in the battlefield.
   A prototype somewhat bigger than a briefcase has been delivered
to the military by Georgia Tech researchers. The university has
licensed Health Techniques of Georgia Inc., a company formed last
August, to sell the technology to civilian health care providers.
   ``We think it has particular application for patients who are
severely burned, where no contact (with the skin) is possible or
looked for, and also with patients who may have a contagious
disease or patients who have compromised immune systems and have to
be isolated from contact with other people,'' said Doug Robinson,
chief operating officer of Health Techniques.
   Robinson said the device would weigh 1{ to 2 pounds and would
have a top range of six feet to 10 feet. He said the comparison to
the chirping medical scanners on ``Star Trek'' is inevitable.
   ``I've heard that more times than you can imagine. It's really
very close to that,'' he said.
   Stephen Bonasera, a research engineer on the Tech team which is
developing the monitor, said the device depends on microwave
transmissions bounced off the patient's body. ``Phase changes'' in
the waves show the heart's movements, he said.
   In addition to the heart and respiratory rate functions, Health
Techniques hopes the device can be refined to also measure body
temperature.
   Bonasera said the monitor also can reveal information about the
mechanical workings of the heart, something an electrocardiogram,
or EKG, cannot do. The researcher said more work is needed on
interpreting the returning microwave signals to do that.
   Tech's work began in 1984 with Navy funding. The Air Force later
contributed funding, and Bonasera said the Army also is interested.
   ``They're imagining, say, a chemical battlefield in Europe, that
you have medics going around and picking up patients for trage and
you want to limit the exposure of the medics. They want a device
you could point at a patient to find out yes or no, is he alive?''
he said.
   Dr. David Erwin of the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine at
Brooks Air Force Base, Texas, said other battlefield casualties
also would benefit.
   ``In the military, we have situations where people are in all
types of clothing; it makes it very difficult to put on a
stethoscope or blood pressure test,'' he said.

<NOTE>Eds: Subs grafs 4-5 pvs, Billig automatically, to restore initial
identification of spokeswoman.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A day after his conviction on charges of
killing three patients was overturned, Navy heart surgeon Donal M.
Billig was allowed today to leave Fort Leavenworth, Kan., where he
had been held prisoner for two years.
   The U.S. Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review on Thursday
overturned Billig's conviction because, the court said, ``the
evidence was simply not sufficient.''
   Billig, held at the fort since 1986, was released from the
prison itself Thursday, but was held overnite in the base's
bachelor officers quarters while administrative paperwork was
completed.
   Billig automatically returns to active duty with his previous
rank of commander and is eligible for $120,000 in back pay, but he
cannot practice medicine, said Navy spokeswoman, Lt. Janet Mescus.
   She said Billig would probably be assigned to a Navy-Marine
Corps reserve center in Kansas City while the Navy makes a decision
on appealing the verdict. The service has 20 days to make that
decision.
   The court's 20-page opinion said prosecutors had failed to
establish Billig's guilt ``beyond a reasonable doubt.''
   The appeals court said the prosecutors at Billig's 1986 court
martial ``lost sight of the fact that coronary artery bypass
surgery is an inherently risky business.''
   The prosecutors argued that Billig used questionable surgical
techniques, the court said, but never really produced the evidence
or testimony to demonstrate that Billig's work in the operating
room was so out of line as to constitute criminal conduct.
   ``We shall set aside all findings of guilty based on this
factual insufficiency of the evidence,'' the court said.
   The Navy has 20 days to file a formal motion with the appeals
court asking it to reconsider the matter. The service said Thursday
it had made no decision yet on pursuing an appeal.
   Billig, 57, was the former chief heart surgeon at the Navy's
flagship Bethesda, Md., Naval Hospital, and held the military rank
of commander.
   He was convicted in early 1986 of two counts of involuntary
manslaughter and one count of negligent homicide in the deaths of
three patients. He also was convicted on 18 of 24 counts of
dereliction of duty stemming from other operations. He was
sentenced on March 3, 1986, to four years in prison. Last summer,
he was rebuffed in his first bid for parole.
   Billig's case attracted great public attention, in part because
of the sensational nature of some of the charges. It also prompted
congressional reviews of military health care in general and
several large monetary settlements between the government and
relatives of Billig's patients.
   Prosecutors described Billig as an egocentric man, nearly blind
in one eye, who hid his visual handicap and continued performing
complex heart operations despite numerous warnings that he was
killing patients.
   The appeals court, in its opinion, said it was troubled by
Billig's conviction because his court-martial had involved criminal
charges as opposed to civil claims for damages based on negligence.
   The court quoted from a New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that
stated: ``The question is not whether a defendant should absorb the
dollar loss of his victim, but whether his conduct justifies
stamping him a criminal and sending him to state prison.''
   In Billig's case, the military court said it appeared the
prosecutors ``lost sight of the fact that coronary artery bypass
surgery is an inherently risky business ... and that those patients
who agree to this elective surgery are quite ill in the first place
...''
   ``Given the critical nature of the work and its complexity,
these surgeons face a difficult enough task without having to worry
about the spectre of the criminal prosecutor, waiting to reduce to
a `charge sheet' honest mistakes which fall far short of the gross,
wanton and deliberate misconduct ... that truly deserves punishment.
   ``We are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the deaths
that formed the basis of the appellant's conviction were due to any
negligence, simple or otherwise, on his part.''
   The court also faulted the presiding military judge at the
court-martial for allowing the prosecution to conduct ``a smear
campaign'' against Billig.
   ``The appellant was forced not only to defend against the
charges, but also to explain and account for virtually all of his
mistakes, professional setbacks or surgical misadventures during
the previous 20 years. This `bad surgeon' theory permeated the
trial proceedings and undoubtedly influenced the court members'
decisions.''

   Dozens of Israeli settlers, guarded by as many
soldiers, marched Friday near the Arab town where 15-year-old
settler Tirza Porat and two Palestinians were killed in an exchange
of gunfire and rocks last week.
   Their purpose was to demonstrate that Jews could walk freely in
the occupied West Bank. Army radio said they objected to the large
army guard for the mass re-enactment of the hike by Miss Porat and
a group of friends.
   Israeli troops wounded two Palestinians in scattered violence
Friday after midday prayers on the Moslem sabbath, hospital
officials reported. The army deployed hundreds of soldiers and
surrounded major mosques to keep order in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   Violence after Friday prayers has become a ritual since violence
began Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, which Israel
captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. At
least 146 Palestinians have been killed in the 18 weeks, along with
Miss Porat and an Israeli soldier.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he was ready to invite Eduard
A. Shevardnadze to Israel if he could be certain the invitation
would be accepted, a spokesman said. The Soviet foreign minister is
to visit Jordan, Syria and possibly Egypt later this month.
   Israeli soldiers surrounded mosques in the West Bank cities of
Hebron and Qalqilya and imposed a curfew Friday in the downtown
district of Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, Arab reports said.
   Soldiers and Palestinians clashed at several mosques in Gaza and
two Palestinians were reported wounded. Officials at Shifa Hospital
said a 13-year-old boy from nearby Beit Hanoun in critical
condition with a bullet wound in the stomach.
   They said an 18-year-old in Jabaliya was was shot in the leg,
the officials said.
   The army confirmed clashes at Jabaliya but said soldiers used
only rubber bullets, and said the Beit Hanoun incident was being
investigated.
   An army helicopter flew surveillance over Jerusalem's two main
mosques as thousands of Moslem worshipers gathered to pray.
   After prayers, 250 youths circled Al Aqsa mosque waving a
Palestinian flag. They shouted ``Allahu Akbar! (God is Great!)''
and threw rocks and empty bottles at police.
   Associated Press photographer Max Nash saw police detain five
boys aged 7 to 9. They had been throwing rocks near Flower Gate, a
northern entrance to the walled Old City that borders a main
shopping street used by Jews and Arabs.
   Romam Aldubi, a 26-year-old settler who guarded Tirza Porat and
the other hikers April 6, was beaten on the head in clash with Arab
residents of Beita and has not regained conciousness. Investigative
reports indicate the girl may have been killed by Aldubi's gun but
the bullet has not been found.
   Maj. Gen Amram Mitzna, military commander of the West Bank,
visited Aldubi on Friday at Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital, brushing
past members of the man's family who angrily asked him to go away.
   ``I don't welcome the visit,'' said Aldubi's brother Yanir, 29.
``Romam is lying here because of the way Mitzna reacted to the Arab
violence. A strong army should be feared not only when it's in the
area, but also when it is not there.''
   Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Shamir, said the prime minister
``would very much like to welcome the Soviet foreign minister to
Jerusalem for discussions, but Shamir will not just throw out an
invitation. He needs to know the foreign minister will come.''
   Shevardnadze said Thursday after signing an accord on withdrawal
of Soviet troops from Afghanistan that it could open the way for a
Middle East peace settlement.
   ``The signing of the Geneva agreements certainly stimulates
positive processes in the settlement of other regional issues,
including the Middle East,'' he told reporters in Geneva.
   Shamir opposes the Kremlin proposal for an international
conference including the Palestine Liberation Organization and the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: the United
States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.
   Under the Soviet plan, participants in the conference would play
active roles in peace talks.
   The prime minister suggests that the United States and Soviet
Union invite Israel and Jordan to a meeting and then leave the two
adversaries to negotiate directly.
   He also says Moscow must allow Soviet Jews to emigrate and must
renew diplomatic relations severed during the 1967 war before it
can have a part in Middle East negotiations.

<HEAD>Officials Warn Against Unofficial Observances Of Anniversary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Polish authorities on Friday warned
organizers of an unsanctioned ceremony to mark the 45th anniversary
of the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto Uprising that the gathering would be
considered illegal, an organizer said.
   The warning came on the second day of a weeklong official
anniversary to honor the victims of the Nazi Holocaust during World
War II. It is the largest such event ever organized in Poland.
   On Friday, meanwhile, a Polish scholar told a scientific
conference that she is ashamed of anti-Semitic behavior in Poland
in 1968 and asked why more Polish officials, including some
conference organizers, have not come forward to accept
responsibility.
   About 4,500 people from around the world, including 2,000 from
Israel including Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon, have
come to Poland for the Ghetto Uprising Anniversary, honoring the
fighters who resisted the final Nazi onslaught against the ghetto
for three weeks in April and May of 1943.
   In addition to the official observances, a group of 46
intellectuals and opposition activists has called for an unofficial
ceremony Sunday in front of the Warsaw Ghetto Fighters' Monument
and in the old Jewish Cemetery.
   The group is led by Marek Edelman, a longtime opposition
activist who is the last surviving commander of the uprising
remaining in Poland. Edelman says he is boycotting the official
observances because he considers them a cynical attempt by the
government to win favor in the West.
   Jacek Kuron, an organizer of the unsanctioned ceremony and an
adviser to the outlawed trade union Solidarity, said he was taken
to a Warsaw prosecutor's office for the warning talk by
plainclothed police.
   ``I was told that the event which I am co-organizing on Sunday .
.. is illegal ... so the authorities cannot assure protection and
the (organizing) committee will be morally and legally responsible
for any possible provocations which might take place,'' Kuron said.
   Kuron said the committee intends to proceed with the observances
anyway, including a wreath-laying ceremony at the Ghetto Fighters'
Monument and the dedication of a memorial in the Jewish Cemetery to
two Polish-Jewish socialists executed by the Soviet Union during
World War II.
   The alternative observances have come under heavy attack in the
official media, which has charged the organizers with being
anti-Soviet ``hyenas'' trying to take advantage of the anniversary
to call attention to themselves.
   Meanwhile, on the second day of a two-day historical and
scientific conference on the struggle of Jews and Poles under the
Nazi occupation, Irena Maciejewska drew applause at the conference
when she referred to the politically inspired anti-Semitic purge
that took place in Poland in 1968.
   Mrs. Maciejewska, who was delivering a paper on the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising in literature, said that when she cooperates with
one official institution co-sponsoring the conference, the Jewish
Historical Institute, she finds herself ``in the company of people
who injured the good name of Poland in 1968.''
   To applause from the audience of several hundred people, she
added: ``As a university person I painfully remember that time and
as a Pole I should be ashamed of it.''
   The Polish United Workers (Communist) Party, in a newspaper
article last month, said anti-Semitism played a role in 1968 in
political purges that caused thousands of Jews to lose jobs in
government, journalism, the army and academia.
   Opposition activists criticized the statement as being too mild
and for not identifying individuals involved, some of whom they
charged still hold prominent positions in Poland.

<HEAD>U.S. Vetoes Resolution on Israel</HEAD>
<HEAD>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States today vetoed a Security
Council resolution urging Israel to halt deportations of
Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The U.S. envoy said the measure was unbalanced. The vote was
14-1.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization envoy, Zehdi L. Terzi,
condemned the U.S. veto as shielding Israel from international
criticism.
   ``The United States has chosen to single itself out,'' he said.
``There's always a rotten apple in the box.''
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun cast the veto and said the
resolution's ``broad and sweeping condemnation of Israel contains
not a scintilla of balance. It contains no appeal or request for
calm.''
   Okun said the resolution ``neither contributes to easing
tensions in the occupied territories, nor promotes the cause of
peace.''
   The U.S. envoy said it was the fifth time since December that
the council considered the Middle East situation. ``We do not
regard this recurrent recourse to the Security Council as befitting
its authority and prestige,'' he said.
   He said the United States was engaged in a major diplomatic
effort with the parties directly concerned to bring about direct
negotiations between Israel and her Arab neighbors.
   The meeting of the 15-member council was prompted by Israel's
deportation of eight Palestinian civilians this week.
   Since anti-occupation unrest broke out Dec. 8, 146 Arabs have
been killed in the territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   The resolution, originally toughly worded, had been watered down
in an unsuccessful effort to avert a veto by the United States,
which often kills resolutions critical of its ally.
   The vetoed resolution, supported by Britain, France, West
Germany and all other council members, urged Israel to halt
deportations and condemned violations of human rights in the
occupied territories.
   It called for a U.N.-sponsored settlement of the Middle East
problem.
   Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov reflected new
flexibility by his government on a Middle East solution, diplomats
said.
   In his speech, criticism of Israel was not as strident as in
earlier speeches and he emphasized the importance of ``balance of
interests of all parties concerned, both Arabs, including the
Palestinian people, as well as Israel.''
   He said a U.N.-sponsored international conference is ``the most
effective machinery'' to achieve a political settlement. He
indicated that ``interim arrangements'' could be acceptable and
said that a conference on the Middle East could be conducted on
both a ``bilateral and multilateral basis.''
   Israel and the United States have opposed an international
conference that would impose a settlement upon Israel and are
opposed to participation by the PLO. They have emphasized the
importance of bilateral negotiations between Israel and her
neighbors.

<HEAD>Unions Strike For Raises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About half of Lebanon's businesses closed
Friday in the first day of a national strike called by a union
demanding a 300 percent wage increase.
   The government of this chaos-ridden nation, which faces a severe
economic crisis, has offered an increase of about 75 percent.
   Police said 50 percent of both Moslem and Christian areas were
closed in response to the strike call issued Thursday by the
General Confederation of Labor Unions, or GCLU.
   Some banks, schools, restaurants, movie theaters, gas stations
and other businesses closed in Beirut's Moslem and Christian
sectors as well as in other major cities and towns, a police
statement said.
   However, a variety of businesses defied the 300,000-member union
and maintained normal activity.
   The union called for the two-day strike after rejecting as
insufficient the 75 percent increase in private- and public-sector
wages announced by acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   ``Some employers are clearly defying the GCLU's decision. They
called their employees to work, and strangely these employees
reported to duty,'' a police spokesman said.
   ``GCLU teams are touring Beirut and other cities in an effort to
convince violators to abide by the strike,'' said the spokesman.
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the 75 percent increase ``is the highest the state treasury and
private businesses can afford.''
   ``The employees realize this. That's why they are hesitant in
abiding by the strike,'' he said.
   Ahmed Srouji, who runs a ready-made clothes factory in Moslem
west Beirut, said even a 75 percent raise would be ``difficult to
meet.''
   ``We will have to raise our prices. In this case, the unions
will start nagging again and demand another pay raise,'' Srouji
said at his factory, which stayed open Friday.
   ``If the unions insist on a 300 percent raise, I will close,''
he threatened. ``Closing will strip my 70 employees from their
income. Is this what the GCLU wants?''
   Some of his employees also appeared convinced that the size of
the raise demand was not in their interest.
   ``The boss will definitely fire most of us if the 300 percent
increase was decided,'' said Elie Abu Issa, who works at a
hairdressing salon in Christian east Beirut.
   ``There would be less clients if the raise was decided because
the fees would be brought up sharply. In such a case, the boss and
an assistant will be enough to handle the job, and most of us will
be fired,'' Abu Issa said.
   ``I don't want to be unemployed, especially when prices are
soaring,'' he added.
   The Lebanese pound slipped against foreign currencies following
Hoss' 75 percent pay increase announcement Thursday and closed at
400 to the dollar. It opened at 380 to the dollar early in the day.
   Lebanon's economy, once the most flourishing in the Middle East,
has been hit hard by 13 years of violence.
   The pound, which rated 2.5 to the dollar before the outbreak of
the civil war in 1975, has declined sharply against foreign
currencies, pushing prices sky high in a nation that imports more
than 85 percent of its needs.

   The government on Friday blamed the United
States for lack of progress in negotiations for a new U.S. bases
agreement to replace an accord that expires in December.
   ``The American side doesn't seem disposed to accept certain
points and that's the reason why the discussions are essentially
where they started,'' said government spokesman Yiannis Roubatis.
By ``certain points,'' Roubatis was understood to mean
Greek-Turkish disputes over the Aegean Sea and the divided
Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou has repeatedly said that successful
negotiation of a new bases accord will be linked to progress on
these issues. The United States has refused to be drawn into
regional disputes.
   Negotiations for a new U.S. bases agreement to replace the
existing five-year accord began in November. Officials have held
four rounds of monthly three-day sessions to try to hammer out a
new agreement.
   The next meeting is set for next week in Athens.
   Four American bases have operated in Greece since the 1950s _
two near Athens and two on the southern island of Crete.

<HEAD>US Distressed over Danish Anti-Nuclear Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Friday it was
``deeply distressed'' over a resolution approved by the Danish
parliament which closes a loophole in a government ban on ships
carrying nuclear weapons into Danish ports.
   The resolution, approved Thursday by a 75-58 vote, requires the
government to inform visiting naval vessels of Denmark's
anti-nuclear policy. Denmark has a nuclear ban policy but has not
been asking such vessels if they are carrying nuclear weapons.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said implementation of
the Danish resolution in a way which is inconsistent with the U.S.
policy of not discussing which ships carry nuclear weapons would
undercut NATO security. The United States has a long-standing
policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear
weapons aboard its ships.
   ``This policy is central to the U.S. ability to fulfill its NATO
commitments,'' Redman said. ``We are not going to change it.''
   ``It would have extremely serious consequences for U.S.-Danish
defense cooperation,'' he said, adding that the impact of this
issue extends beyond bilateral relations.
   ``It goes to the very heart of the meaning and interlocking
nature of our mutual commitments within the NATO alliance,'' he
said.
   Redman said the policy of withholding information about the
presence of nuclear weapons is aimed at keeping ``terrorists and
saboteurs'' in the dark and makes effective attacks on U.S. forces
more difficult.
   Redman added that the United States will review together with
the Danish government and other NATO allies the implications of the
resolution for the NATO alliance and continued defense cooperation
with Denmark.

<HEAD>U.S. Military Reverses Decision To Fire Japanese Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. military on Friday reversed an earlier
decision to lay off 271 Japanese employees at its bases on Okinawa.
   Hiroo Takakura, head of the labor division of Japan's Defense
Facilities Administration Agency, said the U.S. decision followed
talks since last year between Japanese and U.S. officials.
   The U.S. Military Forces in Japan had planned the layoffs
because the yen's recent rise against the dollar made it more
expensive to maintain employees.
   U.S. officials notified the Japanese government of the decision
Friday, Takakura said.
   Japan agreed last month to assume a larger share of the costs of
running U.S. military bases in Japan. Under the agreement, Japan's
share of allowances for Japanese base workers will be boosted from
the current 50 percent to 100 percent, or about $162 million in
1991.
   The United States pays the salaries of the Japanese workers, but
all other benefits and allowances, including transportation,
housing and retirement expenses, will be covered by Japan.
   There are about 21,000 Japanese employees at U.S. military
facilities across Japan, where more than 60,000 U.S. military
personnel are stationed.

<TEXT>
   Army soldiers on Friday captured 10
followers of the fugitive leader of a bloody coup attempt in raids
the military said foiled a plot to attack the presidential palace.
   The military went on nationwide alert this week to guard against
any coup attempt while President Corazon Aquino was visitin China.
   Chief military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said those arrested
included eight navy guards who helped former Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan escape his prison ship 13 days ago. Honasan led
the attempted coup last Aug. 28.
   The failed coup in August left at least 53 people dead and more
than 300 others wounded. Among those hurt was Mrs. Aquino's only
son, Benigno Aquino III.
   Florendo said the operation was continuing but that Honasan
remained at large. Honasan had been detained on the navy ship since
his arrest last December in a Manila suburb.
   Col. Emiliano Templo, leader of the raiding party, told The
Associated Press that the military learned of a plot to attack the
presidential compound ``so we acted quickly. We pre-empted the
plan.''
   Templo said the conspirators allegedly planned to approach the
palace by rubber boats, traveling down a nearby stream which flows
into the Pasig river. The presidential palace is on the banks of
the Pasig in the heart of Manila.
   Templo did not say when the attack was to have been carried out.
Government television reported that the raids foiled ``a
destabilization plan'' which was to have been launched Friday night.
   Mrs. Aquino left Thursday for a four-day visit to China and Hong
Kong. It was her first trip abroad since visiting Japan in November
1986.
   Florendo said Mrs. Aquino was notified of the raids by telephone
in Beijing and ``she was delighted with what happened.''
   Mrs. Aquino met Friday with Chinese Premier Li Peng and
President Yang Shangkun. Mrs. Aquino and Li agreed that their rival
claims to the Spratly Islands should be settled peacefully, a
Philippine spokesman said.
   Li and Shangkun also said they would take steps to reduce
China's large trade surplus with the Philippines, according to
Teodoro Benigno, Mrs. Aquino's spokesman.
   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, commander of the National Capital
Regional Defense Command, said three Marine companies and 30 police
and soldiers carried out the raids in the swank Blue Ridge district
of suburban Quezon City.
   He said the raid on the house where the 10 men were found lasted
only 15 minutes, and there was no resistance. Florendo said up to
eight houses were raided, but all those arrested were found in one
dwelling.
   They included Lt. Gerardo Mojica, commander of the security
force aboard the ship from which Honasan escaped. Two of those
arrested were civilians, Biazon said.
   Troops seized 16 M-14 rifles, four M-16s, one light machine gun,
five Israeli-made Uzi machine guns, five radio sets, a grenade
launcher, several grenades and ammunition.
   Florendo told reporters that the 10 denied planning any attacks.
   Last week, Honasan said in a statement that he was withdrawing a
pledge made a month before his arrest that he would refrain from
``hostile acts'' against the Aquino government.
   Earlier Friday, the military announced the filing of the first
mutiny charges against officers linked to Honasan's failed coup.
   Military spokesman Lt. Anselmo Cabingan said those formally
charged included two lieutenant colonels, a major and two
lieutenants. They were to be arraigned before a military court
Monday, he said.
   In other developments, police clashed Friday with stone-throwing
leftists near the U.S. Embassy and blocked a nearby march by
militant Moslems protesting U.S. bombing raids on Libya two years
ago. Two demonstrators and one policeman were injured in the clash.

   Divers have discovered a Nazi U-boat
submerged inside a partially destroyed submarine pen near Kiel,
city officials said Friday.
   Several months ago, long-time residents told city officials they
recalled there had been a submarine inside the giant concrete
U-boat bunker, and divers were hired to search for the vessel
earlier this month.
   Allied warplanes heavily bombed U-boat pens in northern Germany
during World War II.
   The submarine pen, on the east side of the Baltic Sea inlet
where Kiel is located, was originally 198 feet wide and 561 feet
long, city officials say.
   Some people want the pen preserved as a memorial, but city
planners want to clear the area to develop the harbor.

<HEAD>US Warns Senate Vote on Mexico May Backfire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA </BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Friday a Senate vote
to impose sanctions on Mexico for not doing enough to curb illicit
drug flows could actually lead to an increase in such traffic.
   ``Far from serving as a catalyst for action, this vote
castigates a friend for less than perfect behavior,'' department
spokesman Charles Redman said.
   He added that the resolution, approved Thursday night, fails to
recognize Mexico's substantial anti-drug efforts and the
``extremely positive response'' of President Miguel de la Madrid to
President Reagan's call for enhanced cooperation.
   The Senate voted 63-27 to overturn a finding made by Reagan six
weeks ago that Mexico was ``fully cooperating'' with the United
States in the war on drugs.
   Redman said that if Congress reverses Reagan's certification,
this would ``jeopardize further U.S.-Mexico cooperation and could
lead to greater drug flows into the United States.
   ``It could, in addition, seriously damage important U.S.
economic and political interests in Mexico,'' he said.
   If adopted by the Congress, the resolution could deprive Mexico
of certain trade benefits and would require U.S. representatives in
international lending institutions to vote against Mexican loan
applications.
   In a brief statement Thursday night, Mexico's Foreign Ministry
rejected the U.S. action as ``foreign interference'' in Mexican
affairs.
   ``No power can claim for itself the right to certify the conduct
of other societies or governments. No one has the right to impose
from abroad conduct, ideas, political or economic systems on other
peoples,'' the statement said.
   Legislation to slap aid sanctions on Mexico and four other Latin
American countries also is pending in the House, which would have
to approve the Mexico resolution before it could become law. Even
supporters of the bill conceded the measure has little likelihood
of clearing all the hurdles, but said the symbolic value of the
Senate vote was enough.
   ``It's all rather academic,'' said Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.,
the bill's primary sponsor. ``But by adopting this resolution, we
will be sending a message to the government of Mexico.''
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said close to 40 percent of the
cocaine that enters the United States comes through Mexico, making
the 1,900-mile border between the two countries the No. 1 entry
point for narcotics.
   ``We've got to take off the gloves,'' he said.

   The State Department, rejecting Senate
criticism, said Friday a proposed $450 million military sale to
Saudi Arabia is required to continue the close relationship the two
contries have in operating AWACS radar aircraft.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman made that comment in
response to an appeal by 58 senators that the administration
reconsider the proposed sale because of the secret Saudi purchase
of Chinese missiles.
   ``This is not a sale of a new item or system or even spare
parts,'' Redman said. ``It is strictly a support program, an
operations and maintenance contract for the previously approved and
already delivered AWACs.
   ``The support program is important in continuing the close
cooperative working relationship we have in AWACS operations with
the Saudis.''

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s attacks on his rivals
have brought him more animosity than votes in New York, leaving his
campaign seemingly stalled in the last days before Tuesday's
primary, poll analysts say.
   Gore's Democratic opponents have solidified their support,
surveys this week indicate, with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
retaining a comfortable lead over Jesse Jackson. Gore is a poor
third.
   One poll indicated Dukakis may have overcome the weakness of
support that plagued him in early contests. It said 67 percent of
his support was strong, 9 points better than Walter Mondale's in
1984, when Mondale won the state.
   Jackson maintained his powerful support among blacks, who make
up about one-quarter of the Democratic primary vote, but was
drawing only about 17 percent of the white vote and was splitting
the Hispanic vote with Dukakis.
   ``I think it's a two-person race. I don't believe to date that
Gore has made a mark,'' said Meyer S. Frucher, a leading state
political strategist. ``A lot of people feel turned off'' by Gore's
campaign style, he said.
   Two New York polls by the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion appeared to support that view. One done April 5-6 said Gore
was viewed unfavorably by 29 percent. One week of campaigning
later, that was up to 36.
   ``Part of Gore's problem is an overwhelmingly negative reaction
on the part of the black community,'' said Lee Miringoff, the
Marist pollster. Nine percent of blacks rated Gore favorably, 50
percent unfavorably, he said.
   The Marist poll also indicated Gore was not drawing Jews from
Dukakis, despite his aggressive effort to portray himself as more
staunchly pro-Israel.
   ``The problem with the Gore strategy among the Jews is that he
was appealing to conservative Jewish Democrats. And those are
called Republicans in New York,'' Miringoff said. Dukakis had 70
percent of the Jewish vote in the Marist poll, Gore 12 percent _
unchanged from the week before. Dukakis's favorable-unfavorable
rating among Jews was 87-7; Gore's, 49-23.
   The Marist poll was conducted Monday and Tuesday, before Gore
launched a sharp midweek attack on Dukakis' nuclear policy.
   Frucher, a close adviser to Gov. Mario Cuomo, said he expected
Gore's newer moves to miss the mark. ``Negative works, don't get me
wrong. But it only works if you have a positive image,'' he said.
``And that just hasn't been created.''
   For Jackson, widespread support among whites remained elusive. A
New York Post poll Friday put his white support at 17 percent;
Marist said 16 percent.
   Voters who are supporting Jackson are doing so solidly; 82
percent in the Marist poll said they backed him strongly. That
would help him in a light turnout, when only the most committed
voters show up at the polls.
   The Marist poll found 67 percent of Dukakis' supporters were
strongly behind him. A survey by ABC News and The Washington Post
found less strength for both Dukakis and Jackson. It said half
Dukakis' supporters were strong, compared to two-thirds of
Jackson's.
   The ABC News-Post poll was done Wednesday night among 176 likely
Democratic voters and had a margin of error of 8 points. The Marist
poll was done Monday and Tuesday among 359 Democrats and had a
5-point error margin.
   The strength of Gore's support was flat _ 40 percent in the
April 5-6 Marist poll, 41 percent in this week's survey.
   The Marist poll said 13 percent of likely Democratic voters were
undecided or uncommitted; a CBS News poll said 19 percent were
uncommitted or undecided.
   The CBS poll, which was done Monday through Wednesday and had a
4-point error margin, had Dukakis with 45 percent support, Jackson
28 and Gore 8. ABC had it as Dukakis 49, Jackson, 34, Gore 8. The
Marist poll said Dukakis had 46 percent, Jackson 34 and Gore 7. The
New York Post poll, done Monday and Tuesday and with a 4-point
error margin, had Dukakis at 50 percent, Jackson 33, Gore 9.

<HEAD>Judge Grants PTL Additional Month To Revise Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Clarifies in 2nd, 5th grafs that reorganization plan now due
a month from today, not from May 2.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL will not make a $5.7 million payment
owed creditors next month and will lay off an additional 125
employees, the court-appointed trustee for the television ministry
said today.
   Federal bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds also granted PTL more
time to make revisions in its court-approved bankruptcy
reorganization plan.
   Possible revisions to the plan include the sale of $3 million to
$4 million of undeveloped land this year, PTL trustee David Clark
said. Other assets, including the Heritage Grand Hotel, could be
sold as a last resort, he said.
   PTL must try to keep the television show on the air even without
other ``non-essential assets'' such as the theme park, he said.
   Reynolds gave PTL until May 15 for the revisions after a hearing
on a government motion to delay the May 2 implementation of PTL's
court-approved plan.
   In the motion filed in federal bankruptcy court in Columbia,
S.C., Justice Department attorneys argued that PTL remains on shaky
ground with the Internal Revenue Service, which is seeking more
than $55 million in back taxes.
   PTL's reorganization calls for the television ministry to repay
more than $60 million in debts accumulated by former PTL leaders
Jim and Tammy Bakker.
   The U.S. government appealed the PTL reorganization plan on Dec.
29, and still opposes it.
   The reorganization plan anticipates that PTL will qualify as tax
exempt. But so far, the IRS hasn't agreed to PTL's request and has
warned that PTL may lose its tax-exempt status.
   Today's hearing was held in Greensboro, the judge's home
courtroom.

<HEAD>Third Full-Scale Test-Firing Set Wednesday For Redesigned Shuttle
Booster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The third full-scale test firing of
the redesigned space shuttle booster rocket will be conducted
Wednesday, Morton Thiokol Inc. announced.
   Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said the 1 p.m. horizontal
firing of the 126-foot-long rocket will last two minutes. The
booster, 12 feet in diameter, contains 1.1 million pounds of
propellant.
   During the second full-scale firing on Dec. 23, the rocket's
NASA-designed nozzle boot ring broke apart. The boot ring, about
two inches thick, protects a flexible bearing that allows the
nozzle to swivel and steer the rocket.
   Company officials said the test will incorporate the nozzle boot
ring designed by Morton Thiokol which performed successfully during
the first full-scale test last August.
   Wednesday's firing, although the third of its kind at the
Wasatch Operations test site, is the first of three required to
qualify the new booster for flight. Subsequent tests are scheduled
June 3 and July 6.
   The August and December tests evaluated primary and alternate
elements of solid rocket motor design, Raab said.
   He said the center field joint on the motor to be tested next
week has been assembled with an ``intentional manufacturing-type
flaw'' in the bonded insulation's J-seal.
   ``This defect may allow hot gases to penetrate the bonded
insulation'' and reach an O-ring barrier, but Raab added that
short-duration test firings with similar defects have shown that
such defects tend to seal under motor pressure, preventing the
release of gases.
   The escape of such super-hot gases from a Morton Thiokol booster
was blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the shuttle
Challenger and deaths of its seven crew members.
   The resumption of shuttle missions is tentatively scheduled for
Aug. 4, although NASA officials have said technical problems could
further delay the launch.

<HEAD>Gas Station Fuels Controversy During Ghetto Anniversary</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland-Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The designer of a monument to 300,000 Jews
who were sent to their deaths during World War II says an adjoining
gas station should be closed because it is insulting to the victims.
   The filling station abuts the sparkling new marble-and-stone
memorial at Umschlagplatz, the railroad siding which bordered the
walled Jewish ghetto during the war.
   The monument is being dedicated Monday as part of elaborately
planned observances marking the 45th anniversary of the doomed
Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, in which some of the last 70,000
inhabitants took up arms against the final Nazi eradication drive
on April 19, 1943.
   Workmen were busily trying to complete the 20-yard-by-6-yard
memorial this week, but whether the gas station next door will
reopen in a few weeks remained unclear and a source of controversy.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski said Thursday
that official plans always have been to close down the the station
once the monument was built.
   But Roman Slawinski, director of the Warsaw branch of the state
gasoline monopoly CPN, said the station will reopen after the
anniversary ceremonies.
   He did not elaborate, but an official source demanding anonymity
said the station ``will start operations again until another
location is decided upon, and another station is built at the
expense of those building the monument.''
   According to the designer of the monument, Hanna Szmalenberg,
that is ``blackmail.''
   ``It shouldn't be there,'' she said. ``No other important
monument has a gas station nearby. It is insulting to the memory.''
   She said the station should never have been constructed at the
site and charged that putting it there in the first place was a
``political decision'' which stemmed from an anti-Semitic purge
which took place in Poland in 1968.
   Even though an Israeli donor has offered to pay for construction
of a replacement gas station, she said, CPN has been holding out
for more money.
   Ms. Szmalenberg, interviewed in the gas station lot Wednesday,
said she designed the $252,000 monument as an enclosed rectangle in
part because of the station's proximity.
   There often are long lines of cars at Polish gas stations, and
idling vehicles just a few feet from the monument could be expected
to disturb visitors, she said.
   In her design, she said, visitors will be able to step inside to
partially avoid the fumes and the traffic noise.
   Visitors will enter under a sculpted arch. Inscribed on the
walls inside are about 400 names, representing some of the victims
who passed through Umschlagplatz. Previously, a small tablet marked
the site.
   About 450,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding countryside
were crowded into the Warsaw Ghetto after the 1939 Nazi occupation.
The Nazis enclosed the quarter with a barbed-wired-lined brick wall.
   The railroad siding at the tightly guarded square of
Umschlagplatz _ German for ``deportation point'' _ was the only
exit for 300,000 Jews, who there were loaded onto boxcars bound for
the Treblinka and Majdanek death camps.
   Ms. Szmalenberg said she was skeptical of official promises that
the station later would be shut down for good.
   The pumps have been taken down but the office has not been
touched, standing only about a dozen yards from the monument.
   ``Even the Warsaw authorities are not strong enough to get the
gasoline people to change their mind,'' she said.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban, asked about it on Tuesday,
said, ``I really don't understand _ and you must pardon me for this
_ what the problem is, because it concerns some technical details.''
   If the filling station poses an obstacle to the monument itself,
``then it goes without saying that it will be closed down for
good,'' he said. But if the station is just an impediment to the
ceremonies, ``it is a different matter.''

<TEXT>
   Less than 24 hours after the signing of the Geneva
accords on Afghanistan, Tass accused the United States on Friday of
trying to ruin the agreement by continuing to supply weapons to the
Moslem insurgents.
   ``Washington is confirming its policy of neoglobalism, a course
of export of counter-revolution,'' the news agency said in the
first official Soviet press commentary issued since the signing of
the pact in the Swiss city.
   Tass said private and public figures from various countries had
hailed the agreement, which paves the way for the May 15 start of
the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops now in
Afghanistan.
   But, Tass said, the U.S. government has been reacting ``in a
typical Washington manner.''
   It said the U.S. government was interfering in Afghan-Soviet
relations by insisting the Soviet Union stop its military aid to
Afghanistan's Marxist government in Kabul.
   U.S. officials have said they will continue aiding the
guerrillas as long as Soviet military supplies to the regime of
President Najib continue.
   Similar American interference continues in other regional
conflicts in the Middle East, Central America and Africa, where the
United States is using ``illegal, unclean practices'' to bring
about a situation favorable to itself, Tass said.
   The Soviet Union and United States signed agreements in Geneva
on Thursday pledging to guarantee Pakistani and Afghan observance
of the settlement of the 10-year-old Afghan conflict.
   It said that if Pakistan and Afghanistan strictly observe the
Geneva agreement's prohibition against interference in each other's
affairs, Washington's military support of the guerrillas, funneled
through Pakistan, ``will not have a decisive influence.''
   However, a separate Tass commentary expressed concern about
Pakistan's position as stated by President Mohammed Zia Ul-Haq.
   ``The ink hadn't dried on the Geneva agreements, in which the
sides obliged not to offer their territory for hostile actions
against other countries, when the Pakistani president undertook to
aid the mujahadeen in the struggle for the armed overthrow of the
Kabul administration.'' Tass said.
   It called the Pakistani position ``irresponsible.''
   The mujahadeen guerrillas, based in Pakistan, have rejected the
Geneva agreements and vowed to drive the Kabul government from
power.
   The Soviets sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to
preside over the replacement of one Marxist leader by another. They
stayed to help combat a nationwide insurgency.
   Also Friday, a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman said the number
of Soviet soldiers killed and injured in Afghanistan will be
disclosed during the troop withdrawal.
   Spokesman Vadim Perfiliev told reporters at a regular news
briefing that Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze had promised
disclosure of the figures while in Geneva for the signing of the
Afghan agreement.
   Perfiliev was asked at the briefing whether he believes Soviet
citizens, who have never been informed of casualties during the
Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, have the right to know the full
costs of the war.
   ``Of course,'' he replied. ``As far as concrete figures are
concerned, as the foreign minister mentioned yesterday in Geneva,
the number of Soviet troops in Afghanistan and other figures on
that score, casualties, will be published simultaneously with the
process of withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.''
   Western officials estimate that at least 10,000 Soviets have
been killed in the war, and about 25,000 wounded.

<HEAD>Bush: Noriega Getting Libyan Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush said Friday that
``millions of dollars'' from Libya is helping Panamanian strongman
Antonio Manuel Noriega resist U.S. efforts to force him out of the
country.
   Still, Bush told the American Society of Newspaper Editors,
``Noriega should go and Noriega will go.''
   Bush cited ``several reliable sources'' for his information but
did not elaborate. State Department spokesman Charles Redman
indicated he had no further information on Bush's allegation.
   The vice president labeled Democratic charges that the
administration had propped up Noriega as ``demagogic statements''
and declared: ``It is this administration that has brought Noriega
to justice, or at least taken the first step.''
   Meanwhile, Pat Robertson, Bush's only remaining rival for the
Republican presidential nomination, told the same audience that
Bush's popularity stemmed almost entirely from his association with
President Reagan.
   ``George Bush was regarded as `Reagan the Second,''' Robertson
said. He acknowledged there was no way to deny Bush the GOP
nomination.
   ``It is obvious from the delegate count that has come out that
George Bush is going to be the nominee of the Republican Party
absent any unexpected eventuality,'' the former television minister
said.
   About his own camapign, Robertson said, ``I really don't think
looking now at the results that anything made any difference.
George Bush ran a superb campaign. And I had no conception that he
had adopted the Reagan mantle in so total a way.''
   Still, Robertson indicated he was not ready to abandon his
effort, saying he hoped to ``energize the people who support me''
to play a role in the GOP convention in August. However, he said he
would support the party nominee in November.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Bob Dole, who withdrew from the race earlier
this month, said he was ready to help Bush before the convention.
   Bush and Dole had lunch in the Capitol Friday with Republican
senators and former senators, including White House Chief of Staff
Howard Baker.
   In a unity meeting staged for television cameras and reporters,
Dole and Bush stood side-by-side behind Dole's desk and said they
were ready to work together.
   ``Yes, we had differences, some would say shades of
differences,'' Dole said. But ``we're ready to go to work for
George Bush.''
   Bush, in turn, said ``Nobody possibly could have been more
gracious than Bob Dole.''
   Bush also planned a private meeting later in the day at his
residence with former President Richard Nixon.
   The vice president opened his speech by greeting ``the editors
of the nation's finest newspapers _ and also those who publish
Doonesbury,'' a lighthearted reference to the syndicated comic
strip by G.B. Trudeau that frequently has poked fun at Bush.
   In a speech that focused on foreign policy, Bush cited the
administration's efforts to ``protect civilian rule in Panama
against Noriega.''
   ``So far he has stood up to the considerable economic pressures
we have applied, and I can tell you one reason why,'' Bush said.
``Several reliable sources indicate that he is receiving millions
of dollars in support from Libya.''
   Later, at a State Department briefing, spokesman Redman was
asked about Bush's allegations. He shrugged his shoulders,
indicating that he had no information on the matter.
   However, last month it was reported that a Panamanian defense
force major who defected told U.S. officials that he had been sent
to Cuba in early March to pick up a $50 million payment for Noriega
from Libya, but that the funds were never transferred.
   Bush also reiterated his contention that he did not know about
Noriega's involvement in drugs until the Panamanian leader's
indictment in the United States in March. ``In terms of Noriega,
those are the facts,'' he said.
   In response to a question, Bush also said that the
administration is ``purusing every lead, going down every rabbit
trail, running into dead ends'' in efforts to free hostages being
held in Lebanon, including Terry Anderson, the Associated Press'
Middle East correspondent.
   ``There aren't any easy answers,'' he said, suggesting that poor
intelligence-gathering in the Middle East is making it difficult
``even to find where these people are.''

<TEXT>
   Contra rebel leaders returning to
Managua on Friday, some after years in exile, can expect to find
considerably more misery but not many tangible changes in their
capital.
   The trip by the directorate of the Miami-based Nicaraguan
Resistance was to further work started last month to reach a
lasting cease-fire and end more than six years of civil war.
   Just a few months back such a visit seemed impossible.
   But haggling and compromise on both sides, coupled with a need
to end the grueling war, made the trip a necessity.
   The Contras 45-member delegation will find that the leftist
Sandinistas still maintain a firm control on the day-to-day
workings of the government, although their popularity has slipped.
   The capital still is dusty and hot this time of year, though
increased poverty and population are evident.
   Vast open lots left barren since the 1972 earthquake have not
been filled. The walls of homes and buildings bear pro-Sandinista
and Marxist grafitti. A steep hillside bears the initials of the
Sandinista party.
   A large black iron statue in a downtown plaza shows a fighter
with one fist in the air, the other arm raised and holding a
Soviet-designed AK-47 rifle. Red-and-black Sandinista flags fly
everywhere.
   Thousands of people, most from the rural north, flooded into the
capital and its environs to escape the ravages of war. Managua is
home to about a third of the nation's population of 3 million.
Wooden shacks sit in dusty lots.
   Water has been rationed for the past few years. Some
neighborhoods do without for as little as two days a week, while
others receive water only a few hours per week.
   There are shortages of everything from spare parts for cars to
the basics of rice and beans.
   Discontent was on the rise earlier this year because of the
economic conditions, the scarcities and the mandatory draft. But
attitudes changed last month when the cease-fire talks made it seem
that peace could be a reality.
   The mood in the capital has been one of guarded hope, with most
residents acknowledging there never has been a point so close to
ending the war.
   The Contra delegation was headed by the Resistance's board, made
up of Adolfo Calero, Aristides Sanchez, Alfredo Cesar, Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro and Maria Azucena Ferrey.
   All of the directorate members, except for Ms. Ferrey, come from
upper crust Nicaraguan families.
   Calero went into exile in 1982 and was the political head of the
largest Contra group, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, based in
Honduras. He holds a law degree and headed the Coca-Cola Co. of
Nicaragua.
   He opposed the former government of dictator Anastasio Somoza,
ousted by the Sandinistas in 1979. But he later called the ruling
Sandinista National Liberation Front a group of Marxists.
   Sanchez left Nicaragua for Honduras, where he was responsible
for Contra logistics. He is considered a stauch nationalist and a
pragmatic and sensible negotiator.
   Cesar joined the Sandinistas in 1978 and after the revolution
became executive director of the International Construction Fund.
He also served as head of the Central Bank.
   He left Nicaragua in 1982, saying the Sandinistas were Marxists,
and moved to Costa Rica. He worked with the government there and
later joined the Contras operating on the southern front.
   Chamorro, whose family owns the opposition newspaper La Prensa,
went into exile in 1984. His brother, Carlos Fernando, is editor of
the Sandinista newspaper Barricada. One of his sisters is the
ambassador to Costa Rica.
   Ms. Ferrey was the latest to join the directorate, having stayed
in Nicaragua until last year. She was staunchly opposed to Somoza
and reportedly aided some of the Sandinistas during their guerrilla
campaign against him.
   A member of the Social Christian Party, she comes from a
middle-class family and became a vocal internal Sandinista critic.

<HEAD>Businesses Plan to Boost Capital Spending 8 Percent</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businesses plan to increase capital spending
by 8 percent this year, the government reported Friday, raising
hopes that manufacturers will expand factory capacity enough to
ease long-term inflation pressures.
   The Commerce Department said U.S. companies expect to spend
$419.9 billion, after adjustments for inflation, on expansion and
modernization this year. If realized, that would be the best gain
since a 9.6 percent rise in 1985.
   Businesses spent $388.7 billion last year, a 1.7 percent
increase over 1986.
   The new estimate for 1988, based on a survey completed in March,
represented an increase over a survey finished in November, when
businesses said they planned to spend 7.3 percent more.
   ``That's good for inflation in the longer term,'' said Maury
Harris, chief economist of PaineWebber in New York. ``That added
capacity helps meet demand. ... If they weren't increasing their
capital spending, I'd worry.''
   A separate report by the Labor Department on Friday, showing
wholesale prices advancing at a 7 percent annual rate, renewed
inflation fears among investors.
   Adding to the concern is the fact that the operating rate at
factories, at 82.4 percent of capacity in February, is the highest
in eight years. The Federal Reserve plans to release data for March
on Monday.
   Lawrence Chimerine, president of the Wefa Group, a
Philadelphia-area forecasting firm, said if businesses follow
through on their plans, they will be able to produce more.
   ``Most of the capital spending that companies are involved in is
for equipment, a lot of it for replacing older, less-efficient
equipment that they had been using for years ... In the long run,
it's very positive for improving productivity,'' Chimerine said.
   The capital spending survey also eases fears running in the
other direction _ that dampened consumer demand would lead to a
recession this year.
   Economists are looking to manufacturing for export and capital
spending to keep the economy growing. The cheaper dollar is
creating more demand overseas for U.S.-manufactured goods and
capital spending is increasing so factories can meet that demand.
   In 1986, investment spending fell by 2.6 percent as American
companies battled stiff foreign competition.
   For 1988, manufacturing firms expected to boost spending by 8.9
percent, after a 1.1 percent increase last year.
   The anticipated growth this year includes a 6.5 percent boost by
firms making durable goods, items expected to last three or more
years, and an 11.2 percent advance at companies making non-durable
goods.
   Non-manufacturing industries projected an increase in investment
spending of 7.5 percent, with mining, transportation, utility and
other commercial firms all expecting gains.
   Utility companies predicted the smallest increase in 1988, 1.9
percent, after a 0.6 percent drop in spending in 1987.

   Brazilian singer and composer Nelson
Ned shot and wounded his girlfriend, apparently after a lovers'
quarrel, police said Friday.
   The 40-year-old singer is famous for his romantic ballads, many
of which he sings in Spanish. He is widely popular among Latin
American communities in Florida and New York.
   Ned shot Maria Aparecida Rodrigues, 32, wounding her in the
chest on Sunday, said police inspector Adolpho de Andrade Rebello.
Ms. Rodrigues, who has lived with Ned for the past eight years, was
``out of danger'' after being treated, he said.
   Rebello said police wanted to question Ned to determine whether
the shooting was accidental or premeditated.
   He said the singer was in Dallas, according to his lawyer.
   ``But we also have information he may be in Rio de Janeiro or
hiding somewhere in Sao Paulo.''
   The police inspector said Ned could be sentenced to up one year
in prison if the shooting was accidental and up to 20 years if it
was attempted homicide.

<HEAD>Widow Wins Early Round In Battle To Cash In 50-Year-Old Cuban
Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elderly widow has won the first round in her
legal battle against a bank and the government to cash in $127,000
worth of half-century-old bonds issued by the Republic of Cuba.
   The ruling led the woman's lawyer to wonder what happened to the
millions of dollars that should have been in a bank account to back
the $1,000-face-value bonds. It also has fueled speculation in the
bonds.
   The 1937 $85 million bond issue matured in 1977.
   Manufacturers Hanover Trust of New York was an indentured
trustee for part of the bond issue, meaning the Cuban government
contracted to pay a set amount to Manufacturers Hanover, which
would pay the bondholders. The government of Fidel Castro stopped
making payments in 1960.
   When Margarita Rosa De Cuellar, 77, of Virginia Gardens in Dade
County, applied to Manufacturers Hanover in early 1987 to redeem
the bonds, which she inherited from her mother, the bank refused.
   The federal Office of Foreign Assets Control told her the bank
was correct in refusing to redeem the bonds, because they were
considered frozen under the Trading with the Enemy Act.
   Mrs. De Cuellar filed suit in September, and U.S. District Judge
C. Clyde Atkins ruled March 13 that she was entitled to the money
because the United States unreasonably considered all the bonds,
even those held by U.S. residents, as frozen assets.
   An American resident shouldn't be stopped from seeking payment
from an American institution, the judge decreed.
   ``This court recognizes the importance of providing the
president with flexibility in his negotiations with the Cuban
government. However, the United States may only use those assets
that are not property of American residents,'' he wrote in his
order.
   Attorneys for the government and Manufacturers Hanover Trust
asked to delay payment to Mrs. De Cuellar pending a decision on
whether to appeal. Her lawyer, Alex Arandia, filed a counter motion
asking that they pay immediately. No court date has been set on the
motions.
   ``There's many unidentified holders of these bonds. ... We don't
know who they are,'' Julian Kroeger, an attorney for the bank, told
the judge.
   Estimating there are $44 million in bonds in circulation in this
country, the bank says there is only about $1.5 million in the fund
to pay off bondholders.
   Arandia, Mrs. De Cuellar's lawyer, said he wants a full
accounting of the bond fund, arguing that according to the payment
schedule, the bank should have received $40 million by 1960.
   Although the bond issue was to mature in 1977, Arandia said that
as far as he can determine his client appears to be the first to
ever try to redeem any of the bonds, meaning the question of
whether they could be redeemed had never been asked before.
   ``It's very strange,'' he said Friday of the entire case.
   The federal Office of Foreign Assets Control was not happy with
the judge's ruling. ``The court's decision could become a vehicle
enabling Cuba to obtain U.S. dollars,'' said agency spokesman R.
Richard Newcombe.
   In the meantime, speculators have been snapping up the old bonds
and trading them on the New York Stock Exchange, with hopes of a
thaw in relations between Cuba and the United States.
   Before Atkins' ruling, the bonds traded for $200, but a week
later they traded for $450.

<TEXT>
   The artistic freedom fostered by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev brought the work of Spanish surrealist Salvador Dali out
of a ``zone of silence'' to Soviets for the first time Friday, the
head of the host museum said.
   Irina A. Antonova, the director of the Pushkin Museum of Fine
Arts, said Dali's nightmarish style in sculpture, painting and
graphics had been off limits in the Soviet Union.
   ``The creative work of the surrealists, including Dali to some
extent, belonged to a zone of silence of such themes of art that
were closed until recent times,'' said Antonova.
   Gorbachev's ``glasnost'' policy of more openness has encouraged
intellectuals and artists to explore previously forbidden themes in
their work, and Antonova said the display of Dali's work represents
a break from conservative policies of Soviet museums.
   ``Very many blank spots in literature, art and cinematography
are being opened for our audiences,'' she said. ``And I would
assume that the work of Dali now should be placed in that context.''
   Before Gorbachev, Soviet media blasted Dali as decadent and
degenerate and did not publish any reproductions of his work.
   The Pushkin Museum kicked off its display of 160 Dali graphics
and a few sculptures from the collection of Frenchman Pierre
Argillet with private showings for Soviet and foreign journalists
and for invited dignitaries such as government officials.
   The one-month exhibition opens to the public Saturday, but
people began lining up Friday during a snowstorm in hopes of
getting into the museum, a few blocks from the Kremlin. They were
told tickets won't go on sale until Saturday.
   Long lines are common at most cultural events involving foreign
artists. Antonova bristled when asked if it would be difficult for
people to get tickets.
   ``They will get tickets just like everywhere, as in Paris, New
York or Munich, people will stand at the cashier's booth, buy
tickets and go to the exhibit,'' she said, declining to say how
many people would be allowed to view the exhibit daily.
   Argillet, 78, said Soviet officials became interested in his
collection of Dali's sketches after musicians from the Soviet
Conservatory and dancers from the Kirov and Bolshoi ballets saw the
works in the Frenchman's home, the Chateau de Vaux le Penil in
Melun, 24 miles southeast of Paris. He signed a contract for the
Pushkin exhibition in October with the Soviet Culture Ministry.
   Argillet, a publisher of Dali's works, said the 84-year-old
artist is in poor health in Spain and couldn't attend the Moscow
showing, but would be pleased it was taking place.
   Some Soviets said they regretted that the exhibition was limited
to Dali's etchings and drawings from the 1960s and did not include
his better-known and more colorful paintings.

<TEXT>
   High school administrators have promised
to review the way drum majorettes are chosen after 25 to 30
students staged a walkout when the squad's first and only black
member was dropped.
   The students chanted ``We want Mazy'' as they left classes at
Baker County High School for about an hour Thursday in the school
and were joined at a schoolyard fence by 10 to 15 parents.
   Mazy Ruise, 15, a sophomore, has been a majorette for the past
two years, but did not make the squad for the 1988-89 school year.
She is the 10-member squad's first and only black member.
   ``All of the kids in the band felt Mazy was highly qualified to
return to the majorette group,'' said Gail Moore, a parent.
   ``I feel I've been treated unfairly,'' said Miss Ruise, the only
black to try out for the 1988-89 squad. She said she was touched
when she saw that parents and students gathered at the fence to
protest the decision.
   The school's enrollment of 1,000 students is 17 percent black.
   Gail Brown, a guidance counselor who is serving as acting
principal, met with students and parents at the Thursday protest.
   After complaints that Miss Ruise had been unfairly treated, Ms.
Brown agreed to review ``the whole situation concerning Mazy'' and
the school's policies for majorette selection.
   The walkout ``did not totally disrupt the school,'' Ms. Brown
said. Students returned to school after missing just one class
Thursday, and the school day went on normally on Friday, she said.
   Students who tried out for the majorette squad last month did
dance and twirling routines and then were ranked by scores tallied
by four judges, all white. Two of the judges were from dance
studios and two were former majorettes.
   Mazy was ranked 11th of the 14 students who tried out. Ten were
chosen.
   ``I've been twirling since I was 6. ... I'm not bragging, but
I'm better than all of them,'' Miss Ruise said.
   Tajuana Spencer, 16, who participated in the protest, agreed
that Miss Ruise had been treated unfairly. ``They knew she was
good,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The percentage of adults who say they are going
out less because of economic concerns has doubled in the last five
months, but consumers are spending more on gourmet food to enjoy
their evenings in, according to a nationwide survey.
   Thirty-two percent of 500 adults around the country questioned
last week by a consulting company said they are staying home more
since last fall, because of the economy. Decision Research Corp.'s
first poll of 3,500 people in November and December found only 16
percent staying home more often.
   ``Many people are focusing on their own household and their
personal finances,'' said Carol Hess, a research consultant at the
Lexington-based firm. ``But also the level of concern about the
overall economy has not dropped off.''
   On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 indicating most concern, an
average of 6.38 was registered in April among respondents asked
about the state of the national economy, compared with 6.23 last
fall. Concern for the global economy ranked 5.73 in the recent
survey and 5.79 last fall.
   Parents under 40 years old earning less than $40,000 annually
were most likely to stay at home. Only 7 percent of older
respondents with yearly incomes over $40,000 indicated they are
staying home more, she said.
   ``Having made the point that the anxiety level about the economy
has not diminished, people are also stating clearly that they have
changed their behavior patterns,'' Hess said.
   The DRC survey, launched several weeks after the Oct. 19, 1987,
stock market collapse, has spanned a period in which real estate
markets softened in some areas and several economists offered
predictions of a return to inflation or recession.
   While 9 percent of respondents last year said they had changed
plans regarding major expenditures such as homes and vacations
because of economic worries, the number rose to 17 percent in DRC's
April survey.
   Hess said DRC undertook the study on its own and sells results
to manufacturers and marketing firms interested in gauging consumer
trends.
   ``I think the people particularly interested is the leisure and
home food industry,'' said Hess. ``There seems to be an impact in
fancy foods and takeout food. It fits in with the `couch potato'
trend, but if people are going to stay at home they don't want to
just vegetate.
   ``They want fun things to do. It seems there will be a
significant impact in home entertainment, kids' games, books.''
   A DRC report issued last month indicated only 12 percent of
1,000 adults questioned said watching television was their
principal evening activity. Most told DRC pollsters they combine
television viewing with other activities, such as cooking, cleaning
and doing crafts, said Hess.
   In the April survey, two-thirds of respondents reported that
their spending habits have changed since last fall.
   Items being purchased more include gourmet food and home
improvement gadgets. On the decline are clothing, standard food and
``even 2 percent said they were cutting back on necessity items,''
said Hess.
   ``It seems to be that people are saying, `Well, if I'm going to
be staying home, I'm going to have fancier food or more enjoyable
things to do,''' she said.

<HEAD>Four Die in Rioting to Protest Higher Gasoline Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said six people died during a violent
demonstration against increases in gasoline prices, the News Agency
of Nigeria reported Friday.
   Police said they used force to quell a riot that had degenerated
into ``complete lawlessness.''
   Nigerian newspapers had reported Thursday that police shot four
people to death in the northern city of Jos. Authorities closed
half a dozen colleges and universities, including the University of
Lagos, to halt the spread of protests.
   The Plateau state police command said the dead included a police
constable and a retired police inspector, the news agency said.
   ``The command unequivocally believes that it will not allow a
situation where there is a complete breakdown of law and order,
resulting in a state of anarchy,'' according to the police
statement.
   The statement also confirmed that rioters burned down two court
buildings, a metropolitan development board building, police
station, local government secretariat and the state fire office.
   Police blocked rioters from burning down the city's main market,
a bank and divisional police headquarters, the statement said.
   The news agency said businesses had reopened in Jos and life was
returning to normal Friday.
   Gasoline prices were raised 3 percent last weekend by the
military government, which is under pressure from Western creditors
to raise money to meet a $1.5 billion budget deficit.
   Although the price increases appear small, transport companies
subsequently raised bus prices from 50 percent to 100 percent in
some areas.
   Since the oil boom days of the mid-1970s, Nigerians have come to
regard cheap gasoline as a fundamental right. Even with the
increases, gasoline costs about 40 cents a gallon.

   Imprisoned auto heir John Francis
Dodge must pay his ex-wife more than $50,000 in alimony and
attorney fees and $1,200 a month in child support, a judge has
ruled.
   Palm Beach Circuit Judge John D. Wessel on Thursday ordered
Dodge to begin making the monthly payments to Karen Christine Dodge
on June 1. They were married in September 1979, and he filed for
divorce in December 1984.
   ``I think it's very fair except it's going to be a problem
trying to collect it,'' said Joseph Farish, attorney for Ms. Dodge.
   Dodge, the grandson of auto tycoon Horace Dodge Sr., began
serving a one-year prison term April 1 for violating probation in a
1985 drug case.
   Dodge told attorneys he will inherit $1.1 million from a trust
on his 35th birthday, March 14, 1989. The child support payments
for his 6-year-old son and ``any arrearages'' accumulated by that
date will be deducted from the trust fund, the judge said.

   For 50 years people have wondered: Did Rhett
Butler and Scarlett O'Hara ever get back together, or was it all
over for the tempestuous lovers of ``Gone With the Wind'' when
Rhett walked out the door.
   Margaret Mitchell never told, and now the answer is up to
Alexandra Ripley, a Virginia author chosen by Miss Mitchell's
estate to write the sequel to the Civil War-era epic.
   Ms. Ripley isn't saying what she'll do, but her novel appears
certain to be a multimillion-dollar production that the
luxury-loving Scarlett would have appreciated.
   Officials of the William Morris Agency in New York, which is
handling the book for the Mitchell estate, said publishers are
reading the first two chapters this week and next and will bid on
the book at an auction in a week to 10 days. It is to be published
in 1990.
   ``I just can't talk price because we just don't know,'' said
Robert Gottlieb of the Morris agency, who represents Ms. Ripley.
But he said the auction price was sure to be ``in a substantial
multiple of millions.'' Life magazine predicted it could hit $6
million.
   Ms. Ripley told Life, which has contracted to run excerpts of
the sequel, that she will take about 18 months to write the
1,000-page, still-untitled book.
   ``This one will never be mine,'' she said. ``It's a foster
mother kind of thing. I am trying to prepare myself for a universal
hatred of what I'm going to do. Yes, Margaret Mitchell writes
better than I do _ but she's dead.''
   Miss Mitchell, who was killed by an Atlanta taxi in 1949,
refused to write a sequel to her 1936 novel, saying the story had
reached its ``natural and proper ending.''
   But her estate announced last year that it had begun work on an
authorized novel continuing the tale of Scarlett and Rhett.
   T. Hal Clarke, an attorney for the estate, said Stephens
Mitchell, the author's brother, reluctantly agreed before his death
in 1983 that the family must proceed with the book to prevent a
flood of unauthorized sequels when the ``Gone With the Wind''
copyright expires in 2011.
   Clarke said Friday that he was pleased with the selection of Ms.
Ripley from a dozen authors.
   ``Of course, we're prejudiced down here in Atlanta about
Margaret Mitchell,'' he said, ``and I think Alexandra herself
realizes she may not measure up _ indeed she said so. But having
said that, in our day and time I think she is an extremely talented
lady and will do the most credible sequel that we could come out
with.''
   Clarke said the family will give Ms. Ripley a free hand,
although the estate set broad guidelines for the book and has a
right to refuse her manuscript if she steps outside those
parameters.
   ``We didn't want any hilariously raw sex,'' he said.
   Ms. Ripley, a Charleston, S.C., native who wants to keep her
current hometown in Virginia a secret, promised there won't be any.
   She told Life she will write more openly about sex than Miss
Mitchell did, but ``I don't do graphic descriptions of what people
do to one another. It makes me snicker.''
   She said she also will not imitate the thick slave dialect of
the original because ``I find it hard to read, and black people
find it demeaning.''
   Although Ms. Ripley is keeping her plot secret, she suggested
Charleston, Rhett's hometown, would figure in the sequel.
   ``Can you imagine Scarlett in old Charleston?'' she asked in an
interview with The (Charleston) News and Courier. ``Can you see her
and Rhett going to the St. Cecilia Ball? Hmmmmmm. `Oh, fiddlededee,
who IS that strange person?' I just don't see how I can resist
having a little touch of Charleston in the book!''
   Ms. Ripley, 54, grew up in Charleston as Alexandra Braid and
attended Vassar College on a scholarship from the United Daughters
of the Confederacy. She has written four historical novels,
``Charleston, ``On Leaving Charleston,'' ``New Orleans Legacy'' and
``The Time Returns.''

<TEXT>
   The execution of Earl Clanton Jr., a
participant in the largest escape of condemned prisoners in U.S.
history, leaves three of the six inmates who fled the Mecklenburg
Correctional Center in 1984 still on death row.
   Clanton, 33, was put to death late Thursday night after final
appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay and to Gov. Gerald L.
Baliles for clemency were turned down.
   Clanton, who said he lived a troubled childhood that included
beatings by his father and sexual abuse by his stepmother, was
sentenced to die for robbing and killing a neighbor, Wilhelmina
Smith, in November 1980. The 38-year-old victim, a Petersburg
school librarian, was strangled, stabbed and robbed of $8.
   Before he died, Clanton expressed remorse for the murder, said
Ignacio Carrion, a Washington-based reporter for Spanish television
who interviewed Clanton just hours before the execution.
   ``He said he felt sorry for strangling the woman,'' said
Carrion. ``He was very articulate. He showed no fear of dying, but
he felt apprehensive, obviously.''
   During the trial, Clanton had denied killing the woman, saying
he got blood on his clothing because he had tried to help defend
her against two intruders.
   Clanton and five other death row inmates staged a daring escape
from prison on May 31, 1984. All six were recaptured within a
month, with Clanton being one of the first two caught as they were
drinking wine and eating cheese outside a coin laundry in
Warrenton, N.C.
   Two of the escapees, brothers Linwood and James Briley, were
executed before Clanton. The other three _ Willie Leroy Jones,
Derick L. Peterson and Lem Tuggle _ are still on death row.
   Previous executions at the aging State Penitentiary in downtown
Richmond, slated to close within two years, have attracted rowdy
crowds of death penalty supporters who yelled epithets at prayer
vigil groups opposed to capital punishment. But the scene Thursday
night was subdued.
   About 75 death penalty foes held a candlelight vigil and sang
``We Shall Overcome.'' Larry Pagnoni, who spoke to the group,
suggested that Virginia's use of executions was racist.
   ``When we use the death penalty, Virginia is in a state of
apartheid, like in South Africa,'' said Pagnoni, director of a
Richmond shelter for the homeless.
   Since 1982, seven death sentences have been carried out in the
state. All of the condemned were men; five of the seven were black,
including Clanton.
   Clanton's death brings to 98 the number of persons executed
since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to restore the death
penalty in 1976. Five of the executions have taken place this year.

   John Seigenthaler, editorial director of USA
Today, was elected president of the 1,000-member American Society
of Newspaper Editors on Friday, stepping in for a Wall Street
Journal editor who was unable to take the job because of health
reasons.
   Seigenthaler, who also is editor and publisher of the Nashville
Tennessean, had been ASNE treasurer.
   Edward R. Cony, associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, who
for the past year served as vice president of the ASNE, was elected
to the presidency, but an ASNE statement said he was resigning the
post.
   By tradition, the vice president usually succeeds to the
presidency. But, the statement said, Cony discovered in early March
that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a progressive brain
cell degeneration that leads to senility. There is no cure for the
disease.
   Katherine Fanning, editor of the Christian Science Monitor and
outgoing ASNE president, announced Cony's election and his decision
to resign at a luncheon on the final day of the ASNE's annual
convention. Cony received a standing ovation.
   Cony, who has been a member of ASNE since 1971, previously
served as the group's secretary and treasurer.
   Other new officers are Loren Ghiglione, editor and publisher of
the Southbridge (Mass.) News, vice president; Burl Osborne, editor
and publisher of The Dallas Morning News, secretary; and David
Lawrence, publisher of The Detroit Free Press, treasurer.

   Mexico reacted angrily Friday to the U.S.
Senate's decision to impose trade and economic sanctions on Mexico
for not doing enough to fight the drug trade.
   However, Mexican officials expressed confidence that President
Reagan will veto the sanctions if they are passed by the House of
Representatives.
   The Foreign Ministry called the U.S. Senate vote an
``intervention'' and said in a formal protest ``no power can claim
for itself the right to certify the conduct of other societies or
governments. No one has the right to impose from abroad conduct,
ideas, political or economic systems on other peoples.''
   On Friday in Washington, the U.S. State Department warned that
the Senate vote to impose sanctions on Mexico actually could lead
to an increase in such traffic.
   ``Far from serving as a catalyst for action, this vote
castigates a friend for less than perfect behavior,'' department
spokesman Charles Redman said.
   The Mexican government places the fight against the drug trade
under the joint command of the Defense Department and the Federal
Attorney General's Office. It also cooperates with the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration, which maintains an office and agents
here.
   The Senate decision did not surprise Mexican officials, but many
said they were disappointed.
   Mexican officials have often been singled out in the United
States by politicians and news media as corrupt and accused of
participating in or permitting drug traffic.
   The Attorney General's Office, which says it has lost more than
30 agents in battles with drug traffickers in the past three years,
issued a stronger statement saying the sacrifice of those who lost
their lives ``does not appear to interest those who condemn an
effort they are ignorant of or prefer to remain ignorant of.''
   It said thousands of Mexicans risk their lives fighting the drug
trade and added, ``All of this is not understood by those who
should recognize the work that our country has undertaken to
protect the lives and health of our own population and of other
communities, particularly in the United States.''
   Mexican officials have tried in the past to avoid direct
confrontation and the exchange of recriminations about who does
more in the fight against drug trafficking.
   Mexicans believe that U.S. politicians and congressmen often use
the drug traffic issue and Mexico as a way to grab the spotlight
and gain publicity.
   Juan Enriquez, spokesman for Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the man
virtually certain to succeed President Miguel de la Madrid in
December, said Friday: ``We are convinced that we must use all of
the power of the Mexican state to fight against production and
transport of drugs not only because this hurts some people in the
United States but because of the damages it can a cause in Mexico.''
   ``But fighting drugs requires the closest collaboration and
should not be an used for political oportunism or grandstanding,''
he said
   Salinas de Gortari has said during his campaign that he
considers the fight against drugs ``a national priority.''
   But he also said recently, ``No country has the political, moral
or judicial authority to grant certificates of good or bad conduct
to other countries.''
   Two months ago Reagan told de la Madrid at their meeting in the
Pacific resort of Mazatlan that he had strived for an ``atmosphere
of cordiality and mutual respect between the two countries.''
   Reagan also praised Mexico's efforts in the war against drug
traffic, and he listened to de la Madrid's reminder of the
pervasive Mexican view that drug consumption in the United States
is as much a part of the problem as production, supply and
trafficking in illicit narcotics.
   ``This final link (consumption in the United States) continues
to have a determining influence in the criminal chain,'' de la
Madrid told Reagan at their meeting.

<HEAD>Education Group: Textbooks Full Of Trivia, Faddism, Inconsistency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most textbooks are lifeless and boring because
state regulations force publishers to cram elementary and secondary
books with ``test-oriented trivia, pedagogical faddism and
inconsistent social messages,'' an education group charged Friday.
   The Council for Basic Education said states should stop issuing
lengthy list of what textbooks must cover, and publishers should
have textbooks written by gifted writers instead of committee.
   In a study called ``A Conspiracy of Good Intentions: America's
Textbook Fiasco,'' the non-profit council said the textbook
selection system ``is perfectly designed to produce textbooks that
confuse, mislead and profoundly bore students.''
   ``Authors and editors do not willingly chop and flatten
sentences, nor do they thoughtlessly mangle storylines,'' it said.
``The source of the writing problem is not in the publishing house,
but in the public agency. Legislators, educational policymakers and
administrative regulators have unintentionally drained the life out
of children's textbooks.''
   It cited one book that rendered the fable of ``The Hare and the
Tortoise'' this way:
   ``Rabbit said: `I can run. I can run fast. You can't run fast.'
   Turtle said, `Look Rabbit. See the park. You and I will run.
We'll run to the park.'
   ``Rabbit said, `I want to stop. I'll stop here. I can run, but
Turtle can't.'
   ```I can get to the park fast.' Turtle said, `I can't run fast.
But I will not stop. Rabbit can't see me. I'll get to the park.'''
   In another instance noted in a recent article in Atlantic
Monthly magazine, a passage from Hans Christian Anderson's ``The
Emperor's New Clothes'' was reduced from the original:
   ```Magnificent!' `Excellent!' `Prodigious!' went from mouth to
mouth, and everyone was exceedingly pleased.''
   To this:
   ```How marvelous,' they echoed the emperor. `How beautiful.'''
   The council said the entire market is hostage to the textbook
adoption method that 22 states use to decide which books their
public schools can buy. Most Southern and Western states, including
Texas and California, have such adoption policies.
   States churn out ``undisciplined lists of particulars that
publishers must include in the textbooks. Since publishers must
sell in as many jurisdictions as possible in order to turn a
profit, their books must incorporate this melange of test-oriented
trivia, pedagogical faddism and inconsistent social messages,'' the
study said.
   ``The harder they try to regulate the content of textbooks, the
less useful textbooks become for their own students and students
elsewhere in the United States,'' said the study.
   The author, Harriet Tyson-Bernstein, said ``readability''
formulas used to judge whether a text is too far over children's
heads are partly to blame for the poor prose.
   ``Another pervasive textbook sin is `mentioning' ... textbook
prose that fits from fact to fact, statement to statement, and
topic to topic, without giving the reader the context that would
make sense of the factual information,'' the study said.
   The study recommended adoption states stop ``issuing detailed,
skill-oriented bid specifications to publishers,'' abandon the
readability formulas and stop demanding a recent publication date,
which ``forces publishers into hasty revisions.''
   It recommended publishers hire authors ``who have demonstrated
their ability to write clear and engaging text for mass
audiences,'' and that they pay scholars, not public school teachers
or education professors, to get the textbooks.
   Tyson-Bernstein, at a briefing for reporters here on Wednesday,
said textbooks ``are too condensed and too compressed ... They are
useful to teachers now, but not very useful to students.'' Teachers
rely heavily on the textbooks in preparing instruction, she said.
   She discussed her findings Friday in New Orleans at a meeting of
the Education Writers Association.
   The average public school district spent $4,000 per child in
1980, but only $34.17 on instructional materials, according to the
American Association of Publishers.
   The council is a three-decade-old group that advocates a liberal
arts curriculum for all students in elementary and secondary
schools.

<HEAD>Carrie Hamilton Plays Familiar Character in First Film</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress-singer Carrie Hamilton, who enjoys
dressing up and pretending to be someone else, says she plays
someone just like herself in her first movie, ``Toyko Pop.''
   ``Wendy is me,'' the 24-year-old daughter of Carol Burnett says
of the character she portrays, an American rocker who finds fame,
love and self-understanding in Japan.
   ``There's nothing she had to go through I didn't know all
about,'' Miss Hamilton said in an interview in the May issue of
Cosmopolitan magazine.
   The movie's director saw a photo of Miss Hamilton, with her
bleached-white spiked hair, and her mother in People magazine and
informed the casting director to judge all aspiring Wendys by the
photograph.
   Later, someone suggested sending the script to Miss Hamilton.
When she read it, she told the magazine, she felt as if she was
reading of a kindred spirit.
   Miss Burnett says it was always easier for her daughter ``to be
somebody else.''
   ``She's like me in that sense,'' the comedian-actress said.
``Rub up against us too close and we turn into somebody else. It
gives us courage to hide behind a mask.''
   For fun, Miss Hamilton says she likes to dress up decadently as
the late Edie Sedgwick, a one-time member of Andy Warhol's crew,
and hit the nightclubs with her boyfriend, a look-alike of the late
artist.

<TEXT>
   Australia will scale down its only
overseas military base Saturday when it begins withdrawing an air
force fighter squadron from Malaysia.
   The withdrawal is part of a redeployment of Australia's front
line fighter force to air bases in northern Australia, which are
being developed at a cost of $75 million.
   The redeployment is the first step in a new program that will
include a new submarine and missile destroyer fleet, half of which
will be based permanently on its west coast.
   Australian Defense Minister Kim Beazley will officiate at
ceremonies at Butterworth air base in Malaysia marking the return
to Australia of the French-designed Mirage fighters.
   Australia is playing down the withdrawal of the fighters,
arguing that its new northern Australia-based U.S. built FA-18
Hornet fighters will be only two hours' flying time from Malaysian
airspace in the event of emergency.
   The FA-18s are to be rotated through Butterworth 16 times a year
under a new agreement with the Malaysian govenrment.
   They will fly from Tindal, a new base south of Darwin in
Australia's Northern Territory.
   Beazley has said Australia also will rotate U.S.-built F-111
strike aircraft through Butterworth, built on Malaysia's west coast
as a Royal Air Force base in 1941, a year before Pearl Harbor.
   It was destroyed by the Japanese in World War II, rebuilt and
later expanded by Australia with a 6,000-foot runway in 1958.

   Eighty young people boarded buses Friday to
escape _ at least for the 10 days of their mountain retreat _ the
turfs of the gangs that bring violence and drugs to their urban
neighborhoods.
   ``The thing I want to get out of this is to better my life,''
15-year-old Michael Williams said as he waited to board one of the
three buses going to the Pocono Mountains in northeastern
Pennsylvania.
   Nearly all the 15- to 20-year-olds taking part in the ``Youth at
Risk'' program have been suspended from school at some point, and
about 30 are serious gang members, said Clinton Terrell, director
of community outreach and enrollment for the program.
   On Thursday, the Pennsylvania Crime Commission issued a report
that said gang violence will soon make organized crime family
activities seem tame.
   The retreat at a camp near Bushwick will included hikes along
with individual and group counseling.
   Some of the young people said they hoped to learn to control
their tempers or do better in school.
   ``I want to keep from getting locked up,'' said 16-year-old
Ronald Bouie.
   David Fisher has run the ``Youth at Risk'' for Breakthrough
Foundation in San Francisco for eight years and said its programs
have been succesful in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit and
other cities. This is the first time the program has been offered
in Philadelphia.
   ``We're going to demand everything you've got, and when you
think you're out of gas, we're going to demand more,'' Fisher
warned Friday morning.
   He asked the youths to refrain from venting their anger with
violence.
   ``You are in a room full of people with short fuses,'' he said.
``This is going to be 10 days of peace. ... It's called growing
up.''
   Fisher said the youths were required to turn in any drugs,
weapons, radios and snack food before they can participate.
   ``What I'm telling you is put down your arms. Put down your
anger. Put down your hatred,'' he said.
   The youths appeared upset by only two of the rules: no snacking
between meals and no music except when the staff provides radios.
   Bennie Swans Jr., executive director of Crisis Intervention
Network, said the program's goal was to relieve tension and despair
among Philadelphia's youths caused by high unemployment and an
increased high school dropout rate.
   Swans said the same type of hopelessness caused gang violence
resulting in a death a week during gang wars in the late 1960s and
early 1970s.
   ``All the problems we had to deal with 20 years ago, we still
have to deal with,'' said Swans, himself a veteran of the city's
gang wars.
   Hazel Floyd said her 18-year-old son, Curtis, came to her with
the idea of participating in the retreat. ``He just felt like he
wants to get away and sit down and think about what he wants to do
in the future,'' she said.
   Terrell said about $300,000 was raised for the program, which
will have 100 volunteers at the site in the Poconos and hold
monthly meetings for a year after the retreat.
   Ben Johnson, 19, of Oakland, Calif., took the course in 1986
when he was a junior in high school and selling cocaine.
   ``Some guys wanted to get me. My money wasn't coming straight.
My parents wanted to throw me out of the house. I was flunking out.
My life wasn't working,'' Johnson told the group.
   After the course, Johnson said, he took a job and finished high
school.
   ``I got dreams now,'' added Johnson, who is spending a year
working with ``Youth at Risk.''

<TEXT>
   An additional 325,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat has been sold to the Soviet Union at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The sale, equal to about 11.9 million bushels, was handled by
Mitsubishi International Corp., 25,000 tons; Cargill Inc., 100,000;
Artfer Inc., 50,000; Garnac Grain Co. Inc., 50,000; and Continental
Grain Co., 100,000.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the grain was sold under terms
of the long-term grain agreement between the United States and the
Soviet Union.
   Sims said the subsidies averaged $24.70 per ton, or about 67
cents per bushel of wheat.
   No selling prices were announced, but wheat has been averaging
about $2.84 per bushel recently, according to the USDA. That could
mean a farm value of about $50 million.
   The U.S.-Soviet pact, which expires Sept. 30, calls on Moscow to
buy at least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that
the purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and
corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting
as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   If more than 12 million tons are wanted in a year, the Soviets
are required to seek U.S. approval. The Soviets were given approval
to exceed the 12 million tons in the final year.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or soybeans.
   So far, the Soviets have bought more than 8.8 million tons of
subsidized wheat for delivery in the fifth year, as well as 4.1
million tons of non-subsidized corn; 818,400 tons of U.S. soybeans
and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.
   Subsidies are provided under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP. Private exporters are given surplus commodities
owned by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. so they can sell a
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive
world prices.
   The subsidies, or bonuses, have run between less than $20 to
more than $40 per ton, roughly 54 cents to $1.09 per bushel.
   Sims said the Soviets have more than 185,000 tons remaining in
their current EEP authorization. An additional 1 million tons were
announced on April 4, plus some left over from earlier
authorizations.

<HEAD>Critics Want Human Rights Attached to Creation of `Zone of Trust'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Czechoslovak human rights group has
called on its government to release all political prisoners and
allow free travel abroad before a government-proposed ``zone of
trust'' is created in central Europe.
   ``If trust is not to remain a mere propagandistic slogan,
certain basic preconditions must be fulfilled for it to emerge,''
said the appeal from the Charter 77 group. A text was released
Friday through the London-based Palach Press newsletter.
   The document was signed by three Charter 77 spokesmen and issued
in Prague on April 11. It welcomed a Czechoslovak government
proposal to set up a ``zone of trust and good neighborly relations
along the dividing lines of the Warsaw Pact and NATO countries'' in
central Europe.
   Czechoslovak Communist Party leader Milos Jakes made the
proposal in February, but no details have been made public.
   Prague officials said the buffer zone, to include such countries
as West and East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Austria, would cover
cultural, military, ecological and human relations issues.
   The Charter 77 appeal calls on the Czechoslovak government to
prove its ``trustworthiness and credibility by respecting the
fundamental rights and liberties of its citizens while submitting
itself to open and public scrutiny.''
   A copy was sent to Jakes and to the Helsinki follow-up
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna,
   As reported by Palach Press, signatories Milos Hajek, Stanislav
Devaty and Bohumir Janat specifically demanded the immediate
release of Jiri Wolf, who is serving a six-year sentence for
publishing information on conditions in Czechoslovak prisons. He
was jailed in 1983.
   They also demanded that priest Stefan Javorsky, sentenced to
eight months in jail last year for celebrating Mass without
official permission, be set free.
   The appeal also demanded freedom to travel abroad, in particular
to the couuntries included in the proposed trust zone; an end to
discrimination against nonconformist citizens; and a halt to
persecuting human rights groups.
   ``If the government does not take decisive steps in the spirit
of the above-mentioned points, its peace proposal will remain a
mere empty gesture,'' the signatories of the appeal said, according
to Palach Press.

   Cosmetic surgery is as common as palm trees in
movieland, but one blemished star on the Walk of Fame took 28 years
to fix.
   Mauritz Stiller, the late Swedish director whose main claim to
fame was bringing Greta Garbo to Hollywood, suffered the indignity
of having not just one name misspelled on the famed star-walk, but
both.
   City officials corrected the error Thursday, replacing a star
plaque reading Maurice Diller with one honoring Mauritz Stiller.
   In 1960, when the first 1,550 bronze plaques were implanted in
the sidewalks of Hollywood's shopping and theater district to
create the hallowed Walk of Fame, someone taking the name over the
telephone misheard the caller, said Bill Welsh, president of the
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
   ``Well, we got 1,549 stars out of 1,550 correct,'' Welsh said.
``I just hope our Swedish friends will forgive us for taking so
long to correct the error.''
   The local Swedish consulate had asked Hollywood to correct the
misspelling because King Carl XVI Gustav and Queen Silvia, who are
touring the United States, will be visiting California soon, said
spokesman Claes Jernaeus.
   Stiller was lured to Hollywood in 1925 by MGM's Louis B. Mayer,
and came only on condition that he could bring Miss Garbo. She went
on to become a star, but Stiller contracted pleurisy and returned
to Sweden, where he died in 1928.
   He directed such films as ``Sir Arne's Treasure'' and ``The
Atonement of Gosta Berling,'' which starred Miss Garbo.
   Attending the ceremonies were Swedish notables Lasse Hallstrom,
the Oscar-nominated director of ``My Life As A Dog,'' and actress
Signe Hasso. Miss Garbo had been invited to attend, but ``she's
very private, as you know. And she's over 80 now,'' said Ake
Sandler, a local Swedish-born professor.

   It looks like someone drove a car into a
tree and left it there, but nature is responsible for a hybrid 1928
Ford Coupe and a Chinese elm tree in Ermal and James Wilson's field.
   Mrs. Wilson, of Inavale, bought the used Ford in 1944 for $125.
She was working as a waitress for $4 a week. She married Wilson in
1945 and three years later he gave her a 1948 Studebaker. That's
when the Ford got the shaft.
   ``We built a new garage for the Studebaker to go in and I drove
it (the Ford) out there (in the field),'' she said. ``It wasn't
long before a tree grew up in the middle of it. The transmission is
in the tree.
   ``The roof was still on it but of course the tree pushed it
off,'' Mrs. Wilson said. Nature's hold was final when another tree
grew behind the car's rear axle.
   ``It was in perfect shape when I parked it there,'' she said.
``If I had any brains, as they say now, I should have parked it in
the garage and parked the new Studebaker outside.''

   Greta knocks on the back door with her horns
and plays with the family dogs, but she isn't a billy goat. She's a
bison fast closing in on 700 pounds who likes being petted, fed and
talked to.
   ``She thinks she's a person,'' said Martin Kimmet, a rancher who
raises buffalo for slaughter. ``She still wants to come in the
house every time she sees the door opened.''
   Greta entered the Kimmet household several years ago after her
mother deserted the calf shortly after birth.
   ``The difficult labor apparently caused her to abandon her
calf,'' Kimmet said. ``After we had given her about two hours to
`mother up,' we brought her into our house.''
   At first Greta was no trouble. Weighing only about 50 pounds,
she was the size of a large dog. The family later blocked off a
section of the house for her because she woke earlier than the
family and demanded to be fed. She eventually was moved out to the
yard, where the family continues to treat her like a pet.
   Kimmet is not yet sure of Greta's future, although he is
thinking of using her for public relations. However, he has ruled
out one possibility:
   ``We wouldn't want to eat this one,'' said Kimmet.

<HEAD>U.S. Rice Exports Could Blossom in Face of World Supply Shortage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American rice farmers may benefit in the early
months of the 1988-89 season from a shortage of exportable crops in
competing nations, an Agriculture Department report said Friday.
   World rice production from the 1987-88 harvests is forecast at
304 million metric tons, milled equivalent, down 4 percent from
last year, the department's Economic Research Service said. Weak
monsoons left Asian producers with limited supplies.
   Meanwhile, global rice consumption is expected to increase 3
percent, leaving world stockpiles at their lowest level relative to
use since 1974.
   The U.S. rice supply also has tightened, reflecting a 6 percent
reduction in last year's harvest.
   But the department's planting survey in early March indicated
American producers intend to boost 1988 rice plantings by 19
percent to 2.8 million acres. That could boost this year's output
sharply.
   ``U.S. farmers will harvest rice crops at least four months
ahead of their Asian competitors,'' the report said. ``Since the
United States will be the major source of supply during those
months, some increased export opportunities may exist towards the
end of 1988.''
   However, analysts cautioned that some foreign importers, if
possible, may ``choose to wait until the beginning of 1989, when
prices are likely to decline during the Asian harvest.''

   Former presidential spokesman Larry Speakes
has canceled plans to attend the White House Correspondents'
Association dinner here next week as a guest of The Washington
Post, an editor of the newspaper said Friday.
   Mary Hadad, the assistant managing editor in charge of the
Post's Style section, said Speakes was invited several weeks ago to
attend the dinner as a guest of the Style staff.
   This was before publication of a book in which Speakes admits
that he told reporters President Reagan had said things that the
president did not say.
   After the book appeared and controversy arose over Speakes'
assertions, Ms. Hadad said she and others at the Post sought to
reach Speakes to talk to him about the dinner and about
rescheduling a planned interview with him.
   She said the former spokesman talked by telephone Thursday night
with Style reporter Donnie Radcliffe.
   ``He called her last night and he withdrew,'' the editor said.
``They rescheduled their interview and I believe she expressed ...
how uncomfortable he might be'' at the dinner.
   The furor over Speakes' revelations also cost him his job Friday
as vice president for communications at Merrill Lynch Corp. in New
York. Speakes resigned, reportedly after intense pressure from
senior executives of the financial services firm.
   The president will speak at the dinner, scheduled for next
Thursday night at a Washington hotel.

   Michael Dukakis has expanded his delegate lead
to 112 over Jesse Jackson with the help of support from members of
Congress elected as delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
   Most of the 237 senators and representatives picked so far to
have votes at the convention have not announced their choices.
However, Dukakis was the early leader Friday in the battle for
support from congressional ``super delegates.''
   In Congress so far:
   _Twenty-six of the House Democrats nominated to be delegates are
backing the Massachusetts governor, while 15 are supporting
Jackson, according to a survey by The Associated Press. Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee has 12 in his corner and Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon, who has suspended active campaigning, has 10.
   _Nine of the 32 senators picked so far as delegates have
endorsed Dukakis. Gore has 5 senator-delegates and Simon 2,
including themselves. Jackson has none.
   Dukakis, whose campaign strategy is pegged on putting at least
250 delegates between himself and second-place Jackson in the next
few weeks, already has gained 100 toward that goal during the past
week.
   On Wednesday, he won the endorsement of Puerto Rico's governor,
who delivered himself and 51 other previously uncommitted delegates
as a bloc.
   For sheer size, the congressional caucuses rank behind only
California and New York in terms of the number of delegates being
sent to the convention. The two houses next week complete the
selection of 251 senators and representatives as delegates.
   In both houses, the delegate nominations are supervised by the
Democratic leadership, and next week's party caucuses are expected
to be little more than ceremonial. But the delegates' choices are
still generally unknown.
   Overall, Dukakis has 842.15 delegates, some 100 of whom are
``super delegates,'' the party leaders and politicians _ including
members of Congress _ who are being sent as delegates to the
convention because of offices they hold or held. In all, 644 of
these delegates, who are free to make or dissolve their commitments
to presidential candidates as they see fit, are to attend the
convention.
   Dukakis, Gore and Simon are super delegates, as is Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt, who dropped out of the presidental race last
month.
   The remaining 85 percent of the delegates to the convention,
3,518, are getting there through the primaries or caucuses, in
which they are required to pledge themselves to support a
presidential candidate or declare that they are uncommitted.
   Although, Dukakis' delegate lead is becoming formidable, his
total represents just 40 percent of the 2,082 delegates needed to
win the party's presidential nomination.
   Jackson, whose landslide victory in Michigan on March 26
momentarily pushed him into the lead in delegates, now has 730.1
delegates in the AP count. That includes 45 super delegates.
   Gore has 411.55 delegates, including 41 super delegates, and
Simon has 183.5 delegates overall, including 28.5 super delegates.
   More than 600 delegates are uncommitted, including about 400
from the ranks of the party's political professionals.

<HEAD>Lawyers Request Reopening Trial For Six Blacks On Death Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers on Friday filed an
application seeking to reopen the trial of six blacks who were
sentenced to hang in a case that drew worldwide protests.
   The court action came a day after six other blacks were hung at
Pretoria Central Prison, raising to 50 the number of executions in
South Africa this year.
   The application on behalf of the so-called Sharpeville Six was
filed in Pretoria Supreme Court. It is not known how soon a
decision on the request will be made.
   The five men and one women were convicted of complicity in the
mob killing of a black town councilor during anti-apartheid riots
that broke out in Sharpeville, south of Johannesburg, in September
1984. The violence touched off two years of nationwide unrest.
   The six were scheduled to die on March 18, but a stay of
execution was granted to allow time for defense lawyers to request
the case be reopened.
   The stay was decreed because of evidence that a state witness
committed perjury during the original trial.
   President P.W. Botha had previously rejected international
appeals to grant clemency to the six, saying he did not want to
interfere in the judicial process.
   The six were not accused of contributing physically to the death
of Sharpeville councilor Kuzwayo Dhlamini. They were convicted
under the doctrine of ``common purpose,'' which held them
responsible because they were part of the mob that killed the man.
   The government has argued that the Sharpville Six are being
falsely portrayed abroad as innocent victims of an unjust law.
Authorities say evidence in the trial showed that each played an
active part in the killing, through such alleged actions as making
firebombs to burn Dhlamini's house or slapping a woman who pleaded
for the councilor's life.
   The six men hung Thursday included two blacks in their 20s
described by authorities as ``comrades,'' a term commonly used to
describe anti-apartheid militants. They were convicted of killing
two other black men by setting fire to oil-soaked tires placed
around the victims' necks.
   One of the executed men was convicted of killing a mixed-race
man, while the other three were hung for murdering elderly whites.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Pentagon Asks Congressional Approval For $2 Billion Egypt Tank
Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon formally requested congressional
approval Friday for a $2 billion co-production deal that would
allow Egypt to build M-1A1 Abrams tanks.
   The arms transaction, disclosed several months ago by
administration officials, calls for the sale of 555 M-1A1 tanks. As
many as 540 of them could be built on a new assembly line to be
constructed in Egypt.
   Congress will now have 30 days to veto the deal should it wish
to do so.
   The Pentagon, in notifying Congress it had approved the
transaction, argued Egypt ``needs an advanced tank to ensure the
stability of the existing regional military balance, especially
vis-a-vis Libya.''
   ``The sale of this equipment and support will not adversely
affect the basic military balance in the region,'' the Pentagon
said.
   ``This sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national
security of the United States by helping to improve the security of
a friendly country which has been and continues to be an important
force for stability and peace in the Middle East.''
   The Pentagon said the U.S. Army would be responsible for
overseeing the transaction and that the prime contractor would be
the General Dynamics Land Services Corp. of Warren, Mich.

   The exhibition, titled ``The American Journalist,'' will be
co-sponsored by the American Society of Newspaper Editors and
financed by a $250,000 grant from the Gannett Foundation of
Rochester, N.Y. The show will tour several other cities after it

publisher and editor of the Southbridge (Mass.) News, who will be
guest curator of the show.
   Ghiglione is the new ASNE vice president and a fellow at the

   ``We see this exhibit as an instructive way to examine and
highlight the sometimes troubled relationship between journalists
and the institutions they cover, as well as their audiences,'' said
Eugene C. Dorsey, president of the Gannett Foundation.
   The Library of Congress, largest in the world, has 86 million

<HEAD>End of Season Ratings: Bad News and Confusion for Networks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS says it came in second in the television
ratings for the season according to the ratings company AGB,
although Nielsen results used by all three networks have CBS
finishing third for the first time ever.
   No matter whose figures are used, the end of season ratings
released by CBS Friday show that viewers are no longer enchanted by
its new shows and are turning instead to VCRs, cable and
independent stations, and perhaps even books, conversation or
exercise.
   CBS apparently suffered most. Except for ``Beauty and the
Beast,'' it could count no new shows as successes, even though
``Frank's Place,'' ``Wiseguy'' and ``Tour of Duty'' received
critical praise.
   ``We are not, as some people would expect, going to fall on our
swords in defeat,'' said David Poltrack, CBS vice president for
marketing, who briefed reporters on the end-of-season results. ``We
are not defeatists.''
   The networks' prime-time season doesn't officially end until
Sunday, but the last week's results aren't expected to change the
picture.
   ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard is to have a
session with reporters Monday, and NBC, which will win its third
season in a row, is holding an end-of-season briefing Tuesday.
   CBS held its briefing early perhaps because it is already
conceding it will come in third for the first time in the network's
history _ according to the A.C. Nielsen Co., the ratings service of
record since the 1950s.
   Last year, CBS signed up with Nielsen competitor AGB Media
Research, a British company. Although AGB numbers are not bought by
the other networks, nor are they used in the real business of
television ratings _ negotiating advertising rates _ CBS uses AGB
to back its contention that Nielsen's new people-meter audience
measurement system is inaccurate.
   Poltrack estimates that the networks will lose a combined $50
million in advertising revenues because of the lower numbers
produced by people meters.
   NBC and ABC agree that Nielsen's new system is not accurate
enough, but they haven't been hurt as much as CBS. In fact, ABC has
prospered.
   Poltrack wouldn't say how much of the $50 million loss was CBS'.
   According to Nielsen, the network averages after 29 weeks of the
30-week season were: NBC 16.1, ABC 13.7 and CBS 13.5. The rating is
a percentage of an estimated 88.6 million U.S. homes equipped with
television.
   CBS said AGB figures gave NBC 16.2, CBS 13.9 and ABC 13.2.
Poltrack conceded that CBS has little hope of getting advertisers
and the other networks to switch to AGB in lieu of Nielsen.
   Despite the ratings system squabble, a general erosion in
network audiences is uncontested, Poltrack said, although the
extent of it is unknown.
   According to Nielsen, the three-network average rating dropped 9
percent from 1986-87 to 1987-88. The previous year there was a 3
percent drop.
   Poltrack estimates that roughly half of the percentage drop is
real and half is a function of the people meter, a more complex
measurement device that requires particiants to actively punch in
and punch out when they watch television. The old system was a
hands-off attachment on the set.
   Historically, networks have lost audiences to increasing cable
availability, but this season the numbers show all cable channels
combined gaining only 1.2 percent in the ratings.
   The biggest drop in network audiences was in the realm of
theatrical movies, indicating increased use of cable or
videocassettes. However, audiences are also rejecting new network
programming.
   The highest-rated new show of the season was NBC's ``A Different
World,'' which, with an average rating of 25.1, is the only new
show to qualify as a bona fide hit. But it has never been tested
away from its timeslot that follows the No. 1-rated ``The Cosby
Show,'' of which it is a spinoff.
   Otherwise, new shows performed miserably. Of the 47 this season,
only eight exceeded the a 14.4 rating, the average for all network
prime-time programming.

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stepping over splintered glass and twisted
metal, Libyan officials led foreign visitors through Col. Moammar
Gadhafi's former home Friday to mark the second anniversary of the
U.S. bombing of Tripoli.
   The tour began at 2 a.m., the time that F-111 fighter bombers
attacked the Libyan capital and the coastal city of Benghazi on
April 15, 1986.
   President Reagan said he ordered the raid in retaliation for
alleged Libyan involvement in the bombing of a West German
nightclub which left two U.S. soldiers and a Turkish woman dead.
   Two bomb explosions in the last two days _ one near Madrid and
one in Naples, Italy, which killed a U.S. Navy woman _ may have
been linked to the anniversary.
   Libyan officials promised Gadhafi would appear early Friday at
the house, which was hit in the U.S. raid. But after an hour, the
visitors were escorted back from the fortified barracks compound on
the outskirts of the city to their hotel downtown.
   No explanation was given for Gadhafi's absence.
   Most of the 40-odd visitors were delegates to a three-day
conference on terrorism that ended Friday. The group included
people from Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Syria, Canada, Tunisia and
Spain. Journalists also were invited on the tour.
   Some of the convention delegates signed a green guest book in
the rubble-strewn entrance hall of the two-story tile-decorated
structure. The Libyans have turned the ruins into a memorial.
   The walls of Gadhafi's two master bedrooms are covered with
chalk graffiti, which guides said were the work of students
denouncing Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
U.S. bombers used in the raid took off from a British base.
   Gadhafi, addressing the convention delegates on Wednesday night,
spoke about the 1986 raid that Libyans said killed 37 people,
including his adopted baby daughter.
   ``Even if they were able to kill me on that day _ the day of the
U.S.-NATO barbarous aggression _ even if they were able to do that
in the future, that does not mean that they have succeeded in
accomplishing what they wanted,'' Gadhafi was quoted as saying in a
translation of his speech from Arabic by the official Libyan news
agency JANA.
   ``I am carrying the banner of peace in the Mediterranean and
would like peace for my country as much as for the other countries
of the world,'' JANA quoted him as telling the delegates.
   ``But at one time I thought of leaving this country to form an
internationalist secret army to effectively terrorize the
imperialists who savagely killed my children in Tripoli and
Benghazi.''
   Friday, the Moslem holy day, found Tripoli quiet. Two soldiers
with assault rifles guarded one of the entrances to Gadhafi's
compound, where he lives and works.
   In Italy, a man claiming to speak for the Organization of Jihad
Brigades claimed that the bombing of a U.S. military club Thursday
was in retaliation for the U.S. raid on Libya. The bombing in
Naples killed an American servicewoman and four Italian civilians.
   In Madrid, the national news agency EFE cited an unidentified
Defense Ministry source as saying a bombing at a U.S. Air Force
radio relay station east of the capital Friday could be linked to
the Tripoli anniversary. No injuries were reported.

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. has taken
out $100,000 in new loans from banks in his home state, plunging
his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination $1.6
million into debt.
   Gore was able to obtain the loans even though his prospects for
winning his party's nomination appear to be dimming.
   Polls indicate that his support in next Tuesday's New York
primary, and the contest a week later in Pennsylvania, is mired in
the single digits. He has not won an event since finishing first in
six of the 21 Super Tuesday contests on March 8.
   Gore has spent at least $700,000 on New York television
advertising. Of his two rivals, Jesse Jackson has purchased
$550,000 worth of ads and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
reportedly will spend as much as $1.5 million.
   Campaign officials said the most recent loans, for $50,000 each,
were from the Volunteer State Bank of Portland, Tenn., on April 11
and the Bank of Putnam County in Cookeville, Tenn., the following
day.
   Campaign manager Fred Martin said the campaign has no plans to
take out any more loans before the New York primary, but he would
not rule out additional loans after that.
   The campaign had acknowledged a $50,000 loan from Union Planters
Bank in Memphis, Tenn., on April 5.
   One problem Gore might face in repaying the loans is that the
federal matching funds he has been receiving may soon be dwindling.
   Federal assistance to campaigns is diminished if a candidate
fails to receive 10 percent of the vote in two successive primaries
_ which Gore has already done _ and then fails to achieve 20
percent support thereafter.

   In addition to its endorsement of Gore, the newspaper's lead

   Two Virginia men have begun a campaign
trying to draft Oliver North to run for the U.S. Senate.
   Jamey R. Wheeler and David L. Sobba of Arlington said they would
have a ``Draft North'' rally at the Iwo Jima Memorial next
Wednesday and have sent out letters urging a North candidacy for
the seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Paul Trible.
   Their letter, addressed to ``Dear Friend of Oliver North,''
accuses liberals of ``trying to put Ollie North in jail for
standing up for our freedom. That's why we need to show Col. North
that he has friends not only in the great Commonwealth of Virginia,
but all across America.''
   ``I think Oliver North would be the best and strongest candidate
with the right kind of charisma to beat someone like a Chuck
Robb,'' said Wheeler, referring to former Gov. Charles Robb, who is
seeking the Democratic nomination for the seat.
   But Alexandria GOP chief Jane Ring expressed skepticism about
the campaign. ``I don't think that's going to gather a lot of
steam,'' she said.
   Wheeler said he had not contacted North about the draft movement
and does not plan to. ``We're trying to help him make his
decision,'' he said.

   A dozen rockets went off Friday at a
smoldering ammunition dump that exploded five days earlier, the
Defense Ministry said. Five people were injured in the latest
blasts.
   High temperatures rekindled fires at the devastated ammunition
dump, detonating twelve rockets, the official Pakistan News Agency
quoted a Defense Ministry spokesman as saying.
   Five people were injured in surrounding areas, the news agency
said.
   The ammunition dump at Ojdri army camp is between the twin
cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
   The explosion on Sunday detonated rockets, missiles and other
weapons, killing at least 96 people, wounding more than 1,000
others and showering the cities with debris.
   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq has said that sabotage caused
Sunday's blast, but he has not said which group is responsible.
   The army has been blowing up unexploded projectiles outside
Islamabad.
   Authorities urged people to stay indoors after Friday's rocket
blasts.

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department's conservation
chief said Friday that more volunteers are needed to help carry out
a massive program aimed at protecting the nation's soil and water
resources.
   Last year some 2,200 volunteers provided more than $1 million
worth of assistance to agency field offices, said Wilson Scaling,
head of the Soil Conservation Service.
   This ``Earth Team,'' he said, put in more than 132,000 hours in
helping with tree planting, inventorying wetlands, conservation
education, telephoning land owners to inform them of the
Conservation Reserve Program and providing clerical and other
office help.
   Many of the volunteers have expertise in geology, biology,
botony, surveying, mapping, and soil and erodibility
determinations, Scaling said.
   Under the 1985 farm law, farmers with highly erodible cropland
must have a conservation plan approved by Dec. 31, 1989, and have
it implemented by Dec. 31, 1994, or loss USDA benefits such as
price support loans, payments and insurance.
   Scaling said the agency estimates that 800,000 conservation
plans still need to be developed nationwide.
   Anyone interested in volunteering for the Earth Team, he said,
can call 1-800-THE SOIL for the location of the local SCS office.
Volunteers receive coverage for injury claims, are compensated for
travel expenses, and have their contributions made part of a
permanent work record, Scaling said.

   A federal advisory panel issued updated

potential value of new classes of drugs but emphasizing the need to
prescribe the lowest effective dose of any medication.
   Intended primarily for physicians, the recommendations were
described by the chairman of the National Institutes of Health
panel as ``a sort of Bible or gospel of treatment.''
   Abram V. Chobanian, incoming dean of the Boston University
School of Medicine, added that the suggestions were based on an
eight-month review of latest research to update the guidelines last
issued four years ago.
   He noted that two new classes of drugs _ so-called calcium
antagonists and enzyme inhibitors _ have been approved for treating
high blood pressure since the last report.
   ``For many patients, they may cause fewer symptomatic and
biochemical side effects than diuretics and beta blockers,'' he
said, referring to the only high blood pressure drugs on the market
in 1984.
   But Chobanian emphasized that the updated guidelines call for
``lower initial doses for most drugs than we did in 1984.''
   ``The point here is that smaller doses mean fewer side
effects,'' he said at a news conference. ``This a critical
advantage because the side effects of traditional antihypertensive
drugs have been a major stumbling block to keeping patients on
their treatment.''
   Among other things, the widely used diuretics can cause
impotence and excessive loss of potassium in some patients.
   ``We recommend that some patients, especially those with mild
hypertension, start with nondrug treatments,'' said Chobanian. ``By
that I mean reducing weight, limiting sodium and alcohol, stopping
smoking, exercising and perhaps using biofeedback and relaxation
techniques.''
   The report urges physicians to carefully monitor those patients
who do need drug treatment with an eye to reducing the dosage or
perhaps eliminating such medication.
   The updated guidelines also say people with high blood pressure
should drink no more than the equivalent of two beers a day, down
from three in the 1984 report, and emphasizes that lowering blood
pressure alone is not a major reducer of heart attacks if the
patient does not also control other risk factors _ especially
smoking and high blood cholesterol levels.

<HEAD>Senate Bill Encourages Alternative Fuels Such as Coal, Gas, Grain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Friday passed legislation
designed to foster use of alternative motor fuels in order to
reduce U.S. dependency on foreign petroleum and tap vast U.S.
supplies of coal, natural gas and grain.
   The bill passed on a voice vote over warnings by Republicans on
the Environment Committee that it could lead to increased emissions
of the ``greenhouse'' gases that some scientists say are
overheating the Earth's atmosphere.
   The Senate action all but ensures that Congress will enact
alternative fuels legislation in 1988. A similar proposal was
passed overwhelmingly by the House earlier this year. The bills'
differences will have to be resolved by negotiators from both
chambers.
   Both proposals are geared toward encouraging the automobile
industry to mass-produce vehicles that can operate on fuels such as
methanol, ethanol and compressed natural gas.
   Methanol, which powers Indianapolis 500-type race cars at 200
miles an hour, can be manufactured from coal or natural gas.
Ethanol is made from grains like corn. The legislation has broad
support from coal and agricultural state lawmakers.
   The proposals would break an impasse that now prevents any
widespread switchover from gasoline to alternative fuels, according
to Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., a principal sponsor along with Sen.
Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
   ``Automakers are unwilling to produce (alternative fuel) cars
for which there is no current demand,'' Danforth said. ``Consumers
are unwilling to purchase cars for which there is no readily
available fuel supply, and service stations are unwilling to
provide fuel for cars that are not on the road.''
   Rockefeller said that besides lessening the growing U.S. need
for imported oil, a conversion of just 10 percent of the U.S.
vehicle fleet to coal-based methanol would mean jobs for 20,000
miners in the depressed coal industry.
   The sponsors said automakers would be encouraged to mass-produce
vehicles using alternative fuels because the legislation would make
it easier to meet the federal requirement that their fleets have an
average fuel economy of at least 26 miles per gallon.
   Under the bill's formula, a 25 mpg vehicle that uses a blend of
85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline would get a fuel
economy rating of 165 mpg, according to Danforth. A 25 mpg vehicle
using a 50-50 blend would be rated at 40 mpg, he said.
   The higher credits for alternative fuels would begin with the
vehicle 1993 model year.
   Danforth and Rockefeller's argument that methanol and ethanol
would cause fewer environmental and health problems than gasoline
was disputed by Environment Committee members Robert Stafford,
R-Vt., and John Chafee, R-R.I.
   Stafford said coal-derived methanol would double emissions of
carbon dioxide, a major contributor to the greenhouse effect, and
bring a tenfold increase in tailpipe emissions of formaldehyde, a
cancer-causing chemical.
   He urged the Senate to proceed cautiously because many
scientists warn that the production of greenhouse gases is
overloading the atmosphere, trapping heat around the Earth and
threatening major climate changes.
   ``Once we commit to a program like this, it will be too late,''
said Stafford, who unsuccessfully tried to add amendments to
require alternative vehicles to meet the same emissions standards
as gasoline vehicles.
   Chafee succeeded in adding language putting the Senate on record
as saying that coal-based methanol would boost carbon dioxide
levels, contribute to global overheating and should not be used
until emissions controls are developed to control carbon dioxide.

   Piedmont airlines maintenance crews
Friday began making temporary repairs to a crippled jetliner,
replacing an engine that exploded in midair and patching holes that
ripped through both sides of the cabin.
   The Fokker F-28 4000, a Dutch-made jet carrying 56 passengers
and a crew of four, was forced to land at Charleston on Thursday
after it lost cabin pressure and plunged partway toward the ground
as passengers screamed and fainted.
   After the workers replace the engine and cover the holes, the
plane is to be flown Saturday to a Piedmont maintenance facility at
Greensboro, N.C., for further study and repair, said Jeff Bubar,
manager of Yeager Airport.
   The engine mounted on the right side of the fuselage exploded
Thursday morning as the plane was at 31,000 feet en route from
Charlotte, N.C., to Columbus, Ohio. It was a half-hour out of
Columbus, and about 40 miles south of Charleston, when the
explosion occurred.
   A turbine blade and other engine parts cut through the plane's
right rear bathroom and a flight attendant work area. No one was
hit by the debris, but two flight attendants suffered bumps and
bruises as the plane plunged.
   The explosion was the first significant trouble reported with
the engines of a Fokker F-28, National Transportation Safety Board
statistics show. Rolls-Royce manufactured the engine that exploded
Thursday.
   Piedmont flies 25 Fokker F-28 4000s, which carry 72 people, and
20 Fokker F-28 1000s, which carry 62. They've used the Fokker
planes for about four years, but the model has been in use
elsewhere for about 20 years.
   The NTSB said it was too early to tell whether safety checks
will be required for the F-28s in Piedmont's fleet.
   ``The damage that took place is very apparent,'' said Dennis
Jones, who handled the NTSB's initial investigation of the
incident. ``What we have is engine failure ... and the side of the
airplane was breached.
   ``There was only limited work we could to there (in
Charleston),'' he said from his Washington, D.C., office. ``Our
work doesn't really begin until we can get the engine and the plane
elsewhere.''
   Jones said that despite the relatively safe history of the
Fokker model, the investigation would be needed to check whether
the problem could be found in other Fokker planes.
   ``Right now, were going to look at that particular aircraft and
that model of aircraft,'' Jones said. ``During the course of the
investigation, that will all be looked at, but we can't make that
determination now.
   ``We want to look at the problem it poses for the future. The
NTSB, in general, is set up to investigate accidents and prevent
similar occurrences.''
   The NTSB's Office of Safety Programs has only two injury
accidents involving Fokker F-28s in the U.S. since the early 1980s,
one when there was a minor collision on an airport taxiway and the
other when a person fell off the boarding stairs when a guardrail
gave way, said spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz.
   Piedmont spokesman Don McGuire contended that with such a
record, grounding the airline's other Fokkers would not be
necessary.
   ``We'll take a judicious approach to what the next step will
be,'' McGuire said.
   The airline, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., owns 25 Fokker F-28
4000 planes and 20 of the F-28 1,000 series.

<HEAD>Smothers Brothers Producer Lauds Exemption; 3-D `Moonlighting'
Scrapped</HEAD>

   The producer of the ``New Smothers Brothers
Comedy Hour'' said Friday that approval of an independent contract
with striking scriptwriters came in the nick of time for the show
and its stars.
   ``We made the point that it would be financially and,
careerwise, disastrous for Tom and Dick'' if the show ended,
producer Ken Kragen said in a telephone interview.
   The Writers Guild of America, whose members are concluding the
fifth week of their strike against producers and studios, voted
Thursday to reject independent contracts that would have allowed
work to resume at selected companies, with two exceptions: the
Smothers' show and Ivan Reitman Productions, which has produced
such movies as ``Ghostbusters'' and ``Animal House.''
   Guild leaders had recommended against allowing the separate
contracts because ``it could lead to divisiveness and destruction
of morale among members,'' said Cheryl Rhoden, a WGA spokeswoman.
She added, however, that the exceptions were granted because of
unspecified legal considerations and because negotiations with the
two producers ``were more advanced.''
   While the contract agreement with the 9,000-member union forbids
discussion of terms, Kragen said he believed the Smothers' support
of the strike on their show, as well as their reputation among
writers, won the day.
   ``There are a lot of writers who got their start in the business
with the Smothers, and went on to win Emmys. And now some of them
are on the Writers Guild board of directors,'' said Kragen.
   He also said the three union-written scripts for the show, which
ran out with Wednesday night's 8 p.m. broadcast on CBS-TV, were
kept untainted by non-union revisions.
   ``They laid out guidelines for us. We strained mightily, but we
stayed within those guidelines, and I think that impressed them,''
Kragen said.
   Also Friday, ABC-TV made official what ``Moonlighting'' producer
Glenn Caron announced four weeks ago: The much-publicized 3-D
version of the popular program for the May ratings sweeps period
has been scrubbed.
   ``After exhausting all of our options, we have concluded that to
go forward without an original script would not be in the best
interests of `Moonlighting,' our viewers or Coca-Cola,'' a promoter
of the episode, Ted Harbert, ABC's vice president for prime-time
entertainment, said in New York.
   Meanwhile, federal mediator Leonard Farrell scheduled a meeting
Monday morning between the WGA and representatives from The
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
   Writers on both coasts went on strike March 7. The walkout
shortened the season for some prime-time TV shows and stalled the
start of a few new series. There have been no formal negotiations
since mediated talks broke off March 10.
   Producers spokesman Herb Steinberg said he had little hope for
the Monday session, adding that alliance negotiators will attend
because the law requires them to. He declined comment on the
contract waiver deals.
   Disputed issues include how much writers are paid for foreign
broadcasts of their material and for reruns on domestic television.
How much creative input they have over their work is also an issue.

   The Soviet withdrawal agreement
brought no accord to Afghanistan on Friday: President Najib asked
the guerrillas to join a coalition government and they demanded he
be tried by a Moslem religious court.
   In Moscow, the official news agency Tass accused the United
States of trying to ruin the agreement by continuing to supply arms
to the Moslem insurgents. ``Washington is confirming its policy of
neoglobalism, a course of export of counter-revolution,'' it said.
   The guerrillas were not invited to the Geneva negotiations and
have said they will continue fighting.
   Najib, who uses only one name, also sent a message to President
Reagan thanking him for his efforts leading to the agreement signed
Thursday, under which the Red Army will begin May 15 to withdraw
the 115,000 soldiers in Afghanistan.
   In a statement broadcast by by Kabul radio, Najib invited the
guerrillas to accept his policy of national reconcilittion. ``We
are prepared to cooperate with those who are still fighting this
honorable policy,'' he said.
   ``We stress our willingness to meet the leaders of the
opposition in order to reach a decision on peace, for the happiness
of afflicted people ... for the future of the country's children.
We are waiting for the (naming) of your candidates for the National
Assembly and the Senate.''
   Elections for the Parliament ended Thursday. The guerrillas, who
have been fighting since a Communist coup in April 1978, were
offered seats but dismissed the election as a farce.
   Najib said 1.5 million people voted, showing their ``confidence,
needs and views.'' About 5 million Afghans _ one-third of the
population _ have left the country since Soviet soldiers arrived in
December 1979.
   ``Another step has been taken toward ending war and
brother-killing ... deepening political dialogue, the expansion of
democracy, the establishment of a coalition government with the
participation of all forces which represent the Afghan society,''
Najib declared.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, chairman of the seven-party guerrilla
alliance based in Peshawar, a border city in Pakistan, said Najib
and all members of the ruling Communist Party must be tried in
absentia by religious courts.
   He said Soviet soldiers held by the guerrillas would be
exchanged for Afghan army soldiers, and ``all those POWs will be
kept until the Najib regime is toppled and is replaced by an
Islamic government so all those criminals who flee with the Red
Army could be brought back ... for trial'' in exchange for the
prisoners.
   ``In my view, all members of the Central Committee ... including
Najib the puppet must be tried in absentia ... so that after the
withdrawal of the Russian forces such criminals be dealt with in
accordance with Islamic laws, and those who have been misled and
played off against their nation by these criminals be pardoned,''
Hekmatyar said.
   The insurgents have said they will not share power with
Communists in a future government, but had not called for trials.
They have predicted that Najib would follow the Soviet soldiers to
Moscow.
   Guerrilla leaders have not said how many Soviet prisoners they
have, but last month Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami party said an
agreement had been reached to exchange a Soviet soldier for 25
guerrilla prisoners. The exchange has not occurred.

   Larry Speakes, the former Mississippi weekly
newspaper editor who rose to be a presidential spokesman and Wall
Street executive, often boasted that he never lied to the press
during his years at the White House.
   But in his new book, Speakes admitted that he fabricated quotes
and attributed them to President Reagan. He resigned Friday as vice
president for communications of Merrill Lynch and Co., saying it
was ``the best course of action'' in the wake of that admission.
   At the White House, Speakes' successor, Marlin Fitzwater, would
say only, ``I'm sorry for him, personally.'' Earlier, he had called
Speakes' practice an outrage, said it reflected on the integrity of
the White House press office. He promised that he would never do
anything similar.
   Speakes, 48, became the chief White House spokesman after
Reagan's press secretary, James Brady, was wounded during an
assassination attempt on the president on March 30, 1981. Brady has
continued to hold the title of press secretary although he has been
unable to return to his duties.
   Fitzwater, who served two years as a deputy to Speakes and then
became press secretary to Vice President George Bush, has been the
chief White House spokesman since Speakes left the post 14 months
ago.
   Speakes grew up in Merigold, Miss., which he describes in his
book, ``Speaking Out,'' as ``Middle America, the heartland, Norman
Rockwell's America.''
   The words are similar to those Reagan has often used in speaking
of his own home town, Dixon, Ill.
   In fact, Speakes said that when he told Reagan of his decision
to leave the White House and accept the offer from Merrill Lynch,
he told him, ``As a kid growing up in a town in Mississippi of 700,
I never expected to meet a president, much less work with one.''
   He said Reagan replied, ``Well, what do you think of a kid
growing up in a small town in Illinois?''
   Speakes attended the University of Mississipi for four years,
but did not receive a degree because he had not completed his
second year of French. While in summer school trying to complete
the work, he accepted an offer to be editor of the Oxford, Miss.,
Eagle, a weekly with a circulation of about 4,000.
   For a young married man whose wife was expecting their first
child, the salary of $85 a week was too good in 1961 to turn down.
Later he held editorial posts at other Mississippi weeklies and
became co-owner of four such newspapers.
   In 1968, he came to Washington as press secretary to
Mississippi's Democratic Sen. James O. Eastland. He was an honorary
pallbearer at Eastland's funeral in 1986 and said in his book,
``Not a day goes by even now that I don't remember him and tell
another Eastland story.''
   Speakes first entered the White House in 1974 as an assistant to
President Nixon's press secretary, Ron Ziegler. Nixon resigned a
few months later and Speakes stayed on to serve as an assistant in
President Ford's press office.
   In the 1976 election, he was press secretary to Ford's running
mate, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas. After Ford lost to Jimmy Carter,
Speakes went to work for the public relations firm of Hill &
Knowlton in Washington.
   Saying that he found the public relations business ``neither as
interesting nor as much fun as I had expected it to be,'' he went
to work for the Reagan campaign in 1980 and then returned to the
White House as a deputy press secretary.
   After he took over the chief spokesman's job, his relations with
the White House press corps were often contentious, with Speakes
accusing reporters of being out to get the president, and the
reporters accusing Speakes of not being candid.
   Speakes often said his credibility was his most precious
possession and he would not risk losing it by lying to the press.
   In his book, however, he says that at Reagan's 1985 summit
meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva he had an aide ``draft
some quotes for the president,'' polished them and then told
reporters that they were what the president said to the Soviet
leader.
   ``In restrospect, it was clearly wrong to take such liberties,''
he said in his book. But, he added, ``I had been able to spruce up
the president's image by taking a bit of liberty with my P.R. man's
license.''

   Snow fell Friday around the Great Lakes and over parts of New
England, while unseasonably chilly air settled over the desert
Southwest and heavy rain fell in Nevada and from the Plains into
the mid-Mississippi Valley.
   Snow fell across much of Michigan, northern Ohio and western New
York during the afternoon but little accumulated as temperatures
were above freezing. Snow reduced visibility to a quarter-mile at
Youngstown, Ohio.
   Higher elevations of Vermont got 1 to 2 inches of snow in the
morning.
   A winter storm watch was posted overnight for all of Vermont and
parts of northeastern New York state, with up to 6 inches of snow
possible.
   In the Southwest, the temperature at Yuma, Ariz., normally one
of the hottest cities in the nation, was just 56 degrees at noon
with rain. The normal high temperature at Yuma at this time of the
year is 86 degrees. Needles, Calif., at the same time was just 53
degrees.
   More than an inch of rain fell on parts of southern Nevada
during the night and more locally heavy rainfall was possible.
   Rain persisted from northeastern Oklahoma across the Ozarks of
southern Missouri and northern Arkansas to Tennessee. Temperatures
were chilly with an afternoon reading of 44 at Nashville, Tenn.
Rain at Paducah, Ky., mixed with sleet in the morning.
   Elsewhere, a few thunderstorms developed during the morning in
Texas in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and into southeastern Oklahoma.
   An overnight frost and freeze advisory was issued for northern
and central sections of Illinois and a frost advisory was issued in
parts of Indiana.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 31
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 87 at Fort Stewart and Hinesville,
Ga. The nation's morning low was 17 degrees at Bismarck, N.D.
   For Saturday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from Texas across the southern Rockies and Arizona to southern
Idaho. Rain and snow showers were forecast from New England to the
middle Atlantic states and the West Virginia mountains.
   Highs in the 40s or 50s were predicted from the northern and
middle Atlantic Coast states across the upper Ohio Valley to the
Great Lakes region, and in the mountains of northern Arizona; in
the 80s from Florida across the Gulf Coast region to southern
Texas, and in the 60s or 70s across most of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Town's Second Elected Mayor, Like Its First, Indicted</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS lead to CORRECT that town is Fort Lauderdale suburb,

<DATELINE>SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Fort Lauderdale suburb is 2-for-2 when
it comes to electing mayors.
   The first elected mayor was indicted four times before he was
convicted of fraud and extortion conspiracy. The second and current
elected mayor, Larry Hoffman, turned himself in Friday, the day
after he was indicted on theft charges by a Broward County grand
jury.
   He was booked at the county jail and released on a $2,000 bond,
said Dave Casey, a spokesman for the state attorney's office. An
arraignment date was not set.
   The grand theft count, a felony punishable by up to five years
in prison and a $5,000 fine, charges that Hoffman last year
illegally obtained a city-owned chain saw worth at least $300,
Casey said.
   The petty theft charge accuses Hoffman of ordering workers at
the city garage to repair a riding lawn mower owned by his
daughter, said Casey. The petty theft charge is a misdemeanor
punishable by up to a year in jail. The alleged incident took place
between August 1986 and February 1987.
   Asked on his way into the jail if was confident he'd be
vindicated, Hoffman's only reply was, ``Very.''
   Hoffman, 62, a retired New York police officer and self-emloyed
insurnce appraiser, was elected to the non-partisan post in this
town of 40,000 in September 1985.
   Hoffman has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing since the
allegations became public early this year. He voluntarily testified
before the grand jury for nearly three hours Wednesday.
   Former city garage employee Chris Green, who maintains he
resigned from his job because he was harassed for tattling on the
mayor, said after the indictment was issued that ``justice has been
done. We've been telling the truth from the beginning.''
   Hoffman, the second elected mayor in Sunrise's 21-year history,
also is the second elected mayor to be indicted while in office.
   Former Mayor John Lomelo was indicted four times during his
18-year term.
   In the first three cases, he was acquitted or cleared by a
judge. But in 1985, he was convicted by a federal jury of extortion
conspiracy for forcing a developer to pay a friend $30,000 in
exchange for his support on a nursing home project. He was also
convicted in a $52,000 mail fraud scheme.
   Lomelo was released from prison last year.
   Jon Peck, Gov. Bob Martinez's press secretary, said the governor
had not received official word of the indictment and had not acted
to suspend Hoffman from office. Such suspensions are required when
a mayor is indicted on a felony count.
   ``The governor can't suspend unless and until we have
paperwork,'' Peck said. ``Clearly, if there is an indictment and he
is suspended, the governor will move quickly to fill the vacancy.''

   Federal investigators said Friday they have
broken up a Chinese heroin-trafficking ring, arresting 11 people in
Hong Kong and nine in the United States while seizing 137 pounds of
heroin worth over $100 million.
   Five of those arrested in New York were charged with conspiring
to supply 1,000 M-16 military rifles to undercover federal agents
and to provide false documents so the rifles could be shipped to
Libya.
   The breakup of the Asian ring was the culmination of a two-year
investigation called Operation Bamboo Dragon that was launched when
federal agents learned that a restaurant owner in the Chinatown
section of Washington was buying stolen firearms and distributing
cocaine.
   The FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Customs Service conducted
the investigation and law enforcement officials announced the
arrests at a news conference in Washington.
   Drug-importing Asian criminal gangs ``are moving in to fill the
void'' left by the successful prosecution of Sicilian Mafia members
in the United States, FBI Director William Sessions said in a
statement.
   ``This gang was capable of putting enormous firepower into the
hands of terrorists and drug smugglers,'' Customs commissioner
William von Raab said in a statement. Federal officials said the
ring had supplied 600 handguns, mostly to Chinese gangs.
   The FBI and ATF inserted undercover operatives into the ring,
including a Chinese-speaking agent who portrayed himself as a drug
dealer.
   The Cantonese-speaking federal agent, Frederick Yau, met with
gang members in Washington and Hong Kong to negotiate the purchase
of heroin from Asia.
   The heroin came from Burma and China and was transported to San
Francisco and New York City's Chinatown. It also was distributed to
Newark, N.J., Alexandria, Va., and Washington.
   U.S. members of the ring were selling hundreds of stolen or
illegally obtained hand- and machine guns and rifles on the streets
of New York City, usually to Chinese gangs.
   Many of the firearms were obtained with fraudulent
identification documents from gun shops in Fort Worth, Dallas and
Houston, Texas, the officials said.
   The Chinese gangs were buying AR-15 semi-automatic rifles _ the
civilian version of the Army's M-16 rifle _ and converting them
into fully automatic M-16s.
   Customs and ATF undercover agents bought 10 weapons from the
five people charged in New York City and ordered 1,000 more M-16s
that were to be delivered to Libya. Such shipments would have
violated the Arms Export Control Act, which sets up federal
licensing procedures for the sale of weapons to foreign countries.

   The town of Ogunquit will appeal a $300,000
jury award to a Canadian woman who sued for injuries suffered when
she was knocked down by a teen-ager trying to catch a Frisbee on a
beach, an attorney said.
   Josee Noel, 50, of Mount St. Hilaire, Quebec, was struck from
behind by the teen-ager as she walked along the beach while on
vacation in July 1982.
   She said that she was knocked to the ground and broke her leg
but that complications during recovery kept her in a wheelchair for
three years.
   A Superior Court jury awarded Mrs. Noel $331,475 on Wednesday,
but Justice Paul A. Fritzsche reduced that to $300,000, the legal
limit on damages against a municipality.
   The incident occurred in an area where game-playing was banned.
Witnesses testified during the three-day trial that lifeguards did
not enforce the rule, although it was their job to do so.
   ``It was our contention that if a regulation is good enough to
have, it's good enough to enforce,'' said Mrs. Noel's attorney,
Robert H. Stier Jr.
   Ogunquit will appeal the verdict to the Maine Supreme Court,
said town attorney Jeffrey T. Edwards.

<HEAD>Pro-Stalin Letter A Mistake, Soviet Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet newspaper said Friday that it made a
mistake by printing a letter that criticized Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms and defended Josef V. Stalin.
   The letter from a Leningrad teacher, published March 13, said
Stalin's accomplishments were being ignored and his crimes
overemphasized. It criticized Gorbachev's ``perestroika'' program
of restructuring Soviet society.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya, the organ of the Russian republic's
Communist Party and government, said in an editor's note Friday
that it used poor judgement in printing the letter.
   The editors said they had ``not demonstrated enough
responsiblity, a sufficiently balanced approach and the
understanding that (the letter) leads one away from the
revolutionary renewal of society through democracy and glasnost.''
   Glasnost is Gorbachev's policy of greater openness in selected
topics.
   The editor's note was accompanied by 10 readers' letters
condemning the teacher's comments.
   Some observers believe the offending letter indicated the
newspaper fell under the influence of conservatives led by Yegor K.
Ligachev, considered the second most powerful official in the
Kremlin after Gorbachev.
   Ligachev, a member of the ruling Politburo, has suggested that
glasnost has gone too far in uncovering past Soviet mistakes.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, said in an editorial April 5
that Sovietskaya Rossiya's editors had been irresponsible in
publishing the teacher's letter and warned that the Soviet press is
``not a private shop'' where opponents of party decisions can voice
their opinions.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya reprinted the Pravda article without comment
on April 6. Gorbachev praised Pravda for setting the record
straight.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya discussed the letter again in Friday's
editions, on a page bearing the headline ``The Party is Going to
the Lead of Perestroika.'' It said it had been swamped with letters
about the dispute and claimed all supported Gorbachev's reform
program.
   However, the editors said they would not shy away from
controversial articles.
   ``Direct, frank talking to readers has been, is and will remain
the main genre of our party newspaper,'' they wrote.
   In an accompanying article, historian L. Ryansky defended the
media's uncovering of Stalin's crimes and rehabilitation of his
victims. He said the writing proved that ``the truth, no matter how
concealed, sooner or later will triumph.''

<HEAD>Judge Warns Against Unauthorized Disclosure of Classified
Documents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra trial warned
Friday against the unauthorized disclosure of some 300,000
classified documents expected to be turned over to the defense by
prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh.
   In an order detailing procedures for handling the documents by
the defense, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell warned that
``unauthorized disclosure of classified information may constitute
violations of United States criminal laws.''
   ``Persons subject to this order are advised that direct or
indirect unauthorized disclosure, retention or negligent handling
of classified documents or information could cause serious damage,
and in some cases exceptionally grave damage, to the national
security of the United States or may be used to the advantage of a
foreign nation against the interests of the United States,'' the
judge said.
   The nine-page order requires that the defendants, their lawyers
and any witnesses must obtain approval of the court-designated
security officer before gaining access to classified documents.
   Access will be granted on a ``need-to-know'' basis and the
defendants, their lawyers and witnesses must sign an agreement not
to make unauthorized disclosures of the information contained in
the documents, Gesell said.
   ``Any violation of the terms of this order shall be immediately
brought to the attention of the court and may result in a charge of
contempt of court and possible reference for criminal
prosecution,'' Gesell said.
   Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter are accused of conspiring with arms
dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord to divert profits illegally from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   At a hearing Tuesday, independent counsel Walsh said that as
many as 300,000 classified documents are being reviewed by an
interagency government task force. Walsh said he expected that
50,000 documents relevant to the case will be ready for defense
review by month's end.
   Gesell ordered that the defense is entitled to review the rest
of the material to determine if it is relevant to their case when
the matter goes to trial.
   The order requires that lawyers can only work with the documents
or discuss them with each other or witnesses in the special
security facility that is being constructed by the court security
officer.
   Gesell prescribed a type of word processing equipment, which is
apparently resistant to electronic eavesdropping, to be used by the
defense for preparing court pleadings based on the materials.
   All pleadings dealing with classified information must be
prepared in the facility and filed under seal with the court
security officer, who will delete classified references before the
briefs are placed in the public file, Gesell ordered.
   Before any classified document is introduced into evidence at
the trial, it must be declassified by the government agencies that
produced it.
   If the government refuses to declassify a document, the
Classified Information Procedures Act empowers the court to
substitute a statement of facts that the material would prove.
   The court could also agreed to delete certain classified
markings that reveal intelligence methods but were not pertinent to
the case.
   Gesell gave the defense until April 29 to file a challenge to
the application fo the classified information statute to the case.
The defense complained that the law requires procedures that
inhibit their ability to prepare their case.

   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis won praise but no endorsement Friday from New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, who said all the contenders were ``singularly
important'' Democrats.
   Cuomo said at a state Capitol news conference that Dukakis, the
front-runner in polls preceding Tuesday's New York primary, was ``a
singularly important Democratic leader.''
   Two days earlier, the governor had told Jackson he was
``singularly important Democrat.''
   Questioned by reporters, Cuomo said all the Democratic
candidates, including Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., were
``singularly important'' no matter where they finish.
   Recent polls show Dukakis leading Jackson with Gore far behind
in the battle for the 255 delegates at stake in the primary, the
biggest delegate prize of the campaign season so far.
   Cuomo hasn't met with Gore since March 21 and is not scheduled
to.
   On Friday, the governor scrapped plans to make campaign stops
with all three candidates in the New York City area over the next
few days. His aides cited the press of state business.
   Earlier Friday, Dukakis spoke with students at a junior high
school in Brooklyn, warning against using illegal drugs and
engaging in an exchange with students on how widespread the problem
is.
   He met privately with some students and said they told him 25
percent to 50 percent of school-age kids were using drugs.
   Then, he walked around the crowded school auditorium, asking
students how many of their peers used drugs regularly.
   ``Crack can kill you, right? Who was killed by crack _ Lenny
Bias, right? ... In about four minutes, that young man's life was
snuffed out,'' he said, referring to the former University of
Maryland basketball star.
   At one point, he asked students what should be done to students
who use drugs. ``Should we suspend them?'' he asked, eliciting a
chorus of ``no'' from the students. ``Why not _ they're breaking
the law, aren't they?'' he said.
   Later, at a rally in Albany after his appearance with Cuomo,
Dukakis criticized the Reagan administration for not doing more in
the fight against illegal drugs.
   ``Why do we have money for Star Wars and not money for a war
against drugs?'' he asked. ``The greatest threat in this hemisphere
is not the Sandinistas, it's the avalanche of drugs.''
   Cuomo, during his news conference with Dukakis, said all three
candidates had grown during the campaign, but he declared ``that is
particularly true of Governor Dukakis.''
   ``If Governor Dukakis becomes the candidate of the Democratic
Party, he will be a superb representative of the Democrats,'' he
said. ``I believe he will be a winner in November and I believe he
would go on to be a great president.''
   During their news conference, Dukakis was asked if he had ``any
fear that when you get to the convention, you may be facing him
(Cuomo) as a competitor?''
   ``Should I have?'' joked Dukakis to Cuomo. The New York governor
said, ``No.''
   While Cuomo declared more than a year ago that he wouldn't seek
the Democratic presidential nomination, it was only in the past few
days that he has indicated he wouldn't accept a draft at a
deadlocked convention.
   When the questioning turned to whether the Massachusetts
governor would want Cuomo to serve in a Dukakis administration,
Dukakis said it was ``not the time to be thinking about who should
be in your administration.''
   ``Can we fix a time?'' asked Cuomo.
   ``But his mother always wanted him to serve on the Supreme
Court,'' said Dukakis.

   A bomb exploded in front of a
crowded movie theater in downtown Pretoria on Friday night, killing
a man and injuring a woman, police said.
   Police spokesman Eddie Everson said the blast occurred about
7:30 p.m. (1:30 p.m. EDT) on the street in front of the Sterland
Cinema complex. A second explosion happened about 15 minutes later
at a shop several blocks away.
   Everson said a man was killed in the theater blast, and police
are investigating whether he may have been the person who planted
the bomb. He said a woman was slightly wounded.
   He had said earlier that there were ``numerous'' injuries, but
amended his report.
   The spokesman said the dead man's body was ``very badly
mutilated,'' and a car in the street was destroyed. But he said
there was no damage to the eight-cinema complex, which attracts
hundreds of people on Friday nights.
   ``The possibility that the man killed was the person who placed
the bomb is being investigated,'' Everson said. ``At this stage
this has not been determined whether this is the case or not.''
   Police immediately evacuated the movie theaters and cordoned off
surrounding streets.
   The second blast occurred on a street where all the shops were
closed for the evening. Some windows were broken but there were no
injuries, Everson said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the explosions.
   On Thursday night, a bomb damaged the facade of the City Hall
building in downtown Johannesburg, but caused no injuries. No one
has claimed responsibility for the bombing.
   However, police have blamed virtually all bombings in recent
years on the African National Congress guerrilla group.
   The outlawed ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, wages a bombing and
sabotage campaign in a bid to overthrow the white-led government.
The ANC rarely confirms or denies involvement in bombings in South
Africa.
   There have been more than 60 bombings in South Africa since the
government declared a state of emergency in June 1986. Three
blacks, including a policemen, were killing March 17 in a car
bombing in Krugersdorp, about 20 miles west of Johannesburg.

<TEXT>
   Voters in northwest Louisiana decide Saturday
whether to send a Republican with a Democratic past or a four-term
Democratic state senator to Congress to serve out Gov. Buddy
Roemer's unexpired term.
   Republican Jim McCrery, a 38-year-old lobbyist for
Georgia-Pacific Corp. and a former aide to Roemer, led Foster
Campbell in this week's polls by 4 to 5 percentage points in the
race for the 4th Congressional District seat.
   If elected, McCrery, who switched from the Democratic Party to
the GOP in October, would be the first Republican from the district
since Reconstruction.
   Roemer, a Democrat, vacated the seat March 14, the day he was
inaugurated governor. The winner of Saturday's race will have to
run for re-election again in the fall. Roemer has made no
endorsement.
   Campbell, 41, of Elm Grove, lost an eye and broke several facial
bones March 13 when he drove his car off an unfinished, closed
portion of Interstate 49.
   The campaign has been a lively one, beginning with a field of 10
candidates, McCrery as the only GOP candidate.
   In the March 8 primary, McCrery led with 31 percent of the vote
followed by Campbell with 19 percent. The runoff election Saturday
was made necessary because no one had a majority.

   Child care is ``a new urgency for America's
working parents'' and increasingly an issue that employers must
face, a Labor Department report said Friday.
   Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin said the issue was ``a national
concern.''
   ``Let's start with a key fact: over half of the country's women
with pre-school or school-age children work,'' she said at a news
conference, noting that each group of children from infants to
latch-key children required a different programmatic response.
   The department's 12-member Task Force on Child Care, composed of
senior Labor Department officials, has reviewed proposed
legislation, major articles, surveys and studies on the issue to
determine the severity of the problem.
   The panel's report found the child care issue to be ``a matter
of new urgency for America's working parents, one that by simple
arithmetic is of considerable magnitude.''
   The task force said that there was ``widespread (public) concern
that a crisis exists ... in the ability of America's parents'' to
find child care, but the panel stopped short of describing the
problem as a crisis.
   ``We don't see it as a national ... crisis but we see it as a
terrific national concern,'' McLaughlin said.
   The report, entitled ``Child Care: A Workforce Issue,'' said the
federal government is already addressing the child care issue with
more than $6.9 billion spent on Head Start and other child care
programs. It said state and local governments have shown commitment
to funding for child care, training providers, referral systems and
defining standards for providers.
   But although many employers have realized the economic benefits
of responding to employee child care needs, others have yet to
grasp the impact of inadequate child care on worker performance and
absenteeism, the report said.
   McLaughlin said the Labor Department would conduct a
comprehensive review of all departmental laws and regulations to
evaluate their impact on work and family; recognize employers and
unions who develop new approaches to child care and publish and
promote examples; provide technical assistance and information to
labor and management, and increase the availability of child care
options in the Job Corps and the Job Training Partnership Act.
   McLaughlin said department's day care center would be expanded
as an employer model, as would the availability of assistance to
department employees.

<HEAD>U.S. Vetoes Resolution Opposing Israeli Deportations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   America on Friday vetoed a Security
Council resolution that urged Israel to stop deporting Palestinians
from the occupied territories, saying the measure lacked balance.
   Arab diplomats denounced the action and said it hurt the latest
U.S. initiative to promote Middle East peace talks.
   Fourteen of the council's 15 members voted for the resolution
and Britain made an unusually harsh speech against Israel's policy
of deporting Palestinians allegedly linked to disturbances in the
occupied West Bank of the Jordan River and Gaza Strip.
   British Ambassador John Birch called the deportations ``brutal
and often indiscriminate actions'' and said they are ``immoral,
illegal and politically self-defeating.''
   ``World opinion has been shocked and disgusted _ rightly so _ by
the widespread suffering of the civilian population of all ages and
both sexes'' in the territories, he said.
   Arab League spokesman Clovis Maksoud said the veto ``mortally
wounded'' the U.S. peace initiative and would encourage Israel to
mistreat the 1.5 million Palestinians living under Israeli
occupation.
   ``The veto today ratifies that level of permissiveness that has
emboldened Israel to defy the international community,'' Maksoud
told a news conference after the council meeting.
   Zehdi L. Terzi, envoy of the Palestine Liberation Organization
that has observer status at the United Nations, told the council
the United States had isolated itself by killing the resolution.
``There's always a rotten apple in the box,'' he said.
   In casting the veto, U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun said the
resolution's ``broad and sweeping condemnation of Israel contains
not a scintilla of balance. It contains no appeal or request for
calm.''
   The measure urged Israel to halt deportations, condemned human
rights violations in the occupied territories and called for a
U.N.-sponsored settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Israel deported eight Palestinian civilians earlier this week
and issued deportation orders for 12 others as part of its effort
to quell four months of violence in the West Bank and Gaza that has
claimed more than 140 Arab lives. Two Israelis have died.
   Okun told the council the United States is engaged in a major
diplomatic effort to bring about direct negotiations between Israel
and its Arab neighbors.
   The Soviet Union and most Arab nations want a peace conference
under U.N. auspices that would include the PLO and the five
permanent members of the Security Council: the United States,
Soviet Union, China, Britain and France. Permanent members have
veto power.
   Other members of the council are Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Italy, Japan, Nepal, Senegal, West Germany, Yugoslavia and Zambia.
   Israel refuses to talk with the PLO, which it considers a
terrorist organization, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has
opposed an international peace conference, saying it might try to
force concessions that would jeopardize Israel's security.
   Despite its veto, the United States has been critical of
Israel's handling of violence in the occupied territories.
   On Jan. 5, it cast a rare vote against Israeli, joining the rest
of the Security Council in approving a resolution urging the Jewish
state to refrain from an earlier round of deportations.
   Israel defied the resolution and deported four Palestinian
activists to Lebanon.
   The United States on Jan. 14 declined to use its veto to protect
Israel and abstained as the council passed a resolution urging
Israel to let the deportees return.
   Okun said Friday the latest resolution was redundant.

   The former police chief of Marlow was
charged Friday with second-degree murder, a month after authorities
dug up the remains of his wife's first husband in his yard after
his father made a deathbed confession.
   Robert Chambers, 36, appeared relaxed but said nothing as he
surrendered at the state police station in Keene and sat through
two court appearances in the 1978 killing of Russell Bean, a close
friend. Unable to post the $200,000 bail, he was taken to the
Cheshire County Jail.
   Chambers was not handcuffed during his arraignment in Keene
District Court and bail hearing in superior court. He entered no
plea, but his attorney, Mark Sisti, said his client will plead
innocent to the charge, which he called a mistake.
   Bean was 25 when was last seen in 1978. His wife, Sylvia, moved
in with Chambers and married him soon after her husband
disappeared. After Bean's remains were found last month, she and
Chambers separated.
   Chambers' sister, Melissa, came forward March 10, the day after
her father died. She said in affidavits that Clifton Chambers, 61,
told her that his son came to him 10 years ago and said he
accidentally killed Bean in a fight, and that the father helped his
son bury the body with a backhoe.
   Authorities dug for three days in a spot that once was a pig pen
before finding Bean's remains 25 feet down. Chambers resigned as
the town's part-time chief.
   He also took a leave of absence from his job as part-time chief
of nearby Gilsum and was suspended without pay as a trainee with
the Winchester police department.
   Attorney General Stephen Merrill announced the arrest at a news
conference in Concord. He said Chambers was not charged with
first-degree murder because there was no evidence of premeditation.
   Merrill said further charges related to concealment of a corpse
may be filed, but that he anticipates no other arrests.
   If convicted, Chambers could be sentenced to 30 years in prison
without parole, Merrill said.
   While Chambers is held at the county jail he would be separated
from other inmates to protect him from prisoners he might have
arrested as a police officer, said the attorney general.
   Merrill said he expects the defense to challenge the elder
Chambers' ``dying declaration'' as inadmissible hearsay and
anticipates having the issue settled by the state Supreme Court.
New Hampshire law allows so-called dying declarations to be
admitted as evidence in certain cases.
   Although acknowledging that without the dying declaration Bean's
body may never have been found, Merrill said investigators have
enough evidence after interviewing 15 to 20 people to convict
Chambers even if his father's declaration is not allowed in court.
   An autopsy showed Bean had been beaten with a blunt instrument.
Merrill declined to say whether a weapon had been recovered, what
physical evidence there was or whether there had been witnesses.
   Maj. Donal Anderson, who headed the investigation, said Bean's
disappearance had not been treated as a crime in 1978. He said his
investigation showed that Bean and Chambers ``had an altercation,
which indicates there was bad blood.''

<TEXT>
   An explosive device blew up early Friday at
a U.S. Air Force radio-relay station causing slight damage and no
injuries, U.S. Embassy spokesman Bob Meade reported.
   He said the bomb had been placed near an air conditioning unit
at the Humosa relay station six miles east of the U.S.-Spanish air
base at Torrejon. The air base is 12 miles northeast of Madrid.
   The Spanish news agency EFE quoted an unidentified Defense
Ministry source as saying the bombing could be related to the
second anniversary of the April 15, 1986, U.S. air raids on Libya.
   The explosion occurred a day after a car bomb blew up in front
of a USO club in Naples, Italy, killing five people, including a
U.S. Navy servicewoman. Italian police said they believed a member
of the Japanese Red Army was responsible.
   A group calling itself the Organization of Jihad Brigades
claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was in revenge
for the U.S. bombing of Libya.
   Meade said no group or individual asserted responsibility for
the attack near Madrid. He said the blast damaged a maintenance
building but did not interrupt Air Force communications at Torrejon.
   There have been many demonstrations in recent years at Torrejon
protesting U.S. military bases in Spain and Spain's membership in
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   In January, the United States agreed to withdraw within three
years a tactical wing of 72 F-16 fighter bombers from Torrejon.
That was part of a new eight-year pact on American military units
in Spain that will replace a five-year accord which expires May 14.
   The U.S. armed services maintain three air bases and a naval
station in Spain that involve some 10,000 military personnel.
   President Reagan ordered the air raids on Libya in retaliation
for alleged Libyan links to the bombing of a nightclub in West
Berlin that killed two U.S. servicemen and a Turkish woman.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Hear Charges Of `Male-Bashing' In University Women's
Studies Class</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WHITE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A University of Washington business
student whose dismissal and subsequent reinstatement in a women's
studies class has sparked a controversy says he was intimidated by
what he called ``male-bashing'' in the course.
   ``I felt about as welcome in the class as a black at a Klan
meeting,'' Peter Schaub told a meeting of the state Senate Law and
Justice Committee on Friday.
   Schaub became the focus of a controversy after a dean, James
Nason, banned him from an introductory women studies course during
the winter quarter for alleged disruptive and threatening behavior.
   The dean later reinstated him, and Schaub was given credit for
the course although he had missed nearly half of the classes. The
class is ungraded; one either passes or fails.
   The controversy has sparked several emotional campus
demonstrations, and Schaub has even been approached by television
producers seeking rights to his story.
   Class instructors and some students had charged that Schaub's
reinstatement was an attack on feminism and as violation of their
academic freedom.
   ``I believe it was a violation of the rights of women in the
classroom, not to know why he was reinstated,'' said Elizabeth
Daugherty, who was a fellow student. She also claimed that she was
verbally attacked by the 6-foot-2 inch, 220-pound Schaub.
   Schaub and his supporters believe the instructors and their
assistants were hostile and vehemently anti-male.
   ``There was male bashing during which all white males were
described as child rapists and women abusers,'' said Schaub. ``I
had the feeling that if I were black or homosexual I wouldn't have
been discriminated against.''
   Schaub, an amateur bodybuilder who likes to refer to himself as
Peter Schwarzenegger after the bodybuilder turned actor, denied
charges he is anti-feminist, anti-homosexual or racist.
   ``I just think that this particular class hurts everyone. They
say that everything is racist and sexist,'' he said. ``They twist
it so far out of proportion that someone will not even listen to
them.''
   Committee Chairman Kent Pullen said the meeting was a
fact-finding hearing and that he didn't believe it was the
committee's job to delve into course content.
   ``I am confident the University of Washington administration can
resolve this issue, but I have a personal interest in freedom of
speech, the state's Equal Rights Amendment and the use of public
funds for political purposes,'' said Pullen.
   Asked why Schaub had been given credit for the course even
though he didn't complete it, Joe Norman, dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences, said it was an unsual situation and a review of
Schaub's work indicated he would pass the course if he completed it.
   As for charges that individual rights had been violated, Norman
said, ``our conclusion after exhaustive review is that the record
for winter quarter 1988 contains too much conflicting information
to warrant student disciplinary action.''
   Testimony before the committee also was conflicting.
   ``I found Women's Studies 200 a stimulating, exciting course and
it did not engage in male-bashing or racism,'' said Ms. Daugherty.
   But Mary Seward, another of Schaub's fellow students, said:
``When I asked a question about where a guest lecturer got her
information on Indians in Mexico, I was told that I was a racist. I
was told that all white people are racists and those who say they
aren't are practicing denial.''
   John Zehnder, another fellow student, said he did not find
Schaub either disruptive or disrespectful in class. ``The problem
arose because he was perceived as a threat to unusual teaching
techniques.
   ``The instructors presented erroneous or misleading statistics
and personal opinions as fact,'' Zehnder asserted.
   He also said he was told by an instructor that he would be
flunked if he ever used the words lady or girl in written work.

<TEXT>
   Four Navajo men were arrested Friday in
the Dec. 4 slayings of two Navajo tribal police officers believed
beaten and shot while trying to break up a desert drinking party.
   The arrests capped an investigation in which FBI and Navajo
authorities questioned more than 100 tribal members about the
discovery of the bodies in a burned-out police van at a remote
desert site near Monument Valley on Dec. 5.
   U.S. Attorney Brent Ward said the four suspects were residents
of Monument Valley, a reservation town near the Arizona border
where they were arrested.
   Thomas Cly and Marques Atene, both 22; Vinton Bedoni, 31; and
Ben Atene Jr., 24, a cousin of Marques Atene, awaited arraignment
on federal charges of first-degree murder on an Indian reservation
and aiding and abetting.
   Four to 10 FBI agents had been in Monument Valley since the day
after the slayings, said FBI agent Robert Bryant.
   ``When you have two fellow police officers brutally shot down,
it is a priority with our agency, and certainly with the others
involved. These arrests today will bring these individuals before
the bar of justice,'' Bryant said.
   Navajo police said tribal officers Andy Begay, 35, of Halchita,
and Roy Lee Stanley, 27, of Oljeto, appeared to have been beaten
and shot in the head after responding to a disturbance near
Gouldings shortly before midnight Dec. 4.
   An argument may have developed when the officers tried to break
up a drinking party at the site, where a bonfire had been built,
police said. Teeth matching one of the officers and pools of blood
were found there.
   The officers' vehicles were taken into Copper Canyon and set
afire, the bodies placed in the prisoner compartment of one of
them, Navajo police said.
   A $10,000 reward had been posted in the case. In February the
FBI said that suspects in the slayings had been identified but that
investigators could not persuade witnesses to testify because they
apparently feared retribution.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bush Quibble on Noriega Backing</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 3 grafs after 26th graf pvs bgng, `The
``mismanagement,' to UPDATE with new poll, reax from Gore</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis slammed the Reagan administration Friday for
putting ``drug-peddling'' Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega on the U.S. payroll, but Vice President George Bush
retorted that it is Libya that has been propping up Noriega with
millions of dollars.
   Jesse Jackson made fun of efforts by fellow Democrats Dukakis
and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. to claim leadership in the fight against
drugs, saying they are captains and lieutenants while ``I'm the
general in this war.''
   As the presidential campaign moved into the final weekend before
the pivotal New York primary on Tuesday, the rhetoric was tamed.
   For Republicans, it was a day for unity.
   Democrats aimed their fire mostly at the Reagan administration,
drug pushers and the owners of Eastern Airlines _ not at each other.
   Democratic front-runner Dukakis talked to Brooklyn junior high
school students about drug abuse, using wife Kitty's 26-year
dependence on diet pills as an example. The Massachusetts governor
used the low-key approach of a talk-show host in discussing drug
abuse, such as crack, the potent cocaine derivative.
   ``Crack can kill you, right? Who was killed by crack _ Lenny
Bias, right?'' Dukakis said of the former University of Maryland
basketball star. ``In about four minutes, that young man's life was
snuffed out.''
   Dukakis tossed aside a prepared speech on drugs, in which he
criticized the Reagan administration for paying Noriega money
through the Central Intelligence Agency before he was indicted for
drug-running.
   ``Why do we have the money for Star Wars but not for the war
against drugs? And why did you pay $200,000 a year to a
dope-peddling, gun-running Panamanian dictator?'' Dukakis' speech
said.
   Dukakis flew to Albany to meet with New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,
who fell back on an old phrase to describe Dukakis as a
``singularly important Democratic leader.'' Cuomo, who is not
endorsing anyone before Tuesday, had used almost the same words to
describe Jackson after a meeting Wednesday.
   For his part, Jackson continued his attack on drugs at the South
Jamaica housing project in Queens, where he compared drug dealers
to members of the Ku Klux Klan, who harassed and killed blacks
while wearing white hoods.
   ``Ropes, sheets and hoods represent death,'' Jackson told a
cheering crowd. ``We never lost as many lives to Southern rope'' as
to drugs.
   ``The dope pusher does not wear sheets and hoods, the dope
pusher is the hood who lives in the neighborhood,'' said Jackson.
   Bush, in a speech before the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, said Democratic charges that the administration had
propped up Noriega are ``demagogic statements.''
   ``It is this administration that has brought Noreiga to justice,
or at least taken the first step,'' Bush said. ``Noriega should go
and Noriega will go.''
   Bush added that Noriega has resisted the U.S. economic pressure
because of outside help.
   ``Several reliable sources indicate that he is receiving
millions of dollars in support from Libya,'' Bush said. He did not
elaborate on his sources.
   Otherwise, the Republican nominee-to-be talked of pulling the
party together for the fall general election.
   Bush had lunch with vanquished rival Sen. Bob Dole in his
Capitol office, standing together for the cameras as Dole
proclaimed, ``We're ready to go to work for George Bush.''
   Bush's remaining rival for the nomination _ former television
evangelist Pat Robertson _ admitted the GOP race is over and said
he would campaign for the nominee.
   ``It is obvious from the delegate count...that George Bush is
going to be the nominee of the Republican party absent any
unexpected eventuality,'' Robertson told the American Society of
Newspaper Editors.
   But he vowed to continue his minimalist campaign, saying he
hoped to ``energize the people who support me'' to play a role in
the GOP convention in August.
   Bush also planned a private meeting with former President
Richard Nixon.
   Gore, running a dismal third in the polls, temporarily dropped
his constant attacks on Dukakis and Jackson and took on Eastern
Airlines.
   Early Friday, he spoke to about two dozen members of employee
unions at the airlines, currently embroiled in a bitter labor
dispute and under close government scrutiny.
   The ``mismanagement of Eastern and Continental stands as a
symbol of the kind of approach Ronald Reagan and George Bush
encourage with their policies of hands-off, `Let 'em have whatever
kind of labor relations they want,' promote greed as the principal
guiding value for corporate America,'' Gore said.
   ABC News-Washington Post tracking poll released Friday evening
had Dukakis with 44 percent, Jackson at 37 percent and Gore at 10
percent. The poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday among 268
likely Democratic voters in New York, with a margin of error of 7
percentage points.
   On Thursday, the ABC-Post poll had Dukakis at 49 percent,
Jackson 34 percentand Gore 8 percent. That poll consisted of the
Wednesday interviews, of 176 likely Democratic voters, and had a
margin of error of 9 percentage points.
   Gore, speaking in Buffalo, N.Y., dismissed the poll results,
saying, ``The polls have consistently been wrong,'' and said the
undecided vote was beginning to go decidedly in his favor.
   Gore's campaign is now $1.6 million in debt after $100,000 in
new loans to finance New York ads.
   Dukakis, clearly tired of Gore's criticism in recent days, did
not resist a swipe at the Tennessee senator.
   ``I've got a competitor who is desperate to get in this race,''
he told reporters.
   Dukakis holds a widening leader in the fight for national
convention delegates, according to the AP count. The Massachusetts
governor has 842.15 votes to 730.1 for Jackson. Gore has 416.55,
while uncommitted delegates have 617.75 delegate voters.

   A jury recommended Friday that a
southwestern Missouri dairy farmer be put to death for killing his
wife and two nephews, including a teen-ager whom he had originally
blamed for the killings.
   The jury which convicted James E. Schnick of Elkland of three
counts of first-degree murder had the alternative of recommending
life in prison. If a judge accepts the jury's recommendation,
Schnick would become the 57th person on death row at the Missouri
State Penitentiary, where there has not been an execution since
1965.
   The Webster County jury Thursday found Schnick guilty in the
deaths of his wife, Julie, and two nephews, Kirk Buckner, 14, and
Michael Buckner, 2. On Friday, they recommended the death penalty
on all three counts.
   Schnick also is accused but was not tried in the deaths of his
brother-in-law, Steve Buckner; Buckner's wife, Jeannette; and the
Buckners' two other sons, Dennis, 8, and Timmy, 6. Buckner and Mrs.
Schnick were brother and sister.
   All the victims died in an early morning shooting spree Sept. 25
at the Buckner and Schnick families' dairy farms in nearby Elkland.
The Schnicks' two young children were not injured.
   Schnick originally blamed the slayings on his nephew Kirk, and
claimed he killed the boy in self-defense. The allegation shocked
members of the community who knew the teen-ager, who was described
as quiet and hard-working.
   Within days, however, Schnick himself was charged in connection
with the seven deaths. Police said he confessed during questioning,
but he claimed during the trial that the confession was not freely
given.
   Webster County Prosecutor Donald Cheever said the crimes were
aggravated by the fact that Schnick may have killed his wife in
order to collect life insurance. The number of victims, and the
youth of many of them, also prompted Cheever to seek the death
penalty.
   ``It's difficult to imagine anything more defenseless and more
helpless in this world than a 2-year-old asleep in his bed,''
Cheever said in his closing arguments. ``Anyone who would kill an
infant in those circumstances deserves the most severe punishment
possible under the law.''
   Schnick's attorney pleaded for her client's life, on behalf, she
said, of his two surviving children.
   ``No one is minimizing the terribleness or the horror of what
has occurred ...,'' Susan Chapman said. ``Healing comes with time
and love and compassion. It's not going to come with vengence.''
   Ms. Chapman had called Schnick's friends and family members to
attest that he had been a helpful neighbor and caring father. She
said their testimony proved that ``there is the possibility of
redemption.''
   Daniel Foster, chief of psychology at the Federal Medical Center
at Rochester, Minn., testified that after evaluating Schnick and
interviewing many of his friends, he concluded that Schnick strove
all his life to please others and was frustrated by his inability
to satisfy those closest to him when he lost control Sept. 25.
   ``The acting out that he did ... is very unlikely ever to be
repeated,'' Foster said.
   The defense contended during the trial that Schick's confession
was gained under pressure, and that he had been under the influence
of medication on the day of the shootings.
   Schnick's long-time physician, Dr. J.C. Presley, said he
examined Schnick Oct. 2, three days before his confession, and
prescribed a painkiller.
   ``It dulls the awareness,'' Presley said. `` It tends tp make a
patient sleepy and impair his intellectual function.''
   But county coroner Dr. J.D. Blinn, called as a rebuttal witness,
said he prescribed the same painkiller often during his 41 years as
a general practitioner, and rarely noted that his patients reacted
with drowsiness.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan will veto
the omnibus trade bill before Congress because Democratic leaders
insist on plant closure safeguards, U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter said Friday.
   He said the dispute could delay and possibly jeopardize
congressional approval of the historic U.S.-Canada Fee Trade
Agreement.
   ``The labor unions got their way,'' Yeutter told the Vancouver
Board of Trade in a luncheon speech prior to a weekend meeting with
the trade ministers of Canada, Japan and the European Community.
   He credited Congress with the ``almost unprecedented'' deletion
of dozens of protectionist portions of the trade bill, to the point
where Reagan might be able to sign it.
   But he said the Democratic leadership informed the
administration on Thursday that they would not discard a section
requiring owners to give substantive notice before any plant
closures.
   ``That legislation is objected to vigorously by the American
business community and the administration,'' Yeutter said.
   ``Therefore, the trade bill is going to be vetoed. We believe we
can sustain the veto, which means we're back to ground zero after
two or three years' work on a trade bill.
   ``That could have implications for the Free Trade Agreement.''
   He said at the very least, the trade bill battle will delay
consideration of the trade accord for about 30 days, and ``bruised
feelings'' in Congress could erode support for it.
   The trade deal was negotiated with Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney's Conservative government last year and is set to go in
effect in January if ratified by Congress and Canada's Parliament.
   It would eliminate all tariffs in the world's biggest trading
partnership over a 10-year period and loosen non-tariff and
investment barriers.
   Yeutter said he remains confident the trade pact will be passed
this year, but said the vote could come after Labor Day instead of
prior to the summer recess as Reagan hoped.
   He said it is possible that congressional leaders will amend the
U.S. trade bill before a final vote next Thursday or Friday, or
revise it quickly after a presidential veto.
   ``I certainly wouldn't reach the conclusion the Free Trade
Agreement is in mortal danger,'' he told a news conference.
   Mulroney faces re-election in the next year and had hoped to
have the trade agreement approved in time for a possible early
election this fall.
   Yeutter joined newly appointed Canadian Trade Minister John
Crosbie, Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura and Trade
Commissioner Willy De Clerq of the 12-nation European Community for
a weekend retreat on isolated Quadra Island near Vancouver.
   The regularly scheduled meeting was expected to focus on
progress in the Uruguay round of talks to revamp the 95-country
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   For the first time, Yeutter said, GATT is discussing world
trading rules for services such as insurance and computer software.
Washington also seeks more protection for patents, trademarks and
copyrights, as well as structural reform to improve the monitoring
of trade practices.
   He said he also looked for progress with Japan over higher
quotas for U.S. beef and citrus products. Otherwise, Yeutter said,
the United States will press its complaints before GATT.

   The Lesotho High Court voided the
national state of emergency Friday, declaring that the nation's
military rulers exceeded their powers when they imposed it Feb. 25.
   The Military Council led by Major Gen. Justin Lekhanya said it
would honor the decision. Lekhanya said in declaring the emergency
that its purpose was to counter a politically inspired crime wave.
   Security forces shot three people to death during the emergency.
   In a petition to the High Court, the Law Society of Lesotho
argued that Lekhanya did not have the powers to make the
declaration.
   It acted after three lawyers were detained two weeks ago under
emergency regulations. The court also ruled that the government
violated the rights of the detained lawyers.
   Lekhanya and the six-man Military Council assumed power in
January 1986 after ousting Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan in a
coup. Lesotho is completely surrounded by South Africa and
economically dependent on its powerful neighbor.

   A 15-year-old suspected crack user accused of
torching a home that his gang used as a hangout may have been
seeking revenge against a resident who had complained to police, a
detective said Friday.
   The resident's 12-year-old son was killed and six others injured
in the fire early Thursday.
   Antione Montgomery was accused of using a blowtorch to set fire
to a couch and a blanket in the house. He was arrested and charged
as an adult with murder, arson and assault Thursday.
   Queens Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said the 15-year-old
and as many as nine other youths had taken over a man's first-floor
apartment in the building about six weeks ago for ``fun and games''
and to package crack.
   Another resident, Eyvonne Perkins, 31, called police Wednesday
night to complain that two gang members were throwing rocks at her
second-floor windows. They were gone by the time a patrol car came
by, police said.
   Montgomery returned at 5:45 a.m. and started the fire, police
said.
   ``It would appear the way they were comfortable in this
residence was going to come to an end and they would probably have
to leave,'' Borrelli said in speculating that revenge was the
motive.
   The detective said the man in the first-floor apartment moved to
another part of the house because ``he was intimidated and
fearful.''
   The house is just a few blocks from where a rookie police
officer was shot to death at point-blank range in February while
guarding the home of a man who had complained of drug dealing in
the neighborhood.
   The Tactical Narcotics Team has made 560 arrests, 467 of them
for narcotics, since designating the neighborhood a target area
March 4.
   In addition to the death of Michael Perkins, three family
members and three firefighters were injured, said.
   Investigators are looking for the other youths ranging in age
from 15 to 20, Borrelli said.

   Former White House spokesman Larry Speakes quit
as chief spokesman for Merrill Lynch & Co. on Friday, days after he
created an uproar by admitting he twice concocted quotes for
President Reagan.
   Speakes said in a statement that his resignation was ``the best
course of action for Merrill Lynch and for me personally. Merrill
Lynch is a great firm and the industry leader, and I've enjoyed
being part of it.''
   The announcement reflected intense pressure on Speakes to resign
as head of communications at the Wall Street investment giant
because of his disclosures in a book about his tenure as White
House spokesman. He said in the book that he had attributed to
Reagan comments the president never made.
   Merrill Lynch said in a statement: ``We accept Larry Speakes'
resignation with regret. Larry has made a signficant contribution
to our firm during his time here, and we wish him well in every
regard.''
   However, a source familiar with Speakes' decision, who spoke on
condition he not be identified, said senior Merrill Lynch
management wanted him to quit because the phony-quote disclosures
raised serious questions about his credibility and by extension the
credibility of the company.
   Merrill Lynch spokesman Fred Yager declined to elaborate on
Speakes' resignation. ``I think the statement speaks for itself.
I'm not going to veer from the statement,'' he said.
   William Clark, another Merrill Lynch spokesman, said Speakes was
not in the company's New York offices and his whereabouts were
unclear.
   Sources at the firm said Speakes asked for a meeting earlier
this week with Daniel P. Tully, Merrill Lynch's president and chief
operating officer, to discuss the controversy. They said the
credibility issue was raised by Speakes.
   ``We took the attitude that he, being the communicator, knew
very well what this torrent of publicity was doing to him as our
chief spokesman and the image of Merrill Lynch as its chief
spokesman,'' one source said.
   Speakes joined Merrill Lynch with much fanfare 14 months ago.
Sources inside the firm said he earned between $200,000 and
$250,000 a year, about triple his $77,400 salary at the White House.
   He oversaw a staff of about 70 people with responsibility over
Merrill Lynch's press relations, corporate advertising and in-house
communications.
   Reagan, leaving Washington for a weekend at Camp David, Md.,
declined to answer reporters' questions about Speakes, saying only
``no comment'' just before he stepped into his helicopter.
   The resignation was announced after Speakes scrapped plans to
attend a White House Correspondents' Association dinner in
Washington next week as guest of the Washington Post. Earlier he
canceled an appearance at Denison University in Granville, Ohio,
because of what school officials called the controversy over his
new book, titled ``Speaking Out.''
   Speakes admitted in the book that on two occasions he attributed
to Reagan quotes that the president never said. Earlier this week
Speakes claimed he told Reagan about the quotes later, but Reagan
denied that.
   In his book, Speakes says he quoted Reagan as saying after the
downing of a Korean Air Lines passenger jet in 1983 by the Soviet
Union that the incident posed a problem not between the Soviet
Union and the United States but a ``Soviet versus the world
problem.''
   He said that comment really came from Secretary of State George
Shultz.
   Speakes said he also credited Reagan with some suggestions for
possible retaliatory measures, which also had been made by Shultz.
   In the other instance, Speakes says he quoted Reagan as telling
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev during their Geneva summit
meeting, ``There is much that divides us, but I believe the world
breathes easier because we are talking here together.''
   He said in the book that he and a press aide, Mark Weinberg,
concocted this quotation.
   The disclosures created an uproar among the present White House
press office staff and was criticized by a broad range of
professionals in the public relations business, who said it damaged
his credibility.
   Pamela Talbot, manager of the Chicago office of the public
relations firm Daniel J. Edelman Inc., said Friday that Speakes
probably would be able to find a job in public relations but that
it would be at a lower level and for less pay.
   ``He is still a major name in the business with powerful
connections who made a mistake,'' she said.
   Howard J. Rubenstein, president of a large New York-based firm
that bears his name, said Speakes is ``doing penance now. He's been
very severely damaged, but he's an intelligent person and I'm sure
someone would forgive him.''
   Speakes successor Marlin Fitzwater, who had excoriated Speakes
earlier in the week for the fabricated quotes, told reporters
Friday, ``I'm sorry for him, personally.''
   Fitzwater said he would comment no further.
   On Tuesday, Fitzwater, who succeeded Speakes as Reagan's chief
spokesman, had labeled his predecessor's conduct ``a damn outrage.''

   A bankruptcy judge granted PTL an
extension Friday to devise its reorganization plan, while the
ministry's court-appointed trustee said PTL would not be able to
make a $5.7 million payment due May 2.
   The trustee, David Clark, also said the ministry would lay off
an additional 125 people.
   PTL had been scheduled to make its first major payment May 2 to
start repaying the more than $60 million in debts accumulated by
former PTL leaders Jim and Tammy Bakker. However, federal
bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds gave the ministry until May 15 _ a
month from Friday _ to modify its reorganization plan to include
possible sale of assests to pay the debt.
   Reynolds warned Clark that PTL should be prepared to sell
property not related to the church or its television program to pay
its debts, assets the ministry had hoped to avoid parting with by
holding a monthlong telethon in March on its evangelical television
show. However, only $2.2 million was raised.
   ``I visualize an orderly liquidation,'' Reynolds said.
``Whatever's left (of the property) would go to the ministry.''
   Clark said the reorganization plan might be revised to include
the sale of $3 million to $4 million of undeveloped land this year.
Other assets, including the Heritage Grand Hotel, could be sold as
a last move, he said.
   David West, PTL's director of public relations, echoed: ``If we
made a list of priorities of assets that could be sold, the hotel
would be the last.''
   Linda Ivey, a spokeswoman for the PTL in Fort Mill, S.C., said
although the May 2 payment of $5.7 million was scheduled to be the
first payment under the reorganization plan, the ministry has
managed to pay some creditors ``bills that they knew would come up
under that process.''
   For that reason, and because of mounting legal and
administrative costs of the bankruptcy, the amount due creditors in
the May 2 payment has fluctuated. PTL administrators had estimated
last month they would owe about $4.2 million. However, as of Friday
the amount had risen to $5.7 million, she said in a telephone
interview.
   Reynolds gave PTL the extension after a hearing on a government
motion to delay the May 2 implementation of PTL's court-approved
plan.
   In the motion filed in federal bankruptcy court in Columbia,
S.C., Justice Department attorneys argued that PTL remains on shaky
ground with the Internal Revenue Service, which is seeking more
than $55 million in back taxes.
   The U.S. government appealed the PTL reorganization plan on Dec.
29, and still opposes it.
   The reorganization plan anticipates that PTL will qualify as
tax-exempt. But so far, the IRS hasn't agreed to PTL's request and
has warned that PTL may lose its tax-exempt status.

<HEAD>Navy Surgeon Released From Prison After Conviction Overturned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navy heart surgeon Donal M. Billig was
freed Friday from Fort Leavenworth, where he had been held for two
years, after his conviction in the deaths of three patients was
overturned on appeal.
   The U.S. Navy-Marine Court of Military Review ruled Thursday
that the evidence ``was simply not sufficient.''
   Billig, 57, was released about 11 a.m., according Lt. Col. John
Gerlinger, who said no other information about Billig's plans would
be released at his request. Billig told military authorities that
he would not meet with reporters.
   The Navy has 20 days to ask the appeals court to reconsider.
   Billig, who automatically returns to active duty with his
previous rank of commander, probably will be assigned to a reserve
center in Kansas City while the Navy decides to appeal, said Navy
spokeswoman Lt. Janet Mescus.
   Billig is also eligible for $120,000 in back pay.
   Billig was chief heart surgeon at the Navy's Bethesda Naval
Hospital in Maryland. He was convicted in 1986 of two counts of
involuntary manslaughter and one count of negligent homicide in the
deaths of three patients.
   He also was convicted on 18 of 24 counts of dereliction of duty
in other operations, and was sentenced to four years in prison.
   The appeals court said prosecutors ``lost sight of the fact that
coronary artery bypass surgery is an inherently risky business.''
   Prosecutors had argued that Billig used questionable surgical
techniques, but they never produced evidence or testimony to
demonstrate his work constituted criminal conduct, the appeals
court said.
   ``We shall set aside all findings of guilty based on this
factual insufficiency of the evidence,'' the court said.
   Prosecutors described Billig as an egocentric man who hid the
fact that he was nearly blind in one eye and continued performing
complex operations despite warnings that he was killing patients.
   The appeals court said it was troubled by Billig's conviction
because his court-martial involved criminal charges as opposed to
civil claims for damages based on negligence.
   ``We are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the deaths
that formed the basis of the appellant's conviction were due to any
negligence, simple or otherwise, on his part,'' the appeals court
said.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson compared drug dealers to Klansmen
on Friday and urged residents of a Queens housing project to
``drive drugs out of your neighborhood.''
   Campaigning for support in New York's Democratic presidential
primary next Tuesday, Jackson walked through South Jamaica House, a
low-income public housing project.
   As he walked through the project hundreds of residents crowded
around reaching out to shake his hand or, at least, touch his coat.
Others waved from apartment windows.
   ``Ropes, sheets and hoods represent death,'' he told them,
adding that ``we never lost as many lives to Southern rope'' as to
drugs.
   ``The dope pusher, the dope trafficker, the drug warlords
threaten the fabric of our lives,'' he said.
   ``The dope pusher does not wear sheets and hoods, the dope
pusher is the hood who lives in the neighborhood,'' said Jackson.
   The crowd cheered when he urged them to join him in an effort to
rid their neighborhood of drugs.
   ``Our minds must rebel against the drug pusher,'' he said. ``Our
attitudes must rebel against the drug pusher. Our morality must
rebel against the drug pusher.
   ``We must drive drugs out of your neighborhood.''
   From the project Jackson went to a drug rehabilitation center
run by the Jamaica Community Action Program, where he said that
``as president I can substantially cut the supply of drugs, but the
people must cut down the demand for drugs.''
   While he spoke Jackson aides passed out a written summary of his
anti-drug proposal, which includes a $2 billion increase in federal
spending to combat trafficking.
   At a breakfast meeting with community ministers, Jackson
ridiculed Reagan administration anti-drug efforts, as well as the
positions being taken by his Democratic rivals.
   He described Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee as captains and lieutenants in the war
against drugs.
   ``I'm the general in this war,'' he said.
   ``Now, everybody's fighting for the homeless,'' he went on.
``I'm a five-star general in that war.''
   He said other candidates were beginning ``to focus on teenage
mothers. Good, I'm the son of one.''
   Jackson also referred repeatedly to the shutdown of the
Williamsburg Bridge, a main commuter route between Brooklyn and
Manhattan.
   ``Because of lack of investment in the infrastructure, bridges
are falling,'' he said.
   ``We must rebuild the people even as we are rebuilding the
city,'' he said.
   Jackson later addressed several thousand people at a gay and
lesbian rally for his campaign in Greenwich Village.
   ``I stood with you because it was the right thing to do,'' he
told them.
   His statement that ``Testing for AIDS must be voluntary and
confidential'' drew loud cheers from the crowd that extended a full
block along 13th Street.

   Federal agents seized more than a
ton of cocaine hidden in frozen fruit pulp imported from Ecuador,
U.S. Customs officials said Friday.
   Suspicious Customs agents Wednesday had opened several plastic
containers of the pulp that arrived April 7, finding a 10-pound
packet of cocaine inside one, said agency spokesman Cliff Stallings.
   The shipment was put under surveillance and on Thursday two men
spotted unloading the containers were arrested on smuggling
charges, Stallings said. The pulp was thawed out and found to
contain about 2,500 pounds of cocaine.
   Customs gave no estimate of the value of the drug. However,
Metro-Dade police said that a pound of cocaine sells for $6,000 to
$12,000 on the street in Miami, depending on its quality and who is
selling it.
   Arrested were Nestor Pinango, 57, president of Frecar, the firm
to which the shipment was addressed, and Guillermo Gonzalez, 46,
also of Miami.

<HEAD>About 100 Americans to Testify at Trial of Suspected TWA Hijacker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 100 Americans will be
asked to testify at the trial of suspected TWA hijacker Mohammed
Ali Hamadi, court officials said Friday.
   Hamadi, jailed in Frankfurt, is charged with air piracy and the
slaying of of an American sailor in the 1985 hijacking of a
jetliner on a flight from Athens to Rome. The hijackers held 39
Americans hostage in Beirut for 17 days.
   A spokesman for Hesse state court, Judge Thomas Kehren, told a
news conference the West German government will pay expenses of
Americans who appear in court.
   ``Maybe 100 American citizens will be asked to travel from the
United States to testify at the trial,'' he said.
   Those who don't want to travel can give sworn depositions, he
added.
   The news conference was called to clarify why the Hamadi case
was turned over to a juvenile court by the adult state court in
Frankfurt earlier this week.
   Court officials also used the news conference to indirectly
criticize U.S. officials who are calling on West Germany to try
Hamadi as an adult.
   The juvenile court will determine whether to deal with Hamadi as
a juvenile, adolescent or adult, Kehren said.
   If the court treats the suspect as an adult, it could sentence
him to life in prison upon conviction. Hamadi could receive a
maximum 10-year jail sentence if tried as a juvenile and 10 to 15
years if tried as an adolescent, Kehren said.
   West German law defines a juvenile as anyone under 18 years of
age, an adolescent as 18 to 21 years old and an adult as 21 or over.
   The Hamadi case was turned over to the juvenile court because
there is ``doubt about whether he was 21 at the time he began the
process of committing the crimes he is charged with,'' the
spokesman said.
   The trial was to begin next month, but court officials now say
it will have to be put off for several months as the juvenile court
studies the case and arranges for witnesses to testify.
   The hijacking began June 14, 1985, a day after Hamadi's 21st
birthday, but officials say planning of the crime likely began
before he became a legal adult. Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt
Airport on Jan. 13, 1987, and charged with carrying liquid
explosives.
   The court's president, Judge Karl Stephan, said the case was
given to the juvenile court to prevent the suspect from appealing a
decision by a state adult court on the issue of his age.
   In Washington earlier this week, State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said ``we expect ... and hope that Hamadi will be
tried and sentenced as an adult.''
   But Stephan told reporters, ``No outside comments will be
allowed to influence the case.''
   Judge Horst-Guenter Haas, another official attending the news
conference, said, ``It is dangerous for a court if there is even a
mere appearance that outside considerations would be included in
its decision.''
   West German officials last year rejected a request that Hamadi
be extradited to stand trial in the United States for the slaying
of Navy diver Robert Stethem during the hijacking. The decision
came after two West Germans were kidnapped in Beirut.

   An American sailor who was aboard the USS
Samuel B. Roberts when it hit a mine in the Persian Gulf said
Friday he heard a thunderous blast and feared he would drown as the
sea rushed in around him.
   A hole was blasted in the side of the missile frigate and it was
being towed to Dubai for repairs. Ten sailors remained hospitalized
after the Thursday incident, and two were in critical condition.
   Defense Department officials in Washington said the frigate ran
into a virtual mine field in the central gulf. Department sources
said the Navy had dispatched four mine-sweeping ships to the area
to search for more explosives.
   Department spokesman Lt. Col. Keith Schneider said later that
two mines were spotted by the crew of a reconnaissance helicopter
and the devices were destroyed by a Navy team. He said the mines
were moored by cables to the bottom of the gulf but were visible
from the air.
   The navy will resume the search for more mines at daylight
Saturday, he added.
   Crewman Alex Perez of San Antonio, Texas, suffered a fracture of
the lumbar region and lay moaning in his bed at Bahrain's Salmaniya
Hospital.
   ``One minute I was sitting at the console, and the next, it was
all dark and I was down below,'' he said.
   Perez, 38, told The Associated Press that a lookout on duty had
spotted what ``looked like a mine, and the ship had already been on
general quarters (alert) for about five minutes before there was a
big sound.''
   ``The ship jumped up about four feet and there was water coming
in. The whole place just went dark,'' Perez remembered.
   ``It happened so quickly ... I thought I was lost. It was all
dark and all I could see was the fire from the burning engine,''
recalled Perez. ``I was in water ... I thought I was going to drown
... finally someone saw me and pulled me out of the water.''
   The incident, about 55 miles off Qatar, revived fears of the
mine threat in the waterway where Iran and Iraq have been at war
for 7{ years. U.S. warships escort American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers
through the waterway to protect them from Iranian attacks.
   On July 21, during one of the escort convoys, the tanker
Bridgeton hit a mine in the gulf.
   Defense Department officials said the Samuel B. Roberts
successfully maneuvered away from several mines and had come to
nearly a complete stop when the explosion occurred.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
field had ``numerous'' mines and that the seas were rough.
   ``At one point, there was 12 feet of water inside the engine
room,'' said one official. ``The crew just did a hell of a job. She
(the ship) took a really bad hit.''
   It wasn't known who planted the mines, but one Defense
Department source said they appeared to have been newly laid and
added, ``We certainly suspect the Iranians are behind it.''
   Salmaniya Hospital officials said two of the injured were in
critical condition with second degree burns to 40 percent of their
bodies. Another was suffering from second degree burns to 15
percent of his body.
   The other injured sailors were suffering from shock and were
under observation aboard the Navy combat stores ship San Jose.
   Other Navy warships rushed to aid the Samuel B. Roberts.
Together with the crew of the stricken frigate, these warships
conducted a nightlong salvage operation. They pumped the water out
and patched the hole, said Navy sources.
   The Navy said the 3,700-ton USS Samuel B. Roberts was in no
danger of sinking.
   The ship, based in Newport, R.I., left for gulf duty Jan. 11
with about 225 men aboard.
   The Iraqi News Agency reported Friday that warplanes bombed nine
Iranian cities, and Iran said 24 civilians were killed.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iranian
gunners fired six short-range missiles at ``military and economic
centers'' in Iraqi border towns.
   INA said Friday the Iraqi warplanes raided the nine cities,
mainly in western Iran. Iran said it fired six short-range missiles
into the port city of Basra and other Iraqi cities.

<HEAD>EPA Plans No Short-Term Sulfur Dioxide Limits Around Power Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency does not
plan to adopt air quality standards that would protect asthmatics
around power plants and other sources from brief bursts of sulfur
dioxide.
   EPA insisted it made the decision solely because it considered
health gains to be marginal, and did not consider at all the huge
costs that such a standard would impose on the utility industry.
   The agency estimated that 100,000 asthmatics live within 12
miles of a coal-burning power plant and might be exposed for one
hour per year to a burst of sulfur dioxide, and only about a
quarter of those would show any reaction. It had no estimate of the
number of people living near other potential sources such as
industrial boilers.
   Craig Potter, assistant administrator for air programs, said the
agency decided not to act because of the ``reversible, transitory
effects'' involved for ``a fairly small number of individuals'' who
``if sensitive to these kinds of exposures are likely sensitive to
other kinds of exposures and have medication'' that would protect
them.
   Nonetheless, the agency asked for public comment on whether it
should adopt a one-hour sulfur dioxide standard of 0.4 parts per
million.
   Environmentalists denounced the decision, which Michael
McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club, said ``starkly emphasizes
the Reagan administration's preference for protecting the
polluters' profits rather than public health.''
   From industry, Joe Mullan, environmental specialist for the
National Coal Association, said, ``Medical people coming to us are
finding that there is adequate control under current standards.''
   Outdoor concentration standards aimed at protecting health are
by statute required to be set without considering costs.
   Asked what criteria the agency was using to make what Potter
admitted was a ``tough call,'' Bruce Jordan of the Office of Air
Quality Planning and Standards said a new standard would ``disrupt
an ongoing regulatory program'' and Potter said the agency had to
consider the best use of its own resources.
   ``When you compare it (a short-term sulfur dioxide standard)
with other problems, with ozone, there is no comparison,'' Potter
said.
   Potter said excessive ozone damages the lung structures
irreversibly, something sulfur dioxide does not do in brief
exposures.
   A one-hour standard of 0.4 ppm to 0.5 ppm would probably require
fossil-fueled utilities to reduce annual emissions of sulfur
dioxide by 6 million tons, and a 0.2 ppm to 0.3 ppm standard would
require reductions of 10 million tons to 11 million tons, Potter
said.
   The larger figure is roughly half the current national total and
about the reductions called for in some bills being considered by
Congress to control the precursors of acid rain, of which sulfur
dioxide is an important one.
   The Edison Electric Institute has estimated that a 0.2 ppm
one-hour standard would cost the industry $5 billion a year, but a
0.8 ppm standard might be accommodated without major disruption.
   The other sulfur dioxide standards are not expected to be
changed, the agency said in announcing that it would take comment
from the public for 120 days before a formal decision.

<TEXT>
   Police said Friday they believe a Japanese
terrorist accused of attacking Western embassies around the world
parked a bomb-laden car outside the Naples USO club, killing an
American servicewoman and four Italians.
   Two Arab groups claimed responsibility for the explosion
Thursday night in a narrow street that runs past the the club,
where a party was being held to welcome destroyer USS Paul to port.
Seventeen people were wounded, including four U.S. sailors.
   All five people killed were just outside the USO. They included
Angela Santos, 21, of Ocala, Fla., who held the rank of radioman
3rd class and was based at the Naval Communications Area Master
Station in Naples.
   A man speaking accented English telephoned a French news agency
office in Rome on Friday and said the bomb was planted by a group
called Organization of Jihad Brigades. ``The American imperialists
must die today, two years after their barbarous attack against the
Libyan Arab state,'' he said.
   His reference was to the U.S. bombing of Libya on April 15,
1986, which was intended to punish the Arab nation for alleged
sponsorship of international terrorism.
   In Beirut, a statement signed by a group calling itself the
Islamic Jihad Organization for the Support of the Oppressed on
Earth said it ``claims responsibility for the attack launched by
our brethren holy warriors in Italy against American targets in the
city of Naples in which several imperialist soldiers were killed or
wounded.''
   The typewritten statement, in Arabic, was delivered to the
Beirut bureau of the Italian news agency ANSA. Its language
indicated the group was made up of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.
   Libya's ambassador to Italy denied involvement in the bombing by
Col. Moammar Gadhafi's government.
   In Spain, meanwhile, a bomb exploded Friday at a U.S. Air Force
radio relay station near an air base east of Madrid. It caused no
injuries, a U.S. Embassy official said.
   No group claimed responsibility. A Defense Ministry official was
quoted by the Spanish news agency EFE as saying the attack could be
related to the anniversary of the Libya raids.
   CBS News reported Friday night that the State Department sent a
cable to all U.S. embassies warning of possible attacks by
terrorists, but department spokesman Dennis Harter said he was
unaware of any such communication.
   Italian investigators said Friday that Junzo Okudaira of the
Japanese Red Army, which has links to terrorists in Lebanon, was
the prime suspect in the Naples attack. An international arrest
warrant was issued for him Friday.
   Romano Argenio and Ansoino Andreassi of Italy's anti-terrorist
police said they believed Okudaira, 39, had accomplices. They said
both claims of responsibility were being taken seriously.
   A law enforcement source in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said an FBI bomb squad left for Naples to investigate
whether the explosives used there are similar to those found in the
car of a Japanese man arrested Tuesday in New Jersey.
   State authorities detained Yu Kikumura, 35, after he was found
with three bombs in his car and a phony visa. Japan's Kyodo news
service reported that Kikumura had links to the Japanese Red Army.
   FBI spokesman Ray McElhaney said the agency has offered Italian
authorities its cooperation but he refused to confirm that an FBI
team had been dispatched.
   In December, Okudaira was charged in Italy with bomb and rocket
attacks on the U.S. and British embassies in Rome in June during
the annual summit of Western leaders in Venice. Several people were
wounded.
   He is believed responsible for similar attacks on Western
embassies in Madrid in 1986, the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta in 1985,
the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur in 1975 and the French Embassy in
The Hague in 1974.
   Argenio told reporters Okudaira is believed to be the man who
parked the explosives-laden car in front of the USO club.
   It detonated during a party attended by sailors from the Paul
and USS Capodanno. Lt. David Morris, a Navy spokesman in Naples,
said the party was in the basement, which made casualties lower.
   The explosives were packed into the trunk of a rented white Ford
Fiesta. Argenio said police believed Okudaira, identified through
witness descriptions, had fled Naples and likely left the country.
   Investigators said Okudaira was in Naples five days, staying at
the San Pietro, a modest hotel near the railroad station, under a
false name. Hotel officials said he left Thursday after paying his
bill.
   Naples officials declared a day of mourning for Saturday, when
funerals will be held for the four Italians.
   The street in front of the USO still was littered with glass and
burned-out cars Friday. Only the mangled front end remained of the
car that exploded.
   Inside the club were blackened walls, patches of blood, burned
shoes and pieces of clothing.
   Still intact on one wall was a sign reading ``USO Welcomes USS
Capodanno and USS Paul.''

   Procrastinators and folks simply trying to forestall the
inevitable _ taxes, that is _ made their annual trek to the post
office Friday to mail their 1040 forms.
   ``This happens every year,'' said John Tobias, mail supervisor
at the Willkes-Barre, Pa., post office.
   ``I think it's terrible that people have to wait for the last
minute,'' Tobias said. ``People call you today and ask you at the
last minute if you have tax forms in your office. And we don't.''
   Dan Jenkins of Mr. Tax of America in Jonesboro, Ark., said at 7
p.m. that his firm had 10 customers left with appointments before
the midnight filing deadline. ``My last one is at 8:30, which I
expect to finish about 11 p.m.,'' he said.
   Paul Monroe, regional manager for H&R Block in Boston, said he
sees the same people, year after year, in the waning hours of tax
season.
   ``They look forward to the excitement of April 15th. The
adrenalin starts flowing,'' Monroe said. ``It's like a non-contact
sport.''
   Postal Service consumer advocate Ann Robinson in Washington said
the post office expected to handle 30 million tax returns
nationwide in the ``last couple of days'' before the deadline.
   Post offices across the country were open until midnight to
place the all-important April 15 postmark on tax returns, or on
envelopes containing Form 4868 requesting an automatic four-month
extension of the deadline.
   ``We expect thousands to be here tonight,'' U.S. Postal Service
spokesman Vito Fortuna said Friday at New York City's main post
office. Tables and chairs were set up for those serious
procrastinators who arrived with their forms still blank.
   Anita Castro, a spokeswoman at the IRS' center in Andover,
Mass., said 450,000 returns arrived Friday morning with more on the
way.
   In past years, the center has received some strange returns such
as a coffin filled with dollar bills and checks written on edible
underpants. This year, she said, the center's 5,500 employees found
nothing unusual.
   ``So far it's just paper, paper, paper, tons of paper,'' Castro
said. ``It looks like a wagon train of paper.''
   Chicago taxpayers got a chance to vent their anger by throwing
luscious whipped cream pies at a mock IRS agent dubbed ``Shirdolph
Yurback,'' also known as Scott Goodman, part-owner of the Superior
Street Cafe.
   ``You know what I'm going to do with your taxes?'' he taunted
one passerby. ``I'm going to fund a study of South American
insects.''
   At $1 to $2 a throw, the stunt raised a couple hundred dollars
for a non-profit group for mentally retarded adults, Goodman said.
   It was party time in Springfield, Mass., where the post office
laid on a six-piece band, dancing raisins and a singing letter
carrier in a costume which was half Elvis Presley, half regulation
blue. His song: ``Return to Sender.''
   ``It's become a tradition,'' said Springfield Postmaster Jon
Steele, who decided in 1983 to liven up a long night and ease the
pain by offering free coffee and music April 15. This year a radio
station threw in free sandwiches.
   More than 7,000 tax returns were processed between 5 p.m. and 7
p.m., according to Mary Hartford, a spokeswoman for the post office.
   Dave Mazer, communications manager for the postal service in Los
Angeles, said no extra workers were called in Friday though some
employees would work overtime.
   ``Believe it or not, with automation, we can handle this
additional volume of mail with no problems,'' Mazer said. ``It is
really not that difficult for us. We do this every year as a public
service. ... We live in a world of people who do things at the last
minute.''
   In Atlanta, the Westin Peachtree Plaza concocted an 800-pound
cake decorated like an 11-foot-long Form 1040 and invited people to
``take a bite'' out of the IRS.
   Deadline Day publicity stunts in New York included free samples
of antacid which were distributed outside the main post office, and
an ``IRS Stress Relief Clinic'' opened by a toy company, which
invited taxpayers to come in and yell at a dummy.
   In Columbus, Ohio, 15 protesters from Ohio State University
displayed a missile made of income tax forms outside a federal
office building. They also erected a structure of cans of food they
said they would donate to the poor in lieu of paying taxes for
military purposes.
   State tax officials in Texas reported a pleasant surprise in
their mail Friday _ cashiers' checks totaling $82,000 from a
penitent but anonymous tax evader.
   ``Please forgive our mistakes and shortcomings,'' said a short
note, which explained that the names on the checks were not real.
   ``Maybe so,'' said Texas Comptroller Bob Bullock, ``but the
money is.''

   The number of Eastern Airlines planes grounded by
safety violations grew to at least 15 Friday as a federal crackdown
found problems including a fuel leak, a missing maintenance log and
a cracked wing flap, the Machinists union said.
   The airline and the Federal Aviation Administration refused to
confirm the number, saying they will detail no violations until the
inspection is complete. As of Thursday, the FAA had put the number
of planes grounded at six.
   ``They didn't want to see a running box score,'' FAA spokesman
John Leyden said of his agency's policy change after two days.
   The unprecedented inspection of all Eastern planes began after
the FAA slapped the company with a $823,000 fine for safety
violations. U.S. Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said
officials have been unsatisfied with Eastern's performance since
its 1986 takeover by Texas Air Corp., which also will undergo a
30-day inspection of its operating practices.
   Eight planes were found to have safety violations Friday
according to reports from union members around the country, said a
union spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of
company retaliation.
   The latest groundings were in Kansas City, Mo., Boston, St.
Louis, Tallahassee and Atlanta, the union spokesman said. Planes
grounded by safety violations can be returned to service once they
are repaired.
   In addition, union officials said a 757 in Atlanta was grounded
on Wednesday and its passengers ordered off minutes before the
flight was to take off for Miami because the airline had failed to
repair fire-detection wiring in an engine a week and two warnings
after it was reported by an FAA inspector.
   Four planes were briefly sidelined Friday in Kansas City for
violations ranging from a seat on a Boeing 727 that reclined to
block an emergency exit to a wheel well leak on a DC-9, the union
said.
   In Boston an A-300 AirBus was sidelined Friday with a wing flap
dent and a fuel leak in an engine. The plane was fixed later in the
day, the union said.
   A St. Louis flight to Miamia was held for repairs Friday
morning, the union said. The Boeing 727 was found to have a cracked
wing flap. Late Thursday, DC-9 bound for Atlanta, was taken out of
service after FAA inspectors found it lacked a flight maintenance
log and was missing landing bumper pads.
   In Tallahassee, the battery relay switch on a DC-9 was found not
to be working. The switch turns on the plane's electrical
equipment, the union spokesman said.
   A DC-9 taken out of service at Atlanta when inspectors
discovered a duct in the tail section was overheating, the union
spokesman said.
   The eight Friday groundings were in addition to six the FAA
reported on Thursday and the one reported to have taken place
Wednesday.
   Leyden said about 20 percent of Eastern's 267-plane fleet had
been looked over by FAA inspectors in 23 cities when the agency
stopped reporting its findings Friday morning. Inspections were
expected to continue as flights arrived in those cities during the
30-day review that began Wednesday.
   Eastern spokewoman Karen Ceremsak said news of the sidelined
planes was being overblown. Some mechanical problems occur daily,
she said.

   ``Colors,'' the much criticized movie about
Los Angeles' out-of-control street gangs, opened nationwide Friday
at 425 theaters amid protests and tight security following
predictions of audience violence.
   It also drew mixed reviews.
   About 15 theaters nationwide dropped plans to show the film,
according to reports, and at some Southern California theaters,
police frisked young people as they entered.
   Afternoon showings went off without incident at the busy
Hollywood Pacific theater. ``It has just been business as usual,''
said manager Michael Schnell.
   The theater added security guards for the film's opening, but
that was more in anticipation of the crowds than out of fear of
violence, Schnell said. The line for an afternoon show snaked a
block down Hollywood Boulevard.
   In the Los Angeles suburb of Huntington Park, police said they
planned to assign at least a dozen officers to the Pacific Warner
Theater. Huntington Park is just a few miles from Watts, home area
of several gangs.
   ``There could be some fights inside the theater,'' said
Huntington Park police Lt. Stan Ramsey. ``We're taking this
seriously. We'll have officers inside the theater and officers
outside.''
   ``There will be gang members there,'' Ramsey said. ``Definitely.
No doubt about it.''
   Between Jan. 1 and April 4, there were 89 gang-related deaths in
Los Angeles County. Last year, there were 387 gang-related deaths
in the area.
   The management of the Laemmle Grand theater near the Sheraton
Grand Hotel, just a short distance from gang turf, decided not to
show the film after staffers pleaded for their safety.
   A United Artists spokesman who asked not to be identified told
the Pomona Progress-Bulletin a decision was made several weeks ago
to pull the movie from some UA theaters, including one in
Montclair, where police in the past two years have staged two major
raids against drugs and gangs.
   Two real Los Angeles gangs, the Crips and Bloods, and their
respective colors of blue and red, are depicted in the movie that
stars Sean Penn and Robert Duvall as two officers assigned to fight
the gangs.
   The Orion movie was directed by Dennis Hopper, who spent the
week defending the film against critics such as the
Hollywood-Beverly Hills Chapter of the NAACP and Los Angeles City
Councilman Nate Holden, who suggested it should not be shown
anywhere.
   ``I'm showing you a real problem that exists,'' Hopper said
Friday on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``When you show a real problem that
exists, you don't go to the City Council and try to get the movie
dismissed.''
   Hopper's home in the Venice area was picketed during the week by
the Guardian Angels, the New York-based civilian crime-fighting
organization.
   The Guardian Angels also handed out pamphlets Friday to
theater-goers at the UA Coronet in the fashionable Westwood section
of Los Angeles, said the Angels West Coast director Scott McKeown.
   ``We are not going to stop anyone from seeing the movie. But we
are going to be exercising our constitutional right to protest
it,'' he said.
   The Angels also set up a picket line in New York City outside
the large Loews Astor Plaza Theater, just off Times Square.
   In Chicago, the founder of a group called Mothers Against Gangs
praised and criticized ``Colors,'' saying adults should see the
film.
   ``A movie has appeared that makes us all witnesses to the daily
horrors of gang wars,'' Frances Sandoval said at a news conference.
The film ``has done what hundreds of pleading, crying and angry
voices of mothers of victims of gang violence could not. It has
drawn national attention to the brutal reality facing our youth.''
   However, she criticized the film for not showing the
after-effects of gang violence. ``When a child is murdered it is
not all over,'' she said. ``It is the beginning of a living
nightmare for the family ... for the mothers.''
   Late Thursday a Chicago Police Gang Crimes Unit patrolman said
all 14 unit officers assigned to the South Side would be instructed
to stick close to a theater showing the movie and would be on
``radio alert,'' ready to help out if any violence were to occur.
The patrolman would not identify himself.
   In Florida, Dade County and city of Miami special units were on
alert but did not expect violence. ``Our gang unit is going to go
to the theater to see the movie, then hang out to identify more
gang members,'' said police spokesman David Rivero. ``But I don't
think they are going to have any incidents.''
   Reviews were mixed, with many critics focusing not on the
violence but on the time-worn ``old-cop, young-cop'' conflict
between Duvall's and Penn's character.
   ``The most shocking thing about the film is not that the movie
glorifies gang violence _ it doesn't _ but that it's about as
conventional as an `Adam-12' episode,'' Los Angeles Herald Examiner
film critic Peter Rainer wrote.
   But The New York Times' Janet Maslin said Hopper ``has a superb
eye for the poisonous flower of gang culture amid ghetto life,''
and noted also that while the movie was accused of glorifying gang
violence ``its sense of frustration is much too strong to support
that claim.''
   Los Angeles Times' critic Sheila Benson called it ``a
disappointingly superficial'' movie.

   A psychologist was indicted Friday on charges
of submitting false data to win a $200,000 federal research grant.
A federal prosecutor said the charges were the first of their kind
in the nation.
   Stephen E. Breuning, 35, was charged in connection with a grant
received in 1982 from the National Institute of Mental Health in
Bethesda while he was a faculty member at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical School.
   The money already has been repaid by the university, U.S.
Attorney Breckinridge Willcox said in a statement.
   Breuning, now director of psychological services and behavorial
treatment at the Polk Center in Polk, Pa., submitted a 1981 grant
request for a study titled ``Stimulant Drug Use with Mentally
Retarded Children'' while at the university from 1982 to 1984, the
statement said.
   The indictment said Breuning's applications cited the results of
seven studies of hyperactive mentally retarded children.
   Breuning ``knew the ... studies had not been completed at the
University of Pittsburgh as described,'' and that ``the studies
that were ongoing were not obtaining the results as described,''
the indictment said.
   Willcox said that the indictment is believed to be first time
criminal charges have been brought against an individual in
connection with falsified research.
   ``We have ... addressed a problem that I suspect is more
widespread than we think: fraudulent research data in the medical
field,'' Willcox said. ``Let this investigation send a clear
message to doctors and researchers who play fast and loose with
their research that they will have to deal with the criminal
justice system in addition to their peer review panels.''
   In addition to two counts of making false statements, Breuning
was charged with obstructing a National Institute of Mental Health
investigation by falsely testifying at a 1985 hearing that he had
submitted a ``corrected version'' of his grant request.
   ``We vehemently deny the allegations and think they're patently
untrue,'' Breuning said by telephone from his Pittsburgh home
Friday night.
   If convicted, Breuning, who holds a doctorate in psychology from
the Illinois Institute of Technology, could receive up to 10 years
in prison and $20,000 in fines on the false statement counts, and
five years and $250,000 in fines on the obstruction count,
officials said.
   George Huber, a spokesman for the University of Pittsburgh, was
not available for comment, a university employee said Friday night.

   Relatives of victims of the 1980
Kwangju uprising threw rocks at presidential security guards in a
cemetery Friday as President Roh Tae-woo visited the city.
   Students supporting striking workers battled police at campuses
around the country.
   Dissident sources in Kwangju said the attack followed rumors Roh
might visit Mangwoldong Cemetery, where many of the victims are
buried.
   Thousands of troops were mobilized to quell the May 1980
uprising in Kwangju that left at least 191 people dead and more
than 800 others wounded.
   Yonhap, the Korean news agency, said about 50 family members of
the Kwangju victims hurled rocks at five presidential security
guards inspecting the cemetery, seized their radio sets and smashed
windows of their minibus.
   Dissident sources said hundreds of riot police were deployed
around the cemetery immediately after Friday's attack and police
maintained tight security in Kwangju, the political base of
opposition leader Kim Dae-jung.
   Roh did not visit the cemetary.
   However, he did apologize for the Kwangju incident on behalf of
the government and urged citizens to bury their anger and work to
build national harmony.
   ``I will do my best to restore the honor of Kwangju citizens,''
Roh told 300 regional leaders at a city government office.
   The government officially apologized early this month for the
killings at Kwangju and offered to make compensations for its
victims.
   Thousands of students backing striking workers clashed with riot
police throughout the country. There were no reports of injuries or
arrests.
   Talks on reopening South Korea's second largest shipyard and car
plant bogged down Friday and labor unrest spread to other
businesses.
   The facilities are owned by the Daewoo group, one of the
country's largest conglomerates.
   An official with the Labor Ministry said eight new strikes broke
out Friday, raising to 349 the total number of disputes reported so
far this year.
   Of these, 266 disputes have been settled and 83 others were
continuing, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>`Last Emperor' Sparks Legal Controversy in Chinese Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debate over whether the Oscar-winning film, ``The
Last Emperor,'' was filmed illegally in the Imperial Palace was a
hot topic in China's legislature this week.
   Delegates to the National People's Congress called on Vice
Minister of Culture Ying Ruocheng to give his account of the
affair, according to a report earlier this week in the Beijing
Evening News (Beijing Wanbao).
   Ying, an accomplshed actor, was closely involved with the film
directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. Ying played the supporting role of
warden in the war criminals prison where the emperor is sent for
``remolding and education.''
   The film crew used Imperial Palace buildings to shoot interior
scenes, but filming is forbidden in the palace under China's
historical preservation law.
   The law, which took effect in April 1985, is aimed at protecting
wooden structures from irreparable fire damage.
   During the 1{-hour question-and-answer session held Monday, Ying
told delegates that the contract with the Italian film company was
signed in March 1984, before the preservation law was issued, the
daily said.
   In addition, he cited the value of propagating China's cultural
heritage through film and assurances that the film company would
use fire prevention measures, the paper said.
   The director of the National Historical Preservation Bureau, Lu
Jimin, also defended the filming in the palace.
   ``In light of the contract being signed first and, moreover, a
letter from officials of the Italian Communist Party requesting
help and cooperation, we decided to make this a special case.''
   Some congressional delegates complained that the treatment of
the foreign film makers was an affront to China's attempts to
develop a modern legal system and establish ``rule by law.''
   ``In the final analysis, did the contract obey the law or
overturn it?'' Hebei province delegate Li Zhuang was quoted as
asking.
   The debate was triggered when producers of an all-Chinese film
crew making a television series, also entitled ``The Last
Emperor,'' wrote a letter to a government advisory body in March
complaining that they had been denied access to palace buildings.
   ``Is law greater in China, or is power? Do foreigners have to
obey our laws or not?'' the letter asked.
   The letter appealed to the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference to ``criticize and halt unhealthy
tendencies and to reaffirm the integrity of Chinese lawmaking.''
   According to the Beijing Evening News report, Ying Ruocheng and
his colleagues promised that film or television crews would not be
given special privileges again.
   The delegates ended their annual session on Wednesday.
   The Chinese media has reported with little comment the awarding
of nine Academy Awards, including best picture, to ``The Last
Emperor.''
   The film has not reached Chinese theaters.

   Senators voted overwhelmingly to impose aid
sanctions on Mexico for its shortcomings in the war on drugs,
ignoring warnings that the move would damage relations with the
United States' third-largest trading partner.
   ``This may be just the signal Mexico needs to wake up before it
is too late,'' said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., a leader of the
effort to slap penalties on drug-producing and transit countries
that fall short in their enforcement efforts.
   But in Mexico City, the Foreign Ministry released a statement
condemning the Senate vote as ``foreign interference.''
   In voting 63-27 Thursday for the sanctions, the Senate ignored
vehement Mexican objections and a plea from President Reagan, who
had certified six weeks ago that the government there was ``fully
cooperating'' with the U.S. war on drugs and should receive all its
normal U.S. aid and trade benefits.

   The first return-filing season under the
broadest U.S. income tax overhaul in history closes out at
midnight. But the average American will have to work 20 more days
to keep federal, state and local tax collectors at bay for another
year.
   ``Tax Freedom Day'' will come May 5, the latest date since the
Tax Foundation began counting a half-century ago. If the government
took every penny you earned until your share of the total tax
burden were paid, the foundation reckons, you would have to work
the first 126 days of 1988 just to meet those obligations.
   Thirty years ago, Tax Freedom Day fell on April 10.
   Several million Americans didn't have time to fret about such
fanciful calculations. They were working up to the eleventh hour on
their 1987 returns, and many were sure to be standing in line in
front of mail drops as the midnight filing deadline approached.

   The report of a rising U.S. trade gap knocked
Wall Street's latest rally for a loop, triggering a $100 billion
selloff and leaving investors even more cautious about the nation's
economic outlook.
   The Commerce Department's report Thursday that the trade deficit

   The state of Texas is talking with the folks
who brought you the oil embargoes of the 1970s, looking for ways to
cooperate with the OPEC cartel in a bid to revive its struggling
oil industry.
   By itself, Texas is still the seventh largest producer in the
world, but its oil, real estate and banking industries have been
devastated since a 1986 oil price collapse.
   Texans ``cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand and hope
everything is going to be OK,'' says Kent Hance, one of the three
members of the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oil
production in the state.
   Hance met earlier this month with Rilwanu Lukman, the president
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and discussed
the possibility that his state and the cartel would cooperate. More
contacts are planned.

   The nation got its first big dose of inflation
this year as wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 7 percent
in March, the government said Friday. The report sent new tremors
through financial markets already shaken by a worsening U.S. trade
deficit.
   The Labor Department's producer price index rose 0.6 percent
last month, marking the biggest increase since April 1987 and more
than erasing a 0.2 percent decline in February.
   Falling energy and food prices that had been keeping a lid on
inflationary pressures shot upwards in March, as did wholesale
prices for a wide marketbasket of other consumer goods and capital
equipment.

<HEAD>The High Voltage Excitement of Sonia Braga</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She never went to acting school, but Sonia
Braga has managed to convey high-voltage excitement in such films
as ``Dona Flora and Her Two Husbands'' and ``Kiss of the Spider
Woman.'' Now she's doing the same in Robert Redford's ``The Milagro
Beanfield War.''
   Braga plays Ruby, a tenacious garage owner who organizes a civic
revolt against the land marauders of a New Mexico village. It's
another remarkable performance for the actress who began her career
in Brazilian soap operas.
   Here for the opening of ``The Milagro Beanfield War,'' Braga
recently talked about her career in an interview that covered a
wide range of subjects, usually in brief bursts of conversation.
Her English is amazingly good, considering her recent acquaintance
with the language.
   ``I started learning English about four years ago,'' she said.
``I went to visit a friend in New York, and since I wasn't doing
anything at the time, ... I decided to stay and learn the language.
I'm glad that I did that. Language can be a big barrier between
people. If you want to know a people, you have to learn the
language.''
   The actress first heard about ``Milagro'' while she was serving
on the jury of the Cannes Film Festival three years ago. Her agent
told her that Robert Redford wanted to talk with her about a role
in the film. On her way home to Brazil she stopped in New York.
   ``I read the script and I really, really loved it,'' she said.
``Then I met Robert, and we talked. I was too excited about the
character to be nervous. I was very, very touched that someone
would want to make a movie about `Milagro.'
   ``Then I made a screen test three times. I had three or four
more interviews with the producers and the director. Then I went to
New Mexico.''
   In the movie, a New Mexico hamlet is being squeezed to death by
a resort developer with the help of the state governor and his
venal staff. The officials even send a hatchet man to terrorize the
residents, mostly Hispanic, when they grow restive under the rape
of their land.
   The reluctant leader of the revolt is a small landowner who
inadvertently diverts the land baron's water into his beanfield. He
becomes defiant, and others strive to make it a crusade, especially
Braga.
   What's it like to be directed by Robert Redford?
   ``He's very sensitive,'' Braga said. ``I think that's not only
because he's an actor and he understands the problems of actors.
That's the quality that some people have. He is very into certain
important things, like the environment.
   ``He is totally open to suggestion. If you're doing well, he'll
just let you go. For instance, Ruben Blades (who plays Sheriff
Montoya) is a natural actor. He was so much the character that
Robert just watched him do it. But when he sees that you are going
the wrong way, he leads you back to the right way for the movie. If
you have any suggestions about the character, he will listen to you
and make some changes.''
   The dark-haired beauty has been working since she was 14. After
playing children, she did a production of ``Hair'' for two years.
   ``Then I started doing soap operas,'' she said. ``One of the
soap operas, `Gabriella,' was written by Jorge Amada, who also
wrote `Dona Flor.'''
   The film brought her international acclaim, as did ``Kiss of the
Spider Woman,'' her first film in English.
   She welcomes more opportunities abroad since the Brazilian film
industry has been ailing because of the country's financial woes.
The country's major filmmakers have abandoned Brazil for Hollywood,
making movies in English instead of Portuguese. Hector Babenco
(``Kiss of the Spider Woman'') shot ``Ironweed'' with Meryl Streep
and Jack Nicholson in Albany, N.Y.

<HEAD>Brazil's Slum Theaters Tell of Shantytown Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY LISA GENASCI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new kind of community theater is
drawing attention to Rio's shantytown slums, where residents are
telling the story of their grim reality through plays.
   Slum theater is a sharp break from the mainly white,
European-influenced fare of Rio's theaters. Its supporters hope it
will bring greater artistic recognition for popular culture, which
in the past has meant little more than Carnival samba.
   ``Popular theater has become the most important movement within
Brazilian theater. It's exciting to see a hidden people expressing
themselves,'' said Antonio Pedro, the city's secretary of culture,
in an interview.
   In the past three years, the city government has helped to start
theater groups in most of greater Rio's 434 slums, which are home
to an estimated 4 million of the metropolitan area's 10.3 million
residents.
   One group is in the Manguinhos slum, or ``favela'' in
Portuguese, Brazil's language. Like other favelas, Manguinhos is a
jumble of slapped-together wood or tin shanties, inhabited mostly
by blacks earning close to the official minimum wage of about $50 a
month.
   Three times a week, 26 residents meet for a two-hour rehearsal
in a newly built community center.
   The characters in the play are a common slum family: a mother
who takes in washing to support the family; an unemployed father
who drinks and gambles away the meager income; a son wanted by the
police; a daughter who is raped by the landlord when the family
cannot pay the rent on its two-room shack.
   In the play, the family's luck changes when the father wins the
lottery and becomes a slumlord himself. He buys up shacks, expels
former friends, builds a mansion in the slum and finally moves out
to the fashionable Copacabana Beach district, cutting ties with the
favela.
   Although most of the actors have full-time jobs and many study
at night, few miss rehearsals.
   ``I go crazy on nights when there is no rehearsal,'' said
Antonio Rodrigues, 29, who plays the landlord.
   The play later was to enter an amateur theater competition and
travel for performances in neighboring slums.
   Jesus Chediak is a pioneer in the popular theater movement. He
has helped to form some 200 groups in favelas around Rio.
   The first obstacle to starting a group, he said, is to convince
the community he is not with the police. Another challenge is
coping with interruptions such as gang wars, police raids and
weddings.
   ``We try to give people a sense of their own value and teach
them to respect their community through theather,'' Chediak said in
an interview.
   The plays often start as personal recollections or stories about
slum life, which then are woven in to drama. Chediak trains his
students to collect these oral histories.
   One of his pupils is Yvete Rodrigues, a 25-year-old drama school
graduate, who is starting a group in the Cascatinha, or Little
Waterfall, slum.
   Rodrigues recorded seven full tapes of interviews with the
slum's older residents. The tapes later became the basis for a play
of several sketches telling the story of the community.
   ``People are creative but closed after years of repression of
popular culture. My job is to pull this creativity out of them,''
she said.
   Some see slum theater as a step toward independence from outside
influences, especially from Europe which has overshadowed theater
here ever since Spanish Jesuit missionaries first used morality
plays to evangelize native Indians more than 400 years ago.
   ``Popular theater is more Brazilian than anything we've seen,''
said Luiz Mendonca, who has directed slum theater groups as well as
conventional plays.
   In the 19th and early 20th centuries, visting European troupes
set the model for Brazilian drama. During World War II, a wave of
talented European directors came to this country to flee the
turmoil.
   In the 1950s, some young groups tried to turn Brazilian theater
toward national themes. But a 1964 right-wing military coup imposed
sweeping censorship and was especially harsh on community theater,
which was considered subversive. The military regime ended in 1985.
   Slum theater also is a forum for discussing community action
projects.
   Maria da Costa, a 24-year-old actress in the Cascatinha group,
said residents often use the rehearsals to discuss how to obtain
electricity, running water, paved streets and other services the
government has not provided for poor areas.

<HEAD>NBC Documentary Examines Life in Women's Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A TV program called ``Women Behind Bars'' sounds
like some cheap attempt to boost ratings, but it's an NBC News
documentary that turns out to be a sophisticated examination of a
growing social problem.
   Unlike the stereotypes of tough tootsies that exploitation
movies foster, correspondent Maria Shriver reports in the one-hour
documentary Tuesday night that most women in prison are there for
economic crimes like hot-check writing or welfare fraud and that
most are single mothers with children under age 3.
   Once in prison, the only job training they are likely to get
will prepare them for low-paying jobs as cosmetologists, domestics
or food servers. In the meantime, their families are uprooted and
their children put in foster homes.
   For ``Women Behind Bars,'' NBC went to Dwight Correctional
Institution in Illinois and talked to inmates who, in fact, are
rarely behind bars. At first glance, Shriver notes, the institution
looks like the campus of an all-girls college. Inmates stay in
rooms, not cells, though they are locked in at night.
   ``The time you do here is mental time,'' says one inmate.
   The inmate says she's seen the prison's population triple in the
seven years she's been there. ``Equal opportunity has brought women
the equal opportunity to go to jail,'' says Shriver.
   The institutions lag behind society in enlightened views of
women's roles and appropriate behavior.
   A warden notes that female inmates are more likely to be
reported for minor misbehavior, such as insolence, than are men,
because women are expected to be ``ladies.''
   Instead of preparing women for the challenge of returning to
their communities, getting jobs and taking charge of their lives,
women's prisons tend to make female inmates more dependent, as
opposed to men's prisons where inmates are likely to become more
violent.
   Shriver asks one women who has been imprisoned several times why
anyone take a chance that could send them back.
   Back home, without support, says the inmate, ``you're going to
do something to survive, no matter what the consequences.''
   The biggest problem for women in prison is the separation from
their children. Sometimes they don't even know who is raising them.
As interviews with weeping inmates attest, women in jail care just
as much about their children as women anywhere.
   One young woman has just arrived to begin serving a 13-month
sentence for burglary. She is five months pregnant and has two
children in a foster home. When the baby is born it, too, will go
to the foster home.
   ``They'll be too young to remember _ I hope,'' says the woman.
   If they get to visit mom in jail, children can be further
traumatized. The cameras show a 3-year-old boy being searched by a
prison guard. Another small boy, when asked ``where's mama?'',
points to the foster mother who brought him, not the real mother
who is sitting next to him. Children wail when they are again
wrenched from their mothers at the end of visiting hours.
   Of the one in five women who are serving long sentences for
violent crimes, many were battered wives who killed their husbands,
Shriver says. Again, contrary to stereotype, they are unthreatening
and stay in lower-security blocks. Statistics show most are
middle-class and unlikely to commit another crime once released. In
prison, they do their time quietly.
   Maximum security, Shriver reports, is occupied mostly by younger
inmates with long criminal records, even if the individual crimes
are not especially severe. Repeat offenders are more likely to be
rebellious.
   Violent inmates are put in ``segregation,'' left alone in a
room. One tough inmate spends her time in solitary writing poignant
essays about prison life.
   ``Prison is a place,'' she writes, ``where you learn nobody
needs you, and the world goes on without you.''

   Unless you obtained an extension, your income
tax returns are now behind you, leaving time to dwell upon the
myriad thoughts that had entered your mind and then fled because of
deadline stress.
   Such as: Didn't Congress pass what it called a tax cut? Weren't
the returns supposed to have been simplified? Is it really possible
for anyone to file a number-perfect return _ that is, without
paying too much or too little?
   And: If those people who are trained by the Internal Revenue
Service to interpret the tax code cannot reach agreement among
themselves, how can justice be dispensed? And if it cannot, how can
faith in the system be maintained?
   But these questions don't even deal with the problem having
perhaps the greatest economic significance of all: How can the
nation tolerate the lost time, the lost creativity and energy, the
lost productivity of it all?
   America's 100 million taxpayers have spent at least 2 billion
hours preparing for and making out their state and federal tax
returns, according to estimates by a University of Michigan
professor.
   Joel B. Slemrod, director of the school's Office of Tax Policy
Research, estimates the bill for complying with state and federal
tax laws totals as much as $27 billion this year. It averages about
$275 a household.
   It might be noted that this effort, no matter how measured,
wasn't expended on making a better production line, inventing a
product, improving health, teaching a student, aiding the needy,
building a house or exporting a product.
   Essentially, although perhaps not totally, it was
non-productive. And maybe regressive as well. Slemrod found that
the lowest income class had relatively higher compliance costs than
the highest income group.
   (However, the tax reform legislation did drop 6 million
low-income individuals off the tax rolls by increasing the standard
deduction and personal exemption.)
   While Slemrod's numbers might seem high, most likely they are
not. His research was conducted on a group of Minnesota residents
who filed state and federal income tax returns for 1982, well
before the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
   He found that back then it took a taxpayer 21.7 hours a year to
complete taxes, two-thirds of that time being devoted to
record-keeping, one-tenth to research and one-fifth to filling in
the blanks on the form.
   He did not, it seems, take into account the amount of time that
some of these people might subsequently have spent in defending
their returns during audits, nor the average cost of maintaining
storage and work space in the home.
   The lost productivity involved in such activities might make any
other dollar figures from such studies seem minor. True, a lot of
people would have used the time sleeping, but conceivably that made
them more productive the following day _ certainly more so than the
worker who spent the night on taxes.
   The route to resolving this annual dilemma isn't easy; in fact,
it might involve as many dead ends and reverse turns as the
ordinary taxpayer faces in getting to the bottom line _ the line
where he or she finds the taxable income.
   For example, simpler isn't necessarily better, says the
professor, simply because simpler can be unfair. ``To be fair and
effective, there must be a certain amount of complication,'' he
says.
   The level of frustration might be read on a blood pressure gauge
when you realize that simply to change to a simpler system might
only compound the problem, since everyone would have to learn the
brand-new system.
   But in the name of economic productivity, millions of Americans
today might agree that there must be a better route to the bottom
line on the tax form.

   CBS announces its fall schedule next month, and
``Wiseguy'' producer Stephen J. Cannell is asking viewers to write

changes are in store for next fall. Now is the time for viewers to

notably ``Cagney & Lacey'' and ``Designing Women.''
   ``You've got a network under a certain amount of pressure right

Cannell in a telephone interview from his Los Angeles office, which
he said was stacked with almost 2,000 pieces of mail.
   ``I've never had a show that drew mail like this one, and it
isn't stuff written in Crayola,'' said Cannell, who has produced
and written such hits as ``The Rockford Files'' and ``The A-Team.''
   Cannell is sending the letters to CBS Entertainment President
Kim LeMasters and appealing to viewers to write LeMasters directly.
   ``Kim and all the people at CBS really love the show, so it's
not a matter of them saying, `We don't see it,''' said Cannell.
``They're sort of scratching their heads, too, and saying, `How can
we make this thing happen?' I just want to make sure `Wiseguy'
doesn't fall through the cracks as management screening starts.''
   ``Wiseguy'' is among the best dramas on network television and
one of CBS' best shows. But in its premiere season it got low
ratings, because of continuing plotlines but especially because of
time slots.
   It started out Thursday nights opposite NBC's top-rated comedy
lineup, then moved to Monday nights where it was frequently up
against miniseries and movies on the two other networks or
pre-empted by miniseries on CBS.
   The premise of the show is daring. Ken Wahl stars as Vinnie
Terranova, a government agent who goes deep undercover into crime
organizations. Such investigations take years in real life. On
``Wiseguy'' they take several weeks, an eternity on network
television where viewers are likely to be put off by a continuing
storyline, figuring if they missed the first few episodes, they
won't be able to catch up.
   Cannell would solve that problem next season by bringing viewers
up to date before each episode.
   This season, the first eight episodes featured Ray Sharkey as
New Jersey crime boss Sonny Steelgrave, a villain so likable Vinnie
flirted occasionally with crossing the line between cop and
criminal.
   After Sonny was vanquished in a two-part conclusion that would
have made a respectable theatrical release, enter a new villain,
alternately charming and lunatic Mel Profitt, played by Kevin
Spacey.
   Cannell is hoping the show will rack up some Emmy Awards this
summer the way NBC's ``Hill Street Blues'' did after almost getting
canceled for low ratings its first season.
   ``Wiseguy'' has a number of likely nominees for acting Emmys,
including Sharkey and Spacey, plus William Russ, who in the Profitt
storyline played CIA operative Roger Lococco, hit man with a heart
of gold.
   Another likely candidate is series regular Jonathan Banks who
has turned Frank McPike, Vinnie's irascible boss, into one of the
most intriguing supporting characters on television.
   CBS was set to start running repeats of the Sonny Steelgrave
``arc,'' as the show's producers call each storyline, but pulled
the episodes to await a decision on whether the show will be
renewed.
   If it is picked up, Cannell said, CBS will rerun the episodes
this summer in the show's new time period to help it build an
audience. ``Wiseguy'' fans will have their VCRs ready.

<HEAD>Fred Silverman's Programming Instinct Still Working</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fred Silverman's famed ``golden gut''
instinct as a television programmer still seems to be in working
order.
   Silverman, former network wunderkind, now an independent
producer, got CBS to move his faltering series, ``Jake and the
Fatman,'' to Wednesdays. In the most recent ratings period the show
had jumped to 21st place, up from 43rd the week before.
   The show also won the time period, beating NBC's ``A Year in the
Life'' and ABC's ``Hooperman'' and ``Just in Time.''
   ``If you have a show with inherent strength, it's to everyone's
advantage to try to save it,'' Silverman said in an interview.
   ``The time period can be as important as the show itself. `Jake
and the Fatman' had been on on Tuesdays, where it was up against
ABC's `Moonlighting' and later NBC's `Hunter.' It was tough
competition and we had no lead-in to speak of.''
   The lead-in for ``Hunter'' is another Silverman show,
``Matlock.'' And if ``Jake'' stayed on Tuesday nights, its
competition would be a third Silverman series, ``In the Heat of the
Night,'' on NBC.
   Silverman was head of programming at CBS when it was No. 1 in
the ratings in the 1970s. He moved to ABC as entertainment
president in 1975, and ABC was soon the ratings winner for the
first time. The ``golden gut'' tag came from his acknowledged
decision-making on gut reaction.
   In 1978, he became president of NBC, but in three years was
unable to budge the network out of third place.
   After Silverman left NBC, he started his own production company.
Besides the three network series, his company also produces the
highly successful ``Perry Mason'' movies for NBC. He also plans to
bring back ``Burke's Law,'' the 1963-66 ABC series starring Gene
Barry, as a series of TV movies. He is working on a movie series
for Home Box Office about a former cop who becomes a lawyer, a role
he says would be good for Charles Bronson.
   ``My area of greatest expertise at the networks was the
half-hour comedies,'' said Silverman. ``I want to get into
comedies. Most of the shows in syndication are comedies that I
developed at the networks.''
   In ``Jake and the Fatman,'' William Conrad stars as J.L.
``Fatman'' McCabe, a tough district attorney. Joe Penny is Jake
Styles, his smooth and mysterious special investigator. The show
made its debut last September.
   ``My feeling is that when you change a show to a new day and
time it takes about a month to settle in,'' said Silverman. ``The
history of television has shown that sometimes you can save a
failing show by moving it to a new time period. It's more than just
wishful thinking. `Bonanza' was on Saturday against `Perry Mason'
its first two years. It barely survived, but RCA wanted to keep it
on because it was in color and was helping to sell color sets.
   ``Then NBC moved it to Sunday nights at 9 o'clock. After that it
was in first place or near first for the next 10 years. `The Dick
Van Dyke Show' floundered its first year on Tuesdays. It was a
Procter & Gamble show and they insisted it get a shot in another
time period. It became a hit on Wednesdays.''
   ``All in the Family,'' ``M-A-S-H,'' ``Hawaii Five-0'' and
``Cannon'' were also shows that benefited by a time change.
   ```All in the Family' started on Tuesday nights between `Hee
Haw' and `The CBS News Hour,''' said Silverman. ``I don't think
anybody had any great faith in it. But we were having trouble with
a show on Saturday night and moved `All in the Family.' It just
exploded.
   ```M-A-S-H' just died on Sunday night, then it was moved to
Saturday behind `All in the Family.' It became second in the
ratings. `Hawaii Five-0' didn't do well until CBS switched it with
`The Jonathan Winters Show.' `Cannon' started at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday,
where it was up against the ABC movie and `Marcus Welby, M.D.' The
next year we moved it to Wednesday and it became a hit.

<HEAD>Peter Ustinov Plays Beethoven's Ghost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUERGEN METKEMEYER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Peter Ustinov, whose roles have ranged from
Babar the Elephant to Rome's mad emperor Nero, is now playing
Beethoven's ghost before packed houses in West Berlin.
   The play, ``Beethoven's Tenth,'' was written by Ustinov and has
been performed in the United States and in Britain. However, its
West Berlin debut at the Schiller Theater marks the first time
Ustinov has delivered his lines in German.
   Ustinov, who turned 67 on April 16, admits that speaking German
is his biggest challenge in the performance.
   ``For me, every night at the Schiller is a premiere,'' he said
in a recent interview. ``German is a difficult language. It forces
me to attempt linguistic acrobatics with my mouth that I'm not used
too; I'm constantly in danger of getting stuck.''
   For the interview, Ustinov made his remarks in nearly fluent but
cautiously enunciated German.
   The play opened in West Berlin in January and has been sold out
ever since. More than 40,000 people are expected to see the
production before its scheduled April 30 closing, Gisela Huwe, a
theater spokeswoman, said.
   ```Beethoven's Tenth' is one of the greatest successes in the
40-year history of the Schiller,'' Huwe said of the two-act play
written by Ustinov.
   Much of the play's action concentrates on efforts by a fictional
London music critic named Stephen Winter to imagine how Beethoven's
10th Symphony might have sounded. It also focuses on his often
stormy relations with his son, Pascal, who composes modern
symphonies which Winter has no use for.
   A Viennese au-pair girl named Irmgard, who loves Beethoven and
Pascal, manages to wake the composer from the dead. The composer
rings the doorbell and strides, with long hair flowing, across the
stage.
   With the help of a hearing aid provided by the family doctor,
the old deaf master is able to hear his symphonies for the first
time.
   Ludwig van Beethoven's last completed symphony is his ninth _
The Choral. Music researchers, however, say they have discovered
sketches for an unfinished symphony, possibly a 10th, dated after
completion of his Ninth Symphony and before his death in 1827.
   In Ustinov's play, the audience never learns how the 10th
Symphony really sounded, but the resurrected genius helps bring the
feuding Winter family closer together.
   Critics say Ustinov's often deliberate German delivery adds to
the performance, increasing audience empathy to the character of
Beethoven, who makes a grumpy visit to the 20th century in a
rumpled coat and wig after 160 years in the grave.
   Ustinov said he especially enjoys playing on the West Berlin
stage.
   ``The actor is in direct contact with the audience here,'' he
said. ``The people are very warmhearted.''
   Ustinov is internationally known for his versatility as a stage
and screen actor, and in recent years has become best known for his
portrayal of Agatha Christie's Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot.
   He has written several other plays, a collection of short
stories and a novel.
   In film, he gained prominence for his portrayal of Nero in
Mervyn Le Roy's 1951 Hollywood epic, ``Quo Vadis.'' He is also
known as the voice of Babar the Elephant, a popular children's book
character created by the late French author Jean De Brunhoff.

<HEAD>Diego Rivera Mural in Post-Quake Museum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAVIER PICHARDINI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There once was a time when people could sit
in the bar of the old Hotel Del Prado and enjoy looking at Diego
Rivera's mural, ``Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in Alameda Park.''
   The once elegant hotel is now an earthquake-damaged hulk waiting
to be demolished, and the mural is in its own museum pavilion
across the street.
   The delicate transfer of the mural has been completed. It
escaped damage in the Sept. 19, 1985, earthquake that killed
thousands and devastated large parts of the city.
   The famous mural is open to the public again, like a window
opened on Mexico's rich history. It shows figures from the Mexican
political and art worlds and from daily life all on parade in the
park.
   An explanation at the entrance to the new museum says the
decision was made to transfer the mural from the hotel after the
extent of the damage there became clear.
   ``It should be linked to the Alameda, for having been painted on
that theme and for the place itself,'' the plaque from the National
Fine Arts Institute says.
   The Alameda, the downtown park across the street and down a
block from the mural's old home, also was expanded through
earthquake reconstruction programs. A ``Solidarity Garden''
recalling the victims of the 1985 disaster was built on the site of
the cleared, adjoining block that once held a department store and
the Hotel Regis.
   The mural's pavilion is built on the site of the hotel's parking
garage, which was badly damaged and demolished after the quake.
   The Fine Arts Institute said that no room could be found in any
of its buildings close to the Alameda, ``because of the colossal
dimensions of the work. ... That's why it was decided to take
advantage of the possibility of constructing an appropriate
building.''
   In place of the old hotel's comfortable cocktail lounge, viewers
now can sit on three simple benches placed in front of the mural or
just stand for a while in the large but sparsely decorated room.
Diagrams, with keyed numbers on the outline of each figure, tell
who 73 of the people shown in the mural are.
   Among the figures is a fat boy with large eyes and a round face,
a self-portrait _ something Rivera often put in his works.
   In the foreground is Spanish conqueror Hernando Cortes. On a
park bench an elderly man dreams of President Antonio Lopez de
Santa Anna, giving American Gen. William Scott the keys to Texas,
New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada and other lands that once
belonged to Mexico.
   Farther back, a former military man, now poor, dreams of the
emperors Maximilian and Carlota. A drunken tramp, next to an old
woman, dreams with his mouth open of miltiary glories, at the side
of Benito Juarez, who holds the reform laws he put into effect as
Mexico's great 19th century president.
   Near the center is dictator Porfirio Diaz and his wife, Carmen
Romero Rubio. Diaz appears full of his fame and power, with a chest
full of ribbons on his uniform.
   At the right, a street vendor offers typical Mexican food to a
middle-class youth and three students, who dream of Gen. Victoriano
Huerta. Official history says Huerta had Francisco I. Madero, who
started the 1910-21 Mexican revolution, killed.
   Rivera completed the 49{ foot by 13 foot painting for the then
fashionable Del Prado in 1948.
   Along with David Alfaro Siqueiros and Jose Clemente Orozco,
Rivera was one of Mexico's three great muralists and one of the
most important Latin American painters in the art world. He died in
1957.
   Among his other best known murals are those in the National
Palace of the Spanish conquest, the Mexican revolution and other
events from the country's history.
   ``The composition is memories of my life, of my childhood and my
youth, from 1895 to 1910,'' Rivera wrote after finishing the mural.
``I do not believe that this work has alarmed or can alarm anyone.
The contemporary figures in the fresco, as figures in dreams, are
not portraits.''
   It was an apparent reference to the phrase, ``God Does Not
Exist,'' a quote attributed to Juarez adviser Ignacio Ramirez and
written on a piece of paper by Ramirez in the mural.
   Eight years after the mural was completed, Rivera changed the
paper to read, ``Conference in the Academy of Letran, the year
1836.'' The phrase refers to the date and place where Ramirez made
his controversial comment.

<HEAD>A Belter Gives Her All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A belter, says singer Nell Carter, is one who
gives his or her all.
   ``You're afraid you might hyperventilate or crack, but you do it
for the excitement of it,'' the Tony award-winning performer said.
``Head singers have to hold everything tight to get the note. I
like belters, people who have that noncontrol but control.''
   Carter is also an Emmy winner who spent six seasons delighting
TV audiences on the sitcom ``Gimme a Break.'' She was interviewed
while in New York for a nine-day engagement at the Village Gate.
   ``I have a Las Vegas show,'' she said. ``One critic said on a
scale of one to 10 we were 11. I'm not doing that show.''
   The dinner show in Las Vegas, she said, is easy. ``They like
anything as long as it's recognizable. You get a chance to really
wail a song, do something with a great arrangement. The late show,
you have a lot of drunks. You sing whatever they want to hear.
Torch songs seem to go over.''
   She's choosing from among 60 songs in her New York show, which
opened April 15. ``I wanted to sing Harold Arlen this time and some
country songs and I'm learning `One of Us Was Wrong' from 1899 and
some Sophie Tucker songs. If you were to put this show on canvas,
it would be very abstract.''
   Carter won a Tony for best featured actress in a musical for her
performance in ``Ain't Misbehavin','' the revue of Fats Waller
songs which opened on Broadway in 1978, and she will be in the
revival this August. She sings Waller's ``Keepin' Out of Mischief
Now'' in her show.
   She left ``Ain't Misbehavin''' after nine months to have her
tonsils out, sang Gershwin at the King Cole Room of the St. Regis
Hotel, was in ``Black Broadway'' at Town Hall and then returned to
``Ain't Misbehavin''' in San Francisco and Los Angeles to fulfill
her contract.
   ``They've always cast the part to look like me,'' she said.
``People will say they saw me in St. Louis.''
   In those days, and until about four years ago, Carter said she
did not appreciate her talent.
   ``I was hanging out with the wrong crowd, participating in
things I wouldn't choose to do now,'' she said. ``Now when I'm on
stage I know why they're applauding. I know what I just said. I
remember what I did last night.
   ``I'm not saying I was a loose woman. I did have my episode with
drugs.
   ``I was able to have a good career while I was doing terrible
things to myself. I don't see why I did not die. I think it must
have been a death wish for me to even be involved in the things I
was doing. Thank God I didn't die. Now I don't want to. It's a
different world for me now.''
   Growing up in Birmingham, Ala., Carter listened to her mother's
recordings of Dinah Washington and B.B. King, and her brother's
Elvis Presley records. She liked Doris Day, the Andrews Sisters,
Johnny Mathis, and mentions Cleo Laine and Barbra Streisand as
singers she admires.
   ``If Liza Minnelli wants to sing with me, I won't turn her down
_ I'll give the poor kid a break,'' she said. ``I would love to
sing with Joe Cocker. His soul is so bare.''
   However, Carter would like to have been an opera singer. ``When
I was growing up, it was not something you aspired to. I was a
weirdo to want to be in show business. Most kids wanted to be
teachers or nurses.''
   Carter has a daughter from a previous union and has been married
for six years. ``I'm not going to tell you anything about him,''
she said. ``He is a very private person, a very nice man. His
family does not understand publicity. They don't like it.''
   She collects crystal and antique silver picture frames and is an
avid reader, favoring biographies and history.
   She hopes to work with the producers of ``Gimme a Break'' again
and wants to get back on Broadway.

<HEAD>Lagging Utilities Worry Market Analysts</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many analysts who are still skittish about the
investment outlook these days point to the uninspired behavior
lately of utility stocks.
   Last week, while the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials briefly
touched a new high since the October crash, Dow Jones's average of
15 utilities lagged behind.
   When it dipped below 170 late last week, the utility average
stood more than 10 percent below where it was on Jan. 29.
   The performance of utility stocks as a group is ``a good gauge
of the interest-rate environment,'' said Anthony Sorrentino, an
analyst at Standard & Poor's Corp., in the firm's weekly advisory
publication The Outlook.
   It is also, he added, ``often a leading indicator of stock
prices in general.''
   Utility stocks tend to respond quickly to changing expectations
about the interest-rate outlook for a couple of well-known reasons.
   For one thing, since utilities are heavy borrowers to finance
their capital needs, interest rates are an important element of
their costs of doing business.
   Besides that, most investors in utility stocks are very
yield-conscious, and thus tend to push the stocks' prices up and
down in close alignment with fluctuations in the bond market.
   In the great bull market, the Dow Jones utility average was the
first of the widely recognized indicators to peak out, at 227.83 on
Jan. 22, 1987.
   Any investors who used that as a ``sell signal'' missed out on
the dramatic gains in industrial stock prices that continued
through August of last year.
   But they also would have been safely out of the way when
interest rates surged upward last spring, and when stock prices
crashed in the fall.
   The recent weakness in utilities, Sorrentino says, ``is reason
for concern, as it suggests that investors believe interest rates
are headed higher.''
   Of course, interest-rate expectations can change, sometimes very
quickly. The Merrill Lynch Market Letter maintains that ``utility
stocks generally appear to be oversold. We think they could do
better in the months ahead.''
   Even if utilities do not come on strong, argues Greg Smith, an
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, they are not an infallible
guide to what the rest of the market might do.
   Utilities fell in 1977, he points out, and then industrial
stocks rose for the next three years.
   ``The poor performance of the utility averages signals bad
problems for the overall stock market to many investors, especially
since the divergence developed prior to the crash of last year,''
he said.
   ``They're waiting for another shoe to fall. I think it's a
mistake to look for a matching shoe.
   ``To mix metaphors a little, I would point out that the same
lightning rarely strikes the stock market twice in a row.''
   In Smith's view, the market's early-1988 rally drew its force
not from value considerations based on such things as interest
rates, but rather from strong corporate earnings.
   ``Utilities won't work, but not because another crisis is in the
making,'' he said. ``They won't work because this isn't a
valuation-driven market anymore.
   ``The bottom in interest rates is very well established now. As
a result, the industrial averages, the utility averages and
interest rates are no longer going to move together.
   ``This is a more advanced stage of the stock market cycle. And I
don't know of any reliable tool to predict its duration.''

<HEAD>Differences Among Democrats Highlighted as N.Y. Primary Nears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson would freeze Pentagon spending
and raise taxes on the rich. Michael Dukakis would shoot down the
Midgetman missile and hire more tax collectors. Albert Gore Jr.
would consider a tax on luxuries, but supports some weapons his
rivals oppose.
   The budget and defense policy are not the only areas in which
the three surviving challengers for the Democratic presidential
nomination differ. Among the others: abortion, education, taxes and
the Middle East.
   The Middle East, particularly, has been a topic of considerable
concern as the candidates head into Tuesday's New York primary. In
1984, Jews cast 23 percent of the votes in that contest.
   Jackson, the civil rights activist, has taken the most
consistently liberal stands on foreign and domestic issues, and has
offered more specifics on how he would grapple with the federal
budget deficit.
   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, also has embraced many
liberal social ideas, including universal health insurance, but has
suggested that taxpayer costs can be minimized by forging
partnerships with the private sector.
   Gore has staked out the more conservative stances on military
and foreign policy issues, and has been the most outspoken
supporter of Israel and opponent of a Palestinian state. He has
gained expertise on arms control during 12 years in Congress, where
he has compiled a liberal voting record on labor, environment and
health issues.
   Here is a look at where the Democrats stand on key issues:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAXES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Jackson would make the wealthiest 600,000 taxpayers pay at a
rate of 38.5 percent instead of the current top of 28 to 33
percent. He also would boost corporate taxes back to 1970s levels.
   Dukakis says, ``No serious candidate for president can rule out
the possibility of new taxes.'' But he says the first step is to
hire more Internal Revenue Service agents and ``collect every
dollar we can of that $110 billion that's not being paid today.''
   Gore has favored a top marginal tax rate of 33 percent for those
making more than $200,000 a year. ``If we are driven as a last
resort to new taxes, I will fight to ensure that we turn first to
those who can afford it,'' says Gore, who has suggested raising
nearly $1 billion with a 5 percent tax on luxury items, $10 billion
by keeping corporate taxes at their current level and $5 billion by

   Jackson claims he could reduce the deficit by $100 billion
annually by 1993 by freezing Pentagon spending for five years and
by his tax increases on the wealthy. But he has also proposed major
increases in social spending.
   Dukakis would scale back Star Wars research and save $50 billion
by scrapping the Midgetman missile. He says he would trim federal
programs and squeeze out waste, but cautions, ``We're not going to
get major cuts out of the domestic side of the budget. It's been
savaged over the past seven years.''
   Gore says he would ``convene a summit of our nation's leaders on
economics to forge a national consensus on how best to tackle our
budget deficit.'' He proposed eliminating subsidies for junk mail,
cutting corporate farm subsidies and eliminating ``the $40 billion
of unnecessary medical diagnostics'' that the government pays for
each year.

   All three candidates oppose the Strategic Defense Initiative.
Dukakis and Gore would scale back basic research in the field to

   Jackson proposes saving $40 billion by not building two new
aircraft carrier task forces, and ``tens of billions of dollars''
by negotiating further arms reductions with the Soviets. He opposes
building the Midgetman missile, the Stealth bomber, the Trident D-5
missile, or any more MX missiles.
   Dukakis opposes the Midgetman. He contends that until the United
States and Soviets can agree on reducing conventional forces,
savings on strategic weapons must be invested in strengthening U.S.
non-nuclear forces.
   Gore is a stalwart supporter of the single-warhead Midgetman
missile, and helped win congressional approval for it in exchange
for limiting production of the multi-warhead MX missile to 50.
   Like his rivals, Gore opposed military aid to the Contras, but
has voted in the past for humanitarian aid for the Nicaraguan
rebels. Gore fought Reagan administration efforts to revive the B-1
bomber, then voted to limit production to 100.

leader Yasser Arafat, now says he would not do it again. But he
calls current U.S. policy ``fatally flawed'' and favors ``an
international conference on the Middle East involving all the
parties concerned, including the chosen representatives of the
Palestinian people.''
   Dukakis has said Arab leaders' refusal to negotiate with Israel
is to blame for the current Palestinian strife; he says Israel
should not be forced to relinquish all the land won in the 1967 war.

   Dukakis has promised to make universal health insurance a basic

bureaucratic program'' or spending ``a dime'' by requiring most
employers to offer health insurance as a fringe benefit.
   Massachusetts has just become the first state to move in that
direction, and similar legislation is already pending in Congress.
The Massachusetts plan, which exempts firms with five or fewer
employees, will cost that state $550 million or more through 1992.
   Gore has been instrumental in legislation creating an organ

Jackson also has called for a national minimum welfare benefit,

<TEXT>
   Six months after the stock market crash of 1987,
a sense of shock and confusion still pervades Wall Street.
   Although stock prices have recovered some of their losses of
Black Monday Oct. 19, the crash weighs heavily on just about any
financial decision or economic forecast these days.
   Despite the economy's resilience, the $500 billion collapse has
severely dampened the enthusiasm of both professional money
managers and the American public for stock investments.
   And its aftershocks remain very much in evidence, as they were
Thursday when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 101.46
points in response to a government report showing an unexpected
widening of the nation's trade deficit.
   Trading volume in all the major stock markets so far in 1988 is
running behind the pace it set a year ago. Through early April,
volume was down 4.1 percent at the New York Stock Stock Exchange,
and 16.7 percent in the over-the-counter market.
   The NYSE decline would be much bigger were it not for heavy
trading in stocks of companies targeted for takeovers and
high-yielding issues with impending dividend payments.
   Veteran observers caution that it will take still more time to
assess the crash's ultimate effects. Even with the advantage of
hindsight, it is clear that the crash was many different things to
many different people.
   At one extreme, some analysts will tell you Black Monday was
just the first stage of a severe bear market that will usher in a
recession _ or worse _ in the nation's economy.
   At the other, some insist it was nothing more than an
exaggerated ``correction'' that drove excessive enthusiasm out of
the marketplace, setting the stage for new rallies in stock prices
and helping to prevent a recession that might otherwise be in
progress today.
   While there isn't yet, and may never be, a widely accepted
consensus on what precisely caused the crash, a good many analysts
have come to agree that it stemmed in large measure from a change
in the credit policies of the Federal Reserve and central banks of
other prominent industrialized countries.
   In this view, these powerful institutions created a financial
boom in the mid-1980s by fostering the growth of a vast pool of
``liquidity,'' or money looking for a place to go to work.
   Starting in early 1987, they began to shut off the flow,
prompted by fears of inflation and a long decline in the value of
the dollar against leading foreign currencies.
   Economist Albert Wojnilower, a managing director at the Wall
Street firm of First Boston Corp., said in a recent appraisal:
   ``As 1987 wore on, it became more and more evident _ so that
ultimately even the stock markets had to accept the fact _ that
U.S. monetary policy was on a course leading to an eventual
recession.''
   That recession didn't arrive on schedule, Wojnilower added,
because restrictive monetary policies were immediately abandoned in
the aftermath of the crash.
   He says a business slump is still in the offing, probably in
1989, ``but it need not be severe. The end of the world is not at
hand.''
   With all the studies, investigations and reports by blue-ribbon
panels that have been done since the crash, major steps to reform
and fortify the markets have come slowly or not at all.
   The presidential commission headed by Nicholas F. Brady of
Dillon, Read & Co. promoted the idea that the nation's financial
markets _ the stock market and the futures market where contracts
on stock indexes are traded _ could be set up and managed as ``one
market.''
   The Brady plan called for coordinating the regulation of the
markets and installing ``circuit breakers'' that would prevent a
crisis from erupting in one market and spreading to the other.
   Those who blame computer-driven program trading for contributing
to the October debacle point out that such techniques are triggered
by discrepancies in the prices of stock index futures and the
underlying equities. But the two markets have long operated under
significantly different rules and have resisted regulatory changes
that might threaten their franchises.
   Brady's super-regulatory proposal has been bogged down by
haggling over who would be the super regulator. Although the Brady
panel favored the Federal Reserve, the central bank appears
reluctant to take on the job.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is more willing to fill
the void, but regulators of the futures markets have resisted the
idea of turning over a measure of their authority to the SEC.
   To help sort out the competing interests, the White House has
appointed yet another committee, comprised of representatives of
the various regulatory agencies, which is expected to report still
more recommendations later this spring.
   The New York Stock Exchange has adopted one notable new rule _ a
constraint known as a ``collar'' that bars use of its main
order-processing system for one method of program trading should
the Dow Jones industrial average rise or fall on any given day by
as much as 50 points.
   In addition, the NYSE has announced a sharp increase in the
amount of capital that must be held by its specialists, the brokers
who act as meeting points for buy and sell orders on the trading
floor.
   Separately, the National Association of Securities Dealers has
moved to try to strengthen the over-the-counter market for unlisted
stocks, which it oversees.
   By summer, NASD procedures are scheduled to be in effect to
decrease the market's dependency on voice communication by
telephone, and to punish dealers who back away from fast-moving
markets without a special-case excuse.
   The aim of such measures is to increase the markets' strength
and accessibility in times of stress, so that the machinery doesn't
break down altogether and turn an already bad situation into a
disaster.
   Still, many regulators and securities industry officials say it
would be pointless and quite possibly dangerous to attempt to
legislate away the threat of any future crashes.
   If the Fed were standing by with its enormous resources as a
buyer of last resort in times of crisis, presumably the stock
market would be less susceptible, if not immune, to panics. But
something like that would also cost the market what Joseph
Hardiman, president of the NASD, calls ``the discipline of risk.''
   If investors believed they could rely indefinitely on an
institution like the Fed to support the market, they might well go
on a speculative binge that would create stresses not even the Fed
could deal with.
   Under this line of reasoning, the quickest way to set the stage
for the next market crash would be to create a system to assure
everybody that it could never happen again.

<HEAD>Magnum Finale Promises No Reunions</HEAD>

   In what was billed as the series ender,
``Magnum, P.I.'' concluded last season with our hero getting gunned
down and walking off into an ethereal landscape that looked
suspiciously like heaven.
   But star Tom Selleck agreed to do 13 more episodes, and Magnum's
walk through the clouds was explained as an out-of-body experience.
   On Sunday, ``Magnum'' ends its eight-year run on CBS with a
special two-hour episode. This time, there will be no catch, no
reincarnation, no next season.
   ``After this episode, the audience would have a very hard time
figuring out how we could ever do a reunion show,'' said Selleck on
a break in filming. ``There's a finality to this show. We wanted to
do something that would threaten the franchise.''
   Chas. Floyd Johnson, the show's co-executive producer, wouldn't
give away the ending, but did say the finale will answer some
questions.
   ``It will touch on the issue of whether Jonathan is really Robin
Masters. It will deal with every one of the characters in at least
looking at what their lives will be like after `Magnum,''' he said.
   Selleck plays Thomas Magnum, a former Naval intelligence officer
turned private eye, perpetually on the brink of poverty but living
in high style, thanks to the largesse of never-seen wealthy mystery
writer Robin Masters.
   John Hillerman plays Jonathan Quayle Higgins, the British major
domo who runs Masters' estate and antagonizes Magnum, even as he
comes to his aid. Larry Manetti and Roger E. Mosley are Magnum's
Vietnam buddies, Rick and T.C.
   Set against the exotic backdrop of the islands, ``Magnum, P.I.''
plots ran from silly to deadly serious. The show made Selleck an
international star.
   In its early years, the CBS series consistently landed in the
top 10 of the Nielsen ratings. But in 1984, it was scheduled
against NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and its ratings sagged. After some
juggling by CBS, ``Magnum'' moved to Wednesday night and regained
much of its audience.
   ``It's important to me that we go out while people still want
us,'' Selleck said. ``This show is too special to me to let it die
a natural death. No matter what the rest of my films did, or even
the success of `Three Men and a Baby,' it all came to me by way of
this show, and I've always tried to take care of `Magnum.'''
   ``Three Men and a Baby'' marked Selleck's first major screen
success after several starring roles.
   Selleck's reputation as an actor was initially overshadowed by
his image as a pin-up. But he eventually won an Emmy award as best
actor in a dramatic series. Working in Hawaii, he said, protected
him from the buffeting of sudden fame.
   ``I've been lucky over here, I've been sheltered from a lot of
the stuff tht goes on on the mainland,'' Selleck said. ``It's great
to be chosen favorite this or that, but a whole lot of baggage goes
with all those titles. And then what happens when you're not at the
top of the opinion polls? That's why, even though I appreciate it,
I try not to buy into that stuff and being in Hawaii has just made
that easier. Plus, I love it here.''
   He said he will maintain his ties to the islands. He has formed
a production company with Johnson and ``Magnum'' supervising
producer Chris Abbott and hopes to produce a new series here,
though without Selleck as star.
   Selleck's dual role of producing and starring in ``Magnum'' the
past two years resulting in an ``unnatural existence,'' he said.
   ``It just takes up too large a part of my life _ which is all my
waking hours _ and in the long run I just don't think that's very
healthy, physically or emotionally,'' said Selleck, who last year
married actress Jillie Mack.
   He planned to begin working in July on ``Her Alibi,'' a romantic
comedy directed by Bruce Beresford. Until then, he said, he'll
relax.
   ``I asked for the time off because I just don't know how I'm
gonna feel after Magnum ends,'' Selleck said. ``I think I really
need to take the time off to just see what happens. That's why I
really have very few kinds of goals or direction right now.''
   Saying goodbye won't be easy, Selleck said.
   ``There's a huge part of me that would love `Magnum' to go on
forever,'' he said. ``I really do believe that it'll be about the
best job I'll ever have.''

   The government's report that the monthly U.S.
trade deficit widened by more than 11 percent to $13.8 billion in
February sparked a nosedive in stock prices and the dollar.
   The gap between the nation's imports and exports expanded by

deficit last October, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.

   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more

the government announced a higher-than-expected trade deficit in
February.
   The Dow skidded 101.46 points to 2,005.64, a 4.8 percent
decline, making Thursday's plunge the year's second worst drop
after a 140.58-point slide on Jan. 8.
   Most traders had convinced themselves the imbalance between
imports and exports would be less than $12 billion, and were
disappointed at the actual results.

   A restriction on computerized stock trading that

   Under the collar rule, traders are banned from using the New
York Stock Exchange's automated order system to execute
index-arbitrage program trades when the Dow average moves up or
down 50 points from the previous close.

Wednesday.
   Oil prices jumped to new highs, while gold also moved higher.

   Oil prices are benefiting from the stock market
drop and from rumors about the scope of OPEC's planned meeting with
non-cartel exporters, market watchers say.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May-delivery price for
West Texas Intermediate crude closed up 18 cents per barrel to
$18.30 on Thursday. It was the highest since a Dec. 11 close at
$18.31.
   Refined products traded on the exchange were mixed. Heating oil
rose 0.49 cent per gallon to 49.51 cents, and unleaded gasoline
fell .06 cent a gallon to 52.36 cents.
   ``We had a strong day here today, but it was nervous
throughout,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of Elders
Futures Inc., an energy futures trading concern in New York.
   Traders said some buying in the oil market came from investors
who dumped stocks and were seeking havens for their money. The
stock market tumbled after the Commerce Department reported a
widening trade deficit in February.
   Others said the market was driven partly by rumors that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was expanding its
list of non-cartel guests at a previously announced meeting on
April 23.
   News of OPEC's plans to enlist outside support for boosting oil
prices has been the key reason for a market rally over the past few
days.

<HEAD>Bank of NY Stockholders Back Bid for Irving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the backing of its own shareholders
secured, Bank of New York Co. now turns its full attention to
convincing Irving Bank Corp. stockowners that its hostile $1
billion-plus takeover bid is a good deal.
   Chairman J. Carter Bacot said he had met privately with some of
Irving's biggest stockholders, and that bank officials would
continue soliciting others via telephone and mail until Irving's
annual meeting next Thursday.
   ``It's a unique fit,'' Bacot told Bank of New York shareholders
at their yearly gathering Thursday. ``Virtually all their
businesses blend well into our's. We believe no other merger could
make as much sense ...''
   Bank of New York is offering $15 in cash and 1.575 of its common
shares for each of Irving's roughly 18.1 million common shares
outstanding, a proposal Irving has rejected as inadequate during
their extended and bitter takeover fight.
   At Bank of New York's annual meeting, Bacot said preliminary
tabulations showed shareholders solidly backed the company by
granting it permission to issue as many additional common shares
and convertible securities as needed to complete the Irving
acquisition.
   The exact result of the vote on the stock question is to be
released April 22.
   Bank of New York, which holds a 4.9 percent stake in Irving, is
seeking to gain control of that company's board of directors and
has nominated a slate of 16 nominees.
   Analysts said they could not predict whether Bank of New York
could succeed.
   ``I can't take bets on that one ... though I'm sure Bank of New
York is feeling very bullish'' following Thursday's meeting, said
Rosemarie Conforte, a banking analyst with Moody's Investors
Service.
   ``I think that's a very close call,'' said Stephen Berman, a
banking analyst with County Securities USA. ``I think they (Irving
shareholders) may be persuaded, but it's a coin flip almost.''
   Many analysts agree that a combination of the two would not be
such a bad idea because both New York banks operate in a similar
marketplace and offer similar services such as securities
processing.
   But Irving repeatedly has spurned the company's takeover offers,
which began about seven months ago, maintaining it wants to remain
independent.
   Irving representatives had urged Bank of New York shareholders
Thursday to ask management to abandon all efforts to merge the two
banks. Irving argued that combining the two would dilute the value
of Bank of New York stock, hurting earnings and dividends.
   ``We are convinced that the cost of integrating the two
companies would create a further drain on earnings and that any
benefits of combining the two firms would not be recognized for
three to five years,'' said Robert A. Falise, an executive vice
president for legal affairs at Irving.
   But Bacot maintained dilution was not a problem. He also said a
takeover would not reduce Bank of New York's dividends, which have
increased annually for the past 11 years.
   Bank of New York began its current tender offer last month after
receiving regulatory approval.
   Both the Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Banking
Board said a merger wouldn't hurt competition in the nation's
biggest financial center. Irving has asked the federal courts to
overturn the Fed's decision.
   Irving has taken a number of other steps to tryto defeat Bank of
New York's advances, including instituting an anti-takeover
``poison pill'' defense that is designed to make any hostile buyout
prohibitively expensive.
   Hostile takeover efforts are rare in the banking industry. A
merger between New York Bank and Irving would create one of the
nation's 15 largest bank holding companies with combined assets of
more than $40 billion.
   Bank of New York began its takeover efforts six months ago with
an offer of $1.4 billion, or $80 in cash and securities. It revised
the offer to $68 in cash and securities following October's stock
market crash, and lowered the bid a second time in late January.

<HEAD>Bigger Trade Deficit Knocks $100 Billion Out Of Wall Street</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be led with early market activity. Stands for PM-Economy

   Investors remain cautious about the nation's
economic outlook today after a report of a rising U.S. trade gap
knocked them for a loop and sparked a $100 billion selloff on Wall
Street.
   The Commerce Department's report Thursday that the trade deficit
rose to $13.8 billion in February sparked a 101.46-point decline to
2,005.64 in the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks.
   In foreign exchange, the dollar fell about 2 percent against the
Japanese yen and West German mark despite central bank purchases
aimed at bolstering the dollar, and bond market interest rates rose
to their highest levels since January.
   The trade report raised concerns that the dollar would remain
under pressure despite a months-old agreement by major
industrialized nations to support it. That agreement was reaffirmed
Wednesday by the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Canada and Italy at a meeting in Washington.
   Investors worried that the Federal Reserve might try to support
the falling currency by pushing interest rates higher.
   On Wall Street, declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones
nearly 11 to 1 in the worst day since the widely-followed Dow Jones
average fell 140.58 points on Jan. 8.
   The Dow industrials had climbed nearly 130 points from April 5
through Tuesday, largely on anticipation that February's trade news
would be favorable.
   The value of U.S. stocks fell by $99.7 billion in Thursday's
plunge, according to a 5,000-stock index measured by Wilshire
Associates of Santa Monica, Calif.
   In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury Department's
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond jumped to roughly 8.86 percent
Thursday, the highest since January, from 8.73 percent late
Wednesday.
   The trade report also battered major foreign markets. In London,
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 1.3 percent
on Thursday.
   In Tokyo, stocks fell sharply at today's opening but later
recovered much of their losses. The key Nikkei Stock Average of 225
issues, down more than 250 points at one time, finished the morning
session at 26,967.83, down 143.52 from Thursday's record close.
   The dollar opened a sharp 1.7 percent lower against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo but later stabilized on reports of heavy dollar-buying
by the Bank of Japan.
   Some economists called the markets' fears an overreaction.
   ``The quality (precision) of the numbers obviously leaves
something to be desired,'' said Raymond Worseck, economist at A.G.
Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   The trade report indicated consumers were continuing to spend
strongly, sucking up imports, Worseck said.
   The trade deficit was the highest since the record gap of $17.6
billion in October. It was up from January's $12.4 billion gap, but
was down from a deficit of $14.4 billion in February 1987.
   ``It's just one of those glitches that keep the financial
markets interesting. The trend is still for improvement in the
trade deficit,'' said James Solloway, director of economic research
at Argus Research Corp. in St. Louis.

   Rebuilding confidence in the stock market after
the crash last October is proving to be an elusive and
time-consuming mission.
   The market's latest bid to rally collapsed on Thursday when the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, the best known measure of
market trends, fell 101.46 points to 2,005.64, for its
fifth-largest loss ever.
   From April 5 through Tuesday of this week, the Dow industrials
had climbed nearly 130 points, largely on anticipation of a
continuing flow of favorable news on the nation's trade balance and
the outlook for the dollar in foreign exchange.
   But the word from the Commerce Department on Thursday morning
was that the trade deficit widened in February, with imports
exceeding exports by $13.83 against $12.44 billion the month before.
   In effect, that wiped out with a single stroke the basic premise
behind the recent rally.
   Stock market analysts said persistent strength in imports, in
particular, raised fears that the Federal Reserve soon might feel
the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to
support the dollar.
   ``You got a nasty bit of news,'' said Larry Wachtel at
Prudential-Bache Securities. ``The market is saying that the
economy is too strong.''
   Wachtel also said the withdrawal from the market since last fall
of many investors frightened away by the crash had left stocks in a
fragile position, vulnerable to volatile swings.
   ``It's really a day-trader's market,'' he said. ``When we were
rallying, there wasn't a lot of volume.
   ``And when the market started to come down, there were no
buffers on the downside _ no small investors, no pension managers,
no foreign investors.''
   That leaves Wall Street in a paradoxical plight. Investors large
and small seem inclined to stay clear of the stock market until it
shows signs of greater stability.
   But it looks as though those investors' presence may be needed
if that stability is going to be attained.
   In the meantime, market analysts and professional money managers
still are groping for some indication of where the market ought to
settle out, and of what level of stock prices ``makes sense'' in
the aftermath of the crash.
   As Jay Donnaruma, an analyst at First Albany Corp. in Albany,
N.Y., put it in his latest market commentary: ``In the current
environment, all the normal road signs that usually provide one
with direction appear to have been stolen by vandals.''

<HEAD>Dow Drop Tests 50-Point Collar, Revives Debate Over Program
Trading Limit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first major test of Wall Street's
computerized trading ``collar'' in braking a big fall in stock
prices is getting mixed reviews, with some calling the limit
helpful and others saying it may have worsened the drop.
   ``The collar has got some holes in it,'' Leigh Stevens, a
PaineWebber Inc. strategist, said Thursday after the Dow Jones
average tumbled 101.46 points, its fifth-worst daily decline ever.
   The slide represented more than double the 50-point swing
necessary to activate the collar, which when triggered bans the use
of New York Stock Exchange computers for so-called index arbitrage
program trading for the rest of the day.
   The drop marked the first time since the NYSE imposed the
restriction on Feb. 4 that a decline activated the 50-point
trigger. The collar took effect once before on April 6 when the
average rose 64.16 points.
   ``At the present time, it's not working,'' Peter J. DaPuzzo,
head of retail equities at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said as
selling swept the market even once the collar took effect at about
1:55 p.m. EDT.
   The limit is part of an NYSE effort to restore stability to a
market still suffering after-effects of the epic crash nearly six
months ago. Some crash studies have suggested program trading
aggravated the October plunge, and the Big Board has expressed
concern that the practice is undermining investor and regulator
confidence.
   ``It's really premature to assess whether the collar works,''
said NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin. ``It wasn't designed to stop
the Dow average from moving. We only have evidence of two days.
When we get more data, we'll analyze it. If it's necessary to take
further action, we might.''
   Some traders said they believed the collar lessened the impact
of what would have been a heavy selloff under any circumstances.
Investors rushed to dump stocks largely because of economic worries
linked to the government's report of a wider-than-expected trade
deficit for February.
   But others said the braking effects of the collar were
overwhelmed by big brokerage houses that executed sell orders
manually or used forms of program trading not covered by the
restraint. A few traders said they believed the collar actually
worsened the drop because it only left sellers in the market.
   ``Once this thing goes below 50, nobody shows up to do any
buying,'' said Joseph Barthel, a technical strategist at Butcher &
Singer Inc.
   In index arbitrage, brokers use computers to buy or sell massive
amounts of stocks in New York and the equivalent stock-index
futures in Chicago, in order to profit from price disparities.
   Although many brokerages have applauded the NYSE's limit on the
technique, others have been critical because they say it severs an
important relationship between the stock and futures markets.
   Studies of the stock crash have concluded the relationship
between financial markets was an important element in the October
crash. A presidential panel's crash study, for example, suggested
that a system of ``circuit breakers'' applying simultaneously to
all markets trading stocks or stock-index futures would help
prevent another crisis.
   ``I have a couple of problems with the whole collar concept,''
said Howard Schneider, a futures-market expert and securities
lawyer who is critical of the NYSE's post-crash strategy.
   ``Clearly, you can't disconnect the stock exchange from the
futures market. They're all one big ball of wax,'' Schneider said.
``If you have only the stock exchange with a circuit breaker, it
doesn't do a damn thing.''

   A new kind of corn bread that combines
down-home color and flavor with a firmness that stands up to
slicing could help shrink the nation's corn surplus if it goes over
well with consumers, government researchers say.
   This is not old-fashioned corn bread that crumbles into the ham
and beans. This firm new loaf _ made from flour that's half wheat
and half finely ground corn _ can be sliced, buttered, toasted and
used for sandwiches.
   ``It gives people a new bread product, and it could enable
farmers to sell more of their corn at a higher price,'' said U.S.
Department of Agriculture food technologist Kathleen Warner.
   The bread was developed at the USDA laboratory in Peoria. Warner
said the goal was to develop a bread that used as much corn flour
as possible ``so it would make a big impact on using up surplus
corn supplies.''
   As it turned out, the ideal flour formulation was half corn and
half wheat, with extra wheat gluten to improve its structure. The
dough is leavened with yeast.
   Traditional corn bread is made mainly from coarser cornmeal and
baking powder.
   Warner said the new corn bread resembles a home-baked or
specialty bakery loaf rather than typical supermarket sandwich
bread. But she said wholesale bakers could modify the formula ``to
make it lighter and fluffier'' if that is the kind of loaf their
customers want.
   ``The next step is to encourage industry to try this and find a
market for it,'' Warner said.
   The $16 billion-a-year wholesale bread- and cake-baking industry
uses about 100 million pounds of flour annually, according to
Gordon Davidson, editor of the Milling and Baking News.
   ``I can't even predict what consumer interest would be'' for the
new corn bread, said William Hoover, president of the American
Institute of Baking. ``I like corn bread, so if it has that flavor
it might appeal to some of the public.''
   Hoover noted that sales of a new product usually reflect the
amount of money spent on marketing and advertising. Bakers would
have to believe the new corn bread is ``delightfully good tasting''
to make a major investment in promoting it, he said.
   During the 1970s, Purity Baking Co. of Decatur marketed a
product called Country Corn Bread, using a smaller percentage of
corn flour. President Chuck Webb said that version had a rich
golden color, and because corn flour holds moisture well it also
stayed fresh longer.
   ``It is just one of those items that was very successful at the
time, but tastes change and it eventually was replaced,'' said Webb.
   ``People today are searching for new varieties'' and this could
be a good time to offer a new kind of corn bread, he said.
   A popular new corn bread also could help the nation's dry
millers, who use about 2 percent of the U.S. corn crop, said Betsy
Faga, president of the American Corn Millers Federation.
   ``The industry certainly is looking for new uses for dry milled
corn _ every possible outlet,'' said Faga. ``This certainly could
be a new one for them.''

<HEAD>Shareholders Stall De Bendetti's Bid For Societe Generale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Societe Generale de Belgique SA
shareholders have dealt Carlo De Benedetti a setback in his
attempted takeover of the giant holding company, but the Italian
financier still wields some clout over the enterprise.
   At a 12-hour special shareholders meeting on Thursday,
shareholders spurned the bid by De Benedetti and two allies to win
seats on the Societe Generale board of directors. The trio got
votes from only 44.5 percent of the shares registered, and needed
51 percent to win election to the board.
   But because he commands a huge block of shares, De Benedetti
retains much clout within the company and may win yet a board seat.
   ``Today's votes will not be for the long term,'' De Benedetti
told the more than 1,150 shareholders before the vote, which was
taken at a meeting held in a tent next to Societe Generale's head
office.
   ``In one week, one month, six months or one year, we will play a
major role in Societe Generale. Without me...no stable management
of Societe Generale is possible.''
   Management of Societe Generale, Belgium's biggest holding
company, was relieved after the marathon meeting.
   ``We fought it out. There was a winner and a loser,'' said
Director Etienne Davignon.
   Shareholders added 12 members _ all rivals of De Benedetti _ to
the board of directors with a majority of 55 percent of the vote.
The previous board had 11 directors.
   Right up through the start of the meeting, De Benedetti had met
with his rivals to seek a compromise. But the talks failed when De
Benedetti continued insisting on control over day-to-day management
of the venerable, 166-year-old Societe Generale, which has stakes
in some 1,300 companies worldwide.
   De Benedetti, who sparked the heated takeover battle for Societe
Generale three months ago, had sought election along with two
allies, including Andre Leysen, chairman of Belgium's Gevaert NV.
   Societe Generale nominated the remaining 12 candidates, allies
of France's Cie. Financiere de Suez and Groupe AG. The two
companies, heading an alliance of smaller Belgian, French,
Luxembourg and Swiss interests, led the fight against De Benedetti.
   The vote indicated how many shares each faction controls.
   Under Belgian law, shareholders are not required to disclose the
amount of their holdings, leaving only speculation over which group
holds a majority.
   De Benedetti, who spent some $1.7 billion to raise his Societe
Generale holdings, claims he and his allies control 48 percent of
the company.
   Suez and Groupe AG say they hold 50.7 percent, after spending
about $850 million to beef up their stake.
   At Thursday's meeting, a De Benedetti aide made an official
statement complaining about ``irregularities'' in the voting,
including extensive delays in tallying the vote caused by computer
malfunctions.
   Analysts said the protest may have been made to allow De
Benedetti to protest the vote in court, although there were no
immediate threats of legal action.
   De Benedetti also is fighting a legal battle over Societe
Generale's issuance of 12 million new shares in an attempt to
dilute his stake. The stock was issued Jan. 18, the day De
Benedetti launched his hostile bid.
   De Benedetti, the chairman of Italy's Olivetti SpA, wants to
turn Societe Generale _ which has interests in mining, engineering,
manufacturing, chemicals, banking, and other areas _ into a
pan-European holding company before 1992. That year, the European
Economic Community is to remove regulatory curbs on the free
movement of goods and services.

<HEAD>Federal Inquiry Will Examine Texas Air's Complex Financial
Structure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The squad of federal investigators probing Texas
Air Corp. faces the task of unraveling a labyrinthine corporate
structure adopted by the nation's biggest airline company.
   The Department of Transportation on Wednesday charged 25
accountants, auditors, economists and financial analysts with
delving into a complex structure that has steeped the ailing
carrier in controversy and made it the target of labor union
hostility.
   Houston-based Texas Air, which commands 20 percent of the U.S.
market, is the parent company of major carriers Eastern Airlines
and Continental Airlines.
   A key figure in the government's probe will be Texas Air
Chairman Frank Lorenzo who aggressively built the company from a
small intrastate carrier into an airline empire. Unions and other
critics have accused Lorenzo of siphoning off Eastern and
Continental assets into the parent company.
   Recent Texas Air filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission indicated that both Eastern and Continental ``are under
substantial, increasing financial pressure,'' Transportation
Secretary Jim Burnley said in announcing the investigation.
   Documents indicate, for example, that Texas Air's cash reserves
were drained last year at a rate of more than $1 million a day, and
that the company has around $7 billion in liabilities related to
leasing planes.
   The government's financial probe will examine the corporation's
management and business practices and the relationships between the
parent, Eastern and Continental, said DOT General Counsel B. Wayne
Vance. The department's deputy general counsel, Rosalind Knapp,
will head the investigation.
   While Texas Air controls Eastern and Continental, Houston-based
Continental itself is the parent of other Lorenzo acquisitions:
Frontier Airlines, People Express and New York Air. All three have
ceased operating _ Frontier is in bankruptcy _ but Continental has
absorbed their assets.
   Texas Air also operates several commuter carriers: Rocky
Mountain Airways, Britt Airways, Bar Harbor Airlines and
Provincetown-Boston Airlines.
   Together, the Texas Air carriers have a huge debt of around $5.4
billion, but Lorenzo has set up a corporate structure that
insulates the parent itself from most of the burden. The parent
company sustained record losses of $466 million last year.
   The Wall Street Journal recently likened the complex corporate
architecture to a house of many rooms: Every room has a paying
tenant and a bank can foreclose on an individual room, but not on
the whole house. The landlord has many partners, but no one can
challenge his management of the property.
   The setup allows cash to move upstream from loss-making Texas
Air units to the parent _ in the form of management fees, rents on
planes and airport gates, commissions on fuel purchases and others.
   In its order for an investigation, the DOT said a number of
financial transactions between the parent and Eastern and
Continental ``raise questions concerning whether substantial funds
and other resources are being diverted from the air carrier
subsidiaries.''
   The department questioned, for example:
   _Texas Air shifting Eastern's profitable computer reservation
system into a separate subsidiary in exchange for a note ``which
may be less than the system's fair market value.''
   _Eastern paying ``substantial fees'' for management services,
fuel purchases and other activities provided by the parent company.
   _Eastern accepting a no-interest note, instead of cash, for $16
million in reimbursements owed to the airline as part of its
acquisition by Texas Air.
   _Texas Air borrowing $25 million from Eastern in March 1987 in
exchange for an unsecured note at a time when Eastern was having
cash flow problems.
   Texas Air recently proposed to spin off Eastern's profitable
Northeast shuttle service in exchange for an infusion of $225
million in cash and securities for the strapped airline, but that
attempt has been blocked by federal courts.
   While the DOT looks into the financial condition of Texas Air,
Eastern and Continental, the Federal Aviation Administration is
undertaking a stringent safety investigation of Miami-based
Eastern. The FAA on Wednesday fined Eastern $823,000 because of
``recurring trends'' of violations of safety regulations, and on
Thursday temporarily grounded five Eastern planes for minor safety
violations.

   Mercedes-Benz of North America wants you to
have a nice vacation in Europe.
   So the luxury automaker is offering free plane tickets on one
condition: that the trip include the purchase of a Mercedes in West
Germany.
   Since March 30, Mercedes has been giving two round-trip economy
plane tickets, or one business-class ticket, on Pan Am or Lufthansa
flights to customers who purchase and pick up autos from its
factory near Stuttgart.
   As under most European pick-up programs, the company pays for
shipment of the car back to the United States and for a 2.5 percent
import duty.
   The net savings, according to spokesman A.B. Schuman at
Mercedes' U.S. headquarters in Montvale, is about 8 percent off the
retail price.
   Schuman said the free offer caters to overseas buyers who
frequently combine a European tour with their auto purchase, which
in turn saves the cost of renting an automobile.
   European delivery has been part of luxury-car marketing since
the early 1960s, Schuman said, and Mercedes' current gimmick is
part of a long-term marketing strategy.
   Mercedes sold 2,090 cars to Americans in West Germany last year,
out of a total 89,900 purchased for use in the United States.
   In an increasingly competitive luxury car market, Mercedes'
ticket offer has more to do with gaining a competitive edge than
with boosting European delivery sales, said spokesman Thomas O.
McGurn at rival BMW of North America in Montvale.
   Schuman said it was too early to tell the results of the
Mercedes' program, but a sales manager at the nation's largest
Mercedes dealership said he was pleased.
   ``It's done the job here,'' said Jerry Carter at Downtown L.A.
Motors in Los Angeles. Four buyers lured by the ticket offer made
deals on Wednesday and one called last weekend, when advertisements
for the program began appearing, Carter said.
   The ticket offer is one example of how luxury car makers are
competing for buyers, who have become reluctant because of
confusion over the new tax laws that went into effect in 1987, the
October stock market crash and the continuing decline of the
dollar, which has boosted foreign car prices, said BMW's McGurn.
   BMW, for instance, has boosted its advertising and is offering a
lower percentage financing on leasing rates.
   Of 87,800 domestic sales, 1,610 BMWs were picked up in Europe,
McGurn said.
   Saab-Scania of America Inc., based in Orange, Conn., reported
741 European deliveries for 1987 from four European locations, said
spokesman Jim Ventrilio.

<HEAD>Sporck Says National-Fairchild Merger A Huge Success</HEAD>

   The hard rain that fell on National
Semiconductor Corp. ceremonies honoring Silicon Valley pioneer
Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. has been practically the only thing
to dampen the recent merger of the two companies.
   The union of the two chipmakers has come off much more smoothly
than many analysts and rivals thought it would, without the
bloodbath of personnel cuts and violent organizational disruptions
predicted by some.
   National acquired struggling Fairchild on Oct. 1 for $122
million, after political pressure nixed a $200 million buyout by
Japan's Fujitsu Ltd., and found a silicon treasure trove, according
to National boss Charles E. Sporck.
   There were layoffs as the combined companies trimmed from 38,000
to 36,000 workers and there were ``ruffled feathers,'' Sporck
admits, as employees made adjustments and, in some cases, switched
jobs.
   But he says that a dynamic company has emerged from the merger,
with a broad range of products, solid research departments and
worldwide clout.
   ``I'm unaware of any other combination of two companies where a
merger's been pulled off so well in such a short period of time,''
Sporck said Thursday in his first interview on the merger since
last fall.
   Sporck said National will post revenue of about $2.5 billion
when its 1988 fiscal year ends May 31, enabling the company to leap
from 11th to fifth among world chip companies.
   He also estimated National would surpass the 12 percent growth
rate he thinks the industry will post over the next year as it
continues its recovery from a severe slump.
   ``The sum of the two companies is exceeding the parts
involved,'' said Michael Boss, analyst for San Jose-based market
research firm Dataquest Inc.
   ``It wasn't apparent from the figures for 1987,'' Boss said,
``but we really expect this to be a very good year for National. We
see some very good blending together of technologies and markets.''
   Sporck said National got more than it bargained for.
   ``Our estimates were conservative, both in terms of the
financial impact and technology,'' he said. ``There was a
perception on our part, as well as the industry's that Fairchild
had a somewhat empty basket in terms of product. It wasn't until
after we truly started looking seriously that we realized that was
a misconception.''
   Sporck said he particularly is impressed with Fairchild's high
speed and custom chips used for supercomputers and military
applications. Added to National's other lines of chips, the
combined company can offer customers a wide range of technologies.
   ``There is a trend among customers to reduce the number of
suppliers,'' he said. ``It saves money dealing with fewer people,
and they realize, as we do, that more profitable relations occur
when the two engineering organizations work closely together.
   ``It's a benefit we really didn't understand when we first
started the Fairchild involvement.''
   Huddled under golf umbrellas, Fairchild's eight founders
gathered among about 2,000 guests Thursday as Sporck praised it as
``the granddaddy of all semiconductor companies'' and dedicated the
new $75 million Fairchild Research Center.
   It was National's way of preserving the name and spirit of the
company that spawned Silicon Valley's biggest chipmakers, including
Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and National.
   ``Fairchild had tremendously talented people and an unusual,
free-swinging environment,'' said Sporck, who joined Fairchild as a
production manager and rose to head of the semiconductor division
before he left to join National in 1967.
   ``They were prepared to accept unusual behavior from people
given they have talent,'' he said. ``One of the negatives of that,
of course, is we bred a lot of entrepreneurs and they went out and
started a lot of companies, which wasn't necessarily in the best
interests of Fairchild. But all of us have a tinge of nostalgia for
Fairchild.''

<HEAD>Steel Imports Down In February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steel imports declined in February to the
target set by the Reagan administration for its quota program,
except for metal imported by U.S. companies for rolling on their
own mills.
   But American producers said Thursday that the 1.9 million tons
imported in February in both categories represented the highest
single-month level since November 1986.
   ``Increasing volume of semi-finished steel imports, badly needed
by domestic rolling mills themselves, continues a trend evident
since the beginning of 1988,'' said Erwin L. Klein, president of
the New York-based American Institute for Imported Steel.
   The AIIS is composed largely of European steelmakers who sell
products in the United States. The Washington-based American Iron
and Steel Institute represents domestic companies. Both intepret
U.S. Commerce Department data separately.
   The importers said February steel imports, excluding 284,900
tons of semi-finished metal headed for U.S. mills, totaled 1.6
million tons, or 18.8 percent of the domestic market. They said
that's close to the 18.5 percent goal set by President Reagan in
launching the quota program in late 1984.
   Including semi-finished steel, February imports represented 22.1
percent of the U.S. market. That was up from 21.8 percent in
January, when 1.8 million tons entered the country, but down from
25 percent in February 1987, when 1.8 million tons entered a
smaller domestic market, the AIIS said Thursday.
   The U.S. producers calculate the administration's goal as 20.2
percent of the market, including semi-finished steel.
   The importers said semi-finished steel represented 15 percent of
February's total imports.
   ``Even these sharply increased semi-finished steel imports are
still unable to satisfy demand, as indicated by escalating
petitions of American rolling mills to the U.S. Commerce Department
for short-supply allocation,'' said Klein, vice chairman of the
import firm STEELINTER USA Inc.
   The short supply petitions are requests for permission to import
steel in excess of the quotas, which the administration negotiated
at the request of the domestic producers. Unless extended, the
quotas will expire in September 1989.

<HEAD>Steelmaker To Pay $85 Million In Pension Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. has
agreed in principle to pay $85 million to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp. to settle all pension insurance claims against the
company.
   Under the settlement announced Thursday, which is subject to
approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Wheeling-Pittsburgh will pay
about $60 million in cash and a secured note for $25 million upon
confirmation of the troubled steelmaker's bankruptcy reorganization
plan.
   The settlement is over PBGC claims stemming from the termination
of seven Wheeling-Pittsburgh pension plans serving 21,500 workers
in November 1985, seven months after the company filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   PBGC, a government agency that insures pension plan participants
against losses, says it has claims totaling more than $600 million,
although the claims are limited by law to 30 percent of the
company's net worth.
   In a news release issued from Washington, PBGC said the
settlement granted it full recovery of its original claims for
unpaid contributions due to the pension plans during the period the
company filed for bankruptcy protection.
   ``This agreement provides PBGC a substantial recovery, but
allows the company to move ahead with its reorganization,'' sid
Royal S. Dellinger, the agency's chief negotiator. ``It also
confirms that failure to meet pension promises is very costly.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh stated that it was ``pleased that the
parties were able to resolve their differences without further
litigation, and that one of the major obstacles to a plan of
reorganization has been removed.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation in Britain rose 0.4 percent in March
from the previous month, while the country's unemployment rate
declined by 0.1 percent, the government announced Friday.
   The Department of Employment attributed the rise in its retail
price index to increases spread over a large range of goods and
services, mostly for foods, motor vehicles, household goods,
clothing and footwear.
   The index was 3.5 percent higher than in March 1987, the
department said.
   Meanwhile, unemployment fell to a seasonally adjusted 9 percent
of the work force last month from 9.1 percent in February.
   The figure was down from 10.9 percent in March 1987, the
department said.
   Total seasonally adjusted unemployment was estimated at 2.505
million people in March, down from a revised 2.533 million in
February and 3.037 million in March 1987.

   Safety violations discovered in six Eastern
Airlines planes during an unprecedented federal inspection involved
mechanical problems that occur daily, a spokeswoman for the company
said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration forced Eastern to take the
planes out of service Thursday, the second day of an inspection of
the company's 267 aircraft.
   An FAA spokesman characterized the safety flaws as ``minor
violations.''
   ``We have 1,400 flights a day, and every day you're going to
have so many mechanical problems,'' company spokeswoman Paula Musto
said.
   ``They would have been found on this day or another day, and
more than likely they would have been found by Eastern's own
mechanics. But we have people looking over our shoulder now.''
   In Minneapolis, an Atlanta-bound flight filled with passengers
was unloaded because of a fuel leak. Eastern had cleared the plane
for takeoff, but FAA inspectors refused to let it fly, NBC News
reported.
   Two other planes were also taken out of service because of minor
fuel leaks, said Bob Buckhorn, FAA spokesman in Washington. One
plane was sidelined by cut tires and another by a problem with
emergency escape path markings in the cabin, Buckhorn said.
   ``You're talking minor violations,'' he said.
   Late Thursday a sixth plane was taken out of service when an
inch-long crack was discovered in the skin of a plane in St. Louis,
said FAA spokesman John Leyden. He said it was not a serious
problem.
   The airline can return the planes to service as soon as the
problems are corrected.
   ``If (inspectors) find any irregularities, they bring them to
the attention of the airline, who then takes the planes out of
service until they fix them properly,'' said FAA spokesman Jack
Barker in Atlanta.
   Barker said 54 other planes that had been checked as part of the
inspection program were ruled safe for flying. Ms. Musto said she
didn't know whether the planes cited for violations had been
repaired.
   The 30-day inspection of all Eastern planes began Wednesday
after the FAA fined the company $823,000 for safety violations.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said officials have been
unsatisfied with Eastern's performance since its takeover in 1986
by Texas Air Corp., which will undergo a 30-day inspection of its
operating practices.
   Texas Air, which commands a fifth of the nation's air travel
market, also owns Continental Airlines, which has recently absorbed
Frontier Airlines, People Express and New York Air.
   The government's financial probe will examine the corporation's
management and business practices and the relationships between the
parent and the two airlines, said B. Wayne Vance, general counsel
for the Department of Transportation.
   Around Eastern's Miami home base, passengers and travel agents
said the inspection and new fines were worrisome.
   ``Some of my customers already don't want to fly on Eastern
anymore,'' said Isabel Chalen, owner of the Four Corners Travel
Agency in Miami Beach.
   However, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said there has been
no drop in bookings.
   The FAA said its unprecedented inspection of Eastern planes will
include ``ramp checks'' of all of the carrier's aircraft.
   ``It's a visual inspection of the aircraft while it's parked at
the gate. The inspectors also will look at the log book, to make
sure the entries are correctly entered, they will check the
emergency equipment and that's basically what we're looking at,''
said Roger Myers, an FAA spokesman in Atlanta.

   Stock prices showed some further losses in
active trading today after Thursday's steep slide.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.30 to 2,000.34
in the first half hour of trading.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 2 in the
overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 224
up, 835 down and 424 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 33.80 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said blue-chip stocks attracted some early buying by
traders looking for ``bargains'' after the big drop on Thursday.
   But they also noted that stocks faced some formidable obstacles
in any bid to rebound.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods rose 0.6 percent in March. That put
added emphasis on recent worries about a possible revival of
inflationary pressures.
   At the same time, interest rates rose in the credit markets,
pushing yields on long-term Treasury bonds close to the 8.95
percent level.
   Brokers said the bond and stock markets were still feeling the
ill effects of the unexpected news Thursday that the nation's trade
deficit widened in February.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric dropped | to
40; Ford Motor \ to 44{; International Business Machines [ to 111\,
and American Telephone & Telegraph [ to 26{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.90 to 146.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.22 at 297.70.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 101.46 points
to 2,005.63, for its biggest drop since it tumbled 140.58 on Jan. 8.
   Declining issues overpowered advances by considerably more than
10 to 1 on the NYSE. Big Board volume came to 211.81 million
shares, against 185.12 million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   Occidental Petroleum Corp. has agreed to
acquire the plastics manufacturer Cain Chemical Inc. in a
transaction valued at $2.2 billion, the companies said.
   Under terms of a definitive merger agreement, Occidental will
pay $1.25 billion cash and will assume about $830 million in debt.
Including Cain preferred stock, the deal has an indicated value of
about $2.2 billion.
   Houston-based Cain will continue to operate with its present
employees as a separate, wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental,
according to the agreement, which has been approved by a majority
of Cain shareholders.
   The transaction will result in a pretax gain of $120 million for
Chase Manhattan Corp., which has had a stake in Cain since its
formation. In addition, about 43 percent of the proceeds of the
sale will be distributed to Cain employees, the company said in a
statement.
   Cain, a closely held concern, was formed in March 1987 by a
group headed by Gordon Cain. The group purchased and integrated
chemical operations from several major chemical companies including
PPG Industries Inc., E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., and ICI
Americas Inc.
   Cain now has seven plants on the Gulf Coast of Texas and is the
nation's fifth-largest maker of ethylene, a component of PVC
plastic.
   The merger will make Occidental the country's third-largest
ethylene producer.
   Occidental Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Armand Hammer
credited Cain with having built ``a strong position in
petrochemicals with its large, cost efficient ethylene plants and
its top quality high density polyethlyene facilities and products.''
   He said he expects the acquisition to ``significantly improve
Occidental's net income and cash flow'' in the long term.
   The acquisition, which is expected to be completed in early May,
will bring Occidental's long-term debt to $6.34 billion, a
spokesman said.
   Occidental is involved in businesses including oil, gas,
chemicals, fertilizers, coal and meat products.

   Billionaire real estate baron Harry Helmsley and
his ``hotel queen'' wife Leona underwent fingerprinting and mug
shots, then quietly sat with other alleged wrongdoers before
pleading innocent to charges in a 188-count state tax evasion
indictment.
   Less than an hour later, a federal tax evasion indictment was
announced against the Helmsleys, one of the world's wealthiest
couples, who own the Empire State Building and New York City's
Helmsley Palace Hotel and are estimated to be worth at least $1.4
billion.
   They were arraigned Thursday on state charges that they hid
about $4 million in renovations to their Greenwich, Conn., mansion
_ including a pool enclosure with a rooftop marble dance floor and
a $45,000 clock in the shape of one of their buildings _ as
business expenses and took bogus tax deductions.
   ``Not guilty!'' both replied in strong voices before State
Supreme Court Justice Carol Berkman, who rejected a prosecution
request for $1 million bails and released them on their own
recognizance.
   Helmsley, 79, and his 67-year-old wife had waited in the front
row of the courtroom while alleged drug dealers and thieves were
arraigned ahead of them. Mrs. Helmsley appeared depressed and at
one point her eyes welled with tears, smudging her mascara.
   ``The fact is they did not pay millions of dollars in income
tax,'' U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said 45 minutes later in
announcing a 47-count federal tax evasion indictment against the
Helmsleys on similar charges.
   As many as 30 past and current Helmsley employees reportedly
were given immunity from prosecution in return for testimony before
state and federal grand juries.
   ``It's the only palace in the world where the Queen stands
guard,'' says ads for the Helmsley Palace, but employees say that
royal appellation is matched by a volatile, queen-size temper.
   ``She comes on as extremely forthright, but that sometimes turns
into brutality,'' said one former employee, advertising executive
Jane Maas. ``She's icy, without compassion; she is remorseless and
pitiless.''
   Mrs. Helmsley recently turned down a deal from prosecutors, who
said they would not seek the indictment of her ailing husband if
she pleaded guilty to fraud, a source said.
   Helmsley attorney Stephen Kaufman, in a two-page statement, said
the couple had never evaded taxes and actually pay more than nearly
anyone else in the nation.
   The indictments were the result of an 18-month state and federal
probe, officials said.
   Prior to their arraignment, the Helmsleys were booked and
fingerprinted at Police Headquarters ``like anybody else,'' said
state Attorney General Robert Abrams. ``They received no special
treatment whatsoever.''
   The Helmsleys greeted reporters when they arrived at the
attorney general's office in a gray limousine, followed by a second
limousine with their security guards.
   According to the indictments, the Helmsleys spent about $4
million to refurbish their mansion with an enclosure for one of the
estate's two pools; a breakfast room and marble dance floor on the
roof of that enclosure; an elaborate indoor-outdoor stereo system;
more than $370,000 in landscaping; and an assortment of furniture
and paintings.
   In addition, a $45,000 birthday present for Helmsley _ a clock
in the shape of the Helmsley Building on Park Avenue _ was billed
to the Park Lane Hotel in December 1984, it said. The charges also
said four jade art objects worth $500,000 were paid for by four New
York City hotels as furniture purchases in 1984.
   Their Greenwich estate consists of a 28-room Tudor mansion on 29
acres. They also have a duplex atop the Park Lane Hotel in
Manhattan and a condominium in Palm Beach, Fla.
   Also pleading innocent to the state charges were Frank Turco,
45, of Lutz, Fla., Mrs. Helmsley's former top aide, and Joseph
Licari, 51, of Oyster Bay Cove, N.Y., the couple's former financial
manager.
   Both were also named in the federal indictment. Mrs. Helmsley,
the advertised ``queen'' of the couple's hotel chain, and Turco
face an additional federal charge of extortion conspiracy for
allegedly accepting kickbacks from Helmsley suppliers and employees.
   Each state felony count carries with it up to four years in
prison and a $500,000 fine; the federal counts carry sentences of
up to five years in prison and fines of up to $250,000.
   The extortion conspiracy count, however, can bring up to 20
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   State prosecutors requested $100,000 bail for the Helmsleys'
aides, but all four were released on their own recognizance pending
a June 1 court date.
   They are due in U.S. District Court on April 21 for arraignment
on the federal charges.

   The news that entertainer Merv
Griffin will take control of Resorts International Inc. from
developer Donald Trump surprised industry observers who watched the
two men squabble.
   But in announcing the preliminary agreement Thursday, Griffin
denied he and Trump had ever been at odds.
   ``I made my offer. He refused it. There was a lot of posturing
and a lot of public statements made,'' Griffin said, calling the
dealmaking of the past several weeks ``a great tennis game.''
   The agreement calls for Griffin to purchase Resorts' Class A
shares for $36 a share, or a total of about $206 million, and to
buy Trump's more powerful Class B shares at an undisclosed price
well above the $101 million that Trump paid last year.
   Although the agreement remains to be finalized on paper, the
biggest speculation is how much Trump will receive for his Class B
stock. All Griffin would say Thursday was that Trump was paid ``a
lot. (I) couldn't let him off easy, right? ... We don't want Donald
to take a loss on the B stock.''
   Harold Vogel, a gambling industry analyst with Merrill Lynch in
New York, also speculated that ``Mr. Trump wouldn't make a deal if
it wasn't good for him.''
   Trump now controls Resorts by owning 95 percent of the company's
outstanding Class B shares, and had tried since February to take
the company private, offering $22 for each of the company's 5.7
million outstanding shares of Class A stock.
   Marvin B. Roffman, an analyst with the investment firm Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, said the deal ``allows
Atlantic City to have another casino operating while the Taj is
operating.''
   Roffman referred to the state Casino Control Commission's
earlier decision allowing Trump to close Resorts' casino in order
to open the Taj Mahal.
   Under state law, no one may own more than three casinos. Trump
already owns Trump Plaza and Trump's Castle casino hotels in
Atlantic City, and opening the Taj Mahal would put him at the limit.
   Roffman said Griffin ``is certainly happy because he'll have one
of the finest collections of real estate parcels in America.''
   Roffman said he would not be surprised if Griffin sold off
Resorts' Paradise Island property to his California neighbor,
Marvin Davis. Last year, the oilman offered to buy the Bahamas
operation for up to $260 million.
   For 23 years, Griffin served as host of the popular ``Merv
Griffin Show,'' one of television's longest-running series, winning
10 Emmy Awards. He parlayed his entertainment fortune into a
business empire that includes radio stations, a major
closed-circuit television operation widely used at racetracks and
extensive real estate holdings in California.
   As part of the agreement with Griffin, Trump says he will buy
the 1,250-room Taj Mahal and the nearby Steel Pier from Resorts for
an undisclosed price. The gaming hall, with an estimated completion
cost of $938.5 million, is under construction next door to the
Resorts' existing Boardwalk casino.
   William Klein, a New York attorney representing the owners of
about 800,000 shares of Class A stock, said he doubts his clients
will be unhappy with the tentative agreement.
   The $36-a share offer, he said, ``is nearly double Trump's offer
_ it's a lot better than $22 a share. I think this is an
extraordinary solution of a very difficult problem because of the
personalities involved and the complexities of the deal.''

   The stock market suffered another broad setback
today, extending Thursday's steep slide amid increased inflation
worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 101.46 points on
Thursday, fell 21.89 to 1,983.75 by 11 a.m. today on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 2 in the
overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 293
up, 1,038 down and 404 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 89.80 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said blue-chip stocks attracted some early buying by
traders looking for ``bargains'' after the big drop on Thursday.
   But they also noted that stocks faced some formidable obstacles
in any bid to rebound.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods rose 0.6 percent in March. That put
added emphasis on recent worries about a possible revival of
inflationary pressures.
   At the same time, interest rates rose in the credit markets,
pushing yields on long-term Treasury bonds close to the 8.95
percent level.
   Brokers said the bond and stock markets were still feeling the
ill effects of the unexpected news Thursday that the nation's trade
deficit widened in February.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down 1 at
39|; Primerica, down 1[ at 24~; Merck, down | at 159, and DuPont,
down \ at 82{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.64 to 145.50. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.03 at 296.89.

<NOTE>Eds: NEW thruout to UPDATE with agreement near on intermarket
circuit breaker. A version moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairmen of the New York Stock Exchange
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange say they expect agreement soon
on a plan to halt trading in stocks and stock-index futures when
the markets rise or fall 200 to 300 points in one day.
   The heads of the two fiercely competitive exchanges _ New York
for stocks and Chicago for futures _ on Thursday told a House panel
examining the October stock market collapse that they hoped to
agree on the plan within the next month.
   However, Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago exchange's
executive committee, and John J. Phelan, chairman and chief
executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange, differed on just
how far the markets should move before trading is interrupted.
   Phelan said the trading should not be halted until the Dow Jones
Industrial Average moves 250 to 300 points, while Melamed said the
limits should be in the range of 200 to 250 points.
   Melamed and Phelan said since October they have met several
times in an effort to achieve greater coordination. Congressional
leaders _ particularly Senate Banking Committee Chairman William
Proxmire, D-Wis., and House finance subcommittee Chairman Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass. _ had been complaining about the lack of progress
in talks among the exchanges and among federal regulatory agencies.
   ``You've got to let the market seek its own level, but there
comes a time when a systematic halt _ a safety net _ that is known
in advance is helpful,'' Phelan said.
   ``In the futures market, we are not uncomfortable with price
limits; we already have them,'' Melamed said. ``It just depends on
where you draw the line.'' He said short halts in trading ``are a
necessary evil, perhaps, but something we could live with.''
   Phelan said the purpose of the halts would be to allow the
market ``to stop and take a look at itself.'' He said they should
be more than 30 minutes but should not last all day.
   Both chairmen told the House finance subcommittee that President
Reagan's new working group on the markets has indicated a
circuit-breaker plan is a high priority.
   Currently, the Big Board limits a form of computerized trading
known as index arbitrage _ which links the New York stock markets
with the Chicago futures markets _ once the Dow moves 50 points,
either up or down.
   The Chicago exchange has set daily price limits on its Standard
& Poor's 500 stock index future, which is based on stocks traded on
the Big Board. There is an opening price limit that restricts any
move during the first l0 minutes of trading to the equivalent of
roughly 40 points on the Dow and a daily price limit equivalent to
between 120 and 150 Dow points.
   But such circuit breakers are not coordinated between New York
and Chicago.
   Melamed also said regulation of the nation's financial markets
by a single federal agency would do ``a great disservice'' to the
marketplace and that it ``is neither warranted nor wise.''
   Currently, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission oversees
the nation's futures markets and the Securities and Exchange
Commission regulates securities trading.
   Phelan said he believes one regulator should eventually be in
charge of all the markets.
   ``We believe ... that ultimately there should be a unified
regulator for all equity-related products,'' Phelan testified.
``But more immediately, it is much more important that we
strengthen the clearing and settlement process as well as put in
place an all-market circuit breaker in the event of a major market
decline.''
   Melamed said the roles of the CFTC and the SEC are so different
that they should not be combined.
   ``The number of true intermarket issues are few and limited in
scope,'' Melamed told the panel. ``Moreover, they must be resolved
now, not when the next crisis occurs.''

<HEAD>Kodak Furloughs Employees in Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. has given its workforce
in Panama a 15-day paid furlough because of the extreme difficulty
in doing business there, a company spokesman said today.
   The catalyst for the shutdown of Kodak's marketing facility,
retail film and camera shops and mini-lab processing centers was
last Friday's economic sanctions imposed by President Reagan, said
Kodak spokesman Henry Kaska.
   ``We weren't ordered to close, but it just doesn't make sense to
stay open,'' Kaska said. ``We are not permitted to pay our utility
bill. We can't pay the phone bill. We were also concerned about the
security of our people traveling in that country.''
   The sanctions were ordered April 8 by Reagan in an effort to
force military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega to surrender his hold
on the Central American country.
   They include prohibiting payments to the Noriega regime by all
U.S. citizens and organizations in Panama, freezing the U.S. assets
of the Panamanian government, and prohibiting any person or company
in the United States from making any payments to the regime.
   Kaska said he didn't have an exact figure on the number of Kodak
employees, but estimated it was less than 1,000. He said the
furlough went into effect Tuesday.
   ``After the 15 days we'll reevaluate and reassess and determine
whether there should be another furlough,'' Kaska said. ``We hope
the situation will stabilize within a month.''
   He said Kodak would continue to service its copiers in the
Panama Canal Zone and will keep its photo processing mini-labs open
there.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened steady to
slightly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts said prices could fall on more profit-taking after last
week's sharp gains. But any early selling pressure was limited by a
continuation of the wave of buying that ended Thursday's session.
   ``There's not a whole lot going on,'' said Joel Karlin, research
analyst for Research Department Inc. in Chicago. ``We might have
some general liquidation today.''
   The grain markets were a bit jittery after Thursday's
stock-market plunge. The Dow Jones industrial average opened only a
few points below Thursday's close, but was down nearly 25 points by
mid-morning.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.15\ a bushel; corn was \ cent
lower to \ cent higher with May at $2.04\ a bushel; oats were \

   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the

   Live cattle were .05 cent to .25 cent lower with April at 73.57
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .20 cent lower with
April at 79.45 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .27 cent lower
with April at 44.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .17

   The world's top financial leaders did their
best to reassure jittery financial markets today amid signs that
their multimillion-dollar effort to stabilize the value of the
dollar was working.
   The finance leaders, wrapping up the spring meeting of the
151-nation International Monetary Fund, issued an optimistic
communique that predicted continued global economic growth despite
the turmoil on financial markets.
   Dutch Finance Minister H. Onno Ruding said the sharp selloff of
the dollar Thursday had not changed the view that growth prospects
this year remain bright.
   ``Members were aware of the developments in the markets (during
their deliberations Thursday) but it has not changed dramatically
the actions of our meetings because we are trying to improve the
system regardless of the vagaries of the market from day to day,''
Ruding told reporters.
   Still, the rout of the dollar on world currency markets Thursday
represented a major embarrassment for the finance leaders coming as
it did only 18 hours after they had issued a glowing assessment of
the global economy.
   The world's seven largest economies, the United States, Japan,
West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy, had bragged in
their joint statement on Wednesday of the success they had had in
the last four months in keeping the dollar from falling further.
   The so-called Group of Seven renewed their pledge to cooperate
closely in coming months to keep the dollar stable.
   That commitment was tested dramatically on Thursday as the
dollar suffered its worst decline since late last year as nervous
investors dumped the greenback following a disappointing increase
in the U.S. trade deficit for February.
   The dollar traded in a narrow range today after dropping about 2
percent on Thursday against such currencies as the Japanese yen,
West German mark and British pound. Central banks continued to prop
up the dollar by buying dollars with other currencies on the open
market.
   Administration sources, who spoke on condition that they not be
identified, said that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III held a
hasty 10-minute discussion with his counterparts from other nations
Thursday in the midst of the dollar's decline.
   These sources said the finance ministers discussed their joint
efforts to intervene to break the dollar's fall by government
purchases of the greenback.
   Currency traders estimated that the amount of government
intervention may have totaled as much as $700 million on Thursday
alone.
   Sources at the IMF meeting confirmed that there was further
intervention taking place today. Those efforts seemed to be working
as the dollar edged up slightly in early trading in New York amid
reports that the Federal Reserve, the West German Central Bank and
the Bank of England were buying dollars.
   Finance ministers could only hope that the latest turmoil in
foreign exchange markets would not lead to a prolonged test of
their commitments to spend the resources of their treasuries or
trigger renewed turmoil on stock exchanges and on the bond market.
   Even after Thursday's market turmoil, the finance ministers were
looking for a silver lining, noting that the massive intervention,
while costing substantial sums, had kept the dollar from going into
a free fall.
   ``The Group of Seven is not daunted by this,'' said Canadian
Finance Minister Michael Wilson late Thursday.
   German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the hectic
dollar trading was ``not threatening'' as the economic leaders let
it be known they stood ready to spend more sums if necessary to
stabilize the dollar.
   ``I think what you see today is a very good example of
international cooperation because there has been concerted
intervention in support of the dollar involving a very large number
of countries,'' Nigel Lawson, the British chancellor of the
exchequer, told reporters.
   Baker, the prime architect of the three-year effort to manage
the dollar, said the markets were wrong to read so much into one
month's adverse trade report.
   He said the overall trend was toward a lower U.S. trade deficit
and this development was being aided by the efforts of Japan and
West Germany to stimulate their domestic demand, something the
administration has long urged.
   ``Monthly trade figures are by their nature erratic. What is
important is that we are continuing along the general path of
reduced imbalances,'' Baker said Thursday in a speech to the
finance ministers.
   The administration is counting on improvements in the American
trade deficit to supply fully half of U.S. economic growth this
year, one of the reasons that markets react so negatively if the
monthly trade figures don't show improvement.
   The $13.8 billion February trade imbalance was up 11 percent
from the January deficit and was the worst showing since last
October's record $17.6 billion deficit. The problem in February was
that a surge in imports swamped further improvement in exports.
   ``The nation's trade problems are severe and far from over,''
said Rudy Oswald, the AFL-CIO's chief economist. ``While exports
are up by $10 billion from a year ago, so are imports, leaving
America no further along the path towards reducing the
jobs-destroying deficit.''
   Baker has been struggling with the trade problem ever since he
took over as Treasury secretary at the start of President Reagan's
second term in 1985.
   Baker switched administration policy in September 1985 from a
hands-off approach concerning the dollar to a coordinated effort
with other countries to drive the dollar lower as a way of curbing
Americans' appetite for foreign goods and boosting the
competitiveness of U.S. products overseas.
   After the dollar had fallen substantially throughout 1986, Baker
reversed course again in February 1987 when the Group of Seven
countries declared that the dollar had fallen enough. They served
notice that the seven nations would begin intervening to support
the dollar's value.
   That declaration proved ineffective for much of 1987 as the
dollar came under renewed selling pressure, but a new
dollar-stabilization pact reached Dec. 22 had appeared to be
working until Thursday's sell-off.

   Wholesale prices jumped 0.6 percent in March,
the biggest increase in 11 months, the government said today in a
report that added to jitters on financial markets about inflation
and the health of the economy.
   The March increase more than erased a 0.2 percent drop in
Feburary.If the March rate held for 12 months, the full-year
wholesale inflation rate would be 7 percent, compared with 2.2
percent for all of 1987.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue-chip industrial
stocks, which staged its fifth biggest loss and dropped more than
101 points Thursday in reaction to disappointing trade figures,
fell 22 points to 1983.75 in the first 90 minutes of trading today.
   The Labor Department said in today's report on wholesale price
activity that energy prices, which had been falling at an annual
rate of 17 percent, rose 0.9 percent last month, their first
increase since August.
   Food prices, after dropping 1.1 percent in February, advanced by
0.7 percent last month. For the first three months of the year,
beef and veal prices climbed 43.6 percent.
   Overall, wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percent
from January through March.
   ``The widespread nature of these price changes suggests that
inflation pressures may be intensifying,'' said Donald Ratajczak, a
Georgia State University economist who specializes in wholesale
price trends.
   Ratajczak and other economists anticiated that today's price
report would add to the havoc evident Thursday following the
government's announcement that the nation's trade deficit worsened
significantly in February.
   ``Yesterday's news and the flailings of the lemmings on Wall
Street combined with today's price numbers are going to create a
volatile climate for a while,'' said Dirk Van Dongen, president of
the National Association of Wholesalers. ``Again, they were a
surprise and above the predictions of all the experts.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Reagan
administration was ``disappointed'' with the increase in wholesale
prices today as well as the trade figures Thursday.
   ``We think the market has overreacted to a one-time report, and
we hope this thing will stabilize,'' Fitzwater said.
   Reflecting the broad nature of March's price gains, the Labor
Department said that its index of wholesale prices for consumer
goods other than food and energy rose 0.4 percent, compared with a
0.3 percent increase in February.
   Because food and energy prices can fluctuate greatly from month
to month, analysts look to the calculation that excludes them as
providing a good underlying indication of inflationary pressures.
For the first three months of 1988, wholesale prices for goods
other than food and energy rose at an annual rate of 5.7 percent.
   Automobile prices were up 1 percent last month, restoring them
to the level they had been at in November before manufacturers
began offering dealers rebates and other incentives.
   Prescription drug prices rose 1.3 percent and over-the-counter
drug costs advanced 2 percent in March. Newspaper prices rose 1.4
percent.
   Wholesale gasoline prices rose 1.5 percent after dropping about
9 percent since November. Home heating oil prices jumped 2.6
percent.
   Costs rose for a variety of food products that had dropped in
price in February. Among them were eggs, fresh fruits, coffee,
poultry, fish and pasta products.
   Other goods showing 1 percent or greater price increases one
step short of the retail level included carpeting, draperies and
jewelry.
   Capital equipment prices rose 0.4 percent, double the increases
of January and February. The biggest price gains _ above 1 percent
_ were in metal-cutting machine tools and office and store
equipment.
   Prices dropped slightly, however, for other goods, including
women's clothing, shoes, cosmetics, glassware and home electronic
equipment.
   March's overall gain brought the wholesale price index to 106.2.
That means a selection of good costing $100 at the wholesale level
in 1982 would have cost $106.20 last month, or 30 cents more than
in February.
   Wholesale prices rose only 2.2 percent for all of 1987. The
index, however, does not include two categories where price
increases have been more pronounced in recent months _ services and
imports.
   Those two categories are included in the consumer price index,
which rose 4.4 percent last year.
   Consumer prices for the first two months of 1988 were running at
an annual rate of 3.2 percent. Figures on retail price activity in
March will not be out until later this month.

1.20 to 145.94. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.62 at 296.30.

<HEAD>Equilibrium at a Very High Level</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy is now at a stage where too much
``good'' news could have bad effects, in much the same way an extra
helping of dessert can ruin the digestion.
   It is a tricky situation for the economy to be in, and it is
being watched closely by everyone on Wall Street, the Federal
Reserve Board, the White House and the forecasting fraternity.
   The reason is that the economy is now in critical balance. The
capacity of plants and factories may be nearing the maximum, for
example, so you don't want a lot of additional activity. That might
spur inflation.
   It could mean a big demand for more workers, too. And since the
jobless rate is now at a seven-year low of 5.6 percent any pressure
there could upset the wage contentment that has existed for several
years.
   A production spurt could mean higher interest rates as well, and
that of course could be bad for securities, homebuying and
credit-card borrowing, not to mention spending by business to
alleviate the condition with added capacity.
   Albert Sommers, consultant to the Conference Board, puts its
this way: ``The U.S. operating level is too high for strong
economic news to be good for either the bond market or the equity
market.''
   Therefore, he and many of his forecasting brethren are looking
for a slow but steady pace of economic expansion, something in the
area of 2 percent or less. If that happens, they say, equilibrium
elsewhere might be maintained.
   But seldom have economists needed their limbs more than today,
because almost every look into the future is conditioned by ``on
the other hand.'' And just a slight economic change might require
immediate use of that hand.
   As you might expect, there is still some disagreement on how
near the manufacturing segment is to full production. The official
rate, as of February, was 82.5 percent, or 3 points higher than the
average for 1970-1988.
   Many analysts view the current level as close to maximum, beyond
which there would be an increasing likelihood of production
strains, resulting in the hiring of less skilled workers, falling
productivity and rising prices.
   But Wright Investors' Service, recognized for its skill with
statistics, has another viewpoint.
   It points out that from 1950 through 1959, inflation was at a
minimum while plant utilization rose as high as 91.7 percent. And
at one point in the relatively calm 1960s the rate was almost as
high.
   It would take at least two years of robust growth before the
nation's overall factory operating rates would exceed 85 percent,
says Wright, and even then there would be a question of whether
concerns were legitimate.
   That view seems not to be the most widely accepted one, however,
and so a great deal of tension exists among investors and the
Federal Reserve about the possibility of good news _ strong
production _ being bad news.
   It explains to some extent the inability of the securities
markets to make pronounced moves in either direction. It explains
why slow rather than fast economic growth is ``in.''
   Considering what the country has been through _ the extremes of
inflation, high interest rates and recession within the span of a
decade _ it isn't the worst of situations.

<HEAD>London Stocks Close Lower But Above Worst Levels</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: updates with close.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices closed lower Friday, but well above
their worst levels of the day as bargain-hunting and takeover
rumors helped the market regain some lost ground.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 selected stocks
fell 8.6 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,778.6.
   The index fell 24.1 points at the opening, but dealers said the
real low for the day came in trading before the official opening,
when the index was down as much as 38 points.
   Volume was moderate at 472.9 million shares, down from 517.3
million on Thursday.
   Share prices were marked down sharply from the outset of
trading, following Thursday's plunge on Wall Street, when the Dow
Jones industrial average lost more than 100 points.
   But British institutional buyers were attracted by the low
prices and the market rose steadily in the morning until it was
down 4.6 points in the early afternoon.
   Weakness in the early going on Wall Street took London prices
down from their best levels.
   However, dealers were heartened by the market's resilience in
the face of New York's sell-off Thursday.
   ``We're coming into the area where the market is looking
attractive to fund managers,'' said Michael Howell, European
equities strategist at Salomon Brothers International.

<HEAD>Dollar Retreats Further on New Economic Data, Gold Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished lower against major foreign
currencies on Friday after another disappointing set of U.S.
economic indicators, but dealers said central bank intervention
tempered its fall.
   The pound rose strongly as investors again moved in to take
advantage of higher British interest rates.
   Gold prices moved up around the globe.
   The dollar was hurt by news that U.S. producer prices increased
a larger-than-expected 0.6 percent during March and that industrial
output climbed 0.1 percent, less than expected, during the month.
   However, any further fall in the dollar was tempered by reported
intervention from the Deutsche Bundesbank, the U.S. Federal Reserve
and the Bank of England.
   ``The dealers didn't wish to take on the central banks,'' one
trader said.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar fell 2.02 yen to a closing 124.13. Later, in London, it was
quoted at 123.90 yen.
   In London, it cost $1.8890 to buy one pound, dearer than $1.8755
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.6605 West German marks, down from 1.6635; 1.3720
Swiss francs, down from 1.3745; 5.6325 French francs, down from
5.6390; 1.8630 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8680; 1,232.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,244.00; and 1.2335 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2368.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $456.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $451.
   In Zurich, gold was higher, closing at a bid $455.50, compared
with $450.50 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $5.45 to close at a bid $454.93.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.49 a troy ounce, compared
with Thursday's $6.43.

   Stock prices declined broadly today, extending
Thursday's steep slide amid increased inflation worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 101.46 points on
Thursday, lost .67 to 2,004.97 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in the
overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 457
up, 1,037 down and 417 unchanged.
   Analysts said blue-chip stocks attracted some tentative buying
by traders looking for ``bargains'' after the big drop on Thursday.
   But they also noted that stocks faced some formidable obstacles
in any bid to rebound.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods rose 0.6 percent in March. That put
added emphasis on recent worries about a possible revival of
inflationary pressures.
   At the same time, interest rates rose in the credit markets,
pushing yields on long-term Treasury bonds close to the 8.95
percent level.
   Brokers said the bond and stock markets were still feeling the
ill effects of the unexpected news Thursday that the nation's trade
deficit widened in February.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down { at
40[; Primerica, down 1\ at 24}; Merck, down 1[ at 158{, and DuPont,
down [ at 82|.
   An exception was International Business Machines, which rose 2[
to 113{. Earlier this week, the company reported a first-quarter
earnings gain that drew high marks from most analysts.
   Texaco rose ~ to 47} in active trading. The company, which
recently emerged from bankruptcy protection, voted a
75-cents-a-share quarterly dividend and expanded the plans for its
restructuring program.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.60 to 146.54. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.10 at 297.82.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 177.27 million shares with two
hours to go.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communications Satellite Corp. on Friday
reported a 68 percent jump in its first quarter profit over a year
ago.
   Net income for the three months ended March 31 totaled $14.3
million, or 77 cents a share, compared with earnings of $8.5
million, or 44 cents, in 1987.
   Revenue totaled $84.1 million vs. $80.7 million. Operating
income, however, fell from $22.9 million to $18.4 million, the
company said.
   The jump in revenue was attributed largely to the acquisition of
full ownership in Comsat Video Enterprises Inc., which was added to
the company in the second quarter of last year.
   This was partially offset, though, by a decline in revenue from
Intelsat Satellite Services. While international business was up,
revenue declined because of rate reductions to customers under
long-term contracts, Comsat reported.
   Comsat provides international, domestic and maritime
communications facilities via satellite and researches
communications techniques.

<HEAD>Bond Market Jolted by Unexpected Economic Strength</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bond market got an earful of economic news
this past week, and didn't like a lot of what it heard.
   ``It was a week of surprises, all of them negative,'' said
William Griggs of the financial consulting firm Griggs & Santow
Inc. in New York.
   The reports on March retail sales and wholesale prices and the
February trade deficit indicated the economy is growing faster than
post-stock market crash pessimists had expected and that inflation
may be accelerating.
   Faster economic growth and rising prices are the enemy in the
bond market, and prices slumped on the news, pushing long-term
yields toward their highest levels since they exceeded 9 percent in
mid-January.
   By midafternoon Friday, the prices of some long-term Treasury
bonds were priced to yield 8.93 percent, up from 8.68 percent at
the end of the previous week and from 8.3 percent in early February.
   The government reported Wednesday that retail sales rose 0.8
percent in March, stronger than most analysts had expected. ``It
was another indication that the consumer has the ability to spend
and is doing it,'' Griggs said.
   More disconcerting was news the next day that the nation's trade
deficit had widened to $13.8 billion in February. Most analysts had
expected a contraction in the deficit to the $11 billion to $12
billion range.
   Continued strength in imports raised the possibility that
inflation would accelerate, possibly prompting the Federal Reserve
Board to tighten credit conditions in an effort to ward off higher
prices.
   Adding to inflation concerns was Friday's report that wholesale
prices rose 0.6 percent in March or about twice as fast as most
analysts had expected.
   ``That was one more bit of bad news that the market could have
done without,'' said Elliott Platt, research director for
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York.
   He said next month's wholesale price figure could be even worse
if oil prices continue their recent rise.
   Most economists caution against reading too much into any single
economic report, noting that they are often subject to revision.
   But Robert Chandross, chief economist for Lloyds Bank PLC in New
York, said the rise in wholesale prices nonetheless indicates
``something is going on, on the inflation front that is pretty
negative.''
   ``I had thought April was going to be difficult, and this raises
the likelihood that the Fed will have to tighten further,'' he
said. ``They may not do it right away but if we get some strong
employment figures for April, it would leave them no alternative.''
   Sun Won Sohn, chief economist for Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis,
said the series of economic reports ``was extremely disappointing''
because the consensus estimates were wrong in each case.
   Sohn said he had expected long-term rates would decline in May,
but said the latest reports prompted him to delay that projection.
He is now looking for long-term rates to edge up to 9 percent and
not begin falling until July or August. He expects long-term rates
will be as low as 8.3 percent by November.
   DLJ's Platt expects long-term rates will rise as high as 9.25
percent by the end of the month, but then decline as low as 8
percent by early summer.
   But Griggs is decidedly more pessimistic. He said the gyrations
in the dollar have introduced a new element of risk for foreign
buyers of U.S. securities, and that rates will rise to compensate
them for that.
   Combined with the federal government's continuing strong
borrowing demands and an expected acceleration of inflation, Griggs
said he expects long-term rates will rise to 10 percent or more by
the end of the year.
   Chandross is looking for long-term rates to stay in a narrow
range, rising to 9 percent before slipping to 8.75 percent during
May.
   ``There is enough skittishness in the economy right now that
there is a self-correcting mechanism at work under which rising
rates dampen certain kinds of economic activity and that leads
rates to fall,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Puts Brakes On Dissident Ad Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new advertising agency started by former
officers of Lord Geller Federico Einstein Inc. has been temporarily
prohibited from accepting any more employees or clients from Lord
Geller.
   Judge Herman Cahn of state Supreme Court made the ruling on
Thursday, extending an April 6 order that barred two of the new
agency's founders, Richard Lord and Arthur Einstein Jr., from
recruiting Lord Geller clients or staff for the new agency, Lord
Einstein O'Neill & Partners.
   But the ruling does not affect employees or clients who have
already made the switch. The judge said the order will remain in
effect until a court hearing later this month. No specific date was
set.
   Six top executives walked off their jobs at Lord Geller on March
18 to form the new agency, complaining that they felt constrained
under the ownership of WPP Group PLC, the British firm that bought
Lord Geller in its purchase of JWT Group Inc. in July 1987.
   They have been joined by several dozen former Lord Geller
employees at the new agency.
   Two Lord Geller clients, the New Yorker magazine and WNBC-TV,
said they were switching to the new agency and a third client,
International Business Machines Corp., said it was assigning some
short-term projects to the new agency.
   WPP filed suit against the former executives, charging they
breached their duties to the agency and conspired to take away
business. WPP had requested that the judge expand his April 6 order
to apply to the agency as well as to Lord and Einstein.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid heavy liquidation by speculative
investment funds. The grains also closed lower.
   Analysts said Chicago-based C&D Commodities, the largest
speculative firm on the floor, led the decline by selling large
numbers of contracts for soybeans and soybean products that it had
purchased in recent weeks.
   The funds were reacting to a number of factors, including good
harvest weather for the South American soybean crop, disappointing
export sales last week and relatively high cash prices for soybeans
and soybean products, said Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed
analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``We're just way out of whack with prices of cottonseed meal and
corn,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 3} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.12} a bushel; corn was 1\ cents

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First City Bancorporation of Texas Inc. on Friday
extended for a sixth time the deadline for debtholders to tender
securities required under a $1.5 billion federally assisted
reorganization plan.
   The company also announced that its completion date for the
reorganization was rescheduled to next Tuesday instead of Friday as
planned.
   ``The revised schedule will provide additional time to complete
financing arrangements and to circulate additional information to
prospective investors, including the current status of the debt
tender,'' said First City spokesman James E. Day.
   Thursday was the fifth deadline for debt holders who have balked
at tendering holdings at a loss. Participation had been lowered
from 90 percent to 70 percent. The new deadline is set for 4 p.m.
CDT Monday.
   As of Thursday, 66.1 percent, or $149.3 million, of the bank's
$225.8 million in bonds had been tendered. The company needs at
least $158 million of the outstanding debt tendered to complete the
deal.
   Chicago investor A. Robert Abboud's effort to rescue
Houston-based First City with the help of $970 million from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has been slowed by bondholders'
reluctance to part with the debt.
   The FDIC said Abboud, who would become chairman under the plan,
needs concessions from debt holders before it will advance the
money and let him take over the bank.
   Under the arrangement, First City senior debt holders have been
offered 45 cents on the dollar for their debt, while subordinated
debt holders have been offered 35 cents.
   The bonds not tendered by Monday's deadline become the
obligation of the revitalized First City. They would be worth more
than what Abboud is offering.
   First City, with 59 banks in Texas and one in South Dakota, grew
quickly during the Texas oil boom, but was buffeted by energy and
real estate losses when oil prices plummeted.
   For 1987, the state's fourth-largest bank holding company posted
a $1.1 billion loss.
   The bailout plan, announced in September, calls for $970 billion
in assistance from the FDIC, $500 million infusion of capital
raised privately by a group headed by Abboud and a spinoff of $1.79
billion in book value of poorly performing assets.

   Robert E. Allen, president and chief operating officer of
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., will preside over the meeting
instead, the company said.
   Olson, 62, is recuperating at home after surgery March 25 and is
receiving outpatient chemotherapy, the company confirmed earlier
this week.
   ``It's too early to say when he'll be back,'' Walter Murphy, a
company spokesman, said Friday.

   Here, at a glance, are developments in the economic picture
Friday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WHOLESALE PRICES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Energy and food prices shot upward as wholesale prices jumped
0.6 percent in March, the biggest increase in 11 months. The
increase erased a 0.2 percent drop in Feburary.
   If the March rate held for 12 months, the annual inflation rate
would be 7 percent, compared with 2.2 percent for all of 1987.
   Overall, wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percent
from January through March.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities edged
up 0.1 percent in March, somewhat counterbalancing signs that
inflation is reheating.
   Gains in production of autos and business equipment offset
declines in construction supplies and consumer goods other than
cars.
   The slight March advance followed no change in February and,
according to economists, indicates that the pickup in wholesale
prices may not be sustained.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSINESS INVESTMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Businesses plan to increase capital spending by 8 percent this
year to $419.9 billion, raising hopes manufacturers will expand
factory capacity enough to ease inflation pressures. It would be
the best gain since a 9.6 percent rise in 1985.
   Businesses spent $388.7 billion last year, a 1.7 percent
increase over 1986.
   The estimate, based on a survey completed in March, represented
an increase over a November survey, when businesses said they
planned to spend 7.3 percent more.

<HEAD>WALL STREET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices were widely mixed, showing signs of steadying after
Thursday's steep slide. The Dow Jones average rose 8.29 to
2,013.93, reducing its loss for the week to 76.26 points.
   At the same time, interest rates rose in the credit markets,
pushing yields on long-term Treasury bonds close to the 8.95
percent level.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DOLLAR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished lower against other currencies after the
wholesale prices report, but dealers said central bank intervention
tempered its fall.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 2.02 yen to a closing 124.13. Later,
in London, it was quoted at 123.90 yen.
   In London, it cost $1.8890 to buy 1 pound, higher than $1.8755
Thursday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FINANCE MINISTERS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   World finance leaders ended a tumultuous meeting of the
International Monetary Fund with words of assurance to nervous
financial markets and further efforts to rescue the U.S. dollar.
   The dollar's rout shattered the optimistic tone the finance
ministers hoped to impart in their first high-level discussions
since the Oct. 19 stock market collapse. The group's final
communique predicted continued growth for the world economy this
year at a ``steady, moderate'' pace.
   World Bank President Barber Conable said the overriding issue
facing the two lending organizations was reducing the poor
countries' debt burden, estimated to total $1.245 trillion by the
end of this year.

<HEAD>Texaco Reinstates Dividend; To Sell $2 Billion More in Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. announced Friday it will resume
paying a quarterly dividend and will sell off an additional $2
billion in assets as part of its restructuring.
   At its first meeting since Texaco emerged from Chapter 11
federal bankruptcy court reorganization on April 7, the oil giant's
board of directors authorized a 75-cent quarterly dividend, a move
analysts said is intended to bolster shareholder support for the
current management team.
   In closing trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Texaco jumped
$1.62{ to $48.75.
   Texaco had been barred from paying dividends after it filed for
bankruptcy protection on April 12, 1987, in the wake of its epic
legal battle with Pennzoil Co. The dividend will be paid June 10 to
shareholders of record May 3.
   In addition to authorizing the dividend, directors said they
planned to sell off $5 billion in assets to help reduce the
company's debt load.
   Texaco said in its 1987 annual report that it hoped to raise at
least $3 billion through the sale of assets, but Friday's action
increased that amount by $2 billion.
   James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief executive
officer, said in a statement that the resumption of dividends ``at
a substantial rate demonstrates Texaco's confidence that this
expanded restructuring will enable us to build a more profitable
company on a solid core of our most productive assets.''
   While Texaco can afford the roughly $726 million a year in
dividend payments, experts noted that the extra expense will eat up
nearly 100 percent of the company's projected earnings for the year.
   The $3-a-share annual dividend ``is not justified by Texaco's
current earnings prospects,'' said Bruce Lazier, vice president for
energy investments at Prescott Ball & Turben Inc. ``They probably
will not earn much more than the $3 (a share) rate.''
   Lazier called the dividend decision a ``defensive move''
designed to offer shareholders an incentive to ``ride along with
current management'' rather than side with corporate raider Carl C.
Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder and sharpest critic.
   ``For shareholders hoping for liquidation, this is a nail in
that coffin,'' Lazier said, referring to rumors that Texaco would
have been dismembered if Icahn won control. He unsuccessfully
sought a board seat.
   Speculation had been brewing in recent weeks that Texaco would
take some action to boost the value of its stock, so Friday's
announcement was not a complete surprise.
   ``I think (the dividend) will quell a lot of shareholder''
dissent, said James Van Alen, an oil analyst at Janney Montgomery
Scott in Philadelphia.
   As part of its asset sale, Texaco said it would dispose of
unidentified ``producing, manufacturing and marketing assets, both
domestic and overseas.''
   Last week Texaco confirmed it is negotiating to sell its
Deutsche Texaco AG subsidiary, which operates 1,903 gas stations in
West Germany. Officials said the operation could fetch as much as
$1.7 billion.
   Texaco previously announced plans to sell 60 million barrels of
U.S. oil and natural gas reserves.
   Kinnear said in a statement issued from Texaco's headquarters in
White Plains, N.Y., that the asset sales would serve to
``de-emphasize our presence in manufacturing and marketing.''
   He said the company also would ``pursue rigorous programs to
streamline management and to set and achieve strict operating and
financial objectives.''
   Under a reorganization plan approved March 23 by a federal
bankruptcy court judge, Texaco transferred $3 billion to Pennzoil
on April 7 to settle its 4-year legal battle with the Houston-based
company.
   Texaco had filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter
11 of federal bankruptcy laws to avoid having to post a potentially
ruinous multibillion-dollar security bond while appealing a $10
billion damage judgment awarded to Pennzoil by a Houston jury in
November 1985. The award stemmed from Texaco's acquisition of Getty
Oil Co. after Getty had agreed to sell part of its assets to
Pennzoil.
   Also at the board meeting, former PPG Industries Inc. Chairman
L. Stanton Williams was elected to the board of directors to
replace Elvis Mason, who resigned. Mason is the managing partner of
Mason Best Co., a privately held merchant banking company based in
Dallas.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed on New Economic Data, Gold Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed mixed against major foreign
currencies Friday amid speculation that interest rates would soon
rise.
   Gold prices increased. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a bid of $455.25 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from
$452.65 late Thursday.
   The government's announcement of a 0.6 percent increase in
wholesale prices for March was viewed as mildly bullish and had a
stabilizing influence on the dollar, said Dan Holland, a trader at
Discount Corp.
   Traders believed the Federal Reserve might be moved to tighten
credit _ thereby raising interest rates _ to counter a surge in
inflation.
   Higher interest rates would have a calming effect on the dollar,
which fell sharply on Thursday after the government released
disappointing balance of trade figures.
   Another government report Friday, of a 0.1 percent in industrial
production, produced market speculation that companies were buying
foreign machinery to increase their output, Holland said. Traders
believe higher output would lead to increased exports, and
eventually a shrinkage in the nation's trade deficit.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday the deficit widened to
$13.8 billion in February. Financial markets had expected the gap
to narrow.
   Holland described trading Friday as quiet.
   In Europe, the dollar fell, but central bank intervention
tempered its slide, dealers said.
   While American markets interpreted Friday's economic figures as
positive for the dollar, overseas traders saw them in a negative
light and sold dollars. The wholesale price figure was larger than
expected and the industrial output number was lower than
anticipated.
   In Tokyo, where trading ended before the figures were released,
the dollar fell 2.02 yen to a closing 124.13. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 123.90 yen and in New York, it rose to 123.80 yen
from 123.725 yen late Thursday.
   In London, it cost $1.8890 to buy one pound, higher than $1.8755
Thursday. In later New York trading, sterling rose to $1.9003 from
$1.8739.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's prices, included: 1.66095 West German marks, down from
1.66275; 1.3725 Swiss francs, up from 1.3720; 5.6345 French francs,
up from 5.6325; 1,232.625 Italian lire, down from 1,233.00; and
1.2333 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2365.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday: 1.6605
West German marks, down from 1.6635; 1.3720 Swiss francs, down from
1.3745; 5.6325 French francs, down from 5.6390; 1.8630 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.8680; 1,232.50 Italian lire, down from
1,244.00; and 1.2335 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2368.
   Gold rose on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at
$455.90 a troy ounce, compared with $452.65 late Thursday.
   In London, bullion rose to a late bid price of $456.25 an ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $451. In Zurich, gold was higher,
closing at a bid $455.50 an ounce, compared with $450.50 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $5.45 to close at a bid $454.93
an ounce.
   Silver rose on the Comex in New York. It closed at $6.455 a troy
ounce, up from $6.325 late Thursday.
   Silver also rose on the London market where the metal was
trading at a late bid price of $6.49 an ounce, compared with
Thursday's $6.43.

   Oil prices continued to advance Friday in light
trading, reaching the highest levels since December.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May-delivery price for
West Texas Intermediate crude, which closed up 18 cents per barrel
Thursday, rose another 7 cents to $18.37. It was the highest since
a Dec. 11 close of $18.31 per 42-gallon barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heating
oil rose .24 cent a gallon to 49.75 cents after a 0.49 cent rise
Thursday, and wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.25 cent a gallon
to 52.61 cents after falling .06 cent Thursday.
   Traders said Friday's gains were based largely on internal
market influences rather than any outside news.
   ``What you have today is more of an absence of sellers rather
than any aggressive buying,'' said Jayne Ball, a trader in the
energy futures department at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
   Prices have advanced recently in response to plans for a meeting
of oil producers from inside and outside the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries on April 23.
   Gains also had been spurred Thursday by investors who dumped
stocks as the market tumbled in response to the Commerce
Department's disappointing report on U.S. trade.

<HEAD>Inflation Shows First Jump of Year in March Wholesale Prices</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 6th graf, The Dow ..., to UPDATE with closing figure. A
version moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation got its first big dose of inflation
this year as wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 7 percent
in March, the government said Friday. The report sent new tremors
through financial markets already shaken by a worsening U.S. trade
deficit.
   The Labor Department's producer price index rose 0.6 percent
last month, marking the biggest increase since April 1987 and more
than erasing a 0.2 percent decline in February.
   Falling energy and food prices that had been keeping a lid on
inflationary pressures shot upwards in March, as did wholesale
prices for a wide marketbasket of other consumer goods and capital
equipment.
   The price data provided the followup blow in a one-two punch
that government statisticians delivered on the state of the economy.
   On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that the nation's
trade deficit expanded by $1.4 billion or 11 percent to $13.8
billion in February when all predictions had called for it to
narrow.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue-chip stocks dropped
101 points on the news Thursday _ its fifth biggest decline in
history _ but the market stabilized Friday and the Dow closed up
8.29 points.
   ``I don't know that the markets are going to digest two doses of
really quite bad medicine too quickly,'' said Donald Straszheim,
chief economist for Merrill Lynch brokerage.
   ``The trade number is easier to explain away because it bounces
up and down, but not the price figures,'' Straszheim said. ``The 2
percent and 3 percent inflation we have been enjoying _ we probably
will no longer.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
was disappointed by the increase in wholesale prices and the trade
deficit.
   ``We think the market has overreacted to a one-time report, and
we hope this thing will stabilize,'' he said.
   But analysts said upward pressure on prices is only going to
worsen in the months ahead, stirring speculation that the Federal
Reserve Board might tighten credit to both prevent the dollar from
losing further value and dampen inflation.
   The Fed last raised the discount rate it charges for loans to
banks in September 1987. A month later the stock market collapsed
with the Dow Industrials dropping 518 points, partly in reaction to
higher interest rates from the credit tightening.
   Lawrence Hunter, an economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
expressed fears Friday that the Fed will ``overreact to perceived
inflationary pressures that some see in the recent data'' and
stymie economic growth
   ``Oversteering in the face of monthly price swings can only feed
fears of inflation,'' Hunter said, referring to figures that show
the annual wholesale price increases of just 3.1 percent when
averaged over the past three months.
   However, Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia State University economist
who specializes in wholesale price trends, said increases in April
will match, if not exceed, those in March.
   ``This isn't a one-month aberration,'' Ratajczak said. ``Strong
increases in raw material prices that have been going on for six
months are widening and spreading. It's not runaway inflation, but
it's a little worrying.''
   Wholesale energy prices, which had dropped at an annual rate of
17 percent since last August, shot up 0.9 percent in March.
Gasoline prices climbed 1.5 percent last month after dropping about
9 percent since November. And home heating oil prices jumped 2.6
percent.
   Food prices, after dropping 1.1 percent in February, advanced by
0.7 percent in March. For the first three months of the year, beef
and veal prices have climbed 43.6 percent.
   Reflecting the broad nature of March's price gains, the Labor
Department said its index of wholesale prices for consumer goods
other than food and energy rose 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.3
percent increase in February.
   For the first three months of 1988, those non-energy, non-food
wholesale prices are up at an annual rate of 5.7 percent.
   Automobile prices were up 1 percent last month, restoring them
to the level they had been at in November before manufacturers
began offering rebates and other incentives.
   Prescription drug prices rose 1.3 percent, over-the-counter
drugs were up 2 percent and the price of newspapers climbed 1.4
percent in March. Other goods showing 1 percent or greater price
increases one step short of the retail level included carpeting,
draperies and jewelry.
   Capital equipment prices rose 0.4 percent, double the increases
of January and February. The biggest price gains _ above 1 percent
_ were in metal-cutting machine tools and office and store
equipment.
   In a related report, the Commerce Department said Friday that
businesses planning to increase their capital spending by 8 percent
this year after raising it by only 1.7 percent in 1987.
   The Commerce report reflected increasing optimistism about the
economy among businessman who, when last surveyed in December, said
they planned to increase their capital spending by 7.3 percent this
year.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial
production edged up just 0.1 percent in March. Analysts said that
report was the only indication that the economy is not overheating
following a long string of data suggesting that it is.
   As for wholesale prices, the March gain brought the producer
price index to 106.2. That means a selection of good costing $100
at the wholesale level in 1982 would have cost $106.20 last month,
or 30 cents more than in February.
   Wholesale prices rose only 2.2 percent for all of 1987. The
index, however, does not include two categories where price
increases have been more pronounced in recent months _ services and
imports.
   Those two categories are included in the consumer price index,
which rose 4.4 percent last year.
   Consumer prices for the first two months of 1988 were running at
an annual rate of 3.2 percent. Figures on retail price activity in
March will be released later this month.

<HEAD>Stevens Board Backs Odyssey Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sheet and towel giant J.P. Stevens & Co. said
Friday its board has backed a $1.22 billion buyout bid from a New
York investment firm, spurning a lower offer from rival fabric
maker West Point-Pepperell Inc.
   In the continuing takeover battle for the textile giant, Odyssey
Partners was offering $68.50 a share in cash for Stevens'
outstanding shares under a tender offer due to expire April 22.
   The company sweetened its offer to that level in a frenzied
auction Monday, just hours after Pepperell boosted its own tender
offer to $67 a share in cash, or about $1.19 billion. The current
bids represent the third time each company has sweetened its bid
for Stevens.
   Stevens fell 50 cents a share to close at $67.62{ Friday in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   In recommending that shareholders tender to Odyssey, Stevens
said its board had considered and rejected Pepperell's competing
offer.
   Joseph L. Lanier Jr., Pepperell's chairman and chief executive
officer, had said in an interview he considered Pepperell's current
bid fair, but he did not rule out another round of bidding.
   A spokesman for Pepperell had no comment on what action the
company might take.
   The board's decision to spurn Pepperell came after the West
Point, Ga., company was able to remove major antitrust concerns by
agreeing with the Federal Trade Commission to sell certain Stevens
assets if its offer succeeds.
   Pepperell said earlier in the week that the FTC agreed to permit
Pepperell's previously announced plans to sell half of Stevens'
bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines for about $170 million
to NTC Group, parent of the textile manufacturer Bibb Co.
   The FTC also waived waiting requirements under federal
disclosure laws but could require Pepperell to sell a sheeting
mill, a yarn plant, certain designer licenses and a brand name if
the deal were consummated, Pepperell said.
   The FTC would have six months to decide whether Pepperell must
divest those Stevens assets.
   Among the top brand names in Stevens towel and sheet arsenal are
Ralph Lauren, Laura Ashley, Gloria Vanderbilt, Perry Ellis, Pierre
Cardin, and Givenchy, among others. Pepperell's brands include
Arrow, Martex, Lady Pepperell and Burberry.
   Bidding for Stevens began after it received a leveraged buyout
offer earlier this year from a group led by its own senior
management, including Chairman Whitney Stevens, a fifth-generation
member of the family that founded the company in 1813.
   Pepperell launched a $62.50-a-share tender offer last month
after Stevens agreed to a buyout by Odyssey at $61.50 a share.
Odyssey subsequently sweetened its offer to $64.
   On Monday, Pepperell increased its tender offer to $67 a share,
but Odyssey topped that by $1.50 a share just hours before its own
tender was about to expire.

   Stock prices pulled out of Thursday's steep
slide with an uneven showing Friday marked by strength in some
blue-chip issues.
   But analysts said investors' spirits were still dampened by
worries over inflation and the nation's international trade
problems.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 101.46 on Thursday
for its fifth largest point loss ever, rose 8.29 to 2,013.93. It
finished the week with a net loss of 76.26 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 5 in the
daily tally on the New York Stock Exchange, with 573 up, 990 down
and 420 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 234.16 million shares, up from 211.81
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index slipped
.14 to 147.00.
   Analysts said blue-chip stocks attracted some buying by traders
looking for ``bargains'' after the big drop on Thursday.
   But they also noted that stocks faced some formidable obstacles
in any bid to rebound.
   The Labor Department reported Friday morning that the producer
price index of finished goods rose 0.6 percent in March. That put
added emphasis on recent worries about a possible revival of
inflationary pressures.
   At the same time, interest rates rose in the credit markets,
pushing yields on long-term Treasury bonds close to the 8.95
percent level.
   Brokers said the bond and stock markets were still feeling the
ill effects of the unexpected news Thursday that the nation's trade
deficit widened in February.
   Gainers among the blue chips that contributed to the Dow Jones
industrials' gain included International Business Machines, up 2}
at 114[, and Texaco, up 1} at 48|.
   Earlier this week, IBM reported a first-quarter earnings gain
that drew high marks from most analysts.
   Texaco, which recently emerged from bankruptcy protection, voted
a 75-cents-a-share quarterly dividend and expanded the plans for
its restructuring program.
   Other big-name issues attracting buyers included General Motors,
up 1[ at 72}; Procter & Gamble, up 1 at 78~, and Sears Roebuck, up
~ at 34~.
   Digital Equipment, by contrast, fell 1| to 101{, hitting a new
52-week low. The company, with a very large following among
investing institutions, recently reported first-quarter earnings
that were essentially flat against comparable year-ago figures.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $1.06 billion, or 0.04
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 265.05 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose .36 to 302.68, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up .02 at 259.77.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped .62 to 373.90. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 299.24, up .32.

   The biggest rise in wholesale prices in 11
months sent new inflation jitters through the financial markets
Friday, but stock prices stabilized a day after a $100 billion drop.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.29 points to
2,013.93 after plunging 101.46 points on Thursday. Stocks also
dipped in foreign markets and interest rates rose, but the dollar
stabilized.
   In spite of the Dow Jones increase, declining issues outnumbered
advancing ones by about 9 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The Labor Department raised inflation worries with its report
that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.6 percent in
March, an annual rate for wholesale inflation of more than 7
percent.
   Investors had already been worried about inflation because of
Thursday's report that the merchandise trade deficit jumped
unexpectedly to $13.8 billion in February.
   The big trade gap signaled to some investors that an overheated
economy was sucking in too many imports. The report also threatened
to fuel inflation by knocking down the dollar, which would boost
import prices.
   In spite of the wholesale inflation report, the fear that drove
prices down Thursday was largely absent from the markets on Friday.
   ``There's a bit of concern in the producer price number but not
anything great,'' said Lincoln Anderson, an economist for Bear,
Stearns & Co.
   Investors realized that the big jumps in food and energy costs
that swelled the index in March were probably only temporary,
Anderson said.
   Interest rates rose Friday as traders speculated the Federal
Reserve would try to wring inflation expectations out of the market
by tightening credit and slowing down the economy.
   Tightening by the Fed would push up interest rates in the short
term but pave the way for them to decline over the longer term by
easing fears of an overheated economy.
   Some economists worried that the Fed would accidentally knock
the economy into recession by trying too hard to cool things off.
   ``What's absolutely amazing to me is that last fall all the
experts were looking for recession and depression, and that was
bad. Here, 180 days later, a strong economy is (seen as) bad,''
said Neil Eigen, senior vice president of Integrated Resources
Asset Management, a New York money management firm.
   The yield of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond continued to
rise to 8.94 percent by midafternoon Friday, a new three-month
high, up from 8.86 percent Thursday.
   The dollar bobbed within a narrow range after falling 2 percent
Thursday against the Japanese yen, West German mark and British
pound. Traders said major central banks bought dollars to support
the currency for a second day.
   Overseas Friday, key indexes fell less than 1 percent on the
Tokyo and London stock exchanges.
   The Dow industrials had climbed nearly 130 points from April 5
through Tuesday, largely on anticipation that February's trade news
would be favorable.
   The value of U.S. stocks fell by $99.7 billion in Thursday's
plunge, according to a 5,000-stock index measured by Wilshire
Associates of Santa Monica, Calif. Stocks fell an additional $1
billion in Friday, the organization said.

<HEAD>Knight-Ridder Amends Its `Poison Pill' Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Inc. said Friday that its board of
directors amended a shareholders' rights ``poison pill'' plan to a
make it even tougher for a hostile takeover of the media giant.
   The board also authorized a stock buyout of up to 5 million
common shares, four months after it approved the purchase of up to
2 million shares. Spokesman Frank Hawkins said the stock was needed
for several reasons, including employee share and option plans.
   More than 40 percent of Knight-Ridder stock is owned or
controlled by directors, officers, employees or founding families.
   Under the poison pill amendment, shareholders would be able to
buy additional common shares at a discount should someone acquire
up to 20 percent of the company's outstanding stock, said Hawkins.
   ``The effect of that is to make a hostile takeover attempt
extremely dilutive,'' he said.
   Meanwhile Friday, Knight-Ridder President James K. Batten, 52,
was elected chief executive officer. Batten, a 31-year veteran
newsman of Knight-Ridder, replaces Alvah H. Chapman Jr., 67, who
remains as chairman.
   Knight-Ridder publishes 30 daily newspapers, including the Miami
Herald and the Philadelphia Inquirer, owns and operates eight
television stations and is a joint venture partner in cable
television and newsprint manufacturing operations. It also owns
49.5 percent of The Seattle Times.

<HEAD>Soybeans Plunge On Poor Export Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices plunged as much as 16 cents a bushel
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid heavy selling prompted by
a dismal outlook for export sales, analysts said. Grain futures
also retreated.
   On other markets, cattle futures finished higher after reversing
sharp losses; pork futures moved lower; oil futures advanced for
the fifth straight day; precious metals and stock-index futures
posted slight gains.
   Soybeans declined on a combination of bearish fundamentals,
including good harvest weather for the South American soybean crop,
disappointing export sales last week and relatively high cash
prices for soybeans and soybean products, analysts said.
   ``We're just way out of whack with prices for cottonseed meal
and corn,'' making soybeans less attractive on the world market,
said Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   The government released grain export sales figures Thursday for
the week ending April 7, showing shipments of both soybeans and
soybean meal were down about 60 percent from the previous week.
   The rally last week that pushed new-crop soybean futures well
above $7 a bushel likely persuaded more farmers to plant soybeans,
another bearish factor, said Joel Karlin, an analyst for
Chicago-based Research Department Inc.
   Analysts said Chicago-based C&D Commodities, the largest
speculative firm on the floor, led the decline by selling large
numbers of contracts for soybeans and soybean products that it had
purchased in recent weeks.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 3} cents lower with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.12} a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 2{ cents
lower with May at $2.02} a bushel; oats were { cent to 1{ cents
lower with May at $1.60 a bushel; soybeans were 13 cents to 16
cents lower with May at $6.62{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures rode a roller coaster on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange with the contract for April delivery falling to 72.50
cents a pound, then rallying to settle at 73.97 cents, 15 points
above Thursday's settlement.
   Traders were counting on Friday's lower wholesale beef prices
and forecasts for warmer weather to spark a resurgence of retail
buying for outdoor cookouts, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst in
Chicago for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``The abiltiy of the market to shake off its early severe losses
today indicated anticipation of better retail business next week,''
he said.
   The lower prices for pork futures reflected concerns about the
week's unusually high slaughter numbers, Levitt said.
   ``There is no sign of a seasonal letup in supplies,'' he said.
``Until we start to see the marketings subside, the market will
struggle with the large production.''
   Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .37 cent higher with April
at 73.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .30
cent higher with April at 79.67 cents a pound; hogs were .32 cent
lower to .07 cent higher with April at 44.70 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .03 cent lower to .90 cent higher with May at
52.05 cents a pound.
   Crude-oil futures advanced for the fifth straight day on the New
York Mercantile Exchange on expectations that OPEC and non-OPEC
countries will agree to limit oil production when they meet in a
session tentatively scheduled for April 26.
   Some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries appear unwilling to cut their production, but the market
has so far ignored those bearish signals, said Michael Rothman,
senior oil analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 8 cents
higher with May at $18.37 a barrel; heating oil was .24 cent to .43
cent higher with May at 49.75 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.25 cent to .33 cent higher with May at 52.61 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures advanced on New York's Commodity Exchange in quiet
trading following the government's release of a report showing a
0.6 percent rise in wholesale prices last month. Silver was nearly
unchanged.
   The market was expecting an increase of about 0.3 percent in
wholesale prices, and analysts had expected the inflationary
implications of a greater rise to send gold prices soaring.
   Gold settled $1.90 to $2.80 higher with June at $458.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 1 cent higher with May at $6.475 a
troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures posted slight gains on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 0.4 point higher at 258.80.

   Bond prices tumbled and interest rates jumped
Friday for the second consecutive session as new worries emerged
about inflation.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell | point, or
$6.25 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
inversely to its price, climbed to 8.94 percent from 8.86 percent
late Thursday.
   The 30-year bond dropped about $10 for every $1,000 in face
value moments after the government reported wholesale prices jumped
0.6 percent in March _ the biggest increase in 11 months.
   But prices later recoverered as buyers appeared when yields on
the longest issues edged closer to 9 percent, a height last touched
in January.
   The latest price decline came on the heels of Thursday's sharp
slide in stock and bond prices sparked by news of an unexpected
widening in the U.S. trade deficit.
   Most analysts had been looking for a more moderate gain in
wholesale prices than the 0.6 percent rise reported by the
government.
   ``It catered to the market's recent fears about whether the
economy is expanding too rapidly, and is facing demand pressures
and bottlenecks that would tend to move prices higher,'' said
William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research for the
investment fir Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities, and
increases the chances that the Federal Reserve Board will encourage
higher interest rates to curb rising prices.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
issues fell [ point, intermediates lost 5-16 point and 20-year
governments fell } point, according to the financial information
service Telerate Inc.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, had declined 0.42 to 110.83. The Shearson Lehman
composite index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 3.76 at
1,159.06.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, fell 0.98 to 278.90.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, soared 17 basis
points to 5.89 percent, while six-month bills jumped 19 basis
points to 6.22 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a
percentage point. One-year bills jumped 12 basis points to 6.58
percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 6} percent, up from 611-16 percent late
Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyers Municipal Bond Index
of 40 long-term bonds fell 11-32 point to 8718-32 while its yield
rose to 8.21 percent from 8.17 percent.

   World finance leaders wrapped up a tumultuous
meeting of the International Monetary Fund on Friday with more
words of assurance to nervous financial markets and further efforts
to rescue the U.S. dollar.
   The semi-annual meeting of the 151-nation IMF was dominated by
the dollar's steep plunge after four months of relative stability.
   In an effort to brake the nosedive, the United States and its
allies launched a multimillion-dollar intervention effort, selling
off their reserves of Japanese yen, German marks and other
currencies and buying dollars.
   The intervention, while doing little to slow the dollar's
descent on Thursday, met with more success on Friday amid reports
of further dollar purchases by the United States, West Germany and
Britain.
   The dollar declined against the yen on markets in Tokyo and
Europe but rallied later in the day in New York trading to close at
123.8 yen, up from 123.7 yen late Thursday.
   Still, the dollar's rout shattered the optimistic tone the
finance ministers had hoped to impart in their first high-level
discussions since the Oct. 19 stock market collapse.
   The dollar's plunge came less than 18 hours after the world's
seven largest industrial economies _ the United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy _ had issued a glowing
appraisal of the world economy.
   The so-called Group of Seven bragged in a joint communique
Wednesday that they had successfully stabilized the dollar since
pledging to do so on Dec. 22 and reaffirmed their commitment to
intervene in currency markets when necessary to keep the dollar
stable.
   Instead of focusing on the words of optimism, financial markets
the next day were stampeded into a frantic dollar selloff following
news that the U.S. trade deficit widened to a disappointing $13.8
billion in February.
   Administration sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed Friday that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III held a
hasty 10-minute conference with finance ministers from Japan and
West Germany and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to discuss
the dollar selloff.
   Japan and West Germany have supplied the largest amount of
reserves to buy dollars. Currency traders estimated that on
Thursday alone the amount of intervention totaled as much as $700
million. Sources said the intervention continued Friday.
   Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson told reporters he found
it encouraging that the markets had settled down somewhat on Friday
following the intervention effort, which he termed a success.
   ``I think the reaction Thursday was one of surprise, but we all
realize that the trade figures are erratic and as people reflected
on that, things calmed down,'' Wilson said.
   Dutch Finance Minister H. Onno Ruding, who heads the IMF's
policymaking committee, said the market turmoil came up in the
discussions, but he said that there was no undue concern.
   ``Members were aware of the development in the markets (during
their closed-door session Thursday), but it has not changed
dramatically the actions of our meetings,'' Ruding said. ``We are
trying to improve the (world economic) system regardless of the
vagaries of the market from day to day.''
   Ruding said the finance ministers decided against making any
alterations in their assessment of global growth prospects. The
group's final communique on Friday predicted continued growth for
the world economy this year at a ``steady, moderate'' pace.
   The joint session of the IMF and the World Bank also addressed
Third World debt problems, although no major new initiatives were
unveiled.
   World Bank President Barber Conable, in a speech Friday, said
the overriding issue facing the two lending organizations was the
need to reduce the poor countries' debt burden, which is estimated
to total $1.245 trillion at the end of this year.
   Nigel Lawson, British chancellor of the exchequer, said one
thing that would help would be a reduction in the interest rates
the poor countries are being charged on their loans.
   ``All of us know that there is no way in which the poorest
countries can meet their interest payments,'' he said. ``The
interest burden thus mounts exponentially and the poorest countries
are thus caught in a vicious circle.''

<HEAD>Mill Closed, 400 Laid Off; Company Suspects Sabotage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOODLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Georgia-Pacific Corp. has suspended
operations at its pulp and paper mill here and temporarily laid off
400 employees while repairs are made to equipment that company
officials said Friday may have been sabotaged.
   The closing follows a weeklong shutdown at a Georgia-Pacific
mill in Vermont because of what the company also termed apparent
acts of sabotage.
   Labor leaders have denied union involvment in the incidents at
both mills.
   The Woodland mill was shut down Thursday after a maintenance
employee discovered two pounds of sand blasting shot in the gear
box and lube system of a paper pulp washer in the bleaching plant,
mill manager Jerry Robinson said.
   ``The machine has just been destroyed,'' spokeswoman Beth
Zoffmann said from the company's headquarters in Atlanta. ``If we
can't make bleached pulp, we can't make any paper. And we can't
make any bleached pulp.''
   Robinson said the mill would remain closed and the 400 hourly
workers laid off indefinitely while the washer is repaired and an
investigation conducted into other areas of the mill.
   Company officials said the pulp washer was ``apparently
sabotaged,'' and Maine State Police detectives have been called in
to conduct a criminal investigation, Lt. John Whynott said.
   Zoffmann said she did not know who might have tampered with the
equipment, which was located in an area accessible to all
employees. She also declined to say if the incident was related to
stalled contract negotiations.
   There is ``no evidence to indicate that it is,'' she said. ``I
guess it would be speculation'' to say the union was involved.
   Jimmy Dinardo, vice president of the United Paperworkers
International Union in New England, said he did not believe union
members were responsible.
   ``The international does not condone anything like sabotage,''
he said. ``And I don't believe the company has proof of anything
like that.''
   Labor negotiations, under way since July between
Georgia-Pacific, the UPIU and several smaller trade unions, have
been stalled and no date has been set to resume the talks. The
unions have been working without a contract since August.
   Among the sticking points are the union's demands for premium
pay on Sundays, as well as the company's desire for more
flexibility in assigning jobs and the opportunity to keep the mill
open on holidays. Management of the pension fund has also been an
issue.
   This is not the first time equipment has been damaged at the
mill and the cause attributed to sabotage. In September, another
machine in the bleaching plant was found damaged during a regularly
scheduled maintenance shutdown. Zoffmann said no one was found at
fault in that incident and the investigation is continuing.
   In Vermont, the Georgia-Pacific paper mill in Gilman was shut
down April 6-13 because of what the company termed apparent acts of
sabotage. Zoffmann said 185 workers, including 140 union employees,
were sent home while police began an investigation into the dumping
of dye in a vat of wallpaper stock.
   Police also are investigating an April 3 fire that damaged a
garage and two vehicles at the Littleton, N.H., home of the Gilman
mill's personnel manager.
   Workers at the Gilman mill have been without a contract for six
months and authorities in Vermont have questioned whether the
incidents are labor-related. Union members have emphatically denied
any connection.

<HEAD>Former Xerox Employees Charge Age Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for some 1,300 former Xerox Corp.
employees, claiming they lost their jobs because of age
discrimination, asked a federal appeals court Friday to allow them
to sue for damages in a class action.
   The case has bounced around the federal court system for five
years and now it has bounced back to the Third U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, where two judges said they were troubled that a lower
court, without considering statistical evidence, had decertified a
class of victims of an alleged pattern or practice of age
discrimination.
   According to briefs filed in the case, Xerox terminated, forced
to retire or denied promotion to at least 1,300 people between May
1980 and April 1983 in order to reduce its work force. The lower
court held they were not part of a class action because they had
different jobs and different risks.
   ``That is error,'' said Attorney Robert Dietz, representing 13
former salesmen of Xerox facsimile devices who brought the appeal
seeking to reinstate a 1984 order by the U.S. District Court in New
Jersey that had created a conditional class.
   After nearly an hour of oral argument, Judges William
Hutchinson, Max Rosenn and Anthony Scirica took the case under
advisement.
   A decision is not expected until sometime this summer.
   Robert Jaffe, another lawyer representing the employees, said:
``We are fighting the procedural barriers erected by a
well-financed firm who have consistently denied that the reduction
in force imposed by Xerox targeted older workers even though the
evidence we provided conclusively supports it.''
   ``You say the lower court failed to consider the statistical
evidence, or even company documents (that supported it), when it
denied a class action designation?'' asked Rosenn.
   ``Right,'' responded Jaffe. ``We ask you to instruct the trial
court to consider that. We say Xerox conducted fraud on its older
workers. The undisputed facts of discrimination come from the
company's own records. What the lower court did was a clear error
of law.''
   Attorney Robert Del Tufo, representing Xerox, disagreed, and
contended that charges of discrimination must be proved,
separately, by each claimant.
   Rosenn interjected that ``what troubles me is that in the
District Court opinion there is no discussion of the evidence.''
   Hutchinson said he, too, ``was troubled (because the judge)
didn`t say what he found, and that appears to be clear error.''
   Rosenn added, ``He ignored the statistical evidence, and said it
wasn't relevant. Should he have disregarded it? That's what we have
to decide.''
   Del Tufo argued that ``the statistical evidence is wrong, and is
irrelevant.''
   The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in a friend
of the court brief, noted: ``It is difficult to prove specific acts
of discrimination'' and that ``statistics may often be the only
available evidence of clandestine and covert discrimination.''
   It joined the plaintiffs in asking that the class be certified
contending that the lower court ``committed legal error.''

   Larry Speakes said in a television interview
after the October stock market crash that his job as White House
spokesman had taught him the value of truthfulness.
   Speakes, who joined Merrill Lynch & Co. as vice president of
communications last year after his departure from Washington,
resigned Friday because of an uproar over his disclosure that he
had invented quotes for President Reagan.
   In an appearance on the syndicated television show, The Wall
Street Journal Report, on Oct. 29, Speakes said there is ``no
substitute for the truth in a crisis.''
   ``In a crisis, as I found out previously, the thing you want to
do is get to as many people as you can with the facts, to give them
the story and the truth,'' he said on the broadcast.
   He was responding to a question about post-crash Merrill Lynch
advertisements, which had been criticized as overly optimistic
about the outlook for stocks.

<HEAD>Union Says FAA Safety Checks Sideline 10 Eastern Jets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD W. SWINTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of Eastern Airlines planes sidelined
with safety violations grew to at least 10 Friday, as a federal
crackdown found problems including a fuel leak, a missing
maintenance log and a cracked wing flap, the Machinists union said.
   The airline and the Federal Aviation Administration refused to
confirm the number, saying they have stopped detailing the
violations.
   ``They didn't want to see a running box score,'' said FAA
spokesman John Leyden. ``We'll summerize it at the end of the
inspection.''
   Four more planes were found to have safety violations Friday,
according to a Machinists official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``They're calling in from around the country,'' the official
said of machinists supplying their union with information after the
FAA stopped making it public.
   Meanwhile, Machinists union President Charles E. Bryan put out a
bulletin to Eastern's 12,000 machinists urging them to report
thoroughly on threats some employees have said they received from
management after they spoke voluntarily with FAA inspectors.
   The latest temporary groundings were in Boston, St. Louis,
Tallahassee and Atlanta, the unidentified union official said.
   In Boston, Flight 945, an A-300 AirBus, was sidelined at 9 a.m.
EDT Friday with a wing flap dent and a fuel leak in an engine. The
plane was fixed by 12:30 p.m., the official said.
   A second St. Louis flight was held for repairs Friday morning,
the official said. Flight 465, a 727 to Miami, was found to have a
cracked wing flap. Late Thursday, Flight 267, a DC-9 bound for
Atlanta, was taken out of service after FAA inspectors found it
lacked a flight maintenance log and was missing landing bumper pads.
   The battery relay switch on a DC-9 was found not to be working
in Tallahassee. The switch turns on the plane's electrical
equipment, the official said.
   The tenth plane was a DC-9 taken out of service when inspectors
discovered a duct in the tail section was overheating, the official
said.
   The four Friday groundings were in addition to six the FAA
reported on Thursday.
   Leyden said about 20 percent of the EAL 267-plane fleet had been
looked over by FAA inspectors in 23 cities when the agency stopped
reporting its findings Friday morning. Inspections were expected to
continue as flights arrived in those cities during the 30-day
review that began Wednesday.
   Eastern officials have refused to reveal the number of safety
violations found in their fleet.
   Eastern spokewoman Karen Ceremsak said news of the sidelined
planes was being overblown. She noted that some of mechanical
problems occurred daily and were fixed.
   However, a Minneapolis-Atlanta flight that Eastern had cleared
for takeoff was emptied of passengers and sidelined Thursday
because of a fuel leak, NBC News reported.
   In addition to the planes stopped Friday, the
Minneapolis-Atlanta and St. Louis flights, DC-9s and 727s were
sidelined in Miami, New York and Rochester, N.Y.
   The inspection of all Eastern planes began after the FAA slapped
the company with a $823,000 fine for safety violations. U.S.
Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said officials have been
unsatisfied with Eastern's performance since its 1986 takeover by
Texas Air Corp., which also will undergo a 30-day inspection of its
operating practices.

<HEAD>Closing Arguments Heard In West Publishing Case</HEAD>

   Two computerized legal research services
squared off in federal court Friday for closing arguments in a
two-week copyright infringement trial a defense lawyer called a
case of ``the emperor's new clothes.''
   West Publishing Co. filed suit against one of its competitors in
1985, alleging copyright infringement. West, based in St. Paul,
accused Mead Corp. and Mead Data Central of illegally using West's
copyright material in Lexis, their computerized legal research
service.
   MDC, which distributes Lexis, is a subsidiary of Mead Corp., a
paper products manufacturer based in Dayton, Ohio.
   ``A case of the `emperor's new clothes' is how I referred to
this in my opening statement,'' Mead lawyer David C. Greer told the
court. ``The arrangements in this case are nothing more than legal
finery which have been rigged up by some tailor.''
   Last year, Mead sued West, claiming that West is an illegal
monopoly. West also has filed an antitrust suit against Mead,
bringing to three the number of lawsuits in which the two are
engaged.
   The copyright infringement trial, heard by U.S. District Judge
James Rosenbaum, is part of an 11-count complaint. The remaining 10
counts will be resolved by judicial order once Rosenbaum issues his
ruling on the copyright issue.
   West's National Reporter System publishes judicial opinions for
every state and federal court, and the company's Key Number Index
System organizes and classifies case law.
   West asks that Mead and Mead Data Central be permanently
enjoined from continuing to copy West's materials and that the
court impound and destroy all infringing materials.
   ``Mead took (our materials). They knew it. And they expected to
derive great revenue from it,'' West lawyer Vance K. Opperman
argued. ``We have both the right to copy and the right to display.
Both have been infringed.''
   But Mead claims there's been no infringement because West is not
entitled to a copyright.
   ``In no case does copyright protection from an original work or
authority extend to an idea ... And if we have anything here, all
we have is an idea or concept,'' Greer argued.
   Greer said Mead only wanted to make ``fair use'' of the
materials and should have access to them.
   ``West, I submit, confused access to the law with access to West
books ... But West doesn't own the law,'' Greer said.
   Opperman argued that West's system reflects originality and is
therefore protected by copyright.
   ``This is the product of great intellectual effort, great
creativity,'' Opperman said.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks Koppers Takeover</HEAD>

   A federal judge Friday blocked investors led
by Britain's Brian C. Beazer from proceeding with a $1.7 billion
hostile takeover of Koppers Co., but the judge left the door open
for Beazer to salvage the proposed deal.
   U.S. District Judge Maurice B. Cohill Jr. said that the novel
role played by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in the takeover
apparently requires the investment banking firm to file financial
disclosure statements just like any other bidder. Shearson did not
make the filings.
   Cohill said that ``since ... there is a great probability that
the defendants have violated the Williams Act,'' he was suspending
the takeover until a trial can be held or the violations in the
$60-per-share tender offer are corrected.
   The Williams Act is intended to prevent manipulation of the
stock markets.
   The Beazer group did not immediately indicate whether it would
appeal Cohill's order or attempt to correct the technical defects
and continue soliciting shares.
   The tender offer was due to expire at midnight Friday, but the
suitors are expected to extend the offer during the weekend.
   Beazer wants to combine his British and American holdings in
construction and building materials with the Pittsburgh-based
Koppers, a major U.S. producer of building materials and chemicals.
   Shearson maintained that its partial ownership of Beazer's
takeover company, BNS Inc., is merely an extension of traditional
lending practices in corporate acquisitions.
   ``The Shearson interests appear to be somewhat stealthily
pioneering the brave new world of equity financing,'' the judge
said in his 95-page opinion and order. ``As the legendary camel
once got his nose in the tent, intending to follow with its entire
body, so Shearson seems to be pursuing an agenda of its own.''
   Shearson's new approach prompted members of Congress to propose
legislation against the takeover and to call for investigations.
   Cohill said, ``this is a difficult case'' made all the more
complex by Shearson's ``quite novel'' role as
``broker-dealer-investment banker-adviser-owner.
   ``The facts are intricate and complicated; the law is fuzzy,''
he said.
   Cohill also said Beazer's plans to borrow $864 million from a
bank syndicate led by Citibank likely violate Federal Reserve Board
rules about posting stock as collateral on loans used to buy the
stock.
   The order is the second against the tender offer in a federal
court.
   A judge in Los Angeles has blocked it on antitrust grounds. The
U.S. 9th Circuirt Court of Appeals will hear arguments May 13 on
Beazer's attempt to overturn the Los Angeles ruling.
   Beazer's plans to sell Koppers' chemical operations stoked fears
of losing 1,100 jobs in Pittsburgh, and Cohill said the takeover
should be halted for now because ``the potential ramifications ...
to the Pittsburgh community are uncertain and possibly adverse.''
   In a countersuit, the Beazer group said Koppers's filings in
response to the tender offer also violated securities laws. But
Cohill said the tender offer apparently ``is invalid under federal
securities laws'' and ``until ... a valid tender offer is made,
Koppers is not obligated'' to file the proper disclosures.

<HEAD>GM Chairman Receives At Least $2.2 Million For 1987</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT time element in stock issuance.</NOTE>

   General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith
received at least $2.2 million for 1987 in salary, exercised stock
options and stock grants, the nation's largest automaker reported
Friday in its proxy statement.
   Smith received $867,000 in salary, earned $513,121 exercising
stock options and was awarded a stock bonus worth $800,000 when it
was granted on Dec. 7. The stock, issued in blocks over a
three-year period that began in January, is worth considerably more
now.
   GM President Robert Stempel received at least $1.2 million for
1987: $517,000 in salary, $73,523 on exercised stock options and
$600,000 in the stock bonus. Stempel became president in August,
when he replaced the retired F. James McDonald.
   In all, GM paid $13.6 million in 1987 salaries to its top 58
executives and gave stock awards worth $16.2 million on Dec. 7 and
$21.1 million on Friday to 4,961 executives.
   Ford Motor Co., the No. 2 automaker, paid $247.9 million in
bonuses for 1987 to 5,166 executives, it reported in a proxy
statement mailed Tuesday.
   Ford Vice Chairman Harold Poling earned nearly $11 million in
1987: $808,697 in salary, $2 million in cash bonuses and nearly
$8.1 million on exercised stock options.
   Ford Chairman Donald Petersen, who exercised no stock options,
received $2.8 million in cash bonuses and $929,934 in salary.
   GM's profit rose to $3.6 billion in 1987 from $2.95 billion in
1986, but for the second year in a row it earned too little on its
U.S. automaking business to pay profit-sharing to its 350,000
hourly U.S. workers.
   The outcry over the millions of dollars executives received in
bonuses for 1986 prompted GM's board of directors in 1987 to switch
to an all-stock bonus and spread each stock grant over several
years.
   United Auto Workers union President Owen Bieber and Vice
President Donald Ephlin said the 1987 compensation received by top
GM executives ``still can't be justified rationally and constitutes
an insult to common sense and fairness.''
   During a time when GM's automaking business is earning so
little, they said in a statement, ``we will leave the executives to
forego all increases and supplementary awards in the spirit of
shared sacrifice.''
   Ford distributed a record $636 million in profit-sharing checks
in March to more than 156,000 hourly and salaried employees, an
average of more than $4,000 each.
   On Friday, GM's common stock closed at $72.75 a share, up from
$71.62{. GM Class E stock, based on earnings of its Electronic Data
Systems Corp. subsidiary, declined to $41 a share from $41.62{.
   GM Class H stock, based on earnings of GM Hughes Electronics
Corp., closed at $30.25 a share, up from $30.
   When the stock bonuses were granted Dec. 7, GM common stock was
worth $56.19 a share, Class E stock was worth $31.19 a share and
Class H stock was worth $23.22 a share.
