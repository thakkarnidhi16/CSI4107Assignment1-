   Sikh gunmen opened fire with automatic
rifles and machine guns on a holiday gathering early Friday in
Punjab state, killing at least 32 people and injuring 40 others,
police said.
   The attack in Hoshiarpur district was one of the bloodiest since
Sikh extremists launched their guerrilla war for an independent
homeland in the northern state in 1982.
   Punjab security forces and New Delhi police were put on alert
after the killing to prevent any backlash by Hindus.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   Police said both Hindus and Sikhs were among those killed and
injured in the assault, which occurred as India began its
celebration of Holi, or the festival of color. The national holiday
commemorates the triumph of the Hindu god Lord Krishna over evil.
   Sikhs, who make up about 2 percent of India's 780 million
people, claim they are discriminated against by Hindus who form the
majority of the population. Punjab state is predominantly Sikh.
   The latest assault occurred as about 300 people gathered to
celebrate the festival at Kari Sari village near the town of
Hoshiarpur, which is about 80 miles east of the Sikh holy city of
Amritsar.
   Suresh Aurora, senior superintendent of police at Hoshiarpur,
said about 12 gunmen dashed onto the festival ground at about 12:30
a.m. Friday and opened fire.
   He said the injured, many of them in ``extremely serious''
condition, were rushed to hospitals in Hoshiarpur town and
Jalandhar, capital of the neighboring district.
   The gunmen fled and were being sought, he said.
   The attack was the worst in Punjab since last July, when Sikh
gunmen waylaid three buses in two attacks and slaughtered 72
people, most of them Hindus.
   The latest killings raised to more than 370 the number of people
killed in attacks blamed on Sikh extremists in Punjab since the
start of the year.
   Last year, more than 1,000 people died in such attacks.
   On Thursday, Sikh extremists had gunned down a Sikh family of
eight and a paramilitary policeman in Punjab.
   Sikhism is an offshoot of Hinduism that came into existence 500
years ago.
   Punjab has been under direct federal rule since Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi dismissed the moderate Sikh state government last year
for failing to curb terrorism.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the state health service in
virtual bankruptcy, Yugoslavia's Communist authorities are weighing
the possibility of using private medical practice on a large scale.
   Some medical associations already have resorted to private
practice in the republics of Slovenia and Serbia, partly because of
large losses built up by the state medical service.
   The official Tanjug news agency said authorities in Belgrade are
preparing a ``detailed analysis'' of private medicine and will
announce a decision by the end of May.
   Orthodox Communist Party dogma regards private medical practice
as unacceptable.
   But under consideration are the use of privately operating
doctors and small private clinics employing up to two physicians
plus medical staff.
   Yugoslavia's deepening economic crisis is the main reason for
the financial troubles in the state-run health service.
   A sharp drop in the value of Yugoslavia's currency, the dinar,
which lost about 200 percent against Western currencies in a year,
has driven up the cost of imports of many medicines, raw materials
for their production and medical equipment.
   In addition, a government price freeze has made the production
of such goods from imported raw materials unprofitable and has
resulted in a shortage of several medical and nutrition items,
including baby formula.
   In January, due to virtual lack of baby formula in several
Yugoslav hospitals, new-born babies had to be fed intravenouly.
   Private medical practice in Yugoslavia was abolished after World
War II when the Communist Party took power.
   The statea health service is financed by deductions from
Yugoslavs' salaries.
   However, since the state is unable to entirely subsidize health
care, most parts of Yugoslavia have permitted patients to pay for
medical services on a private basis.
   ``We cannot claim any more that our medical services are free of
charge, and this shows that we don't have the system typical of a
communist country,'' said Dr. Dragan Djordjevic, a Belgrade
physician.
   ``This means that the ideological barrier, which would prevent
introduction of private medical practice, no longer exists in
Yugoslavia.''
   In addition to shortages of medical supplies, the state health
service has been afflicted by a sharp drop in services and an
increasing number of work stoppages by medical staff over wages.
   The state-run press reported recent strikes by doctors and
nurses in Belgrade, Zagreb and Ljubljana.
   The lack of drugs and medical supplies, including such basic
items as soap, detergents and alcohol, has affected the work of
many hospitals, the newspaper Vecernje Novosti said recently.
   ``Hygiene has fallen to the lowest possible level, and even
disposable items have to be sterilized for multiple use,'' it said,
adding that patients are bringing their own soap to the hospital.
   Faced with a 170-percent inflation rate, a $20 billion foreign
debt and a sharp drop in living standards, Communist-governed
Yugoslavia has been hit by its worst economic crisis in its history.
   The newspaper Politika said some state hospitals may close down
if a newly adopted bankruptcy law is strictly enforced.
   The bankruptcy law, designed to revive the ailing economy,
forsees the closing down of all enterprises that lose money.
   Serbian and Slovenian doctors maintain that private medical
practice would create additional jobs for at least 4,000 doctors
currently registered as unemployed in Yugoslavia.
   They said it would also bring a return of several thousand
Yugoslav medical specialists who have been working in Western
countries and have accumulated large foreign currency savings.

<TEXT>
   Thirty-one years ago, Brigitte Bardot wrapped her
voluptuous body in a sheet, tantalizing moviegoers around the world
who flocked to see France's new ``sex kitten'' in the film made by
her director-husband, Roger Vadim.
   The film, ``And God Created Woman,'' became a movie classic,
launched BB's career and defined the tone and content for the
director's subsequent films.
   Vadim has gone back to the same title for his latest film, which
has little in common with the 1956 version except a continuing
fascination with freedom, sensuality and bourgeois morality.
   If this sounds a bit pedantic, remember that Vadim is the
filmmaker who gave the world the avant-garde sci-fi romp
``Barbarella'' starring his young, blond wife, Jane Fonda.
   His films are never short on beauty, especially the blond,
blue-eyed kind. Vadim has cast his 26 movies with women ranging
from elegant Catherine Deneuve, his third wife, to earthy Angie
Dickinson, and from intellectual Jeanne Moreau to sexpot Susan
Sarandon.
   For the new ``And God Created Woman,'' which opens this month in
the United States, Vadim chose blond Rebecca DeMornay, whose
previous credits include playing the saucy strumpet opposite Tom
Cruise in ``Risky Business'' and the angelic girl next door in
``The Trip to Bountiful.''
   ``People tell Rebecca that she has never looked more beautiful
than in this film,'' said Vadim, the Gallic Svengali, as he relaxed
in a borrowed Paris apartment after a morning of television
interviews. ``But it wasn't intentional. I make people look
beautiful, I can't help it.
   ``You wouldn't ask Rodin to make an ugly sculpture, or me to
make a film with an ugly woman. That's my style, that's my nature.''
   Bardot played a woman who marries a man in order to escape an
orphanage, only to fall for the man's younger brother, played by
Jean-Louis Trintignent. Although in the end she remains with her
older husband, the film is an exploration of sexual freedom.
   ``I wanted to show a normal young girl whose only difference was
that she behaved in the way a boy might, without any sense of guilt
on a moral or sexual level,'' Vadim said. ``There was really
nothing shocking in what Brigitte did, what was provocative was her
natural sensuality.''
   Vadim said sexual liberty is taken for granted now and women in
the 1980s are fighting for freedom of a different sort. He said he
didn't want to remake his earlier film but wanted to illuminate the
problems faced by a modern, young woman.
   ``Women now seek the freedom to be themselves, to be successful
in work without renouncing old-fashioned romanticism. Women want to
keep what they have gained without giving up those romantic ideas
which are very nice in life,'' said the 60-year-old Vadim, who
looks more like a French lawyer in his gray slacks and navy
pullover than an international film director.
   The film, shot in Santa Fe, N.M., tells the story of a young,
female prisoner who meets a carpenter working at the jail and
marries him as a way to show she is a stable candidate for parole.
   Her husband is nice, but chauvinistic, and the film follows
their relationship to an ``optimistic end, where they can stay
together without her giving up herself.''
   Vadim moved to Malibu, Calif., after his divorce from Fonda and
rented a house across from her so the two could share in the
raising of their daughter. He also has children by Deneuve and his
second wife, Annette Stroyberg.
   During the interview, he talked about the movie industry and
said his counterparts in French film lack the professionalism that
characterizes Hollywood. He pointed out that 1987 was one of the
worst years in a decade for box-office receipts in France, while
the opposite was true in the United States.
   ``French filmmakers are beginning to realize they have to try
harder, put more thought and effort into their films and make them
more international,'' he said.
   Vadim has been asked by several Paris producers to shoot his
next film in France and is considering making a science-fiction
film or suspense thriller here in English.
   ``But you know I've never had great luck in France. When `And
God Created Woman' was released the critics were horrible,
especially to Brigitte who they said couldn't act,'' he said. ``Of
course she couldn't, but she had another quality, she was and is
inimitable, unique.''
   After the film was an international success, the French critics
changed their minds, he said.
   ``I am sure that these same critics will aggress my new movie,
saying, `how can you touch such a classic, French masterpiece?'''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Administration's War on Drugs Brings Mixed
Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The good-news, bad-news assessment that Ronald
and Nancy Reagan gave of America's drug problem pretty much
describes the administration's record in fighting it.
   While President Reagan and his wife have alerted people to the
threat, the administration's war against drugs has produced only
mixed results, and consequently a lot of arguing and
finger-pointing.
   Nowhere was this more evident than at this week's White House
Conference on a Drug-Free America, where administration
drug-fighting strategy came in for a lot of second-guessing.
   Kicking off the conference Monday, Reagan claimed progress in
attacking ``the supply side of the crusade against drugs.'' Mrs.
Reagan gave a more pessimistic report on the demand side, saying
``we must face the fact that drugs are tearing our communities
apart.''
   Reagan said ``we've strengthened the laws'' and ``drug seizures
are at an all-time high.''
   Seizures of cocaine and the confiscation of drug-related assets
are at record levels, he said, and arrests are up by 66 percent.
   Yet, his drug-fighting performance came under attack because
horror stories about abuse still abound _ in cities and in the
suburbs. Many drug-producing countries remain ambivalent about
cooperative drug-fighting efforts, while traffickers skirt
interdiction efforts.
   The conference turned into a critique of the administration's
record. Several speakers, including a member of Reagan's Cabinet,
barked that not enough is being done.
   ``If we are winning the war on drugs, I wish the commanders
would go out and tell it to the troops in the field,'' said Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control.
   ``We need to get away from a policy of containment,'' said Rep.
Clay Shaw, R-Fla. ``We want you to come up with a plan for victory.
Let's fight it like we fought World War II, not like Vietnam. Let's
fight to win.''
   While an administration becomes accustomed to attacks from
Congress, sometimes from both the Democratic and Republican sides
of the aisle, Reagan's policy was also questioned by Secretary of
Education William Bennett.
   ``We are in real danger of losing the war against drugs,''
Bennett told the conference. He called for direct U.S. military
intervention in producing countries to destroy drug operations.
   Reagan has taken comfort in a Health and Human Services survey
showing that for the first time in 13 years, a declining proportion
of high school seniors admit having used cocaine.
   But a congressional report released Tuesday, while the
conference was in progress, seemed to cast some doubt on that. A
study by the General Accounting Office said some experts fear the
decline from 16.9 percent to 15.2 percent among the respondents
saying they used cocaine may not have taken into account the newly
popular ``crack'' form of cocaine which is smoked.
   The administration's war on drugs faces other problems. For
instance, Reagan's principal initiative aimed at attacking the
demand side of the problem _ a program of wide-scale voluntary
testing across America _ has never gotten off the ground because of
legal problems.
   The Supreme Court just last Monday agreed for the first time to
decide a case involving the constitutionally thorny issue of
mandatory work-place drug testing _ and its decision may not set
widespread precedent because it deals specifically with law
enforcement jobs rather than general employment.
   Congressional critics also say the administration has shown
little return on the more than $21.5 billion spent on combating
drugs over the last seven years, and state and local officials have
complained that Reagan budget cuts have adversely affected their
ability to deal with the problem.
   Bennett came closer than anyone in the administration to
admitting that the counter-attack wasn't working very well.
   ``We should consider broader use of military force against both
the production and shipment of drugs,'' he said.
   The issue did not elude the attention of presidential hopefuls,
either.
   Pat Robertson declared that ``if one of those drug planes is
flying without giving identification ... coming into this country,
I wouldn't hesitate to give orders to shoot him down.''
   But Jesse Jackson said tough talk isn't enough.
   ``It's a cop-out to just say to children, `Just say no to
drugs.' ... Children do not buy $150 billion worth of drugs. ...
Children do not grow the drugs, do not run the cartels,'' Jackson
said in a stump speech.
   ``We must stop the flow of drugs into our country. It's
corrupting our society. If elected, I will ... cut the supply of
drugs. But you the people must cut the demand for drugs.''

<HEAD>Meese Backs Bill To Ban Plastic Handguns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III says a
conservative Republican's bill to ban undetectable plastic handguns
would be effective against terrorists who might use such weapons.
   Meese's endorsement of legislation sponsored by Sen. James
McClure, R-Idaho, is the latest development in a growing dispute
over plastic guns.
   Supporters of rival legislation say that McClure's bill would
still permit guns to slip by metal detectors and X-ray machines at
their current settings.
   McClure on Wednesday released a letter by Meese, saying: ``Based
on our review, we believe that your bill ... is an excellent
legislative proposal to deal with the threat posed by criminals and
terrorists armed with such weapons.''
   The National Rifle Association also backs McClure's bill.
   The McClure proposal would make it illegal to manufacture or
import a plastic firearm unless one of these conditions exists:
   _The barrel is made in whole or in part of a metallic substance
that can be detected by a magnetometer.
   _The serial number required by law is engraved on a metallic
substance capable of detection.
   The measure also would require plastic portions of any such
firearm to be infused with substances that would register on a
X-ray machine.
   Handgun Control Inc. and a coalition of law enforcement groups
have joined to oppose McClure's bill and support legislation
sponsored by Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. Metzenbaum has
support from Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.
   Metzenbaum and his supporters say their legislation has the
ingredient that McClure's measure lacks: a requirement that the
guns have enough metal to be detected at currently used settings of
security machines.
   They contend that guns meeting the guidelines in McClure's
proposal would only set off alarms if detectors were operated at
settings so low they would stop everyone with a key chain.
   Plastic guns are not yet in production, but Handgun Control Inc.
said a Florida manufacturer will be ready to produce them in a year.

   ``Smoking-related deaths are costing the nation at least $65

the remaining two-thirds _ a whopping $43 billion _ is attributable

borne by the average citizen _ and nearly 75 percent of Americans
don't even smoke.
   ``It makes no sense that while the Surgeon General's office is
waging a campaign against smoking, the federal government is
involved in price supports for tobacco. And it's illogical for
politicians to bemoan the grave health consequences of tobacco
while, at the same time, supporting its production.
   ``I believe the federal government should get out of tobacco
production, and continue its campaign to ducate the public on the

tobacco. However, I do not oppose the tobacco industry's own effort
to provide economic assistance through the existing Commodity

   ``I support measures to ban smoking on commercial airlines on
short flights and to restrict smoking to certain areas on longer

   ``I believe the government should do everything in its power to
educate the public about the hazards associated with smoking. I
have been a strong supporter of stronger warning labels on

   Campaign aide Jay Angoff said Hart does not support price

   On anti-smoking efforts, Angoff said Hart ``certainly wouldn't

   ``As long as there is a demand for tobacco and people who make
their livelihood from meeting that demand, the federal government
should offer its assistance.
   ``But we have to recognize that 350,000 deaths per year are
related to smoking. The government must beef-up educational efforts
to inform the public of this hazard. Just as importantly, we must

<HEAD>She Recalls a Doctor Saying, ``I'll Give Him Four Months''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan says doctors should be more
circumspect about commenting in public on the health problems of
presidents and their families.
   In a television interview to be broadcast Friday night, Mrs.
Reagan recalled an instance when she and President Reagan were
watching television while he was in the hospital recovering from an
operation ``and some doctor came on and said, `Well, I'll give him
about four or five months.'''
   ``I thought to myself: Doesn't it ever occur to these people
that we might be sitting watching?' What a terrible, terrible
statement to make!''
   She said Reagan did not react adversely to the doctor's comment
but she said he reasonably could have wondered at that moment
whether information about his health was being withheld from him.
   ``It would be a normal reaction,'' she said.
   Mrs. Reagan made her comments in an interview with Barbara
Walters for a segment of the ABC-TV News ``20-20'' program. By
coincidence, the program is being shown on the Reagans' 36th
wedding anniversary.
   Mrs. Reagan did not say in the interview what the president was
recovering from at the time the gloomy prognosis was broadcast. Nor
did she provide any further details. Reagan has undergone several
operations during the seven years of his presidency.
   Recalling her bout with breast cancer, the first lady also said
she did not understand the criticism directed at her when she chose
to have her breast removed rather than to undergo chemotherapy or
radiation treatment.
   ``I really don't understand the people who criticize,'' she
said. ``It was my choice to make. So don't criticize me for making
what I thought was the right choice for me.
   ``You know the whole point about feminism is that you have a
choice, that women have a choice. ...
   ``And I think having doctors who know nothing about the case,
who know nothing about you, and know nothing about the case at all
coming on giving their opinion, I don't think that's right.''

<HEAD>Legal Adviser Says Keep Star Wars Issue Out Of INF Pact</HEAD>

   The Senate should not revise the pending arms
pact with the Soviet Union to bind future administrations to the
current understanding of its intent, says the State Department
legal adviser.
   ``I don't think it is necessary or desirable to do that kind of
thing,'' legal adviser Abraham D. Sofaer said in an interview.
   The heart of the issue is not so much a treaty signed last
December banning medium-range nuclear missiles from superpower
arsenals as a treaty signed in 1972 which limits testing of
President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative missile defense
system, known as Star Wars.
   Democratic Whip Alan Cranston of California has been holding
discussions with senators from both parties, and an aide said he
expects ``there to be language in the ratification resolution
addressing the treaty interpretation issues.''
   Cranston has predicted that the treaty will win the necessary 67
votes in the 100-member body to be ratified.
   Few senators have expressed disagreement over the meaning of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact signed at the Washington
summit last December calling on the superpowers to destroy their
nuclear missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles.
   The central controversy is an interpretation of the ABM pact
written by Sofaer in 1985 which would allow wider testing of Star
Wars components.
   Cranston's legislative aide, Gerry Warburg, said the language
expected in the INF resolution ``would contain a more broad
statement concerning the interpretation of treaties generally,''
including the ABM pact.
   Cranston, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., of the Foreign
Relations Committee, all oppose Sofaer's ``broad interpretation''
of the ABM pact. Warburg said they had been discussing the INF
resolution with Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   The senators contend that allowing the broad interpretation
amounts to changing the rules in the middle of the game and would
set a dangerous precedent in which any administration could duck
treaty requirements simply by reinterpreting them.
   Sofaer said inclusion of restrictive language in a resolution
ratifying the INF treaty would not be binding on the Soviet Union,
and could complicate rather than resolve interpretation of the ABM
pact.
   ``I know that they are not going to get a settlement of the ABM
dispute this way,'' said Sofaer. ``It is a potential problem for
INF ratification and I think overwhelmingly people support INF
ratification.''
   Sofaer noted that Shultz had sent the Senate the 31-volume
negotiating record of the INF pact and had also agreed that any
testimony by administration officials would be ``authoritative''
and reflect the president's understanding of the treaty.
   ``Those practical things have been achieved,'' said Sofaer,
objecting to including in the ratification resolution any language
that would commit future administrations to the current
understanding of the treaty.
   ``If you want to go further, you might end up confusing or even
harming international legal practice relating to treaty
ratification,'' he said.
   While the Senate can bind the administration to a particular
interpretation of either the INF or the ABM treaties, he said, it
cannot bind the Soviet Union, unless the treaties are renegotiated.
   ``The treaty reflects two relationships,'' he said. ``It
reflects a relationship between two sovereign nations, and then it
also reflects the relations between the United States executive
branch and the Senate.
   ``When you talk about the meaning of a treaty, you are talking
about the international relationship. You are talking about what
binds the two nations.''

<DATELINE>KFAR NAAMI, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinian flags flutter
from the power lines in this West Bank community. PLO grafitti
adorns the walls. People here call Kfar Naami a ``liberated
village.''
   Eight miles over the mountains, residents of Bir Zeit have
blocked the roads with stones. They, too, claim their village is
``liberated.''
   Throughout the West Bank, a few communities in the past few
weeks have defied the Israeli army and declared independence from
the Israeli occupation administration.
   These little pieces of ``Palestine'' are the source of much
pride among the Arabs. But the reality is that the Israelis do not
want to take the trouble to ``unliberate'' many of the rebellious
communities.
   ``This is a liberated village here,'' said Aziz Attaya of Kfar
Naami, wearing a thick beard and a traditional Arab headdress
around his neck. ``We will all die for the creation of a
Palestinian state under the leadership of the PLO.''
   But, countered Munir Naser, a professor of biochemistry at Bir
Zeit University, ``The occupation is everywhere. Perhaps only our
homes are liberated, and in reality, it's not true even there.''
   Hamad, another Bir Zeit resident who did not give his last name,
admitted, ``We're not liberated in the true sense of lberation.
There is a feeling of not being under the control of the Israeli
occupation. At the same time, we know that they are still here and
still control the area.''
   In most liberated villages, people have run up the Palestinian
flag, organized demonstrations, blocked roads, and in some cases,
challenged the army to come and get them.
   The soldiers sometimes oblige. Sometimes they do not.
   These rebellions are irritating, even embarrassing for Israeli
authorities, but they don't have any real practical effect beyond
boosting the morale of local residents.
   The Israeli authorities believe they should be put down but note
that the priority is on keeping major roads open.
   ``The army is not everywhere, but deployed according to suitable
priorities,'' Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the West Bank's military
commander, told Israel's army radio.
   ``They are on the main roads and secondary roads that must be
guarded. They guard the movement of Israeli residents, be it school
buses or other traffic.''
   But a high-ranking police officer sounded tougher during a
crackdown on the imminently unliberated Silwan, a village
incorporated into Jerusalem after being captured from Jordan in
1967.
   ``The people in Silwan for the last two months thought they
belonged to Palestine,'' said the officer. ``We are now teaching
them they live in Israel, and they will never forget it.''
   In Kfar Naami, a village of 2,000, one Palestinian died in a
clash with soldiers, but the army hasn't been back. The road
through Kfar Naami simply isn't important enough to be worth the
trouble of reclaiming.
   Bir Zeit has a population of 2,000. The university, closed
because Israeli officials say they want to prevent disturbances,
normally has about 2,800 students.
   There is a demonstration every Friday and Sunday in Bir Zeit.
Teachers believe the government stays away because it fears the
university will become a breeding ground for increased dissent and
organization.
   Naser says another reason the Israelis leave Bir Zeit alone is
because it has a more sophisticated population. Many of the
teaching staff studied abroad, are articulate and can use their
voices and outside contacts to tell the world what is going on.
   Some villagers are itching for a fight.
   ``The army doesn't come into the village because there are no
settlers who pass through here,'' said a teen-ager named Ahmed.
   ``I'd like to see the army come here,'' he said. ``Not coming is
not good for the town because people elsewhere, like in Gaza, think
we are not doing anything here. I hope they come. I would like to
fight them. I'd be happy to sacrifice my life.''

<HEAD>New President Says UPI Needs $1 Million in Immediate Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International's new managers need
about $1 million in loans immediately to pay overdue bills for
items such as health care, rents and telephones, according to a
memo from the company's new president.
   ``At the end of our first week, our preliminary analysis shows
that the financial condition of the company has been deteriorating
steadily, and that monumental efforts are needed to save it from
liquidation,'' Paul Steinle wrote in a letter to employees dated
March 1.
   UPI needs ``short-term financing to bridge its cash flow
requirements until additional investors can be approached,''
Steinle said.
   Steinle works for WNW Group Inc., a media investment group that
assumed control of the financially ailing wire service on Feb. 19.
   WNW bought control of the company's stock from Mexican publisher
Mario Vazquez Rana for an undisclosed sum. UPI emerged from Chapter
11 proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court with Vazquez Rana's
purchase of the company in June 1986.
   In his three-page letter, Steinle said the Wire Service Guild,
the union representing company employees, has been offered ``the
opportunity to participate'' in ``short-term loan financing.''
   Steinle's memo to employees included portions of a letter sent
to the guild over the weekend. Dan Carmichael, a union spokesman,
said he had no comment on the letter, which the guild received
Tuesday.
   But he said he was curious to find out what the company meant by
a ``loan opportunity.''
   In the letter to the union, UPI management said the company is
``facing an immediate and critical situation in the form of the
funding of its ongoing operations.''
   It said WNW Group ``must immediately obtain approximately one
million dollars in loans to enable UPI to begin paying past due
bills for critical items such as health care, rents, telephones,
etc.''
   In the long run, UPI's financial situation will require ``an
infusion of capital, which can only be provided by a sale of stock
or securities,'' the letter said.
   Steinle said the company wants the guild to move quickly _ by
March 14 _ to adopt an employee stock option plan. Under conditions
set by the bankruptcy court, UPI's employees have the right of
first refusal to buy the company if it is put on the block.
   Announcing the change of management last week, Steinle and Dr.
Earl W. Brian, WNW's chairman, said they hoped to have a business
plan for UPI's future within four to six weeks.
   Steinle's letter said the company intended to raise money
through the sale of stock as soon as the business plan is complete.
   The managers said that during Vazquez Rana's tenure, the company
was losing about a $1 million a month.
   Brian, 48, is also the chairman of Infotechnology Inc., an
electronics communications company based in New York. Among its
subsidiaries are Financial News Network, a 24-hour cable television
company. Infotech, as the company is known, is a minority
shareholder of WNW Group.

<HEAD>Traficant Appeals Adverse Tax Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. James Traficant, a declared candidate for
president, has appealed a U.S. Tax Court decision saying he owes
back taxes and penalties for failing to report bribes of $108,000
from reputed organized-crime figures in 1980.
   Traficant, D-Ohio, filed a notice of appeal with the tax court
Wednesday, throwing the case into the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Cincinnati.
   Traficant has described himself as a regional candidate for
president and so far has not appeared on a primary election ballot.
Spokesmen have said he will focus mainly on Ohio and neighboring
states.
   In an opinion issued last September, Judge John Williams said
Traficant's actions when he was campaigning for Mahoning County
sheriff in 1980 reflected an intent to evade taxes and the Internal
Revenue Service had convincingly established that the underpayment
was due to fraud.
   ``They're intimidating,'' Traficant said of the federal
government. ``They beat you down, they wear you out, and they're
working on me.''
   The IRS has calculated that Traficant owes nearly $90,000 in
back taxes and penalties.
   The civil tax case is based on testimony and evidence from
Traficant's 1983 criminal trial in which he was charged with
bribery and income tax evasion. In that case, Traficant defended
himself and was acquitted.
   The charges alleged that Traficant accepted money in exchange
for his promise to ignore the illegal activities of reputed
mobsters in Youngstown, Ohio.
   The case was based on tape recordings allegedly between
Traficant and the mobsters and a written statement to the FBI the
government contended Traficant had signed saying he took the money
in exchange for a promise of cooperation.
   Traficant argued that the money was not income because he
returned most of it and used legitimate contributions in his
campaign for sheriff.

   A senator says the CIA is conducting an
inquiry into whether the agency provided personal and political
information on U.S. senators to Panamanian military ruler Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Wednesday two officials
identifying themselves as being with the CIA's office of the
inspector general interviewed Jose I. Blandon, a former top
Panamanian intelligence official, last week.
   Blandon alleged at a Senate hearing last month that the agency
had provided information on senators to Noriega, who in turn passed
it on to him. The CIA is prohibited by law from domestic spying on
U.S. citizens.
   D'Amato said Blandon told him the CIA investigators were
interested primarily in his charges that Noriega had received
information about both the political beliefs and the personal lives
of several senators and staff members.
   He said Blandon had gone into the lengthy interview under the
impression he would be talking to investigators from the Justice
Department. ``He was surprised that it turned out to be
intelligence people,'' D'Amato said.
   ``He didn't take it as any kind of harassment. He indicated to
the agency that he could help them if they were interested.''
   D'Amato and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., called the hearings last
month at which Blandon and other witnesses publicly wove
complicated tales about how Noriega sold out his country to drug
traffickers.
   A CIA official, speaking on condition of anonymity, would not
confirm the internal inquiry, but said ``it would make sense'' for
the agency's investigators to want to speak directly to someone who
had made such charges. The CIA has categorically denied providing
any such information to the Panamanian government.
   D'Amato said Blandon related to the CIA investigators the same
story he gave to the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on
terrorism, narcotics and international operations Feb. 9-10.
   Blandon, who was fired in January as Panama's consul general in
New York, told investigators then that Noriega received and passed
to him materials on senators and their staff members, typed in
English on plain white paper.
   In the lower right-hand corner was the signature of a Panamanian
intelligence official who forwarded the material, along with an
indication of the original source of the information _ usually the
CIA or the National Security Council, said officials familiar with
the classified portion of Blandon's testimony. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``These were not benign official biographies,'' one official
said. ``They were very pointed descriptions, directed at the local
market'' and apparently designed to curry favor with Noriega.
   Blandon said intelligence services of other countries in the
region received similar materials regularly, the officials said.
   Blandon also has made the allegations in conversations with Sen.
David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, and members of his staff. Boren has said he has ``no
reason to believe'' the allegations, but is looking into them.
   Others involved in intelligence have sought to cast doubts on
Blandon's credibility and his motives for turning against Noriega,
whom he served as a longtime top adviser. But D'Amato reiterated
his belief that Blandon is telling the truth.
   D'Amato raised the possibility that the information about
senators and staff members could have been compiled by either a
low-level ``functionary'' at the CIA or by an outside
``contractor'' working for the agency.

   In his final appearance on the NATO
stage, President Reagan got virtually everything he wanted,
including a bouquet for his peacemaking efforts with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and a mandate to demand more from the Soviet leader this
spring.
   Reagan leaves Brussels today with a strong reaffirmation of
alliance solidarity, criticism of the Soviet record on human
rights, and NATO demands for sweeping cutbacks in Warsaw Pact
tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear forces.
   In the spirit of harmony, major differences were muted or
ignored as NATO leaders celebrated the signing of a U.S.-Soviet
treaty to eliminate a whole class of nuclear missiles in Europe and
Asia.
   As the leader of the Western alliance, Reagan can take
satisfaction that NATO weathered the disarmament storm of 1982 and
deployed intermediate-range nuclear missiles, a step that brought
the Soviets back to the negotiating table and produced the INF
treaty.
   Now, with just 10 months remaining in office, he has a vote of
confidence for negotiations with the Kremlin toward a 50 percent
cut in strategic nuclear arms, as well as a strategy for East-West
talks in which NATO will insist on lower levels of Warsaw Pact
tanks, artillery, planes and ground forces.
   Gorbachev has scored points in Europe with his talk of peace and
disarmament, and now Reagan has been put in the same spotlight with
new attention focused on the INF treaty.
   ``Over the last several months, a number of people have said the
INF agreement has caused fissures within the alliance; the alliance
is troubled; Europe is adrift; they're not sure of the United
States' commitment,'' said Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, the president's
national security adviser.
   ``Well, the president reaffirmed our commitment to Europe. He
did it clearly, and that reaffirmation was welcomed by the other
members of the alliance,'' Powell added. ``So I think it's been a
most useful meeting, one that was necessary, one that was
important.''
   The summit was a bright spot in what is likely to be a difficult
year at home for Reagan.
   As a lame-duck president with a Democratic-controlled Congress
hoping to keep Republicans out of the White House, Reagan will have
little chance to advance his legislative agenda.
   Traditionally, then, foreign policy becomes the focus of
outgoing presidents, and Reagan is no exception.
   The NATO summit with the leaders of 15 other countries was
another in a series of farewell sessions, though he will see five
of the officials in Toronto at the annual economic summit in June.
   Before the economic summit, however, comes the trip to Moscow,
his fourth meeting with Gorbachev. It is expected sometime in late
May or early June.
   Both sides seem eager for Reagan's visit, even though it appears
unlikely the leaders will be able to sign another major arms pact.
Reagan said in a recent interview it appeared unlikely there would
be enough time to wrap up a strategic arms treaty before the Moscow
summit, but he said he thought it could be completed before he
leaves office.
   Regardless, a Reagan trip to Moscow, to the heart of what he
once called the Evil Empire, would dominate world attention and
give both the president and the Soviet leader another forum to seek
a legacy as peacemaker.

   Measuring the difference in NATO and Warsaw
Pact conventional forces is more than just a numbers game. It is a
complicated and tricky task that goes beyond simply counting tanks
and soldiers.
   Western leaders meeting in Brussels on Wednesday issued a
special statement demanding huge cutbacks in Soviet bloc
conventional forces, highlighting an issue that has divided
negotiators for years.
   Since 1973, negotiators for the alliances have been trying to
agree on how many troops the blocs could throw into a fight in
Europe. Western analysts say it would be more than 2 million on a
side.
   Now, as Europe heads for elimination of medium-range nuclear
missiles under a treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, new attention has been focused on
conventional forces.
   The Pentagon says the Soviet bloc has a substantial edge over
NATO in five major ground force categories.
   According to the Pentagon's 1987 report ``Soviet Military
Power,'' Moscow and its European allies have 230 divisions compared
with NATO's 121. The Soviet edge in main battle tanks is 52,000 to
24,250. They lead in antitank guided weapons launchers 28,000 to
22,580.
   The report says the East bloc has 42,000 artillery and mortar
launchers compared with the West's 18,350 and has 54,000 armored
personnel carriers, while NATO has 41,500.
   Of the direct comparisons, NATO leads only in attack
helicopters, 1,250 to 970.
   The numbers include forces deployed in Europe and those that can
be rapidly deployed from the United States.
   When he was supreme allied commander in Europe from 1979 to
1987, Gen. Bernard W. Rogers used such figures in a set speech on
the subject. He would say, in effect: ``We'd give them a good fight
if deterrence failed and a war broke out, but it wouldn't be long
before I'd have to pick up the phone and ask the NATO politicians
to let me use nuclear weapons.''
   Even Rogers warned, however, against what has become known as
``bean counting'' _ judging strength by mere numbers.
   Joshua Epstein, a Brookings Institution scholar, for example,
has said ``neither the Pentagon nor the Congress actually behave as
though numerical equality mattered. If either did, it would be
frantically shoveling money out of aircraft carriers, where we lead
14:1 _ and into tanks ...''
   There are many variables that have to be weighed. They include:
   _ The difference in requirements of defensive and offensive
forces. Military history has shown that offensive forces need
massive superiority at any given point of an attack against
well-fortified positions.
   Since NATO is a defensive alliance, it presumably does not need
more or even equal numbers of troops to stop an attack, according
to NATO doctrine.
   _ The quality of weaponry. NATO considers its forces have better
and more modern equipment than the Soviets have.
   _ Troop reliability. Would Soviet allies fight as fiercely in an
invasion of West Europe as U.S. allies defending their homelands?
Many analysts doubt they would, and the authors of ``Soviet
Military Power'' concede it ``is not a certainty.''
   _ Terrain. The potential battlegrounds of NATO's central front _
West Germany in particular _ are full of streams, forests, bogs,
cities and other choke points that could lower the effectiveness of
tanks. ``Wars are not fought on paper,'' wrote George Perkovich, a
World Policy Institute fellow who recently studied the conventional
balance.
   _ Asymmetries. Even with the Soviet edge in ground forces, the
West has an advantage of 3,450 to 2,800 in fighter-bombers for
ground attack, which would be used to hit forces massed for
offensives.
   The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies _
whose annual report ``The Military Balance'' is the quintessence of
bean counting _ says the ``conventional balance is still such as to
make general military aggression a highly risky undertaking for
either side.''
   ``There would still appear to be insufficient overall strength
on either side to guarantee a victory,'' the IISS said.

   Here are excerpts of the NATO
statement, ``Conventional Arms Control: The Way Ahead,'' issued
Wednesday at a summit meeting of the Western alliance.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's military presence in Europe, at a level far
in excess of its needs for self defense, directly challenges our
security as well as our hopes for change in the political situation
in Europe. Thus the conventional imbalance in Europe remains at the
core of Europe's security concerns. The problem is to a large
extent a function of the Warsaw Pact's superiority in key
conventional weapon systems. But it is not only a matter of
numerical imblances. Other asymmetries are also important, for
example:
   _ the Warsaw Pact, based on the Soviet Union's forward-deployed
forces, has a capability for surprise attack and large-scale
offensive action; the allies neither have, not aspire to, such a
capability;
   _ the countries of the Warsaw Pact form a contiguous land mass;
those of the alliance are geographically disconnected;
   _ the Warsaw Pact can generate a massive reinforcement potential
from distances of only a few hundred kilometers; many allied
reinforcements need to cross the Atlantic;
   _ the Warsaw Pact's military posture and activities are still
shrouded in secrecy, whereas those of allied countries are
transparent and under permanent public scrutiny.
   These asymmetries are compounded by the dominant presence in
Europe of the conventional armed forces of the Soviet Union. The
represent 50 percent of all the active divisions in Europe between
the Atlantic and the Urals. This Soviet conventional superiority
and its miltiary presence in other Eastern European countries serve
a political as well as a miltitary function. They cast a shadow
over the whole of Europe.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   We reiterate our conviction that military forces should only
exist to prevent war and to ensure self defense, not for the
purpose of initiating aggression and not for the purpose of
political or military intimidation. Our ability to prevent every
kind of war, nuclear or conventional, rests on our capacity and
determination to deter any form of aggression. All the allies'
military resources are designed to contribute to that objective.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The existence of a conventional imbalance in favor of the Warsaw
Pact is not the only reason for the presence of nuclear weapons in
Europe. The countries of the alliance are, and will remain, under
the threat of Soviet nuclear forcs of varying ranges. Although
conventional parity would bring important benefits for stability,
only the nuclear element can confront a potential aggressor with an
unacceptable risk; therefore, for the foreseeable future deterrence
will continue to require an adequate mix of nuclear as well as
conventional forces.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   We will continue to ensure that our military forces are
effective and up-to-date, in particular by: continued compliance
with the principle of shared risks and responsiblities and
acceptance of the priorities essential to the strengthening of our
defense capabilities; provision of adequate defense expenditure,
together with efforts to obtain the greatest return on our defense
investment; closer cooperation designed to remedy key deficiencies
and, in this context, support for recent legislative and other
initiatives designed to foster cooperation in the area of
conventional armaments, especially research, development,
production and procurement; helping to meet the needs of the less
advantaged allies in strengthening their conventionl defenses, thus
redressing important existing deficiences.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Security in Europe involves not just military, but also
political, economic and, above all, humanitarian factors. We look
forward to a Europe undivided, in which people of all states can
freely receive ideas and information; enjoy their fundamental human
rights; and determine their own future. Allied forces are stationed
outside their national territory to protect these values and to
uphold the solidarity of our free alliance. They cannot therefore
be equated with Soviet forces stationed in Eastern Europe. A just
and lasting peaceful order in Europe requires that all states enjoy
relations of confidence with their own citizens; trust them to make
political or economic choices of their own; and allow them to
receive information from and exchange ideas with citizens of other

   In accordance with the principles of our approach to
conventional arms control ... our objectives in the forthcoming
conventional stability negotiations will be: the establishment of a
secure and stable balance of conventional forces at lower levels;
the elimination of disparities prejudicial to stability and
security; and, as a matter of high priority, the elimination of the
capability for launching surprise attack and for initiating
large-scale offensive action.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Our aim will be to establish a situation in Europe in which
force postures as well as the numbers and deployments of weapon
systems no longer make surprise attack and large-scale offensive
action a feasible option. ... we need to enhance stability in the
whole of Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals; and to do so in a
way which, while safeguarding the security of all Allies, takes
account of the concentrations of Warsaw Pact forces and the
particular problems affecting the Central, Southern and Northern
regions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Equal number or percentage reductions by both sides would not
eliminate the disparities which threaten stability in Europe. ...
Our goal is to redress the conventional imbalance. This can be
achieved through a set of measures including ... limitations,
redeployment provisions and related measures as well as the
establishment of equal ceilings.
   This outcome will require highly assymmetrical reductions by the
East and will entail, for example, the elimination from Europe of
tens of thousands of Warsaw Pact weapons relevant to surprise
attack, among them tanks and artillery pieces ... we shall also
propose measures to produce greater openness of military activities
throughout Europe, safeguard the maintenance of lower force levels,
and support a rigorous, effective and reliable monitoring and
verification regime.
   This monitoring and verification regime will need to include the
exchange of detailed data about forces and deployments; and the
right to conduct sufficient on-site inspections to provide
confidence that agreed provisions are being complied with.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Early agreement on a conventional stability mandate ... would be
an important step forward. We seek the elimination of the
conventional imbalances which so threaten stability and security in
Europe. We also seek enhanced respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms on which lasting security and stability
ultimately depend.

<HEAD>IRS Says Employers Haven't Paid Billions Taken from Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is looking for
ways to make 338,000 employers hand over $3.73 billion in
delinquent employment taxes, most of which was withheld from
workers' paychecks.
   Because employment taxes account for 69 percent of all federal
revenues, says William Wauben, IRS assistant commissioner for
collections, ``even a slight decline ... can have a devastating
impact'' on government operations.
   The size of these delinquent taxes has grown 49 percent from
$2.5 billion in 1982, Wauben said at a news conference Wednesday.
This rise, which coincided with a steady growth in the value of
business payrolls and increases in Social Security taxes on workers
and their employers, is especially notable in the Southwest, where
the economy has suffered from declining oil prices.
   Even if an employer fails to forward withheld taxes, employees'
tax accounts and Social Security benefits will not be jeopardized
so long as they file an individual tax return, Wauben said.
   Meanwhile, the IRS reported that individual taxpayers are still
slow to file this year's tax returns. Through last week, the agency
said:
   _30.2 million returns had been received, down 4.9 percent from
the same period last year. But the gap is closing; last week, 6.7
million returns were received, up 3 percent from last year. The IRS
attributes this year's slowness to all the 1986 tax changes that
are affecting returns for the first time.
   _The IRS is processing returns at a faster rate. The inventory
of filed but unprocessed returns totaled 14.9 million last week,
down from 16.5 million a year earlier.
   _More than 7.55 million of the processed returns had been
certified for refunds, down 4.5 percent from a year ago. The
average refund is up 7.9 percent, to $793.
   Wauben said employers' failure to forward taxes withheld from
workers' checks often is caused by ignorance of the law or greed.
Often as not, Wauben said, the problem is traced to a failing
company's efforts to stay afloat.
   ``When employers find they are no longer able to keep their
business operating on the cash available and they ... are unable to
borrow from a bank or other lending institution, some begin using
the funds withheld from their employees' wages as their own,'' he
said.
   Employers are required to withhold Social Security and income
taxes from workers' wages, to contribute matching amounts for
Social Security and to pay unemployment taxes on their employees.
Businesses must forward these employment taxes to the IRS at least
once a quarter, although most employers pay once every week or two.
   To reduce delinquency, the IRS is stepping up efforts to educate
employers about their responsibilities and changing procedures to
put collections officers in touch with businesses more quickly. The
agency also is expanding a program designed to catch employers who
unlawfully classify some workers as independent contractors, rather
than employees, to avoid taxes.
   Employers do not withhold taxes from independent contractors,
who are required to make quarterly payments on their taxes. In many
cases, the IRS says, those workers understate earnings and some
don't even file tax returns.
   During a two-year study in 26 areas of the nation, IRS
collections officers audited 1,196 employers suspected of
misclassifying workers as independent contractors. As a result of
the study, 9,004 delinquent employment-tax returns were filed (a
return covers only one quarter) and the IRS hit 92 percent of the
audited employers with tax bills averaging $3,000.
   Because of those findings, the IRS has assigned nearly 400
collections officers to concentrate on investigating similar cases
and hopes to add another 350 next year.

<HEAD>LaRouche Buys TV Time To Detail Mars-Colonization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political extremist Lyndon LaRouche says he
will solve the nation's economic problems by establishing a
permanent U.S. colony on the planet Mars, a plan detailed in a
half-hour program to be shown on ABC-TV tonight.
   In the program, ``The Woman on Mars,'' the Democratic
presidential candidate proposes reviving the Apollo moon program
and using the existing shuttle system to colonize Mars. The
technology associated with the colony would spur the economy, he
says.
   ``The old aerospace program paid us back 10 cents for every
penny invested,'' LaRouche says in the program, which was previewed
for reporters Wednesday. ``The Mars program would pay us more.''
   LaRouche, a frequent fringe candidate for the presidency, paid
about $180,000 to air the 30-minute program at 8 p.m., said Dana
Scanlon, a spokeswoman for LaRouche. The show will pre-empt ``The
Charmings,'' which ABC planned to replace this month with ``Probe.''
   The program marks the second time LaRouche purchased prime
network time to promote his views. In a half-hour program on CBS-TV
on Feb. 4, LaRouche said the government was lying about the deadly
AIDS virus to avoid massive spending to control the disease.
LaRouche paid $250,000 for the air time.
   He said the virus is transmitted much like any other virus and
that most medical warnings about how it is spread are ``an outright
lie.''
   LaRouche defies traditional political labels and espouses views
of global conspiracies. Among them, he contends that the Queen of
England and the royal family are involved in drug trafficking.
   He is currently on trial in Boston on charges of conspiring to
obstruct a Justice Department investigation of alleged fund-raising
fraud by his 1984 presidential campaign.

<HEAD>Climber Lands Trespass Charge After Rappelling Off Bridge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rock climber hoping to land in the
Blackwater Creek ravine after rappelling off a bridge instead
landed in police custody.
   David Gloudemans, 24, of Lynchburg, said he was looking for a
new challenge and a shortcut when he tried to propel himself 150
feet off the Rivermont Bridge on Wednesday.
   ``Normally I do this on rocks, but it's hard to find good
climbing places close to home,'' he said, ``and I was a little
short on gas money today. I figured I'd just tie up, slip on down
and no one would know the difference.''
   His stunt didn't go unnoticed.
   Police officer M.L. Coleman was driving across the bridge and
saw Gloudemans vanish over the railing.
   ``I didn't know what to think,'' said Coleman, who has gone to
the bridge several times on suicide reports and accidental falls.
``I looked down over the side, and there he was. He was going to
tie on his rope and go on down. I said, `Let's talk about this.'''
   When rescuers from the Lynchburg Fire Department arrived, the
unruffled Gloudemans was sitting cross-legged on a concrete
abutment 20 feet below the bridge, dressed in jeans, a blue denim
jacket and a bandana. Far below him, a cluster of police officers
stood looking at the other end of his blue and orange ropes, which
were trailing across the ground. Above him on the bridge, an
impromptu command post discussed ways of bringing him back.
   Emergency medical technician Linda Eagle, a recent graduate of a
``rope course,'' was lowered over the bridge to bring him back. She
attached a harness to Gloudemans while eight police officers and
firefighters fed line down from a fire truck.
   ``The height didn't bother me,'' Eagle said, ``but I was a
little worried that he (Gloudemans) might not cooperate. The first
thing he said was `Why can't I go the rest of the way?'''
   Gloudemans eventually was retrieved, but not until after traffic
on the bridge's eastbound lane had been halted nearly 45 minutes.
He was arrested and charged with common law trespassing, and was
released on his own recognizance, Coleman said.
   ``Maybe I should have just gone ahead and jumped off,''
Gloudemans said, ``but I thought that would make it worse.''

   NATO is sounding a louder alarm about
the threat posed by bigger East bloc armies in Europe in hopes of
turning public attention away from Moscow's drive to free the
region of nuclear weapons.
   The shift in tactics also is designed to sidestep a split within
the Western alliance over how to approach future negotiations on
nuclear arms.
   President Reagan and leaders of the 15 other North Atlantic
Treaty Organization members highlighted the new Western emphasis on
non-nuclear arms by declaring Wednesday their eagerness to open new
negotiations.
   ``The conventional imbalance in Europe remains at the core of
Europe's security concerns,'' the NATO leaders said in a joint
statement.
   Their aim is to portray the Western alliance as united on an
important aspect of East-West arms control at a time when Moscow is
seeking to exploit a split among the U.S. allies on nuclear arms
strategy.
   A central message emerging from the NATO summit, which ends
Thursday, is that the East bloc's numerical superiority in many key
categories of conventional arms _ not the presence of nuclear
weapons in Europe _ is the greatest danger to Western security.
   ``The most direct threat to our security and to stability in
Europe lies in the Soviet Union's massive military presence at a
level exceeding its defense needs,'' Reagan said after Wednesday's
meetings.
   The NATO statement said the large Soviet armies ``cast a shadow
over the whole of Europe.''
   Washington hopes NATO can begin a new set of conventional arms
negotiations with the Soviet Union and its six Warsaw Pact allies
this fall.
   The NATO initiative also shifts the public spotlight away from
West Germany's dispute with its allies over whether and when to
replace very short-range nuclear weapons with new, more effective
ones. Most of these weapons, if fired, would strike German soil,
East or West.
   The Brussels summit was aiming to gloss over the German problem
by saying in a broader declaration Thursday that talks on
short-range nuclear missiles could be undertaken in conjunction
with _ but not necessarily at the same time as _ other arms
negotiations.
   That leaves open the question of whether NATO should insist that
the Soviets reduce their conventional forces before the two blocs
engage in negotiations to further reduce their nuclear arsenals in
Europe.
   According to Western estimates, the Warsaw Pact holds about a
3-to-1 advantage in numbers of tanks and artillery, although NATO
enjoys an edge in some crucial naval forces and in fighter aircraft
in Europe.
   The new stress on conventional arms, NATO hopes, will steal some
of the thunder from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign
to woo the West European public with calls for freeing the
continent of nuclear arms.
   All NATO members agree they must keep some nuclear weapons in
Europe to deter a Soviet attack, although they also have fully
endorsed the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate all intermediate-range
nuclear missiles. The more than 400 U.S. INF missiles are based in
Western Europe.
   Gorbachev has significantly improved his public image in Western
Europe by agreeing to the INF deal, first proposed by Reagan in
1981. It cast him as a dramatically different, more peaceful
Kremlin leader.
   Now NATO wants to test Gorbachev's intentions further by
proposing that he eliminate the Warsaw Pact's capability to launch
a surprise attack by conventional forces.
   The two military blocs have been working for one year to agree
on a framework for a new set of negotiations to establish a more
stable balance of non-nuclear forces in Europe. The talks may begin
this fall.
   These talks would replace a narrower set of East-West
negotiations on cutting troop levels, which have gone nowhere in 15
years.
   The new negotiations would be even more complicated,
encompassing a wider geographic area, involving more nations and
including not only troops but also a wide range of weapons and
equipment.

   Judith Sherman and William Foley have
changed their wedding plans from small to mall.
   The couple had planned a ceremony attended just by relatives and
close friends, followed by a modest reception at a restaurant.
Instead, they will exchange vows Saturday in the middle of Hanover
Mall, surrounded by family, friends and up to 5,000 shoppers.
   ``This is probably the most public wedding anyone has ever
had,'' said Miss Sherman, 21, of Halifax. ``We always like
everything to be different and this is about as different as it
gets.''
   Miss Sherman and Foley had planned a small ceremony because they
could not afford a big wedding. But their mall nuptial won't cost
them a penny, because they won a drawing to promote a bridal fair
there.
   Merchants are donating an estimated $15,000 worth of goods and
services, including the bride's gown, tuxedos, invitations, wedding
rings, flowers, music, and a honeymoon in Florida.
   ``We really wanted a big wedding, but we didn't have the money
so we didn't even bother to discuss it,'' Miss Sherman said. ``And
then all this happened. All we have to do is sit back and enjoy
ourselves.''

   Some residents of this New York
City suburb want to bring the legend of Sleepy Hollow home.
   Residents will vote March 15 on whether to rename the town for
the famous Washington Irving story about the Headless Horseman.
Irving lived near here and modeled his fictional Sleepy Hollow
after the picturesque Hudson River region.
   ``It's a part of history that we're Sleepy Hollow,'' said Chris
Skelly, a member of the Village of Sleepy Hollow Committee. ``It's
not a made-up name. It gives us the potential to be famous because
everyone's heard of Sleepy Hollow.''
   Skelly said Irving, for whom nearby Irvington was named, didn't
make up the name, but reached back to 17th century Dutch
descriptions of the area. Dutch pioneers dubbed the area ``sleepy''
because it was easy to dock along the riverside and spend the night.
   Proponents of the change say a new name would distinguish their
8,000-resident community from neighboring Tarrytown and would bring
in tourist money to help local business and tax base, which has
suffered in recent years.
   Opponents say it would be confusing and costly and wouldn't
accomplish anything.
   ``History will not pay the bills or solve the problems,'' said
Edna Belanich, a founder of Concerned Citizens Against Changing the
Name of North Tarrytown. ``We can keep history in our hearts.''

   The campaigns of both Jesse Jackson and Pat
Robertson face a critical question as they move into the Super
Tuesday contests _ whether they have been able to expand their
traditional bases of support.
   Both need to attract more than protest votes from those who want
to ``send a message'' to the more mainstream candidates.
   While Jackson has shown he can attract substantial votes outside
the black community, analysts still question whether Robertson can
move beyond his fundamentalist Christian base.
   A crucial test for Robertson takes place Saturday when South
Carolina Republicans vote in a presidential primary in which he
once said he would beat George Bush and Bob Dole convincingly.
   ``If I lose this one, then I'm in trouble,'' Robertson said of
South Carolina after his fifth-place finish in New Hampshire.
   The South Carolina contest comes three days before Super
Tuesday, the March 8 showdown when 20 states, concentrated in the
South, hold primaries or caucuses.
   Jackson and Robertson both have strong bases in the region, but
each needs to reach beyond his core constituency.
   Robertson startled many Republicans with a strong second-place
finish in Iowa and was second again in South Dakota and Minnesota.
   Opinion polls in South Carolina show the former television
evangelist running third.
   Jackson also was second in Minnesota and followed that with
similar showings in Maine and Vermont _ all states with very small
minority populations. In each state, the winner was Gov. Michael
Dukakis of Massachusetts.
   Ann Lewis, a political adviser to Jackson, argues that he has
``gone from being a protest candidate to being a message
candidate.'' Ms. Lewis said Jackson's message this campaign is far
different from what he was saying in 1984.
   ``The last time he talked a lot about the party process and
being locked out,'' she said. ``His message this time is economic
and inclusive.''
   Pollster Peter Hart said he believes Jackson has moved to what
he called ``the polarizing mainstream.''
   ``To suggest he is just like (Rep. Richard) Gephardt or Dukakis
is probably incorrect,'' said Hart.
   The pollster said that his surveys show that about 85 out of 100
Democrats would consider voting for Gephardt or Dukakis, but the
number drops to 60 out of 100 when asked about Jackson.
   Hart said the mix he has found among white supporters of Jackson
is people who are younger, more liberal and in some cases
economically dispossessed.
   Republican pollster Lance Tarrance, who has been working for
Rep. Jack Kemp, said his surveys in South Carolina and elsewhere in
the South find ``Pat Robertson hasn't quite created the brush fire
we thought.''
   He said Robertson needed to get support from the
``non-establishment vote _ we don't have anti-establishment people
in the Republican Party.''
   So far, he said, that hasn't happened. One reason he cited was
that Bush ``has held together a lot stronger than we had hoped.''
   Analyst William Schneider of the American Enterprise Institute,
a Washington think tank, said Jackson's white support ``tends to be
the radical-chic votes'' _ affluent young liberals.
   He said those are voters who are turned on by what he called
``the Democratic revival speech,'' a statement of traditional party
values.
   ``Jesse Jackson is the only one in the race now who can give the
Democratic revival speech,'' said Schneider. He cited Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York as
non-candidates who deliver the same sort of speech.
   Schneider said that while Gephardt appeals to blue-collar voters
``he's not selling himself as a liberal.'' He said Gephardt also is
hurt because people who still want to hear that appeal demand
authenticity.
   ``Fundamantalist believers (in that message) don't flip-flop,''
said Schneider.
   As for Robertson, Schneider said, ``The base of his support is
the limit of his support.''
   Political scientist Norman Ornstein of AEI, said he is
``skeptical that this is some dramatic expansion of Jackson's
base.''
   He said the Vermont and Maine results were examples of contests
where there was ``a low turnout with a real emphasis on the issue
activists.''
   ``Jackson's positions are going to be very attractive to issue
activists whether they are white or black,'' said Ornstein.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's vow to veto a sweeping
civil rights bill puts him on a collision course with Congress,
which has overwhelmingly endorsed the landmark measure expanding
protections against discrimination.
   Groups ranging from the U.S. Catholic Conference to the National
Women's Law Center hailed the 315-98 vote Wednesday by which the
House sent the Civil Rights Restoration Act on its way to the White
House.
   ``It was a tremendous bipartisan victory for civil rights,''
said Ralph Neas, executive director of the 200-group Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights. Republicans opposed the measure by a
slight margin, but just four of the majority Democrats voted
against it.
   The bill, which some veteran lawmakers likened to the great
civil rights statutes passed in the 1960s and 1970s, requires
entire colleges, school systems, government agencies and private
entities to comply with anti-discrimination laws if any program or
activity within them receives federal money.
   Congress has been struggling with the bill since 1984, when a
Supreme Court decision limited the reach of laws protecting women,
minorities, the elderly and the disabled to the specific program or
activity receiving federal aid.
   In letters to House Republicans, Reagan said the bill
``dramatically expands the scope of federal jurisdiction over state
and local governments and the private sector'' and ``poses a
particular threat to religious liberty.''
   ``I will veto the bill if it is presented to me in its current
form,'' Reagan said.
   Both chambers passed the civil rights measure by the two-thirds
majority needed to override a presidential veto. Neas said he is
confident the margins will hold if Reagan goes through with the
veto.
   ``He's backed down on a lot of things he's said before,'' Judith
Lichtman, director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, said of
Reagan. ``It's hard to predict what he'll do this time.''
   The 6-3 Supreme Court decision came in a case brought by Grove
City (Pa.) College. The ruling said only the student aid office was
subject to the Title IX statute barring sex discrimination in
education because student financial assistance was the only aid
flowing into the college.
   The result has been what one lawmaker called ``an avalanche of
discrimination nationwide'' _ hundreds of cases restricted or
dropped, and investigators preoccupied with tracking federal
dollars instead of determining if discrimination has occurred.
   Opponents of the restoration act said it would have far-reaching
and unintended consequences on churches, businesses and
individuals. Supporters said it merely restores rights and
principles long ago approved by Congress when it resolved that
taxpayers should not subsidize discrimination.
   ``Those who dip their hands in the public till should not object
if a little democracy sticks to their fingers,'' summed up Rep.
Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education and
Labor Committee.
   Before passing the bill, the House voted 266-146 against a GOP
substitute that would have scaled back the measure's impact on
corporations and allowed more schools to avoid compliance with
civil rights laws on religious grounds.
   The final bill also contains a Senate amendment that invalidates
Title IX regulations barring discrimination against women who have
had or sought abortions and requiring college health plans to cover
abortions if they cover other temporary disabilities.
   Several House members who supported the bill said they regretted
that it included the anti-abortion provision. The National
Right-To-Life Committee called it a significant victory while the
Catholic Conference called it ``an essential improvement.''
   The restoration act says entire institutions and government
agencies must comply with anti-discrimination statutes if any
program or activity within them receives federal aid. The broad
coverage also applies to the private sector if the aid goes to a
corporation as a whole or if the recipient principally provides
education, health care, housing, social services or parks and
recreation.
   The bill also says farmers getting crop subsidies, people on
food stamps and other individuals receiving federal assistance are
not required to comply with the anti-discrimination statutes.
   The four civil rights laws affected by the Supreme Court ruling
were Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments, barring sex
discrimination in federally funded education programs; the 1964
Civil Rights Act, barring racial discrimination in
federally-assisted programs; the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, barring
discrimination against the handicapped in any program or activity
receiving federal aid; and the 1975 Age Discrimination Act, barring
employment discrimination against older people.
   The House passed the restoration act in similar form on a vote
of 375-32 in 1984, shortly after the court decision. The bill was
bottled up in a Senate committee until last year.

injuring 34, police said.
   The private bus crashed Tuesday near Pucara, 510 miles north of
Lima, police said Wednesday.
   Police said many of the passengers were tossed from the rolling

<HEAD>Foreign Fund Withdrawals Could Bring Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People in other countries have invested $1.5
trillion in the United States and withdrawals could bring a
recession, a former top Treasury official says.
   C. Fred Bergsten, who now heads the Institute for International
Economics, a study group financed largely by the West German
Marshall Fund, issued the warning on Wednesday.
   Bergsten said the investment by other countries in the United
States is in private hands.
   ``Some of it's in the form of plant and equipment _ that's not
going to come out rapidly,'' he told the House Budget Committee.
``But close to a trillion dollars of it is liquid, and about half a
trillion has come in just the last five years to finance our
massive trade deficits.
   ``On future occasions, if foreigners withdrew money, the effect
on interest rates, our economy, the exchange rate, could be much
more dramatic.''
   It has happened before, he said.
   ``The last time the dollar fell sharply _ I happen to remember
painfully because I was in the Treasury at the time _ was in the
late 1970s,'' he added.
   He was then assistant secretary of the Treasury for
international affairs. He recalled that the United States had to
borrow about twice the amount of its trade deficit because
foreigners were withdrawing money at the same time.
   ``If we got anything like that magnitude now, we'd have to find
a way to borrow $300 billion from foreign officials or somewhere to
keep our books in balance,'' he said. ``That could only be done at
prices that would bring the whole economy to a shuddering halt.''
   He said the most enduring legacy of the Reagan administration
would be the conversion of the United States from the world's
biggest creditor country to the biggest debtor. Current foreign
borrowing by the U.S. government is about $150 billion a year.
   ``At the end of 1987, our net international debt stood at about
$400 billion, more than the external red ink of the next three
largest debtors _ Canada, Brazil and Mexico _ combined,'' he said.
   ``Under the most optimistic adjustment scenario, that number
will rise to $750 billion before it could possibly level off, and a
more likely outcome is much closer to $1 trillion.''
   Bergsten said the United States needs to shift its annual
international trade balance by about $200 billion, more than the
current deficit, because the additional cost of interest on the
foreign debt will be close to $50 billion by the early 1990s. It
would be reasonable to try to reach this target in four or five
years, he said.
   He said it can be done only by cutting the federal budget
deficit by $150 to $200 billion in the same period. He added that
unless these cuts can be made, the value of the dollar against
other currencies could easily fall by another 20 percent or 30
percent.

   The Episcopalian archbishop of Liberia,
the Most Rev. George Browne, said authorities prevented him from
leaving the country.
   Browne, an outspoken critic of the government of President
Samuel Doe, said Wednesday that he was stopped at the country's
international airport on Saturday by officials who prevented him
from boarding his plane.
   He said he wrote to Justice Minister Jenkins Scott for an
explanation but had yet to receive a reply. Browne said he was
going to neighboring Guinea to ordain some priests when he was
stopped.
   Doe, a former master sergeant, took power in a military coup in

<TEXT>
   News reports and television
footage of Israeli troops storming hospital wards, schoolrooms and
mosques in the occupied lands to quash Arab rioting have tarnished
Israel's image abroad.
   But Israeli officials hotly retort, and they are supported by
witnesses, that Palestinian protesters have used these institutions
as havens to escape arrest and as staging grounds for more
demonstrations.
   Israelis say this is a deliberate tactic aimed at eliciting
foreign condemnation by provoking troops to attack institutions
usually considered outside the realm of conflict.
   On Wednesday, a dozen Arab teen-agers erected several barricades
30 feet from the front of the Ramallah Hospital emergency room and
threw stones at Israeli soldiers.
   The army responded with tear gas and one canister landed in the
hospital, forcing dozens of elderly patients to flee, gagging and
covering their faces with clothing.
   ``Provoking the army to enter a hospital is a propaganda coup
for the Palestinians,'' said Brig. Gen. Arye Shalev, who was the
military governor of the West Bank from 1974 to 1976.
   ``In the war of public opinion, hospitals, schools and mosques
are symbols. They are sensitive spots. To enter a hospital by force
with bullets and gas looks very bad,'' said Shalev, now working at
Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.
   In the 1982 Lebanon war, Palestinian guerrillas frequently
positioned rocket launchers and anti-aircraft batteries near
hospitals and residential apartment buildings, using them as
screens in battles with Israeli soldiers.
   Troops firing tear gas, rubber bullets and occasionally even
live ammunition have broken into hospitals in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip at least seven times since the unrest began Dec. 8,
according to witnesses.
   Troops killed two Arabs inside Shifa Hospital's walled compound
in December after rioters used the courtyard of the Gaza City
hospital as a fortress for hurling firebombs and rocks at soldiers.
Community leaders had held a strategy session in the hospital
director's office beforehand.
   Young Palestinian riot leaders also have used mosques as refuges
from soldiers and seized control of some to attack Israeli targets.
   In Nablus' Al Nasr mosque last Friday, an Arab youth in a denim
jacket led prayers while wearing a white cloth mask with eye slits
to conceal his face.
   Standing on the filigree prayer pulpit beside the outlawed
Palestinian flag, he shook his fists. ``This is the time we have to
use the mosques to launch a holy war,'' he told 200 West Bank
worshipers.
   In Jerusalem and the West Bank, mosque loudspeakers several
times have broadcast false reports that Jewish settlers were on a
rampage, prompting Arab residents to pour into the streets. One
Palestinian was killed in Tulkarem last month in an ensuing riot.
   There have been several protests following Friday noon prayers
at the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, one of Islam's holiest sites.
In January, riot police fired tear gas inside the mosque after
worshippers attacked a policeman, witnesses said. The incident
inflamed Palestinian anger here and in neighboring Jordan.
   Until the army shut down schools with 250,000 students in the
occupied lands in February, they were staging grounds for protests
involving children as young as age 6, who pelted Israeli troops and
cars with stones.
   In Nablus, nurses at Al Ittihad Hospital say protesters
frequently hide in the hospital after demonstrations. Last
Thursday, some nurses helped two protesters elude detection by
dressing them in white nurses jackets.
   ``We gave them white gowns like ours,'' said a 22-year-old male
nurse who refused to give his name. ``They're lucky they were not
asked questions about medicine. The soldiers do that sometimes to
make sure we really are nurses.''
   While hospitals, schools and mosques have provided some
protection for Arab protesters, the tactic also has endangered
bystanders.
   Ahmed Mahmoud Abdul Rahman, 20, who was recovering from an
appendectomy at Al Ittihad, said he was forced from his bed and
questioned for 30 minutes.
   ``They took me onto the street. They hit me on the legs and kept
asking, `Why are you in the hospital?''' said Abdul Rahman.
``Because I didn't have a cast or bandages or any obvious injury,
they suspected I had thrown rocks and was hiding out in the
hospital.''
   Doctors said that, in the same incident, troops searching for
Arabs suspected of throwing rocks and firebombs broke into an
operating room where a gunshot victim was being treated.
   As hospitals have become part of the battleground, Palestinian
doctors say some injured Arabs stay away from them for fear of
being detained.
   The director of Ramallah hospital, Yassir Obeid, said soldiers
struck him and another doctor in the chest and abdomen Tuesday when
Obeid asked to see an order authorizing the troops to enter the
hospital.
   Obeid said he saw the soldiers detain and beat a 10-year-old boy
who had been in the doctor's office waiting for a check-up.
   ``That boy had done nothing, he was in my office,'' Obeid said
in an interview. ``When I tried to explain to the soldiers, one hit
me in the chest with his rifle.''

   Southwest Airlines had the best record while
Eastern Airlines and Northwest Airlines shared the burden of having
the poorest on-time performance in January, according to the
monthly government statistics on flight delays.
   The Transportation Department figures released Wednesday showed
about three out of every ten flights arrived at least 15 minutes
late during the month, slightly fewer than in December.
   Southwest, which consistently has been among the best on-time
performers, had 85 percent of its flights arrive on time during
January, followed by America West and Pacific Southwest Airlines,
both of which had a better than 80 percent on-time performance.
   Eastern airlines had the worst record, with 61.5 percent of its
flights arriving on time, followed close behind by Northwest's 61.6
percent. Piedmont Airlines, which also had the highest baggage
complaint rate during the month, was third from the bottom with a
62.4 percent on-time record.
   Overall the 14 airlines that are monitored in the monthly report
had 69.2 percent of their flights arriving within 15 minutes of
schedule, compared with 66.4 percent in December.
   The government considers a flight to be on time if it arrives
within 15 minutes of schedule. The 14 airlines that are required to
submit monthly on-time statistics are not required to report delays
attributed to mechanical problems. Delays due to weather are
counted.
   During January, there were 148 chronically late flights, meaning
they were late at least 80 percent of the time. Four of those
flights _ two for Continental and one each for Northwest and Delta
Airlines _ were late each time the planes flew.
   Meanwhile, consumer complaints to the Transportation Department
dropped sharply in February, compared with the previous month, but
still were higher than the number recorded in February 1987, the
department said.
   The complaint statistics are released with the on-time
performance statistics, although they cover different months.
   There were 2,235 complaints received by the department's
consumer affairs office about airline service during February,
compared with 3,610 in January, a decline of 38 percent. The
department received 1,574 such complaints in February 1987.
   The three airlines that had the most complaints lodged against
them in the two previous months _ Continental, Eastern and
Northwest _ led the list again in February. There were 14.79
complaints per 100,000 passengers involving Continental, 11.3
complaints involving Eastern and 10.64 complaints involving
Northwest, the deparment said.
   After Southwest, the airlines with the best on-time performance
in January were America West, which also was No. 2 in December, and
Pacific Southwest Airlines, which soared from last among the 14
airlines in December to having the third best record in January.
   America West had 83.9 percent of its flights arrive on time in
January while Pacific Southwest improved its record from 57.6 in
December to 81.6 in January. American Airlines (75.7 percent) had
the best record among the larger carriers, but Pan American World
Airways dropped from having the second best record in December to
seventh in January.
   The best arrival rate among the 27 airports from which reporting
is required came at Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport and
the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport with just over 78 percent of the
flights arriving on time. The worst arrival rate, 59.1 percent, was
reported at Orlando International Airport in Florida.
   During January, the number of baggage complaints received by the
airlines remained virtually the same as the previous month with
11.58 complaints per 1,000 passengers flown. Piedmont Airlines had
just over 18 such complaints, the most of any of the airlines,
while Southwest had the least at 4.65.

   Paul Simon has come home to Illinois to fight for
his life as a Democratic presidential contender. He's doing it
without television, without big bucks and without many words of
encouragement from political pundits.
   While the rest of the presidential pack stalks votes in Super
Tuesday land, the Illinois senator is hoping a homegrown victory
will revive his flagging campaign following a string of
disappointing showings in early contests.
   ``We have to win, and we will win in Illinois,'' Simon said at a
news conference on Wednesday. After a fund-raising foray to
California, he said he planned to remain here, for the most part,
until the Illinois primary on March 15.
   Some have dubbed him ``Simple Simon'' for choosing to skip the
South on the 20-state Super Tuesday. Others have called him gutsy.
But Simon remains upbeat and says his strategy will pay off in the
end.
   ``The Super Tuesday of the industrial states starts with
Illinois,'' he said. ``Illinois is going to send a strong message
to the industrial states and to the rest of the nation on behalf of
Paul Simon.''
   Simon strongly denied reports that he was talking to Michael
Dukakis about dropping out of the race and supporting the
Massachusetts governor.
   ``I've never talked to Mike Dukakis about any such
possibility,'' Simon said. ``It's strictly a figment of someone's
imagination.''
   Simon also denied reports that his Illinois supporters have
pressured him to stay in the race so that they can be guaranteed a
trip to the July convention in Atlanta.
   ``I wouldn't be doing it just so somebody can get a vacation in
Atlanta,'' Simon said. ``I'm in it because I want to be president
of the United States.''
   He needs a heavy voter turnout to win in Illinois, and even
there the cards seem stacked against him. There are no statewide
contests to draw voters to the polls, and not many local races.
   ``There are few races throughout Illinois and, therefore, that
may tend to keep voters' interest down,'' said Vince Demuzio, the
state party chairman who discussed strategy with Simon earlier
Wednesday.
   The state party has not endorsed a presidential candidate,
partly because two favorite sons are in the sweepstakes _ Jesse
Jackson is the other _ and partly because it generally stays out of
presidential primaries, Demuzio said.
   Simon ``is and will be campaigning all over Illinois over the
next several days'' to try to spark a heavy turnout, Demuzio said
in a telephone interview Wednesday night.
   Faced with a heavy campaign debt, Simon will be unable to launch
a media blitz to get his message across to voters. Instead, he'll
focus on stumping across the state.
   ``Abe Lincoln didn't do TV,'' said Simon spokesman Michael
Kreloff.
   ``If we had a million dollars in the bank right now, which we do
not, I'm not sure (TV ads) would be a prudent expenditure,'' Simon
said.
   Kreloff said that while other candidates will have to rely on
television ads in Illinois, ``Paul Simon is a known quantity here.''
   ``He's been in Illinois now for over three decades. He has 100
percent name recognition,'' Demuzio said. ``Why spend a great deal
of money on media in your home state when they're aware of who you
are?''
   Simon acknowledged that his financial situation is ``not
great,'' but said recent fund-raisers have helped erase some of his
campaign debt. He said he did not know how much money was left in
his campaign coffers.
   The senator would not discuss what he will do if he doesn't win
in Illinois.
   ``You're talking about something that isn't going to happen.
We're going to win in Illinois,'' he said.

   The Tennessee Senate has invited David
Letterman to visit Memphis, where the NBC talk show host could
``beat his feet on the Mississippi Mud.''
   In a resolution passed Wednesday, the Senate gave 10 reasons for
the host of ``Late Night with David Letterman'' to visit. Among
them:
   ``Dave could beat his feet on the Mississippi Mud,''' the
resolution suggested. ``Dave could visit Graceland, the world's
only shrine equipped with a jungle room. ... Dave could visit the
Living Legend Jerry Lee Lewis and his Great Balls of Fire.''
   Letterman could ``witness the Peabody Ducks, the world's most
famous and longest-running Stupid Pet Tricks,'' the resolution said.
   Among the hallmark's of Letterman's show is stupid pet tricks,
featuring pets and their owners. Every day, the ducks, which live
in a penthouse at the Peabody Hotel, are taken by elevator to a
fountain in the lobby.

for leukemia and has returned to his home in Barcelona, hospital
officials say.
   Carreras, 41, received four months of treatment at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center for acute lymphocytic leukemia,
including a Nov. 16 bone marrow transplant. He was free of the
disease when discharged Friday, spokeswoman Susan Edmonds said
Wednesday.
   Ms. Edmonds said Carreras had discussed returning to Seattle for

   Carreras will remain under a physician's care in Spain, and is
to return to Seattle for a checkup in a year. People with acute
lymphocytic leukemia, an especially severe form of the disease,
have a survival rate of about 25 percent to 40 percent over three

   Millionaire philanthropist Armand Hammer wants
to wipe out cancer by the year 2000, and is leading a campaign to
raise $1 billion a year for research on the killer disease.
   Hammer said he hopes to raise $500 million in private
contributions, then have that matched by federal funds. Some
members of Congress already have agreed to support the effort, he
said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   Hammer, chairman and chief executive officer of Occidental
Petroleum Corp., already has donated $100,000 for cancer research
and has received commitments from nine other industrialists to do
the same.
   The money will go directly to research at the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md., said Hammer, a non-practicing physician
who turns 90 in May. ``There will be no overhead charges,'' he said.
   The institute's annual research budget is $1.4 billion.

   About one in 500 American women giving birth is
infected with the AIDS virus, a study published today suggests.
   The authors used a survey of blood samples routinely taken from
newborn babies to help estimate the scope of AIDS infection. Most
surveys of AIDS infection have concentrated on male homosexuals,
drug addicts and others at high risk of catching the disease.
   ``This paper gives a more accurate way to judge the scope of the
epidemic in women,'' said Dr. Rodney Hoff. ``Nothing else comes
close to this in being able to measure the prevalence in the United
States.''
   The study found that one of every 476 women giving birth, or 2.1
for each 1,000, were infected with the virus. However, this varied
greatly, depending on where they lived.
   At three inner-city Boston hospitals, eight per 1,000 were
infected. In suburban and rural hospitals, just under one per 1,000
carried the virus.
   Hoff directed the study of Massachusetts women at the state
Department of Public Health using tiny samples of blood routinely
drawn from babies to check for phenylketonuria, or PKU, and other
diseases.
   Dr. George F. Grady, the state epidemiologist, said the state's
infection rate probably mirrors the nation's, because the rate of
actual AIDS cases in Massachusetts is virtually the same as
throughout United States.
   He said the low suburban and rural infection rate in
Massachusetts is likely similar across much of the United States.
   ``I think it is not higher than that, and probably lower, in
less coastal and less urban states than Massachusetts,'' Grady said.
   Dr. Timothy Dondero, chief of AIDS surveillance at the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control, cautioned against placing too much
emphasis on the Massachusetts data.
   ``It's not scientifically wise to try to make a national
projection from one or two points,'' he said.
   Dondero noted that a similar study conducted in New York, which
has more AIDS cases than any other state, found a significantly
higher level of infection. The New York State Health Department
study indicated about one in every 116 women giving birth in the
state carried the AIDS virus.
   The Massachusetts research was based on anonymous AIDS antibody
testing on 30,708 babies born in Massachusetts during the first six
months of last year. The results were published in the New England
Journal of Medicine.
   The researchers assumed that the babies received the antibodies
_ but not necessarily the infection _ from mothers who carried the
AIDS virus. Dondero said about 40 percent of babies of
AIDS-infected women get the infection.
   Projecting the Massachusetts figures nationally, the doctors
calculated that if as few as 20 percent of babies of AIDS carriers
get the virus, then 1,620 AIDS-infected infants are born in the
United States annually. If the figure is as high as 60 percent,
then 4,860 infected children are born in a year.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. As of Feb. 29, the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta had received reports of 54,723 Americans with
AIDS, 30,715 of whom had died.

   A judge's ruling that the Gov. Mario Cuomo's
administration blacklisted construction companies and then allowed
them to buy their way off the list is ``a personal assault on my
integrity,'' says the state's transportation commissioner.
   Justice Harold Hughes of the trial-level state Supreme Court
cited federal extortion laws Wednesday in refusing to dismiss a
lawsuit filed by paving companies that challenged, among other
things, state-imposed affirmative action requirements on
contractors.
   Hughes did not say that any crimes had been committed by
officials but that he was referring the case to federal and state
prosecutors and the state's Commission on Goverment Integrity for
review.
   State Transportation Commissioner Franklin White, one of the
administration's highest-ranking blacks, characterized Hughes'
decision as ``a personal assault on my integrity as a public
official and I'm outraged by it.''
   White denied any blacklist for contractors existed and said the
ruling will be appealed immediately.
   The lawsuit was filed by the New York State Asphalt Pavement
Association, which represents 34 contractors, against White and
state Office of General Services Commissioner John Egan.
   In denying a state motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Hughes said
one company had agreed to pay $150,000 to benefit the state's
Disadvantaged, Minority, Women's Business Enterprise Program to get
off the blacklist.
   ``Compelling contractors to enter into the agreements ...
constitutes unethical and possibly criminal conduct,'' Hughes wrote
in his eight-page opinion.
   Hughes said that as part of the agreements, the companies had to
promise not to sue the state over their blacklisting.
   The lawsuit stems from White's attempt to crack down on
contractors who are not meeting state and federal minority hiring
requirements, or who have established ``front'' companies that
falsely claim to be minority owned, or who have engaged in criminal
activity such as bid-rigging.
   White has moved against companies under criminal investigation
or that have been convicted of crimes that relate to public works
projects.
   State courts recently have ruled against some of DOT's attempts
to force minority hiring by contractors. Those decisions are on
appeal.
   White's spokesman, Timothy Hulbert, said there was nothing
illegal about barring contractors from doing business with the
state if they had violated state laws or regulations. He said that
was done only on a ``case-by-case basis'' and denied a blacklist
was maintained.
   He also said there was nothing illegal about having those
companies pay money to improve minority hiring programs as part of
any agreements for them to get back in the state's good graces.

<HEAD>Grass-Roots Drive Gives Robertson Victory In Alaska Caucuses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A grass-roots campaign focusing on
contributors to his former television ministry helped give Pat
Robertson a 2-to-1 victory over Vice President George Bush in the
Alaska Republican precinct caucuses.
   Robertson claimed 47 percent of the votes compared to Bush's 24
percent in a preference poll of 2,020 delegates elected at the
precinct level. Sen. Bob Dole took third with 20 percent and Jack
Kemp trailed at 7 percent, party officials announced Wednesday.
   Robertson's effort was a low-cost affair concentrating on
telephone canvassers and volunteers handing out pamphlets and
inspirational cassette tapes at shopping malls, said Walter Wood,
Robertson's statewide coordinator.
   The focus was on getting ``disenfranchised'' voters involved in
the political process, Wood said. It helped to have lists of
contributors to the Christian Broadcast Network, which Robertson
headed before starting his presidential campaign, he said.
   ``You go where your strength is,'' Wood said. ``It yielded us
some great benefits. Our sparks would start with the church and
then they would expand out. Get beyond the label of television
evangelist, and people perk up. He's got answers.''
   Other campaign coordinators vowed to turn things around as the
delegate selection process continues.
   ``These delegates aren't bound'' to Robertson, said Frank
Bickford, state coordinator for the Dole campaign. ``There will be
a chance to pick up delegates.''
   Clifford Groh, Bush's state coordinator, said that campaign
could have done better with an investment of ``time and effort,
maybe a little money, too.'' The Bush campaign put less than $1,000
into the caucus effort, he said.
   Bickford said the Dole campaign spent about $25,000. Wood did
not reveal the cost of Robertson's campaign, but said it was
considerably less than $25,000.
   The 2,020 precinct delegates will be winnowed later this month
to 400 district delegates, who then will choose 19 delegates to
attend the national convention in August.
   Allegiances can shift among the precinct and district delegates,
but GOP delegates to the national conventions have never abandoned
their chosen candidates, said Jim Crawford, chairman of the Alaska
Republican Party.
   Nearly 4,000 of the state's 55,000 registered Republicans turned
out for the caucuses, held throughout the state from Saturday to
Tuesday, Crawford said.
   ``There were a lot of strange faces,'' said Linda Shafer,
volunteer media coordinator for the party. ``There were people new
to the political process. You could tell by their political
platforms _ things like anti-marijuana and anti-abortion _ that
they were church folks.''
   Alaska, with only 19 of the 2,270 delegates at the national
Republican convention, has not been a high priority for the
candidates. None has made a campaign stop here.

<HEAD>Committee Approves Giving Banks New Securities Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation granting banks broad new
securities powers cleared its first big hurdle after two days of
contentious debate behind closed doors by the Senate Banking
Committee.
   The committee voted 18-2 late Wednesday night to repeal most of
the Glass-Steagall Act, which has separated commercial banking from
the securities business since the Depression.
   But the approval came only after Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
pushed through an unrelated amendment limiting the ability of banks
to expand into the insurance business.
   The bill faces a vote in the full Senate. Similar legislation
still must pass the House, where two powerful committee chairmen,
Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.,
have expressed great skepticism about expanding bank powers too
much.
   However, Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., said the lopsided
committee approval of the compromise package improves the chances
for its enactment.
   The vote ``means a good strong bill will not only pass the
Senate but will survive in conference,'' he said.
   The legislation, as orginally proposed by Proxmire and Sen. Jake
Garn of Utah, the panel's senior Republican, addressed only
securities powers.
   But, Dodd, who represents a state where insurance companies are
important employers, added a new element to the debate that
stalemated the committee for two days. He successfully pushed for
closing several loopholes that have permitted some banks to enter
insurance in states which authorize that.
   Under the bill adopted by the committee, bank holding companies
would be permitted to underwrite and sell mortgage-backed
securities, commercial paper and municipal revenue bonds
immediately after enactment of the bill. They would be allowed to
underwrite and sell corporate bonds and mutual funds six months
after enactment.
   However, a separate vote by Congress by April 1, 1991, would be
required before banks could deal in corporate stocks.
   Dodd said he did not obtain everything he wanted, but Paul A.
Equale, a lobbyist for the Independent Insurance Agents of America,
said, ``We think Chris Dodd did a terrific job.''
   Under the insurance compromise, bank holding companies could
deal in insurance in states that authorize it, provided those
activities are limited to that state. The bill imposes no
restrictions on state banks not owned by holding companies.
   Bank holding companies could not sell insurance through banks
located in another state. A loophole that had permitted some
national banks to deal in insurance would be closed.
   The committee left to the Senate as a whole a decision on
whether several states could agree to allow each others' banks to
engage in insurance activities across state borders.
   The Glass-Steagall Act was passed in the wake of the 1929 stock
market crash to preserve the safety of the banking system during
future market downturns. But banks have argued that the
internationalization of financial markets and the development of
new securities products have made the Glass-Steagall barriers
outdated.
   Voting for the compromise bill were Proxmire; Garn; Dodd; and
Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich.; Paul
Sarbanes, D-Md.; Alan Dixon, D-Ill.; James Sasser, D-Tenn.; Terry
Sanford, D-N.C.; Richard Shelby, D-Ala.; Bob Graham, D-Fla.;
Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.; John Heinz, R-Pa.; William Armstrong,
R-Colo.; Chic Hecht, R-Nev.; Christopher Bond, R-Mo.; John Chaffee,
R-R.I., and David Karnes, R-Neb.
   Voting against the bill were Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and
Phil Gramm, R-Texas.

on condition of anonymity, said the dollar's strength was due
partly to a Japanese news report that a senior U.S. monetary
official in Washington had suggested the United States would
tolerate a considerable rise in the value of the dollar if the
nation's trade deficit kept improving.
   The dollar had traded below 129 yen in Tokyo since Feb. 23.

   Panama's attorney general said
Washington accused Panama of not helping fight drug trafficking
only because the United States has been unable to win its own war
against drugs at home.
   Attorney General Carlos Villalaz' statement Wednesday followed
by a day the U.S. government's denial to Panama of certification as
a nation doing its best against the drug trade.
   Villalaz said Washington had misrepresented the facts for
political ends.
   ``It seems illogical that U.S. politicians, upon being unable to
win the domestic war waged because of the large-scale consumption
of drugs in their country, would pretend to resolve the problem by
telling their electorate that the responsibility is Panama's,''
said Villalaz's statement.
   Lack of certification means an end to U.S. military and economic
aid, but aid to Panama was cut off last year. It also could mean
withdrawal of U.S. support for Panamanian requests for loans from
the World Bank and other international agencies, but no
applications are pending.
   ``Having ... the evidence and reports that demonstrate that 1987
was the most successful year for joint (anti-narcotics) operations
between Panama and the United States, I declare that the current
attitude of the North American government is inconceivable,
illogical and immoral,'' the statement said.
   It said drug arrests, confiscation of drugs and seizure of
profits from narcotics sales had increased, and noted reports by
U.S. officials in 1987 praising the zeal of Panamanian officials.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, chief of the Panama's 15,000-member
Defense Forces and de factor ruler, was indicted in Florida last
month on trafficking charges.
   Noriega has denied the drug trafficking accusations and claims
they are part of a U.S. plot to renege on its agreement to turn
over the Panama Canal to Panama by the year 2000.
   ``We have told the Americans time and again that, if they want
to wipe out drug trafficking, they must be serious and set politics
aside so that it does not interfere with stopping drugs,'' said the
statement.
   ``Nevertheless, it would seem that the attitude of the American
government is intended to dishearten its allies in the fight
against drugs, giving incentive to the traffickers and destroying
even more its own youth.

   His flash and frenzy undiminished by time,
Little Richard took over the Grammy Awards ceremony and was still
in outrageous high spirits when he met reporters on the seventh
floor of Radio City Music Hall.
   Hitting one of those fabulous high notes from his rock
repertoir, Little Richard laughed and said, ``I'm going to scream
like a white woman.''
   Little Richard wasn't there Wednesday night to win a Grammy, but
to present one.
   ``And the best new artist is _ me!'' he announced. ``I have
never received nuthin' _ y'all never gave me no Grammys, and I've
been singing for years.''
   ``I am the architect of rock 'n' roll,'' he shouted as his
flustered co-presenter, Buster Poindexter, looked on and the crowd
rose in a standing ovation. ``I am the originator!''
   Little Richard repeated that he was the winner, but finally gave
the Grammy to Jody Watley.
   Backstage, he sang the praises of Michael Jackson's performance
on the telecast.
   ``I cried. `The Man in the Mirror,' I just love that,'' Little
Richard said. ``I felt that. My big toe just shot up in my boot.''
   Asked if he was surprised that Jackson didn't win any of the
four Grammys for which he was nominated, Little Richard's face
expressed horror. ``I'm shocked. Stunned. I think a whole lot of
people are. I've never seen anything like Michael in my life.
   ``He is a hard worker. He gives his all. He don't hold nothing
back. He puts it all out there and you can pull it wherever you
want to carry it.''
   Asked how long he'd been bitter at never receiving a Grammy,
Little Richard said, ``I'm not bitter, but it would be nice to have
one.''
   Born Richard Penniman on Dec. 5, 1932, Little Richard broke into
rock _ smashed might be a better word _ in 1955 with
``Tutti-Frutti,'' and followed up with ``Long Tall Sally'' and
``Slippin' and Slidin''' in 1956 and ``Good Golly, Miss Molly'' in
1958.
   He was the most outrageous of the early rockers with a 6-inch
pompadour, pancake makeup, a pencil-thin mustache and an all-out
attack on the piano.
   At the height of his fame, during a tour of Australia in 1957,
Little Richard got religion. According to one version he has told,
he had a horrifying dream of the apocalypse during an airplane
flight. Once safely on the ground, he threw his jewelry off the
Sydney Harbor Bridge.
   He came back to rock in 1964 with ``Bama Lama Bama Loo,'' and
more recently had an acting part in the film ``Down and Out in
Beverly Hills.'' Working with Bette Midler was fun, he said
Wednesday. ``The only thing that got me was the dog. He bit me.''
   In 1986, Little Richard announced he had converted to Judaism.
   Little Richard's on-stage tirade started when he accused
Poindexter (a.k.a. David Johansen) of stealing his upswept hairdo.
Later, Little Richard admitted he had borrowed one his trademarks _
that ``whooo.''
   ``I got that from (gospel singer) Clara Ward. I don't have to
pass it on; everybody done took it,'' he said. ``Michael is using
it. And they're welcome.''
   Asked whether he, Jackson and Prince could perform together,
Little Richard said he thought Jackson would be willing ``but I
think Prince would shoot me. I love Prince. I can talk to Michael.
He is very humble. I can get to Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Paul
McCartney. I just can't get to Prince.''
   His favorites? ``I like Michael, Bruce, Bob Seger, Prince. I
think Prince is a genius. I love Paul McCartney. I love all of
them. They come from me.''

<TEXT>
   The NAACP is moving a convention and
demanding an apology from a popular country club after a telephone
recording during which the club's manager allegedly made racial
slurs.
   The comments were recorded on the telephone answering machine of
Howard County NAACP member Sherman Howell, who had phoned the Turf
Valley Country Club last week to ask why it seemed no black waiters
and waitresses worked there.
   The Washington Post obtained a copy of the tape, and included
comments from the recording in an article in today's editions.
   According to the tape, a man identifying himself as club manager
Fred Grimmell returned the call, and left a short message on
Howell's answering machine. But then after a click, the voice
continued in a conversation with two other people and made several
racial slurs, the Post said.
   At one point, the voice on the tape said: ``This nigger, I am
going to put him against the wall ... He should say, `This is
Sherman Nigger.' Yo nigger, yo bub.'' As the man who had identified
himself as Grimmell and an unidentified woman discussed whether
Howell had ever visited the club's restaurant, a third voice said,
``Well, we don't like niggers. ... I'm discriminated because all
the niggers get all the jobs.''
   A black Washington Post reporter then went to interview
Grimmell, and heard another racial slur from behind closed doors
about a person ``that wants to grill me.''
   Later, the Post said, Grimmell told the reporter: ``I have no
time to talk to you at all. Here's the door, sweetheart. Our
conversation is over.''
   The Howard County NAACP chapter, which had planned to hold its
spring ``Freedom Fund'' meeting at the club on March 24, is moving
it elsewhere.
   Maryland NAACP President Rev. John Wright, at a news conference
Wednesday, said his organization is demanding Grimmell's immediate
resignation and an apology. The NAACP is also considering picketing
and demonstrations if the issue is not resolved quickly, Wright
said.
   ``This is 1988 and we have this type of statements... This is
blatant, outright racism,'' said Wright.
   Louis Mangoine, son of club owner Nick Mangione, said he would
investigate the complaints about Grimmell.

<HEAD>Robertson Wants To End Legal Fight, But Denies He Avoided Combat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GOP presidential candidate Pat Robertson isn't
retreating from his firm denial of charges he avoided combat in
Korea although he wants to end a legal battle with a former
congressman who made them.
   Robertson and his lawyer have formally announced plans to ask a
federal judge to dismiss the $35 million lawsuit against Rep. Paul
N. McCloskey Jr., R-Calif., to avoid beginning a three-week trial
on Super Tuesday.
   Going to trial next Tuesday means Robertson ``is being asked to
sacrifice his presidential campaign in order to vindicate his
personal honor,'' attorney Douglas Rigler told reporters Wednesday.
   ``We think that's extraordinarily unfair,'' Rigler said,
referring to U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green's refusal to
postpone the trial date until June 20, when the primary season has
ended.
   The decision to seek dismissal of the suit ``does not in any way
indicate he is unwilling to confront Mr. McCloskey or that he shies
away from any judicial determination of the merits of the
charges,'' Rigler said.
   ``Robertson does not intend to back away at any time from his
denial of the charges that Mr. McCloskey made,'' Rigler added.
   McCloskey, meanwhile, said Robertson is ``chickening out of the
trial just like he chickened out 37 years ago.''
   The former congressman's lawyer, George Lehner, said he would
oppose Robertson's motion to dismiss the lawsuit and request to
proceed with the trial on Tuesday.
   ``I think the truth ought to be told,'' McCloskey said. ``I
don't know any better place to get the truth than in the courtroom.
He invoked the process, he ought to go through with it.''
   McCloskey was sued in 1986 following publication of his charges
that Robertson called his father, the late Sen. A. Willis
Robertson, D-Va., from Japan to get out of combat in the Korean War.
   McCloskey, who was on the troop ship from which Robertson and
five other Marine officers were removed for special training, says
the former television evangelist later was the ``liquor officer''
to a rear-echelon unit in Korea.
   Rigler distributed a statement from Robertson saying ``the
pretrial process has already demonstrated the total falsity of Mr.
McCloskey's statements about me.''
   ``Not one of his witnesss ever heard me make such a call or
state that I had made it. The official records of the Marine Corps
fully supported my denial of ever having sought or received special
treatment,'' Robertson's statement said.
   A number of former Marines who were also aboard the USS
Breckinridge in 1951 have supported various parts of McCloskey's
story.
   A report on the case prepared by Rigler's office charged that
the pre-trial testimony of McCloskey's `` handful of volunteer
witnesses has been discredited. Mr. McCloskey has been reduced to
an admission that his charges constitute merely his `opinions' and
`impressions.'''
   By successfully opposing the motion to postpone the trial, ``Mr.
McCloskey is holding Mr. Robertson hostage,'' Rigler said.
``McCloskey knows that the March 8 date is impossible.''
   ``That is a terrible choice and I can't understand why a
respected judge did it,'' Rigler said.
   In her Jan. 6 order denying Robertson's motion, Green noted that
he filed the lawsuit and launched his candidacy ``at the same
time.''
   ``That these ventures might somehow come into conflct is a risk
that plaintiff assumed when he began them,'' the judge wrote.
   Under federal rules of civil procedure, the judge could order
Robertson to pay McCloskey's court costs and possibly legal fees.
   Rigler acknowledged that ``it is quite possible that Mr.
Robertson will be asked to pay a substantial amount of court
costs'' to cover the expense of taking depositions from more than
50 witnesses.
   But Rigler said he would be likely to appeal a large award.
   Lehner said he would ask the judge to order payment of
McCloskey's court costs and lawyers fees, which total more than
$400,000.

   Diana Ross says she still isn't talking with
Mary Wilson, her former partner in the Supremes.
   Talking with reporters at the 30th Annual Grammy Awards on
Wednesday, Miss Ross also said she wished she could have been at
the recent Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame banquet for the induction of
the Supremes.
   ``I wasn't able to get there. The baby, the whole thing, I
really couldn't get there,'' she said.
   Miss Wilson and a daughter of the third original Supreme, the
late Florence Ballard, attended the induction.
   Asked whether she and Miss Wilson are talking, Miss Ross said,
``No.''
   ``I'm really a good person,'' she added. ``I could be real good.
Somebody slaps you and slaps you and you'll still be good?''
   Told that Miss Wilson had said in Los Angeles that she's like to
renew the friendship, Miss Ross said, ``Of course she would feel
that way.''
   She said she hadn't read Miss Wilson's autobiography, ``but I
think she said kind of not really nice things. Insinuations in the
book were not nice to me. And I was really hurt by it.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama's hard-pressed economy has
become the focus of those trying to end the military rule of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle has joined other Noriega
foes in calling for fiscal actions to keep up pressure on the
government.
   Delvalle, who is in hiding, said in a videotape that the
political crisis in Panama would make it impossible for the nation
to get new loans from international agencies, and described the
country as ``totally bankrupt.''
   Nine months of political unrest already have eroded Panama's
service-oriented economy, which is particularly vulnerable to a
loss of trust and confidence caused by political upheaval.
   In addition, financial experts say billions of dollars in bank
deposits are being withdrawan from Panama, destablizing it as a
financial center.
   Manuel Solis Palma, installed last week to replace Delvalle,
charged that the United States ``wants to asphyxiate the Panamanian
people economically, snatching away the salt and water of our
existence.''
   In a speech Tuesday, Solis Palma denounced attempts to promote
``sanctions, pressure out of proportion (and) unjust recrimination
against a people who has honored its commitments .... We will
struggle without pause or truce for our survival.''
   Delvalle pointed to the deteriorating economic situation in his
unsuccessful attempt Feb. 25 to dismiss Noriega as chief of the
15,000-member Defense Forces of Panama, which include both the
military and police.
   ``The reasons that might take us to fiscal and economic
imbalance and that might push thousands of Panamanians to
unemployment, misery and despair cannot persist,'' Delvalle said in
announcing the general's dismissal.
   Noriega rallied his officer corps and loyalist politicians, and
the next day Delvalle had been replace and in hiding.
   The backbone of Panama's economy is formed by banks, insurance
companies, a large duty-free zone, the Panama Canal and
well-stocked retail and wholesale stores that attract buyers from
throughout Latin America.
   In New York, lawyers for Delvalle sued in federal court
Wednesday to block a bank from transferring an estimated $10
million to the Noriega regime. The lawyers later dropped the
lawsuit against Republic National Bank of New York after the bank
agreed to transfer the money to the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank.
   On Tuesday, Delvalle froze all Panamanian assets outside the
country. The United States, which still recognizes Delvalle as
president, supported the action. State Department spokewoman
Phyllis Oakley called it ``the legitimate action of the
constitutional government.''
   Panama's commercial bank debt is $2 billion and the total debt
for banks and government agencies is $5.5 billion, said a banking
source in the United States who spoke on condition of anonymity. He
said about $85 million in interest and principal is due to banks
and bond holders by March 31.
   The World Bank said Panama's total foreign debt was $4.8 billion
at the end of 1986, the latest year for which figures are
available. The debt, in a nation of 2.2 million people, is one of
the world's highest per capita.
   An ongoing general strike to protest Noriega's rule that began
Monday has had particular impact on construction and industrial
activity.
   Among the actions reported under consideration in the United
States is withholding payments from Panama Canal activities.
   The U.S. Commerce Department said Panama's gross income from the
canal in 1986 was $532 million. Revenue figures were not available
for last year, but the number of ships passing through the waterway
was said to be up slightly. evenue from the canal represents 10
percent of Panama's gross national product.

<HEAD>Bush Touts Ideas For Oil Industry and Agriculture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush says the
United States' flagging petroleum industry needs drilling
incentives rather than an oil import tax, while agriculture is
starting to rebound because of the Reagan administration's farm
policy.
   Talking with reporters after a rally at Louisiana State
University on Wednesday, Bush, a former oilman, said making changes
that will benefit the oil industry would enhance national security.
   ``The answer has to be national security and not economics. The
answer has got to be there is no security for this country with
increasing dependence on foreign oil. You can't make the case
simply on economics,'' he said.
   In addition to providing drilling incentives, Congress should
repeal the windfall profits tax, passed during the late 1970s when
the oil industry was deregulated, while petroleum prices are down
and do away with controls on natural gas, Bush said.
   ``I think if you take the case to the people in the fall for
this, I think it can get done,'' Bush said.
   The vice president was asked about suggestions by rival Bob Dole
that Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega was on the CIA
payroll during Bush's tenure as chief of the spy agency.
   ``He says he made all the decisions at the CIA,'' Dole said at a
news conference in New Orleans. ``What were they? Was Noriega on
the payroll when he was CIA director?''
   Dole, asked if he were accusing Bush of having knowledge of
Noriega's alleged drug trafficking, said: ``All I'm saying is that
Bob Dole said no to drugs, no to thugs, no to Noriega.''
   To that, Bush replied: ``I find it amazing that a United States
senator will talk about CIA matters. I took an oath of office to
protect sources and methods of intelligence and I would never
discuss anything I was doing at the CIA that would affect the
national security.
   ``There has just been one charge after another in this campaign
and I have just decided not to respond to Mr. Dole's charges.''
   On another matter, Bush said Reagan administration farm policy
was leading to a recovery in agriculture.
   ``The cattle people are doing much better now. Beef prices are
up. Hog prices are up. Don't fool with the farm bill,'' he said.
   Bush said he wanted to encourage foreign markets to buy more
American agricultural products, rather than enact protectionist
legislation.
   ``If we go the protection route, they'll go the protection
route,'' he said.
   In his speech before about 1,000 people, Bush said wins in
Louisiana and the other 19 states in next Tuesday's Super Tuesday
primary could translate into the Republican presidential nomination.
   ``If I do well in Louisiana and that's an indicator of doing
well in my home state of Texas and across to Florida, where I came
from this morning, I am absolutely convinced that I will be the
next president of the United States,'' Bush said.
   Rep. Richard Baker, who is serving as Bush's state campaign
chairman, told reporters that he was confident that the vice
president would win at least five of the state's eight
congressional districts.
   ``We will take a majority of the congressional districts and the
ones we take won't be close,'' he said.
   During Bush's speech, a group of about six protesters,
describing themselves as members of the Progressive Student
Network, raised a banner saying: ``Hey Bush, tell us about Contra
drug running.'' A man sporting a Bush campaign button reached up
and tore part of the banner down, drawing applause from other
supporters.
   The protesters also briefly chanted: ``Tell us about Contra
aid,'' also in reference to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   At the end of his speech, Bush pointed to one of the protesters
and said, ``Give that man a little jambalaya. He sounds starved to
death.''
   Bush then shed his suit coat and donned a white apron and served
jambalaya _ a spicy Cajun rice dish with sausage and chicken _ to
some of those in attendance.

<HEAD>Swaggart Far From Only Minister Addicted To Pornography, Group
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jimmy Swaggart will need more than counseling
and a three-month suspension from the ministry to overcome his
attraction to pornography, says a psychologist.
   ``No matter how much he prays to God, no matter how sincere, it
won't change him unless he seeks more extensive therapy,'' Victor
Cline said Wednesday at a gathering of the Religious Alliance
Against Pornography.
   Cline, a professor at the University of Utah, described an
effective treatment as one that treats pornography addicts in much
the same way as Alcoholics Anonymous treats alcoholics _ with a
24-hour-a-day support system.
   Swaggart last week confessed to unspecified sins. He reportedly
paid a prostitute to pose naked numerous times over a period of
about a year.
   Assemblies of God church officials in Louisiana have recommended
barring Swaggart from preaching for three months, but officials
asked for reconsideration after receiving hundreds of calls
protesting the penalty as too lenient.
   Allliance chairman Jerry Kirk estimated that between a dozen and
two dozen of the 5,000 or so ministers he has talked to in his
travels for the alliance are hooked on pornography.
   ``In my travels, I've had pastors confess to me their addiction,
and it truly is an addiction,'' alliance chairman Jerry Kirk said
at a news conference during a break in the seminar.
   About 400 members of the alliance gathered at a Washington hotel
for a seminar on how to battle pornography.
   The Religious Alliance Against Pornography was formed in July
1986 to battle child pornography and obscenity not protected by the
First Amendment to the Constitution.

   Irish rockers U2 led the new wave and a Brill
Building songwriting team represented the old guard with two awards
each at a surprising 30th Annual Grammy Awards, where Michael
Jackson was shut out and Paul Simon won again for ``Graceland.''
   ``We don't see this as a peak for U2,'' lead singer Bono said
Wednesday night after the socially conscious band copped its awards
for ``The Joshua Tree,'' its 12-million selling album. ``It's just
a beginning.''
   Simon, who won album of the year in 1987 for his South African
project ``Graceland,'' surprisingly captured record of the year
honors in 1988 for the title cut, which featured backing vocals by
the Everly Brothers.
   But Little Richard stole the show at Radio City Music Hall by
announcing, not once but three times, that he had captured the
Grammy for best new artist. Richard, in a gold suit and sunglasses,
finally broke down and declared one-time ``Soul Train'' dancer Jody
Watley the winner.
   ``I have never received nothing _ y'all never gave me no
Grammys, and I've been singing for years,'' the manic voice of
``Tutti-Frutti'' and ``Lucille'' proclaimed. ``I am the architect
of rock 'n' roll!''
   Veteran songwriting team Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, joined by
co-writer James Horner, won song of the year and best song written
for a motion picture or television with their syrupy ballad
``Somewhere Out There,'' a tune performed by two mice in the
animated movie ``An American Tail.''
   The pair is the last remaining songwriting team from the Brill
Building, the Manhattan offices where dozens of classic '60s songs
were written.
   ``I don't think there can be a best song,'' Weil told reporters.
``Every song is unique. I love the U2 song (`I Still Haven't Found
What I'm Looking For'), but it's apples and oranges.''
   After U2 won album of the year for ``Joshua,'' guitarist The
Edge gave a rambling acceptance speech in which he thanked Bishop
Desmond Tutu, Martin Luther King Jr., James T. Kirk, PeeWee Herman,
Jimi Hendrix, Dr. Ruth Westheimer ``and sumo wrestlers around the
world.''
   The band sat sipping beer in the audience during the three-hour
show, which featured an electrifying live performance by Jackson.
Jackson, who captured eight Grammys for his ``Thriller'' album in
1984, received no awards for its follow-up, ``Bad,'' despite four
nominations.
   The Los Angeles-based band Los Lobos, whose version of ``La
Bamba'' was a bigger hit than the original adaptation of the
Mexican folk tune by the late Ritchie Valens, came away with
nothing despite four nominations.
   And folk singer Suzanne Vega, with three nominations for her
poignant song ``Luka'' about a battered child, also went home
empty-handed.
   ``I was hoping it would win, but I was prepared for anything to
happen,'' said Vega, a Greenwich Village favorite. ``I'm a little
disappointed, I guess.''
   Bruce Springsteen won his second Grammy, best rock vocal
performance, for his ``Tunnel of Love'' album but was not around to
accept the award. The same was true of Simon and of Sting, who
topped Jackson and Springsteen for best pop vocal performance on
his ``Bring on the Night'' LP.
   Aretha Franklin, the Grammy-winningest woman of all time, added
two more to her 12 with best female R&B performance and best R&B
performance by a duo or group _ her ``I Knew You Were Waiting (For
Me)'' duet with George Michael.
   One of Aretha's protegees, Whitney Houston, took best female pop
vocalist for her effervescent single ``I Wanna Dance With
Somebody'' from her ``Whitney'' album. Narada Michael Walden won
the producer's Grammy for his work on Houston's second album.
   ``The world wants new faces in a way,'' said Walden, who beat
the Michael Jackson-Quincy Jones team. ``Quincy's won so many
awards anyway, this is good. And he told me in private that he
voted for me.''
   Jackson's ``Bad'' won just a single award: best engineered
non-classical album, with Bruce Swedien and Humberto Gatica
receiving the Grammys.
   The Grammys' two all-time leaders added to their impressive
totals. Sir Georg Solti, conductor of the Chicago Symphony, won his
26th Grammy, for his recording of Beethoven's 9th Symphony.
   And Pianist Vladimir Horowitz, who had 20 Grammys entering the
ceremonies, won two for best classical instrumental performance and
best classical album for ``Horowitz in Moscow.'' He also received
the President's Special Merit Award from the National Academy of
Recording Arts & Sciences, which sponsors the Grammys.
   ``I am so very happy the classical music still has an
appreciation,'' the fiery pianist told the crowd as he accepted the
special award. After he won the best album award, he simply smiled
and carried it away, saying nothing.
   Soprano Kathleen Battle, who starred on four of the five operas
nominated for Grammys, ended up winning two _ for the Vienna
Philharmonic recording of Richard Strauss' ``Ariadne auf Naxos''
and for her solo album, ``Salzburg Recital.''
   Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the South African vocal group featured
on the ``Graceland'' album, won a Grammy for best traditional folk
recording for ``Shaka Zulu.'' Simon produced it.
   ``First of all I thank God _ and then Paul Simon,'' said Joseph
Shabalala, lead singer of the 10-man group.
   Frank Zappa's ``Jazz from Hell'' beat his son, Dweezil, and
Springsteen for best rock instrumental _ Zappa's first-ever Grammy.
``Trio'' by Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt won as
best country vocal duo or group performance.
   The show, televised by CBS, saluted recordings released between
Oct. 1, 1986, and Sept. 30, 1987.
   The winners were elected by ballots cast by academy members in
seven chapters around the nation. The academy's 6,000 members
include recording artists, songwriters, musicians, producers and
technicians.

   The U.S. dollar topped the 129-yen barrier and kept
rising through the day, while stocks temporarily hit pre-crash
levels before closing lower today in what traders saw as a healthy
consolidation.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
25,596.31 points, down 86.51 points, or 0.34 percent, from
Wednesday's close after finishing the morning session at 25,755.95
points, higher than pre-crash levels.
   The dollar closed at 129.30 yen, up 0.83 yen from Wednesday's
close of 128.47 yen. The dollar opened the day at 129.05 yen,
breaking the 129-yen level for the first time since Feb. 23.
   Before the October crash, the Nikkei index stood at 25,746.56
points.
   ``Basically we saw a bit of a fall off in early morning
trading,'' said Paul Warren of Salomon Brothers. ``But the final
decline shows a healthy consolidation that will help the market in
the future. We were seeing a change in rotational theme, into
electronics and utilities.''
   Warren said he expects the market to return to its all-time
highs and possibly go even higher in the next two to three months.
   ``Personally, I think that the dollar will continue to rise,''
said a foreign exchange dealer, who demanded anonymity.
   A currency dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo, who spoke
on condition his name not be used, said the dollar's strength was
attributed to a Japanese news report that a senior U.S. government
official in charge of monetary and credit policy had suggested the
United States was willing to accommodate a substantial rise in the
dollar.
   According to the report, carried in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun,
the unidentified official said the United States was preparing a
reference range and indicated that the allowable upper limit could
be as high as 160 yen.

   A former mental patient opened fire
with two six-shooters near the Alamo, shooting four people at
random and trading shots with police before he was wounded and
taken into custody, authorities said.
   Marvin Duncan, 55, shot in the left thigh by police, was charged
with six counts of attempted capital murder, police spokesman Sgt.
Paul Buske said. Bond was set at $1.5 million.
   The most seriously wounded victim, Deborah Reyes, 29, was shot
in the chest and stomach and was in critical condition at Brooke
Army Medical Center late Wednesday, said hospital spokesman Sgt.
William Banks.
   The three others, shot at point-blank range, were not injured
seriously, officials said.
   Witnesses said the shooting, which took place in the week that
marks the 152nd anniversary of the fall of the mission to Mexican
troops, resembled something from a movie.
   ``All hell broke loose,'' said Todd Tarble, 20, who was waiting
for a bus about three blocks from the Alamo when the shooting began.
   ``He had two guns in his hands. I've never seen anything like
that. The guy was acting like John Wayne. This guy was crazy,''
Tarble said.
   Duncan was listed in good condition at Medical Center Hospital.
   Court records show Duncan was placed in Rusk State Hospital for
the mentally or criminally insane in October 1980 after being found
incompetent to stand trial on an attempted murder charge.
   He was released in March 1981 to stand trial, but Bexar County
prosecutors dismissed the charge in favor of a civil commitment to
San Antonio State Hospital. The records did not indicate Duncan's
status at the state hospital.
   Duncan took a taxicab downtown about 9 a.m. Wednesday, and about
three blocks from the Alamo he pulled out two .357-caliber Magnum
revolvers and began shooting from inside the cab, got out and
continued firing, authorities said.
   Taxi driver Frank Esquivel, 42, jumped from the cab when the
shooting started. He said the man said nothing during the four-mile
ride. ``I have no idea what set him off,'' he said.
   Homicide Lt. Albert Ortiz said the gunman was methodical in his
shooting.
   ``From the time he was picked up at his residence, throughout
the shooting he remained calm and his actions were deliberate, not
hurried,'' Ortiz said.
   Duncan has been arrested numerous times since 1973 on charges
including assaults and an attempted murder charge, said Police
Chief William O. Gibson.
   ``As to why the suspect began shooting, we don't know why, with
the exception that he wanted to gain some attention,'' Gibson said.
   As passers-by dived for cover, officer Donald Kawazoe, on his
way to work, saw the man and ordered him to stop.
   The two traded shots and the gunman fled and confronted Park
Ranger Bennie Burley. They also exchanged gunfire before the gunman
was arrested, Gibson said, but could not say which officer shot
Duncan.

<HEAD>Jackson Prepares For Super Tuesday With Eight-State Television
Campaign</HEAD>

   Jesse Jackson will begin $100,000 worth
of TV ads in the crucial campaign days before Super Tuesday and has
borrowed $410,000 to keep his campaign going until after that
contest, his campaign manager says.
   The TV buy, the largest to date for Jackson's cash-poor
campaign, will target Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia, said campaign
manager Gerald Austin.
   The ads start Friday.
   Austin said the loan, for expenses other than the ads in those
eight Super Tuesday states, was borrowed from Adams Bank in
Washington two weeks ago and will be paid back March 18.
   Austin made the comments aboard Jackson's plane as it
hopscotched across five southern states Wednesday.
   In his bid to woo Southern whites and build on the white support
he has won this year in Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire and
Vermont, Jackson picked up the endorsement Wednesday of Jim
Hightower, the popular agriculture commissioner of Texas.
   Jackson was welcomed to Selma, Ala., by the white mayor who had
Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights activists arrested
more than three decades ago.
   Austin said Jackson's success on Super Tuesday depends on
getting out the black vote, attaining close to 10 percent of the
white vote and the unknown potential of GOP candidate Pat
Robertson, the former TV evangelist, to pull Demoratic voters into
the Republican primaries.
   The campign will spend about $350,000 on the Super Tuesday
contests, Austin said, which is far less than the $3 million-plus
some Democratic competitors are expected to shell out.
   Austin would not say how many of the 1,307 Super Tuesday
delegates he thinks Jackson can get, but said the goal is to win
more than the 222 Jackson won in his 1984 race in those states.
   In Selma, Jackson received the key to the city from Mayor Joe
Smitherman, who was mayor in 1965 when state troopers forcefully
stopped civil rights marchers from crossing the Alabama River
bridge that Jackson's motorcade drove across on Wednesday.
   ``I had Dr. King arrested,'' Smitherman said. ``The Voting
Rights Act was right. We were wrong. We've admitted that.''
   Jackson called Smitherman's reception a sign of the ``New
South.''
   ``People grow,'' he said. ``We have a new challenge now. He
fought it in '65 and he lost. Now we have a common battle.''
   In the Texas state capitol, Hightower said Jackson speaks to
``an ignored majority of Americans whose lives have been frustrated
or flattened by the economic policies of recent years.''
   Jackson is appealing to whites with a message of ``economic
common ground'' that binds the underprivileged of all races.
   Jackson's message includes calls for a higher minimum wage,
comparable worth pay for women, child care and housing programs.
   He often mentions the plight of hard-hit textile workers, saying
he ``reluctantly'' supports congressional legislation to limit
textile imports because of the ``dire emergency'' of the South's
once-thriving industry.
   He encounters mixed reactions from whites.
   He began Wednesday in his home state of South Carolina, arriving
just after dawn with a troop of reporters in tow, for a breakfast
of grits, biscuits and eggs at Tom Trantham's dairy farm.
   Trantham and three white neighbors talked farm policy with the
presidential contender and told reporters how Jackson supported
them during the 1986 drought and helped unload hay brought in from
other states.
   But when asked if they supported him for president, they were
noncommital.
   ``I'm not supporting anybody at this point,'' said Michael Sly,
a farmer organizer.

<HEAD>Gephardt Says He'd Consider Carter, Ford as Envoys to the Middle
East</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt says he would consider
former presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford to serve as special
envoys to the Middle East if he is elected president.
   In a meeting with St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial writers,
while on a swing through his home state Wednesday, Gephardt said he
had discussed the idea with Carter on Tuesday when he stopped in
Plains, Ga.
   ``We talked about it,'' Gephardt said. ``He said he was ready,
willing and able to do anything asked by a future president.''
   Elsewhere, Gephardt's home-turf message was concentrated on the
country's foreign trade policy. He told the St. Louis Board of
Aldermen that he would seek policies that reduce the trade deficit
by enabling U.S. businesses to compete fairly in world markets.
   ``How do you tell people who are out of work that the trade
deficit is a fact of life?'' Gephardt asked. ``I don't accept the
deficit and I don't think you do either. We have the power to make
the nation better than it was before. This is your fight too.''
   Gephardt, called for new policies that ``ask trading partners to
treat us as fairly as we treat them.''
   Without getting specific, Gephardt said it was time for the
government to enact trade policies that ``take the heat of unfair
foreign competition off those who farm our land, forge our steel
and build our cars.''
   Gephardt said he did not agree with a statement by President
Reagan that the trade deficit is a ``sign of strength.'' Nor, he
said, did he agree with the attitude that the trade deficit ``is a
fact of life.''
   Gephardt also touched on agricultural issues in his speech.
   ``The agriculture program doesn't make sense,'' he said. ``Isn't
it time we had an agriculture program in this country that let the
farmers vote and let the farmers decide what we're going to do?''
   Gephardt began a two-day swing through his home state Wednesday
for a series of speeches and four fundraisers six days before
Missouri's ``Super Tuesday'' primary.
   Saying ``My, how good it is to be home,'' Gephardt brought his
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination to the place
where he got his start in politics.
   After the address in the St. Louis City Hall chambers where he
began his political career, Gephardt traveled to Springfield for a
campaign fundraising reception. He returned to St. Louis for a
fundraiser Wednesday night before flying to Kansas City.
   Gephardt arrived in Springfield the day after the Springfield
News-Leader endorsed Sen. Paul Simon in the race for the Democratic
nomination.
   Gephardt, who was a St. Louis alderman from 1971 to 1976, used
the economic rebirth of the city during those years as an example
for his promise to return economic prosperity to those who work in
the nation's factories, farms and steel mills.
   ``I began my career right here in this room when this was a city
with many difficulties and troubles,'' Gephardt said. ``A lot of
people were giving up on St. Louis. They said the future was
elsewhere. But we didn't believe that. We did what needed to be
done to make St. Louis a success story.''
   Sam Hamra, a Springfield attorney and finance chairman for the
Gephardt campaign in Missouri, said $25,000 was raised at the
event. During the day $425,000 was raised, bringing the
campaign-long total in Missouri to nearly $2 million, said S. Lee
Kling, Gephardt's campaign treasurer.

   A 71-year-old retired coal miner who
revived after being twice declared dead says he returned to life
with a profound spiritual renewal.
   ``I think that it's from a spiritual standpoint that (my life)
has changed,'' Shirley Barnett, who is also a retired Baptist
minister, said Wednesday.
   ``When I came to ... I had nothing but a heart full of love and
joy for everybody. I was refreshed in the Holy Ghost.''
   Barnett, who revived while his funeral arrangements were being
made, was declared dead on Jan. 21 after a cardiac arrest. Doctors
said he showed no vital signs for about 45 minutes during one
episode and about 30 minutes during a second.
   The slender, smiling man spoke to reporters from his wheelchair
during a news conference at HCA Park West Medical Centers. Two of
his doctors, who were at a loss to explain his revival, also were
on hand to answer questions.
   ``I feel fine. A little weak, naturally,'' he said.
   ``The first thing I remember was my daughter telling me I was at
Park West,'' he said. ``She put it pretty bluntly that I had died.''
   On Jan. 16, Barnett was admitted to Methodist Medical Center in
nearby Oak Ridge after suffering chest pains.
   A heart artery constricted five days later, and doctors and
nurses spent 45 minutes trying to revive him with an external
pacemaker and electric shock, but he showed no pulse, blood
pressure or neurological responses, said Dr. Victor McLaughlin, a
cardiologist at the Oak Ridge hospital.
   Weak, sporadic heartbeats were detected thereafter but were
considered ``a dying heart pattern,'' the physician said.
   ``It is very unlikely that if you can bring someone back (from
that status) you'll have any functioning brain at all,'' McLaughlin
said.
   McLaughlin said he told Barnett's family members that the man
had died, and he was disconnected from his intravenous feeding
tubes and heart monitor.
   Barnett's daughters signed papers to remove the body to the
morgue and began calling family and friends to tell them of his
death and to make funeral arrangements.
   A nurse who began cleaning out Barnett's hospital room closet
heard him start to breathe, McLaughlin said, and he was wheeled to
the coronary care unit.
   There, personnel again found no pulse or blood pressure. Barnett
was hooked up to a pacemaker and respirator, but family members
told doctors he had a ``living will'' requesting that he not be
kept alive artificially.
   That period of apparent death lasted about 30 minutes,
McLaughlin said.
   Doctors disconnected Barnett from the life-sustaining equipment,
but once unhooked, he began breathing on his own again.
   ``The gentleman gradually began waking up ... and talked with
us. He continued to do well on his own,'' said McLaughlin. ``There
is no detectable short- or long-term memory loss in this man.
   ``I've never had an experience like this before,'' he said.
``There are obviously things that happen that we cannot explain.''
   Barnett later underwent heart bypass surgery.
   Dr. Gene Aaby, another of Barnett's doctors, has said a possible
reason for the revival could stem from Barnett's black-lung
condition, an occupational respiratory disease of miners.
   ``We came up with the theory that perhaps his brain had gotten
used to less oxygen. We know various cells can adapt and function''
in adverse situations, he said.

<HEAD>New Polio Vaccine Strategy May Also Lead to Hepatitis Vaccine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists reported today they had created a
polio virus that may lead to a safer polio vaccine and an
immunization for hepatitis A.
   When the virus was given to animals as a vaccine, it made their
immune systems raise defenses against two different types of
natural polio virus, the scientists reported in the British journal
Nature.
   The standard oral polio vaccine uses three types of live but
weakened polio viruses. It stimulates the immune system to create
proteins, called antibodies, to attack each type.
   The vaccine is considered safe. But in rare cases it can produce
polio, which is blamed on its ``type 2'' and ``type 3'' virus
strains, the British researchers wrote.
   An average of eight such cases occur annually in the United
States, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   The study suggests a potential way to construct a vaccine
without using standard type 2 or type 3 virus.
   The researchers genetically modified type 1 virus so that it
carried a protein characteristic of the type 3 virus.
   Mice and rabbits immunized with it produced antibodies against
both types, the scientists said. In addition, a monkey fed the
man-made virus also produced antibodies against each type, they
reported.
   In an accompanying editorial, James Hogle of the Research
Institute of Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, Calif., wrote that similar
work has been done in a collaboration between scientists at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook and in Japan, and by a
second team at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.
   Samuel Katz, chairman of the pediatrics department at Duke
University Medical Center, said in an interview that more work is
needed to see if the British work will lead to a new human vaccine.
But ``it sounds extremely promising (for making) an extraodinarily
good vaccine even better,'' he said.
   Hogle wrote that as a practical matter, the current vaccine is
so safe and effective that a new version may be hard to test in the
population.
   Hogle and Katz also said the research approach may help in
creating a vaccine for hepatitis A, which is caused by a virus
similar to the polio virus.
   The idea would be to make a type 1 polio virus carry parts of
the hepatitis A virus, to spur the immune system into making
antibodies against the hepatitis virus, Katz said.
   In addition, Katz said, the strategy might be applicable for
vaccines against echoviruses and Coxsackievirus, which cause
serious diseases such as meningitis and heart inflammation.

<HEAD>Kennedy, Panetta Introduce Anti-Hunger Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Democratic proposal by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy would pump an extra $266 million into food stamps and other
government emergency food programs.
   ``We could obviously do more, but we cannot afford to do less,''
Kennedy said Wednesday in introducing the measure.
   The Massachusetts Democrat, chairman of the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, said the bill would increase funding for
federal programs for food stamps, school breakfasts, child care
food and summer food service.
   Kennedy said domestic hunger had been largely eradicated by the
late 1970s, but that the recession of the early 1980s, coupled with
sharp cuts in social programs under the Reagan administration, has
brought it back at record levels.
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said the question of hunger is ``a
moral issue'' and ``a test of America's conscience.''
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., introduced companion legislation in
the House.

<HEAD>Bank Profits in 1987 Lowest Since Depression</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks recorded their least profitable year
since the Great Depression in 1987, but a top federal regulator
says he's hopeful about the future.
   The nation's federally insured commercial banks earned $3.7
billion last year on assets of $3 trillion, down from $17.5 billion
earnings in 1986, said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.
   That amounted to a return on assets of only 0.13 percent last
year and was the lowest level since the FDIC, which insures
deposits of up to $100,000, was established in 1934.
   The year-to-year drop in earnings was due entirely to large
banks adding to reserves to cover anticipated losses on loans to
Third World countries, Seidman said. Nine of the 10 largest banks
and 17 of the 25 largest reported a loss for 1987.
   ``Absent the extraordinary reserving for (developing country)
loans ... net income would have been roughly equal to 1986's
level,'' Seidman said Wednesday in the FDIC's bank profile for the
fourth quarter of 1987.
   Seidman said he believed there was a good chance that banks
could avoid further large additions to reserves for bad Third World
loans and said, ``The outlook for 1988 is cautiously optimistic.''

<HEAD>Army Stops Random Drug Testing of Civilians, But Seeks Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army says it has stopped random drug
testing for civilian workers to comply with a court ruling, but was
asking the Justice Department to appeal the judgment.
   The service, in a brief statement, said Wednesday it would limit
its civilian drug testing for the time being to those instances in
which ``there is a reasonable suspicion that a specific employee is
under the influence of drugs while on duty.''
   ``The Army has asked the Department of Justice to appeal the
ruling,'' the service said in its statement. ``The Army has also
requested that Justice ask for a stay of the judge's order during
the appeal process.''
   Testing on a random basis, however, has been halted for now, the
service added.
   The move follows a decision in U.S. District Court in Washington
on Tuesday in which a judge ruled that random drug testing amounted
to an unreasonable search prohibited by the Constitution.

<HEAD>US Denounces Plan to Ban Foreign Financing of Political Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department has denounced a South
African government proposal to block foreign financing of political
groups and individuals, perhaps including those receiving $25
million from the U.S. government.
   ``We regard this legislation as unwarranted,'' said spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley on Wednesday.
   ``Coming on the heels of last week's effective outlawing of most
anti-apartheid organizations, this is further evidence that the
South African government, not content with being isolated by others
from the rest of the world, is determined to isolate itself from
Western democracies and the world abroad.''
   Tuesday's proposal, apparently aimed at more groups than 17
anti-apartheid organizations hit by the government last week, would
restrict groups found to receive foreign money.
   In the current fiscal year, the United States has allocated $25
million to fund scholarships for South African blacks in their
country and in the United States, to help develop businesses owned
by black, for community help projects and labor union training,
Mrs. Oakley said.

<HEAD>Mother Is Told Remains of Vietnam Vet Son Have Not Been Returned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military called it an administrative error,
but an elderly woman who flew here from the East to claim her son's
remains says news that they haven't been returned from Vietnam
means her 22-year nightmare continues.
   Malfada DiTommaso, accompanied by her daughter Virginia
Contanelli and a television news crew, arrived Wednesday from
Buffalo, N.Y., after being told her son's remains had been
repatriated from Vietnam.
   But upon arrival at Honolulu International Airport, the military
officials who greeted her said there had been a mistake: her son's
military identification card had been returned, but not his remains.
   ``This really boggles my mind,'' Mrs. DiTommaso, 75, said. ``The
Air Force blames Hanoi, but I don't see how a mistake like this
could happen.
   ``I wasn't coming here expecting a happy ending, but I was
expecting my son to finally be home. This is almost too much to
handle.''
   Maj. Robert J. DiTommaso was 24 when he and seven fellow
crewmembers were shot down on July 29, 1966, over North Vietnam
near the Laos border. He was declared missing in action for 12
years before being classified as ``killed in action, body not
found'' in 1978. The Defense Department said there are still 2,404
Americans listed missing in Indochina, 13 years after the United
States pulled out.
   For the past 22 years, Mrs. DiTommaso said, she has been
searching for information about her son. She has traveled to Laos,
obtained information through the Freedom of Information Act and
joined veterans groups.
   ``I'm in limbo. It's a nightmare only a mother could
understand,'' she said.
   ``It's been a day to day trauma for my mother,'' her daughter
added. ``She's changed from a quiet little housewife to one who's
fighting for her son.''
   A thaw in U.S.-Vietnamese relations brought new hope, and Mrs.
DiTommaso said she was relieved when she got a call from the
Casualty Division of Randolph Air Force Base in Texas that her
son's remains were to be returned by Hanoi.
   The Pentagon announced last week that the remains of 20 American
serviceman killed during the Vietnam War were to be repatriated,
but that before they were released to the next of kin they would be
brought to the Army's Central Identification Laboratory here for
positive identification.
   ``What happened is that Hanoi sent only 17 remains plus
information on three others,'' said Maj. Virginia Pribyla, media
officer for the U.S. Pacific Command. ``They also had a list of 10
name associations, which just means the Vietnamese think they know
who they (the remains) are, but they're not positive.''
   DiTommaso was mentioned on that list, Pribyla said, and that
information was forwarded to his family, but Mrs. DiTommaso was
clearly told that no positive identification had been completed.
   ``We forward all the information we get, but we certainly don't
encourage families to come out here unless identification is
absolute,'' Pribyla said. ``But Mrs. DiTommaso came out when she
first got word, unfortunately it was just premature.''
   ``It was an administrative error. Unfortunately, the information
Hanoi forwarded to us turned out not to be right,'' she said.
``That's why we wait until getting positive identification from the
lab here before officially releasing the names.''
   Mrs. DiTommaso said she was especially shocked by the news
because a news crew had traveled with her to film her receiving her
son's remains.
   Her trip was paid for by United Airlines and Buffalo's ABC
affliate, KBW-TV.
   ``This isn't the story we were hoping to get, but we'll just
wait a while and see what Mrs. DiTommaso wants to do now. I can't
believe it ended up this way,'' said reporter Dan Hausley, who
accompanied her.
   Mrs. DiTommaso said she would attend a memorial ceremony today
at Hickam Air Force Base when the remains are flown in.
   ``They're still our boys, and I know how their families must
feel,'' she said.
   She said she still holds hope her son is alive, and that someday
they will be reunited.
   ``This is terrible because it leaves me in limbo, but it also
leaves me with hope,'' she said. ``I know there must be Americans
in there that are still alive, maybe Bobby is one of them.''

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush brought out a
campaign weapon as he made a swing through this crucial Super
Tuesday state _ former Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater.
   Supporters at Miami International Airport clapped and cheered as
Goldwater picked his way slowly down the ramp of Air Force Two.
Goldwater campaigned with Bush throughout South Florida and in
Tampa as Bush began a five-state Southern swing.
   The former Arizona senator, a hero to conservatives, campaigned
for Bush last month in the final days before the New Hampshire
primary, which the vice president won handily.
   Tanned and appearing healthy, although walking with a cane,
Goldwater praised Bush's experience and dedication during brief
remarks at campaign stops. Bush said he had discussed issues and
gotten advice from Goldwater during the flight from Washington to
Florida.
   With Bush considered strong in most of the South, delegate-rich
Florida has been targeted by his rivals, and Bush is fighting to
keep them from making inroads.
   ``Barry Goldwater is the grand old man of the Republican Party,
the true statesman for American conservatives,'' said Ken Wright,
Bush's Florida campaign director.
   Wright said he believed Goldwater's help could be important in
luring some of the Florida conservatives who have been leaning
toward Pat Robertson, who has shown strong organization in some
parts of the state.
   Wright also pointed to Florida's large share of senior citizens.
   ``Many of these people probably voted for Barry Goldwater,''
Wright said, referring to Goldwater's 1964 GOP presidential bid.
   Wright said Goldwater's visit shows the former senator's
commitment to Bush.
   ``I think he (Goldwater) did it out of long friendship and
belief that the vice president can carry on the conservative
ideals,'' Wright said. ``It's not like you have somebody who's
working for you because he wants something in return. It's not like
he wants to be secretary of defense.''
   Bush campaign officials weren't sure whether Goldwater would do
any more campaigning in the South.

   A couple say they feel foolish that they
bought two new cars and planned to quit their jobs after concluding
they had won a $2 million in a mail-order company sweepstakes.
   Kathy and Dale Work said they still hope that they have won the
money from United States Purchasing Exchange of Los Angeles.
   ``I know they claim we haven't won anything, but I still have
faith in that company, that they're going to come across for us,''
Mrs. Work, of suburban Stoney Ridge, said Wednesday.
   ``I guess it seems like we're a couple of country hicks,'' she
said. ``We went out and bought a new pickup truck and a new car.
We'd made all kinds of plans. I don't know what we're going to do
now.''
   David Carlin of Loeb & Loeb, a New York law firm representing
USPE, said the company thinks someone is sending out fake contest
information to USPE contestants, and that it was unlikely the Works
would get any money.
   The U.S. Postal Service said it has received complaints about
the company and forwarded them to the Federal Trade Commission for
investigation.
   A man who answered USPE's telephone said the sweepstakes is
still running and Mrs. Work is one of thousands who won a chance at
the $2 million-plus top prize. He would not give his name and would
not answer other questions.
   Mrs. Work is not the first to be confused by the sweepstakes.
Debra Long of Pearl City, Mich., told reporters she recently quit
her job and vacationed in Las Vegas, Nev., before learning she had
not won $1.7 million, as she thought.
   Michael Flitcraft, a truck driver from Chardon, said he thought
he had won the contest after receiving a certified letter from the
company on Monday.
   Carlin said Miss Long apparently was the victims of a hoax. He
said she reported receiving a certified notification letter from
USPE and confirmed her winnings with a telephone call to USPE on
Feb. 15, Presidents' Day.
   ``The company does not notify winners by certified mail, the
company's offices were closed on Presidents' Day, the company does
not request bank account numbers from winners nor does it require
the other information Miss Long claims was requested of her,'' he
said.
   Carlin said the company referred the matter involving Miss Long
to the FBI.
   Dee Ellison of the Washington, D.C., office of the Federal Trade
Commission declined comment on whether the agency is investigating
the company, but she said the FTC has received complaints about the
company.
   Mrs. Work said she received a letter from the company in October
that read: ``We are pleased to inform you that you have been
designated to receive certified bank checks from the United States
Purchasing Exchange for $1,894,876 ... your winnings in our
multimillion dollar sweepstakes when you are the grand prize
winner.''
   A few weeks later, Mrs. Work got another letter saying that her
winnings stood at $2,024,464. Then she received what she thought
were two checks, one for $2 million and one for $24,000.
   She was asked to endorse them and send them back to the company
along with her Social Security and bank account numbers. At that
point, the Works thought they were millionaires.
   However, the mailing said, ``Certified bank check for this
amount ... will be drawn and issued to Kathy Work upon verification
that the Kathy Work entry has been selected by the independent
judging organization as the prize-winner in accordance to the rules
and regulations set forth and established.''
   Carlin said the sweepstakes does not close until Dec. 31.
   Mrs. Work said she'd planned to close the beauty salon she runs
out of her home and her husband considered quitting his job when
they thought they had won. Work works at Manville Corp. in
Waterville, about 15 miles southwest of Toledo.

   Share prices rose in early London trading today as
investors continued buying leading stocks.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index was up 16.60 points
at 1,825.3 at 10 a.m.
   When the market officially opened at 9 a.m., the index was up
12.8 points at 1,821.5.
   Dealers said they saw a repeat of Wednesday's buying interest in
early trading.
   The buying helped reinforce hopes that the FT-SE 100 index will
consolidate above the 1,800 point level in the run up to Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's March 15 budget statement.
   On Wednesday the FT-SE 100 broke through the barrier for the
first time since Jan. 18 to close up 26.8 points at 1808.7.
   The early rise in London today followed small gains in New York
Wednesday, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.83 to
2,071.29, and a fall in Tokyo overnight, where the Nikkei index
fell 86.51 to 25,596.31.

   The long night of a 7-year-old Turkish girl born
with no external eyes may be ending, says the surgeon who
reconstructed her right eyelid and is optimistic that she soon may
be able to see shapes.
   Dilek Erdogan was born with a nose and a mouth, ``and that's it
for her face,'' said Dr. Allen Putterman, who performed the surgery
Wednesday at the University of Illinois Hospital.
   ``The first thing she said when she awoke from surgery was
`thank you,''' said Ismet Deletioglu, a North Side restaurateur who
brought the girl and her mother to Chicago a year ago after reading
about Dilek's condition in a newspaper from her homeland.
   Dilek, of Istanbul, suffers from a rare condition callyed
cryptophthalmos, or hidden eye, said Putterman, who specializes in
oculoplastic surgery.
   In August, Putterman slit open the skin over her right eye and
placed an insert between the skin and the eye to create space
around the eyeball. He then sewed the slit closed.
   On Wednesday, Putterman said, he opened the slit and formed an
eyelid for that eye, and placed the insert in Dilek's left eye.
   Deletioglu said Dilek understands what is happening to her.
``She woke up at 3 a.m. ... before her surgery and was too excited
to fall back to sleep,'' he said.
   In two weeks, she should be ready to receive a cornea transplant
for her scarred right eye, Putterman said. The muscles and retina
for that eye are normal, he said.
   ``Our hope is not for her to read but to see forms and get
around,'' he said.
   ``I feel that we have an excellent chance of making her look
close to normal,'' said Putterman.
   After Wednesday's surgery, Dilek responded to a flashlight
shining toward her eye by averting her head, Putterman said. ``Her
response to that light was more vivid than it had been before,'' he
said.
   Dilek's eye is still covered by a thin tissue that will be
removed when she has the cornea graft, but the shape of her eyeball
is visible for the first time in her life, Putterman said.
   ``I saw her eye for the first time. I have never been happier in
my life,'' Deletioglu said Wednesday night.
   ``Her mother just said, `Thank God, and thank this country.' She
is in shock,'' Deletioglu said. Neither Dilek nor her mother,
Guidane, speak English.
   In six months, Putterman will finish the plastic surgery on her
left eye, and an artificial eye will be inserted to make her look
like a normal child, he said.
   ``Socially and psychologically it should be a big step,''
Putterman said.
   Putterman and Dr. Joel Sugar, who will perform the corneal
graft, have donated their services. Deletioglu has raised the rest
of the money to pay for her hospital expenses.
   Deletioglu said he has raised about $14,000 in contributions to
pay for her medical expenses.
   The expenses from both surgeries already performed will be about
$9,500, said Michael Maggio, a hospital spokesman.

<HEAD>Many Don't Want To Know If They Will Get Fatal Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A new test can reveal who will get the lethal,
inherited Huntington's disease, but doctors have found no rush of
people wanting to learn their fate.
   Doctors from the New England Huntington's Disease Research
Center described their experience with the first 16 months of a
testing program in a report in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The newly available test can reveal which people with the
illness in their families are likely to carry the Huntington's
disease gene themselves. Such people face a 50-50 risk of getting
the disease, often when they reach their 30s or 40s.
   The doctors, who began offering the test in 1986, said 250
people at risk of the disease inquired about the test. However,
fewer than 20 percent came in for an initial appointment. The
doctors eventually studied 47 people, but 19 of them withdrew
before their test results were known.
   ``The relatively low number of participants may indicate that
once something is actually available, people become more
cautious,'' said Dr. Joseph B. Martin of Massachusetts General
Hospital. ``It takes a fairly introspective person to decide to
know the results.''
   Of those who went through with the testing, four people were
found to probable carriers of the Huntington's genes, while seven
others were shown to be free of it.
   In five people, the test could not provide a definitive answer.
Seven people are awaiting for test results. The doctors were able
to diagnose five other people as having early signs of the disease
without needing the genetic test.
   ``Our main concern has been the impact that the test results
have on each person's life now and in the future,'' said Dr.
Richard H. Myers of Boston University Medical School, the program's
research coordinator.
   The people who were found to carry the Huntington's gene were
shocked and surprised by the news.
   ``All indicated that although they were aware that their test
could be positive, they did not actually expect such a result,''
the researchers wrote.
   These people suffered moderate to severe bouts of depression,
which eased over the following year.
   The New England screening center is operated by Boston
University Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital and
McLean Hospital. The screening test also is offered at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver.
   Huntington's disease destroys brain cells. Victims are afflicted
by uncontrollable movements. Eventually they lose their memory as
well as their ability to walk, talk and swallow.

<HEAD>Parachutists Help NASA Test Escape System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Navy parachutists slid
down a 12-foot pole and floated 7,500 feet to the ground in what
NASA said was another successful test of an alternate escape system
for space shuttle crew members.
   ``In the opinion of both the jumpers and the astronuats who
observed the test, the test was highly successful,'' NASA spokesman
Ralph Jackson said Wednesday after returning from a remote viewing
site in this Mojave Desert base 70 miles north of Los Angeles.
   The escape system uses a telescoping pole that would extend down
and to the rear of the shuttle. Astronauts would attach themselves
to rings on the pole, slide clear of the shuttle and then parachute.
   During the test, the parachutists slid down a pole protruding
from a C-141 plane 7,500 feet above the desert and then deployed
their chutes, Jackson said. ``The dynamics of coming off the pole
and getting away from the aircraft look pretty good,'' although it
will be a week before NASA knows if the test showed that escaping
astronauts would stay clear of the shuttle wing, said astronaut
Steve Nagle, who was aboard the plane.
   Jackson said the test also was watched by astronauts Carl Meade
and George ``Pinky'' Nelson, who is scheduled to fly on the
Discovery when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
resumes shuttle flights this summer.
   It was the 10th test of the pole escape system, but was
conducted at a faster air speed, 200 knots, than previous tests,
Jackson said.
   Another escape system, tested successfully with dummies in
November at California's China Lake Naval Weapons Center, would
require astronauts, one at a time, to hook onto small tractor
rockets stored in the shuttle cabin. The astronauts would be pulled
clear of the shuttle, then parachute to the ocean.
   NASA officials say they will decide in April between the two
systems for use on the Discovery, which is scheduled to fly Aug. 4,
more than 2{ years after the post-liftoff explosion of Challenger
on Jan. 28, 1986, killed seven crew members and halted U.S. manned
space flights.
   An escape system would be effective only if a shuttle was flying
level under controlled conditions at an altitude of less than
20,000 feet _ for example, if it had to ditch in the ocean _ not
when shuttle booster rockets are firing, as was the case during the
Challenger accident.
   Nelson said an escape system that worked under all conditions
was not possible with the shuttle.
   ``There's a balance you have to make between flying and staying
on the ground and fixing everything,'' said Nelson, who rode the
Columbia in the last pre-Challenger shuttle flight.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was little changed against most
major currencies in moderate European trading early today. Gold
prices fell.
   Dealers said they expected the dollar would trade within a
narrow range before the March 17 release of the latest U.S.
merchandise trade figures.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 129.30 yen from 128.47
yen. Later, in London, it eased to 129.27 yen. A Tokyo dealer said
the dollar rallied after a news report said a senior U.S.
government official had suggested the Reagan administration was
willing to allow a substantial rise in the U.S. currency.
   In London, the British pound edged down to 1.7677 from 1.7680
late Wednesday.
   Other rates at mid-morning, compared with rates late Wednesday:
   --1.6955 West German marks, up from 1.6945
   --1.4025 Swiss francs, up from 1.4005
   --5.7365 French francs, up from 5.7345
   --1.9026 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9013
   --1,248.90 Italian lire, up from 1,247.00
   --1.2555 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2558
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $429.70 a troy ounce, up
from $429.50 late Wednesday, but fell back slightly at mid-morning
today, when the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $429.15.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $428.50, down from $429.50 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell to a closing bid of $433.96,
down from $434.95 bid late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a bid price of $6.21 a troy
ounce, down from $6.24 bid late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Mass. House Passes Universal Health Care Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' first-in-the-nation
proposal to provide health insurance to all Massachusetts residents
won House approval and was sent back to the state Senate, which
passed a similar bill last session.
   The House approved the $1 billion measure late Wednesday night
by a 100-53 vote after three days of debate, with opposition
focusing on the plan's potential cost.
   House Minority Leader Steven Pierce, a Republican, said the bill
``reminds me of the old, hopefully gone, consumer ripoff when
people door-to-door sold home improvements.''
   ``They said sign on the dotted line and if you have any problems
I'll take care of them,'' he said. ``Everything wasn't all right,
but once the consumer realized the problems, it was too late.''
   ``I think in the end we are going to have a good bill,'' said
Senate Ways and Means Chairman Patricia McGovern, a Democrat and
the key proponent in the Senate. ``The thing that pleases me is
that we begin the process probably very much in agreement.''
   A bill adopted by the Senate late in the 1987 session served as
the outline for the House proposal.
   Dukakis was informed of the House vote late Wednesday while
campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in Texas.
   ``The Massachusetts House has committed itself to health
security for every man, woman and child in the Commonwealth and I
congratulate (the leadership) and all the members on this historic
action,'' Dukakis said in statement.
   The governor said he hoped the Senate would move expeditiously
on the bill. ``I continue to hope the work can be completed in
mid-March,'' he said.
   While the bill outlines a four-year plan for phasing in
universal health care coverage in Massachusetts, it wasn't until
Wednesday that lawmakers committed themselves to a specific state
financing level beyond the bill's $125 million first-year cost.
   The price tag they set as the maximum the state would pay for
three years, when added to the lowest estimate for the remaining
year, would put the tab for health care for all in Massachusetts at
$1.1 billion.
   The measure would make health insurance available to all
residents, notably the estimated 600,000 now uninsured, by 1992.
   Employers who did not provide health insurance would be required
to pay an unemployment tax surcharge to the state. Businesses
providing insurance for the first time would be entitled to tax
credits.
   The House, unlike the Senate, voted to exempt businesses with
nine or fewer full-time employees from mandatory coverage. McGovern
said Wednesday night her chamber would consider the exemption.

   Here is a transcript of President
Reagan's remarks Thursday at the conclusion of the two-day NATO
summit.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Good afternoon. My alliance colleagues and I have just concluded
our latest round of consultations on the full range of issues
facing us.
   First let me say the state of the alliance is excellent. We're
strong, we're united, we're prosperous and we're free.
   This is the second full-fledged alliance summit that I've
attended. Some of my colleagues and I also met here following my
first meeting with Mr. Gorbachev. So, while this is a special
occasion, it is also only one element of a much larger pattern of
close and continuous consultations that is a fundamental reason for
the success of this alliance.
   NATO will soon begin its fifth decade. The North Atlantic
Alliance is the most successful in history. While other alliances
have been formed to win wars, our fundamental purpose is to prevent
war while preserving and extending the frontiers of freedom.
   The INF treaty is the most recent NATO success. My colleagues
and I are all justifiably proud of that achievement. It was a
direct result of our steadfastness and persistence in carrying out
the two-track decision that we made as an alliance over eight years
ago. It goes without saying that our allies support this treaty and
every leader solidly reaffirmed its value to the security concerns
of the alliance.
   So now our focus turns on meeting the challenges of the future.
During the past two days we went over the full range of issues that
affect our collective security. I reiterated the strong bipartisan
support that exists for the alliance in the United States and the
commitment that American troops will remain in Europe under any
administration so long as the need for a forward defense of our
common values remains.
   We cannot and will not put our peace and freedom and that of our
children and their children at risk. All of us understand the
absolute necessity of maintaining the credibility of our deterrent.
We will never trade that credibility away at the negotiating table
and we won't give it away through neglect.
   The most direct threat to our security and to stability in
Europe lies in the Soviet Union's massive military presence. The
alliance has given its needs a lot of thought, knows what it wants
to do and has programs that it is committed to carry out. And
there's no doubt the alliance stands on strength and unity.
   The alliance is the most dynamic force for improvement of
East-West relations. From our meetings here, our commitment is to
move forward to meet our defense requirements while continuing
discussions on our four-part agenda with the new Soviet leadership.
   The alliance has agreed on its arms control priorities and is
ready to get down to business. NATO fully supports my effort to
negotiate deep reductions in strategic weapons. So while arms
reduction is a part, but only a part, of our discussions, progress
in this area must always be based on enhancing our security, not
substituting for it.
   Our alliance has guaranteed peace in Europe and the North
Atlantic for almost 40 years. I am more confident than ever after
these two days of meetings that the alliance remains on the right
path and that as always we have the courage and the will to follow
it.
   Let me conclude by noting that this will be one of the last
alliance meetings for Secretary General Peter Carrington. Lord
Carrington has been at the helm of the alliance of NATO for four
crucial years. He has steered this ship of 16 states with the
steadiness that has earned our unbounded admiration. I am sure that
I speak for all my colleagues in expressing our heartfelt thanks to
Lord Carrington and our best wishes to Dr. Manfred Woerner, whose
strong hand will soon be at the helm.
   The West has no better champions than these two distinguished
statesmen.

<HEAD>Rain, Snow Across Nation's Midsection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm system produced showers and thunderstorms across the
lower Mississippi Valley as snow fell on other parts of the
nation's midsection and tornadoes were reported in Louisiana and
Texas.
   Behind the storm system, which was centered over southeastern
Oklahoma, snow advisories were posted Wednesday across parts of
Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas. Up to 7 inches of snow fell
in the Texas Panhandle.
   Several tornadoes were reported near Duson and Lafayette, La.
One person was injured at Duson and 28 aircraft were damaged at the
Lafayette Regional Airport. A tornado ripped the roofs off mobile
homes and temporarily interrupted power in Galveston, Texas.
   Heavy rain and gusty winds accompanied the thunderstorms across
Louisiana. Almost 2 inches of rain fell Wednesday evening at Baton
Rouge. Gusts were clocked at 83 mph in Lafayette as thunderstorms
rumbled across the area.
   Strong wind blew over a house trailer and also caused tree and
power line damage near Baton Rouge. Wind also damaged the roof of a
house at Opelousas and blew a trailer over at Scott.
   Winds were gusty at times behind the storm system; Enid, Okla.,
reported gusts to 46 mph Wednesday night.
   Rain fell from western Oklahoma across parts of Kansas and
Missouri. Almost 2 inches was recorded at McConnell AFB in Wichita,
Kan., on Wednesday evening. Rain also extended east across southern
Illinois and southern Indiana, and showers were reported from
western Tennessee into central Mississippi.
   A flood warning was posted for the Deep Fork River in Oklahoma.
   Snow advisories were posted across parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and
New Mexico. Up to 3 inches of snow was reported at Liberal and
Meade, Kan., and ground blizzard conditions were reported across
the region. Rain was changing to freezing rain and sleet across
south-central Kansas early today.
   Showers also dampened south-central Arizona, scattered sections
of the Pacific Northwest, southern New York state and the New
England seaboard. Snow was falling over northern lower Michigan and
from northeast New York state into northern Vermont and New
Hampshire.
   Showers and thunderstorms were forecast for today from much of
Texas across the lower Mississippi and Tennessee valleys to Georgia
and western South Carolina; rain from southern Missouri across the
Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic states to New Jersey; and snow from
southern New England across New York and northern Pennsylvania,
northern Ohio and central Missouri to parts of New Mexico.
   Highs were expected to be in the 20s or 30s from New England
across the upper Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes region and the upper
half of the Mississippi Valley to the Dakotas; the 60s or 70s from
southern Virginia and the Carolinas across the Gulf Coast states to
the southern half of Texas, and from the desert Southwest across
California to southwest Oregon; a few 80s will appear in extreme
southern Texas and southern Florida. Elsewhere, highs will be in
the 40s or 50s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 5 below
zero at Marquette, Mich., to 71 at Key West, Fla.

   Indians who fled into exile to escape
war and government persecution are returning to their homes on the
Caribbean coast now that hostilities in the region have largely
ceased, a U.N. official said.
   ``The number of returning Indians is increasing dramatically,''
Serge Ducasse, head of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Managua, said in an interview Wednesday.
   Tens of thousands of Miskito, Rama and Sumo Indians left their
tribal homelands beginning in 1981 after the leftist Sandinista
government tried to impose Marxism in the area and said it would
move them to relocation camps.
   The government said then that relocation was necessary because
it had discovered a rebel plot that called for the killing of
Sandinista authorities and Indians who collaborate with the
government.
   Many of the Indians crossed the Rio Coco and sought refuge in
Honduras rather than move to relocation camps. Thousands took up
arms, creating rebel movements that, like the larger Nicaraguan
Resistance, received U.S. aid.
   Now, the Sandinistas have acknowledged mistakes in their
treatment of the Indians and have agreed to work with them to set
up a regional government along the 75-mile seaboard known as the
Mosquito Coast.
   Ducasse said that in 1986, the U.N. agency helped about 2,000
Indians return from Honduran refugee camps to the coast, which is
isolated from most of Nicaragua's 3.1 million people by tradition
and a spine of rugged mountains.
   Last year, 3,206 Indians returned and in the first two months
this year 1,502 returned, said Ducasse.
   Thousands of others returned on their own, without official help.
   ``I think it's the impact of the peace plan,'' Ducasse said.
   A regional peace plan signed in August by Nicaragua, Guatemala,
El Salvador, Honduras, and Costa Rica calls for the countries to
aid the return of refugees. Tens of thousands of people have fled
civil strife in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. The peace
plan also calls for democratic reforms, cease-fires and political
amnesties.
   Fighting continues in Nicaragua despite government talks with
the Contra rebels, who began their insurgency in November 1981. But
the Sandinistas have succeeded in breaking up the Indian rebel
movements.
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge traveled to the coastal city of
Puerto Cabezas in October to accept the amnesty request of Indian
rebel leader Uriel Vanegas and 400 of his troops.
   Borge now is negotiating with another Indian leader, Brooklyn
Rivera.
   The Caribbean coast is both economically and strategically
important for the Sandinistas. Its ports are used to receive Soviet
arms shipments and East bloc supplies, and it is considered most
vulnerable to a foreign invasion.
   The area was given little attention by Nicaraguan governments
until the Sandinistas came to power in July 1979. It was controlled
by the British until the last century and some of the inhabitants
still speak English, along with their own dialects, rather than
Spanish.
   A majority of the 180,000 or so Indians are Protestants, while
the rest of the nation is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.
   ``There is relative calm in the zone now,'' Ducasse said.
   But thousands of non-Indian refugees from Nicaragua still live
in makeshift camps in Honduras.
   Ducasse said that just 136 non-Indian Nicaraguans returned last
year from refugee camps in Honduras.
   ``It will be slow for them to come back,'' Ducasse said. ``Most
of them left conflict zones or to avoid (compulsory) military
service.''

   Following Reagan's four-minute statement before reporters,
Secretary of State George P. Shultz hailed the two-day summit.
``Here was freedom on display,'' he said. ``It was a very moving
experience.''
   The secretary seemed fatigued from his recent Middle East
peacemaking tour, and was leaving immediately for another round of
talks with Arab and Israeli leaders on Reagan's orders.
   NATO Secretary General Lord Carrington said the summit ``gives
me some satisfaction'' because of the 16 alliance leaders' good
will and harmony as they charted future policy.
   The final communique said alliance strategy must be ``based upon
an appropriate mix of adequate and effective nuclear and
conventional forces,'' and that NATO's remaining short-range
nuclear weapons must be improved ``where necessary.''
   The communique avoided the term ``modernization'' of short-range
missiles because of the opposition of West Germany, where most of
the weapons are based.
   Carrington said the allies were concerned that some people might
think ``modernization'' might signal introduction of new, more
destructive weapons. ``Modernization actually means weapons that
are more accurate and possibly less destructive,'' he said.
   The allied leaders expressed solid support for Reagan's efforts
to negotiate sharp reductions in U.S. and Soviet intercontinental
ballistic missiles, and renewed their endorsement of the December
agreement between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
ban ground-launched, medium-range missiles in Europe.
   Carrington said he was heartened that Gorbachev has recognized
the East-West imbalance in European conventional forces that favors
the Eastern bloc and ``is willing to do something about them.''

   At least two people were killed today
in riots outside polling places as the nation voted to choose a new
Parliament in an election marred by a general strike and charges of
fraud.
   Homemade bombs exploded as fighting between supporters of rival
candidates broke out near pollings places in and around Dhaka,
injuring dozens of people, police, witnesses and hospital officials
said.
   Near Dhaka University, a fire station and fire truck were set
ablaze by supporters of opposition parties who charged that workers
from the governing Jatiya Party were trying to steal ballot boxes
at a nearby polling station.
   In Old Dhaka, two people were shot to death in fighting,
hospital officials said. One election official was beaten in front
of reporters at a voting station, and another was reportedly
stripped of his clothes and chased from his post.
   Major opposition parties, which have been trying for four months
to oust President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, called for a boycott of
the election for Parliament and some municipal offices. The
opposition also called a general strike for Wednesday and today in
a bid to disrupt the election.
   On Wednesday, bands of youths hurled bombs, burned cars and
trucks, and shouted anti-government slogans, and at least eight
people were injured.
   In Dhaka, the strike appeared successful Wednesday, shutting
down shops and businesses and leaving streets empty of the bicycle
rickshaws that make Dhaka traffic a nightmare. But the strike
appeared to have little effect outside Dhaka other than preventing
trucks and buses from operating.
   It was the 24th strike called by the opposition since Nov. 10,
when it began its campaign to oust Ershad.
   ``No election, no election,'' young men and teen-agers from
opposition parties shouted today near one polling station in Old
Dhaka. ``Go in there. You won't even find a dog,'' one of them
shouted.
   The gates to the polling station were locked, and armed police
could be seen peaking out of a doorway inside. Witnesses said
homemade bombs had been tossed outside the polling station earlier.
   Outside a nearby voting station in a school, the pavement was
littered with pieces of broken bricks tossed by supporters of rival
candidates for municipal posts.
   The polling station was closed, and election official Muhammad
Akbar Ali, 45, said a gang of youths had burst in and made made off
with five ballot boxes. He said he did not know who the attackers
represented.
   A policeman at the scene, Abul Hasan, said police at opened fire
with blanks to chase away agitators who set off small homemade
bombs.
   After the policeman spoke, a young man wearing on his clothing
the plow symbol of the Jatiya Party began shoving and punching an
election official. He demanded that the polling station be
reopened. Police dragged him away.
   In Narayanganj, an industrial area southeast of Dhaka, an
election official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had
been unable to prevent Jatiya Party supporters from stuffing ballot
boxes.
   In a move to compromise with his opponents, Ershad dissolved the
330-seat Parliament last December, 3{ years before its term was to
expire, and scheduled new elections.
   But opposition leaders have said no election conducted under
Ershad can be fair, and they are urging a voter boycott.
   At least 33 people have been died since Nov. 10, either in
clashes, by police gunfire, or in campaign-related violence.
   Sheik Hasina of the opposition Awami League said she expected
only 5 percent or 10 percent of the 47.8 million voters to cast
ballots.
   More than 900 candidates from 102 political parties are running
for Parliament. Eighteen candidates, all from Ershad's Jatiya
Party, already have been declared elected for lack of opposition,
and voting in one district was canceled because a candidate was
killed.
   In addition to the Parliamentary election, municipal elections
will be held in the cities of Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, and
Rajshahi.
   In similar polling for town and village councils three weeks
ago, more than 100 people were killed in battles between supporters
of candidates.
   Ershad seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and won election
in 1986. He ordered 9,000 army troops and about 290,000 local
police and paramilitary troops deployed to ensure security for the
elections.

   Eight people died and at least 25
others were injured early today when one passenger train rammed
into a second one standing in a railway yard in this northern city,
a government spokesman said.
   Maximo Regidor said rescue workers recovered the bodies of eight
people, seven men and a young woman, trapped in the wreckage of a
sleeping car just after noon.
   The accident happened just after 3 a.m., when the north-bound
Madrid-Bilbao express of the state-owned railway company RENFE
rammed the stationary Madrid-Santander express train, he said.
   Valladolid is 112 miles northwest of the Spanish capital.
   Regidor said two of the victims were government officials of the
northern Cantabria region, and he identified them as Felix Ducasse
and Vicente Alcon.
   Regidor said the young woman was estimated to be between 15 and
18 years of age.
   ``Initially it appears the cause of the accident was a brake
failure,'' he said.
   Spanish National Radio reported 25 people were treated for minor
injuries at local hospitals and released.

   A 9-year-old girl whose lower legs were amputated
after she suffered frostbite has recovered well enough to ride a
bicycle and could be ``on roller skates'' next week, hospital
officials say.
   Darlwin Carlisle may leave the hospital within two weeks, Dr.
Paula Jaudes, who is supervising Darlwin's care at La Rabida
Children's Hospital and Research Center, said Wednesday.
   ``I expect that we'll have Darlwin on roller skates a week from
Friday,'' said physical therapist Roberta Kuchler-O'Shea, who is
helping the Gary, Ind., youngster learn to use artificial limbs.
   A construction worker found the girl locked in the freezing
bedroom attic of her family's apartment Jan. 17. Authorities
believe the girl was left there several days earlier by her mother,
who has pleaded innocent to felony neglect.
   Doctors at the University of Chicago's Wyler Children's Hospital
determined they could not save Darlwin's lower legs, and they
amputated Jan. 23. The girl later was transferred to La Rabida to
be fitted with artifical limbs.
   According to hospital spokeswoman Kris Bangert, custody of
Darlwin is to be decided by the state of Indiana.
   The child's father, James Carlisle, of Fort Wayne, has said he
wants custody. Foster parents are also an option, Ms. Bangert said.
   While at La Rabida, Darlwin has learned how to put on her
artificial legs and progressed from walking with the help of
parallel bars to using a walker, Ms. Jaudes said.
   The girl should be able to walk unassisted by next week, she
said.
   Ms. Kuchler-O'Shea said Darlwin is learning to resume activities
she could do before, such as bicycling and roller skating.
   The girl has learned to pedal a stationary bicycle and has
received a real bicycle _ a pink one with training wheels _ that
she has ridden in hospital halls and soon should be able to take
outside.

   An explosion rocked a dynamite factory
early today, killing at least four people and leaving one missing,
local officials said.
   The explosion at the factory in Ablon, near this port city in
the Calvados region of Normandy, was the third there since 1985.
   Today's blast occurred shortly after the factory opened at 9
a.m., police said. The regional prefecture said the explosion
apparently occurred during the handling of nitroglycerine.
   An explosion at the factory in March 1985 killed three people.
An explosion in March 1987 destroyed a storage area where
nitroglycerine was kept but caused no injuries. The factory was
closed for several months following that blast.

<TEXT>
   Excavators led by a former American
Green Beret are digging in an old Spanish fort for buried treasure,
raising an outcry from Filipino nationalists and bemused skepticism
in the Manila press.
   The loot is believed to be part of a fortune in gold which
legend says was buried by the Japanese in World War II. Estimates
on its value range as high as $200 billion, more than enough to pay
off this country's $29 billion foreign debt.
   But the search has also raised charges in a nationalist-minded
Congress that foreigners are desecrating hallowed ground where
Filipino and American soldiers died and where the country's
national hero, Jose Rizal, was imprisoned before his execution in
1898.
   ``I have nothing against people having high hopes,'' wrote
columnist Larry Sipin in the newspaper Malaya. ``But when those who
rule us act as if our only hope lies in a pot of gold at the end of
a rainbow, or at the bottom of Fort Santiago, we're in trouble.''
   Rumors have circulated for decades that Japanese Gen. Tomoyuki
Yamashita buried a fortune in gold and jewels which he looted from
Southeast Asia before his transfer to the Philippines near the end
of the war. Yamashita was hanged as a war criminal in 1946.
   Last month, a team led by Charles McDougald, a former Green
Beret captain and official of the Las Vegas-based International
Precious Metals Inc., began digging at Fort Santiago, a Spanish
fortress used by the Japanese as a prison during the war.
   McDougald says his group was hired in 1975 by former President
Ferdinand Marcos to search for the treasure. According to
McDougald, Robert Curtis, president of International Precious
Metals, pinpointed more than 170 sites but then fled to the United
States, fearing Marcos would double-cross him.
   McDougald told reporters later today he had evidence that
Marcos, who was ousted in a civilian-military revolt in 1986,
uncovered $6 billion in treasure from the site in 1983. He did not
specify the evidence.
   Marcos today urged the government to ignore a treasure-hunting
craze that has swept the country and work instead to end the
communist insurgency.
   ``After all the sacrifices, all they (officials) are talking
about now is money, money, money,'' Marcos told radio staion DZMM
in Manila from his exile home in Honolulu. ``What will happen to
the communists who are attempting to takeover the country? That is
what our priority should be.''
   Marcos spoke in Tagalog, the main Philippine language. His
remarks were translated by The Associated Press. He also denied
published reports in Manila that he had recovered billions of
dollars in gold from the fort.
   Under an agreement with President Corazon Aquino's government,
McDougald's team can keep 25 percent of whatever it finds. The rest
goes to the Philippine treasury. McDougald told reporters this week
he expects to find the booty within two weeks.
   The dig began in secret but word leaked out when the fort was
closed to the public and Filipino reporters began noticing troops
of the elite Presidential Security Group guarding the site.
McDougald and presidential aides then confirmed the excavation
after two Filipino workers were killed when the tunnel in which
they were digging collapsed.
   Catalino Macaraig, presidential executive secretary, told
reporters that the permit was issued ``in accordance with the rules
and regulations of treasure hunting'' and that the government's
interest would be protected.
   But Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, a former defense minister,
complained that the excavation was an insult to national honor. The
Senate unanimously approved a non-binding resolution to halt the
dig.
   The upper chamber then subpoenaed McDougald to appear before a
Senate committee investigating the project.

<HEAD>Script Writers Ready to Strike, But Agree to More Talks with
Producers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for the Writers Guild of America
and movie and television producers agreed to meet again, after the
writers' union rejected the producers' latest offer and authorized
a strike.
   ``We are ready to strike,'' George Kirbo, president of the West
Coast unit of the guild, said Wednesday after members, who voted in
Los Angeles and New York over two days, overwhelmingly approved a
strike.
   Of 2,411 ballots cast, 97 percent of the writers on both coasts
voted to reject the producers' offer and 96 percent voted to
authorize a strike, said union spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.
   Negotiators for the writers and producers planned to meet today
to see if a strike can be averted, union officials said.
   First to feel the impact of a walkout would be daily daytime TV
programs and talk shows that use the most scripts with the least
lead time, such as Johnny Carson's ``Tonight Show'' and ``Late
Night with David Letterman.''
   The effects on prime-time programs and feature films would be
slight unless a strike was extended.
   The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
announced that it had agreed to the latest negotiations even before
East Coast writers finished voting on whether to reject the latest
contract offer and authorize a strike.
   The strike sentiment was already clear, based on the mood of
West Coast members of the Writers Guild of America who voted
Tuesday night after union leaders unanimously recommended that the
pact be rejected. The West Coast unit represents about 6,500 of the
union's 9,000 members.
   The last strike by writers was three years ago and lasted two
weeks before writers voted to accept a contract that was
essentially the same as the one they had rejected before that
walkout.
   Many minor issues were resolved in a 21-hour bargaining session
that lasted until 7 a.m. Tuesday. but the union and producers
remained deadlocked on three items that each side considers vital:
   A ``creative rights'' issue that would give original writers
more more control over how their work is rewritten and ultimately
presented; residual payments for foreign distribution; and a
revision of residuals for domestic syndication of one-hour
programs, a market that is drying up.
   Producers have resisted union demands on the first two issues,
insisting that a writer's control over the script after it is sold
should be bargained individually, and that they can't afford to
increase foreign residuals.
   The producers are seeking the syndication revision, which the
union opposes the change as a roll-back in current benefits.
   Under the producers' proposal, one-hour programs could be
syndicated locally with writers receiving only 50 percent of their
normal residuals. If the program is later syndicated nationally,
they would receive an additional 100 percent of residuals.
   The median annual income for writers is $40,000, but about half
of the WGA's members are unemployed at any given time. The old pact
expired Tuesday.

   They are political prisoners, branded ``enemies of
the people'' under Stalin. They have been banished to a ramshackle
fishing village in the Soviet north, where they live alongside, but
apart from, villagers.
   Their names are Luzga and Kopalych, and they are the heroes of a
new Soviet film that illustrates the country's confusion after the
death of Josef V. Stalin in March 1953 and its continuing attempt
to come to grips with the dictator's legacy.
   In ``The Cold Summer of '53,'' by producer Alexander Proshkin,
the two exiles are the only village dwellers who do not submit when
their settlement near the Finnish border is seized by six common
criminals who were freed in a prison amnesty that followed Stalin's
death.
   The others, including a mustachioed old captain whose cabin is
decorated with a portrait of Stalin, allow themselves to be put
under lock and key, or even cross the line between obeying their
armed captors and seeking to help them.
   Luzga and Kopalych resist, and kill off the criminals, one by
one.
   The film, shown to Moscow-based journalists Wednesday night at
the Foreign Ministry Press Center, seems an apt summary of the
terrible paradoxes of the Stalin era, when innocent people could be
convicted of crimes, and those who committed injustices could be
honored members of the community.
   ``Cold Summer'' is the latest Soviet artistic work dealing with
the Stalinist legacy to emerge under Communist Party chief Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's loosened restrictions on depicting the often
troubled Soviet past and Stalin's 29-year reign.
   ``Confession,'' a film by Georgian director Tengiz Abuladze
released in late 1986, portrays a pudgy, mustachioed Communist
Party official that Soviet audiences immediately recognized as
Lavrenti Beria, the feared head of Stalin's secret police.
   Beria's image also makes a small appearance in ``Cold Summer,''
in a scene that shows the contradictory feelings Soviets still have
for Stalin and his henchman.
   A policeman, who will become the first villager killed by the
amnestied criminals, spies a portrait of Beria in a publication
lying in the captain's house.
   He starts to rip out the picture, but the captain stops him.
   ``By what instructions do you destroy portraits?'' asks the
captain, ever the fearful bureaucrat.
   The policeman tosses Beria's picture away, but it is picked up,
carefully smoothed out and saved by one of the leading members of
the small fishing community, a man who will later do more than
anyone else to assist the criminals.
   Luzga is a gaunt Red Army veteran with the drawn features and
permanent 5-day-old whiskers of a Soviet Indiana Jones. Played by
veteran actor Valery Priemykhov, Lyzga is often lost in reverie,
and scoffs at the suggestion that he might one day be able to
return to his former life.
   ``Were you ever in Moscow?'' a blonde-haired village girl asks
him at one point.
   ``I don't remember,'' he says with a blank look.
   The gray-haired, baggy-eyed Kopalych is played by Anatoly
Papanov, who died after filming his last scene in ``Cold Summer''in
August. The film was completed in November.
   Papanov's gruff voice is familiar to Soviet children as the
voice of a wolf in a popular cartoon series broadcast by state-run
television.
   The plot of ``Cold Summer'' is reminiscent of countless cowboy
movies where mild-mannered characters find the strength in
themselves to resist injustice, and go on to slay the villains.
   Many in the audience of journalists, Foreign Ministry officials
and guests applauded when Luzga killed one of the more odious
criminals with a pistol shot to the head.
   He finished off the gang's fleeing ringleader by wading into the
water and drowning him.
   Proshkin, 47, who appeared at the screening to present his film
and answer questions, acknowledged the movie's script was a ``pure
Western,'' when he got it, but said he had tried to made something
more eclectic with a political edge.
   ``The average spectator today in the country is young,''
Proshkin said. ``You need strong action to get across the moral and
political point of view.''
   Proshkin was 13 when Stalin died, and said he hopes his film
will deliver a political message about the Stalin era to the
country's youth.
   ``I think the current generation is less politicized than mine
was,'' he said.

<HEAD>Residents Ignore Evacuation Order: Join Firefighters Battling
Brush Fire</HEAD>

   Residents ignored evacuation orders and
joined firefighters battling a wind-fueled brush fire that
threatened dozens of homes in rural Central Florida near the Ocala
National Forest.
   About 475 acres had burned by early today, but no homes were
destroyed and no injuries were reported. Police, state forestry
firefighters and U.S. Forest Service workers battled flames sparked
Wednesday and fueled by gusty winds.
   ``The fire's under control,'' Florida Forestry Division
spokesman David Bucher said this morning. Fire crews would check
today for flareups, he said.
   Katherine Henrie, 64, was among the residents of the remote Lake
Kathryn Heights neighborhood who stayed with their homes. As
towering flames threatened to consume a nearby house, she sprayed
her yard with a garden hose.
   ``They told me to leave but I got no place to go if I did,''
said Mrs. Henrie. ``I'll just lose everything I have. I got no
insurance. They just told me to keep watering the best I could. I
got the sprinkler going over there and three dogs waiting in the
car.''
   Late winter and early spring are generally are the worst times
for brush fires in Central Florida. Pastures and woodlands become
tinder-dry and frost often has killed grass to create hay in
underbrush, which becomes fire fodder.

<HEAD>Parole Board Reverses Decision; Convicted Cop Killer Must Remain
Behind Bars</HEAD>

   A man convicted of killing two police
officers in 1963 must remain behind bars at least three more years,
a Parole Board has ruled in revoking an earlier decision to release
him.
   After two hours of closed-door discussions, the board voted 4-3
Wednesday to cancel Thomas Trantino's March 15 release, set by two
members in January. It was the second time Trantino, who has spent
nearly 25 years in prison, came within a hair of parole.
   Trantino was convicted of shooting of two Lodi police officers
in 1963. He originally was sentenced to the electric chair, but the
penalty was changed to life in prison when the death penalty law
was struck down in 1972.
   The possibility of parole sparked a candlelight vigil, a
petition drive and a letter-writing campaign in recent weeks. The
day after a television show on the case, 1,000 people called the
board to argue against parole.
   Those opposed to Trantino's release, including police and
relatives of his victims, expressed relief at the board's decision.
   ``Crime is on a runaway train in this country, and a crime of
this type needs an appropriate punishment,'' said Lodi Police Chief
Andrew Voto, brother of one victim.
   In Wednesday's decision, the board ruled that Trantino must
remain behind bars for more than three years, but it left open
exactly when he will again be eligible for parole. Parole Board
Chairman Louis Nickolopoulos said the panel will decide that later.
   In 1980 the board said he could be released if he made
restitution to relatives of his victims. After a court fight the
panel decided in 1982 that he should remain in prison.
   Nickolopoulos, asked about Trantino's reaction, said: ``There
was no comment. He was very calm. He was very courteous and polite
throughout the hearing.''
   Trantino's wife, Charlee, whom he married while on a prison
furlough, said she her husband ``doesn't feel any bitterness toward
anyone.''
   Trantino's lawyer, Stuart F. Pierson, who has criticized what he
called undue pressure on the Parole Board by police and others,
said he wasn't certain whether the denial will be appealed.
   Nickolopoulos said he could not discuss the reasons for the
panel's decision until Trantino is notified in writing. The board
has 21 days to inform the inmate, who then has 14 days to ask for a
reconsideration. If he is denied again, he can appeal to the courts.
   Trantino, 50, now in a medium-security prison in Camden, was
convicted for the murders of Sgt. Peter Voto and patrolman Gary
Tedesco.
   The two were investigating a report of a disturbance at tavern
when they were surprised, partially stripped and shot dead by
Trantino and an accomplice. The accomplice was fatally shot the
next day by police.

   A lawmaker in a black homeland
where rival political groups are engaged in a bloody power struggle
was shot to death at home as he and his children watched
television, police said today.
   The 36-year-old legislator, Petrus Mbatha, was a member of
Inkatha, a Zulu political organization that has been locked in the
fierce feud in KwaZulu homeland with backers of militant
anti-apartheid groups.
   Mbatha lived near Camperdown on the fringe of the area around
the Natal province capital of Pietermaritzburg, where more than 400
people have been killed in the feud since early last year.
   Police said it was not known who killed Mbatha late Wednesday,
but reported finding cartridges from Soviet-made AK-47 automatic
rifles. Police regularly link these weapons to members and
supporters of the outlawed African National Congress, the main
guerrilla group fighting to end white-minority domination.
   Inkatha's prinicpal rival in the Natal power struggle has been
the United Democratic Front, South Africa's largest anti-apartheid
coalition.
   Last week, the government banned the UDF from political activity
and barred several of its senior leaders from further involvement
with the organization. Several of these leaders had been involved
in negotiations aimed at halting the Inkatha-UDF feud, and the
government's action was widely viewed as undermining the peace
process.
   Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of Inkatha and chief minister of
KwaZulu, contends UDF cooperates with the African National Congress
in a campaign to seize control of black townships and oust black
moderates who oppose violence.
   UDF leaders have criticized Buthelezi for refusing to support
militant anti-apartheid strategies such as boycotts and sanctions.
   This week, the government reinforced its security forces around
Peitermaritzburg with 300 so-called ``instant constables'' _ black
policemen assigned to duty after relatively short training programs.
   The Law and Order Ministry has declined to comment on
allegations most of the new constables are Inkatha members.
   Buthelezi describes Inkatha as a Zulu cultural organization,
although it functions as KwaZulu's dominant political party.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   The leader of the extreme
right-wing Conservative Party said today that victories in two
special parliamentary elections show growing white support for his
staunchly pro-apartheid policies.
   The Conservatives won decisively Wednesday in the rural
Transvaal province districts of Standerton and Schweizer-Reneke
despite an intensive campaign by President P.W. Botha's National
Party.
   They had won the seats in May's national white elections, but
the winners were forced to resign, one on a technicality, the other
because of bankruptcy.
   In both contests, the Conservatives substantially increased
their margin of victory.
   Conservative Party leader Andries Treurnicht said the victories
would ``have a snowball effect.''
   Botha called them ``temporary disappointments'' for the National
Party.
   ``Foreign interference as well as actions by radical elements
that break internal laws undoubtedly cause aversion to patriotic
voters,'' he said without elaborating.
   The Conservatives are favored to win another special election
later this month and appear likely to cut into National Party
support in nationwide municipal elections in October.
   Chris Van Den Heever, the Conservatives' chief spokesman in
Transvaal, predicted the 8-year-old party would take control of
local councils throughout rural areas of Transvaal. He said the
party also expected to do well in coastal areas where many whites
have protested the recent opening of beaches to blacks.
   Van Den Heever said the National Party, in an effort to preserve
its support, would place increasing emphasis on security issues. He
predicted the government would launch some type of law-and-order
campaign.
   The independent Pretoria News said in an editorial today:
``After being fed a diet of National Party racism for decades, it
is not surprising that the farmers ... voted for the old precepts
of that party as espoused now by Treurnicht.''
   The Conservative Party seeks to reinstate all rescinded
apartheid laws. It charges that Botha is capitulating to the
country's 26 million black majority through his limited reforms of
recent years.
   Botha maintains his reforms will not threaten ``white
interests,'' which he promises will be protected through continued
segregation of housing, schools and health services.
   The National Party, which has been in power since 1948,
advocates limited power-sharing, with blacks gaining a say in
national politics, but whites maintaining power. It firmly controls
the 178-member white chamber of Parliament, with 133 seats to the
Conservatives' 22, though the Conservatives won 26 percent of the
votes nationwide last May.
   The anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party, which has 17 seats
in the white chamber, did not field any candidates in Wednesday's
two by-elections.
   Both the National and Conservative parties rely largely on
support from Afrikaners, descendants of the 17th-century Dutch
settlers who comprise about 3 million of the 5 million whites.
   South Africa's Parliament has separate chambers for whites,
Asians and people of mixed-race. Blacks are excluded.

<HEAD>U.S. Law To Close PLO Mission Assailed By General Assembly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. official said the General Assembly
acted prematurely when it voted in emergency session to order the
United States to submit to binding arbitration its plan to close
the PLO U.N. mission.
   The vote Wednesday was 143-1. America's Western allies joined
the majority. Israel cast the only dissenting vote. The United
States did not vote.
   Arab diplomats hinted the United Nations might have to leave New
York if the U.S. government insists on enforcing an anti-terrorism
law that would close the Palestine Liberation Organization mission
by March 21.
   The U.S. deputy permanent representative, Herbert S. Okun,
called the special session ``inappropriate and premature.''
   Although U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters was not present
Wednesday, he has said various branches of the government are
discussing the issue and its legal implications.
   Clovis Maksoud, Arab envoy, said America was opening ``a
Pandora's box of diplomatic, legal and political problems'' by
trying to close the mission and putting U.S. domestic legislation
above international treaty obligations.
   Most diplomats, however, said a move from New York was
undesirable and unlikely. The PLO has non-voting, observer status
at the United Nations.
   Maksoud, representative of the League of Arab States, told a
news conference Congress should repeal the anti-terrorism law and
said President Reagan could exclude the PLO U.N. mission from
application of the law.
   Maksoud said the issue is a problem between the United States
and the United Nations, not the PLO.
   ``This demonstrates the level of embarrassment for the United
States. It is opening a Pandora's box of political, legal and
diplomatic problems,'' he said.
   Alexander M. Belonogov, Soviet ambassador, called the dispute a
``self-inflicted wound'' to U.S. prestige.
   The United Nations and the State Department say the U.S. law
would violate international law and the Headquarters Agreement of
1947 that allows all U.N. missions to operate.
   The United States said it has not decided if it will implement
the measure calling for closing of the PLO mission.
   The assembly also voted 142-0 to ask the International Court of
Justice in The Hague to rule whether the United States has the
right to refuse arbitration. The United States and Israel did not
vote.
   General Assembly votes are considered expressions of
international will and mainly carry moral authority. They are not
legally binding and there is no enforcement mechanism. Assembly
resolutions are often ignored or defied.
   The assembly decided to reconvene and consider its next move if
the United States goes ahead and orders the PLO mission closed.
   The United States so far has rejected arbitration provided in
the Headquarters Agreement for dispute settlement. It is the first
time the clause has been invoked. The next step will be a Justice
Department announcement on whether it will enforce the new law.
   The World Court is also expected to submit an opinion on whether
the United States has to submit disputes to binding arbitration.
   America and other nations have disregarded court rulings in the
past.
   Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli ambassador, called the PLO a
terrorist organization whose commitment to armed struggle conflicts
with the U.N. Charter. He walked out when PLO Representative Zehdi
Labib Terzi said Israel has disregarded ``norms of civilized
behavior.''

   Minority students who took over a
Hampshire College dormitory office for nine days to protest alleged
campus racism headed back to class today, saying they were relieved
the sit-in was over.
   ``I think everybody's pretty much exhausted,'' said Anita
Fearman, a spokeswoman for the 40 black, Hispanic and other
minority students who ended the takeover Wednesday with the signing
of a 16-point agreement designed to encourage racial harmony at the
private school, where about 100 of the 1,100 students are
minorities.
   Fearnab and 20 other protesters were among the 150 students who
watched as college President Adele Simmons and two other
administrators signed the document outside the office that had been
occupied since Feb. 23.
   The settlement provided for a dean of multicultural affairs, an
adviser for the group that occupied the Dakin House office and at
least $4,500 in yearly funding for the group. The administration
also agreed not to discipline the students, and to allow them to
make up work missed during the takeover.
   ``I think the occupation strengthened the institution,'' said
Simmons. ``For the last several years we've been working to improve
student life and this represents a finishing of the old agenda.''
   Fearman said the protesters were relieved to trade in their
sleeping bags for dormitory beds, although ``a few are feeling that
it will be hard not to have each other for support 24 hours a
day.'' She said the protesters had begun returning to classes
Wednesday afternoon.
   The occupation began a week after the end of a takeover at
nearby University of Massachusetts that was sparked by campus
racial violence. That takeover ended when Chancellor Joseph Duffey
agreed to increase funding of minority student programs and to
other demands.
   Hampshire protesters said racial violence is rare at their
school, but the college had long ignored their concerns.
   College officials said the allegation was a surprise, given the
school's aim to be a progressive alternative to the traditional
liberal arts education offered at nearby Amherst, Mount Holyoke and
Smith colleges. Hampshire students design their own courses of
study and must complete individual research projects and pass three
divisional examinations to graduate.
   The protesters, however, said that the settlement and the
sympathy shown them by the college community, which organized
rallies and sent food to the protesters throughout the occupation,
had changed their minds about warning minorities away from the
school.
   ``I really would tell them to come here,'' said protester Penny
Predmas.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was something unheard of among the mild and
compliant commuter ranks in London, but it happened this week _ an
underground revolt.
   The underground in this case was a subway train on the aging
Northern Line of the London Regional Transport system.
   The riders were told Tuesday night to get off their
delay-plagued train five stops before their destination and wait
for the next train. A signal failure was blamed.
   Not a rare occurrence.
   What was rare was that they balked.
   Transport spokesman David Morris said the passengers, bound for
High Barnet at the end of the Northern Line, started filing off.
That's what London subway riders always do. Grumbling, maybe, but
obeying orders.
   But then, according to the London Evening Standard newspaper, a
``mild-looking and well-dressed'' passenger declared: ``I've had
enough. I'm staying put. If we all do it, they'll have to take the
train on.''
   He was among about a dozen passengers who got back into the
train, the paper said. More passengers followed. After hurried
consultations the staff gave in and waved the train on.
   London Regional Transport called the subway mutineers selfish.
   Morris complained to The Associated Press. ``Those passengers
had only a narrow and selfish view and put their needs above
others.''
   But the Standard newspaper hailed it as ``The Great Tube
Revolt'' _ the subway is known as the tube in Britain _ and called
the unidentified leader ``a superhero in the Clark Kent mold _
quiet, mild-mannered and unassuming.''
   The paper quoted passenger Sheila Golding of High Barnet as
saying the rebels cheered and laughed, because ``we knew that if
everyone did it _ and stayed put _ there wasn't anything they could
do about it.''
   It quoted passenger Maria Gama as saying: ``Everybody was just
totally fed up. The waiting room was freezing and nobody could tell
us why the train was stopping where it did. But when everybody
climbed back on, it was a marvelous moment.''
   The Northern Line, which carries 700,000 passengers between
south and north London, is sometimes called ``The Misery Line'' by
newspapers and criticized for defective trains and equipment,
last-minute schedule changes, signal failures and dirty stations.
   Morris denied the line was worse than others.
   But none of that mattered.
   The meek, mild, patient, uncomplaining London subway riders had
had their day.

<HEAD>Gets Story Published In Yugoslav Magazine First Time In 34 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Milovan Djilas, Yugoslavia's best
known dissident and a former vice president, got a short story
published in a regular literary magazine for the first time in 34
years.
   The story, titled ``The War,'' was published Wednesday in the
Knjizevne Novine periodical of Belgrade. It deals with a summary
execution of a young deserter in the presence of his parents during
World War II.
   In a note, the editors of the March 1-15 issue that reached news
stands Wednesday, stressed, ``We have no intention today ... to
engage in assessing the political ideas, stands and programs of
Milovan Djilas.''
   It said that ``publishing the literary work of Milovan Djilas, a
test of his artistic achievement by the literary public, will
confirm ... the democratic strength of the principled attitude'' of
the Yugoslav leadership ``toward cultural creativity.''
   ``We believe that freedom of art creations and autonomy of an
artistic work are a major achievement of our policy and our
culture,'' the editors said.
   Djilas, a top partisan leader, emerged from the war as heir
apparent to Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who became Yugoslavia's first
president.
   However, after he began writing articles displaying his
disenchantment with communism in the early 1950s and then published
his first book, ``The New Class,'' Djilas fell into disgrace and
spent about nine years in jail.
   Last September, a Belgrade company said it was considering
publishing Djilas' book ``The Revolutionary War,'' known in the
West under the title ``War-Time.''
   No book or article by Djilas, now 76, has been officially
published in Yugoslavia after his fall from favor.
   But Djilas received a passport in January 1987 and has traveled
widely since.
   Knjizevne Novine, in its 40th anniversary issue, put Djilas'
name on the front page listing its contributors.
   ``Removing the silently perpetuated taboo (on publishing his
work), now that administrative obstacles no longer exist, means
permitting a potentially worthy work to establish itself in a place
that belongs to it _ or to lose it, should it prove worthless,''
the editors' note said.

   County officials are searching for a hospice
to care for a male prostitute acquitted of attempted poisoning
charges after selling his AIDS-tainted blood.
   ``Right now, it is hard to place a person like that,'' said Eric
Rofes, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Community Services
Center.
   Joseph Markowski, 29, was acquitted Wednesday by a Superior
Court jury on two counts of attempted poisoning. Jurors decided he
lacked the intent required under state law to kill or injure
someone by selling his blood.
   ``What he did was inexcusable, but we had to follow the law,''
juror William E. Ferguson said after the verdict was read. ``I hope
they will come up with a law to prevent people from doing this in
the future.''
   ``We need legislation on this,'' said Deputy District Attorney
Antonio Barreto Jr., who prosecuted the case. ``He can go out and
do this again today, as long as he said, `I just did it for the
money.'''
   Markowski, who suffers from mental illness and carries the AIDS
virus but has not developed the disease, could have faced up to
seven years in prison if convicted.
   He had been accused of selling his tainted blood for $10 to
Plasma Production Associates on June 22 and of trying to do so
again June 25.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome can be spread is by
transfusion of infected blood or blood products. AIDS cripples the
body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and
cancers. There is no known cure.
   Markowski originally was charged with attempted murder, but
Judge Ronald S. Coen dismissed those counts, saying the law
required a specific intent to kill that was not present in the case.
   The homeless prostitute was arrested June 23 after screaming,
``Kill me! Kill me! I have AIDS!'' in a Hollywood bank while
attempting to grab a security guard's gun. Police found his receipt
from the plasma center.
   Court-appointed defense attorney Guy O'Brien said Markowski was
happy to be acquitted but concerned about where he would make his
home.
   ``I don't know what's going to happen to him,'' said Dr. Eugene
Kunzman of the mental health unit at County Jail. ``All the
agencies involved are attempting to do what is best for everyone
involved.''
   Last year, Los Angeles County District Attorney Ira Reiner
lobbied for legislation making it a felony to knowingly sell or
donate AIDS-contaminated blood. The state Assembly failed to
approve it.
   Markowski allegedly admitted to police that he sold his blood
because he needed money and didn't care about the public, but Coen
ruled the statement inadmissible because Markowski had not been
informed of his right to remain silent and wait for an attorney.

   Until Little Richard took the Grammy Awards
hostage for several minutes, the high point might have been Michael
Jackson's Pepsi commercial.
   But seriously, folks, perhaps because no one artist dominated
the awards, Wednesday night's was one of the best Grammy shows in
years.
   Billy Crystal was host of the three-hour CBS special, but New
York _ more specifically Radio City Music Hall _ was the star.
   The show seemed to have gotten a new soul infusion by returning
from Los Angeles. It was broadcast live from the venerable old
Music Hall, all decked out in a brilliantly glitzy art deco set
design that was just made for Cab Calloway to strut across singing
``Minnie the Moocher'' and coaxing the tres cool audience into
joining in on ``Hidy, hidy, hidy ho.''
   But it was Little Richard who stopped the show when he was
supposed to announce the winner for best new artist. Instead, he
ran off with the envelope, insisting, ``The best new artist is _
me!'' A pain to the waiting nominees, but undeniably great
television.
   Richard had come out complaining that co-presenter Buster
Poindexter had stolen his pompadour. ``Everything I get, they take
it from me,'' he said.
   His giggling outburst prompted a standing ovation from the
audience, a fuming ``shut up!'' from Poindexter _ but no Grammy.
Maybe an Emmy if they create a best supporting player on a
self-congratulatory industry awards show.
   Dion represented oldsters without causing trouble; he just came
out and sang ``Why Must I Be a Teen-Ager in Love?'' and wrapped up
the show with ``Runaround Sue.''
   Michael Jackson didn't get any awards during the broadcast, but
he turned in a stunning performance that concluded with an inspired
James Brown-esque gospel number complete with robed choir, even
upstaging his Pepsi trilogy.
   Until Jackson came out, some of the best musical moments were in
the ads. It was a little hard to pay attention to Jackie Mason's
mushy borscht-belt humor _ he was doing Ed Sullivan, for Pete's
sake _ after Eric Clapton's wailing guitar solo on behalf of
Michelob.
   When it came to acceptance speeches, the Irish consciousness
band U2 was in a class by itself. When it won for best performance
by a duo or group, guitarist The Edge thanked, ``Martin Luther King
... Bob Dylan for `Tangled Up in Blue,' Flannery O'Connor, Jimi
Hendrix, Walt Disney, John the Baptist, George Best, Gregory Peck
... Dr. Ruth, Fawn Hall, Batman and Robin ... the YMCA, sumo
wrestlers throughout the world, and of course Ronald Reagan.''
   Later, for best album, lead singer Bono made a self-deprecating
poke at the band's messiah image.
   ``It really is hard having the weight of the world on your
shoulders,'' he said. ``But we enjoy our work.''
   He also added, ``it's hard when there are 60 million people
watching not to talk about South Africa and what's happening there,
... but tonight is maybe is not the night to do that.'' He made his
point.
   As usual, the show was a hodgepodge of American musical tastes,
though the flamboyance level of the rock stars being what it is,
everybody else looked like badly dressed tourists who wandered away
from the bus. How about a segue from Vladimir Horowitz to George
Strait singing ``All My Exes Live in Texas?''
   Crystal's humor depended largely on insider entertainment jokes
_ who cares at this point that ``The Wilton North Report'' got
canceled? He set up the tribute to the Apple with his touching bit
on an old, black jazz musician _ ``Can you dig it? I knew that you
could.'' Unfortunately, the routine plays better in a dark club
than on a glitter-drenched, island-sized stage.
   Steve Allen was funnier. (Crystal later kept crediting Allen
with writing the hottest of the rock numbers.) Allen presented the
best comedy album award with Steven Wright. He led off by
announcing the good news that ``they did find Liza Minelli's
dress.''
   ``Steven asked me to read the list of nominees,'' he said,
``because he suffers from dyslexia. Actually he doesn't suffer from
it, he digs it.''

   Twelve months have passed since 193 people died
aboard the Herald of Free Enterprise. But time has not eased the
pain of Evelyn Pinnells, who lost two daughters when the ferry
capsized off Belgium.
   For Mrs. Pinnells, it has been a year of depression, sleeping
pills and anger that the owners of the ferry have gone unpunished.
Every day she goes to the little cemetery near her home in
Aylesbury. There her daughters, Heidi, 14, and Fiona, 20, and
Fiona's fiance, Jonathan Reynolds, are buried.
   They were among the victims when the Herald of Free Enterprise
capsized off the Beglian port of Zeebrugge on March 6, 1987. It was
the worst peacetime disaster involving a British ship since the
Titanic sank in 1912.
   ``They say that time heals, but I don't think I'll ever get over
it,'' said the divorcee, who survived with her two other children.
   As the salvaged ferry heads for a Taiwan shipyard to be
scrapped, its legacy lingers in shattered lives, police
investigations, compensation disputes and possible charges against
three crewmen and the owners.
   Many survivors haven't been able to return to work.
   Some who lost loved ones have had serious emotional problems.
Others started drinking heavily. Many suffer nightmares and are
afraid of the water. More than 200 policemen involved in the
aftermath have received psychiatric counseling.
   ``It has ruined my life forever,'' said forklift operator Chris
Leach, who rescued Mrs. Pinnells' 12-year-old son.
   ``The things I'd done before, I can't do now. I'm a fisherman
but I can't go fishing. I have a boat but it's locked away on a
farm and I can't even look at it,'' he said.
   Leach says he is even frightened to drive his car through a
carwash.
   Martin Hartley, a 9-year-old boy orphaned in the disaster, is
living with an aunt and back at school. His story touched the
hearts of Britons and helped swell a relief fund that has raised
$10.6 million for survivors and bereaved.
   For ferry owners Townsend Thoresen, it has been a year of change.
   Taken over by P and O just before the disaster, the company has
a new name _ P and O European Ferries Ltd. _ new senior management
and new safety measures on its ships.
   But the threat of corporate prosecution exists, and debate
rumbles on over the safety of the modern roll-on, roll-off ferries,
which have doors on both ends instead of just one to allow faster
loading and unloading of vehicles.
   The company faces a massive compensation bill.
   On Jan. 22, the High Court approved a test case compensation
settlement of more than 165,000 pounds, or $292,000, for a family,
including young children, who lost their father in the disaster.
   Lawyers representing most claimants say that settlement was
expected to become the model for settling more than 300 other
claims.
   Michael Napier, chairman of a committee of lawyers for 300
survivors and relatives of victims, said Wednesday that about 200
had accepted a compensation package from the vessel's owner. He
would not disclose the amounts involved.
   The Herald of Free Enterprise capsized after the sea rushed in
through bow doors that were left open.
   The estimated 543 Britons on board, mainly families returning
from a day's outing in Belgium, had no time to scramble into
lifeboats. The lights went out, furniture flew, the water kept
rising and in the screaming chaos only 350 made it to safety.
   It was over in less than five minutes.
   Dave Wilkinson, head of the Herald Assistance Unit in Dover,
where the ferry was bound, said only three officers of the 42 crew
members who survived have returned to sea.
   An official British inquiry blamed Townsend Thoresen and three
crewmen for allowing the ferry to sail with its bow doors open. It
said no laws were broken but found the company ``from top to bottom
... was infected with the disease of sloppiness.''
   But in October, an inquest jury ruled that the victims were
``unlawfully killed,'' paving the way for possible criminal
proceedings against the company's owners and those blamed for
leaving the bow doors open: Capt. David Lewry, First Officer Leslie
Sabel and Assistant Boatswain Mark Stanley.
   Lewry's Certificate of Competency was suspended for a year after
the inquiry found him ``seriously negligent.'' Sabel lost his
certificate for two years. Stanley, shattered by the tragedy, left
the company on medical grounds.
   On Nov. 13, Kent police were ordered to start a new
investigation, and Belgian judge Arthur d'Hoest's separate
investigation may also bring criminal charges.
   The Herald Families Association, comprising about 150 survivors
and relatives, says it will fund a private prosecution of the
company for corporate manslaughter if Britain's state prosecutor
doesn't.
   ``There are strong feelings of injustice among the families _
very strong. Their children are killed and nobody's doing anything
about it,'' said association president Maurice de Rohan.
   De Rohan, whose daughter and son-in-law were among the dead,
said: ``It was just utter carelessness and indifference. I believe
the company didn't understand what it was doing and didn't
sufficiently care.''
   But P and O chairman Sir Geoffrey Sterling said responsibility
rested on the shipboard staff. He said it was ``a bit far-fetched''
to prosecute those onshore.
   United in grief, hundreds of survivors and relatives will join
together March 6 to mark the first anniversary.
   Some will return to Zeebrugge to drop a wreath in the water
where the Herald capsized. Others will attend a service at St. Mary
The Virgin church in Dover and unveil a commemorative stained-glass
window.
   New British regulations require indicator lights on the bridge
to show that doors are closed, and ferry passengers must have
boarding cards to avoid the kind of confusion over incomplete
passenger lists that hampered the search for survivors in the
Zeebrugge disaster.
   A bill before Parliament includes a two-year jail sentence for
an owner or a master who sails with an unsafe ship.

   A soggy patch of grass alongside Saint
Donaas parish church will be turned into a rose garden in
remembrance of the people who died when the Herald of Free
Enterprise ferry capsized last year.
   But apart for the cars and trucks that lie crushed and rusting,
there are few visible reminders of the maritime tragedy that pushed
this drab port city into the headlines on March 6, 1987.
   ``Can we keep running around with our hands in the air? Do we
have to be in sackcloth and ashes because of the disaster?'' asked
Wim Catry, the priest of Zeebrugge's Saint Donaas parish.
   The ferry, loaded with 543 people and tons of cars and trucks,
capsized after leaving Zeebrugge with its bow doors left open. It
was bound for the British port of Dover, across the English Channel.
   ``It was tragic, but you forget,'' said Andre Pape, 57, captain
of the tug boat Sea Horse, which was the first to reach the
capsized vessel minutes after it sank just ouside the harbor walls.
``We are faced with the force of the sea every day. When one thing
happens, you forget another.''
   After the ship went down, authorities quickly set up a rescue
operation involving ships, divers and helicopters.
   Many lives were saved because of the swiftness and efficiency
that won Belgium international acclaim, but 193 people died.
   Olivier Vanneste, the provincial governor who led the rescue
operations, was one of 31 people, including 13 Belgians, decorated
by Queen Elizabeth II for their conduct in the disaster.
   ``It has been a tribute to the country and all people who
participated in the operation,'' Vanneste said. Officials from
Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Britain have since come here to study
the rescue plan, he said.
   He remembers best the selflessness of people bringing in
blankets and clothing for the rescued Britons and never asking for
reimbursement.
   The steady flow of ferries in and out of the port continues
unabated. ``The boats just keep coming,'' said Catry. ``They might
be a little more careful now. But who can tell?''

<HEAD>NEC Agrees to Pay Consumer Redress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer company has agreed to make refunds
to about 100 consumers who bought memory expansion boards in
response to exaggerated advertising claims, according to the
Federal Trade Commission.
   NEC Home Electronics, a subsidiary of NEC Corp. of Japan, agreed
to pay $15,000 in consumer redress to settle charges that it had
made deceptive claims for some of its computers, the FTC said
Tuesday.
   According to the commission, NEC advertised its PC-8000 series
of computers and accessories from 1981 to 1984, including the claim
that the average person with no training could quadruple the
device's memory by buying accessory equipment.
   The FTC said expanding the memory to that extent required a
skilled programmer or access to a sophisticated operating system
which was never made available in the United States.
   Under the consent agreement, NEC will refund the $150 purchase
price to consumers who bought memory expansion boards for the
computers, which it estimated at about 100 people.
   Purchasers of the boards can contact the company about refunds
by writing to NEC at 1255 Michael Drive, Wood Dale, Ill., 60191.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said today
the Justice Department backs a new Customs Service decision to
seize the passports of Americans suspected of entering the country
with illegal drugs.
   ``We're in favor of it and we're looking now at the legal
aspects of it. I hope we will find legal ways to do that,'' Meese
siad in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``There's no reason that drug traffickers should have freedom to
travel around the world peddling their wares,'' he added.
   William von Raab, the Customs Service commissioner, told the
White House Conference on a Drug-Free America on Wednesday that his
agency, on March 15, will begin taking the passports of Americans
who try to re-enter the country with illegal drugs. Customs Service
spoksman Edward Kittredge said the passports would be seized as
evidence of a crime and forwarded to the State Department.
   Meese also refuted Reagan administration critics who say the
military is not being used to stop the flow of drugs into the
United States.
   ``We've been using the military in this country for six years
against drugs,'' he said, adding, ``They help with the
interdiction. They provide the surveillance, which is what they can
do.''
   Addressing the conference Wednesday, Meese said recalcitrant
bureaucrats and meddling members of Congress are hampering the
federal war on drugs.
   ``I am extremely concerned about the fragmentation that goes on
in Congress,'' he said.
   ``We have 32 different committees in the Congress with
cognizance over the drug problem so that too many of the leaders
who are seated on the stage here are spending their time testifying
in front of congressional committees instead of leading the forces
that ought to be out in the field working on the drug problem.''
   Meese was among four Cabinet members and five other top-ranking
administration officials appearing together on a panel at the
conference.
   Von Raab complained to the estimated 2,000 delegates that
federal bureaucrats are too lax in pushing anti-drug efforts, a
position subsequently embraced by Meese.
   ``I have been flat out told by many bureaucrats that just
because the president is supporting an effort it doesn't mean that
money goes with it,'' von Raab said. ``We don't need a bunch of
bureaucrats that will deal with this war on drugs the way they
dealt with the war in Vietnam. We need heart in this effort. ...
   ``There are still too many people who work for us _ in my
organization as well _ who still have their noses too deeply buried
in their old books.''
   Meese said later, ``I am worried about what Mr. von Raab talked
about: Some people in the trenches who do not have the message.''
   The attorney general called on state and local officials to pour
more money into anti-drug efforts.
   ``If state and local governments will increase their efforts
threefold _ 300 percent _ as the federal government has in the last
seven years _ I think we will have adequate funds to provide the
necessary resources for all aspects, enforcement as well as
treatment,'' he said.

   A 12-year-old boy whose body was found in
a dishwasher may have tried to take a shower in it, his uncle said.
   ``I really believe he crawled in there thinking he could wash up
and crawl back out,'' Darold DeGrand said of his nephew, Michael
Conard, of Humboldt.
   The boy's nude body was discovered by his mother, Jean, 33, when
she returned home from work Tuesday afternoon.
   ``It's a strange situation,'' Brown County Sheriff's Commander
David Zasada said Wednesday. ``Right now we're not looking at this
as foul play.''
   The boy was 4 foot, 10 inches tall and weighed about 90 pounds.
   DeGrand said he was convinced the death was accidental.
   The portable dishwasher was found hooked up to the kitchen sink
and running, Zasada said, and the mother turned it off and found
her son's body inside.
   The uncle said the dishwasher had no safety features to prevent
such an accident. ``It was an older model where, once you shut the
door, if the dial was set right, it kicked in. They bought it
secondhand may years ago.''
   Zasada said investigators were trying to determine whether there
was forced entry or sign of a struggle. There were no external
injuries that might have indicated the boy was shoved into the
dishwasher.
   ``I would certainly not at this time say there was a suicide,''
he said.
   An autopsy to determine the casue of death was inconclusive,
Zasada said, and further tests were planned.

   More than two hours after the NATO
summit ended today, President Reagan said he hadn't read the final

   ``I haven't seen it yet,'' Reagan replied, when a reporter asked

earlier.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker quickly interjected,
``No, we saw it last night. No problems, and it's very good.''
   Taking his cue from Baker, Reagan said, ``Yes, very good, no
problems.''
   The exchange took place during a photo session at the
president's guest house, where he had a post-summit meeting with
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 12th graf, `He eventually...,' to ADD details on where
he lived.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virtuoso violinist Henryk Szeryng, a Polish emigre
and Mexican citizen who gained fame after performing extensively
for Allied troops during World War II, died today in West Germany.
He was 69.
   Szeryng died at 4 a.m. in Kassel, West Germany, of a cerebral
hemorrhage he suffered early Wednesday, his Paris and New York
offices said.
   A recipient of numerous international awards, the violinist was
to have played in Brussels Wednesday night with the Orchestra of
Sarrebruck and begin a U.S. tour in a few weeks.
   ``Real music lovers want emotion _ great moments _ which
Szeryng's playing gives them,'' Arthur Rubinstein, who died in
1982, once said.
   Szeryng had a preference for resurrecting neglected works and
bringing relatively unknown contemporary works to the public. In
1971, he reconstructed and gave the first performance in modern
times of Paganini's Concerto No. 3.
   He made numerous recordings and authored several publications on
technique and interpretation.
   Szeryng was born in Warsaw Sept. 22, 1918 and educated in West
Germany, then in France, where he studied under Gabriel Bouillon
and Nadia Boulanger at the Paris Conservatory. In 1937, he
graduated with the coveted First Prize.
   Szeryng was firmly associated with the French school of violin
playing, although the major musical force behind him was Carl
Flesch.
   At the outbreak of World War II, Szeryng, who spoke eight
languages, was appointed liaison officer and interpreter for Gen.
Wladislaw Sikorski, premier of the Polish government-in-exile and
commander of the Free Polish Army.
   In 1941, he went with Sikorski to Latin America in search of a
home for about 4,000 Polish refugees. The refugees were accepted by
Mexico. Moved by this humanitarian gesture, Szeryng took on Mexican
citizenship in 1946.
   During the war, he performed more than 300 concerts for Allied
troops.
   He eventually became an adviser to the Mexican government on
cultural matters, but he maintained his base in Europe. He lived in
Paris for about 20 years, but for the past five years he lived in
Monaco and went to Mexico about twice a year.
   He was decorated by governments from Italy to Finland, including
France, which gave him its illustrious Legion of Honor in 1984.
   Szeryng made his American debut in Carnegie Hall in 1943 and
went on to make numerous recordings, reaping a Grammy award for one
of them.
   In 1970, he was appointed special music advisor to Mexico's
UNESCO delegation in Paris.
   Encouraged by Rubinstein to extend his musical activities
worldwide, Szeryng did so, increasing his reputation and making
numerous recordings with Rubinstein.
   Funeral services are to be held in Monte Carlo, Monaco, at a
still unspecified date, his Paris office said.

<HEAD>Media Attorney Says Ruling on Exit Polling Sets Precedent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge set a precedent when he struck down
a Florida law that would keep reporters at least 150 feet from
polling places on election days, an attorney for three television
networks said.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus ruled that reporters have a
constitutional right to speak to voters, but said they could be
kept 50 feet away from polling places.
   ``I think Judge Marcus' decision is going to be cited in a lot
of other states besides Florida and will be a significant part of a
body of law which is being formed striking down similar statutes
elsewhere,'' said Floyd Abrams, attorney for the ABC, CBS and NBC
networks.
   The networks, along with The Miami News, argued that reporters
needed to be closer to polling places to conduct exit polls during
next week's Super Tuesday voting.
   ``The decision will make it possible for more people to have
more information more quickly about the Super Tuesday results in
Florida than would have otherwise been conceivable,'' Abrams said.
   Marcus' decision left intact a provision of the law allowing
poll workers to keep the media, campaigners and petitioners 50 feet
away from the polls. David Kraslow, publisher of the News, said
that restriction would not interfere with exit polling.
   The decision is the second Florida ruling in a week against the
150-foot rule. U.S. District Judge Howell Melton in Jacksonville
ruled Friday that petitioners seeking to put a medical malpractice
measure on future ballots could also approach up to a 50-foot limit.
   Reporters ``have a constitutional right to engage in speech or
other expressive activities'' near the polls, Marcus said in his
opinion Wednesday. His decision followed similar rulings by federal
judges in Georgia and Washington state.
   David Leahy, Dade County's elections supervisor and a defendant
in the suit, said the decision left polling officials with
difficult choices.
   Since the Jacksonville ruling applied only to medical
malpractice petitioners and the Miami decision only to the media,
officials would be left in the uncomfortable decision of allowing
some people up to 50 feet away while others had to stay 150 feet
away.
   ``We are looking at abandoning any effort to enforce the
150-foot rule,'' Leahy said.

<HEAD>Student Banished From Homeroom for Singing National Anthem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school senior who has taken
to singing the national anthem aloud when it is played over the
school intercom in the morning has been banished from homeroom for
improper behavior.
   Paul Rennick, principal of North Kingstown High School, said
Sara Sprague is ``playing games'' by violating policy that requires
silence when ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is played on the public
address system each morning.
   But Miss Sprague, 17, says her patriotic expression is a
``spontaneous reaction to the music.''
   Nevertheless, she has spent the last three weeks in the school
office each morning. Katherine Janis, her homeroom teacher, said
the singing and humming was part of ``noisy and disruptive''
behavior on the student's part.
   ``It's not a matter of discipline, it's a matter of the right of
a student to participate in singing the national anthem,'' said
Miss Sprague, a member of the school's concert choir.
   Her mother, Jane Sprague, said she backs her daughter.
   ``It's hard for me to believe that a school supported by local,
state and federal taxes won't let students sing the national anthem
if they want to,'' Mrs. Sprague said. ``I've never been anyplace
where the anthem was played that singing it wasn't welcome.''
   The controversy began last month when Miss Sprague began humming
along with the anthem. She was reprimanded by Ms. Janis.
   The next day Miss Sprague sang, quietly she says, and quickly
found herself in the assistant principle's office for a lecture on
homeroom behavior.
   The issue went public when Miss Sprague wrote a letter to a

   Rebecca Tougas, a member of the student council's executive
board, said the council will take up the issue in a survey of the

   ``This is a pretty patriotic school,'' Rennick said. ``The flag

question of patriotism, it's a question of who's in charge.''

   Iran and Iraq said they fired more
missiles into each other's capitals for the fourth straight day
today. Iraq said women and children were killed in Baghdad and Iran
said 13 people were killed in Tehran.
   Iran also said 20 people were wounded when a missile hit a
hospital in Tehran.
   The missile exchange is the first time both belligerents have
bombarded each other's capitals with missiles since the Persian
Gulf war began in September 1980. It is also the worst escalation
of the so-called ``war of the cities'' since it began in early 1985.
   Iran has listed 30 killed and more than 130 wounded in Tehran
since the Iraqi missiles began crashing into the capital Monday
afternoon. It said another five people were killed in an air raid
on the northern town of Rasht Wednesday.
   Iraq has given no official breakdown of its casualties since
Monday, when Iran fired two missiles into Baghdad, a city of 5
million people. The official Iraqi News Agency has reported only
that ``many civilians'' have been killed or wounded, but given no
figures.
   The news agency said Iraq lobbed two surface-to-surface missiles
into Tehran soon after dawn. Iraqi warplanes also bombed Dezful in
western Iran and the southern city of Shiraz.
   It said the Iraqi pilots ``destroyed their targets, leaving them
gutted by fire.'' It did not elaborate.
   Tehran Radio said the air strikes hit residential areas, killing
13 civilians and wounding 40.
   That raised to 24 the number of missiles the Iraqis claim to
have fired since Tuesday into the Iranian capital, which has a
population of 6 million.
   The Iraqi agency also said another missile was fired into the
holy city of Qom, the cradle of Iran's Islamic revolution and south
of Tehran, around daybreak, when Moslems pray.
   The Iraqis said they have fired three missiles into Qom since
Wednesday morning. The Iraqi agency was monitored in Nicosia.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored
in Nicosia, said that Revolutionary Guards fired two missiles into
Baghdad early today.
   That brought the number of missiles Iran says it has launched
since Monday to 10. Iraq has so far acknowledged that eight hit
Baghdad.
   Tehran Radio quoted military communiques as saying the Iranian
missiles were aimed at Iraq's intelligence headquarters and a
center of the ruling Baath Socialist Party.
   Iraq said both missiles hit residential areas, killing or
wounding ``a number of civilians, including women and children.''
   The agency quoted a military spokesman in Baghdad as saying Iraq
``will make the rulers of Iran taste real agony.''
   Baghdad's army daily, Al-Qadissiya, declared: ``Whole Iranian
cities will be wiped off the map and our missile strikes will
include other cities besides Tehran.
   ``The number of missiles we have used so far is only a sample of
what we have in store to deter the enemy once and for all.''
   IRNA quoted Kamal Kharrazi, a member of Iran's Supreme Defense
Council, as declaring in Tehran that Iran is ``quite capable of
continuing the war of the cities'' until Baghdad stops its
``inhuman attacks.''
   Until Monday, Iran had fired 37 missiles into Baghdad, but the
Iraqis had not launched any in retaliation.
   Western military analysts believe both sides are using
Soviet-made SS-1 missiles, known as Scud-Bs. Western military
analysts were unsure how many the two belligerents had before they
began their long-distance dueling.
   The Iraqis are believed to be firing Scuds fitted with strap-on
boosters to extend their normal 190-mile range to hit Tehran, 290
miles from the Iraqi border.
   Iran does not have problems with range as Baghdad is only 80
miles west of the battleground frontier.
   IRNA quoted a Revolutionary Guards communique as warning that
Iran's ``retaliatory operations, including missile and artillery
attacks, on Iraqi cities will continue powerfully and severely
until the Baghdad regime stops its vicious acts.''
   The missile strikes were the first on Qom, although Iraqi
warplanes bombed the city several times in January last year. Qom,
a city of 250,000 residents, is about as far from the border as
Tehran.

   Michigan would return to a presidential
primary election in 1992 under a bill unanimously approved by a
legislative committee.
   The Senate Government Operations Committee voted 7-0 Wednesday
to replace the current caucus system of selecting presidential
convention delegates with a primary election on the third Tuesday
in March four years from now.
   ``I'd rather have a system more open than we have'' under the
bill, said Sen. Dick Posthumus, R-Alto, sponsor of the measure. But
he noted that Democratic objections to allowing ``crossover''
voting _ Democrats voting in Republican races and vice versa _
forced the party preference provision.
   However, unlike Michigan's earlier presidential primary, voters
would have to designate a party preference at least 30 days before
the election in order to vote. The party preference would be in
effect only for the presidential primary election, and not for
other primaries or general elections.

   Delegates
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican presidential candidate George Bush
picked up 24 delegates in New York this week by virtue of his
opponents' failure to file delegate slates in eight of the state's
congressional districts.
   And successful challenges to non-Bush delegate slates in other
districts, if upheld by the courts, could leave the vice president
with at least two dozen other delegates running unopposed.
   The Board of Elections on Tuesday wiped two slates of delegates
supporting Bob Dole off the the April 19 primary ballot, one day
after stripping the Kansas senator's slate and one backing New York
Rep. Jack Kemp from the ballot.
   The petitions were rejected mainly because they did not contain
the required 1,250 signatures of registered Republicans, or were
signed by Republicans living outside the congressional district the
petitions were filed for.
   At stake in New York are 102 delegates, three from each
congressional district. The Republican state committee will
designate 34 other delegates after the primary.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Favorites In Early Quinnipiac College Poll </HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMDEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis emerged as the favorites in a
Quinnipiac College poll of Connecticut voters taken before the Iowa
caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the college said.
   The poll was based on telephone interviews between Jan. 25 and
Feb. 2 with 818 registered voters and showed that a large portion
was undecided on a favorite candidate for Connecticut's March 29
primary.
   The poll, the first of the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute
sampled, 256 Republicans, 316 Democrats and 212 unaffiliated
voters. It asked voters of each party which candidate they would
pick among those running in their party. Unaffiliated voters were
given a choice among candidates of both parties.
   Among the registered Republicans surveyed, 43.4 percent favored
Bush. Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas was in second place with 20.5
percent, while Rep. Jack Kemp of New York was third with 4.1
percent. The other Republican candidates polled less than 2
percent, while undecided Republicans totalled 25.4 percent.
   Of the Democrats polled, Dukakis had 32.6 percent of the vote,
followed by Gary Hart of Colorado with 13.4 percent and Jesse
Jackson of Illinois with 10.3 percent. Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois
had 4.8 percent, while none of the other candidates polled more
than 1.4 percent. Registered Democrats who said they were undecided
totalled 30.9 percent.
   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus five percentage
points, the college said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Group Pushes to Put Cuomo Name on California Ballot</HEAD>

   California backers of Mario Cuomo say
they have about half the 22,500 signatures they are seeking to try
to place the New York governor's name on California's June 7
Democratic presidential primary ballot.
   But state officials say that even if the draft-Cuomo committee
succeeds in collecting 22,500 verified signatures of California
voters by the March 24 deadline, they still won't add his name to
the ballot unless Cuomo authorizes the petition drive.
   ``The law and party rules make no provisions for unauthorized
slates (of delegates). Even if they get their signatures, we can't
place his name on the ballot,'' said secretary of state spokeswoman
Caren Daniels-Meade.
   ``You've got to have an official steering committee named by the
candidate. He has to be at least partially a willing participant,''
Daniels-Meade added.
   ``Our strategy all along has been to get the signatures and then
take her (California Secretary of State March Fong Eu) to court to
obtain an order placing the governor's name on the ballot,'' said
Los Angeles attorney Steven Polard, head of the California Draft
Cuomo for President Committee.

<HEAD>Soviet-Canadian Expedition Sets Out for North Pole</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE ARCTIC, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Canadians and nine Soviets set
off today on an icy, 1,073-mile ski journey over the North Pole,
from the northernmost point of the Soviet Union to Canada.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the cross-country skiers waved
goodbye to observers at Cape Arctic on the northern tip of
Severnaya Zemlya and headed north in single file. The expedition is
expected to take more than three months.
   Led by Dmitri Shparo, the group planned to make its way from
this northern extreme of the Soviet archipelago, known simply as
``Northern Land,'' across the pole and to Cape Columbia in the
Canadian Artic.
   The joint expedition was originally planned for 1980, but the
Canadians backed out when Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan's
civil war.
   Shparo, 46, led a Soviet polar ski trek in 1979, and the head of
the Canadian team, 28-year-old Richard Weber of Old Chesea,
Ontario, skied the Cape Columbia-North Pole segment in 1986. This
will be the first transcontinental ski trek.
   ``The most interesting part for me will be the social factor of
being in a very small tent with a large number of people for a very
long time,'' Weber told reporters who visited the ski team's
headquarters in Dickson, the Soviet Arctic Circle settlement that
is the northernmost city in the world.
   Canadian teammate Laurie Dexter, an Anglican minister from Fort
Smith, Northwest Territories, said the tent is about 15 feet square.
   ``There are inevitably frayed nerves and tensions, but all of us
are experienced enough and mature enough to let those things pass
and get on with the expedition,'' he said.
   Shparo said his biggest fears about the journey are thin ice at
the start and finish and encounters with open water caused by
drifting ice floes.
   ``Last time, Vasily had to swim twice, and the second time the
temperature was minus 30 degrees,'' Shparo said, referring to
Vasily Shishkarev, a member of the 1979 Soviet expedition and a
radio operator on this trek.
   The skiers will be equipped with rubber rafts, and the Soviets
will be carrying hunting rifles in case they run into dangerous
wildife.
   They plan to maintain radio contact with three polar weather
stations that can relay distress calls to Dickson. Should a medical
emergency develop, or an accident occur, an Aeroflot plane can be
summoned, weather permitting, Shparo said.
   The ski team includes two doctors, Max Buxton of Calabogie,
Ontario, and Mikhail Malakhov of Moscow.
   Malakhov is responsible for carrying out medical experiments on
his teammates to help doctors understand the effects of extreme
weather conditions on the human body.
   Yuri Khmelevsky, the chief researcher on the expedition, is
looking for a second magnetic pole.
   He explained in an interview at expedition headquarters that
strong magnetic pulls have been recorded by ships and planes in a
Soviet region below the pole.
   ``If it exists, we will find it on this trip,'' Khmelevsky said.
   The skiers will have supplies delivered to them by plane, but
their packs and equipment weigh up to 95 pounds when fully loaded.
   The expedition itinerary envisions five drops of food and
supplies.
   Other team members include Canadian scientist Chris Holloway,
Soviet cameraman Vladimir Ledenev, radio operator Anatoli Melnikov,
equipment manager Anatoly Fedyakov, photographer Alexander Belyayev
and artist Anatoly Fyodyakov.
   Most of the skiers are using Soviet-made wooden skis.

<TEXT>
   Well out of sight of tourists
strolling along the spectacular Royal Mile between Edinburgh's
medieval castle and Holyrood Palace, the Scottish capital is
grappling with a double epidemic of drug abuse and AIDS.
   The graceful old city, whose arts festival draws 600,000
visitors each summer, is becoming stigmatized as a European center
for drug-related AIDS.
   Unlike the rest of Britain, where drug addicts account for only
7 percent of AIDS carriers, needle-users make up 60 percent of the
infected population in Scotland and the majority live in Edinburgh.
The sharing of contaminated needles is one way that the AIDS virus
is transmitted.
   The number of full-blown AIDS cases in Scotland remains low _ 39
at the end of 1987 _ but 1,500 people in Edinburgh alone are
thought to be carrying the AIDS virus, an undetermined proportion
of whom will eventually die. The city of 440,000 inhabitants has
reported 824 confirmed AIDS carriers since mid-1983.
   Thirty-nine babies born in Edinburgh hospitals since 1985 had
AIDS antibodies, indicating their mothers were infected. It is not
known how many of the babies will develop AIDS.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's natural
immune system. Throughout most of Western Europe and the United
States, it has been confined largely to male homosexuals, although
it also affects hemophiliacs and intravenous drug users. About 25
percent of U.S. AIDS victims are intravenous drug users.
   In Edinburgh, AIDS is spread mainly through the sharing of
needles.
   Heroin smuggled through England's southern ports doubles in
price by the time it reaches this northern city and is so
adulterated that a dose becomes ineffective when inhaled or smoked.
   Edinburgh addicts, therefore, tend to inject drugs.
   ``There's a peculiar sort of Scottish characteristic here,''
explained Chief Inspector Douglas Kerr, Edinburgh's drug squad
chief. ``People didn't want to see themselves as being soft or
lacking guts. So anyone who failed to use heroin by injecting was
seen as copping out.''
   Also, needle-sharing ``is part of the scene in the same way that
a reefer is passed around at a party,'' he said. ``It's the social
thing.''
   Several specialists said a crackdown on drugs helped create a
needle shortage and may have quickened the spread of AIDS by
forcing more addicts to share.
   ``They're driving people, almost, into injecting,'' said Ray de
Souza, head of Simpson House, a drug rehabilitation center.
   But Kerr said experts were jumping to conclusions for want of
any other explanation for Edinburgh's predicament.
   With an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 drug abusers in Edinburgh, many
of them prostitutes, health officials are worried that AIDS will
spread into the general heterosexual population.
   ``It's the scale people are concerned about,'' said Carol
Skidmore, a psychologist with the Edinburgh Drug Addiction Study, a
research unit based at the West Granton Medical Group. She said the
infection rate among women due to sexual contact with male addicts
was 13 percent to 14 percent.
   An 11-doctor group in Muirhouse, a grim blue-collar district
known as ``Smack Alley,'' has 300 drug abusers among its 18,000
patients. Ms. Skidmore said 56 percent of the addicts are infected
with the AIDS virus _ and the clinic is having trouble coping with
them.
   Dr. George Bath, AIDS coordinator for the Lothian Health Board,
which is responsible for an area of 745,000 people in Edinburgh and
Lothian County, said the AIDS epidemic has created heavy demand for
screening and counseling.
   But so far, there's been minimal pressure on hospitals because
most of those carrying the virus are still well. ``The situation,''
he said in an interview, ``is the calm before the storm.''
   Drug abuse exploded in Scotland's inner cities in the early
1980s amid rising unemployment, social deprivation and plentiful
heroin. Edinburgh was hardest hit, although the industrial cities
of Glasgow and Dundee also experienced sharp rises in drug
trafficking.
   While Scottish officials cracked down on heroin, many addicts
simply switched to prescribed drugs, mainly painkillers and
tranquilizers, creating a new set of problems.
   ``We're finding that a lot of drug abusers are coming in to get
prescriptions for drugs because they're not able to get heroin,''
Ms. Skidmore said in an interview.
   ``They always want more than we're prepared to give. ... Really,
it's like a bottomless pit. You could just keep throwing
prescriptions at them and they would just keep using them.''
   Worse yet, she said, most addicts who switched from heroin were
taking prescription drugs in liquid form and still injecting them
despite the danger of AIDS.
   Last year, the government set up 15 pilot centers in British
cities, including Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee, where addicts can
swap old needles for new.
   Scottish Health Minister Michael Forsyth said in an interview
that he has extended government funding for the Scottish projects
through the end of March, but said preliminary results have been
disappointing. The Dundee clinic, for example, closed after only
six weeks.

<TEXT>
   A recovered alcoholic who was fired for
missing 389 days of work in three years has successfully sued his
federal employer for job discrimination because he didn't receive
legally mandated counseling.
   A federal judge ruled that Clarence Ferguson, 48, should be
allowed to re-apply for his job as a purchasing agent and ordered
the government to give him more than $150,000 in back pay.
   Ferguson said he didn't know he had a drinking problem until he
began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings regularly in 1984
after his dismissal from the National Wildlife Fisheries Service.
   A government worker for 20 years, Ferguson said he used to drink
a pint of gin daily. He doesn't drink now, he said.
   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich, in a ruling Tuesday,
cited a federal law requiring all federal agencies to ``make
reasonable accommodations'' for handicapped workers, including
those who are alcoholics and drug addicts.
   ``This is a very specific federal mandate that says the federal
government has to take certain steps that the private sector
doesn't have to,'' said Ferguson's lawyer, Roger Benson.
   Attorneys for the government argued they couldn't offer Ferguson
counseling before firing him because he never told them he was an
alcoholic. He never smelled of alcohol, never staggered and didn't
sneak drinks, they said during a non-jury trial last month.
   But Kovachevich ruled he was legally crippled by alcoholism and
that his employers should have helped him get counseling before
dismissing him. His absenteeism should have been a tipoff, she said.
   Attorneys for the Department of Commerce, which controls the
fisheries service, declined comment on whether they will appeal.
   The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments that could
legally define alcoholism as a disease and carry consequences for
the private sector.
   The nation's highest court agreed last October to hear a
challenge filed against the Veterans Administration for excluding
alcoholism from a list of illnesses and disabilities that veterans
can claim when seeking more time to apply for education benefits.
   The VA policy defines alcoholism as ``willful misconduct.''

   An 18-year-old man who shot and killed his
best friend during an argument over a pet ferret was sentenced to
four to five years in prison.
   Michael L. James, sentenced Wednesday in Douglas County District
Court, said he would always regret the shooting of David Klotz, 20.
   ``I'd like to say something to his parents that I haven't

   James shot Klotz in the head Sept. 6 at the apartment they
shared. Witnesses told police James threatened to kill a pet ferret
because it had fleas. Klotz protested and James shot him after a
struggle, authorities said.
   Judge Jerry Gitnick sentenced James to three to five years in
prison for manslaughter and to one additional year for using a
weapon in the commission of a felony.
   He originally was charged with second-degree murder but pleaded
guilty to the manslaughter and weapon charges.

   The government for the first time
offered to hold peace talks with Contra rebels inside Nicaragua and
recommended they be conducted without a go-between because past
mediation produced no results.
   President Daniel Ortega said Wednesday the talks should be held
March 10-12 in the Nicaraguan town of Sapoa near the Costa Rican
border. He also said his brother, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega,
would lead the Sandinista delegation.
   It was the first time the leftist Sandinista government proposed
negotiations in Nicaraguan territory with the U.S.-backed rebels,
and it would be the highest-level Sandinista delegation to meet
directly with the Contras.
   In Miami, the Contras had no immediate response to the proposal,
but a spokesman said today they viewed it with suspicion.
   ``We are following the situation closely and with concern,''
said Jorge Rosales, spokesman for the Nicaraguan Resistance,
umbrella organization for rebel groups. ``We have to have
first-hand information.''
   ``The Sandinistas have violated the peace accords and don't
honor their own signature,'' he said.
   Nicaragua previously demanded that the rebels accept a
government amnesty as a condition for meeting inside Nicaragua.
Until now, the highest-ranking Sandinista negotiator has been a
deputy foreign minister.
   Ortega made the announcement after meeting for 20 minutes with
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who mediated two rounds of
cease-fire talks with the Contras.
   The last round of negotiations broke off Feb. 19 in Guatemala
after the cardinal declared an impasse. The first meeting, in Costa
Rica, was noted both for its cordial atmosphere and lack of
progress.
   Ortega said he decided ``to take the bull by the horns'' because
Obando y Bravo's efforts to halt the 7-year-old war had produced no
results.
   Erick Ramirez, leader of the opposition Social Christian Party
in Managua, said the cardinal's dismissal ``will mean an increase
in war and violence ... because the cardinal had the confidence of
the people.''
   ``I expressed to Cardinal Obando my concern over time passing by
and that, as he himself had said, we must take the bull by the
horns and that a direct contact at the highest level and here in
Nicaragua would be very important because it would make the job of
the mediator unnecessary,'' Ortega said.
   The peace talks are being conducted under a Central American
peace plan signed last August by the presidents of Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras.
   Ortega publicly thanked Obando y Bravo for his efforts, adding:
``We would not have reached this decisive moment where we will put
to the test the will to work for a cease-fire if we had not had his
contribution in this first phase when there was no direct contact
with the counterrevolution and when the role of the mediator was
necessary and indispensable.''
   ``I hope they can find peace now, even if I am not there anymore
as mediator,'' Obando y Bravo told The Associated Press a few hours
later. ``I have often said that a mediator is necessary when both
parties want him. I hope they find peace and put an end to the war,
the suffering.''
   ``We worked a lot. There were many problems at first. They (the
government) refused to meet in Central America first, then they
did; then they had refused to meet in Nicaragua, now they are
proposing it,'' the cardinal said.
   Ortega said: ``They (the Contras) cannot have any excuse now.
They themselves have requested the highest level talks possible and
in Nicaragua. This is a delegation of the highest level.''
   Before Wednesday, Ortega had insisted the Contras seek a
government amnesty forcing them to pledge to stop fightingbefore
they would be allowed into the country to hold cease-fire talks.
   Obando y Bravo sent a letter to Ortega earlier Wednesday calling
for a resumption in truce talks. Ortega left him a letter in reply,
outlining his decision proposing new negotiations without a
mediator.
   The cardinal said he had read the letter to leaders of the
Nicaraguan Resistance.
   The regional peace plan calls for cease-fires in civil wars in
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala; as well as amnesties, greater
democracy, the end of using a country's territory to launch attacks
on a neighbor and a halt to outside aid to insurgents in the region.

<HEAD>Dean Says Resignation Voluntary After Slaying In His Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A university dean has confirmed that a
man accused of a slaying in his home is his former lover, but says
he was not pressured into resigning because of the scandal over the
killing.
   Timothy J. Lyons, dean of Youngstown State University's College
of Fine and Performing Arts, on Wednesday confirmed a police
affidavit that identified the defendant as his former lover.
   Brian Scott Blevins, 22, of Boardman, is charged with murder in
the Feb. 12 death of Kenmore B. Drake. Blevins is in jail in lieu
of $250,000 bond.
   Drake, 21, was staying at Lyons' home while Lyons was in
California visiting his daughters. Lyons said he and Drake were
friends, not lovers.
   ``It is essential to the police case to establish my
homosexuality, that Scott Blevins and I lived as lovers,'' Lyons,
43, told reporters Wednesday. ``I don't resent that people know
something is true. I have a problem with the way people react. ...
My homosexuality is so damned irrelevant to my profession.''
   Youngstown State officials announced Tuesday that Lyons would
leave his post Monday because of ``difficulties'' resulting from
Drake's death. University officials have not commented on the
situation, other than to issue Lyons' resignation statement.
   Drake, a Youngstown State senior, was stabbed about 50 times
with a pair of scissors, the Mahoning County coroner's office says.
Blevins was not a university student.
   Lyons said he persuaded the university's board of trustees to
consider his resignation and that he wasn't pressured to quit.
   Lyons said he's upset that people are allowing his homosexuality
to overshadow the fact that ``a good man is dead.''
   Lyons said he planned to leave the area after his testimony if
the case goes to trial. He said he didn't know if he would stay in
academics.
   Lyons is to be paid his salary, $59,000 a year, through Dec. 31.
He joined Youngstown State as dean in 1985.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, resuming
Mideast peacemaking efforts, said today the Reagan administration
remains opposed to bringing the Palestine Liberation Organization
into negotiations.
   Shultz arrived in London for two hours of talks with King
Hussein of Jordan. Before leaving NATO headquarters in Brussels, he
told reporters, ``The current U.S. policy toward the PLO is the
same as it has been for years.
   ``We don't talk to the PLO or deal with them as long as they do
not ... basically state their readiness to deal with the state of
Israel as a fact of life that's going to be there,'' Shultz said,
``and as long as they don't renounce terrorism and violence. Those
are the conditions.''
   Hussein has reportedly been in London for dental surgery.
   The secretary, who was to travel to Jersualem after seeing
Hussein, said that any Arab-Israeli settlement must ``deal with the
legitimate rights'' of the Palestinians. Shultz said he did not
expect, during his return trip to the Middle East, to meet with
Palestinian leaders in the Israeli occupied lands.
   ``I don't see any way to do that, but of course I would like to
do that as soon as possible,'' he said.
   President Reagan announced Wednesday that he was sending Shultz
on a new round of talks with Mideast leaders in search of a formula
for negotiations to end the 40-year Arab-Israeli dispute.
   On Friday, in a fast-paced sequence, he will meet separately
with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres, go to Egypt and Syria for talks with leaders there _
and immediately fly home.
   His hope is that he can narrow the differences over who should
be at the negotiating table and over the outline of an eventual
settlement.
   Hussein and Syrian President Hafez Assad are pushing hard for
participation by the Soviet Union and the Palestine Liberation
Organization. Shamir, meanwhile, is resisting the U.S. call on
Israel to exchange territory for peace with the Arabs.
   Reagan made the decision to recommit Shultz and U.S. prestige to
the so-far unsuccessful search for peace after Shultz reported on
his first, four-day meeting the Arabs and Israelis.
   ``It is clear all countries in the region believe it is useful
for the United States to remain engaged in this process,'' Reagan
said. ``We will spare no effort in our search for a comprehensive
peace settlement.''
   Shultz, interviewed on ``CBS Morning News'' today, said that
since he consulted here with Reagan, ``I feel as though I have
something to say that comes from the president, and my discussions
with him, and I'll go around and say it.''
   The idea _ which so far Hussein and Shamir have not accepted _
is to quickly defuse the disturbances on the West Bank and in Gaza
with a two-step plan.
   First, arrangements would be made to transfer immediately to the
1.5 million Palestinians in the Israeli-held territories control
over their daily affairs.
   Then, by December, Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians would
meet on an overall settlement of the Middle East conflict.
   Hussein is insisting on an active role by the Soviet Union in
shaping a settlement and the direct participation of the PLO, which
is accused by Israel and the United States of fomenting terrorism.
   He is also demanding the withdrawal of Israel from all the land
the Arabs lost in the 1967 Six-Day war.
   Shamir has offered autonomy for the Palestinians and is trying
to fence out the Soviets, who do not have diplomatic ties with
Jerusalem. He has resisted yielding territory.
   Shamir said in Jerusalem on Wednesday that Shultz ``is making a
laudable attempt to move the peace process forward and get
negotiations started between us and Jordan.''
   But he told members of the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations that Israeli withdrawal from occupied
lands would have ``disastrous consequences,'' arguing the ultimate
goal of Arab leaders was to destroy Israel.
   A U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said Hussein did not
``throw cold water'' on the U.S. initiative but also did not
endorse it.
   ``If I had to describe the situation, I would say that nobody
has signed up to our proposals, but everybody wants us to keep
working,'' Shultz said Tuesday in Tel Aviv.
   Asked during the CBS interview about Palestinian participation
in any peace talks, Shultz said that Hussein has said that
Palestinians must be present ``so they can speak'' and said the
Israelis ``fully agree with this.''
   Shultz said ``the king's idea is that they be part of a
Jordanian-Palestinian delegations.''

<HEAD>Mistrial in Reverse Bias Case Declared After Former Police Chief
Admits Lying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mistrial was declared in a reverse
discrimination case of four white police officers after Chicago's
former head of police admitted he lied under oath.
   U.S. District Judge Paul E. Plunkett declared the mistrial
Wednesday in the $12 million lawsuit, in which four officers say
they were demoted because of their race and for political reasons.
The judge said former Police Superintendent Fred Rice's admission
and reasons he cited for lying tainted the jury and undercut the
case.
   Matthew Piers, an assistant corporation counsel for the city who
represented Rice, said it was ``ridiculous'' when asked if Rice
could face perjury charges. ``It is not a possibility at all,''
Piers said.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas would not comment.
   Piers had argued against a mistrial, telling the judge that
Rice's admission harmed no one but himself. ``A mistrial is a gross
injustice to the defendant's case,'' he said.
   But Plunkett did not agree. He said he would rule April 13 on a
request for a default judgment in favor of the four officers.
   A few months after the 1983 election of Harold Washington, the
city's first black mayor, Rice was named as the first black police
superintendent, and 25 white officers were demoted.
   Four officers are seeking $12 million from the city, maintaining
they were demoted because they are white and because they supported
Washington's Democratic primary opponent, former Mayor Jane Byrne.
   Rice said politics had no part in any reassignments during his
years as police superintendent.
   In court Tuesday, Rice said he concealed his real reasons for
demoting a number of ranking white officers to protect their
reputations and preserve police morale. He said ``negative
information'' was a factor in the demotions.
   Rice, 61, said he lied in depositions taken in October 1984 and
August 1985 when he was still superintendent. He retired last year.
   Rice's unexpected admission brought an angry response from
Edward Theobald, attorney for the plaintiffs, one current and three
former officers.
   ``You know it's a felony crime, and you deliberately lied when
you were sworn to tell the truth,'' Theobald contended.
   ``That's right,'' said Rice, who said ``there were extenuating
circumstances that caused me to say the things I did.''
   ``I tried to be as considerate to those people as possible,''
the former police chief said. ``I felt I was protecting the
reputation of all the people I reduced.''
   Theobald requested the mistrial and asked Plunkett for a default
judgment.
   In a telephone interview late Wednesday, Theobald said that if
the judge rules in the officers' favor, a jury would be chosen to
set damages. If Plunkett denies the default judgment, a new trial
would begin.

   Lt. Col. William Higgins, the American Marine
kidnapped in Lebanon two weeks ago, has been selected for promotion
to the rank of colonel.
   Higgins, a military aide to former Defense Secretary Caspar W.
Weinberger before assuming a temporary assignment as the head of a
United Nations observer detachment last summer, was listed today
along with 78 other lieutenant colonels selected by a promotion
board for advancement.
   Higgins is No. 28 on the list of 79 and would not actually
receive the new rank for another year at the earliest. The Marine
promotion board was formed early this year to screen a field of 165
men and women. Higgins was kidnapped on Feb. 17.
   Higgins, 43, was in Lebanon because he had been assigned to
temporary duty with the United Nations heading a group of observers
attached to the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization.
   A decorated Vietnam combat veteran, Higgins served as the junior
military assistant to Weinberger for two years, from June 1985 to
June 1987.

   A drunken argument between two men over the

   ``It appears the men were drinking all day and they began to

   Purvis said the shooting occurred at the uncle's home.

   Philip Henry Alston Jr., a confidant of former
President Jimmy Carter and former ambassador to Australia, has
died. He was 76.
   Alston died Wednesday after a short illness.
   An influential Atlanta lawyer, Alston raised millions of dollars
for the University of Georgia and began supporting Carter
politically after meeting him in 1966.
   Carter lost the governor's race that year to Lester Maddox, but
Alston was chairman of Carter's successful gubernatorial bid in
1970. He was chairman of the Committee for Jimmy Carter when Carter
was elected president in 1976.
   As president, Carter appointed Alston ambassador to Australia.
   Survivors include his wife, a son, a daughter and five
grandchildren.

   The mother of U.S. Sen. Richard G. Lugar was
reported missing early today by relatives, but she was found
unharmed in Illinois by mid-morning, according to a spokesman for
the senator.
   ``We assume that she was driving around and got disoriented,''
Andy Fisher, an aide to the Indiana Republican, said from
Washington.
   Bertha Lugar Caldwell, 81, may have gotten disoriented while
driving late Wednesday in Indianapolis, which is about 70 miles
from the Illinois state line, Fisher said.
   Fisher would not specify where Mrs. Caldwell was but said she
was OK and at a hotel. Relatives were en route.
   ``There was no foul play involved,'' said Wendy Snitko of the
Indianapolis Police Department.
   Fisher said a doctor probably would examine Mrs. Caldwell in
Indianapolis but that her health ``has been fine all along.''
   ``It is one of these things that happens from time to time with
older people. She may have gotten disoriented.''
   Mrs. Caldwell was reported missing about 1:30 a.m. today by her
stepdaughter, Lynn Caldwell.
   She had last been seen Wednesday night driving in the city's
northside.
   Sally Lugar, wife of the senator's brother Thomas, said she
received a call late Wednesday from a friend who said she had seen
Mrs. Caldwell driving her car at the Christian Theological Seminary.
   ``With the weather, we were a little concerned,'' Mrs. Lugar
said. ``I called at her home. When I didn't get an answer, I went
over. It's been a long night.''
   There was rain, freezing rain and sleet in the area during the
night.

   Wrapped in a clear plastic sheet to ward
off drizzle, Jacqueline Smith today sat on a sidewalk and protested
plans to make a civil rights museum out of the small motel where
Martin Luther King Jr. was killed.
   Ms. Smith, who was forcibly evicted Wednesday from The Lorraine
Motel, said she would stay in front of the motel as long as she
could.
   ``I don't mind being a little uncomfortable,'' she said. ``I'll
try to sit here as long as my body allows.''
   Ms. Smith said several friends dropped by during the night to
offer food and encouragement and two supporters took turns sitting
with her until daybreak.
   She was carried from the motel by Shelby County sheriff's
deputies who deposited her just outside an 8-foot chain-link
surrounding The Lorraine, which was closed last month to make way
for an $8.8 million museum.
   ``You people are making a mistake. You people are making a
mistake,'' Ms. Smith sobbed as the deputies evicted her.
   The Lorraine was closed Jan. 11, but Ms. Smith ignored repeated
requests to move from her room, about 25 feet from where King was
felled by an assassin's rifle slug.
   Ms. Smith, who has lived and worked at The Lorraine for 11
years, argued that the motel should be turned into shelter for the
homeless, not a museum. She argued a museum will speed efforts to
gentrify her low-income neighborhood.
   The Lorraine, which has fallen into disrepair over the years,
was bought at a foreclosure auction in 1982 by a group pushing
plans for a museum.
   The state has appropriated $4.4 million for the project and city
and county governments have agreed to match that. The state has
title to the property and will build and operate the museum,
scheduled to open in 1991.
   King was in Memphis to help organize a strike by city sanitation
workers. James Earl Ray, a prison escapee from Missouri, pleaded
guilty to the killing and is serving a 99-year sentence at the
Southeast Tennessee Regional Prison near Pikeville.

   West German hostage Ralph Rudolf Schray
was freed by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers in Beirut
today and turned over to the West German embassy in Damascus,
officials said.
   An embassy employee in Damascus, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he saw Schray being escorted into the embassy at
around noon. The 30-year-old industrial engineer was kidnapped Jan.
27 and released before dawn.
   ``He is still inside, resting and waiting for his wife,'' the
employee said. ``A car has been sent to Beirut to bring her.''
   A military source at the Syrian command in Beirut, also speaking
on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that Schray
was driven to the Syrian capital, 56 miles east of Beirut, under
heavy Syrian escort.
   In a statement issued in Bonn, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher thanked the Syrian government for its help. A ministry
statement said Schray was in good physical condition.
   Schray, a Lebanese-born West German, was seized in Moslem west
Beirut. A Shiite faction, Holy Warriors for Freedom, on Wednesday
claimed responsibility for his abduction.
   The group also claimed responsibility for kidnapping two other
West Germans in Beirut in January 1987. It is believed headed by
the brother of two Lebanese Shiite Moslems who are being held in
West Germany on terrorism and kidnapping charges.
   Schray's mother, Fahima Schray, called her son's captivity ``the
most terrible days of my life. It was so difficult.'' Mrs. Schray
was interviewed in Fort Myers, Fla.
   ``I couldn't sleep last night one minute. This morning,
everything has changed completely, as if I'm a new woman,'' she
said.
   Schray's Lebanese wife of six months, Rana Mounla, and his
uncle, George abu Nassar, left by car for Damascus carrying a
suitcase of clothes for the freed German.
   ``I'm going to see him,'' a beaming Mrs. Schray told reporters.
``I'm taking clothes for him.''
   She indicated that she planned to return to Beirut with her
husband from Damascus. ``When we're back together in Beirut
tomorrow we'll both talk to you,'' she said. She declined to
elaborate.
   Abu Nassar, a wealthy Lebanese businessman of Palestinian
descent, refused to talk to reporters.
   There are still 22 foreigners missing after being kidnapped in
Lebanon. They include nine Americans, four Frenchmen, three
Britons, a West German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two
unidentified men.
   Longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   The Holy Warriors for Freedom made its claim in a typewritten
Arabic statement released to the Reuters news agency in Beirut. It
was accompanied by a recent snapshot of Schray.
   The statement said Schray could be released within hours as a
result of mediation by Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   Abdul-Hadi Hamadi is reputed to lead the Holy Warriors for
Freedom, and he also heads the security apparatus of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Hamadi's brother, Abbas Hamadi, is on trial in West Germany on
charges of kidnapping West Germans Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt
in January 1987 in Beirut.
   Those kidnappings allegedly were to pressure the Bonn government
into releasing a third Hamadi brother, Mohammed, who is being held
in Frankfurt on terrorism charges.
   In their statement Wednesday, the kidnappers said that while
they were negotiating with the West Germans over Schray, ``a
mediation team from the brothers in Syria, led by President Assad,
gave a chance for a new round of commitments that made the case of
the German Schray head for a solution within the coming hours.''
   ``The Hamadi brothers are still in Germany. The release (of
Schray) is goodwill gesture No. 2,'' it added.
   Schmidt, 47, was released Sept. 7 as a goodwill gesture. Cordes,
53, is still in captivity.
   Mohammed Hamadi has been indicted in the United States on murder
and air piracy charges in connection with the June 1985 hijacking
of a TWA jetliner in which 39 Americans were held hostage and a
U.S. Navy diver was killed.
   He was arrested Jan. 13, 1987 when he arrived at Frankfurt
airport carrying explosives. The Bonn government last year turned
down a U.S. request for his extradition, saying he will be tried in
West Germany on similar charges.
   Cordes was kidnapped in Beirut on Jan. 17, 1987, and Schmidt

   Abbas Hamadi was arrested also upon arriving at Frankfurt

   The mother of a West German industrial
engineer freed early today after being kidnapped in Lebanon five
weeks ago said the news ended the ``most terrible days of my life.''
   Farina Schray said she was waiting for word from her only child,
30-year-old Ralph Rudolf Schray, who was abducted Jan. 27 in Moslem
west Beirut.
   Schray was freed unharmed before dawn today by Shiite Moslem
kidnappers and taken to Damascus. He was reported in good physical
condition.
   ``It was so difficult,'' said Ms. Schray, who is visiting her
son's uncle. ``We were praying all the time. ... It was the most
terrible days of my life.''
   Ms. Schray said that during the ordeal she has maintained
contact with her son's wife of six months, Rana Mounla.
   Ms. Schray said she wasn't sure how long she will stay in
Florida or if her son will come here. If he doesn't, she will
probably return to her Beirut home in a week or so, she said.
   The Syrian government was credited with mediating the release of
Schray, a Lebanese-born West German. Since March 1985, 22
foreigners have been kidnapped in Lebanon, including nine
Americans, four Frenchmen, three Britons, a West German, an
Italian, an Irishman and Indian and two unidentified men.
   Longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>Delta Witness Says Meteorologist Was Negligent in Jet Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A meteorologist says it would have made
``all the difference in the world'' if National Weather Service
forecasters had passed along information about a thunderstorm that
downed Delta Airlines Flight 191.
   William Haggard also criticized a weather service meteorologist
assigned to monitor weather near Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport for going to dinner 40 minutes before the crash.
   Flight 191 crashed Aug. 2, 1985, while attempting to land at
Dallas-Fort Worth during a severe thunderstorm, killing 137 people
and injuring 25 others.
   Delta is suing the government, claiming the failure of weather
service employees and air traffic controllers to warn the flight
crew of the storm was a primary cause of the crash.
   The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the
crash was caused in part by the pilot's decision to fly into an
area of potential wind shear, a violent downdraft of air beneath
thunderstorms.
   The L-1011 widebody jet was hit by such a downdraft while
approaching the runway, and slammed into airport water tanks and
exploded into flames.
   Haggard, who owns a private meteorological consulting firm in
North Carolina, said Wednesday that government meteorologist
Richard Douglass should not have left his post for more than 10
minutes on the evening of the crash because conditions suggested
dangerous weather might be ahead.
   ``I think all the difference in the world would have been made
if he (Douglass) had been there and been alert,'' Haggard said.
``He would have had the opportunity to call the (control) tower and
warn them.''
   Justice Department attorney Kathlynn Fadely has argued that the
Delta flight crew knew of the thunderstorm in its landing path when
co-pilot Rudolph Price spotted lightning about 1{ minutes before
the crash.
   Haggard testified that while Douglass was at dinner, a second
forecaster stationed at Stephenville, southwest of Fort Worth,
spotted signs of a storm but telephoned his warning to the weather
service in Fort Worth instead of the airport control tower. He said
weather service officials failed to relay that warning in the
minutes before the crash.
   The non-jury trial will determine whether the government must
pay part of $91.2 million in claims that Delta's insurers have paid
so far in connection with the crash.

   The Senate voted overwhelmingly today to
prohibit most employers from using lie detectors to screen job
applicants and randomly test the honesty of employees.
   On a 69-27 vote, the Senate passed a bill by senators Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah _ normally adversaries on
labor-management issues _ over the objections of a small group of
conservative Republicans.
   A similar but more stringent ban was approved last November by
the House. Differences between the two versions must be resolved
and a compromise passed by both houses.
   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., a leader of the opposition, predicted
that President Reagan would sign a polygraph bill despite a vow by
administration officials last year that they would encourage him to
veto it.
   ``The administration does not have the backbone at this time to
veto this bill,'' Quayle complained. ``They have folded up shop,
caving like a house of cards.''
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., another opponent, predicted that
denying employers the opportunity to screen job applicants using
polygraph examinations will raise consumer costs through increased
thefts on the job.
   Kennedy and Hatch, however, said no one has presented any
statistics in states where use of the test already is prohibited to
demonstrate a higher incidence of theft or embezzlement.
   Hatch called the softening of the administration's opposition
``encouraging.''
   ``Some 320,000 honest Americans are branded as liars every
single year because of these devices,'' he said. ``That's a stigma
they are going to have to wear every day the rest of their lives
and careers.''
   Kenneday said the polygraph has become ``to the 20th century
what witchcraft was two centuries ago.''
   ``We're going to see the day where the average worker is going
to be able to walk into the workplace with dignity and
self-respect,'' he said. ``These devices are no longer going to
scar people in ways that they and their families can never forget.''
   The Senate voted after Quayle, Cochran and Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, dropped plans to introduce three more amendments aimed at
weakening the ban.
   The House version would ban all use of polygraph examinations in
private industry except for security personnel and pharmaceutical
companies.
   While imposing the same prohibitions on lie detectors to screen
job applicants, the Senate measure would allow their use to
investigate incidents of ``economic loss or injury'' such as
alleged thefts or other criminal acts, but only under strict
regulations to be enforced by the Labor Department.
   Hatch said the compromise acceptable to many retailers and other
companies plagued by thefts was formulated primarily by leaders of
the 1-million-member United Food and Commercial Workers Union.
   ``Honest people each year are branded as liars,'' Hatch said,
because of false results from polygraph tests often administered in
15 minutes and in ways that minimize their accuracy.
   ``Conversely,'' he said, ``it is a regrettable fact that
employees steal. This bill addresses both concerns by barring use
of polygraphs where they are most likely to make a false
identification but permitting the use of these tests where they are
likely to be most accurate ... in conjunction with the
investigation of a specific incident.''
   Before any test, employers would first have to file a police
report, insurance claim or report to a regulatory agency _ or sign
a statement detailing their reasons for testing a specific worker.
   And the tests would have to be administered under strict
guidelines to be developed by the Labor Department requiring at
least 90 minutes for each exam.
   Violations could result in fines of up to $10,000 each, and
employees or job applicants would have the right to file civil
suits against offenders.
   Disciplining or firing employees for refusing to take the test
or for failing it without additional supporting evidence of
wrongdoing would be prohibited.
   Administration officials have said they would urge President
Reagan to veto the House version as an unwarranted federal
intrusion into labor-management relations and pre-emption of state
regulations.
   The administration also has gone on record opposing the Senate
measure but not in as strong terms.
   Kennedy, citing reports from the congressional Office of
Technology Assessment and the American Medical Association that the
tests give false results 15 percent to 50 percent of the time,
called lie detectors ``inaccurate instruments of intimidation.''
   ``We know that in most applications, the devices cannot be
trusted,'' he said. ``It is time to put an end to their
unacceptable misuse that unfairly places so many workers' jobs in
jeopardy.''
   The legislation was prompted by an explosive growth _ ``like
wildfire,'' according to Kennedy _ in the use of lie detector tests
by employers over the past eight years.
   An estimated 2 million people are now subjected to the tests
each year, double the number just three years ago, according to
Kennedy. He and Hatch estimated their bill would outlaw about 85
percent of those tests.
   Like the House, the Senate voted Wednesday to also exempt
security guards, armored car companies and firms that install and
service security alarms from the prohibition.
   And it extended the House exemption to include workers at
nuclear power plants and contract employees hired by the government
with access to classified information.
   However, it rejected several other amendments aimed at weakening
the ban, such as allowing the tests if employees request them and
exemptions for airline, railroad and other employees in the
transportation industry.

<TEXT>
   A woman located through income tax errors
has pleaded guilty to escaping from a federal women's prison 10
years ago, but even a prosecutor cites her good behavior since then.
   Mary Hughey Cantrell, who failed to return from a 1977 Christmas
furlough, pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court in Beckley to a
charge of escape from the Alderson Federal Correctional
Institution. She was returned to the prison to await her April 22
sentencing.
   The charge carries a maximum five-year sentence and a $5,000
fine.
   Federal public defender Ira Kirkendoll said Cantrell, 40,
originally from North Carolina, moved to Arizona shortly after her
escape and apparently remained law-abiding while working for
several years as a maid in private homes and resorts.
   ``It's pretty unusual, the length of time,'' Kirkendoll said.
``Apparently she has reformed to some degree.''
   Even Assistant U.S. Attorney Kirk Brandfass said the woman's
decade of crime-free living, aside from maintaining a false
identity, should be considered at sentencing.
   ``My heavens, that ought to count for something,'' Brandfass
said outside court.
   U.S. marshals wouldn't allow an interview with Cantrell, who had
been sentenced to three years after a 1975 conviction for passing
counterfeit money.
   She was paroled in May 1976 but was returned to the Alderson
prison in early 1977 after a parole violation, and has about 470
days left to serve on her original sentence.
   She was arrested Jan. 5 in Phoenix, Ariz.
   During her 10 years of freedom, Cantrell acquired an
acquaintance's identification cards. She was discovered after the
Internal Revenue Service spotted a discrepancy in income tax
returns for a woman who had never worked in Arizona.
   ``Then it was a matter of running the paychecks back to where
they were earned,'' Brandfass said. ``And it zeroed in at Phoenix,
Ariz. I'm told she was pretty stunned when the marshals showed up
to get her.''

<HEAD>Bennett Renews Call for Sexual Abstinence Among Teen-Agers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary William J. Bennett today
renewed his call for sexual abstinence among teen-agers as their
best defense against AIDS, and said he and Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop are not as far apart on the issue as perceived.
   Bennett was responding to a statement by retired Adm. James D.
Watkins, chairman of President Reagan's AIDS commission, that one
of the panel's main tasks is to resolve seemingly differing
opinions in making its recommendations this summer.
   Commenting on publicized differences between Bennett and Koop
over what emphasis to place on urging sexually active people to use
condoms, Watkins said, ``Whether it is real or non-substantive, it
is a real perception out there.''
   Watkins said many witnesses have told the commission they fear
top federal officials are sending ``equivocal messages'' to the
nation on AIDS prevention and that it is important for the federal
government to speak with one voice on the issue.
   ``Dr. Koop and I are very close, extremely close,'' said
Bennett. `'I think Koop and I agree 95 percent of the way. It's all
right for the surgeon general and the secretary of education to
speak a little differently about these things.''
   He compared it to a young woman or man who might discuss ``what
he or she is doing'' with a doctor with a counselor.
   ``The doctor's advice would probably emphasize the medical
aspects, as it should,'' said Bennett. ``The teacher or counselor's
advice might emphasize other things. Some shading of difference is
OK. Some measure of disagreement is OK.''
   ``When the American people ask for leadership, they are not
saying, `we're a bunch of dummies, tell us what to think','' said
Bennett, ``They want to know our best thinking. And if our best
thinking diverges on some points, they can handle it.''
   Although saying he agrees that people, including teen-agers,
need to know that condom and spermicide use offers the only
protection against contracting AIDS sexually, Bennett said it was a
matter of emphasis.
   What he fears, he said, is teachers going through ``a kind of
incantation'' on abstinence and sexual monogamy in AIDS prevention
classes, ``then proceeding for the rest of the class to talk (to
teen-agers) about how to protect themselves.''
   ``It's like saying, don't smoke, but if you do, smoke low tar.
Don't drink, but if you do, keep it to 70 proof. I think these are
equivocal messages.''
   Koop told the White House AIDS commission earlier in the week
that while it is important to recommend abstinence, ``I think it is
also realistic to understand that sexually active teen-agers are
unlikely to reverse their pattern and go backward, and therefore
prevention for them has to be our third line of defense. ... We
have to teach them about the protection of themselves and others
through the use of condoms and spermicides.''

<TEXT>
   A former football star who now is a
college athletic director has been charged with first-degree murder
in the 31-year-old slaying of a reputed whiskey runner, police said.
   Bobby Hoppe, 53, of Ringgold, Ga., and athletic director at
Chattanooga State Technical Community College, was arrested
Wednesday after a Hamilton County grand jury indicted him for the
1957 shotgun death of Teddy Donald Hudson in North Chattanooga.
   Hoppe's arrest followed a 14-month investigation by two
Chattanooga detectives who interviewed at least 45 witnesses after
reopening the case, police said.
   Hoppe was a suspect in the original 1957 investigation, said
police spokesman Freeman Cooper.
   ``Allegations were made during that investigation that Hoppe had
shot Hudson over his (Hoppe's) sister, whom Hudson was dating at
the time,'' Cooper read from a statement. ``However, police could
not develop enough evidence to arrest him.''
   After Hudson, 24, was shot to death in a car near his home,
police investigated the possibility that the slaying was related to
the moonshine liquor business, for which Hudson had served time
previously.
   The investigation was reopened after Hudson's mother, Georgia,
talked with detectives following a meeting of Families and Friends
of Murder Victims, a support and counseling group.
   At the time of the slaying, Hoppe was a starter on the Alabama
Polytechnic Institute, now Auburn University, football team that
went on to win a national championship. Before that, he was an
all-state player at Chattanooga's Central High School.
   Hoppe, who was released after posting $7,000 bond, said
Wednesday: ``My attorney has told me not to make a statement. ... I
am not going to answer more questions.''

<TEXT>
   Many shuttered stores reopened today
and opponents of the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega pondered
their next move as a general strike wound down.
   President Reagan indicated today he believes Noriega must go.
Secretary of State George P. Shultz said economic sanctions against
Noriega's government were being ``considered carefully.''
   Local banks, closed since the strike began Monday, were to
reopen at midday. At least two factories in the city's main
industrial park _ a ghost town for the past three days _ resumed
work this morning, with others preparing to do so.
   Anti-riot police made a show of force early today along Calle
50, the scene of disturbances Tuesday and Wednesday. At least three
truckloads of the troopers _ whose corps is called the
``Dobermans'' _ took up positions at strategic intersections.
   Leaders of the National Civic Crusade said they would decide
tonight whether to call off the strike, which has lasted longer
than any of the five shutdowns staged last year by the opposition
coalition.
   A member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, meanwhile, was quoted by
a Panama City newspaper as denying reports that Noriega was purging
his armed forces.
   National assemblyman Guillermo Cochez, of the opposition
Christian Democratic Party, said Wednesday at a news conference
that Noriega had ordered the early retirements of two colonels and
two majors he suspected of wavering loyalty.
   But Joint Chiefs member Col. Leonidas Macias told the
pro-government newspaper ``La Estrella'' that ``here everything is
normal and no one has been retired or dismissed.''
   On Wednesday, organizers called the strike their most successful
yet. The United States also stepped up economic pressure on
Panama's military strongman.
   Doctors on Wednesday joined businesses in the strike. Organizers
said they would increase street demonstrations that have brought
scattered violence to the capital.
   Reagan was asked in Brussels, where he attended a NATO summit,
if he thought Noriega should relinquish power.
   ``Yes,'' the president responded. He did not elaborate.
   Shultz called Noriega ``bad news'' but said that no decision had
been made on sanctions.
   Noriega, chief of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces, has run the
country since 1983. He was indicted in the United States last month
on charges of trafficking in cocaine.
   In June, his former second-in-command went public with charges
that Noriega was involved in election fraud, corruption and
political assassinations. Noriega has denied those accusations.
   In Washington, U.S. officials confirmed Wednesday that they will
ask U.S. banks to freeze Panamanian government assets and delay
payment of Panama Canal tolls to the military-dominated government.
   Panama is thought to have up to $50 million on deposit in seven
U.S. banks and its share of canal fees comes to about $7 million a
month.
   The sanctions were recommended by William D. Rogers, whose
Washington law firm represents Panama's deposed president, Eric
Arturo Delvalle.
   The U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
State Department was acting on the Rogers recommendations because
it recognizes Delvalle as Panama's lawful head of state.
   Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for Latin American
affairs, told Cable News Network in Washington that the State
Department would advise American bankers to withhold funds from the
Panamanian government.
   ``Delvalle is president of Panama. And Noriega has been fired
and he does not have legitimate authority here,'' he said.
   Manuel Solis Palma, installed as Panama's new chief of state,
said Wednesday that he had no official knowledge of the U.S. plan.
   Delvalle attempted to fire Noriega last week, prompting the
Noriega-controlled National Assembly to remove him. Delvalle went
into hiding, apparently in Panama.
   Strike organizers claimed ship traffic through the Panama Canal
was halted for an hour Wednesday by Panamanian workers.
   The Panama Canal Commission said traffic was normal. The
commission also said it received two phony bomb threats Wednesday
and Tuesday, adding that they had not disrupted operation of the
waterway.

   Negotiators in the U.N.-sponsored Afghanistan
peace talks agreed today that the Soviet Union should withdraw its
115,000 soldiers from the country within nine months.
   Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil announced the agreement and
told reporters that half the troops would leave within the first
three months.
   Wakil said the accord was reached during 2{ hours of meetings
that U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez conducted separately today with
Afghan and Pakistani representatives.
   ``Nothing important stands in the way of concluding a
settlement,'' Wakil said. The accord on the timetable had been
expected after the gap between the two sides' positions had
narrowed from an original 43 months to two months in almost six
years of negotiations.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev last month had said Moscow would
bring home its troops within 10 months starting May 15 provided a
settlement is signed in Geneva by March 15.
   Cordovez planned to brief U.S. and Soviet officials later,
including Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Robert Peck, sources said.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in 1979 and replaced the
communist government with another communist regime. They have been
helping the government fight anti-communist Moslem guerrillas.
   A new U.N. report said success at the Geneva talks may leave a
primary problem unresolved: the return of more than 5 million
Afghan refugees who fled the war to neighboring Pakistan and Iran.
   The head of the Pakistani delegation, acting Foreign Minister
Zain Noorani, told reporters that Islamabad wants a broad-based
transitional government to be set up, but would not specify when
that should be done.
   ``We are firmly convinced that a settlement without creating
circumstances of peace and stability in Afghanistan will not
pursuade 5 million Afghan refugees ...to return,'' he said.
   Asked when such a government should take office, he said the
timing depends ``on when efforts to bring about a settlement among
the Afghans can be visibly seen and when we are able to pursuade
all parties concerned '' to establish it.
   Before the new round got under way Wednesday, Cordovez
reaffirmed that the future makeup of the Kabul government is
outside the scope of negotiations.
   The Soviets also have said they are not interested in
influencing its composition.
   The U.N. report, prepared for the 43-nation U.N. Human Rights
Commission, warned that most refugees were unlikely to return
unless the Afghan government is replaced by one that includes
opposition and refugee representation.
   The report also says the human rights situation in Afghanistan
has improved, though there is evidence political prisoners are
still being tortured and killed.
   The regime of President Najib is backed by little more than the
115,000 Red Army troops.
   The ``national reconciliation'' policy Najib proclaimed more
than a year ago has failed, Austrian jurist Felix Ermacora, special
investigator for the 43-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission, says
in the 29-page report.
   Ermacora visited refugees in Pakistan and government-controlled
areas of Afghanistan in January.
   He says in the report that most refugees he spoke with said they
would return only when ``the foreign troops had withdrawn and a
government in which they had confidence had been established.''
   Government sources were quoted in the report as saying there
were 3,147 political prisoners in January, though more than 7,000
had been released under amnesty decrees.
   But the report cites ``reliable reports'' that political
prisoners had recently been killed in the Kabul area and that there
had been torture in Ghazni province.
   It says the new Afghan constitution makes no provision ``for
free, secret and universal elections to the National Assembly'' in
balloting to be held by June. Ermacora says he doubts the Najib
regime will allow multi-party participation.
   The United States last year gave an estimated $700 million worth
of military assistance to the 200,000 guerrillas.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis accused
rival Democratic presidential candidate Richard Gephardt today of
trying to impose ``a $50 billion burden on the nation's economy''
with an oil import fee and ``duck-and-hide'' trade barriers.
   Dukakis, barnstorming across Texas in quest of the biggest Super
Tuesday primary prize of 183 delegates, defended his own opposition
to an oil import fee, which many in the ailing Texas oil industry
have hoped for.
   On a visit to MP Industries, a successful small business that
makes rubber parts for oil field drills, Dukakis said the Missouri
congressman wants to return the United States to ``policies that
almost destroyed us 50 years ago.''
   ``If we adopt Congressman Gephardt's policies, we'll have a
trade war, and nobody benefits from a trade war,'' said Dukakis.
   ``There's always somebody around who suggests that: throw up the
walls, hunker down,'' he said. Dukakis claimed his administration
would foster ``a competitive America, one that doesn't duck and
hide but stands up and competes with the best of them.''
   An oil import fee ``will put a $50 billion burden on this
nation's economy. We don't need that,'' said the governor, who
favors creating incentives for small oil producers to start
drilling again, repealing of the oil windfall tax, filling the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and increasing natural gas production.
   Dukakis was traveling across Texas today, from East Texas to
Corpus Christi to border towns to Houston and on to West Texas in
his campaign for votes in next Tuesday's primaries in 20 states.
   On Wednesday, Dukakis promised to fight to make all American
workers eligible for basic health insurance on the job. He told
uninsured workers at a free clinic in Tampa, Fla., ``It is very
disturbing to meet American families who literally don't have a
dime of basic health insurance.
   ``If they or their youngsters have to go to the hospital, they
don't know how they're going to pay those bills. ... '' he said.
``It's just unconscionable.''
   Back home, the Massachusetts House passed a Dukakis plan to
force employers with six or more workers to provide health
insurance. The state Senate is expected to follow suit within two
weeks.
   Dukakis predicted Massachusetts' example will pave the way for a
similar federal breakthrough, four decades after Harry Truman
proposed national health insurance.
   Thirty-seven million Americans are uninsured, he said. ``It's
time we decided in this country that one of the things you get
along with your wages is basic health insurance.''
   He claimed it could be done without ``creating a big new
bureaucratic program. ... This will not cost the federal Treasury a
dime.''
   Asked how small businesses could afford it, Dukakis said most
businesses already provide insurance, and indirectly pay ``a hidden
surcharge'' to cover hospitals' costs of treating the uninsured.
   Richard Posada, 32, a Tampa carpet installer who makes $18,000 a
year, told Dukakis he went without insurance when he found it would
cost him $240 a month.
   ``It's a gamble,'' said Posada. Then he found the Judeo
Christian Health Clinic here, where care for his wife and two
toddlers is free. ``They've treated us real nice here,'' the carpet
layer said.
   Dale Smith, a lawn worker with high blood pressure and no
insurance, told the candidate, ``This place has been a real
blessing to me.''
   Dukakis said if all workers had insurance, ``we'd have clinics
like this springing up all over the place.''
   The Massachusetts bill will cost the state $100 million,
including aid for hospitals hit by big debts for indigent care.
   Meanwhile, the Massachusetts governor began airing a new
television commercial attacking rival Rep. Richard Gephardt and
mocking Gephardt's populist slogan, ``It's your fight too.''
   The advertisement says Gephardt is taking campaign contributions
from ``big establishment power brokers'' and adds: ``Kinda makes
you wonder, is Dick Gephardt fighting your fight or theirs?''
   In Miami, where he was endorsed by the president of the
embattled Machinists' union at ailing Eastern Airlines, Dukakis
said, ``I hope I'll be the candidate who emerges from Super Tuesday
with the largest number of cumulative delegate votes.
   ``If we can do that, then I think we're going to be steaming
into Illinois and we're going to be on our way to the nomination,''
said Dukakis.
   Dukakis did Wednesday what a lot of visitors to Florida do this
time of year: visit a baseball spring training camp.
   But unlike ordinary tourists, Dukakis actually got to stand in
the Boston Red Sox batting cage in Winter Haven for a turn at bat.
In 10 swings against a batting practice pitcher, the onetime
catcher on the Brookline, Mass., High School freshman team hit
three foul balls, a pop into the cage and five grounders; and
fanned once.

   Tamil rebels disguised as soldiers
attacked a village with submachine guns and automatic rifles and
killed 16 people, a military official said today. Most of the
victims were woman and children.
   In a separate incident today, three rebels were killed in a gun
battle with police manning a roadblock in the southeast.
   Police Chief S. Wijesinghe of the Ampara district said there
were no police casualties. Police seized a Chinese-made T-56 rifle
and a submachine gun from the slain rebels, he said.
   The military official said the 16 were killed Wednesday at
Morawewa village, 27 miles west of Trincomalee port on the eastern
coast of Sri Lanka. He spoke on condition of anonymity according to
regulations.
   The victims included nine children, four women and three men, he
said. All were Sinhalese except for one Tamil. Three people were
injured.
   The official blamed the attack on members of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest rebel group. The Tigers have
been at the forefront of a four-year war for a separate Tamil
homeland and have targeted attacks on the majority Sinhalese
community.
   The Tigers were blamed for the killings of more than 200
Sinhalese in October last year soon after they renounced a peace
accord aimed at ending the separatist war.
   More than 8,000 people have been killed in the Tamil conflict
since 1983. Tamils, who form 18 percent of the country's 16 million
people, claim that they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese, who form 75 percent of the population.

<TEXT>
   A victim of degenerative Huntington's
disease underwent experimental surgery in which doctors removed an
adrenal gland and grafted the tissue onto the man's brain.
   It was the first time a patient with Huntington's, a fatal
disease marked by mental deterioration and uncontrollable
movements, underwent a procedure that has shown promise in
relieving symptoms of Parkinson's disease, surgeons at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center said Wednesday.
   ``It will be several months before we know if it works,'' said
Dr. George S. Allen, chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery and
director of Vanderbilt's neurotransplant program.
   The 41-year-old patient was in critical but stable condition
this morning, said John Houser, a medical center spokesman.
   ``Our hope is that this (surgery) is something that would
dramatically affect this disease,'' Dr. J.C. Ross, associate vice
chancellor for health affairs at Vanderbilt, said at a news
conference today. ``It is not a cure. Our hope is that it might
slow down the illness.''
   Surgeons said the procedure Tuesday is similar to surgery
performed at Vanderbilt last year on 18 patients with Parkinson's
disease, a brain disorder characterized by rigidity and tremors.
   ``We aren't as likely to see improvement in symptoms as with the
Parkinson's surgery, but we hope this procedure will slow down or
stop the progress of Huntington's disease,'' said Dr. Noel Tulipan,
principal investigator on the project.
   Vanderbilt doctors decided to apply the procedure to
Huntington's patients based on experiments on rats.
   The team hopes to perform more of the operations, depending on
how many volunteers there are, Ross said today.
   Vanderbilt is searching for identical twins suffering from
Huntington's who might participate in the pilot study, he said.
Because twins' genetic makeup would be exactly alike, researchers
could study the effects of the surgery by performing the operation
on one twin and allowing the disease to progress naturally in the
other, he said.
   Houser said there is evidence that a naturally occurring
chemical in the brain, quinolinic acid, may cause the degeneration
seen in Huntington's.
   Experiments demonstrated that the adrenal tissue transplant
could protect against the damage caused by the acid, he said.
   In Huntington's disease, as nerve cells in the brain die,
patients experience involuntary spasms of the face and body,
slurred speech and trouble walking.
   The patient, whose name was withheld at his family's request,
was diagnosed as having Huntington's five years ago. The disease
has caused him trouble talking and performing ordinary tasks,
forcing him to quit working three years ago. He has a wife but no
children.
   Between 10,000 and 20,000 Americans have Huntington's disease,
and 500 to 1,000 new cases occur each year.

   A judge who feared a key witness would
not show up for the trial of two people charged in the drug
overdose of their baby has ordered the witness jailed, while the
parents are free on bail.
   ``This is obscene,'' attorney Patrick McNeal said of his client,
Bruce Chavez, who was ordered jailed Wednesday as a material
witness by Orange County Superior Court Judge Francisco Briseno.
   ``This is the worst miscarriage of justice that I've seen in
recent years. It's ludicrous.''
   Gilbert Delgado, 24, and his wife, Debbie, 22, are charged with
murder, child endangerment and drug possession in the September
1986 death of their 2-month-old daughter, Stephanie. Delgado was
free on $100,000 bail and his wife was free on $50,000 bail.
   The trial of the Costa Mesa couple is scheduled June 20. Chavez,
Mrs. Delgado's brother, could be held until he testifies or posts
$100,000 bail.
   Chavez had told police that his sister and brother-in-law used
cocaine regularly and that he had seen the drug and paraphernalia
near baby bottles and bottle nipples.
   But when he was subpoenaed to appear at a preliminary hearing,
he took extreme measures to avoid an appearance, said Deputy
District Attorney Rick King. The measures included sleeping in his
truck or in parks, refusing to go home and changing his appearance.
   It wasn't until more than a year after the baby's death that the
Delgados were arrested because initial coroner's reports attributed
the death to infant death syndrome, police said. Three months
later, tests revealed she died from cocaine overdose and the
Delgados were arrested last October.

<TEXT>
   A woman has been reunited with her
kidnapped child 10 months after the state took custody of the baby
without realizing his identity.
   Alisha Wetselline-Rodriguez held her son for the first time in
more than 14 months Wednesday and was so excited she could barely
speak.
   ``I understand he has to get used to me,'' Ms.
Wetselline-Rodriguez said as she cradled her son at the home of the
boy's foster parents, John and Diane Noster, in Mesquite.
   Family Court Judge Harold Gaither Jr. returned the boy, Eric, to
Ms. Wetselline-Rodriguez's custody Wednesday after reviewing
evidence from blood tests and testimony by a Department of Human
Services caseworker.
   Eric was only 18 days old when he was taken from his home in
Dallas on Dec. 9, 1986.
   Last May, Edica Flores of East Dallas took him to St. Matthews
Cathedral. She told a priest that a woman she met in a park nine
days earlier had asked her to take care of the child for a week
while the woman went to Houston to seek work.
   The woman never returned and Dallas County Assistant District
Attorney Beverly Storey said efforts to find her have failed.
   The state took custody of the boy May 4, and it wasn't until
Christmas Eve that a caseworker's casual glance at a mass-mailed
missing children's flyer led to the discovery of the child's
identity.

   The parents of a groom in a
drought-stricken Indian state demanded that the bride's family give
them an unusual dowry: water.
   Two barrels of water have been delivered every day to the house
of the groom, Prashant Pandeya, since his recent marriage, the
United News of India reported Thursday.
   Under the dowry pact, the bride's parents, who have a steady
source of underground water, must keep up the supply until the next
monsoon, the news agency reported.
   Gujarat and 15 other states have been hit by drought, the worst
in India in a century.
   The parents of a bride normally give clothes, jewelry, cash,
furniture or electronic goods as dowry to the groom and his family.
Although outlawed in 1961, dowry still persists.

   A Japan Railways labor union leader was clubbed to
death early Thursday by a group of men who broke into his home in
an attack believed linked to fighting among radical groups, a
police official said.
   Masaru Matsushita, chairman of the regional headquarters of the
JR East Japan Workers Union, was attacked by seven or eight masked
men while alseep in his home in Takasaki, about 70 miles north of
Tokyo, the police official said.
   He was the sixth labor union official killed since September
1986 in attacks believed linked to feuding among rival radical
groups over union cooperation in the conversion of the
government-owned Japanese National Railways into a private
corporation in April.
   Matsushita, 45, died later at a hospital. His wife and three
children were uninjured, said the official, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Police were searching for the attackers, who fled in a car after
scattering needles on the road in front of Matsushita's house.

<TEXT>
   Angry farmers smeared manure in a
government office and smashed its computers to protest a planned
levy on fertilizer, police said.
   A group of about 250 farmers stormed the Netherlands Manure
Agency building during a demonstration against the levy in this
northern Dutch town, said police spokesman Eduard Vissia.
   The levy, which is to be monitored by the manure agency, is
aimed at curbing the mammoth manure surplus that threatens
Holland's water supplies.
   ``The farmers smeared dung all over the place'' after breaking
into the building's computer room, Vissia said.
   The protesters also destroyed computer equipment with farm
implements before they were thrown out of the building by riot
police, Vissia said.
   No arrests were made. No damage estimate was made, although
Vissia said it probably ran into the tens of thousands of dollars.
   The surplus amounts to about 90 million tons produced annually
by the Netherlands' 14 million pigs, 5 million cows, and 92 million
chickens.
   The oversupply stems directly from the Common Market farm
subsidy system, which until recently stimulated large-scale animal
husbandry operations.
   Under the contested plan, farmers are required to pay the
equivalent of 13 cents for every kilogram _ 2.2 pounds _ of manure
they produce in excess of the permitted 275 pounds per 2{ acres of
arable land, according to a spokeswoman for the Dutch Agriculture
Ministry.
   The levy soars to about 25 cents for every kilogram in excess of
440 pounds per 2{ acres.
   The farmers claim that the measures are punitive and demand that
the government adopt and fund a project to distribute the manure
more evenly over the Netherlands through a system of pipelines.

<TEXT>
   State prosecutors have filed charges
against the former head of the Agrokomerc company that issued
almost $1 billion in uncovered promissory notes, it was reported
Thursday.
   State prosecutors filed the charge of making
counterrevolutionary threats to socialist property against Fikret
Abdic, 48, the former director of the firm, the official news
agency Tanjug said.
   Seven of Abdic's aides were similarly charged, and four were
charged with abusing authority in the economy under especially
grave circumstances, Tanjug said.
   Abdic was arrested last summer after Yugoslav media uncovered
the scandal surrounding Agrokomerc and its practice of issuing
uncovered promissory notes.
   He has already been charged with threatening the social system
and embezzlement of social property. He faces a maximum sentence of
20 years in jail if convicted on all counts.
   The indictment against him may be altered during the trial,
according to Yugoslav law. No trial date has yet been set.
   Agrokomerc once employed 13,500 people at its headquarters in
Velika Kladusa and was touted as a model company. It has since laid
off many employees and is kept running on loans from the republic
of Bosnia, where it is located.
   More than 30 people have been arrested in the Agrokomerc scandal
and charges may be brought against as many as 200 others.
   Jail sentences of up to seven years have been passed so far on
some local officials.

   A tentative settlement has been reached in the
week-old Cleveland teachers' strike, a federal mediator said today.
   ``I'm happy to say that the School Board and the Cleveland
Federation of Teachers reached a tentative agreement and will be
reporting back to their respective constituencies,'' Jack Buettner
said late this morning. ``The parties will then review the details
of the proposal at that time.''
   Details of the agreement were not disclosed, pending a
ratification vote.
   Superintendent Al Tutela declined to comment on when schools
might re-open for the district's nearly 73,000 students.
   Eugene Kolach, president of the 5,100-member teachers union,
said union negotiators will recommend to the union's executive
committee that the tentative agreement be approved.
   Early this morning, members of the Cleveland School Board said
they believed progress was being made toward ending the strike.
   On Tuesday, Craig Brown, chief negotator for the school board,
had said talks seemed to be snagged on the issue of ``career
ladder,'' a plan to hinge some pay raises largely on performance
evaluations.
   The union's contract expired in September. Teaching salaries
range from $17,600 to $37,450, depending on education and
experience. The average teacher makes $29,000 annually.
   Tutela said the district's 2,951 non-teaching school employees,
such as maintenance workers and janitors, were being laid off this
week. The layoffs were to continue during the strike, he said.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis accused rival Richard
Gephardt today of trying to impose ``a $50 billion burden'' on the
nation's economy with an oil import fee, and Republican Rep. Jack
Kemp added to the criticism the candidates are heaping on
Panamanian strong man Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Sen. Bob Dole picked up an endorsement from former U.N.
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, which could give him a boost with
some conservative Republicans, and Democratic Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
of Tennessee got endorsements from former Virginia Gov. Charles
Robb and Louisiana Gov.-elect Buddy Roemer.
   One day earlier, George Bush rebuked Bob Dole for implying that
Bush, as CIA chief, may have had dealings with Noriega. And
Gephardt was the target of stinging attacks by two Democratic
opponents.
   With Southern exposure at a premium in the final five days of
Super Tuesday campaigning, the candidates were saturating the
airwaves with attacks and appeals, and barnstorming their way from
Lubbock to Little Rock.
   Tuesday's 20-state round of primaries and caucuses is
concentrated in the South. For both parties, more than half the
delegates needed to clinch the nomination are at stake.
   Today, in Tyler, Texas, Dukakis defended his opposition to an
oil import fee, which many in the ailing Texas oil industry have
hoped for. ``We don't need that,'' said the governor, who instead
favors incentives for small oil producers, repeal of the oil
windfall tax and other measures to increase U.S. production.
   Kemp, in South Carolina today, praised the Reagan
administration's move to keep Panamanian assets in U.S. banks from
going to the government run by Noriega. And he pledged that if he
becomes president and Noriega remains in power, he will push for
the Senate to repeal the U.S. treaty with Panama and regain control
of the Panama Canal.
   On Wednesday, Dole and Bush traded jabs as the two campaigned in
Louisiana. The Kansas senator, in New Orleans, hinted at a
Bush-Noriega connection.
   ``There's some evidence (Noriega) was on the CIA payroll as far
back as 1966. That's all I know,'' he said. Bush headed the Central
Intelligence Agency during 1976 and 1977.
   Dole offered no evidence that Bush was aware of Noriega's
alleged drug dealing, but suggested that a lack of knowledge would
be almost as damning.
   ``He says he made all these decisions at the CIA,'' Dole said.
``What were they? Was Noriega on the payroll when he was CIA
director?''
   The vice president fired back from Baton Rouge: ``I find it
amazing that a United States senator will talk about CIA matters.''
   ``I took an oath of office to protect sources and methods of
intelligence and I would never discuss anything I was doing at the
CIA that would affect the national security,'' Bush said, adding:
``I would point out that it's the Reagan-Bush administration under
which Mr. Noriega is being indicted in Florida for drugs.''
   Noriega is under federal indictment in Miami on drug-trafficking
charges.
   Dole, acknowledging he's ``got a lot of catching up to do'' in
the South, is running a commercial that ridicules Bush for using
the French phrase ``c'est la vie'' _ that's life _ in connection
with textile imports that have hurt the economy in the Carolinas.
   The ad touts an endorsement from South Carolina Sen. Strom
Thurmond, pointedly noting that Thurmond's Southern-accented praise
of Dole is delivered in English.
   Dukakis weighed in with an ad attacking Gephardt, mocking the
Missouri congressman's populist slogan, ``It's your fight too.''
   After charging that Gephardt is taking campaign contributions
from ``big establishment power brokers,'' the commercial concludes:
``Kinda makes you wonder, is Dick Gephardt fighting your fight or
theirs?''
   Gephardt also came under fire from Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
Jr., who accused him of flip-flopping on issues. ``Where he stands
can change very quickly from day to day,'' said Gore as he
campaigned in Wyoming, which holds presidential caucuses on
Saturday.
   Gephardt took a campaign-trail detour down memory lane,
returning to his hometown of St. Louis. Speaking at City Hall,
Gephardt, who got his political start on the board of alderman,
pointed to his former desk and said: ``It's great to be back on
home turf.''
   More to the point, he raised $25,000 at a Springfield campaign
reception and told supporters he'd pour the money into his Super
Tuesday effort.
   ``While other campaigns may be borrowing and scurrying to raise
money for Super Tuesday, we put the money on the table,'' he said.
   Democrat Paul Simon was staying above the campaign-commercial
fray. Simon, citing a lack of funds, has bypassed active
campaigning in the South to concentrate on his home state of
Illinois, which holds its primary March 15. Even there, he's
eschewing advertising.
   ``Abe Lincoln didn't do TV,'' said Simon spokesman Michael
Kreloff.
   Jesse Jackson was kicking off his first big media buy of the
campaign season. His manager, Gerald Austin, said Jackson had
purchased $100,000 in air time in several Super Tuesday states.
   Republican Pat Robertson, meanwhile, sought to score some
political points by repeatedly invoking Jackson's name.
   ``I see some signs here of my friend Jesse Jackson,'' the former
television evangelist told a predominantly black crowd at the
Orangeburg campus of South Carolina State College. ``What Jesse has
been saying is what I'm saying to you.''

<HEAD>Japan Halts Computer Chip Dumping, But Still Closing Out U.S.
Chips</HEAD>

   President Reagan's sanctions against Japanese
electronics imports have halted computer chip ``dumping'' but have
failed to boost sales of U.S. chips in Japan, an industry group
said Thursday.
   The Semiconductor Industry Association said that by the end of
1987, the U.S. share of the Japanese chip market was only 10
percent, the historical level and up only slightly from the 9
percent share that existed when the sanctions were announced last
April.
   The association urged the Reagan administration to leave in
place $165 million in remaining sanctions on Japanese electronics
imports and said ``other measures,'' including additional
sanctions, might be sought.
   It also requested new high-level consultations with government
officials on the subject of computer component trade.
   In a joint statement, the semiconductor association,
representing chip makers, and the American Electronics Association,
representing users, called on the government to help open Japanese
markets further and to insure a ``fair allocation'' of chips to the
U.S. market.
   ``The issue of access to the Japanese market remains
problematic,'' the semiconductor group said in a review of
compliance with a 1986 agreement between the United States and
Japan on semiconductors.
   Under that agreement, ``the foreign market share expected in
Japan by the end of 1987 was 12.3 percent,'' the report said.
   The 1986 agreement called for Japanese companies to stop
marketing computer chips in the United States and other markets at
artifically low prices, a practice known as dumping. U.S. chip
makers claimed the Japanse pricing pratices were driving them out
of business.
   Another part of the agreement called for Japanese companies to
buy more U.S.-made chips, with foreign-based industries' share in
Japan to rise to a level slightly above 20 percent by 1991.
   Japan's alleged failure to comply with terms of the agreement
caused Reagan to impose $300 million in sanctions on imports of
Japanese televisions, computers and power tools last April.
   The administration, in two installments, lifted $135 million of
those penalties, citing progress by Japan in halting the dumping.
But it left $165 million in place, claiming lack of progress in the
``market access'' area.
   Thursday's assessment by the semiconductor association backed up
government claims that all dumping had ceased in the aftermath of
the sanctions, both in the United States and in foreign markets.
   Computer chips, or semiconductors, are the tiny electrical
circuits that are the building blocks of computers and many other
electronic devices.
   They are called semiconductors because the material from which
they are made _ usually silicon _ is a poor conductor of
electricity in its normal state but allows electricity to pass
freely with the application of small amounts of light, heat or
voltage.
   As a result of the battering American companies took from
low-cost Japanese imports, many U.S. companies stopped
manufacturing basic categories of computer chips altogther, leading
to a shortage currently.

   Pizzerias and pep rallies, the normal
elements of teen life, are part of a bizarre murder case in which
the defendant allegedly killed a classmate for a thrill, then
showed the corpse to friends who stayed mum for weeks about the
macabre secret in the snowy woods.
   The case, which began unfolding Wednesday in Norfolk Superior
Court, features accusations that a 14-year-old plotted the crime
for nearly a month, sorting through a list of possible victims.
   It includes young friends, now his chief accusers, who told a
shocked courtroom of viewing a dead classmate only hours after a
pre-Thanksgiving pep rally, then going with the alleged killer for
a snack at a shopping mall pizza parlor.
   ``He said he wanted to know what it was like to kill somebody,''
Robbie Peterson, 16, testified about defendant Rod Matthews.
   Matthews, now 15, is being tried as an adult for the Nov. 20,
1986, bludgeoning of 14-year-old Shaun Ouillette. According to the
prosecutor, the thin, bespectacled defendant coldly killed his
victim with a baseball bat, then calmly lied to police about his
victim's whereabouts.
   ``He was deliberate in the plan and put it into effect
efficiently and effectively,'' said Assistant District Attorney
Peter Casey.
   Matthews' defense attorney painted another picture of the youth,
that of a mentally ill child from a troubled home whose use of the
prescribed stimulant Ritalin contributed to his murderous actions.
   ``In this case is the insidious element of mental illness with
the overlying thread of Ritalin,'' attorney John Philip White told
the jury.
   Under cross-examination today by White, 16-year-old Jonathan
Cash said Matthews was known for volatile behavior and was
fascinated by fire.
   Cash, in his second day on the stand, also testified that he
sent an anonymous letter to police about Ouillette's body in
December 1986 after going to see the body by himself late at night
and suffering several nights of troubled sleep.
   According to the prosecutor and testimony by Peterson and Cash,
Matthews began talking about killing someone about Halloween of
1986. They said he eventually decided to lure a victim to a wooded
area known as ``The Pits,'' then beat him with a baseball bat.
Peterson said Matthews also planned to cut off his victim's legs
``and toss them.''
   ``I said why? ... He said, `Just for the heck of it,''' Peterson
testified.
   The teen-ager, testifying in a barely audible voice, told how
Matthews named several potential victims before settling on
Ouillette, an overweight high school freshman who had moved to the
community south of Boston a year earlier.
   ``He said he (Ouillette) would be the least missed, that he
didn't have that many friends,'' Peterson testified.
   Peterson said he had warned other potential victims not to go to
Matthews' home, but although he knew Matthews planned to lure
Ouillette into the woods with the promise of fireworks, Peterson
said he only told Ouillette, on the day he died, to have Matthews
bring the fireworks to school.
   After school that day, Peterson said he was playing with a
radio-controlled car when he saw Matthews walking down the street
with a baseball bat. When he asked if Matthews had killed
Ouillette, Peterson said the defendant hesitated before admitting
to the killing. The talk of murder was interrupted for a snowball
fight with neighborhood children, Peterson testified.
   Peterson said Matthews then agreed to take him to the murder
scene.
   The teen-ager testified that Matthews explained how he walked in
Ouillette's footsteps in the snow, then clubbed him in the head
with a bat as the victim set off bottle rockets.
   ``He said Shaun fell down and said `help me' and Rod hit him
again.'' Peterson said Matthews told him how he cleaned the bloody
bat in the snow.
   Ouillette's mother, Jeanne Quinn, sobbed as she heard the
description of her son's murder. Matthews stared at the wooden
table without expression while his mother, Janice, bowed her head.
   Under cross examination, Peterson said he would have gone for
help if he thought Ouillette was still alive. He also acknowledged
telling authorities early in the investigation that Matthews told
him ``everything just went blank and he went after Shaun.''
   Peterson testified that a week later, he and Cash viewed the
body again with Matthews after the school rally. As the three rode
their bicycles from the murder site to the mall, Matthews warned
his friends not to talk.
   ``Rod said not to say anything,'' Peterson said. ``He said it
could happen to us. He said, `You never know.'''

   Gov. Evan Mecham drew criticism at his
Senate impeachment trial for sending all 30 senators a statement
pleading his case, but gained promises of $100,000 in defense funds
at a raucous rally.
   Several senators said Wednesday it was inappropriate for the
first-term Republican governor to contact them because they are
serving as his judges and jury. Mecham attorney Thomas Crowe
contended there was nothing wrong with the governor's action.
   The trial resumed today with testimony by Department of Public
Safety Lt. Col. James Chilcoat on an allegation that Mecham tried
to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state
official.
   Chilcoat told about meetings that occurred before Mecham was
told about the alleged threat on Nov. 13, 1987. ``It appeared to me
that somebody was attempting to threaten a potential witness before
a statewide grand jury,'' Chilcoat testified.
   The Senate today also threw out a subpoena of state grand jury
records in connection with the alleged threat.
   In television interviews this morning, Mecham said he hasn't
broken any laws and will be found innocent if the senators listen
to their constituents.
   The Senate also was expected to consider whether to allow
testimony intended to discredit DPS Director Ralph Milstead, the
key witness on the death threat allegation.
   Presiding Judge Frank X. Gordon Jr. said Wednesday he would not
allow testimony on allegations about Milstead's sex life, but the
Senate could decide to overrule his decision. Milstead has
dismissed as ridiculous the allegation that he had an affair with
an employee in 1982.
   Mecham is accused of ordering Milstead not to cooperate with the
attorney general's investigation of the alleged threat.
   Mecham's former chief bodyguard, DPS Lt. Beau Johnson, testified
he considered the alleged threat to be a possible felony and that
he fully informed Mecham of the seriousness of the matter.
   In cross-examination, defense lawyer Fred Craft suggested the
alleged threat by then-state official Lee Watkins against former
top Mecham aide Donna Carlson was a ``political matter,'' not a
crime. But Johnson testified, ``I did not really think of it in the
political sense.''
   At the time of the alleged threat, Ms. Carlson was scheduled to
testify before a grand jury on a $350,000 campaign loan Mecham is
accused of concealing. Watkins has denied he told state official
Peggy Griffith that if her friend Ms. Carlson did not keep her
mouth shut she might ``go on a long boat ride.''
   Craft might become a grand jury witness himself, some senators
said, because he attended the meeting at which Johnson has
testified that he told Mecham of the alleged threat. Minority
Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat, said he believes Senate rules
allow a senator to ask that Craft be called as a witness.
   Stephens also said many senators were questioning whether it was
appropriate that Mecham sent senators a copy of a public statement
he made Saturday arguing that the Senate trial be delayed until
after his March 22 criminal trial on charges of concealing the
$350,000 loan.
   Democratic Sen. Jesus Higuera displayed the statement on the
Senate floor and urged fellow lawmakers not to read it.
   ``I hope Governor Mecham understands the oath we have taken,''
Higuera said. ``It's inappropriate to attempt to communicate with
us.''
   But Crowe said, ``It's a political proceeding. ... The senators
have received communications from many people pro and con. I don't
see why the governor should be any different.''
   Mecham, who also faces a May 17 recall election, received a
$50,000 check from supporters at a $20-a-person rally Wednesday
night in Tempe. The rally by 4,000 people would raise more than
$100,000 after expenses, said organizer John Thomas.
   This morning, on NBC's ``Today'' program, Mecham said there is a
``groundswell'' of support for him because ``people are now seeing
what's happened, that this is an attempt at a railroad job.''
   Mecham told ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that now that the
trial is being televised ``there's great reaction from the people.''
   The governor also told ``CBS This Morning'' that he wasn't
attending the impeachment trial because he expected to return to
office and ``was keeping track of some things. .... I don't want
everything to get clear out of hand.''
   Among those in the wildly cheering crowd Wednesday was a man in
a train engineer's cap, signifying the ``railroading'' of the
governor, and a woman in a kangaroo costume, symbolizing a
``kangaroo court.''
   Mecham, 63, was forced to step down pending the trial after the
House impeached him Feb. 5. In addition to the death threat and
loan allegations, he is accused of misusing $80,000 from the
governor's protocol fund by lending it to his auto dealership.
   A two-thirds Senate vote is required to convict Mecham, the
first U.S. governor in nearly 60 years to face an impeachment trial.
   Meanwhile, acting Gov. Rose Mofford, a Democrat, fired one of
Mecham's top aides, Max Hawkins, saying he had ``engaged in a
number of personal attacks on state elected officials.'' Hawkins
said he was fired because he is a whistle-blower.
   Hawkins has accused Rep. Jim Skelly, chairman of the House
impeachment committee, of interfering on a friend's behalf in a
state Racing Commission investigation. Skelly responded Wednesday
on the House floor that Hawkins is ``a pathological liar, and it's
not surprising because he works for Governor Mecham, and Governor
Mecham wouldn't know the truth if it bit him in the nose.''

   Crowds thronged to holiday festivals across the
country and 25 people were trampled to death during celebrations in
two cities, it was reported Thursday.
   At least 220 people were injured during the celebrations
Wednesday of the Lantern Festival, which falls 15 days after the
Lunar New Year.
   Eighteen people were crushed to death and 113 were injured in
Xining, capital of Qinghai province, when 100,000 people who turned
out to watch a lantern procession panicked, the official Xinhua
News Agency said.
   Seven people were trampled to death and another seven injured in
Lankao county, Henan province, as a crowd of 20,000 dispersed after
watching a fireworks show, Xinhua said.
   The Ministry of Public Security issued an emergency circular
Thursday calling attention to the problem of crowd control and
safety.
   The Lantern Festival traditionally closes two weeks of
celebrations that draw big crowds to admire the colorful and
elaborate lanterns on display.

<HEAD>Carlucci: Appeals for More NATO Spending Must be Carefully Worded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assocaited Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American requests to Europe to spend more for
NATO's defense will fail if the appeals are based on U.S. budget
deficits, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said Thursday.
   Instead, the United States must convince the other 15 members of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to increase NATO's budget
because it is in the best interests of the alliance, Carlucci said.
   As Carlucci was speaking, President Reagan and other NATO
leaders were winding up a two-day meeting of alliance leaders,
their first such session since 1982.
   Carlucci, speaking to the Senate Budget Committee, echoed
Reagan's call for NATO to go ahead with its previous plans to build
a new generation of non-nuclear weapons to defend against a Soviet
attack.
   Criticism of NATO has long been popular on Capitol Hill among
legislators of both parties, who complain that Western European
nations don't pay enough of the common defense bill.
   That criticism has increased in recent months, particularly
because rising U.S. budget deficits have led Congress to target the
Pentagon as a chief method of cutting federal spending.
   ``I think we need to approach a burden-sharing undertaking as an
effort to strengthen the alliance, not as effort to solve our
budget problems,'' said Carlucci.
   ``If we go to the allies and say we've been obliged to cut our
budget, therefore you have to make up the difference, I predict a
lack of success,'' he said.
   ``On the other hand, if we're able to exercise leadership,''
NATO may go along with previous plans to improve weapons, despite
political opposition in Europe, Carlucci said.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the committee, noted
that ``the lion's share of the load (borne by NATO) has been
carried by the United States.''
   While U.S. wealth is less compared to the years after World War
II, he said ``the contribution we make to our alliances remains
very high.''
   ``And so it seems reasonable to ask how those with new wealth _
acquired in a world made more stable by American sacrifice _ might
carry more of freedom's burden,'' he said.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., suggested that public criticism is the
not the best way to win increased defense budgets in Europe and
suggested that ``quiet diplomacy'' be used.
   ``NATO-bashing at this time is not the way to solve the
problem,'' Exon told the committee.
   The United States is becoming more and more reliant on its
partners in NATO, said Adm. William Crowe Jr., chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   ``With respect to risks, the 1989 budget recognizes that a
coalition strategy has become more _ not less _ important to the
United States,'' he said.
   ``Similarly, it (the budget) was structured to preserve and
optimize U.S. contributions to the collective security of NATO
Europe and our allies in Asia,'' Crowe said.
   ``We are not well positioned, however, to fill the gaps if, for
one reason or another, some of the allies decide to reduce defense
spending levels, shed defense commitments, or trim back on
conventional force improvements,'' he said.

   The Transportation Department today proposed
widespread drug testing covering tens of thousands of airline
employees and said such tests are needed to ``maintain public
confidence'' in the aviation system.
   The proposal, due to take effect in several months, would cover
pilots, flight attendants and other workers involved with safety or
security.
   Aviation unions have strongly opposed widespread testing,
agruing that no evidence has been produced showing drug use to be a
significant problem among the nation's airlines.
   But Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said that the tests are
needed because ``all it takes is one person on drugs in one of
these sensitive airline jobs to endanger the lives of hundreds of
innocent people.''
   The regulation, when it takes affect after a period of public
comment, would require a broad range of testing including
pre-employment tests, random tests and post-accident tests.
   Employees covered by the proposal would include all flight crew
members as well as aircraft dispatchers, mechanics and security
workers at airport screening checkpoints.
   ``I firmly believe that drug testing, especially random testing,
is absolutely critical in our efforts to create a drug-free
aviation system for the American people,'' Burnley told a news
coinference.
   Allan McArtor, administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration, which will enforce the new regulations, said that
the testing program, although controversial, is ``essential to
maintaining public confidence in flying (by) ... insuring a
drug-free aviation workforce.''
   The airline pilots association and unions representing flight
attendants have strongly opposed plans for widespread testing,
arguing it is an invasion of privacy when no safety threat has been
shown.
   Congress has been debating legislation that would require drug
testing in various forms of transportation, including aviation and
railroads, but no legislation has been approved, partly because of
strong labor opposition.

   For thousands of people fleeing
communist Vietnam, the fishing towns and beaches of Thailand's east
coast were once steppingstones to the West, easy to reach by boat.
   But with nearly 12,000 new arrivals last year, Thailand has
cracked down on the refugees. Marine police and navy boats
intercept and turn away the ``boat people,'' over protests by the
United States, the United Nations and Western aid agencies.
   Western officials are concerned at what they see as an erosion
of the principle of ``first asylum,'' or temporary haven for
refugees from Indochina.
   Authorities have quietly turned away some boat people for years.
But in January, Bangkok declared for the first time that its policy
includes expulsions, and mounted a blockade of waters bordering
Cambodia. Most of the Vietnamese pay for passage on smugglers'
boats from Cambodia.
   The Thais say the Vietnamese are not fleeing political
persecution, but are seeking better economic conditions. They said
the migrants add to the country's already sizable burden of illegal
aliens and threaten national security.
   ``Most are not refugees. The war ended 13 years ago,'' said
Somporn Klinpongsa, the deputy permanent secretary of the Interior
Ministry. He referred to the 1975 communist victory over the
U.S.-backed South Vietnam government.
   ``Before they came in on small boats. Now we try to stop them,''
Somporn said as he pointed to waters off this district in Trat
province where many Vietnamese attempt to land. He was guiding
foreign diplomats on a recent marine police boat tour of the coast.
   Somporn claimed 30,000 ``economic migrants'' were waiting at
Cambodia's major seaport, Kompongsom, to take boats into Thailand.
   U.S. Ambassador to Thailand William A. Brown told a
congressional hearing in Washington last week that a Thai fishing
vessel reportedly rammed a boat carrying Vietnamese, resulting in
drownings.
   Western aid officials said a number of Vietnamese drowned when
smugglers trying to evade the blockade forced them to swim to
islands off Trat. At least two people died of illness as more than
500 Vietnamese on the islands for a while had no regular source of
food, water and medical care. There is concern that others may be
stranded, unknown to authorities.
   Nearly a million Indochinese have fled to Thailand since the
communist takeovers in 1975, and in recent years the Thais have
bitterly complained that the West has reneged on pledges to
resettle them.
   According to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees, about 117,000 Vietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians
remained in Thai refugee camps at the end of May 1987.
   As of January, there were 16,040 Vietnamese in camps in Thailand.
   Western nations, meanwhile, resettled 5,275 Vietnamese in 1987.
The numbers dropped from a high of 26,574 in 1981 to a low of 3,391
in 1982, the office said.
   The overall number of Indochinese resettled in 1986 was 26,804,
about 4,400 fewer than in 1985.
   The Thai government toughened policies on Laotian and Cambodian
migrants last year.
   It clamped down on the Vietnamese after almost 12,000 arrived in
1987, triple the number the previous year, and reports surfaced
that local officials in Trat were involved in the smuggling. The
governor and provincial police superintendant were among those who
have since been transferred.
   Most Vietnamese refugees travel overland to Cambodia. There,
with the help of a network of smugglers, they board chartered
fishing boats that try to slip into Trat at night. The route is
much shorter and safer than the traditional passage across the Gulf
of Thailand to the southern coast.
   Electronics, vehicle spare parts and strategic contraband
regularly are smuggled to Cambodia and Vietnam aboard the boats.
   Somporn said boats that are intercepted are given fuel, food and
medicine and told to turn back out to sea.
   At first, authorities also towed back out to sea hundreds of
Vietnamese who had already made it to shore. Somporn said such
people now can stay, but will no longer be sent to Phanat Nikhom, a
camp near Bangkok where Western countries interview Indochinese for
resettlement.
   Instead, they go to camps near the Cambodian border where
chances of resettlement are slight and they risk danger from the
war between Cambodian guerrillas and Vietnamese troops occupying
the country.
   Although Somporn claims most of the refugees fled for economic
reasons, 66 percent of the Vietnamese who arrived in Thailand last
year told international aid workers they were persecuted because
they were ethnic Chinese or had spent time in political
``re-education'' camps.
   Less than 2 percent cited economic reasons for leaving their
homeland. Many Vietnamese detained at the Khlong Yai police station
said they fled to rejoin relatives in the United States.
   Reporters were able to interview them briefly only during the
diplomats' visit. Authorities have limited access to the Vietnamese
by journalists and aid workers.

   Authorities charged a 21-year-old man
today in the shooting of four teen-agers fired on after a high
school basketball game.
   Nathan Ward of North Chicago was charged with aggravated battery
and armed violence, Deputy Police Chief Terry House said.
   The shooting occurred late Wednesday outside Waukegan East High
School after a regional semifinal basketball game between Waukegan
East and North Chicago High School. Waukegan East won, 77-56.
   Investigators had not established a motive for the shooting, but
had ruled out involvement with drugs, gangs and the game, House
said.
   Investigators recovered a .38-caliber handgun, he said, and a
second person was being sought for questioning.
   Two teen-agers injured in the shooting were in satisfactory
condition at Victory Memorial Hospital with arm wounds. Two others
were treated at the scene and sent home, police said.
   Frank Young, principal of Waukegan East, said the shooting
occurred 30 minutes after the game, and most of the estimated 2,000
fans had left.
   Larry TenPas, a Waukegan alderman and teacher at Waukegan East,
said he saw a man fire shots at the students who were milling
around the school.

   House Speaker Jim Wright said today a
Democratic plan for giving purely ``humanitarian'' aid to
Nicaragua's Contra rebels represents a chance for the United States
to take a positive role in its relations with Central America.
   ``It's a battle for peace in Nicaragua and for a constructive
role for the United States in Central America, as opposed to a
destructive role,'' Wright, D-Texas, said of a showdown vote over
rival Democratic and Republican aid plans set for later in the day.
   But President Reagan, in a letter to House Republicans sent
while he was attending a meeting of Western allies in Brussels,
Belgium, said Wright's plan ``does not meet the essential
criteria'' of keeping the Contras alive as a fighting force capable
of putting military pressure on the leftist Sandinista regime.
   ``Today could represent a watershed in our policies toward
Central America,'' Reagan wrote. ``One avenue will lead to rapid
debilitation of the resistance and further encouragement of
Sandinista intransigence. The other could keep alive prospects for
democracy and meaningful talks toward peace.
   As with virtually all past votes on U.S. aid for the Contras,
the showdown late today promised to be close. But Democratic
vote-counters said they believed they would win with at least as
wide a margin as a month ago, when the House defeated a Reagan aid
package 219 to 211.
   On an early procedural vote to adopt rules for floor debate,
Democrats prevailed, 225 to 187. But leaders cautioned that the
ballot was not a true test of whether the Democratic aid package
would pass.
   They also said they believed a move by Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega to dismiss Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo as mediator
in cease-fire talks with the Contras and propose direct talks in
Nicaragua would have little effect on the outcome.
   In Brussels, Reagan said during a picture-taking session that
``we have always believed there should be direct talks between the
people of Nicaragua who want freedom and have been called Contras
because of that, and the present government.''
   But of the move to dismiss the cardinal as an intermediary,
Reagan said: ``I don't understand that at all.''
   House Republicans, angry over what they considered an unfair
procedure under which the bill was being brought up, vowed not to
go away quietly.
   ``We're going to fight them on everything,'' said Rep. Mickey
Edwards, R-Okla., who has led the fight for Contra aid in the
House. ``It's gotten a lot of Republicans mad.''
   The $30.5 million Democratic proposal called for about $16
million in food, clothing, medicine and shelter for the
anti-Sandinista rebels, and another $14 million to set up a fund to
help children injured in the seven-year Nicaraguan civil war.
   Democrats were working to keep the support of moderate party
members who helped design the package, and keep to a minimum
defections by members of the party's left wing, most of whom never
have voted for aid to the rebels in any form.
   Party leaders argued that passage of this purely
``humanitarian'' aid bill would lessen chances that the
administration could come back to Congress soon with a request for
weapons and ammunition to sustain the guerrilla war.
   A Republican alternative contained more money _ about $36
million _ and placed fewer restrictions on the way the Contras
could use the aid. But it appeared unlikely the GOP version would
come to a vote because of Democratic-designed rules that called for
their package to come up first.
   Edwards said the key difference between the two bills was that
the Democrats' version offered no guarantees of quick consideration
of a future Reagan administration request for military aid for the
rebels. The GOP package would permit Reagan to ask for such aid any
time after April 15, and would require expedited congressional
action.
   ``Unless we put expedited procedures in the bill, the Contras
get nothing and the Sandinistas get no threat. That really is the
bottom-line issue,'' he said.
   And Edwards noted that the Democratic bill would turn over
responsibility for delivery of the ``humanitarian'' supplies to the
Pentagon, rather than the existing CIA-run supply network. Even if
the Pentagon retained the private contractors now used by the CIA
to make supply flights, U.S. military personnel would have to be
present in the region to oversee them, he said.
   The Republican alternative would leave the delivery of supplies
in the hands of the CIA.
   Wright on Wednesday defended the procedure under which the two
bills were being brought to the floor, saying the Republicans had
had their chance for a vote a month ago, when the House defeated
Reagan's last aid request.
   ``If ours were not offered (under the Democrats' procedure),
many of our members argued we might never get to vote on our
plan,'' Wright said. ``I don't think it's unfair to them.''

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 11 people were reported killed
and hundreds injured Thursday in violence related to Parliamentary
elections, which the opposition denounced as fraudulent and a
failure.
   Early results showed President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's Jatiya
Party with the lead in 53 of the 282 constituencies where ballots
were cast. Eighteen of his candidates had already been declared
elected to Parliament for lack of opposition candidates.
   Initial returns from nine other constituencies showed minor
opposition parties leading. Major opposition parties boycotted the
vote.
   Newspapers, quoting reliable sources, said 11 people were killed
in confrontations during the day between supporters of rival
candidates.
   Home Minister Abdul Matin said only five people died _ four in
Dhaka and one in nearby Manikganj. He said 80 were injured and 55
were hospitalized.
   The opposition's call for a general strike shut down most of the
capital.
   ``There was no turnout, there was no election,'' said Sheik
Hasina, leader of the main opposition Awami League. ``Perhaps the
so-called candidates voted.''
   But Matin told reporters that on the basis of 12 voting centers
he visited in Dhaka, he estimated voter to be 50 percent of the
47.8 million eligible to cast ballots.
   Reporters who went to a dozen polling stations in and around the
capital said a reasonable turnout was apparent at only three. Two
had been shut down by violence by midmorning.
   At several stations, election officials and even workers for
Ershad's Jatiya Party admitted that ballot boxes were stuffed and
voter turnout exaggerated.
   Ms. Hasina vowed the opposition camp of 21 parties would keep up
the campaign it began in November to oust Ershad as president.
   Ershad scheduled Thursday's elections after he dissolved
Parliament last December, 3{ years ahead of schedule. The move was
aimed at working out a compromise with his foes, but they demanded
instead that Ershad step down and said elections held under him
wouldn't be fair.
   The governing Jatiya Party won 152 seats in the last
parliamentary elections in 1986, and the Awami League won 102 of
the 330 seats. Small parties held the rest.
   Ershad, speaking to reporters after casting his ballot in Dhaka,
said he thought this election would end the violence.
   ``After this, things certainly will improve,'' he said.
   Ershad said he had no plans for another election soon. ``The
parliament is elected for five years by the people ... I expect it
to serve for five years.''
   Ms. Hasina maintained that Bangladeshis had rejected the
election.
   ``The whole nation has sided with us,'' Hasina said. ``That is
our achievement.''
   At Savar, 12 miles north of Dhaka, a Jatiya worker named Khalil
Mahmood said ballots were fraudulently stamped for Jatiya and also
for other parties to make the rigging less obvious.
   ``We finished by 11 a.m. and we even gave some votes to other
candidates,'' he said.
   Matin said he had no reports of vote rigging. He said voting was
suspended at 170 of the 22,393 polling booths because of violence
or election officials' failure to arrive to man the stations.
   Matin noted that there had been 21 deaths in the 1986
parliamentary election and said of Thursday's vote: ``It's a
successful and peaceful election.''
   In Chittagong, Bangladesh's second largest city, reporters
quoted police and hospital sources as saying more than 100 people
were injured in violence.

<HEAD>Dole's Southern Strategy Is To Slow Down Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bob Dole is looking beyond next
week's big round of Southern primaries and hoping his candidacy can
get beyond it too.
   ``When all is said and done,'' the Republican presidential
hopeful said at a Florida rally, ``this is probably going to go all
the way to California now.''
   If the race for the Republican presidential nomination doesn't
prove as long as he suggests, going on until the last round of
primaries in early June, Dole probably won't be the nominee.
   The Southern primaries _ South Carolina on Saturday and the rest
of the region on Super Tuesday _ aren't going to get him there.
George Bush leads Dole by as much as 3-to-1 in polls of the South.
   While Dole figures to run better than that in the popular vote,
the Republicans' delegate allotment system means the real score in
delegates may be that bad or worse. And Pat Robertson is a GOP wild
card that could siphone off more delegates.
   ``It's a struggle,'' said Dole press secretary Dale Tate. ``But
I don't think anybody here thinks we won't survive. It's going to
be a long time to New Orleans'' and the Republican convention.
   But with 712 GOP delegates at stake that day, Bush has the
potential to go a long way toward the 1,139 delegates needed to
nominate.
   Dole's problem is how to keep Bush from running up such a
collection of victories on Tuesday that he is unstoppable when the
race turns to the next round of big industrial states.
   The grim potential of Super Tuesday for Dole heightens the
importance of the next primary, Illinois on March 15.
   Dole forces figure they must be able to bounce back there.
   ``I think if Dole doesn't win Illinois, it's just about over,''
said one Dole campaign official, speaking only on condition of
anonymity.
   Facing that reality, Dole is attacking Bush with a broad brush
as a man with no more of a record than the embarrassment of
involvement in the sale of arms to Iran for hostages.
   But he also is carefully choosing his spots in the states and
congressional districts where he has a chance of success.
   ``We're going to win some states here,'' Dole pollster Richard
Wirthlin said in Atlanta last weekend. ``We're doing well in areas
that can be typified as the New South.
   ``We're going to be very competitive in four or five states,''
Wirthlin said.
   Dole forces see their best chances among the 14 Southern and
border states voting Tuesday to be in Missouri, with 47 delegates
at stake, Oklahoma, with 36, and North Carolina, with 54.
   They would like to score some surprises in Alabama, Arkansas,
and in certain portions of Florida and Georgia.
   Among the states outside the South voting on Tuesday, they are
focusing on Rhode Island, with 21 delegates, and Washington state,
where the 41 delegates aren't allocated by the primary but where a
victory would give Dole something to talk about.
   North Carolina is the state where Dole's wife Elizabeth is from
and where together they have appeared often over the years. It is
also a state where textiles is a major industry, and Dole has been
attacking the vice president's opposition to limits on foreign
textile imports.
   Dole is also on the air in South Carolina, Missouri, Oklahoma
and Arkansas, and has small amounts of TV commercials on in Rhode
Island and Florida.
   Doe has injected anew the Iran-Contra affair into the campaign
with another ad that says: ``Dole opposed selling arms to Iran.
Bush supported the arms for hostages deal.''
   Part of Dole's frustration is that Bush has been able to appear
the rightful heir to President Reagan's conservative legacy in the
South, where Reagan has always been strong. Dole seeks to tarnish
Bush, while straining to avoid seeming to attack Reagan, which he
knows would backfire.
   And he has been frustrated that Bush's support in the region,
often described as broad but thin, has not proven brittle.
   ``We know Bush has a big lead in the South,'' Dole said. ``For
some reason, his people believe he's from the South or something.''

<HEAD>Super Tuesday Scorecard Presents Challenge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political scorekeepers face a complex
challenge next Tuesday as they try to track who wins roughly
one-third of the delegates to the Democratic and Republican
national conventions.
   Super Tuesday's chain of events, stretching from the U.S.
Atlantic coast almost to the international date line in the Pacific
Ocean, relies on dozens of complicated and often confusing rules.
   In some cases, the process is so tangled that it's hard to agree
even on how many delegates are involved.
   For example, the Republicans are holding 16 or 17 events on
Super Tuesday, and 712, 753 or 803 delegates are involved. All of
those figures are correct, depending on how the question is phrased.
   The reason for the discrepancies is some of the GOP events
count, some don't and others can't be sorted out until later.
   Sixteen of the Republican events will have some effect on how
national convention delegates will be divided, but only fifteen of
those yield results that can be calculated immediately into
national delegate totals. That leaves the grand totals at 16 states
yielding 712 national convention delegates.
   The Democrats aren't a lot easier to figure out. The 21 states
and territories holding Super Tuesday events have 1,455 delegates.
But 148 of them are a special type of delegate not affected by what
happens in the primaries or caucuses. That leaves 1,307 Democratic
delegates at stake on March 8.
   To complicate matters further, Minnesota's Democrats, who held
their caucuses on Feb. 23, are releasing the results on March 8.
This is an outgrowth of a convoluted compromise between the state
and national parties to allow Minnesota to hold caucuses two weeks
earlier than allowed by the rules without breaking the rules. These
results will govern who wins 78 of the state's national convention
delegates.
   In both parties, a state's national convention delegates are
chosen both on the basis of how much support a presidential
candidate has in each congressional district and how much support
the candidate commands statewide.
   Democrats require that a presidential candidate reaches a
certain level of support to be eligible for winning delegates. Each
candidate must receive at least 15 percent of the vote in any given
congressional district or statewide.
   The corresponding Republican requirements vary from state to
state.
   Here is a state-by-state breakdown of how the delegates will be
calculated from Super Tuesday's events:
   _ Alabama: People running for 37 seats as delegates to the
Democratic National Convention will be listed on the ballot in the
primary along with the presidential candidate they support. Another
19 Democratic delegates will be picked later, but the results of
the primary govern how they will be awarded to presidential
candidates. The Republicans, too, list their delegates on the
ballot _ three in each of seven congressional district and 17
statewide. These are awarded on a winner-take-all basis in each
district and statewide. Total: 56 Democrats, 38 Republicans.
   _ American Samoa: The Democrats gather in one spot and pick six
people who will each cast one-half vote at the national convention.
The Republican Party does not provide for a delegation from
American Samoa. Super Tuesday total: 3 Democrats, 0 Republicans.
   _ Arkansas: The Democrats vote in the primary for presidential
candidates, and delegates will be awarded in proportion to these
results. The Republicans, too, award their national convention
delegates in proportion to the primary results. Super Tuesday
total: 38 Democrats, 27 Republicans.
   _ Florida: In each of the state's 19 congressional districts,
the presidential candidate receiving the most votes in the primary
gets one delegate as a bonus, while the remaining delegates are
divided in proportion to the vote. Statewide, another 47 delegates
will be awarded in prortion to the overall vote. The Republicans
use a somewhat simpler method: The winner in each congressional
district gets all of the delegates from that district, and the
winner statewide receives all 18 of the at-large delegates. Super
Tuesday total: 136 Democrats, 82 Republicans.
   _ Georgia: The Democrats use rules similar to those in Florida:
a ``bonus delegate'' awarded to the winner in each congressional
district, the rest allocated proportionally. The Republicans also
use the same kind of rules as the Florida GOP: winner-take-all by
congressional district and statewide. Super Tuesday total: 77
Democrats, 48 Republicans.
   _ Hawaii: The Democrats hold precinct caucuses to elect
delegates to the state convention. The people attending the
caucuses will register their presidential preference, and the
national convention delegates will be awarded to presidential
candidates in proportion to those results. Hawaii's Republicans
held their precinct caucuses last month. However, in this as well
as other GOP caucus systems, the presidential preferences of the
people at the first step of the process do not in any formal way
bind those who attend the following steps. In addition, the
conventions and caucuses later in the process need not follow any
uniform set of rules. Thus, the number of national convention
delegates won by each presidential candidate cannot be figured with
precision based only on the results of the first step. Super
Tuesday total: 20 Democrats, 0 Republicans.
   _ Idaho: The Democrats hold caucuses similar to those in Hawaii,
picking delegates to the state convention in June, when the
national convention delegates will finally be selected. The
allocation of those delegates among the presidential candidates
will be governed by the support registered by those attending the
March 8 caucuses. Idaho Republicans hold a primary on May 24. Super
Tuesday total: 18 Democrats, 0 Republicans.
   _ Kentucky: Both the Democrats and Republicans divide their
national convention delegates among the presidential candidates in
proportion to the results of the primary. Super Tuesday total: 55
Democrats, 38 Republicans.

   _ Louisiana: The Democrats divide their delegates in proportion
to the results of the primary. The Republicans award 24 of their
delegates on a winner-take-all basis in each of the state's eight
congressional districts. The remaining 17 GOP delegates from
Louisiana are awarded in proportion to the results of the primary
statewide. Super Tuesday total: 63 Democrats, 41 Republicans.
   _ Maryland: The Democrats elect 44 delegates listed on the
ballot by congressional districts and award another 23 delegates in
proportion to the statewide results of the primary. The Republicans
award their delegates on a winner-take-all basis by congressional
district and statewide. Super Tuesday total: 67 Democrats, 41
Republicans.
   _ Massachusetts: The Democrats use a system similar to that of
Georgia and Florida, awarding a ``bonus delegate'' to the
presidential candidate who wins in each congressional district and
dividing the rest proportionally. The Republicans award their
delegates in proportion to the results of the primary. Super
Tuesday total: 98 Democrats, 52 Republicans.
   _ Mississippi: The Democrats award their delegates in proportion
to the results of the primary, both by congressional district and
statewide. The Republicans divide their statewide delegates
proportionally, while those from congressional districts are
awarded on a winner-take-all basis. Super Tuesday total: 40
Democrats, 31 Republicans.
   _ Missouri: The Democrats award their national convention
delegates in proportion to the results of the primary, with a
``bonus delegate'' given in each of the state's nine congressional
districts to the presidential candidate carrying that district. GOP
presidential candidates win delegates in proportion to the results
of the primary. Super Tuesday total: 77 Democrats, 47 Republicans.
   _ Nevada: Democrats meet in precinct caucuses to choose
delegates to the county conventions to pick delegates to the state
convention where the delegates to the national convention will be
selected.
   Participants at each level of the process are required to
declare whom they support for president, and this governs how the
national convention delegates are to be divided among the
presidential candidates. The Republicans had their precinct
caucuses last month, but the final outcome will not be known until
the national convention delegates are chosen in April. Super
Tuesday total: 16 Democrats, 0 Republicans.
   _ North Carolina: Democrats use a ``bonus delegate'' system in
the congressional districts and award the 29 at-large delegates in
proportion to the statewide primary vote. The Republican delegates
are awarded to presidential candidates in proportion to the primary
vote. Super Tuesday total: 82 Democrats, 54 Republicans.
   _ Oklahoma: The Democrats allocate their delegates in proportion
to the results of the primary. The Republicans award their
delegates, winner-take-all, by congressional district and
statewide. Super Tuesday total: 46 Democrats, 36 Republicans.
   _ Rhode Island: Democratic and Republican presidential
candidates win delegates in proportion to how well they do in the
primary. Super Tuesday total: 22 Democrats, 21 Republicans.
   _ Tennessee: The Democrats divide their delegates proportionally
based on the results of the primary. The Republicans elect 33 of
their delegates directly from the ballot by congressional district
and award another dozen based on the statewide vote. Super Tuesday
total: 70 Democrats, 45 Republicans.
   _ Texas: The results of the primary by congressional district
govern the proportional allocation of 119 of the Democratic
delegates from Texas, but there's a twist in how the remaining 64
delegates statewide are picked. In Texas, Democrats who vote in the
primary can also take part in precinct party caucuses held after
the polls close. In many cases, this would require people to make
two trips to the polls in one day. The at-large delegates will be
awarded to presidential candidates based on the preferences of the
people attending the caucuses. The Republicans award their
delegates on a winner-take-all basis by congressional district and
statewide. Super Tuesday total: 183 Democrats, 111 Republicans.
   _ Virginia: Democrats award their delegates in proportion to the
results of the primary. Republicans also are holding a primary, but
its results have no effect at all on who eventually wins the
delegates. That will be handled through a system of caucuses and
conventions concluding in May and June. Super Tuesday total: 75
Democrats, 0 Republicans.
   _ Washington: The Democrats hold precinct caucuses similar to
those in Nevada, and allocation of national convention delegates
will reflect the presidential preferences of the participants.
Republicans also are holding precinct caucuses and will cast votes
for presidential candidates in a non-binding straw poll. However,
just as in other GOP caucus states the delegate allocation cannot
be calculated until the delegates themselves are chosen later in
the season. Super Tuesday total: 65 Democrats, 0 Republicans.

<HEAD>Church Calls Special General Presbytery Session On Evangelist</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with denomination leaders to turn matter over
to third organization.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Assemblies of God, who
are at odds with their Louisiana district over the discipline of
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, said today the denomination's
policy-making body will have the final say.
   A statement from the headquarters of the pentecostal
denomination said the Executive Presbytery of the church's General
Council has called a special meeting of the General Presbytery for
March 28 ``to make decisions regarding matters relating to
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart.''
   ``The 250-member General Presbytery is the policy-making body
for the church when the General Council is not in session, and
serves as a court of appeals in matters relating to ministerial
credentials,'' the statement said. ``Its decisions are final.''
   The next regularly scheduled meeting of the 13-member Executive
Presbytery is March 29.
   Swaggart, in a tearful admission at his headquarters in Baton
Rouge, La., a week ago Sunday, acknowledged he was guilty of
unspecified sin, begging forgiveness. He was reportedly caught with
a prostitute at a New Orleans area motel by rival evangelist Marvin
Gorman last October.
   Swaggart heads a ministry based in Baton Rouge that takes in
nearly $150 million a year to support broadcasts in almost 150
countries and a Bible college.
   The Louisiana District presbyters of the Assemblies of God, the
nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, recommended that
Swaggart be suspended from the pulpit for three months. But after
complaints that that was too lenient, the Executive Presbyters of
the Springfield-based church referred the matter back to the
district level for reconsideration.
   On Monday, the district leaders decided to stand by their
recommendation.
   The Rev. Gerald Lewis, a member of the church's Louisiana
District Council, was quoted by The News-Leader in Springfield
today as saying the council decided Monday to stand by its original
recommendation to suspend Swaggart from the pulpit for three months
after ``there was an interpretation'' of a message received in
tongues.
   Pentecostals believe in tangible manifestations of the Holy
Spirit such as speaking in ``unknown tongues.''
   ``I don't think there was a person on the board that was not
weeping,'' said Lewis, a cousin of Swaggart, referring to the
nine-hour council meeting.
   Juleen Turnage, spokeswoman for the Assemblies of God, said
today that the church would have no further statements on Swaggart
until after the General Presbytery meets.
   In New Orleans later today, a $90 million lawsuit filed against
Swaggart and others by Gorman, who claims Swaggart defamed him with
charges of adultery, is scheduled for a hearing on Gorman's appeal
of the dismissal of the suit.
   Swaggart has been unavailable for comment this week, and there
was no indication he would appear in public for the court hearing.
   A state judge threw out Gorman's suit last summer, saying it was
a religious dispute. Gorman turned to a state appeals court, which
agreed to hear arguments.
   Gorman admitted ``an immoral act'' with a woman in 1979, but
denied other affairs as claimed by Swaggart. Gorman resigned as
minister of the First Assembly of God Church of New Orleans. He
continues to lead Marvin Gorman Ministries at his television studio.

   He pronounces y'all as two distinct words,
but George Bush speaks the language of the South in a way that
overcomes his New England accent. It can be summed up in two other
words: Ronald Reagan.
   With the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses offering 712
delegates, a majority of them in the South, polls indicate Bush
could end the day with a big lead in the race for the Republican
presidential nomination.
   And during a hectic campaign schedule this week, including 10
stops in five Southern states Tuesday and Wednesday, Bush exuded
confidence as he predicted Tuesday's winner will be the next
president.
   ``He's in a very upbeat mood,'' said Bush spokesman Peter
Teeley. ``When you consider what we went through the last four or
five days of New Hampshire. ...''
   Teeley meant a period when it seemed Sen. Bob Dole might follow
his Iowa victory by beating Bush in the New Hampshire primary.
Bush's Feb. 16 victory changed all that, giving him momentum to go
with his strong organization as he headed south.
   And he hoped to benefit from the president's popularity.
   Throughout his Southern swing this week, Bush referred to ``the
Reagan-Bush administration'' and said he was the man who could
build upon ``the superb foundation of the Reagan revolution.'' He
criticized other candidates for differing with the president on
some issues and for criticizing Bush as a yes man.
   ``If the price of winning this nomination is to turn my back in
some way on Ronald Reagan, then I'm not willing to pay that
price,'' Bush said in Tampa.
   ``You Mississippians also know that loyalty is a strength,''
Bush told shipyard workers in Pascagoula, Miss.
   Lanny Griffith, Bush's Southern campaign coordinator from
Corinth, Miss., said rivals' attacks on Bush were unlikely to
succeed in the South.
   ``People here think of George Bush as Reagan's partner, a war
hero, the former CIA director, and as a Texan,'' Griffith said.
``They don't pay attention to that D.C.-New York type of stuff.
`Doonesbury' does not shape the conventional wisdom here.''
   Bush has important advantages in the two largest Super Tuesday
states, Texas and Florida. He made his mark in the Texas oil
business and entered politics there.
   In Florida, he has the support of Gov. Bob Martinez, who
appointed Bush's son, Jeb, as Florida's secretary of commerce. The
younger Bush formerly headed the Dade County Republican Party.
Bush's mother lives in Palm Beach, and the vice president has
visited Florida often, both for personal reasons and on such
official business as his role heading the South Florida Task Force
on Drugs.
   As he campaigned energetically this week, Bush said Dole-leaning
New Hampshire polls preceding Bush's victory there had taught him a
lesson.
   ``You have to continue to fight like you're behind,'' Bush said.
``So you don't let up, you don't go home, and you stay out of the
mud.''
   Bush said he was waging a positive campaign on a ``higher
plain,'' while making indirect jabs at his opponents by calling
himself the most stable and most mature candidate.
   The Bush campaign's officials said they had been outspent in
much of the South but were ready for a final television blitz.
   ``I believe that you should hold back everything you can to
spend as late as possible,'' said Southern coordinator Griffith.
   Bush's late campaigning was concentrated on pockets in the South
where it seemed former television evangelist Pat Robertson had
strong grass-roots support or where Dole was most active.
   In the Deep South states, Bush expected to capitalize on the
administration's stand for strong defense and tough foreign policy.
   He often sprinkled in references to his Navy World War II combat
experience. In case anyone missed them, he was greeted upon arrival
in Tampa with a Grumman Avenger plane, like the one he flew. Bush
put on a flight jacket and climbed into the cockpit for the cameras.
   His strong organization and the advantage of Secret
Service-aided logistics helped allow Bush to pack many appearances
into his swing _ driving a paving machine at a North Miami Beach
construction site, playing shuffleboard with retirees in Boca
Raton, Fla., serving catfish in Biloxi and jambalaya in Baton
Rouge, La.
   The dean of American conservatives, 1964 presidential nominee
Barry Goldwater, campaigned with him in Florida and filmed an
endorsement commercial. Former Navy Secretary John Lehman also
campaigned with Bush in the South.

   The Duke and Duchess of York spent a jovial
day among the arts and artists, joking with conductor Andre Previn
following a concert by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and
laughing with artist David Hockney.
   Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, spent Wednesday evening at
the Music Center listening to the two-hour concert that included a
work by their countryman, Ralph Vaughan Williams.
   The duke and duchess, both 28, were scheduled to visit the
aircraft carrier USS Nimitz today, the seventh day of their 10-day
visit as patrons of the UK@LA '88 arts festival.
   The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier sailed from San Diego at 7
a.m. for the noon rendezvous.
   The Navy planned a fly-by of A-7 jets breaking the sound
barrier, demonstrations of catapault launches and recovery of
aircraft and a lunch that included asparagus soup, marinated
mushrooms, chicken salad and cherries jubilee.
   The prince, who is a Royal Navy officer and helicopter pilot who
saw action in Britain's Falkland Islands war, was to be catapaulted
from the carrier's deck aboard an S-3A Viking anti-submarine
warfare jet.
   On Wednesday, the duchess, who is expecting her first child in
August, was given a bouquet of lavendar roses sporting a white
stork and balloon that read ``Special Delivery'' when she arrived
for the concert.
   Sarah wore a calf-length jade-green gown, contrasting with her
red hair pulled to the side with a flower hair ornament.
   Afterward, the royal couple chatted with Previn and his wife,
Heather. The conversation ended in laughter, as they joked about
the fierce facial expressions conductors sometimes wear.
   So far, the couple known popularly as Andy and Fergie have
hobnobbed with Hollywood celebrities and local business and
political leaders and taken a backstage look at a movie
special-effects studio.
   Earlier in the day, Andrew greeted American investors for a
five-hour cruise aboard Her Majesty's Yacht Britannia by quipping,
``Please don't sink her when you go to sea. Bon Voyage.''
   Andrew also expressed his appreciation for Wednesday's sunny
skies, which followed days of rain during their visit.
   ``We thank you for the weather, for as you know, when the queen
and the royal family comes to pay a visit the weather gets
dreadful,'' Andrew said.
   To the delight of Americans, the duchess dropped her regal
composure a few hours later outside the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art.
   ``Check these out!'' she called out, flouncing about to show the
crowds her hair tied in a loose ponytail and held by clips shaped
like the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes.
   Sarah wore a purple knee-length skirt and matching blazer with
tan shoes to Wednesday's museum visit. The prince wore a gray suit,
pale green shirt and dark green tie.
   At the museum, Hockney met them beneath two of his works, the
giant paintings ``Les Mamille,'' a depiction of a harbor done for
an opera set, and ``A Walk Around the Courtyard, Acatlan.''
   Hockney and museum officials led the couple through the
retrospective show, which includes 150 paintings, 60 drawings and
30 photographs.

<HEAD>Armed Men Rob Van of $1.7 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen burst into the home of a security guard and
his wife, then used them as hostages in a ``meticulously planned
raid'' to steal up to $1.7 million from an armored van, according
to Scotland Yard and a published report.
   The robbery began Tuesday night when two men with pistols took a
Security Express guard and his wife hostage at their southeastern
London home, said a Scotland Yard spokeswoman.
   A third man arrived at the house Wednesday morning and drove the
woman away, she said, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom.
   The two remaining robbers drove the guard to work in his own car
and ordered him to drive his money-laden van to a south London
location, the spokeswoman said.
   The guard explained his predicament to two other guards in the
van and they drove to the prearranged meeting point, she said.
   Two men on motorcycles met the van and ordered the guards to
drive to a nearby soccer field, she said. The guards were ordered
to lie beneath stands in the stadium along with three gardeners who
had seen one of the robbers, she said.
   Minutes later they were joined by the guard's wife and held at
gunpoint until the van's cash was loaded onto another vehicle and
the robbers escaped, the spokeswoman said.
   ``This was a very meticulously planned raid. The raiders had
obviously been following the movements of the guard for many days
and knew where to find him,'' one of her male colleagues at
Scotland Yard added later.
   Police refused to say how much cash was taken, but the Times of
London on Thursday quoted unidentified police sources as saying the
gang got away with between $1.32 million and $1.76 million.

<HEAD>Census Adjustment Decision Attacked On Capitol Hill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's decision not to
adjust the 1990 national census to allow for people who are
overlooked was ``shameful'' and blatantly political, a New York
congressman charged Thursday.
   The action was not based ``on fairminded concern about accurate
statistics; it's a raw exercise of partisan politics,'' Rep.
Charles E. Schumer charged at a hearing of the House Post Office
and Civil Service census subcommittee.
   Schumer and Reps. Mervyn M. Dymally of California and Robert
Garcia of New York all raised concern about the decision not to
adjust, which was announced last October by the Commerce
Department, parent agency of the census. All three are Democrats.
   Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner denied that it was a
political decision, however, contending that statisticians disagree
on whether there is an accurate method of making adjustments.
   ``I don't think it would make the problem any better if we were
to devise an elaborate mathematical system to make up new
numbers,'' Ortner commented.
   The focus of the problem is the fact that all 435 seats in the
House of Representatives and billions of dollars in state and
federal money are distributed on the basis of the figures collected
every 10 years by the Census Bureau.
   No head count can be perfect in a nation the size of the United
States, with the current population estimated at more than 244
million people. But concern centers on studies that show that the
number of people missed is much higher among minorities.
   That results in such groups as blacks and Hispanics getting less
economic and political clout, and has led to calls for an
adjustment of census figures to compensate for this problem.
   Census statisticians have been working on finding a way to
adjust the figures, but disagreement exists as to whether this can
be done in an accurate fashion.
   Thus, Ortner announced last fall that no adjustment would be
made in 1990, stating that the time for experimenting was over and
the agency had go get on with the task of taking the census.
   That drew a barrage of criticism, however, from groups
contending that those most often missed are urban minorities,
usually Democrats, and that the decision not to adjust was a
political action to boost the power of conservatives and
Republicans.
   ``The administration's position is shameful. It's shameful
because the administration's problem with adjusting census figures
is not statisatical, it's political,'' Schumer said.
   ``That's absolutely untrue,'' responded Ortner. He said the
department simply wanted to go out and conduct the best actual
count possible, adding that cuts in post-census surveys which might
have been used to make later adjustments were designed to save
money.
   Dymally commented that he found it interesting that the decision
not to make an adjustment was made by Commerce Department officials
just 10 days after he proposed a bill to require an adjustment.
   The decision should have been left up to xensus statisticians
rather than being made by Commerce officials, he added.
   Schumer pointed out that Barbara Bailar, a census official who
had been in charge of developing adjustment methods, resigned from
the agency charging that the decision was political rather than
technical.
   Bailar said in her prepared testimony that while opinion was
divided in the bureau, she believed that the census figures could
be accurately adjusted using a survey of residents on specific
areas to estimate the undercount.
   But Ortner reiterated that statisticians continue to disagree on
the matter and presented a letter from about a dozen academic
popualation experts opposed to making adjustments in the census
counts.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs $1.30 Boost in Minimum Wage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Democratic-controlled House labor
standards subcommittee voted along party lines Thursday to increase
the minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.65 an hour over the next three
years.
   The 6-3 vote came after Democrats defeated Republican amendments
designed to either water down or kill the measure, which would
raise the minimum wage 50 cents an hour on Jan. 1, 1989 and 40
cents an hour each of the following years.
   However, the subcommittee refused, 7-2, to tie future increases
to inflation, a proposal once wanted by organized labor but which
it abandoned in an effort to preserve the $4.65-an-hour figure.
   Rep. Timothy J. Penny, D-Minn., who proposed the elimination of
the indexing of future increases, said he was ``concerned about
something like this being on automatic pilot. Congress should
review an future increases.'' He also said automatic increases in
the minimum wage would could drive up salaries of workers who make
higher than the minimum, leading to inflation.
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the full House
Labor and Education Committee, voted against the Penny amendment,
saying it ``is ill-timed, unwarranted and not justified by the
facts. There is no indication that it leads to inflation. Wages lag
behind inflation and will always do as long as they are based on
past experience.''
   Hawkins said the full committee would take up the measure next
Thursday.
   A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Labor and Human Resources
Committee. That panel has held hearings on the proposal but has not
scheduled further action on it.
   The House subcommittee rejected, 6-3, a substitute measure
proposed by Rep. Thomas E. Petri, R-Wis., that would have raised
the minimum wage to $4 an hour over the next three years.
   Rep. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., offered an amendment to increase
the ``tip credit'' for restaurant workers, it also lost, 6-3, after
Rep. Tommy F. Robinson, D-Ark., said he planned to introduce a
similar bill when the full committee meets next week and had worked
out a deal with Hawkins to do so.
   The restaurant industry wants to be able to count a waiter's
tips as a credit toward half the minimum wage requirement. Labor
and Hawkins are opposed to the proposal, but Robinson said he
believed he had enough votes in the full committee to pass it.
   The panel also defeated, 6-3, an amendment by Steve Bartlett,
R-Texas, to create what he called training wage of $3.35 an hour
for a 180-day period during which an employer can teach a new
worker.
   Hawkins said the proposal was nothing more than a ``subminimum
wage'' that had been rejected by Congress many times in the past.
``How long does it take a youngster to learn how to flip a
hamburger?'' he asked.
   Voting for the minimum wage increase were Reps. Hawkins, Penny,
Robinson, subcommittee chairman Austin J. Murphy, D-Pa.; Pat
Williams, D-Mont., and Robert E. Wise Jr., D-W.Va. Voting against
it were Petri, Jeffords and Bartlett.
   The minimum wage was raised to $3.35 an hour in 1981 from $3.10.

<HEAD>IRS Seeks $6 Million From Estate of Late Rep. Larry McDonald</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The estate of the late Rep. Larry McDonald,
who died in 1983 when a Korean Air Lines plane was shot down by a
Soviet fighter jet, is challenging an IRS claim for $6.1 million in
taxes.
   The key dispute is the contention by the Internal Revenue
Service that the value of the estate should include $10 million in
punitive damages and $2 million for pain and suffering that are
being sought in litigation against the airline. No damages have
been awarded.
   The Georgia Democrat's widow, Kathryn J. McDonald, the
administrator of the estate, filed suit in U.S. Tax Court to
protest the IRS claim.
   Her petition says that because the damage suit against the
airline is controlled by international law, no punitive damages are
possible.
   ``No recovery has been made for any damages relating to the
decedent's pain and suffering, and ultimate recovery is doubtful,''
said the peition, which was filed Jan. 21.
   McDonald was among 269 people who died when the KAL jumbo jet
was shot down after passing through Soviet airspace on Sept. 1,
1983, while flying from Anchorage, Alaska, to Seoul.

   Eddie ``The Eagle'' Edwards, the
scrappy ski-jumper who became the superstar loser at the Winter
Olympics, came home Thursday in a white Rolls-Royce to the cheers
of crowds.
   About 3,000 townsfolk waving ``Welcome Home Eddie'' flags lined
downtown streets for more than an hour to catch a glimpse of the
24-year-old who left home an unknown plasterer and returned a
celebrity.
   ``It's great to be back home and I'm just staggered by everyone
turning out to welcome me in the town,'' said Edwards. He finished
last in his two events but won over Olympic crowds with his
ever-ready smile and often-bumbling antics.
   He flew back from Calgary on Tuesday but spent two days in
London saying he had to sort out offers from manufacturers, movie
moguls, publishers and a vodka distiller.
   His parents, sister and brother greeted him wearing ``I Love
Eddie'' sweaters knitted by his 80-year-old grandmother.
   ``After all the fuss he has had around the world, he is still a
home-loving boy,'' said his mother, Janette. ``He's coping well
with it all.''

   Bertha Lugar Caldwell, 81, was last seen driving her car late

   ``We assume that she was driving around and got disoriented,''

   Fisher said a doctor probably would examine Mrs. Caldwell in

   Rain, freezing rain and sleet pelted the area during the night.

   More than 21,000 rock fans have signed
their names to a pink Cadillac in an unusual petition drive to get
Bruce Springsteen to schedule a stop here on his ``Tunnel of Love''
tour.
   But Berry Bell of Premier Talent, Springsteen's New York booking
agency, said Rockford's 10,000-seat Metro Centre couldn't hold such
a concert.
   ``Your building is too small. ... Besides, he's booked through
the end of May,'' Bell said.
   Radio station WZOK bought the 1968 car and had it painted pink
in honor of ``Pink Cadillac,'' an early Springsteen hit.
   Mark McClure, operations manager at the station, said
Springsteen's tour, which began last week in Worcester, Mass., will
stop in suburban Chicago on March 16-17 and won't resume until
March 22 in Atlanta.
   ``He's got a five-day window between Chicago and Atlanta,'' he
said. ``But we say, `Come anytime you want.'''
   McClure plans to drive to Philadelphia on Monday when
Springsteen performs at The Spectrum there and park the
signature-decorated car near the back stage door. A similar
promotion, he said, persuaded the Rolling Stones to play Rockford
in 1981.

the New Jersey Democrat told Parade magazine, which said his skills

   Despite continuing speculation of a presidential draft, Bradley

   The newly crowned Miss USA said Thursday that
the ``astronomical'' odds she faced in her bid to become the fourth
straight Miss Texas to win the title provided the extra push she
needed.
   At a Manhattan news conference, Courtney Gibbs said of her
beauty pageant win, ``I've been extremely overwhelmed, very numb.
It's just starting to settle in as I open up newspapers or turn on
the television.''
   The 21-year-old college student and model was crowned Tuesday in
the nationally televised event staged in El Paso, Texas.
   Miss Gibbs' win marked the fourth year in a row that a Texas
woman has won the event, prompting a stunned pageant spokeswoman,
Stacy Sacco, to assure reporters that the contest was not rigged.
   On Thursday, Miss Gibbs, a junior at Texas Christian University,
said that going into the pageant the computer-generated odds were
``something astronomical'' against another Texas woman winning.
   ``I think just that little bit of challenge, that little bit of
extra `you can't' really gave me the push to think that I could.''
   Miss Gibbs, an aspiring actress, will represent the United
States in the Miss Universe pageant May 23 in Taipei, Taiwan.

   ``Economic considerations also had an important role in the

   It used to be easy to handicap the Grammys. But
as the music industry awards moved into their third decade, they
proved they can pack some surprises.
   Take Michael Jackson, for example.
   Four years ago, he nabbed a record eight Grammys with his
``Thriller'' LP. At the 30th Annual Grammy Awards on Wednesday
night, he was a big loser. He was nominated for four Grammys and he
didn't win any, though his engineers won for their work on his
album, ``Bad.''
   The Irish quartet U2, with their introspective songs of
humanity, were expected to sweep the National Academy of Recording
Arts & Sciences awards for their 12 million-seller LP, ``The Joshua
Tree.''
   The group was nominated for four Grammys and won two, including
album of the year. ``I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For''
lost song of the year honors to ``Somewhere Out There,'' a sweet
song from an animated mouse movie, and lost record of the year to
Paul Simon's title track from last year's Grammy-winning
``Graceland'' LP.
   The ``Graceland'' single was released within the Oct. 1, 1986 to
Sept. 30, 1987 eligibility year to qualify for this year's awards.
   Simon wasn't at Radio City Music Hall to collect his trophy, nor
to see Ladysmith Black Mambazo, his collaborators on the South
African-inspired ``Graceland'' album, win a Grammy for their own
``Shaka Zulu'' collection, which Simon produced.
   Robert Shaw and the Atlanta Symphony Chorus and Orchestra won
more Grammys than the rock and pop stars who usually make the
headlines. Their recording of requiems by Gabriel Faure and Maurice
Durufle won awards for best engineered classical recording and for
producer Robert Woods. The Atlanta group's recording of Paul
Hindemith's ``When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd'' won as
best choral performance.
   There were more surprises: Sting beat Jackson and Bruce
Springsteen as best male pop vocalist for his album ``Bring on the
Night''; veteran rocker Frank Zappa zapped Springsteen and Stevie
Ray Vaughan as best rock instrumentalist for his LP ``Jazz From
Hell''; Smokey Robinson topped Jackson and Stevie Wonder as best
rhythm 'n' blues male vocalist for his single, ``Just to See Her.''
   And Suzanne Vega, whose soliloquy of an abused child touched
listeners throughout the world, won nothing for the song ``Luka.''
She had three nominations, including song and record of the year.
   ``I was hoping it would win, but I was prepared for anything to
happen,'' she said backstage. ``I'm a little disappointed I guess.''
   It wasn't surprising that Whitney Houston was chosen best female
pop vocalist for her single ``I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who
Loves Me)'' or that Springsteen was chosen best rock vocalist for
his album, ``Tunnel of Love.''
   But one of the evening's biggest surprises and best moments came
from a presenter _ the strutting, screaming and outrageous Little
Richard. He stole the show and held it captive for a few hilarious
minutes when he declared he had won the prize for best new artist.
The award really went to Jody Watley.
   ``I have never received nuthin'. Y'all ain't never gave me no
Grammys, and I've been singing for 30 years,'' declared the man who
sang ``Tutti Frutti'' and ``Good Golly, Miss Molly.''
   ``I am the architect of rock 'n' roll,'' he shouted, and the
crowd jumped to its feet and roared approval.
   Bill Medley, who never won a Grammy with Bobby Hatfield as the
Righteous Brothers and said he'd ``been waiting 26 years for one of
these suckers,'' won with Jennifer Warnes. Their duet, ``(I've Had)
the Time of My Life,'' from the ``Dirty Dancing'' soundtrack, was
named best pop vocal performance by a duo or group.
   Aretha Franklin became the woman who owns the most Grammys,
moving ahead of Leontyne Price and Ella Fitzgerald, by winning two
this year for a total of 14. She won as best female rhythm 'n'
blues vocalist for her album ``Aretha,'' and with George Michael as
best rhythm 'n' blues duo or group for ``I Knew You Were Waiting
(for Me),'' a track from ``Aretha.''
   Diane Schuur won over jazz veterans Carmen McRae, Sarah Vaughan
and Ella Fitzgerald, and Manhattan Transfer's Janis Siegel, named
best female jazz vocalist with her critically acclaimed LP, ``Diane
Schuur and the Count Basie Orchestra.''
   The late Duke Ellington was represented by ``Digital Duke,'' the
Ellington Band conducted by Mercer Ellington.
   ``I felt Pop over my shoulder the whole time in the studio,''
Mercer Ellington said backstage.
   Posthumous albums won in two categories. ``Unfinished Business''
by Steve Goodman, who died of leukemia, won as best contemporary
folk record. Peter Tosh, slain in his Jamaica home last year during
a robbery, had recorded ``No Nuclear War,'' which won in the reggae
category.
   In classical categories, the Chicago Symphony's music director,
Sir Georg Solti, winner of more Grammys than anybody, added another
to his collection of 25, when ``Beethoven: Symphony No. 9'' was
named best orchestral recording.
   Pianist Vladimir Horowitz, who had been tied for second place
with Henry Mancini with 20 Grammys, pulled ahead. He picked up the
best classical album Grammy for ``Horowitz in Moscow.'' The record
was also named best classical instrumental solo performance without
orchestra.
   Violinist Itzhak Perlman received two Grammys, for best solo
instrumental with orchestra, for ``Mozart: Violin Concertos 2 and
4'' and, with cellist Lynn Harrell and pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy,
for best chamber performance, for ``Beethoven: the Complete Piano
Trios.''
   Soprano Kathleen Battle also received two. Her ``Kathleen Battle
_ Salzburg Recital'' won as best vocal solo performance and she was
a principal soloist on Strauss' ``Ariadne auf Naxos,'' which won as
best opera recording. Miss Battle was a featured soloist on four of
the five opera recordings that were nominated.

<TEXT>
   A film about an American adventurer
who took over Nicaragua more than 100 years ago was a box-office
flop in the United States, but it has been drawing long lines in
Managua.
   A downtown movie house has been packed since the film ``Walker''
opened Feb. 25. That's an unusual occurrence because the $5 tickets
cost more than many workers earn in a day.
   Moviegoers said they were curious and eager to see the scenes of
Granada, the central colonial city on the shores of Lake Nicaragua
where most of the film was shot last year.
   The movie, directed by Briton Alex Cox for Universal Pictures,
is about William Walker, a 19th century American adventurer who is
little-known in the United States but featured in every child's
history book in Nicaragua. The satirical film stars Ed Harris as
Walker nd Academy Award-winner Marlee Matlin as his
hearing-impaired wife.
   Walker is seen here as the first invader from the United States,
the man who started more than 100 years of U.S. intervention and a
symbol of Yankee imperialism.
   Walker came to Nicaragua in 1855 and after capturing Granada,
named himself president the following year. He offered an uneasy
warning of today's friction between Nicaragua and the United States
by saying, ``We'll be back, time and time again.''
   Walker surrendered to the U.S. Navy in 1857, tried to conquer
Central American in 1860 and was finally turned over to Honduras.
He was executed by firing squad in 1860.
   Reviews so far have been mixed.
   Roberto Fonseca wrote in the culture magazine Ventana that the
film was ``a joke in bad taste.''
   ``It's a shame that we lost the opportunity to make a film, a
work with instructive and political ends,'' Fonseca wrote.
   He noted that the film contained unnecessary violence and was
``extemely weak not only because of its ommissions but _ voluntary
or not _ for its misrepresentations.''
   The movie starts out by saying that ``This is a true story.''
   But reviewers find scores of factual errors, including the wrong
presidents at the time in Nicaragua and the United States.
   The 20th century props used in the film amused the crowd in the
Teatro Gonzalez movie house and they broke into laughter when
scenes showed contemporary news magazines, a recent model car and a
Soviet-made troop helicopter that was supposed to be carrying U.S.
government officials.
   But Fonseca, in his review, said: ``Personally, the
misrepresentations don't make me laugh.''
   The pro-government newspaper Nuevo Diario quoted Roberto Cruz,
described as a movie enthusiast, as saying the ``satire covered up
what Walker means in Nicaragua.''
   Most of the people at the theater hurried out, chatting among
themselves about the film.
   ``I liked it,'' one woman said, pulling the hand of a youngster.
``Why? Well, I like the scenes.''
   A young man, who said he didn't want to give his name, said: ``I
thought it was funny.''
   But another spectator, also declining to give his name, said
simply, ``It was silly.''

   Presidental candidate Michael Dukakis has joined
the literary campaign trail by co-authoring a book that chronicles
development in Massachusetts under his governorship.
   Dukakis wrote only two chapters of ``Creating the Future,'' but
his name is listed ahead of co-author Rosabeth Moss Kanter of the
Harvard Business School on the new $17.95 hardcover book that
explains the secrets of Massachusett's economic success.
   The book may instruct students of economic development policy.
But the average reader could come away thinking that political
campaign books are to books what political campaign food is to food.
   Several other presidential candidates have published books,
ranging from Democrat Gary Hart's novel, ``The Double Man,''
co-authored with Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, to Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole's ``Unlimited Partners,'' written with his wife, former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, and Richard Norton Smith.
   Dukakis' book is neither a novel nor a biography. It has no
plot, poetry or photos. But it is full of recipes _ economic
recipes.
   Resolutely serious, the book focuses on the reversal of
Massachusetts' economic fortunes since Dukakis began his first term
as governor in 1975, when the state's unemployment rate was 12
percent and the state Treasury was more than $500 million in the
red. He lost in 1978 but won two more terms, in 1982 and 1986.
   Dukakis walks a fine line between praising himself and praising
others for what he calls ``the Massachusetts comeback'' or the
``Massachusetts miracle.''
   ``There is a lesson for America in the Massachusetts success
story. It is not that every specific program we tried here will
work everywhere else,'' Dukakis writes.
   ``Rather, the lesson is in the idea of hands-on economic
development and the approach we've used to get it done,'' he says.
The key ingredients were fiscal reform, investments in public
infrastructure, worker training and capital formation, and the
creation of public-private partnerships to encourage innovation.
   In the early stages of his presidential campaign last year,
Dukakis stressed his role in the turnaround that brought lower
taxes, rising personal income and the lowest unemployment rate of
any industrial state.
   Dukakis uses the book to lecture his critics who claim that
Massachusetts has benefited from the Reagan defense build-up.
   ``The world may identify Massachusetts with high technology, and
high technology with defense, but the facts are otherwise,''
Dukakis writes. He maintains that only about 4 percent of
Massachusetts employment depends on defense spending.
   Dukakis is credited as the author of chapters on the state's
comeback and on his now-familiar prescriptions for a national
economic development strategy.
   The bulk of the book was written by Kanter, an expert on
entrepreneurship and an ally of the Dukakis administration. Kanter
said the book grew out of discussions she had with Dukakis in 1986,
well before he decided to run for president.
   ``It might have been me first saying, there's a great story
here. Then his staff picked up on it,'' Kanter said in an interview.
   ``In February (1987) we met and decided a book was a good idea.
That was at his inititative,'' she said.
   According to Kanter, the chapters attributed to Dukakis were
based on speeches and policy statements he had made before, but she
insisted that Dukakis was actively involved in updating, editing
and rewriting them.
   ``He had somewhat less time than we were expecting,'' Kanter
said.
   John DeVillars, the governor's deputy chief of staff, said
Dukakis worked on the book while flying from one campaign stop to
another. ``He probably, in writing the book, traveled 15,000
miles,'' DeVillars said.
   The publisher, Simon and Schuster, refused to divulge any
figures about sales or orders. But if the book makes any money,
Dukakis and Kanter have decided to donate any proceeds to the
state's Adult Literacy Corps.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks Implementation Of Ban On Federally Funded Abortion
Counseling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today blocked implementation of
new Reagan administration regulations designed to cut off federal
funds to family planning clinics which perform abortions or offer
abortion counseling.
   The new regulation, which were scheduled to take effect today,
would have had no immediate impact on the estimated 4,000 family
planning clinics around the nation operated with federal funds
because the rules apply only to new grants.
   U.S. District Judge Walter Jay Skinner issued a permanent
injunction against the Department of Health and Human Services
regulations.
   Skinner said in a 28-page order that the regulations issued last
month by the department ``as a whole violate both congressional
intent and rights protected by the Constitution.''
   It was not immediately clear if the ruling had effect outside
Massachusetts. Federal judges in Denver and New York City earlier
had issued temporary injunctions against implementation of the
rules.
   ``In my opinion, a governmentally imposed block on the flow of
neutral information bearing on abortion is an impermissible burden
on the presently recognized rights of a pregnant client'' of a
family planning clinic.
   Skinner also said the regulations violate First Amendment
protections of free speech for those who advocate abortion
   The injunction was requested last month by the state of
Massachusetts, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health
Association and 13 other local and national family planning groups.
   The new rules would prohibit federally funded family planning
programs from providing abortion counseling, referring women to
abortion providers and engaging in lobbying or legal action to
increase availability of abortion.
   If the facility also performs abortions, to keep federal funding
for its other programs the clinic must maintain separate personnel,
separate accounting procedures, and provide different and clearly
defined waiting and treatment rooms for each type of patient.
   About 4,000 family planning clinics nationwide would be affected
by the regulations.
   In requesting the injunction, the state and the family planning
association told Skinner at a Feb. 17 hearing that the new
regulations were contrary to the intent of Congress when it
established the Family Planning Program under Title X of the Public
Health Service Act in 1970.
   The Title X budget for fiscal 1988 is $137 million, down from
$142 million in fiscal 1987. An estimated 5 million poor women
receive services from the program.
   In Massachusetts, there are 84 clinics serving 87,000 recipients
with the help of a $2.9 million Title X appropriation.

   A government spokesman said Thursday some people
were killed in the southern city of Sumgait during weekend riots,
which he said were provoked by ``hooligans'' reacting to rumors of
ethnic confrontation.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov gave the first
official confirmation of deaths during the riots in the Caucasian
republic of Azerbaijan, but would not say how many people were
killed.
   ``Even one single life lost is already much too much,''
Gerasimov said when asked at a news briefing about a claim by
Armenian dissidents that 17 people were killed at Sumgait, an
industrial city of more than 160,000.
   Trouble between ethnic Azerbaijanis and ethnic Armenians began
early last month with a dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region
just north of Iran and east of Turkey. More than three-quarters of
the population is Armenian but it was made part of neighboring
Azerbaijan in 1923.
   Protesters in Nagorno-Karabakh demanded that it be joined to
Armenia and peaceful protests spread to Yerevan, capital of Soviet
Armenia.
   Riots were reported Sunday in Sumgait, 150 miles from
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   ``A group of mutineers, of hooligans, provoked disorders,''
Gerasimov said. ``These riots involved people who fell for
provocative rumors and instigations with respect to what happened
in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   ``Using the situation of spontaneity, the instigators of
violence participated in actions which led to casualties.''
   He referred at other times in the briefing to loss of life,
indicating the casualties were deaths.
   On Wednesday, an employee of the television station in Baku,
capital of Azerbaijan, said one or two people had been killed in
Sumgait. He spoke in a telephone interview on condition of
anonymity.
   Gerasimov acknowledged that problems also developed in
Kirovabad, another city in Azerbaijan. ``The situation in Kirovabad
is normal, although over there some things might have happened
too,'' he said, but refused to elaborate.
   The television worker said 50-60 young ethnic Azerbaijanis who
live in Armenia traveled to Sumgait last weekend and told relatives
and friends about ethnic confrontations. He said ``young
hooligans'' then went on a rampage and killed people.
   On Thursday, Gerasimov said people were arrested and prosecutors
were investigating. He said order had been restored in Sumgait,
businesses and stores were running normally and the curfew had been
lifted.
   He said two ranking Soviet officials were in Sumgait
``investigating these anti-social manifestations.'' He identified
them as Pyotr N. Demichev, a non-voting member of the national
Communist Party Politburo, and Kyamran Bagirov, first secretary of
the Azerbaijan Central Committee.
   Some ethnic Azerbaijanis had fled their homes, he said.
   ``Influenced by such provocative rumors and rumor-mongering, a
small number of Azerbaijani families left Azerbaijan,'' Gerasimobv
told the journalists. ``They went to their relatives regularly,''
he said, but did not say where they settled.
   The only other confirmed report of deaths in the
Armenian-Azerbaijan unrest was a Soviet prosecutor's comment
Saturday that two people in Agdamsky, a district of Azerbaijan
bordering Nagorno-Karabakh, had been murdered in disorders linked
to the territorial dispute.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed Feb. 26 for calm in
Armenia and Azerbaijan, and said the Communist Party Central
Committee would review the dispute.

   New regulations to deny federal funds to
family-planning organizations that counsel abortion technically go
into effect today, but three court challenges have left the picture
murky.
   Even if the new rules weren't in legal limbo, there would be no
immediate practical impact on the estimated 4,000 family planning
clinics around the nation operated with federal funds.
   That is because the new regulations apply only to new grants.
   All the clinics that might eventually be affected are now
operating with money approved under the old regulations. No new
grant applications are in the final approval stage.
   Federal judges in Denver and New York City have issued temporary
injunctions against implementation of the new rules, but it is not
clear whether they have full nationwide force.
   In Boston today, a third federal judge, Walter Jay Skinner,
issued a permament injunction against the Department of Health and
Human Services blocking implementation of the rules.
   Skinner said the regulations violate Congress' intent and rights
protected by the Constitution.
   ``In my opinion, a governmentally imposed block on the flow of
neutral information bearing on abortion is an impermissible burden
on the presently recognized rights of a pregnant client'' of a
family planning clinic, the judge said.

<HEAD>US Moving Ahead On NATO Nuclear Improvments, Slower On Lance
Replacements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is forging ahead with plans
for better nuclear shells and short-range air-to-surface missiles,
but is moving less rapidly to replace 88 aged ground-launched
rockets, partly out of deference to West Germany, U.S. officials
said Thursday.
   The shells are in development and the air-to-surface missile is
close to that stage, the officials said.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in Washington
as NATO leaders in Brussels ended their two-day summit, said major
decisions remain, however, on how to replace the 75-mile-range,
ground-launched Lance missile.
   Deployment of a replacement for the Lance could come as late as
1995, if ever, they said.
   ``NATO is still committed to the modernization, but there isn't
any decision facing the alliance now on Lance replacement,'' one
official said.
   What to do about short-range systems has become a bigger issue
in NATO, now that a U.S.-Soviet treaty would eliminate missiles
capable of hitting targets 300 to 3,120 miles away. The short-range
arms would be the only nuclear weapons left in Western Europe.
   As promised at a defense ministers' meeting in Montebello,
Canada, in 1983, NATO already has reduced the number of short-range
systems below a 4,600 ceiling. The other half of the Montebello
decision is pending. It calls for:
   _ New, more accurate and reliable artillery shells, notably for
155-millimeter howitzers, capable of hitting targets 10-15 miles
away. Research is finished and that weapon is in the early
development stage.
   _ A new air-to-surface missile with a range of about 350 miles.
The could be in the development stage shortly, especially if a
final decision is reached to simply modify existing air-launched
cruise missiles. The weapons would be deployed on U.S. F-16s,
F-111s, West German Torndados and other fighter-bombers.
   _ A replacement for Lance missile, a 1960s generation weapon
deployed in 1972. There are 88 Lance launchers in Western Europe
and NATO envisions replacing them with equipment capable of firing
a missile about 130 miles. The replacement is in the early design
stage.
   In a summit-ending communique, President Reagan and the other 15
leaders said ``we are determined to sustain the requisite efforts
to ensure the continued viability, credibility and effectiveness of
our conventional and nuclear forces, including the nuclear forces
in Europe which together provide the guarantee of our common
security.''
   The final summit communique avoided use of the word
modernization, to which West Germany objects. Instead, the document
said NATO will maintain ``an appropriate mix of adequate and
effective nuclear and conventional forces which will continue to be
kept up to date where necessary.''
   Of the NATO allies, West Germany is the most concerned about the
pace of modernization. Many political figures there would prefer
less talk about nuclear improvements and more talk about
negotiations with the Soviets to reduce the number of short-range
weapons on both sides.
   In deference to West Germany, officials before and after the
summit took pains to stress the fact that the Lance replacement,
the most powerful of the weapons, has not even been built, much
less set for deployment.
   NATO Secretary General Lord Carrington said the allies were
concerned that some people might think ``modernization'' might
signal introduction of new, more destructive weapons.
``Modernization actually means weapons that are more accurate and
possibly less destructive,'' he said.
   Frank Gaffney, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense
and advocate of rapid-as-possible improvements in the short-range
systems, said Thursday deployment of the new weapons would enhance
the chances of getting an agreement at future arms talks with the
Soviets.
   The Pentagon's 1987 report on Soviet military power said East
bloc forces have ``a substantial numerical superiority'' in
short-range nuclear forces.

   The body of a 9-year-old boy, handcuffed
and naked, was found inside the family's clothes dryer, authorities
said Thursday.
   The death of the boy, James L. Keller, appears to have been
accidental but the investigation was incomplete, said Deputy Police
Chief Robert Pepin.
   He said police were called to the home Wednesday night and
officers found the parents trying to revive the boy.
   ``As near as we can tell,'' said Pepin, ``he had been playing
with a couple of siblings and somehow or other ended up in the
dryer.''
   Kankakee County Coroner James Orrison said there were some burns
on the body, indicating the dryer had been turned on, but that he
had not determined the cause of death.
   Police do not know why the boy was naked and his hands cuffed.
Pepin said the accident happened in the basement while the father
was sleeping and the mother was out of the house.
   Earlier this week, the body of a 12-year-old Humboldt, Wis., boy
was found nude in a portable dishwasher that had been turned on.
Police said the death was apparently accidental but they were
continuing to investigate.

<HEAD>Doctors Find AIDS Virus in Cervix Tissue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors have isolated the AIDS virus from the
cervixes of AIDS-infected women, a discovery that sheds some light
on how the disease is transmitted.
   It may explain how a woman passes on the disease to babies
during birth and to her sex partners, researchers say.
   Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital isolated the virus
from the cervixes of three of four AIDS-infected women.
   ``These findings indicate that there is actually virus within
the cervix tissue itself, and the virus can be secreted'' into the
genital fluids, said Dr. Martin S. Hirsch, senior author of the
report. ``These might be a source of subsequent infection to
others.''
   Experts had known before that infected women can have AIDS virus
in their genital regions, although it was unclear where it came
from.
   ``This shows pretty clearly that the source of the virus within
the genital secretions is actually cells within the cervix,''
Hirsch said in an interview.
   He said the cervix might also be infected directly during
intercourse from contact with virus-laden sperm, although the study
doesn't prove the AIDS virus actually gets into women's bodies this
way.
   The study, directed by Dr. Roger J. Pomerantz, was published in
the March issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.
   The researchers found the virus in endothelial cells that line
blood vessels in the inner layer of the cervix, as well as in
germ-eating macrophages and other blood cells within the cervical
tissue.
   ``It's interesting and raises possibilities that perhaps the
cervix could be infected directly by the virus, rather than get
there through the blood,'' said Dr. Jay A. Levy of the University
of California, San Francisco.
   The new research adds one more site to the growing list of
targets of the AIDS virus, known as HIV.
   The virus kills by destroying helper T-cells, blood cells that
orchestrate the body's immune defenses against all kinds of
microscopic invaders, among them the AIDS virus itself. However,
experts have learned that the virus also infects other types of
blood cells as well as other parts of the body, including the eyes
and the brain.
   Last month, Levy and others published a report showing that the
AIDS virus also infects the rectum and colon. That could explain
one way that the disease is spread during anal intercourse.
   Many experts have assumed that for an AIDS infection to occur,
the virus must enter the bloodstream through a tear in the body's
tissues. The discovery of infected rectal and cervical tissue,
however, suggests this might not always be necessary. Instead,
infection might occur by direct viral contact with the rectum and
the female sex organs.
   ``A local infection of susceptible cervical cells from infected
semen may preceed systemic spread of HIV,'' the researchers wrote.
   Hirsch said he believes, though cannot prove, that the AIDS
virus can penetrate intact cervical tissue, but infection might
occur more readily if the cervix is inflamed by venereal disease.
   About 40 percent of babies born to infected women catch the
virus themselves, either before or during birth. The study raised
the possiblity that delivery by Caesarean section might lower the
risk to the newborn but says there is no proof for this.
   The women tested in the study were all heroin users who likely
got infected from contaminated needles.

<HEAD>City-Owned Railroad Track Disappears _ Ties, Gravel and All</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may not be the great train robbery,
but it could be the great rail theft _ every inch of a 2,000-foot
stretch of city-owned railroad track in Great Falls has disappeared.
   ``They did a good job, too,'' said City Engineer Stu Pearson.
``They took the railroad, the ties and the gravel.''
   Time of the theft is a bit uncertain _ sometime between August
1984 and last week. Value of the stolen track was estimated at
$80,000.
   Pearson said he learned last week the track was missing. He was
notified by the manager of the construction company that laid the
track for the city.
   ``I had to sit down and catch my breath,'' Pearson said. ``I
couldn't believe it was gone. But sure enough, you go up there and
there's not a lick of rail.''
   He has since done some investigating. ``Everybody that I've
talked to ... can remember work going on, but they can't remember
who did it,'' he said.
   The track spur, installed in 1978, extended from the Burlington
Northern Railroad's main line into an industrial park that is now
partially occupied.
   The problem is serious, Pearson said, because rail service is an
important factor in selling lots in the industrial park. Although
the spur obviously had not been used much in the last few years, it
may be needed when the economy improves, he said.
   Pearson said he has asked officials from the BN and Milwaukee
Road railroads to check records to determine whether their workers
removed the track by mistake. He has yet to receive a response.
   The cost to replace the track would be about $160,000, he
estimated, but the city has no plans to do so yet.

   Early immigrants to the United States will be
honored at a special stamp ceremony involving Sweden and Finland on
March 29, the U.S. Postal Service said Thursday.
   The occasion is the settlement 350 years ago of New Sweden _ in
what is now Delaware _ by immigrants from those northern European
nations.
   A stamp dedication ceremony will be held in the Grand Opera
House in Wilmington, Del., where the issuance of a 44-cent U.S.
airmail stamp will be marked.
   At the same time, stamps commemorating the same settlement will
also be issued in Helsinki, Finland, and Vaxjo, Sweden.

<HEAD>Caseworker's Hunch Brings Reunion Of Kidnapped Boy And Mother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MESQUITE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hunch by a caseworker led to a tearful
reunion of a mother with her 15-month-old son who was kidnapped
when he was 18 days old.
   Alisha Wetselline-Rodriguez held her son, Eric, on Wednesday and
was so excited she could barely speak.
   ``I understand he has to get used to me,'' Ms.
Wetselline-Rodriguez said as she cradled the boy, dressed in red
overalls and a striped shirt, during a visit to the home where he
has been cared for.
   For months after Eric was kidnapped from his home on Dec. 9,
1986, Ms. Wetselline-Rodriguez called police and got the same
message: Nothing yet.
   She then resorted to a nationwide search using fliers and
getting in touch with child-welfare agencies.
   On Christmas Eve last year, Texas Department of Human Services
worker Mary Forrester noticed a striking similarity between a
picture of Eric on a missing-children flier and the picture of an
abandoned child who had been turned over to the agency.
   The identification process began then; the boy's mother was
officially notified Monday night that her son had been found.
   ``It was a one-in-a-million case,'' said Ms. Forrester. ``I
wasn't even supposed to get the case, but another worker was
overloaded. And when I first saw the flier, I threw it away.
Something made me go back and look at it.''
   Family Court Judge Harold Gaither Jr. on Wednesday returned the
boy to Ms. Wetselline-Rodriguez's custody after reviewing evidence
from blood tests and testimony by officials.
   A few months after his kidnapping, a Dallas woman took Eric to a
local Catholic church and told a priest that a woman she met in a
park had asked her to care for the child for a week while the woman
went to Houston to seek work.
   The church turned the child over to the state last May.
   The woman never returned, and efforts to find her have failed,
according to Dallas County Assistant District Attorney Beverly
Storey.
   Ms. Forrester said the boy would have been eligible for adoption
in November, but she postponed that process because she had a
feeling about the case.
   John and Diane Noster, who have nurtured the boy for 10 months
and have celebrated his first steps and first birthday, will keep
the boy for another week, giving him a chance to grow accustomed to
his mother.
   ``I've waited this long, what's another week?'' said Ms.
Wetselline-Rodriguez, who turned 22 on Dec. 29. ``This is the best
Christmas and birthday present I've ever had.''

<HEAD>CDC: Programs Needed To Stop West Hemisphere Epidemics Of Dengue
Fever</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. health officials warned Thursday that new
prevention and control programs are needed to prevent Western
Hemisphere epidemics of dengue fever, a tropical disease carried by
mosquitoes.
   ``The incidence of dengue in most countries of the (Americas)
region has continued to increase in recent years,'' the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control reported.
   In Brazil alone, 47,370 cases of dengue were officially reported
in 1986, and health authorities there estimate that between 300,000
and 500,000 cases may have actually occurred. In Mexico, 21,975
cases were officially reported.
   Dengue fever is caused by infection with a dengue virus and can
prompt fever, pains in the joints, and even death.
   Thirty-three cases of dengue fever were reported in the United
States in 1986.
   The CDC noted that the disease is transmitted by mosquitoes,
including the Aedes albopictus, or ``tiger mosquito,'' which is
increasingly prevalent in the United States. The species has now
spread to 17 states, mostly in the South, East and Midwest.
   ``While the ultimate significance of the presence of (the tiger
mosquito) is not known, it is likely to increase the efficiency of
virus maintenance in infested areas,'' the CDC said in its weekly
report.
   The CDC also blamed the increase in dengue infections in the
Americas on the simultaneous circulation of several different types
of dengue virus.

<TEXT>
   A 73-year-old man described as a dangerous
repeat offender was sentenced to 6 to 25 years in prison Thursday
after he pleaded guilty to stealing Limburger cheese and other food
from a grocery store.
   Hairm Richardson entered the plea to a single count of
aggravated robbery just before he was to go on trial on charges of
aggravated robbery, felonious assault and possessing criminal
tools. Warren County prosecutors agreed to drop the other charges
in exchange for the guilty plea.
   Richardson, of Miamisburg, was accused of shoplifting two pounds
of bacon, a sausage and a jar of Limburger cheese from a Franklin
grocery store last October and then pulling a knife on a store
employee who tried to stop him.
   Prosecutors said Richardson's ``criminal tool'' was a large coat
with extra pockets sewn inside, allegedly for the purpose of hiding
shoplifted food.
   James Beaton, an assistant county prosecutor, said he was
satisfied with the sentence and said Richardson will probably spend
the rest of his life behind bars.
   ``I don't think he'll see the light of day,'' Beaton said.
   In 1942, Richardson and three brothers were convicted of
first-degree murder in the slaying of a man who tried to stop a
robbery in a bar and all four were sentenced to life. Richardson
was paroled in July 1964 after then-Gov. James Rhodes commuted his
conviction to second-degree murder.
   In 1981, Richardson was convicted of misdemeanor theft in
Miamisburg and was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $250,
police said. In 1982, Franklin police charged him with drug abuse
and trafficking in marijuana; he served less than 10 months of a
1-to 5-year sentence before being paroled in May 1983, officials
said.
   ``We have to take a hard line on it. The guy's dangerous,''
Beaton said in an interview. ``This guy is not your average
73-year-old man, not by a long shot.''
   ``He's as strong as an ox and in perfect health,'' Franklin
police Detective Rick Thacker said.
   If convicted of the original charges, Richardson could have
received a 10- to 25-year term for aggravated robbery and 8 to 15
years for each of the two felonious assault charges.

<HEAD>`English Only' Condo Rule Causes Furor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An apartment cooperative that requires
new owners and renters to speak English has sparked threats of
picketing among Hispanics, who claim the rule is discriminatory.
   The language requirement was imposed at the Paradise Towers
apartment building after communications problems arose with a
Colombian couple who could not speak English. Other residents
complained they could not make the couple understand that their
grandchildren were wandering too close to a dangerous seawall, the
president of the condominium's board of directors said.
   The bylaw, which went into effect more than year ago, was
publicized recently by a story in the Miami Herald.
   Hispanics, angered at what they call a discriminatory policy,
plan to picket outside the 70-unit cooperative later this week.
   ``This is a blatant violation and we will do whatever has to be
done to get this changed,'' said Mike Morales, a South Broward
Hispanic leader. ``So long as people have the money to pay, be it
from Spain, Europe or any other part of the world, they should be
able to live where they want.''
   According to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, discrimination in
housing is prohibited on the basis of race, religion, sex, color
and national origin. Representatives of the U.S. Justice Department
say the cooperative's bylaw could violate the act.
   Under the bylaw, no apartment can be sold or leased unless at
least one member of the new household can read, understand and
speak English.
   ``It's sad that in a place like South Florida, which depends a
lot on economic relations with South America for its livelihood,
that something like this could happen,'' said attorney Osvaldo
Soto, chairman of the Spanish American League Against
Discrimination in Miami.
   But residents of the cooperative, which screens all prospective
owners and renters, say the rule is necessary to maintain safety
and the building's private club atmosphere.
   ``We screen everyone for the protection of our tenants. We don't
want undesirables living here,'' said Charles Levy, retired lawyer
and president of Paradise Towers' board of directors. ``And if we
can't communicate with people, it creates a real burden.''
   The Colombian couple moved out of the condominium in October
1986, and the bylaw was passed overwhelmingly in January 1987 by
board members and residents. If the couple had stayed, they would
have been exempt from the new bylaw, Levy said.
   No one has yet been turned away or kicked out because of the
rule, he said.
   Despite the ruckus, board members said the cooperative has no
plans of amending the bylaw unless residents demand it.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 450,000 Tyrolia ski bindings are being
recalled because of heel and toe lug breakage which could lead to
serious injury, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said
Thursday.
   The voluntary recall was announced by Tyrolia Freizeitgerate of
Austria, which said consumers should cease using the affected
bindings.
   If the lugs holding the ski bindings to the ski should fail
during use, serious injury could occur because of loss of control
by the skier, the commission said.
   Generally, should breakage occur, it happens when the boot is
being inserted into the binding. But five injuries have been
reported that may have been related to lug failure, the agency said.
   The affected bindings can be identified by the color of the toe
lug and the production code stamped on the right side of the base
of the heel plate.
   Bindings being recalled are:
   _Grey toe lugs: Models 480, 230 and 177 with production codes
starting with H; Model 190 with production codes starting with G or
H.
   _Blue toe lugs: Model 290 with production codes starting with F.
   _White toe lugs: Model 290 with production codes starting with
F; Model 280 with codes starting with G; Models 220 and 170 with
codes starting with F or G or ending with 4; Model 180 with codes
starting with G; Model 90 Junior with codes ending with 4.
   _Black toe lugs: Model 80 Junior with codes ending with 4 or 2.
   Ski bindings with red lugs are not being recalled.
   Tyrolia said consumers who bring their ski bindings to the shop
where they were purchased or to their nearest Tyrolia dealer by
April 30 will be given new replacement bindings at no charge.
   After April 30 consumers will be given a choice of reconditioned
bindings at no charge or new replacement bindings at a charge of
between $18 and $21.
   Consumers with questions can contact Tyrolia at 1-800-343-5999
in the United States or 1-800-265-7252 in Canada. The commission
can be reached at 1-800-638-2772.

   Sen. Bob Dole pocketed an endorsement from
conservative former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick on Thursday
and urged a federal death penalty for drug ``overlords and
kingpins'' as he sought to invigorate a faltering Super Tuesday
campaign.
   Dole also stepped gingerly around the issue of whether GOP
presidential campaign rival George Bush was involved in possible
CIA payments to Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega. Bush has
refused to discuss anything he did as CIA director that might
affect national security and criticized Dole for talking about CIA
matters.
   On Thursday, Dole cited news reports saying Noriega may have
gotten millions of dollars from the CIA but did not speak directly
of Bush the way he did when the Kansas senator first raised the
subject on Wednesday.
   Dole's aides hoped to use the endorsement from Kirkpatrick, a
former Democrat, to attract conservative support in several of the
Southern states holding primaries and caucuses next Tuesday. Ms.
Kirkpatrick, who declined some moves to get her to run for the GOP
presidential nomination, is popular among conservatives for her
hard-line foreign policy views.
   Michael Murphy, whose firm produces campaign commercials for
Dole, said Ms. Kirkpatrick's endorsement statement had been taped,
and advertisements would be ready by the end of the day in case
senior officials decide to use them in the Super Tuesday campaign.
   Dole's aides concede he is running behind Bush in most of the 17
states holding primaries and caucuses next Tuesday, many of them in
the South. The senator said his goal for those primaries is ``to
get our share of delegate'' at stake, and insisted it was not
possible for Bush to strike a knockout blow on that day.
   But he offered no prediction on how many of the 712 available
delegates he hopes for.
   He also conceded he is running behind Bush in South Carolina,
which holds its primary on Saturday _ and talked instead of
same-day caucuses in his home state of Kansas and in Wyoming, two
states where he said ``we look particulary good.''
   Ms. Kirkpatrick, who left the Democratic party after joining the
Reagan administration, praised Dole warmly as a candidate who is
``serious and strong and smart and honorable and can be elected.''
   ``I know George Bush and Bob Dole,'' she told a news conference.
``I've worked with both of them on foreign policy problems, and I
have more confidence that Dole can produce the flexibility and the
strength'' to deal with the country's problems and sit across from
Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Dole called Ms. Kirkpatrick the ``heart and soul of the Reagan
Revolution.''
   Earlier, in a speech to a White House conference on drug abuse,
Dole said it was wrong to give clean needles to drug addicts, as is
being done in New York. ``Giving clean needles to addicts may be
intended to prevent disease, but it also endorses addiction,'' he
said.
   He added that he favors imposition of a death penalty for ``the
drug overlords and the kingpins'' of the international drug trade.
   Dole used his speech to take a slap at Noriega, who has been
indicted on drug charges in this country, saying, ``we don't need
him around either.''
   But he seemed to back off slightly from comments he made while
campaigning in Louisiana on Wednesday.
   At the time, he said there were ``some who say he's (Noriega)
been on the (CIA) payroll since 1966.''
   Speaking of Bush, who served as CIA director from 1976 to 1977,
he said, ``He made all those decisions in the CIA. What were they?
Was Noriega on the payroll when he was CIA director? The CIA
payroll?''
   Asked to explain his comments at a news conference at which he
won Ms. Kirkpatrick's endorsement, Dole cited published reports
saying that ``for many years Noriega was on the CIA payroll, maybe
got millions of dollars from the CIA.
   ``That's all I've suggested. There are a lot of CIA directors
over the past 20 years. I'm also suggesting that it shouldn't come
as any surprise to anyone that Noriega and others in Panama have
been involved in the drug business.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virtuoso violinist and cultural ambassador Henryk
Szeryng, known for his refreshing and moving renditions of Bach and
Brahms, died Thursday of a cerebral hemorrhage. He was 69.
   Szeryng died in Kassel, West Germany, according to Herve Corre
of the musician's Paris office. He had suffered a cerebral
hemorrhage early Wednesday, then died after 24 hours in a coma.
   Renowned worldwide for a vast repertoire which he executed with
great skill and feeling during a career that spanned more than 50
years, Szeryng was to have performed Wednesday in Brussels at a
concert to benefit AIDS research.
   The Polish-born musician, who traveled on a diplomatic passport
as Mexico's official cultural ambassador, also was known for his
special preference for resurrecting neglected or lost works for the
violin.
   Last fall he delighted concert-goers in Atlanta with a
performance of a previously lost violin concerto by Reynaldo Hahn.
   Szeryng also prided himself on introducing relatively unknown
contemporary works to audiences worldwide.
   A tonalist and colorist with the technical command of a master,
he thrilled audiences with what critics called ``his obvious
delight in playing.'' Instead of wrinkling his brow with the pained
look of many of his colleagues, he appeared enraptured, smiling
happily as he played favorite passages.
   Arthur Rubinstein, the Polish-born pianist who died in 1982,
once called him ``a musician's musician ... who gave real music
lovers what they wanted: great moments of emotion.''
   Szeryng was born on Sept. 22, 1918, in Zelazowa-Wola, Poland,
which was Frederic Chopin's birthplace. His father was a wealthy
iron and lumber magnate and his mother was a professional pianist
who taught the young Henryk the piano and harmony when he was only
five. His elder brother played the violin and Szeryng, fascinated
by the instrument, took it up at seven.
   ``It was totally beyond my comprehension,'' he said in a 1983
interview. ``How could one find the right notes and the right
intervals on a fingerboard which is totally blank? Piano playing
was much simpler. You had white keys and black keys.''
   Polish violinst Bronislaw Huberman, a family friend, encouraged
Szeryng to pursue his violin studies and persuaded his parents to
send him to Berlin where he studied with Carl Flesch. Huberman's
political ideas also influenced Szeryng's lifelong commitment to
peace.
   In 1936, he studied at the Paris Conservatory, winning the
coveted first prize only nine months after entering. He studied
composition with the legendary Nadia Boulanger and Gabriel Bouillon
and became friends with Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso and Igor
Stravinsky.
   At the outbreak of World War II, Szeryng, who spoke seven
languages fluently, was made Polish Prime Minister Wladislav
Sikorski's official translator and later became a personal
goverment liaison officer. But he never abandonded his music,
giving more than 300 concerts at Allied hospitals and bases, even
during air raids in Britain.
   In 1941, he accompanied the exiled prime minister to Latin
America in search of a home for about 4,000 Polish refugees
displaced by the war. They were accepted by Mexico. Moved by this
humanitarian gesture, Szeryng took Mexican citizenship in 1946.
   In 1970, he was appointed special music adviser to Mexico's
UNESCO delegation in Paris and became the first musician to enjoy
diplomatic status.
   Although he once called Bach his ``bible'' and Chopin his
``first musical food,'' Szeryng also had a passion for contemporary
music. He said it gave him ``an extra portion of spontaneity and
freshness.''
   Funeral services are to be held in Monte Carlo, Monaco, his
European home for many years, at a date to be announced.

<HEAD>Gray Says Administration Trying To Put Wraps On Panel Till
Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commission created to recommend solutions
to the government's debt woes is apparently embroiled in a dispute
with the Reagan administration even before it begins meeting.
   House Budget Committee Chairman William Gray III complained
Thursday that the administration was trying to dictate how the
National Economic Commission would conduct its work in an effort to
keep the panel's deliberations secret during the presidential
election campaign.
   ``I don't think this commission should start off being dictated
to by the White House,'' Gray, who is a member of the commission,
told reporters. ``Someone is suggesting that we meet in a cave and
roll a stone over the opening.''
   Gray took issue with a suggestion made by Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III that the 14-member bipartisan commission, which
was created by Congress last year, should hold its deliberations in
secret and not release any reports before the November presidential
election.
   While saying that the administration wanted the commission ``to
go to work,'' Baker suggested in an apperarance before the Senate
Appropriations Committee on Tuesday that the commission's findings
would carry more weight if the panel did not become embroiled in
the presidential election campaign.
   The commission, which includes former Democratic Party leader
Robert Strauss and Chyrsler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca, is
scheduled to hold its first meeting on Friday in Washington.
   Gray said the first session would be a get-acquainted luncheon,
but he said the panel would need to quickly make decisions on
setting up a schedule of meetings and deciding how it would operate.
   However, the disagreement over such a fundamental issue as
whether to hold open hearings suggests that the panel may have
trouble operating, particularly if the members split along party
lines. Six members have been appointed by Republicans and six by
Democrats.
   Gray suggested that Republicans were trying to keep the
commission under wraps so that it would not become a forum for
airing Reagan's biggest economic failure, the string of record
federal budget deficits.
   ``I don't think it is appropriate for the White House to say
there should be nothing said or done until they get out of town,''
Gray said. ``That is like the guilty party saying don't hand down
sentence until we leave town.''
   The commission is considered by many to be the best hope the
next president will have to reach a quick consensus with Congress
on significant ways to reduce the budget deficit, which is expected
to exceed $150 billion this year.
   The commission is scheduled to issue its final report on March
1, early in the next administration and presumably when a new
president would have the most leverage to get his proposals through
Congress.
   The commission eventually will have 14 members. President Reagan
has already named as his choices former Defense Secretary Caspar W.
Weinberger and former Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis, who is
now chairman of Union Pacific Corp.
   Republican and Democratic congressional leaders have named 10
other members and the new president-elect will name the final two
members after the November election.
   Gray's comments came following a Budget Committee hearing in
which Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan repeated his
suggestion that a 15-cent-a-gallon increase in the federal gasoline
tax would be a good way to help shrink the budget deficit. The
gasoline tax is currently at nine cents a gallon.
   Greenspan had voiced the same suggestion in testimony Wednesday
before the Senate Budget Committee.
   In some unusually specific suggestions to Congress, Greenspan
said Thursday that an increase in the gasoline tax of 15 cents
would raise $15 billion annually in new revenues while leaving
retail gasoline prices still well below the levels of the early
1980s.
   Responding to questions, Greenspan said he favored a gasoline
tax over an oil import fee, which is favored by the domestic oil
industry, because an oil import fee would raise energy costs for

<HEAD>Kidnapped Marine Officer Selected For Promotion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Marine officer kidnapped in Lebanon
two weeks ago has been selected for promotion to the rank of
colonel, the corps said Thursday.
   Lt. Col. William ``Rich'' Higgins, until last summer a military
aide to former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, was selected
by a promotion board along with 78 other lieutenant colonels for
advancement.
   The promotion list was published Thursday. Higgins is No. 55 on
the list of 79 and would not actually receive the new rank for
another year at the earliest.
   The Marine promotion board was formed early this year to screen
a field of 165 men and women, long before Higgins' kidnapping on
Feb. 17.
   The 43-year-old officer was in Lebanon because he had been
assigned to temporary duty with the United Nations, heading a group
of observers in Lebanon attached to the U.N. Truce Supervision
Organization.
   A decorated Vietnam combat veteran, Higgins served as the junior
military assistant to Weinberger for two years _ from June 1985 to
June 1987.

<HEAD>Air Force Slows Space Launches, Furloughs Workers Because of
Budget Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget cuts imposed by Congress will lead to a
slowdown in the Air Force's space launch operations this year and
layoffs of as many as 500 contractor employees, the service said
Thursday.
   The roughly 28,000 civilian employees who work directly for the
Air Force Systems Command, however, should not have to endure any
unpaid furloughs, the service added.
   The Air Force said the head of the Systems Command sent a
message to his field commanders Thursday informing them of a
variety of steps aimed at coping with a $281 million cut in his
operations and maintenance fund.
   Gen. Bernard P. Randolph has ordered a slowdown in operations at
Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., and Cape Canaveral Air Force
Station, Fla., the service said. That move will force the
contractors who operate the two space launch facilities to trim
their work forces and delay some scheduled space launches, the Air
Force said.
   The command also is offering early retirement to employees;
cutting spending on travel, supplies and maintenance; and enforcing
a hiring freeze.
   ``Based on your planned and very difficult reductions in mission
support, the command can still meet its critical mission without a
furlough at this time,'' Randolph wrote.
   ``But we have almost no room for error.''
   The Air Force Systems Command, headquartered at Andrews Air
Force Base, Md., outside Washington, is the arm of the service
responsible for developing and procuring new aircraft and weapons.
It is also the parent, however, of the Air Force's Space Division.
   The Air Force uses facilities at Vandenberg and Cape Canaveral
to launch military satellites into space.
   To save money, the Air Force said the contractors at the two
facilities have been told to cut back to one shift per day, five
days a week. Currently, the contractors _ Pan American World
Services Inc. at Cape Canaveral and the Federal Electric Corp. at
Vandenberg _ employ a total of about 5,000 workers.
   Lt. Col. Doug Kennett, a spokesman, said it would be up to the
contractors to decide how many employees to lay off but ``it could
get as high as 10 percent.''
   The reduction in shifts ``will increase processing time to
prepare for launches by at least 30 days,'' the service added.
   ``Some test launches will have to be delayed and maintenance of
existing facilities will be deferred.''
   Kennett declined to say how many launches might be delayed or
which satellites would be affected.
   The move to avoid furloughs within the Systems Command follows a
congressional outcry over plans by the Air Force Logistics Command
to furlough its 84,000 civilian workers up to 10 days this year
because of budget cuts.
   The operations and maintenance account for the Systems Command
was reduced this year to $1.65 billion from $1.935 billion in
fiscal 1987. Of that fiscal 1988 total, about $231 million is
earmarked for the operation of the two space centers _ down $22
million from fiscal 1987.
   The cuts stem from a reduction in the Pentagon's budget under
the terms of a deficit reduction compromise that was negotiated by
the White House and Congress last November.

<HEAD>Missile Exchange in Fourth Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN MARRIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Missiles fell on Tehran and Baghdad for a
fourth day Thursday and Iraq said it had ``abundant'' supplies for
continuing the deadly exchange.
   Iraq's official news agency also said warplanes bombed Dezful in
western Iran and the southern city of Shiraz in the latest round of
the ``war of the cities,'' whcih has taken thousands of lives in
the 7{-year-old conflict.
   The Soviet Union denied supplying the rockets to either side.
Both are believed to use Soviet-made Scud-B surface-to-surface
missiles.
   Dispatches from the official news agencies said Iraq fired two
missiles into Tehran and one into Qom, the holy city of Iran's
Shiite Moslem hierarchy, and Iran hit Baghdad three times.
   That brought the total in four days to 27 Iraqi missiles _ 24
fired at Tehran and three at Qom _ and 11 launched at Baghdad by
Iran.
   Iran said 13 people were killed and 40 wounded Thursday in the
air raids on Dezful and Shiraz, and 20 wounded by a missile strike
on a Tehran hospital. Iraq said women and children were killed in
Baghdad, and houses and shops destroyed.
   Since the missiles began flying Monday afternoon, Iran has
listed 30 people killed and more than 130 wounded in Tehran and
said there were no casualties in Qom. Iraq has not given specific
figures.
   An editorial in Al-Thawra, organ of Iraq's ruling Baath Party,
said the nation ``has highly abundant quantities of `Al Hussein'
missiles that are ready to pound the (Iranian) charlatans.''
   Al-Qadissiya, the army daily, declared: ``The number of missiles
we have used so far is only a sample of what we have in store to
deter the enemy once and for all.''
   The missiles are named for a saint of Shiite Moslems, who make
up slightly more than half of Iraq's 16 million people and the
overwhelming majority of Iran's 50 million.
   Iran's official news agency quoted Kamal Kharrazi, a member of
the Supreme Defense Council, as saying Iran is ``quite capable of
continuing the war of the cities'' until Baghdad stops its
``inhuman attacks.''
   Although Iraq said it developed its own missiles, Western
military analysts believe they are Scud-Bs with strap-on boosters
enabling them to reach Tehran and Qom, both about 290 miles from
the Iraqi border.
   Iran also uses Scud-Bs, supplied by its Arab allies Syria and
Libya, but does not need boosters because Baghdad is only 80 miles
from the frontier.
   Earlier this week, Iran protested to the Soviet ambassador about
what it described as Soviet-made missiles used by Iraq. Iran also
said it knew what country shipped the weapons to Iraq, but did not
give the name.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said
Thursday: ``Attempts are being made to present things in such a way
as if the Soviet Union had something to do with'' the missile
battle.
   ``Claims of this kind are absolutely unfounded,'' he said. ``The
U.S.S.R. has not supplied either of the sides with weapons for
launching such strikes and in no way sanctioned them.''
   Tehran radio quoted military communiques as saying the missiles
fired Thursday were aimed at Iraq's intelligence headquarters in
Baghdad and a Baath Party center. Iraq said they hit residential
areas.
   Military experts say the Scud-B is not accurate enough at the
ranges involved to hit specific targets.

<HEAD>Spielberg, Lucas Ask Congress to Expand Artists' Rights Over Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Filmmakers Steven Spielberg and George Lucas
asked a skeptical Senate panel Thursday to give artists final
rights over their works, including the unapproved coloring of
classic motion pictures.
   ``The destruction of our film heritage is only the tip of the
iceberg,'' Lucas testified.
   ``American law does not protect our painters, sculptors,
recording artists, authors or filmmakers from having their lifework
distorted, and their reputation distorted,'' said Lucas, who
directed the hit movies ``Star Wars'' and ``American Grafitti.''
   Spielberg and Lucas, makers of eight of the 10 biggest
moneymaking movies ever, were the latest emissaries from Hollywood
asking that the United States adopt international copyright
standards that give creators _ not those who put up the money _
so-called ``moral rights'' over their work.
   ``We're here representing the 95 to 97 percent of directors who
don't have the clout we have,'' Spielberg told the Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on patents, copyrights and trademarks.
   Those testifying in opposition to the directors' request
included producer David Brown, who backed ``Jaws,'' Spielberg's
first major hit. ``Producers and production companies are part of
the creative process,'' said Brown, asking that Congress leave
arguments over rights to individual negotiations.
   The ``moral rights'' provision would prevent changes being made
in a motion picture without the consent of the screenwriter and
director once the movie has been released theatrically.
   ``I've seen my first film, `Sugarland Express,' cut down to 76
minutes to fit into a television time slot. Right now, I have no
right to protest this,'' said Spielberg.
   The issue has become more heated since media magnate Ted Turner
began buying the rights to old movies like ``Casablanca'' and
``Yankee Doodle Dandy'' and began releasing new versions with color
added by computer.
   Publishers and the creators of computer programs testified that
adherence to the Berne Convention on international copyright would
make it easier to protect American products against ``piracy''
abroad.
   Bills in the House and Senate would add the United States to the
76 nations that are now part of the Berne Convention agreement, but
none would give artists guaranteed rights to their work over the
economic rights of the financier.
   ``Outrageous acts will be committed'' if the law is not changed,
Lucas said. ``As new technologies come on, you're going to find
them fouling up what we know as copyright and art.''
   But the five senators on the subcommittee said they would
support only a limited expansion of the copyright standards.
   ``The issue of `moral rights' is one that may have to wait for
another day,'' said subcommittee chairman Sen. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.
   Spielberg said afterward, ``I don't think they sounded negative
in there. They sounded practical.''

<HEAD>Election Losses Force Tough Racial Choices on Government</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 2 grafs to clarify lead, picking up 3rd graf
``Botha must ...''</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha said
Thursday his party's election losses to the far right were
``temporary disappointments,'' but they will force tough choices
about his cautious reform of racial policy.
   Leaders of the Conservative Party were jubilant about the
decisive victory over the National Party in two parliamentary
by-elections Wednesday. They said it shows increasing numbers of
whites want apartheid strengthened and oppose even a token role for
the black majority in national politics.
   Botha must decide whether to appease those voters or move ahead
with reforms in spite of them. The far right sees his goal of
limited power-sharing as surrender. Most black leaders and white
liberals reject it as inadequate.
   One of the few black leaders showing any sympathy for Botha was
Kenneth Mopeli, chief minister of the Qwaqwa tribal homeland, who
said the election results ``spell disaster for the country.''
   ``They not only signify a triumph for the policy of partition
and fragmentation of the country, but also mean that the principle
of power-sharing espoused by the National Party has been
effectively opposed,'' he said.
   Under Botha's concept of power-sharing, South Africa's 26
million blacks would have a voice in national policy but the 5
million whites would retain control.
   He is unlikely to push for changes dramatic enough to win
support from major black leaders, but made clear Thursday he does
not want to be seen as caving in to the far right.
   Economic, social and political reform must continue, the
president said, but he cautioned in the same statement: ``Excessive
demands often lead to excessive reactions.''
   Frederik de Klerk, education minister and the National Party
leader in Transvaal province, attributed Conservative success to
the demise of a smaller far-right party and displeasure with new
wage freezes imposed on government employees.
   Both seats in Wednesday's by-elections went to Conservatives in
last May's national white elections but the winners were forced to
resign, one on a technicality and one because of bankruptcy.
   De Klerk noted that while the Conservatives increased their
winning margins compared to last year, National Party support was
stable. Combined totals in the two rural Transvaal districts wwere
15,478 votes for the Conservatives and 11,830 for the Nationalists,
compared with 12,718 and 11,575 last year.
   Andries Treurnicht, Conservative Party leader, said the results
would ``have a snowball effect'' in other elections.
   His party is favored to win a special election later this month
and appears likely to cut into National Party support in nationwide
municipal contests in October.
   Chris van der Heever, chief Conservative spokesman in Transvaal,
predicted the 6-year-old party would win control of local councils
throughout rural Transvaal and possibly in Pretoria and blue-collar
urban areas. He said the party also expects to do well in coastal
areas, where many whites protested the recent opening of beaches to
blacks.
   Van der Heever predicted the governing would put increasing
emphasis on security and law-and-order issues. He and other
Conservatives suggested the view that Botha's crackdown last week
on anti-apartheid groups, which provoked international outrage, was
an election gimmick.
   The independent Pretoria News said in an editorial Thursday:
``After being fed a diet of National Party racism for decades, it
is not surprising that the farmers ... voted for the old precepts
of that party as espoused now by Treurnicht.''
   Botha insists his reform program does not threaten white
interests, which he pledges to protect through continued
segregation of housing, schools and health services.
   It has few components so far.
   One would allow a limited number of multiracial neighborhoods,
subject to approval by residents and the government. Another,
spurned by most prominent blacks, would form a ``national council''
where Botha would negotiate a new constitution with black leaders
to bring the racial majority into national politics.
   The National Party has been in power since 1948 and has firm
control of the 178-member House of Assembly, with 133 seats to the
Conservatives' 22, but Conservatives won 26 percent of the vote
nationwide last May and expect to gain many more seats in the next
general election. The anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party has
17 seats.
   Separate Parliament chambers for people of mixed race and those
of Indian descent were established in 1984, but have little power.
   Both the National and Conservative parties rely heavily on
support from Afrikaners, descendants of the Dutch settlers who
arrived in the 17th century. Afrikaners make up about 60 percent of
the white population.

   The city of Nairobi is broke and it is
raiding other budgets and intercepting employees' health fund
contributions in order to continue providing essential services, it
was reported Thursday.
   J. Musyoka-Annan, the town clerk, told the Kenya Times that the
city is owed about $38 million in unpaid rates and other charges.
He did not say how much the city owed its creditors.
   In order to continue providing services to its 1.5 million
residents, city officials have not been paying debts, forwarding
employees' tax deductions to the government or paying their
National Health Insurance Fund contributions, Musyoka Annan said.
   He said officials are paying for other services by borrowing
money from the World Bank-financed Water Fund, which was set up to
fund water projects in the city.
   Property assessments, the city's only source of money, is not
expanding and expenses are increasing, he said.
   President Daniel arap Moi dismissed elected councillors in 1982
and appointed a commision to run the city following public outcry
over uncollected garbage, irregular hiring practices and
mismanagement at City Hall.

<HEAD>Non-Smoking Mothers Provide More Milk For Premature Babies, USDA
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who bear premature babies can provide
more milk for their infants by not smoking, an Agriculture
Department scientist reported Thursday.
   Physiologist Judy M. Hopkinson instructed mothers who delivered
babies 8 to 12 weeks early to empty both breasts at least six times
a day. She said 23 of the non-smoking mothers, or 80 percent,
maintained enough milk after the infants went home. But only 3 of
the 11 mothers who smoked, or 27 percent, continued to produce
enough milk.
   Hopkinson is located at the department's Children's Nutrition
Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Her
findings were reported here by the department's Agricultural
Research Service.
   In non-smokers, low milk production is usually due to ``mothers
not pumping their breasts enough,'' she said. ``Generally, it's not
a physiological problem.''
   But ``smokers have significantly lower milk volume than
non-smokers,'' Hopkinson said. The 11 smokers averaged 11 percent
less milk during the first two weeks after giving birth and 40
percent less by the fourth week.
   The infants have to be tube-fed because they are too immature to
suck and swallow, and ``mothers want to give them their milk,'' she
said. ``It's one of the few things they can do, and it's a very
emotional issue.''
   But many women who deliver prematurely are not getting the
appropriate information to produce enough milk, Hopkinson said.
Most of the mothers can increase milk production by pumping more
frequently. Five times a day is enough to maintain volume, she
said, and 8 to 10 times a day will increase milk volume within a
week or two.
   Hopkinson said mother's milk is preferred over formula or donor
milk beckause it is more suited to the infant and may also enhance
the infant's immunity to infections. Even so, she said, for very
low-birthweight babies, mother's milk must be fortified with extra
protein and minerals, including calcium and phosphorous.

<HEAD>Foundation Shift Suspected In Ashland Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shifting of a clay and limestone foundation is
being considered as a possible cause of the Ashland Oil Inc. oil
tank collapse that fouled two rivers and threatened drinking water
in parts of three states.
   ``We are looking at a number of things, including the quality of
materials and possible issues surrounding the tank foundation,''
said Matt Hayman, spokesman for the National Bureau of Standards.
   Two Ashland contractors disagree about whether the stone and
clay pad under the 4-million-gallon steel tank sank before the
collapse or was eroded by escaping oil.
   Workers began taking soil samples last Saturday from the
120-foot diameter foundation that supported the tank bottom and
will continue their search for clues next week, Betsy Mallison,
spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Resources,
said Wednesday.
   ``One of our researchers was there specifically to be included
in the soil examination of the base,'' said Hayman.
   The Jan. 2 collapse allowed an estimated 730,000 gallons of oil
to enter the Monongahela River, which joins the Allegheny River at
Pittsburgh to create the Ohio River. About 23,000 suburban
Pittsburgh residents lost water service for most of the week after
the collapse, and shutoffs were threatened in Pennsylvania, Ohio
and West Virginia towns that draw water from the Ohio.
   Employees of Dennis Jaskolski Contracting Co. helped dismantle
the tank after it collapsed and found that portions of the
foundation appeared to have sunk between 12 and 18 inches, said
Dennis Jaskolski.
   ``After we moved the floor pieces off, you could see that a
third of the foundation had dropped lower,'' he said.
   ``There appeared to be a defect in the stone base,'' Jaskolski
said. ``When the metal bottom was laying flat on top of it you
couldn't see it, but then we started cutting up the floor.''
   ``There is no visible settlement on the tank pad,'' said Ralph
Zimmerman, whose company, Ralph Zimmerman Excavating Inc. of nearby
Clairton, laid the foundation.
   ``When the tank collapsed it ripped the bottom too, and where it
ripped quite a bit of stone was washed out,'' he said.
   Zimmerman said state and federal investigators questioned him
about the work his company performed.
   Bid specifications required a base of compacted clay 3 to 4 feet
thick, topped by a foot of crushed limestone.
   Ashland spokeswoman Margaret Thomson said company officials
would not speculate on whether the foundation played any role in
the collapse.
   Others have speculated that the collapse might be traced to
metal fatigue in the 45-year-old steel used for the tank, freezing
temperatures the day of the accident or problems with vents in the
tank.

<TEXT>
   The owner of a nursing home has been indicted on
charges he induced 11 Irish nationals to illegally enter the United
States and work for him without permits, federal officials said
today.
   A federal indictment handed up Wednesday alleges that Peter H.
Starr persuaded the 11 nurses' aides and orderlies to quit their
jobs and move to the United States even though he was told that it
was unlikely they would be granted work permits.
   Starr, 35, of Scituate, owner of the Queene Anne Nursing Home in
Hingham, allegedly recruited the workers through advertisements in
a Dublin newspaper. After receiving 75 responses, he traveled to
Dublin to interview the applicants before offering jobs to 11 of
them, the indictment alleged.
   In May 1977, he applied for temporary permits allowing the 11 to
enter the United States and work.
   Starr was informed by the state Division of Employment Security,
which processes the applications for the federal Labor Department,
that it was unlikely the requests would be granted. But then Starr
allegedly told the workers to obtain tourist visas and falsely
state on their applications that they never had requested
permission to work in the United States.
   The Irish nationals are cooperating with investigators and
likely would be witnesses if Starr is brought to trial, U.S.
Attorney Frank McNamara Jr. said.
   Charles T. Cobb, district director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said the 11 men and women have been granted
permission to remain in the United States until August and could
request resident status. They range in age from the low 20s to 38,
said Cobb, who refused to release their names.
   Starr faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if
convicted.

<HEAD>Agency Owner Disappeared, Ship Passengers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A travel agency owner who allegedly bilked
customers out of $5 million disappeared from a cruise ship shortly
before a mutiny of its crew in Central America, passengers say.
   Fernando Inigo, the agency owner, left the cruise ship Galazy
before dawn in Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala, promising crew members he
would reboard in Costa Rica with money to pay them, passengers told
the Houston Chronicle.
   Crew members refused to continue working when they weren't paid.
   Inigo and his wife, Lorna, of San Antonio are two of five
defendants named in a lawsuit filed last week by the Texas attorney
general's office against Golden Cruisetours Inc. and two of its
affiliates.
   The three other defendants _ Fernando Mendrillo, Fermin
Gutierrez and Manuel Fernandez _ only maintain postal boxes in San
Antonio, officials said.
   A hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for Friday in San Antonio.
   Assistant Texas Attorney General Raul Noriega, who said he had
visited the Inigos' house in San Antonio, said neighbors have not
seen the couple for several weeks.
   They appeared to have taken some possessions and left, Noriega
said. Their child was removed from school, and the family's cars
remained in the driveway.
   Morris J. Kirschberg, attorney for Golden Cruisetours, declined
to comment on the case earlier this week but said through a
secretary that he has not heard from the Inigos since the lawsuit
was filed.
   After the vessel left Costa Rica and passed through the Panama
Canal, the Galaxy's captain had all passengers leave the ship in
Panama City on Feb. 21.
   The Galaxy is owned by Global Cruises of Panama, one of the
affiliates named in the suit, of which Inigo owns 5 percent,
Noriega said.
   ``He (Inigo) was very nervous,'' said Galaxy passenger Dorothy
C. Hayes. ``We were told he wasn't feeling well.''
   Ms. Hayes said Inigo talked with her and other passengers before
leaving the ship. ``He said that he had to leave in Guatemala to
meet with his bankers (in Guatemala City) and then he would catch
up with the ship in Costa Rica,'' she said. He never showed up, she
added.
   In a letter to The Associated Press, passenger Peggy Enger of
Lakewood, Colo., described conditions on the ship when passengers
first boarded Feb. 11 in Acapulco.
   ``We entered into the main lobby, it was filthy, carpet was oil
streaked, it smelled of diesel fuel,'' Mrs. Enger wrote.
   Because of failures in the air conditioning system, cruise
officials said only 50 passengers could sail, she said.
   ``I couldn't believe under those conditions that anyone would
have signed up,'' Mrs. Enger said. She and her husband decided
against sailing with the ship, which she said left port Feb. 12, a
day behind schedule.
   An attorney general's audit of Golden Cruisetours in January
determined that the company had booked a high percentage of 36
future cruises on the Galaxy, Noriega said. Each cruise carries
about 200 passengers each; the cost was $1,500 cash in advance. A
conservative estimate of receipts from would-be passengers on
future cruises was $5 million, he said.

<HEAD>Productivity Improvement Halved in 1987</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Improvements in the nation's efficiency in
churning out goods and services slowed by almost half last year
despite revised figures showing higher output in the the fourth
quarter, the government said Thursday.
   The Labor Department said productivity among non-farm businesses
responsible for three-fourths of the nation's economic activity
rose at an annual rate of 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter in
contrast to a deterioration of 0.2 percent reported in preliminary
figures last month.
   The revisions raised the productivity improvement for the entire
year from 0.8 percent to 0.9 percent, slightly more than half the
1.6 percent gain of 1986, despite the lowest hourly labor cost
increases in more than four decades.
   The efficiency improvements for the year were the smallest since
1982, when an economic recession depressed output so much that
productivity actually declined 0.6 percent from 1981.
   ``Anything less than 1 percent is a disappointing number,'' said
Roger Brinner, an economist for Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,
Mass. ``It gives you very little room to buffer pay increases and
not much leeway to improve the standard of living.''
   The revised figures showed output of goods and services by
non-farm businesses _ which account for about three-fourths of the
nation's economic production _ rising by an annual rate of 5.6
percent in the fourth quarter.
   That is the greatest increase in nearly two years and compares
with a rise of 5.1 percent in the preliminary figures before the
gross national product was revised upward last week by the Commerce
Department.
   But in achieving that higher output, businesses increased the
total hours worked by their employees by 5.3 percent.
   Brinner said that reflects an increase of 3 million in the
number of Americans with jobs last year and ``gives you an
indication that we may have an employment glut as well as an output
glut'' as seen in the high level of unsold inventories.
   Still, the higher output helped reduce the annualized increase
in labor costs associated with each unit of goods or services in
the fourth quarter from 3.7 percent in the preiminary figures to
3.1 percent in the final ones, the Labor Department said.
   Despite figures showing that hourly wages rose an average 2.8
percent for all of last year, workers still lost 0.8 percent of
their income for each hour they worked after taking inflation into
account, according to the revised statistics.
   Manufacturing workers fared even worse. Their average wage
increases of 1.3 percent dropped their purchasing power after
inflation by 2.2 percent for the year.
   Productivity in manufacturing improved 3.3 percent over the year
_ unchanged from the preliminary figures _ with output up 4.3
percent on only a 1 percent increase in the number of hours worked.
   That combination dropped the labor costs associated with each
product coming out of the nation's factories by an average 1.9
percent in 1987, the report said.
   ``Frankly, we don't foresee much improvement in productivity
this year,'' said Donald Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill
Lynch. ``Productivity improvements require rapid growth and we
haven't been experiencing much of that lately.''

   An illegal alien deported to Mexico died a
day later while trying to cross back into the United States,
officials said.
   Police said Juan Lopez Cruz, 28, was killed instantly Wednesday
when he fell off a catwalk under the Tex-Mex Railroad Bride as he
attempted to cross into the United States near downtown Laredo.
   A railroad official estimated the distance to the ground as 35
feet.
   Members of a group of aliens who were also attempting to cross
the border told police they met Cruz on the Mexican side of the Rio
Grande. He offered to show them how to get across the railroad
bridge, they said.
   The witnesses told police Cruz was walking ahead of the group
when he suddenly fell. The group of about five, which included some
children, continued on the catwalk, crossing successfully, and
notified a security officer of the accident, police said.
   The other aliens were turned over to the U.S. Border Patrol for
deportation.
   Officials said Cruz had been picked up by U.S. Immigration
officials in San Antonio and was deported Tuesday. Laredo police
said they would contact the U.S. Immigration office in San Antonio
for more information on the victim.

   Aretha Franklin, long ago canonized as the queen
of soul music, has become the all-time biggest female Grammy winner
with 14 awards.
   Before Wednesday night's telecast of the 30th Annual Grammy
Awards show from Radio City Music Hall, Franklin fell behind opera
diva Leontyne Price and jazz great Ella Fitzgerald, who held 13 and
12 trophies respectively.
   Franklin soared ahead after picking up prizes for best female
rhythm and blues vocalist for her LP, ``Aretha,'' and with George
Michael for best rhythm and blues performance by a duo for their
single, ``I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me).''
   Still, she has a long way to go to overtake Grammy's all-time
top winner, Sir Georg Solti, conductor of the Chicago Symphony,
whose recording of Beethoven's 9th Symphony won a Grammy for best
orchestral recording and raised his lifetime total to 26.
   Vladimir Horowitz, the pianist who had 20 Grammys entering the
ceremonies, won two more for best classical instrumental
performance and best classical album for ``Horowitz in Moscow.'' He
also received the President's Special Merit Award from the Academy.
   Horowitz is followed on the list by composer Henry Mancini, with
20 awards; producer-musician Quincy Jones with 19; pop-rhythm and
blues superstar Stevie Wonder with 17; composer John T. Williams
with 15; Franklin with 14; Price with 13; Fitzgerald tied in 9th
place with singer-songwriter Paul Simon with 12 Grammys each; and
conductor Pierre Boulez in 10th place with 11 trophies.

<HEAD>PTL To Make Interim Payments to IRS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PTL television ministry said Thursday
it is banking on a telethon to help it make quarterly payments to
the Internal Revenue Service ordered by a federal bankruptcy judge.
   The Fort Mill-based ministry, hit by hard times since the fall
of founders Jim and Tammy Bakker, was ordered by U.S. Bankrupcty
Judge Rufus Reynolds to make payments of $550,000 to the IRS every
three months to settle tax debts.
   Reynolds settled on the amount Wednesday after the IRS argued
for payments of $800,000 a quarter and PTL agreed to payments of
$300,000 a quarter. The first payment is due May 2.
   ``It looks like the projections indicate we'll be able to meet
the May 2nd obligation,'' said M.C. ``Red'' Benton, the ministry's
executive vice president.
   The success in meeting the payments will greatly depend on a PTL
telethon that began Monday and will run through the end of March
with the goal of raising $4.5 million above normal donations, he
said.
   The payment is meant to be an interim settlement on PTL's debt
to the IRS and could be adjusted each quarter if necessary,
Reynolds ruled.
   The IRS has said the total tax bill is between $61.8 and $82
million, while PTL has maintained the bill is closer to $5 million.
   Determination of the final bill is still before the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, which has been handling the case since PTL filed
for reorganization June 12.
   In a separate action last week, attorneys for the IRS and PTL
argued in U.S. District Court over Reynold's decision to prevent
the tax agency from revoking PTL's tax exempt status while the
ministry reorganizes. A ruling in that case is expectedsoon.
   PTL's bankruptcy trustee, David Clark, told Reynolds on
Wednesday that the ministry is ``in a period of transition away
from the celebrity preacher.''
   ``We will be seen by the audience as somewhat different,
something fresh, as a ministry that they can have confidence in,''
he said.
   Also Wednesday, Benton told the court that the ministry was
considering selling some of the 1,600 to 1,700 acres of unused land
it owns around its Heritage USA Christian retreat.
   ``We want to talk to Realtors about how we can best market'' the
land, Benton told Reynolds. ``We'll have to develop a plan for
you.''
   Reynolds, though, cautioned PTL officials against selling
developable land with a high money-making potential.
   Reynolds said Heritage USA could become self-sufficient apart
from income generated by the PTL television ministry.
   ``Are you going to abandon the Christian city?'' the judge asked.
   ``We're still interested in having a Christian city, a Christian
retreat,'' Benton said.
   But Benton said afterwards the ministry is trying to decide
whether it wants to continue in the business of building homes.
   Clark now oversees the ministry begun by the Bakkers, who
resigned last year in the middle of a sex scandal that continues to
have repercussions in the world of televangelism.

<TEXT>
   A prisoner who escaped 10 years ago from
the federal women's prison here apparently lived a crime-free life
in Arizona using an acquaintance's identification cards, federal
officials said.
   Mary Hughey Cantrell, who was 30 when she failed to return from
a 1977 Christmas furlough, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge of
escape from the Alderson Federal Correctional Institution.
   She will be held at the prison pending her April 22 sentencing,
federal officials said Thursday. The charge carries a maximum
five-year sentence and a $5,000 fine.
   Federal public defender Ira Kirkendoll said Cantrell went to
Arizona shortly after her escape and worked for several years as a
maid in private homes and resorts.
   Cantrell was arrested Jan. 5 in Phoenix, Ariz., after the
Internal Revenue Service spotted a discrepancy in income tax
returns for a Harriet Walker, Cantrell's acquaintance, who had
never worked in Arizona.
   Officials said they didn't know how Cantrell gained possession
of Walker's identification or where Walker lived.
   ``It's pretty unusual, the length of time,'' Kirkendoll said
after U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Hallanan accepted Cantrell's
plea. ``Apparently she has reformed to some degree.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kirk Brandfass said the woman's decade
of crime-free living, aside from maintaining a false identity,
should be considered at sentencing.
   ``My heavens, that ought to count for something,'' the
prosecutor said outside Hallanan's court in Beckley.
   U.S. marshals wouldn't allow an interview with Cantrell, who was
sentenced to three years after a 1975 conviction for passing
counterfeit money. Cantrell, who still has about 470 days to serve
on her original sentence, was paroled in May 1976 but was returned
to the prison in early 1977 after a parole violation.

<HEAD>Transportation Department Proposes Wide Range Of Drug Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department proposed a wide
range of drug tests Thursday for more than a half million airline
employees from pilots to mechanics, although officials acknowledged
they have no clear evidence of a drug problem in the industry.
   Announcement of the drug testing program, which would go into
effect after what may be a lengthy rulemaking process, came amid
conflicting court cases on whether such tests are legal. A federal
judge earlier this week declared random drug tests of civilian Army
employees as unconstitutional.
   But Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said drug testing _
especially random testing _ ``is absolutely critical'' in the
aviation industry to make certain travelers are not endangered by a
flight crew member, mechanic or other employee in a
safety-sensitive job being impaired by drugs.
   ``We can't wait for weeks and months while these (drug testing)
cases wind themselves through the courts,'' Burnley told a news
conference. He said he was confident the department's testing
program would eventually meet the court's approval.
   The union representing more than 40,000 airline pilots accused
Burnley of ``headline grabbing'' and questioned the need for a drug
testing program in an industry where no drug problem has been shown.
   ``There's never been a scheduled air carrier accident in the
United States that has been attributed to drugs,'' declared Roger
Hall, a vice president of the Air Line Pilots Association. He
promised to challenge any random drug testing rule in the courts
when it becomes final.
   The Association of Flight Attendants, which has 23,000 members,
also criticized the broad scope of the department's testing
proposal and said there see no justification for random testing.
   ``We're opposed to random testing. There's never been an
incident where flight attendants have performed poorly in an
evacuation because of drugs,'' said Matthew Finucane, the union's
safety director.
   While Burnley provided no specific evidence to show a problem
with drug use among commercial airline employees, he insisted
``there isn't any reason to believe that aviation has been
exempted'' from a problem that is widespread in society.
   ``I'm not going to wait until we have a mid-air collision
because a pilot is impaired or we lose a plane because a
maintenance persons (is on drugs) on the ground,'' said Burnley.
   The Transportation Department estimates that 511,000 airline
industry employees would be subject to the various drug tests
called for in the proposed regulation. The employees include more
than 50,000 pilots flying regularly scheduled commercial aircraft,
86,000 flight attendants and 297,500 aircraft mechanics.
   Other airline workers that would be subject to the tests include
cockpit crew members such as flight engineers and navigators,
aircraft dispatchers and security personnel who work at screening
checkpoints at airports.
   Under the proposal, employees would be subject to a
pre-employment test, periodic testing whenever a person is taking a
physical, post-accident testing and random testing as well as test
for reasonable cause. An employ would be subject to an initial test
on a sample of urine and a more sophisticated test if the first
test shows the presence of drugs.
   The airlines or other employers would have to submit a testing
plan to the Transportation Department within 180 days after a final
rule is issued. Burnley said he expected a final rule before the
end of the year, although he declined to be more specific.
   ``Drug testing, especially random testing, is absolutely
critical in our efforts to create a drug-free aviation system for
the American people,'' said Burnley. ``No matter how stringent our
safety regulations ... all it takes is one person on drugs in one
of these sensitive airline jobs to endanger the lives of hundreds
of innocent people.''
   The department's regulation covering airline employees has been
expected for months. Burnley's predecessor, Elizabeth Dole, called
for increased testing in all modes of transportation after drugs
were implicated in the Jan. 4, 1987 collision of a freight train
and an Amtrak passenger train. The crash near Baltimore killed 16
people and injured 170.
   Burnley said the proposed regulation covering airline employees
would be followed by similar proposals covering other
transportation employees including railroad workers and commercial
truck drivers.
   The proposal does not cover private, so-called ``general
aviation'' pilots. Burnley said the department sought to limit the
scope of the testing requirement to airline employees involved in
carrying commercial passengers.
   There have been a variety of drug-testing cases heard in the
federal courts with conflicting decisions.
   A federal appeals court, for example, has upheld random drug
testing of certain Transportation Department employees including
air traffic controllers. But another appeals court on Tuesday
knocked down similar testing of civilian Army employees. A federal
court in San Francisco, meanwhile, has declared post-accident drug
testing of railroad workers as being unconstitutional.
   Last Monday the U.S. Supreme Court, in what is expected to be a
critical case, agreed to hear an appeal involving random testing of
U.S. Customs Service employees. A lower court had ruled in favor of
the Customs Service employees, who had challenged the tests.

<TEXT>
   Four Canadian and nine Soviet
skiers set off Thursday under a hazy, primrose-colored Arctic
sunset to cross the North Pole and make a statement about East-West
cooperation.
   The 13 men face not only a 1,073-mile trek, but also must eat
and sleep in the same tent for 100 days.
   The journey got off to a late and rocky start from the snowy
fields of ice floes that link this northernmost tip of the
archipelago known as Severnaya Zemlya _ which means ``Northern
Land'' _ with the polar ice cap.
   Their faith was tested on the eve of thier departure when
expedition leader Dmitri Shparo proposed expanding the Soviet team
to nine members.
   ``It was an 11th-hour decision,'' said Canadian team leader
Richard Weber, revealing some of the uncertainty his countrymen
felt in allowing a further shifting of numbers in favor of the
Soviets. ``But when we sat down, we couldn't come up with any good
reasons why not.''
   Weber and Shparo met with Western and Soviet reporters at a
remote encampment on Sredny Island, 93 miles south of this
departure point.
   Shparo termed the Canadian concession ``magnanimous.''
   Weber said Shparo informed him Wednesday that he didn't want to
cut from the team any of the Soviets who had been in training.
   By morning, which arrives late on the Severnaya Zemlya, spirits
were high and the explorers lumbered through crowded barracks
weighing packs and redistributing gear.
   An Mi-6 helicopter shuttled the skiers and a small group of
journalists to the starting point, a windswept jumble of ice floes
frozen into a single white expanse that stretches 1,240 miles to
the Canadian Arctic.
   The Rev. Laurie Dexter of Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, an
Anglican minister, stood on a snowy ridge overlooking the solid
field that is the Arctic Ocean and called on ``the faith we have in
each other'' to take his fellow skiers safely across the pole and
into a new age of understanding.
   The men, bundled in red suits trimmed with dog fur and sponsors'
logos, sped off at 2:30 p.m. as the sun hung just over the horizon.
   The expedition will continue to Canada's Cape Columbia, with an
arrival scheduled for early June.
   The route has been covered in two parts by members of separate
teams, but this is the first attempt at a transcontinental crossing
of the pole.
   The joint expedition was planned for 1980, but the Canadians
abandoned the attempt when Soviet troops drove into Afghanistan in
December 1979.
   Shparo, 46, led the first Soviet polar ski trek in 1979, and
Weber, 28, of Old Chesea, Ontario, covered the Cape Columbia-North
Pole segment in 1986.
   ``The most interesting part for me will be the social factor of
being in a very small tent with a large number of people for a very
long time,'' Weber told reporters who visited the ski team's
headquarters in Dickson, the Soviet Arctic Circle settlement that
is the northernmost city in the world.
   Dexter said the tent measures about 14.8 feet square.
   ``There are inevitably frayed nerves and tensions, but all of us
are experienced enough and mature enough to let those things pass
and get on with the expedition,'' he said.

   Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed Thursday on a
nine-month timetable for the withdrawal of Red Army troops from
Afghanistan and said half the Soviet soldiers should be out of the
country in the first 90 days.
   The two points had long hindered progress toward a settlement
aimed at ending nine years of fighting in Afghanistan, where an
estimated 115,000 Soviet troops are backing the government against
Moslem guerrillas.
   But a U.N. report released Thursday warned that success at the
Geneva talks could leave another primary problem unresolved: the
return of more than 5 million Afghan refugees who have fled to
neighboring Pakistan and Iran.
   The report said the refugees are unlikely to return unless the
Afghan government of President Najib is replaced by one that
includes opposition and refugee representation.
   That didn't dampen the optimism of Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul
Wakil, who told reporters, ``Nothing important stands in the way of
concluding a settlement. From our side, things could be regarded as
finalized.''
   He said U.N. officials had established that ``all refugees want
to return.''
   Agreement on the withdrawal timetable had been widely expected.
   When the U.N.-mediated talks began nearly six years ago, Moscow
offered a four-year withdrawal span and gradually lowered this.
   Last month, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said the estimated
115,000 Red Army troops could be out of Afghanistan within 10
months starting in mid-May if a Geneva settlment was signed by the
middle of this month.
   Wakil said he was confident that remaining ``other issues,''
which he did not specify, also would be resolved, provided
``Pakistan could abide by the tacit and formal agreement not to
raise anything new.''
   Pakistan represents the insurgents in the talks.
   Pakistan has said that a successful settlement must be
accompanied by formation of a broad-based transitional government
to replace the Afghan government.
   Pakistan's chief delegate, acting Foreign Minister Zain Noorani,
reaffirmed that position to reporters after meeting with mediator
Diego Cordovez, who shuttled between the two sides for 2{ hours
Thursday.
   ``We are firmly convinced that a settlement without creating
circumstances of peace and stability in Afghanistan will not
persuade 5 million Afghan refugees to return,'' Noorani said. He
did not name any specific time limit as to when that government
should be in office.
   Noorani planned to return to Islamabad for a weekend of
consultations between the goverment and political leaders. He said
Pakistan would then decide whether it was prepared to sign a
settlement with the Najib government, which Pakistan does not
recognize.
   Wakil reiterated that Najib's policy of national reconciliation
envisaged a ``coalition government'' open to all political forces,
including the Pakistan-based resistance movements.
   The resistance movements, claiming to represent about 200,000
guerrillas, have rejected any power-sharing with Najib. They have
presented a plan of their own for an Islamic government.
   Wakil also took issue with the U.N. report, prepared for the
43-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission. It voiced reservations
about Kabul's plans for a ``National Front'' of the various parties
that would have a leading role in charting policies. It noted that
such umbrella bodies exist in Soviet bloc countries.
   Wakil said the National Front envisaged by Kabul could not be
compared with those existing in Czechoslovakia and East Germany.
These, he said, came into being long ago and ``under completely
different circumstances.''

   Actress Brigitte Nielsen says she has no regrets

   She adds that ``my business was terrific whether I was married

not married the actor.
   ``To stay on top, you have got to have personality and talent,''
she says. ``Then it doesn't matter who you were married to.''
   Adding that she wants to be taken seriously, Nielsen says it is
``frustrating to be seen as a bimbo.''
   Nielsen is engaged to Jets defensive lineman Mark Gastineau.

   Communities that once relied on a single
industry for jobs and looked to corporate mangers for leadership
must diversify their economies and take charge of their destinies,
urban planners said Thursday at an international symposium.
   ``Before, like it or not, companies took care of life. You may
not have liked everyting they did. But they were there. It was
secure,'' said John Clarke, a Trenton, N.J., architect who headed a
team that studied depressed mill towns in this once mighty
steelmaking region.
   ``But when that goes away, suddenly you turn around and say,
`Gee, the leadership used to be the company.' Now the leadership
has to be you,'' Clarke said at the International Remaking Cities
Conference.
   It's a painful transition experienced by older industrial
centers worldwide, the experts said.
   ``The trend is inescapable in that we're moving from an
industrial, manufacturing economy into a service economy,'' said
James Franklin, an architect and land planner with American
Institute of Architects.
   ``There are many cities that already face the same problem and
will continue to face it for a period of time,'' he said.
   The four-day conference is exploring ways to revitalize aging
industrial cities in the United States and Great Britain.
   Britain's Prince Charles, honorary chairman of the meeting, will
get a first-hand look Friday at the dispair and disrepair of the
mill towns lining the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh.
   An outspoken advocate of inner-city rehabilitation, the prince
plans to visit a new jobs center for the region's blue-collar
unemployed and a high school computer training classroom.
   On Saturday he will address the approximately 350 people
attending the conference, sponsored by the American Institute of
Architects and Royal Institute of British Architects.
   In his speech, the 39-year-old heir to the British throne is
expected to comment on the recommendations made by conference
delegates for revitalizing cities.
   ``The mayors are asking us ... do they have a right to determine
land use and a right to determine the future development of the
community. These communities have got to learn that'' their leaders
have not only the right but the obligation to influence the use of
former mill sites, Clarke said.
   ``They've been so much under the mantle of the steel industry
that their sense of the company town was so great that there was
very little sense that they could in fact control what they had to
do with an economy,'' said Charles Zucker, community planning
consultant with the American Institute of Architects in Washington,
D.C., and a member of Clarke's planning team.
   In its 120-page report, presented Monday after a four-day study
of area communities, the 17-member team recommended ``the greening
of American industry'' with parks, gardens, marinas and shops to
replace darkened hulks dominating the riverbank.
   Although drawing praise from many, the report was criticized by
those waiting and praying for the resurrection of the steel
industry.
   The general feeling is ``you're getting a garden. You're getting
flowers. You're getting no jobs,'' said Tony McGann, a community
planner from Liverpool, England, and another team member.
   ``In our area, we didn't want to see shipping die. We didn't
want to see the shipping factories die. But they all died. They
never came back,'' he said. ``So people who are waiting for steel
to come back, they live in a cuckoo land.''
   Public participation is a key to success in urban planning, the
conference participants said.
   ``We've seen what happens when nothing happens'' and when
outsiders' views are thrust upon communities, said Raymond
Rhinehart, a spokesman for the American Institute of Architects.
   No one, least of all urban planners, want regions to forget
their industrial heritage. That's why the planning team suggested
that several ironmaking furnaces near Pittsburgh become museums.
   But there's another motive.
   Displays of equipment used in the ``heroic and hard old days,''
make it clearer that ``you need to rethink you goals and move on
with your life,'' Franklin said.

   Farmers who participated in last year's feed
grain program will get about $1.45 billion in government
``deficiency'' payments this month, the Agriculture Department said
Thursday.
   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said the payments will included about $1.3
billion for corn farmers and $225 million for sorghum producers.
   The subsidies will be paid in generic certificates, which can be
redeemed for CCC-owned surplus commodities.
   Under the program, deficiency payments are required when average
market prices fall below a prescribed target price. The payments
make up the difference between the target and the market price or
support level, whichever is higher.
   In addition to the $1.45 billion due this month, corn producers
received about $2.6 billion in advance payments for 1987
participation, and sorghum producers got advances of $225 million.

   A White House conference on fighting drugs
ended Thursday with the chairwoman exhorting representatives to
return to their communities to fight the scourge of drugs.
   Lois Haight Herrington called for a ``final assault'' on drugs
in the last year of the Reagan administration.
   Those interested in eliminating drugs cannot ``give themselves
the luxury'' of relaxing after the three-day Conference for a
Drug-Free America because ``dealers, users and smugglers'' are
``waiting to see us let down, become distracted,'' Ms. Harrington
said.
   Members of the conference will present recommendations to
President Reagan, she said.
   The conference turned into a critique of the administration's
record on what is being done. Several speakers, including a member
of Reagan's Cabinet, said that not enough is being done to
eliminate drugs.
   ``We need to get away from a policy of containment,'' said Rep.
Clay Shaw, R-Fla. ``We want you to come up with a plan for victory.
Let's fight it like we fought World War II, not like Vietnam. Let's
fight to win.''

   A group of Republican senators on Thursday
demanded that Senate rules be changed to make it more difficult to
arrest absent senators, the fate of Sen. Bob Packwood last week
when he missed a quorum call.
   Their ``sense of the Senate'' resolution proposed a rule change
that would prohibit the seizure of an absent senator between 11
p.m. and 8 a.m. ``unless the pending business is of a compelling
nature.''
   The Senate sergeant-at-arms arrested Packwood, R-Ore., in his
office at about 1:30 a.m. last Wednesday when he and most other
Republicans fled the chamber to prevent the Senate from
establishing a quorum. A quorum of 51 senators was needed to keep
the Senate in session, and the Republicans were trying to end an
all-night debate on a campaign spending bill.
   Packwood literally was carried into the Senate chamber by U.S.
Capitol Police detectives accompanied by Sergeant-at-Arms Henry
Giugni. Giugni had been ordered to bring senators to the floor by a
45-3 vote of senators who were present.
   Packwood's unique arrival gave the Democrats a quorum and the
Senate remained in session all night.
   Packwood seemed to take his arrest in good humor and later
appeared at a news conference with Giugni, laughing about the
incident.
   Other Republicans were not amused. Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.,
complained Thursday that the incident meant senators might have to
remain in hiding in their offices. ``Senators should not have to
make a decision whether to leave the light on in your office at
night,'' he said.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who had made the
original motion that absent senators be arrested, said Thursday:
``We bored the American people today with almost four hours of talk
about the `tough life' of senators.'' He called the discussion ``a
tale of woe'' and suggested ``there are several million Americans
who would be glad to trade places with us.''
   Byrd criticized the resolution, citing the provision that would
limit late-night arrest warrants other than for ``compelling''
reasons. ``Who's to determine that?'' Byrd said. ``The Senate
determines that and it determined that the other evening.''
   The resolution, which was referred to the Rules Committee, also
proposed that any arrest warrant include ``a written statement
establishing the reasons for arrest.''
   Sponsors were Sens. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, John Chafee of
Rhode Island, William Armstrong of Colorado, Rudy Boschwitz of
Minnesota, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Arlen Specter and John
Heinz of Pennsylvania, Dan Quayle of Indiana, Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky, Kit Bond of Missouri, Dan Evans of Washington, Robert
Kasten of Wisconsin, Alfonse D'Amato of New York, Gordon Humphrey
of New Hampshire, Jake Garn of Utah and Wallop.

   Tamil rebels dressed as soldiers
raided a village and killed 16 people, most of them women or
children, a military official said Thursday.
   He said the Tamils attacked with automatic weapons Wednesday at
Morawewa village, 27 miles west of Trincomalee port on the island
nation's eastern coast.
   On Thursday, three rebels were reported killed in a gun battle
with police at a roadblock in the southeast. Police Chief S.
Wijesinghe of the Ampara district said there were no police
casualties.
   The officer reporting the Morawewa raid said nine children, four
women and three men were killed and three people wounded.
   All the dead were of the Sinhalese ethnic majority except for
one Tamil, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity in
accordance with police regulations. He blamed the attack on members
of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest rebel group.
   Members of the Tigers militia led a four-year ethnic war for a
separate Tamil homeland. They were blamed for the killings of more
than 200 Sinhalese in October last year soon after the Tigers
renounced a peace accord designed to end the war.
   More than 8,000 people have been killed in the ethnic conflict,
which began in 1983.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the country's 16 million people and
most are Hindus. They claim discrimination by the majority
Sinhalese, who are predominantly Buddhist and control the
government and army.

<HEAD>Political Ads Getting More Plentiful _ And Negative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political television ads grew more negative as
well as more plentiful Thursday with Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis going on the attack for the
first time less than a week before Super Tuesday.
   Gore, Dukakis and Vice President George Bush all sent out
critical ads in many of the 20 states holding primaries and
caucuses next week.
   Gore launched the first TV attack of his campaign, a pointed
60-second excerpt from the Feb. 18 Democratic debate in Dallas.
   Within those 60 seconds, Gore accuses Gephardt of voting against
minimum wage increases, against creating the Department of
Education, for tuition tax credits and for Reagonomics _ and
reversing his positions on all four issues.
   ``The next president of the United States has to be someone the
American people can believe will stay with his convictions. ...
You've got to be willing to stand your ground and be consistent,''
Gore says.
   A Gephardt spokeswoman said there would be no direct response to
the Gore ad.
   Gephardt has been running commercials criticizing both Gore and
Dukakis for several days in Super Tuesday states. Dukakis began
responding Wednesday night with an ad assaulting Gephardt's
populist message that ``it's your fight too.''
   The Dukakis ad consists of a rolling list of corporate political
action committees that have contributed to Gephardt's campaign.
``Is Dick Gephardt really fighting your fight, or theirs?'' asks
the narrator. Dukakis does not accept PAC contributions.
   Gephardt, making a stop at Baltimore-Washington International
Airport, called the Dukakis ad ``absolutely ridiculous'' and said
only 5 percent of his overall contributions are from PACs.
   He said all of his PAC contributions were fully disclosed, and
he charged that Dukakis has received millions of dollars ``from
special interests who do business with the state of Massachusetts.''
   ``It raises the specter of a serious conflict of interest,''
Gephardt said and added that his campaign would release a partial
list of those contributors Friday.
   Responding to Gephardt's response, Dukakis aide Leslie Dach
said, ``The Dukakis campaign does not take a dime of corporate PAC
money or any money from a lobbyist registered in the state of
Massachusetts.''
   Bush also joined the negative fray with an ad appearing in South
Carolina, which holds a GOP primary on Saturday. The ad denounces
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole for not being able to get Judge
Robert Bork's Supreme Court nomination confirmed by the Senate. And
it says Dole has failed to vote with the Reagan administration 30
percent of the time.
   The candidates stepping up their media campaigns in the final
stretch included Bush and Dukakis with their bulging campaign
coffers and Jesse Jackson who has borrowed money to keep his
presidential drive going.
   Dukakis put TV ads in six additional Super Tuesday states
between Wednesday and Thursday, bringing his total to nine _ North
Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Washington,
Florida, Texas and Maryland.
   Bush's ad director, Sig Rogich, said the vice president has been
running ads in Florida, Texas, South Carolina and most other Super
Tuesday states. ``You'll see more of our ads now in the last few
days before Super Tuesday,'' he said.
   Jackson planned to start $100,000 worth of TV ads Friday in
eight Southern states. The TV purchase, Jackson's largest so far,
targets Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.
   Dole's latest negative ad attacks Bush for supporting Reagan's
veto of a protectionist textile trade bill and mocks his
explanation: ``C'est la vie.''
   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., chairman of the Republican National
Committee, said the Bush-Dole match has become ``pretty rough'' but
that that is not all bad, as long as they keep their advertising
accurate.
   ``In many ways I've welcomed what's happened,'' Fahrenkopf told
reporters in Boston. ``In January I was concerned with the lack of
fire in the belly.''

<HEAD>Jury Finds Magazine Was Negligent In Publishing Killer's Ad</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soldier of Fortune magazine was negligent in
publishing a classified ad that led to the contract killing of a
Texas woman and should pay $9.4 million to the victim's family, a
federal jury said Thursday.
   Gary Wayne Black, 18, and Marjorie Eimann, 64, filed the suit
seeking $22.5 million from the self-styled ``Journal for
Professional Adventurers.''
   Sandra Black, Gary's mother and Mrs. Eimann's daughter, was shot
to death Feb. 21, 1985 at her home in Bryan.
   An attorney for the magazine said it would appeal the verdict.
   ``Considering the evidence the jury was presented, and the fact
that we weren't allowed to present all our evidence, we're
disappointed but not surprised,'' attorney Larry Thompson said.
   ``This fight goes three rounds like a lot of First Amendment
cases. We lost the first round, but put your money on us in the
next two rounds.''
   Jurors said the magazine should pay $1.5 million to Black and
$400,000 to Mrs. Eimann. The two received $7.5 million in punitive
damages. The jury heard testimony for two weeks and deliberated 12
hours.
   Mrs. Eimann shook hands and hugged the six jurors and said, ``I
just want to thank every one of you for doing what you did for
Sandra. We loved her so much.''
   Mrs. Black's husband, Robert, is on Texas' death row for paying
John Wayne Hearn $10,000 to kill her. Hearn is serving three life
terms in Florida for the Black slaying and two others in that state.
   Black contacted Hearn through a personal services classified ad
offering the services of Vietnam veterans. Hearn placed the
advertisement in Soldier of Fortune in late 1984 and it appeared in
four issues.
   The ad read, ``Ex marines. '67-69 Nam vets. Ex-DI, weapons
specialist _ jungle warfare. Pilot. ME. High-risk assignments. U.S.
or overseas.'' It also provided a telephone number.
   Attorneys for the Boulder, Colo.-based magazine and its parent
company, Omega Group Ltd., did not dispute that the ad brought
Hearn and Black together, but insisted magazine executives had no
way of knowing the ad was for illegal activity.
   Magazine attorneys insisted the responsibility for Mrs. Black's
death rested with her husband and Hearn and not the magazine.
   Soldier of Fortune witnesses defended the publication as a
legitimate military journal, saying the personal services
classified ads were run to provide employment for Vietnam veterans
who had difficulty finding work and wanted to do bodyguard work,
security duty or mercenary fighting overseas.
   Witnesses for the plaintiffs contended the ad's reference to
``high-risk assignments'' meant Hearn and others using similar
words in ads were making themselves available for criminal activity.
   A criminologist testified the personal services classified ads
section _ dropped in 1986 _ appealed to paranoids.
   Late in the trial, attorneys for the plaintiffs discovered that
James Graves, the magazine's managing editor, had signed an
affidavit in a 1982 murder-for-hire case linked to the magazine's
ads.
   His action was contrary to the insistence of magazine officials,
who contended no one at Soldier of Fortune knew of any crimes
linked to the classified ads.

   NASA administrator James C. Fletcher went to
Capitol Hill Thursday to argue for an $11.5 billion space budget
but listened instead as space committee members complained that
their recommendations were being ignored by the committee that
holds the purse strings.
   ``I'm not so certain that anything we say in these hearings is
going to make much difference,'' said Rep. Robert Walker of
Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican member of the House Science &
Technology subcommittee on space science and applications.
   ``There is an attitude in the budget committee at the present
time that NASA will get no more money this year than they got last
year,'' he said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, trying to
recover from the January 1986 Challenger shuttle accident and
gearing up for a start on a manned space station, will spend an
estimated $8.9 billion this year, far below what the agency had
requested.
   NASA had asked $767 million to begin the space station and but
received just $425 million. President Reagan's budget for 1989
would give the agency $11.5 billion, but lawmakers at Thursday's
hearing said no amount approaching that would be approved by the
House Appropriations Committee, which sends legislation for
spending to the full House.
   Fletcher told the subcommittee that the budget now being
considered could make or break the nation's space program.
   ``It is not an overstatement to say that the future of the U.S.
civil space program rides at risk in this budget,'' he said.
   No one on the committee argued with him. But Walker and others
suggested that NASA had to do a better job in selling itself to the
rest of Congress.
   ``It seems to me they (NASA) have to bring people of
credibility, like astronauts, to go in and buttonhole members of
Congress and explain the facts of life,'' he said. ``It seems to me
that NASA is going to have to begin to get awfully aggressive in
how the NASA budget is presented.''
   Walker said the American people are willing to support a
rational space program but ``there is no pressure being felt on
Capitol Hill at the present time, none whatsoever.''
   Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., a strong space program booster,
talked of ``erratic funding'' for the space program.
   ``That is not the way to develop a strong, world-class
program,'' he said. ``While these cuts have been happening, the
military program doubled or tripled.''
   Rep. Bill Nelson of Florida, the subcommittee chairman, said
``there is only one person who can really lead the nation's space
program and that is the duly elected leader of this nation. The
nation's space pgoram is going to depend on the degree of
commitment coming from President Reagan in this next year.''
   Fletcher protested that Reagan is committed to the budget, that
``it is not a half-hearted budget.''
   To that, Nelson responded: ``I'm talking about real deeds as
well as words. I'm talking about threats of vetoes that are real
threats; I'm talking about sitting down at the table and working
with the congressional leadership.''

<TEXT>
   Contra leaders agreed Thursday to meet their
Sandinista foes inside Nicaragua, but insisted on the participation
of Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who has drawn objections from
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.
   ``We are accepting a face-to-face meeting in Nicaraguan
territory,'' director Alfredo Cesar said in a communique after a
daylong meeting of the directorate.
   The Contras Thursday appointed Adolfo Calero, considered to be
one of the more hardline directors, to head their delegation.
   Ortega has proposed that the talks take place in southern
Nicaragua with his brother, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega,
heading the Sandinista delegation.
   The Contras also said that Obando y Bravo, who was dismissed by
Ortega as a mediator after two previous negotiating sessions, must
be present as a ``witness and guarantor.''
   ``Cardinal Obando y Bravo represents the only moral authority in
Nicaragua that can guarantee compliance'' with the peace agreement
reached last year by the five Central American presidents, Cesar
said.
   Ortega had suggested that the meeting be held in the town of
Sapoa near Nicaragua's Costa Rican border on March 10-12, but Cesar
said the time and place should be worked out later.
   He said guarantees of the Contra delegation's safe passage must
also established before the meeting.
   The communique signed by the five directors of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, as the Contra rebels are formally called, lambasted
Ortega for dismissing Obando y Bravo as a mediator.
   It called the action ``unilateral and dictatorial,'' and praised
the cardinal of Managua for his help in getting the peace talks
going.
   The Contras had been the first to propose talks inside
Nicaragua, which the Sandinistas inititally rejected. Now that the
Sandinistas have reversed their position, they must demonstrate
their sincerity, said Cesar.
   ``It would be very difficult for them to put this on the table
as a bluff,'' he said. ``Public opinion is going to be judging all
these actions.''
   The communique said the talks in Nicaragua should be based on
the agreement reached before the breakup of talks in Guatemala last
month.
   That includes a 30-day truce while the Contra troops enter
protected enclaves, a total amnesty, freedom of expression and a
national dialogue, said Cesar.

<HEAD>City's New Schools Chancellor Says He'll Cut Into Bureaucracy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Declaring that New York City schools are ``on
trial,'' a new chancellor was sworn in Thursday to lead the
939,000-pupil education system and vowed to cut deeply into the
central bureaucracy to gain needed reform.
   ``Business as usual must come to an end, and it must do so
today,'' said Richard R. Green, who ended a 30-year career in the
Minneapolis schools to take on the New York City post.
   Frequently departing from the text of his 20-minute inaugural
address, Green laid out a reform agenda for the next year which
included deep cuts in the central bureaucracy.
   ``By July 1, I will have a management team in place that I can
rely on. And there will be some transfers out of 110 Livingston,''
he said, referring to the downtown Brooklyn headquarters of the
city Board of Education.
   He also said he was determined to remove the time clocks that
teachers are now required to punch. And he said he would work to
find a way to make school facilities more readily available to
parents' groups.
   Green made no mention of his controversial suggestion of an
11-month school year which he made off-the-cuff Wednesday while
touring several schools.
   Among those greeting Green on the podium were Mayor Edward I.
Koch, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and Board of Education President Robert
F. Wagner Jr.
   The otherwise serious ceremony also included laughter.
   When Wagner began to administer the oath of office to Green and
said, ``I, state your name,'' Green joked: ``I, state your name.''
   Green had surprised many at an earlier press conference by
high-handedly signaling Koch to sit down. Koch turned the tables on
Green at his inaugural when, at the beginning of mayor's
introductory remarks, he pointed with mock anger at Green and said:
``Sit down, chancellor!''
   Koch continued: ``You are the head of this new army. We are
soldiers in your army. You tell us how to help you and those that
don't, you give me their names.''
   During his remarks, Green said that Koch had told him on a visit
to City Hall that ```you can have anything you want except more
money.' That is a fair point but I consider that a negotiable
issue.''
   Koch shrugged and shook his head.

<TEXT>
   Legislation approved by the Senate Banking
Committee grants banks broad new securities powers and in other
provisions offers a mixed bag for users of financial services.
   The bill, passed on an 18-2 vote late Wednesday night,
substantially repeals the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which separated
banking from the securities business in the aftermath of the 1929
financial crash.
   If eventually signed into law, it would grant banks immediate
power to underwrite mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper
and municipal revenue bonds. Banks would be able to deal in mutual
funds and corporate bonds six months after enactment.
   In a concession to the securities industry, the bill withholds
power from banks to underwrite corporate stock _ viewed by senators
as the riskiest securities area _ unless Congress authorizes that
in a separate vote by April 1991.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the committee and the
bill's sponsor, said competition from banks likely will result in
lower underwriting fees paid by businesses and state and local
governments.
   Mutual fund fees could edge down for individual investors and
more competition in the underwriting of securities backed by home
mortgages could save home buyers as much as $1,000 on a $100,000
mortgage, Proxmire said.
   Consumer groups also hailed a section of the bill sponsored by
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., that provides new safeguards on
home equity loans.
   But they said limits on bank involvement in insurance, also
sponsored by Dodd, could reduce competition in that field.
   Michelle Meier, an attorney for Consumer's Union, said Thursday
she was disappointed in the insurance limits. She and five other
consumer activists had argued in a letter to committee members that
allowing banks into insurance ``could reduce the cost of insurance
and force the insurance industry to become more efficient.''
   Dodd acknowledged Thursday that his interest in limiting bank
involvement in insurance stems from the concentration of insurance
companies in Connecticut.
   ``This is like hogs in Iowa. To me it's important,'' Dodd told
reporters. But he added that there are sound arguments for being
cautious about letting banks take on the risk of insurance
underwriting.
   And, he said, ``There's plenty of competition. I defy you to go
out to any hamlet or borough in America and not find insurance
agents competing against each other.''
   The home equity loan provision of the bill requires lenders to
disclose the interest rate on loans in a clear and uniform manner
as well as closing costs and repayment terms. It also would
prohibit lenders from unilaterally changing the terms of a home
equity line of credit after the contract is signed.
   Meier and Leslie Gainer of U.S. PIRG, a group associated with
consumer activist Ralph Nader, said in a statement that the Senate
version is an improvement over a similar home equity bill in the
House.
   Another section would make it easier for consumers to shop for a
place to put their money by requiring banks and mutual funds to
advertise in a uniform manner the interest rate paid on deposits
and money market accounts.
   Proxmire, Dodd and others predicted that the lopsided committee
vote would ease passage of the legislation through the Senate. But
similar bills in the House face more uncertain prospects, where
jurisdiction over the issue is shared by the Energy and Commerce
and the Banking committees.
   Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.,
who has expressed great skepticism about allowing banks too many
new powers, is expected to introduce a proposal in the next several
weeks. The finance subcommittee of Energy and Commerce is expected
to follow with its own version.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the finance
subcommittee, has said he favors phasing in new powers for banks _
a more cautious approach than adopted in the Senate bill _ so
federal regulatory agencies aren't swamped.
   ``It is essential that Congress link the introduction of new
powers to regulatory preparedness,'' Markey said in a statement
Thursday.

   The state Health Department will investigate
the hospital where a black teen-ager was taken after she said she
had been sexually assaulted by a group of white men, a department
spokesman said Thursday.
   The department will ask for the medical records of St. Francis
Hospital in Poughkeepsie, which treated Tawana Brawley for nearly
eight hours on Nov. 28 following the attack, spokesman Peter Slocum
said.
   Miss Brawley, 16, of Wappingers Falls, was found wrapped in a
garbage bag along a road. She was smeared with excrement and
``KKK'' and ``nigger'' were scrawled on her body. She says she was
kidnapped for four days and sexually abused by six men.
   Her family has complained about her treatment at St. Francis,
where she was taken by ambulance on the day she was found.
   ``We are obviously interested in it simply because of the media
reports,'' Slocum said.
   The health department could impose a fine if it finds care was
improper, ``but our primary concern, rather than any kind of
punishment, is to make clear the standards of care are improved,''
Slocum said.
   He was unsure how long the investigation would take.
   A source described as close to the Brawley family but not
identified told the Poughkeepsie Journal that the family was upset
because Miss Brawley was released from the hospital unable to walk
and lapsing in and out of consciousness.
   Miss Brawley went to the emergency room of the Westchester
Medical Center in Valhalla twice on Dec. 2. She was admitted after
her second visit, hospital spokeswoman Nancy McPartlin said.
   She was discharged Dec. 4, McPartlin said. She said the hospital
would provide no details about Miss Brawley's treatment.
   A spokesman for St. Francis Hospital denied the hospital did
anything wrong when treating Miss Brawley.
   Miss Brawley was treated for a cut on the scalp and examined for
possible hypothermia, spokesman Frank Hemrick said. She was tested
to determine if she was raped, and the records were sent to the FBI.
   The test found Miss Brawley was not raped, according to several
published reports. But a spokesman for the teen-ager, the Rev. Al
Sharpton, claims Miss Brawley was raped and the tests were botched.

<HEAD>Georgia Senate Approves Liquor Measure For Democratic Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill to allow a state park to serve liquor to
visiting Democrats during their national convention in July
survived some Republican jabs in the Georgia Senate Thursday.
   The Democratic-controlled Senate passed it, 40-13, and returned
it to the House for consideration of a technical amendment.
   The bill was backed by Gov. Joe Frank Harris, a Democrat and a
teetotaler who last year vetoed a bill to expand the areas of Stone
Mountain Park where liquor can be sold to the public.
   Sen. Roy Barnes, a Democrat who is Harris' Senate floor leader,
said the bill to allow the park's governing authority to sell
liquor to private gatherings would aid some large functions planned
at the park near Atlanta ``in July.''
   When Republican Sen. Tom Phillips tried to force another
Democratic speaker to name that event, Barnes drew laughter by
asking: ``Isn't it true that the Republicans chose as their meeting
site Bourbon Street in New Orleans?''
   Barnes argued the bill simply allowed the state to sell the
liquor rather than forcing conventions to bring in their own.
   But Democratic Sen. Max Brannon, an opponent of liquor sales,
said he was ``very shocked this is an administration bill'' and
added: ``I know a liquor bill when I see a liquor bill.''
   Barnes drew laughter when he said: ``If I had my perfect world
to do, there'd be a lot of things different in this world: we
wouldn't have liquor, wouldn't have sin, wouldn't have
Republicans.''

<HEAD>Robertson Comes Up Short In South Dakota</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson apparently will not seek a
recount in South Dakota's Republican presidential primary even
though he fell only a few hundred votes short of winning any
delegates, Gordon Howie, Robertson's state campaign director, said
Thursday.
   In official results, released Thursday by the state Board of
Canvassers, Robertson came up 371 votes short of receiving the 20
percent of the GOP vote he needed in order to receive any national
convention delegates from the state.
   ``I think at this point it's unlikely'' a recount will be
sought, Howie said. ``I think we're going to be satisfied having
beaten (Vice President) George Bush,'' he added.
   Officially, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas won the primary with 55.2
percent of the vote, Robertson was second with 19.6 percent, and
Bush third at 18.6 percent. Dole thus will get all 18 of South
Dakota's delegates to the GOP national convention.
   Howie said Robertson's national campaign appears unlikely to
file any complaint that could lead to a recount. ``Obviously, we'd
like to have delegates ... but indications are we're not going to
challenge the vote,'' he said.

   Pat Robertson should not hide from his
religious past while seeking the Republican presidential
nomination, the Rev. Donald J. Dunlap, Robertson's pastor, said in
an interview published Thursday.
   Robertson's ``apocalyptic theology'' concerning the biblical
prophecy of the world's end could help mold his foreign policy as
president, Dunlap told the Roanoke Times & World-News.
   Robertson has tried to avoid campaign questions about his
religious past and statements he made in writings and television
broadcasts. ``Those statements became a matter of the public
record,'' said Dunlap, pastor of Freemason Street Baptist Church in
Norfolk, of which Robertson has been a member for 28 years.
   ``They were a mixture of his religious beliefs as they impacted
upon his political beliefs,'' he added.
   He said that ``where he made public policy statements derivative
of his religious beliefs, I think the media and his opponents have
every right to question him on that as much as they have a right to
question (Vice President) George Bush on his involvement in the
Iran-Contra affair, as much as they have a right to question
(Kansas Sen.) Robert Dole about votes he cast in Congress.''

   An Arab stabbed a teen-age Jewish settler in
the back Thursday as he shopped for the Jewish Purim holiday in the
occupied West Bank city of Hebron, the army and witnesses said.
   Minutes later, angry Jewish settlers attacked photographers
taking pictures there, witnesses said.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, Israeli troops wounded four
Palestinians in violent protests.
   On the diplomatic front, U.S. Secretary of State George P.
Shultz arrived in Israel Thursday night for a last-ditch effort to
sell his peace proposal. He was met by Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres, but no statements were made.
   Legislators of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc have rejected the U.S. proposal, saying they will not agree to
an international conference or to the exchange of land for peace.
   The scuffle in Hebron, 20 miles south of Jerusalem, began
shortly after 16-year-old settler Aharon Peretz was stabbed.
   The army said later Peretz was treated for slight injuries at a
Jerusalem hospital and released.
   A photographer on assignment for Time magazine was struck with
her camera by enraged Jewish settlers. She fell to the ground
unconscious, with a one-inch gash in her forehead that required
five stitches.
   The attack reflected the growing anger of settlers and much of
the Israeli public at the news media, which they blame for
tarnishing Israel's image abroad and for inflaming unrest in the
territories by their presence.
   In the Arab village of Idna on Thursday, riot police fired on
dozens of Palestinians who stoned their jeep. An army spokesman
said three Arabs were wounded in the legs.
   Troops shot a fourth Arab youth in the neck after Palestinians
in Beita, a village eight miles east of Nablus, hurled rocks at
soldiers, according to hospital officials and the Arab-run
Palestine Press Service.
   In the Gaza Strip, troops fired 16 tear gas canisters to subdue
about 250 girls demonstrating at their school in Rafah, a
Palestinian reporter said.
   In Hebron, photographers were standing outside the home where
Peretz received first aid when a settler attacked Reuter
photographer Jim Hollander as he took pictures of a little girl.
   Hollander said the settler, without explanation, punched him in
the face, breaking his glasses and giving him a swollen lip.
   When Hollander's wife, Rina Castelnuovo, tried to break up the
scuffle, another settler grabbed her camera and hit her in the
head. She fell to the ground unconscious, blood gushing from her
forehead, Hollander said.
   She was on assignment for Time.
   ``It was like revenge on the press,'' said Israeli news
photographer Eli Herskovitz, who was at the scene. ``Those settlers
went crazy.''
   Shamir said this week he was considering further restrictions on
journalists in the occupied lands, and the Haaretz newspaper
reported Thursday all senior army officers and most soldiers
serving there support a press ban.
   Reuter bureau chief Paul Taylor said the agency filed complaints
with Hebron police and the West Bank military command. The army
said it was investigating.
   Soldiers later declared Hebron a closed military area, detained
dozens of Arab residents and rounded them up in a central square.
   As detainees looked on, dozens of settlers staged a Purim
parade, dancing in the street and singing ``The people of our
ancestors lives.'' Soldiers with clubs guarded the marchers.
   Purim is a religious holiday commemorating Esther, the Jewish
queen of Persia who saved the Jews from destruction 24 centuries
ago. Celebrants wear costumes and spray harmless foam on passers-by.
   Peretz, one of about 60 Jews who live in Hebron among 70,000
Palestinians, ``felt a sharp jab in his back, turned and saw an
Arab with a knife,'' Brooklyn, N.Y.-born settler Miriam Levinger of
Hebron said in an interview.
   She said Peretz chased his assailant several yards and threw a
can of Purim foam at him before collapsing.
   It was the third serious attack on a settler since unrest began
Dec. 8. According to U.N. figures, 76 Arabs have been killed,
including several by Jewish settlers.
   Israel took the Gaza Strip and the West Bank from Egypt and
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Both Peretz and his father, Meir Peretz, complained that
reporters got in the way of soldiers trying to pursue the assailant.
   The head of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Shilo Gal,
condemned the attack on the journalists.

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
accused rival Richard Gephardt on Thursday of trying to impose ``a
$50 billion burden on this nation's economy'' with an oil import
fee.
   Dukakis, barnstorming across Texas in quest of the 183
Democratic delegates at stake in the biggest Super Tuesday primary,
also said the Missouri congressman's trade legislation would ignite
a global trade war like the one that ushered in the Great
Depression.
   Meanwhile, the Dukakis campaign rolled out an anti-Gephardt
television ad. As the screen is filled with the names of banks,
defense contractors, utilities and other big businesses whose
political action committees have contributed to Gephardt, a
narrator asks, ``Is Dick Gephardt really fighting your fight ... or
theirs?''
   To revive the ailing U.S. oil industry _ a major issue in Texas
_ Dukakis said he favors targeted incentives to encourage small,
independent producers to ``do their drilling and get that rig count
up.'' In addition, he called for repealing the oil windfall profits
tax, filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and boosting natural
gas production.
   Gephardt supports a fee on oil imports. However, Dukakis said,
``An oil import fee will put a $50 billion burden on this nation's
economy. We don't need that.''
   Dukakis took another dig at Gephardt in a speech at the
Harlingen airport. Recalling an exchange Monday in a Williamsburg,
Va., debate when Gephardt asked if Dukakis is running ``for
president of Mexico or president of the United States,'' the
governor said to cheers, ``I said, Dick, if I'm president of the
United States, I'm going to pay attention to our relationship with
Mexico, and I'm going to make sure that my proposals do not wreck
the economy of Mexico.''
   A mariachi band greeted Dukakis in Harlingen and he repeated
more than five minutes of his speech in Spanish for the largely
Hispanic crowd. He promised that in January 1989, ``we're going to
stop the shooting war in Nicaragua and begin to go to work with our
neighbors in Mexico ... as partners to create opportunity on both
sides of the border.''
   Dukakis, on a visit to a successful small manufacturer of rubber
parts for oil drills in the East Texas town of Tyler, also took a
shot at Gephardt's trade policies, which call for retaliation in
response to foreign nations' trade practices that are judged unfair.
   ``We can never agree to go back to policies that almost
destroyed us 50 years ago. There's always somebody who suggests
that: throw up the walls, hunker down,'' Dukakis said.
   Invoking a baseball metaphor, he recalled the towering
left-field wall at Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, and
said, ``You can build that wall as high as you possibly can, and
Jim Rice can still hit it out.''
   Later, in Corpus Christi, he said, ``Trade wars are like nuclear
wars. They have no victors, only victims.''
   Glenn Hilbun, 31, a supervisor at the rubber parts plant, said,
``Down here, a lot of people are not really familiar with what
Dukakis stands for. Face it, Texas is a Bush state'' _ a reference
to the Republican vice president.
   Polls in Texas show a tight Democratic field and many undecided
voters.
   Dukakis, considered strong in Hispanic South Texas, was trying
to rally that support with stops here and at Harlingen and Laredo
on the border before heading on to Houston and Lubbock. He heads
west Friday to Denver, Cheyenne and Seattle, but was due back in
San Antonio Saturday night.
   Speaking to 350 supporters on a stage set under palm trees
before Corpus Christi bay, he said the 1981 Reagan tax cuts,
supported by Gephardt, are ``the primary cause of a trade deficit
that has cost 2 million American jobs. We can't lead the world if
we're in debt to it.''
   Dukakis said 1.25 million Southern workers ``depend on exports
for their jobs. These workers need a president who will use his
authority to insist on fair treatment for American goods and
services overseas. As president I will use that authority.''
   Even at MP Industries, the thriving Tyler business that got off
the ground 11 years ago with help from a Small Business
Administration loan, Dukakis found firsthand evidence of U.S. trade
problems.
   A gleaming, green computerized $100,000 lathe bore the
manfacturer's name on its side in bold letters: Hitachi-Seiki.
Another key piece of equipment came from Italy.
   ``This is the story everywhere,'' said Dukakis. ``We're buying
streetcars in Japan.''

<TEXT>
   The PTA on Thursday urged presidential
candidates to ``pay more than lip service'' to the educational,
after-school and health needs of the nation's children.
   A PTA memo to all 10 candidates, released in time to catch their
attention before the Super Tuesday primaries in 16 states, reflects
a more activist stance on children's issues by the 6.1
million-member association, said Arnold Fege, the PTA's director of
governmental relations.
   Until now, Fege said, the group has focused on individual issues
and never developed a complete agenda.
   ``We see a lot of the candidates kissing kids at rallies, but we
don't hear much on what the candidates intend to do about
children's issues,'' Fege said. ``We want to force the candidates
to take a position on these issues.''
   The PTA's message to the candidates, formally called ``A
Memorandum to the 41st President of the United States: A National
Children's Agenda `Because Children Are the Future,''' asks the
next president to convene a ``children's summit'' of parents,
teachers, government officials and social service workers
immediately after Inauguration Day. The group's task would be to
``recommend a coordinated, comprehensive and workable national
youth and family policy.''
   The four-page memo also recommends:
   _Increased spending on the Chapter 1 and Head Start programs for
disadvantaged children.
   _That the federal government work with the states to develop a
plan to equalize spending on education among the states.
   _That public schools be encouraged to play a bigger role in
providing early childhood, preschool and before- and after-school
care.
   _That the federal government provide sufficient money for
ensuring that all children be immunized against polio, diphtheria,
measles, tetanus, whooping cough and mumps.
   _That the federal government assist states and local education
agencies in providing preventive education programs on drug abuse,
teen suicide, teen pregnancy and AIDS.
   _That the federal government commit whatever resources are
necessary for adequate shelters, health services and education for
homeless families and youths.
   Fege acknowledged that the PTA's recommendations are costly and
he suggested that the money come from additional taxes, rearranging
federal spending priorities or continuing the budget deficit.
   ``Our organization has become indignant that the presidential
candidates are not putting meaty children's issues on the agenda,''
Fege said. ``We want them to pay more than lip service.''

<TEXT>
   Negotiations aimed at reaching a new long-term
grain agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union are
scheduled to start next week in Vienna, the Reagan administration
announced Thursday.
   ``We look forward to our discussions with the Soviets on a new
U.S.-Soviet long-term grain agreement,'' said a joint statement
from Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng and U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton K. Yeutter.
   Such an agreement would represent the third such arrangement
between the two nations since 1975. The second was signed in 1983.
   ``We expect the Vienna meeting to be the first step in the
negotiating process,'' the statement said. It said the earlier
accord ``have been important in stabilizing grain trade between our
two countries and we are optimistic we will be able to achieve
another mutually beneficial agreement.''
   Under the current agreement, which expires Sept. 30, the Soviets
agreed to purchase 9 million metric tons of U.S. wheat and corn
products annually for five years. Four million tons of that amount
must be wheat and 4 million tons must be corn.
   The Soviets may satisfy their commitment to purchase an
additional 1 million tons by buying wheat, corn, soybeans or
soybean meal, or any combination of those commodities, with every
ton of soybeans or soybean meal counting as two tons of grain.
   The announcement follows a sale by private exporters of 500,000
metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union announced
earlier this week. At recent prices it would have a value of $50
million.
   The sale was subsidized under the Export Enhancement Program, in
which private exporters receive surplus government commodities in
exchange for shipping American grain overseas.
   More than 6.8 million tons of subsidized wheat has been sold to
the Soviet Union under the program for delivery in the year that
began last Oct. 1.
   It represents a turnaround from 1986, when the Soviets fell 3.8
million tons short of the minimum under the five-year agreement.
   The United States then made offers to the Soviets under the
Export Enhancement Program and they resumed buying in May 1987.

<TEXT>
   More than 81,000 AIDS cases were reported to the
World Health Organization by the end of February, nearly double the
number registered a year before, the agency said Thursday.
   However, nearly one-third of the countries reporting had not
updated their national figures for at least six months, the
organization said.
   WHO said it was notified of 81,433 cases of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome in 133 countries, with 4,167 new cases in
February alone. By the same point last year, 91 countries had
reported 42,404 people suffering from the deadly disease.
   The actual number of AIDS cases is believed to be twice the
reported total, said Dr. Jonathan Mann, head of WHO's AIDS program.
He has predicted at least 1 million cases by 1990.
   The report said 42 countries had not updated their numbers for
at least six months, including Rwanda and the Central African
Republic which last reported a combined figure of 959 cases in late
1986.
   The United States last month listed a total of 53,069 cases, up
from 31,036 a year earlier. France reported 3,073 cases by Dec. 31,
more than 2{ times the 1,221 cases reported at the end of 1986.
   The numbers reported by Canada increased less markedly. The
figure stood at 1,488 in January, against 1,000 in April 1987.
   Uganda reported 2,369 cases by the end of October, four times
the number registered 12 months earlier. The number of people
suffering from the disease in Brazil more than doubled in 10
months, reaching 2,325 cases by Dec. 7.
   Of 28 European countries reporting to WHO, Albania was the only
one to list no cases. In the other 27 countries, the reported total
of 10,177 cases represented a 128-percent increase within a year,
WHO said.
   The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is most
often transmitted through sexual contact.
   Other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted
blood or blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic
needles or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from
mother to child at or before birth.

<HEAD>Four Libyan Pilots Fly Home from Egypt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Libyan pilots who landed in Egypt two
days earlier flew their Soviet-built warplanes home Thursday in a
rare example of cooperation between the combative neighbors,
sources in both countries said.
   An Egyptian government source said permission for the MiG-23s to
leave indicated Cairo accepted a Libyan explanation that bad
weather and shortage of fuel forced the planes down. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Cairo newspapers had presented the landings as a defection.
   Egypt's official Middle East News Agency quoted a Libyan air
force spokesman as saying the planes ``returned to Libya today
(Thursday).'' It said the confirmation was distributed by JANA, the
official Libyan agency.
   ``It is a gesture of Egyptian good will,'' the government source
said of the decision to allow the planes to return home. He
referred indirectly to a political rift that has allowed few such
gestures in 15 years.
   He said the pilots and MiG-23s left for Libya from the
Mediterranean town of Mersa Matrouh, where they were taken after
landing at a desert oasis near the border.
   On Tuesday, MENA quoted an official source as saying four Libyan
MiG-23s had landed at an Egyptian airfield. A source at the Cairo
airport said they put down at Siwa Oasis, 30 miles east of the
border and 385 miles west of Cairo.
   Libya remained silent until Thursday morning, when an air force
spokesman who was not identified said the planes asked permission
to land in Egypt after running low on fuel.
   His statement, distributed by the official agency JANA, said bad
weather had thwarted repeated attempts to land in Libya.
   President Hosni Mubarak confirmed the landing to reporters
Tuesday night and said of a reported asylum request by the pilots:
``Egypt is their country. The matter is under study.''
   In three cases last year, Libyan fliers defected to Egypt in a
transport plane and two helicopters.
   The statement by the Libyan air force spokesman Thursday was a
departure from usual practice in that it was couched in friendly
terms.
   He said was quoted as saying: ``The pilots were treated in a
fraternal way at the Egyptian base. The aircraft, with their
pilots, are on their way to return to their land of the Great
Jamahiriyah (Libya).''
   Egypt and Libya have been at odds since Egypt refused a merger
proposal from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in the early 1970s.
They fought a five-day border war in July 1977 after several
bombings in Cairo and other Egyptian cities that Egypt blamed on
the Libyans.

   Fallen TV evangelists Jimmy Swaggart and
Tammy Bakker have been invited to be hosts of the annual Loyal
Order of Hibernians parade, but organizers say they won't be
surprised if the answer is no.
   Last year organizers invited Lt. Col. Oliver North to be grand
marshal of the half-block long St. Patrick's Day parade. The year
before it was deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos.
Neither accepted.
   This year they want Swaggart, who stepped down from his pulpit
after tearfully admitting that he had sinned, to be grand marshal,
said Mayor Jim Lynch.
   They want Mrs. Bakker, wife of former PTL evangelist Jim Bakker,
to be parade queen. Bakker stepped down last year after revelations
of sex and hush money.
   ``We had a little dissension on that, but one of the guys said
if she wore green eye shade it would be OK,'' Lynch said.
   They also want Republican presidental candidate Pat Robertson, a
former TV minister, in charge of publicity.
   ``He has a good Irish bent for saying the first thing that comes
to his mind,'' Lynch said. ``We like him because he's not too
bothered with facts.''

<HEAD>Gingrich Seeking Support For Ethics Complaint Against House
Speaker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Newt Gingrich said Thursday he has
decided to delay seeking an ethics investigation of House Speaker
Jim Wright to give other activist Republicans time to consider
whether to join him in the action.
   Gingrich, R-Ga., said his announcement last month that he
planned to ask the House ethics committee to initiate an
investigation of Wright prompted several other House Republicans to
inquire about joining his complaint.
   ``We've been meeting with people, answering their concerns and
trying to give them an opportunity to decide whether they want to
co-file with us,'' Gingrich said.
   Under House rules, any member can ask the ethics panel to
investigate another member. The panel, composed of six Democrats
and six Republicans, can reject such a request only by a majority
vote.
   Gingrich declined to identify the other Republicans who had
expressed an interest in joining the complaint against Wright. He
said he has briefed House Republican Leader Robert Michel of
Illinois, but does not expect Michel to participate.
   ``There is a question of whether it would be appropriate for a
leader who has to work with the speaker on a daily basis to be
involved in this type of issue,'' Gingrich said.
   He has called for an investigation of allegations of unethical
conduct by Wright, D-Texas, that have been raised in news reports
over the past 10 years.
   The reports include allegations that Wright has failed since
1980 to file required financial disclosures reports from a company
in which he is a partner and that he received 55 percent royalties
on a book published by a friend whose printing company worked for
Wright's campaign committees.
   Gingrich said Thursday he still intends to seek an investigation
of Wright before the end of the month, even if no other congressmen
join with him.

   Louis G. Seaton, former chief labor negotiator at
General Motors Corp., died Thursday after a brief illness. He was
81.
   Seaton, who had homes in Sarasota, Fla., and Orchard Lake,
retired in 1970 after more than 42 years with the world's largest
automaker. He died in Sarasota.
   He joined GM as a graphic artist in 1928, transferring to the
industrial relationship department four years later.
   In 1946, he was named director of labor relations, with
responsibility for day-to-day relations with the United Auto
Workers and national contract negotiations until his retirement. He
became a vice president in 1957.
   ``Lou Seaton was a pioneer in the fields of labor relations and
personnel policy in General Motors and the domestic automobile
industry,'' said GM Chairman Roger Smith.
   Survivors include his wife, Kathleen; a daughter; son; three
brothers; 10 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. A funeral
was scheduled for Monday in Orchard Lake.

<HEAD>Presidents Have More Privacy With Less Security, Former Agent Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Secret Service agent said Thursday
that former Presidents Ford and Carter will find far more privacy
when no they no longer have federal agents protecting them.
   Michael Endicott, a Secret Service agent for 20 years who now
provides private security for former President Nixon, told the
Senate Government Operations federal spending subcommittee there
should be a time limit on Secret Service protection of former
presidents and their families.
   ``I believe the government should provide funding to the former
president so that they can manage their own day-to-day security
needs,'' Endicott said. ``There is a need for a security or law
enforcement presence around a former president that naturally flows
from occupying the most important office in the country.''
   But Endicott, testifying on a bill that would reduce federal
protection for former first families, said Secret Service
protection often limits the recipient's freedom of movement. He
said he has never felt Nixon's safety has been threatened since he
began to handle his security, traveling to cities around the world
and attending sporting and other public events.
   ``At most of these events, we usually sit in the general public
seats, even though VIP boxes are usually available,'' he said.
``There is more privacy with fewer people. We are able to go to
more ballgames now than when he had Secret Service protection.''
   The big difference, he said, is that the Secret Service must
``protect against the potential threat, while I can protect from
the actual threat.'' Endicott said he, alone, travels with Nixon,
whereas the Secret Service must assign up to 24 agents to protect
former presidents.
   Endicott said most of the threats Nixon has received have come
from people unable to carry them out, such as inmates in mental
institutions.
   ``Former presidents Ford and Carter will find out what President
Nixon did,'' he said. ``There is a hell of a lot more privacy in
smaller numbers.''
   The legislation introduced by Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., would
eliminate Secret Service protection for former presidents and their
families after they have been out of the White House for five
years. It provides for emergency and extended protection after that
if it is deemed necessary by the Treasury Department.
   Chiles said Secret Service protection for Ford and Carter and
their families cost $8 million in 1986. Nixon gave up his federal
government protection, which then cost about $3 million a year, in
1985.
   The Chiles bill also calls for a $300,000 annual limit on staff
and office allowances, to be reduced over a nine-year period to
$200,000. Chiles told the hearing that programs for ex-presidents,
including an annual $99,500 annuity, Secret Service protection,
office allowance and staff, has gone from $380,140 in 1960 to about
$26 million in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30.
   ``The American people want former presidents to live a dignified
retired life as an elder statesman, free from any real danger and
free from any need to commercialize _ to huckster _ the office of
the preisdency,'' he said. ``But the programs were left open-ended.
Things have gotten out of hand.''
   Each of the former presidents wrote letters to Chiles on his
legislation. Ford and Nixon agreed with its purpose on security
protection.
   Carter said the elimination of security ``would make it almost
impossible for us to live a normal private life at home free of
uninvited vistors, to attend major events if our attendance is
publicized, or to travel to many places in our country or abroad.''
   He said he can not afford private security. However, he said if
Secret Service experts can reduce the level and cost of his
protection, he would not object.

   Pro-Iranian kidnappers freed West German
hostage Ralph Schray in west Beirut on Thursday after holding him
for five weeks, and he was turned over to the West German Embassy
in Damascus.
   The West German charge d'affaires, Klaus Auchenbach, refused to
make any comments to reporters as he shuttled between the embassy
and the Foreign Ministry, about a mile apart in the Syrian capital.
   He said it was ``not worthwhile'' for them to wait around,
indicating that Schray would not appear in public.
   This raised speculation the former captive may not be as well as
Bonn portrayed him to be after his ordeal. The Bonn Foreign
Ministry had said earlier that Schray, 30, was in ``good physical
condition.''
   Friedhelm Ost, the West German government's chief spokesman in
Bonn, said only that the Syrian government had handed Schray over
to embassy officials.
   Schray, a Lebanese-born industrial engineer, was freed before
dawn. A Syrian military source in the Lebanese capital said he was
driven the 55 miles to Damascus under heavy Syrian escort.
   On Wednesday, the Holy Warriors for Freedom claimed
responsibility for Schray's abduction and said he would be freed
within hours as a result of Syrian mediation.
   The official Syrian Arab News Agency said Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa contacted his German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, by telephone to report that Schray has been released and
was safe in the hands of Syrian troops in Lebanon.
   The agency said Genscher ``expressed his deep gratitude to
Syrian President Hafez Assad for all the efforts Syria has exerted
and reiterated Bonn's determination to consolidate the traditional
ties between the two nations.''
   A few hours after his arrival in Damascus, an embassy employee
said Schray was still inside the embassy. He spoke on condition of
anonymity and would not comment on Schray's physical condition.
   Schray's Lebanese wife, Rana Mounla, and his uncle George Abu
Nassar, were seen leaving Beirut in the early afternoon.
   Mrs. Schray, who is pregnant, said: ``I'm going to see him.''
   She said: ``I'm taking clothes for him.''
   She indicated the couple would return to Beirut, saying: ``When
we're back together in Beirut tomorrow we'll both talk to you.''
   Schray's kidnappers also claimed responsibility for kidnapping
two West Germans in January 1987 _ Rudolph Cordes and Alfred
Schmidt. Schmidt was released in September, but Cordes remains in
captivity.
   Schray's mother, Fahima Schray, said from Fort Myers, Fla., that
her son's captivity was ``the most terrible days of my life. It was
so difficult.''
   ``I couldn't sleep last night one minute. This morning,
everything has changed completely, as if I'm a new woman,'' she
said.
   There are 22 foreigners missing after being kidnapped in
Lebanon. They include nine Americans, four Frenchmen, three
Britons, a West German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two
unidentified men.
   The hostage held longest is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was seized
March 16, 1985.
   Schray's release brought to seven the number of foreign hostages
that have been released by kidnappers since September: two
Frenchmen, two West Germans, a South Korean, a Norwegian and a
Swede.
   In their statement Wednesday, the Holy Warriors for Freedom said
Schray would be freed as ``goodwill gesture number two.'' They had
also called Schmidt's release a goodwill gesture.
   But they warned: ``We have an assortment of German targets on
our hit list and also have a hand stretched out for dialogue.''
   West German officials say the Germans have been kidnapped in an
effort to pressure Bonn to release two Lebanese Shiite brothers.
   One of the brothers, Abbas Hamadi, has since been put on trial
in Duesseldorf on charges of kidnapping Schmidt and Cordes to press
for the release of his brother, Mohammed Ali.
   Mohammed Ali is being held in Frankfurt on charges of
involvement in the 1985 hijacking of an American TWA jetliner to
Beirut and the murder of a U.S. Navy diver on board.
   The kidnappers warned that any pressure on them ``will only lead
to ... the liquidation of the Cordes case.''
   The group is believed to be led by Abdel-Hadi Hamadi, a third
Hamadi brother, who also is head of the security apparatus of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, a fundamentalist Iranian-backed faction
linked to the kidnapping of the 22 foreigners still missing in
Lebanon.

<HEAD>Rep. Vento Challenges Interior Secretary on Park Service Spending</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee chairman accused
Secretary of Interior Donald P. Hodel of breaking faith in his
budget proposal to increase operational funds for the national
parks by only $3 million next year.
   Congress intended that some $52 million in park fees being
collected this year be added to the operations and maintenance
account in the National Park Service budget for next year, said
Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn.
   Vento, who is chairman of the parks subcommittee of the House
Interior Committee, told Hodel ``You're breaching faith'' at a
hearing of the full committee on the budget requests of the
Interior Department.
   Park operations and maintenance got $731 million for the current
fiscal year. For the year beginning Oct. 1, Hodel is seeking $734
million.
   Hodel referred Vento to a passage in the committee's report to
the House Budget Committee early last year recommending a ``stable
funding base'' of $675 million.
   But in the catch-all spending bill enacted in December for the
government as a whole, Congress increased the park operations and
maintenance account by about $15 million and then added $40 million
in fee revenue for specified projects.
   ``That $40 million (is added) to the baseline,'' making it $715
million, argued Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho.
   ``Our commitment was that we would not offset park fees against
the base operating level,'' Hodel told Craig. ``I think we've kept
faith. We're not being treated fairly.''
   When his turn came, Vento said, ``Are you going to sit there and
tell me there haven't been reductions in other park operations ...
to offset the fees?''
   Hodel replied, ``I am,'' and Vento rattled off a series of
reductions of $2.7 million, $3.2 million and $3.9 million. ``What
are they?'' he asked. He got no direct answer.
   The operations and maintenance request ``doesn't even provide
the 2 percent (pay) increase for employees. You're going backward,
not forward,'' Vento said.

   Israelis donned funny hats and costumes
Thursday to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim, but the
festivities were overshadowed by three months of Arab protests in
the occupied territories.
   ``We have some very serious news, but first we want to wish you
a happy Purim,'' an Israel army radio announcer said in a phrase
that symbolized the joy and tension of the day.
   The radio then reported that Israeli troops shot and injured at
least three Palestinian protesters and that a 16-year-old Jewish
youth was wounded when an Arab assailant stabbed him in the the
West Bank town of Hebron.
   The youth said he threw a canister of Purim foam at the
attacker, the national Itim news agency said. Pranksters spray the
harmless foam at passers-by on the holiday.
   The radio marked Purim with a prank, saying the Transport
Ministry decided to replace all male taxi drivers with women
because men are ``too arrogant, aggressive and ruin tourism.''
   Purim is a religious holiday honoring Esther, the Jewish queen
of Persia who saved the Jews from destruction at the hands of the
leader Haman 24 centuries ago.
   Jews celebrate the deliverance by reading the biblical Book of
Esther in synagogues. Whenever the reader mentions the name of the
hated Haman, the congregation shouts and shakes noisemakers.
   Jews also mark the holiday by drinking wine, sending gifts and
holding carnival parades. About 500,000 people gathered in Tel Aviv
Thursday to watch 1,500 people march in a Purim parade.
   Media pranks are considered an essential part of Purim, but the
jokes were overshadowed by the unrest in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, where 76 Palestinians have died at the hands of
Israelis since Dec. 8.
   On Israel army radio, actor Tuvia Tzafir impersonated Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir switching
their views on peace with the Arabs.
   A cartoon in the daily Maariv newspaper showed the government
dressed for Purim as a clown rocking on unsteady feet. The drawing
showed a Palestinian wearing the head of a peace dove but holding a
knife and firebomb, and the army in the mask of a barking monster.
   The costumes chosen by children also reflected the political
tension.
   In addition to young Esthers, brides and Ninja warriors, some
boys in Jewish West Bank settlements dressed up as soldiers,
complete with riot helmets, plastic shields and clubs. But one
customary children's costume was missing this year _ that of the
Arab.
   In Jerusalem, 27 students of the Bezalel Arts Academy, which
usually throws one of the best Purim parties in town, were detained
and others dispersed by police during a march Wednesday.
   Police said the students violated conditions of a permit for a
Purim procession when they unrolled signs saying, ``Let's not lose
our humanity.''

   A Swedish relief worker held captive in
Lebanon for 25 days said Thursday the worst moment for him and a
Norwegian colleague was when they were given injections they feared
would be fatal.
   The Swede, 44-year-old Jan Stening, and William Jorgensen, 58,
of Norway, were working for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency when
they were kidnapped Feb. 5. The agency cares for Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon.
   Stening and Jorgensen were freed Tuesday and reunited with their
families at a Vienna hotel the next day, after arriving from Beirut.
   At a news conference Thursday, Stening said: ``When we got those
shots was a very tense situation.''
   He said it happened a few hours before their release, and ``We
both said goodbye ... because we said that was our very last
moment.''
   The purpose of the injections was to make them unconscious so
they could be moved to another location, he said, but the captives
thought the shots were meant to kill them.
   Asked whether they were forced to take the injections, he said:
``We never discussed what we were forced to do. We just accepted
everything.''
   With Stening was his wife Lis, a Stockholm lawyer, and his
12-year-old son Daniel. He did not attend a news conference with
Jorgensen on Wednesday night, explaining that he wanted more time
with his family.
   Jorgensen told reporters one of the kidnappers told them, ``We
thought you came from a secret service'' but an investigation
showed that to be a mistake.
   Stening said four gunmen kidnapped them near Sidon, south
Lebanon's provincial capital, as they were driving in a marked U.N.
car from their base in Tyre to Beirut.
   Both said they had no idea who abducted them. Stening said the
captors spoke Arabic except for the last few days in an apartment
that appeared to be in Beirut, when one spoke English.

   USAir has agreed to buy 50 Boeing 737
jetliners with options for 30 additional aircraft, a deal worth
$2.4 billion if all the options are exercised, the airline said
Thursday.
   Delivery of the new jets will begin in April 1989 and continue
through December 1991.
   The twin-engine, short-to-medium range aircraft is the most
popular jet ever sold by the Seattle-based Boeing Co. The deal with
USAir brings to 2,001 Boeing 737s on order.
   Edwin Colodny, USAir chairman and president, said the order ``is
indicative of the health and vitality'' of the airline, which has
its headquarters at Washington National Airport.
   ``Our track record makes it possible to order these new aircraft
which will benefit our passengers and the communities we serve,''
Colodny said in a statement.
   USAir Group, the holding company for USAir as well as Piedmont
Aviation and Pacific Southwest Airlines, recently reported a 1987
net income of $194.6 million on revenue of $3 billion.
   The three airlines together fly 166 Boeing 737 aircraft, more
than any other carrier. Piedmont was the initial customer of the
Boeing 737 series 400 jetliner which is the newest version of the
plane.
   The 50 aircraft on order will include of the smaller series 500
models that will be introduced by Boeing in early 1989. The Boeing
737s have a seating capacity ranging from 108 seats for the series
500 model to 150 seats in the series 400 jet.
   USAir, which traditionally has concentrated its flights in the
Northeast expanded into the fifth largest airline company last year
with the acquisition of PSA and Piedmont. While the three airlines
still operate as separate carriers there are plans to merge them
into a single carrier in the future.

   A general strike called to press for
the end of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's military rule lost steam
Thursday and the sponsors indicated they might end it.
   The indefinite stoppage began Monday and already has lasted
longer than any of five general strikes last year.
   A leader of the opposition National Civic Crusade told The
Associated Press actions by the United States and other countries
will become more important if internal pressure diminishes.
   Many stores that closed on previous days reopened Thursday. Two
factories resumed operations in the main industrial zone, which had
been a virtual ghost town since Monday. Management personnel at
others indicated they were preparing to resume production.
   Some supermarkets and pharmacies had closed, but were open for
business Thursday.
   The banking situation was confused. International banks opened
but limited the amount of withdrawals. Lines formed outside
privately owned local banks as word spread they intended to open,
but some still were closed in the afternoon.
   Riot police in trucks patrolled on Thursday in several
neighborhoods that were the scene of confrontations with
stone-throwing youths Tuesday and Wednesday. No violence was
reported.
   Members of the Civic Crusade predicted Wednesday night that
support for the strike would decline, but were encouraged Thursday
by reports that it had gained support outside the capital and
withheld a decision about ending it.
   Roberto Aleman, who heads the lawyers' component of the alliance
of 200 business, professional, labor and political groups, said
foreign pressure will be crucial in the coming days and weeks.
   ``Anything that tends to damage the government of Noriega, we
support,'' he said. He praised actions designed to freeze
Panamanian government funds deposited in several U.S. banks.
   ``The government will find itself besieged by economic and
diplomatic measures taken in the United States and Latin America,''
Aleman said. ``The measures will oblige the regime to take
extremely unpopular measures such as raising taxes and firing
public employees.''
   He predicted that would increase popular discontent and lead to
broader and more militant opposition.
   Eliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, said Wednesday the U.S. government is inclined to support
such efforts.
   Air Panama suspended daily flights to Miami, its only connection
with the United States. Sources at the state-owned airline said the
purpose was to avoid any U.S. attempt to embargo aircraft.
   Washington still considers Eric Arturo Delvalle the legitimate
president of Panama. He was ousted last Friday after trying to fire
Noriega, who commands the 15,000-member Defense Forces, which
include the military and police.
   Delvalle is in hiding in Panama.
   The new government named former Foreign Minister Aquilino Boyd
the new ambassador to Washington. It was not clear whether he would
try to take up the post still occupied by Delvalle's ambassador,
Juan Sosa.
   Noriega was indicted last month in Florida for alleged
involvement in smuggling cocaine from Colombia to the United
States. He also is charged with allowing drug traffickers to
launder profits in Panamanian banks.
   A Panama City newspaper quoted a member of the joint chiefs of
staff as denying reports that that Noriega was purging the armed
forces.
   National Assembly member Guillermo Cochez told a news conference
Wednesday the general ordered the early retirements of two colonels
and two majors whose loyalty was suspect. Cochez belongs to the
opposition Christian Democrats.
   Col. Leonidas Macias was quoted by the pro-government paper La
Estrella as saying: ``Everything is normal and no one has been
retired or dismissed.''

<HEAD>Markey Says Affidavit Reaffirms Need for Independent Seabrook
Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading nuclear power critic on Thursday
labeled the Nuclear Regulatory Commission an ``outlaw agency'' for
not launching an independent investigation following evidence of
drug and alcohol abuse at the Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   ``Like a mother who refuses to confront a child on drugs, the
NRC refuses to confront the possibility of danger at Seabrook,''
said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass. ``They have turned their backs
on the people of New England and ignored their own mandate as the
agency that insures nuclear plant safety.''
   Markey renewed his call for an independent investigation after
releasing an affidavit from John Powell, former assistant
construction director at the New Hampshire nuclear power plant,
that said a longtime Seabrook subcontractor was fired in 1986 for
alleged drug abuse by its employees.
   Powell's sworn affidavit backs up evidence Markey released
earlier this year, the congressman said.
   David Scanzoni, spokesman for plant operator New Hamsphire
Yankee, confirmed that Pittsburgh Testing Laboratories, hired in
1976 to test concrete used at the plant, was fired in 1986
following drug allegations. The allegations were never proven, he
said.
   Scanzoni said the work of Pittsburgh Testing, like other
Seabrook subcontractors, went through a series of rigorous tests
and internal checks.
   And he said the company's work was reviewed again by New
Hampshire Yankee following the drug allegations. Scanzoni said he
did not know if the NRC re-checked the work after Pittsburgh
Testing was dismissed.
   NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr., in a letter to Markey this week,
said there was no need for an independent review of Seabrook's
construction ``in light of the extensive safety reviews.''
   ``The NRC staff has carefully reviewed your report and advises
us that no new issues have been raised to support the contention
that the safe operation of the Seabrook plant is in question due to
construction deficiencies caused by drug or alcohol use,'' Zech
wrote.
   He said ``routine and special inspections'' showed that Seabrook
is a well-built and safe reactor.
   Scanzoni released a statement from Powell, who retired last
year, defending the company.
   ``No drug or alcohol problems at Seabrook have had any impact on
safety related systems or construction at Seabrook,'' Powell said.
``In general terms, there have been no major problems at Seabrook
in terms of substance abuse. There have been some minor drug and
alcohol incidents, but action was taken immediately.''
   Scanzoni refuted the congressman's charges that New Hampshire
Yankee tried to cover up drug problems at the plant, noting that
most of the documents cited by Markey came from the company.

<HEAD>Witness Testifies About Mecham Response to Probe of Death Threat</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Senate refusing to hear evidence of
witness' sex life. Edits throughout to tighten. No pickup.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arizona Senate on Thursday rejected an
attempt by Gov. Evan Mecham's lawyers to introduce evidence at his
impeachment trial about a key witness' sex life.
   ``This is neither a circus nor another episode of Peyton
Place,'' said Democratic Sen. Jesus ``Chuy'' Higuera, arguing
against admission of the affidavit offered by the first-term
Republican governor's lawyers.
   The Senate voted 21-8 against hearing the evidence but decided
26-3 to ask the Maricopa County attorney to investigate the conduct
of the witness, Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead.
   Milstead is expected to testify about an allegation that Mecham
ordered him not to cooperate with a probe of an alleged death
threat against a former Mecham aide who was testifying before a
grand jury investigating the governor.
   ``Clearly, the introduction of this evidence would make these
proceedings more sensational and titillating,'' said Republican
Sen. Greg Lunn.
   But he added: ``I don't believe the entire life of Director
Milstead is on trial. The character and actions of Governor Mecham
are on trial.''
   Lunn said evidence of an alleged 1982 sexual affair between
Milstead and a former DPS employee would be clearly irrelevant and
unfair.
   ``We've already done more for Ralph Milstead's sex life than a
centerfold in Cosmopolitan,'' said an exasperated Republican Sen.
John Mawhinney.
   Republican Sen. Peter Kay had spurred debate on the issue when
he moved for admission of the affidavit. He said Milstead's sex
life was relevant to his character.
   The former DPS employee had reportedly claimed that Milstead had
sex with her while he was married and once threatened her if she
revealed their affair.
   Moments after debate ended on the sex matter, an unidentified
man in the spectator's gallery screamed out: ``You make me sick! I
have to get out of here!''
   The trial was recessed while the man was ushered out and taken
to a room for questioning. He did not resist.
   Earlier, the Senate heard testimony that Mecham tried to block
the state attorney general's investigation of the alleged death
threat because he believed the prosecutor was ``out to get him.''
   James Chilcoat, DPS assistant deputy director, testified he was
told by Milstead that Mecham instructed Milstead not to cooperate
with the attorney general's office.
   Meanwhile, Mecham took his case to the public, appearing on
three national television shows Thursday morning a few hours after
he addressed a cheering crowd of 4,000 supporters at a rally
Wednesday night.
   Mecham, who has stayed away from his impeachment trial since it
began Monday, also is accused of concealing a $350,000 campaign
loan and of misusing $80,000 in state money by loaning it to his
auto dealership.
   Mecham, 63, is the first U.S. governor to face an impeachment
trial in 60 years. He also faces a May 17 recall election and a
March 22 trial on felony charges accusing him of concealing the
loan.
   Chilcoat, a DPS lieutenant colonel, gave details of the alleged
threat similar to those related by two other DPS officers who
testified earlier.
   He said he was told that Lee Watkins, then Mecham's prison
construction chief, threatened in November that a Mecham staffer
then testifying before a grand jury about the campaign loan might
``go on a long boat ride'' or ``wind up at the bottom of a river''
if she continued talking.
   ``The department could see some embarrassment coming to the
governor's office and obviously we were going to get blamed for
that,'' Chilcoat said. ``We had told the governor (about the
threat) to reduce his risk and we were at a loss as to why he
hadn't done anything.''
   Chilcoat said Milstead personally gave Mecham the information
and came back dismayed.
   ``He (Milstead) said the governor had instructed him not to go
to the attorney general's office, not to help those people out
there, that they were out to get him,'' Chilcoat said.
   A two-thirds vote of the Senate would be required to convict
Mecham on any count of the 23 articles of impeachment and remove
him from office. The Senate could, by another two-thirds vote, then
bar Mecham for life from holding any state office.
   Mecham has remained highly visible since his trial began. On the
network TV morning shows he said, ``I haven't broken any laws,''
and blamed Arizona newspapers for his problems.
   Mecham was asked on ABC about the impact of former U.S. Sen.
Barry Goldwater's view that Mecham should resign. ``Barry doesn't
know what's going on,'' Mecham said. ``He's sort of past history.''

<HEAD>Shultz Urges Palestinians To Form Delegation With Jordan</HEAD>

comments. No pickup</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Thursday
renewed an American drive to open Arab-Israeli peace talks by
urging Palestinian Arabs to form a joint delegation with Jordan for
negotiations.
   ``Jordan, with Palestinians, is a good concept,'' Shultz said.
He cited family and cultural ties between Palestinians living in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza and those living in Jordan.
   ``The structure is there, so there is a lot to be said for this
approach,'' Shultz said on a flight to Israel following a meeting
in London with Jordan's King Hussein. ``I think it is a good one.''
   He described his two-hour meeting with the king as ``very
worthwhile,'' but declined to give details to reporters traveling
to the Middle East with him.
   Pleading that the situation was delicate, the secretary also
would not say what approaches he had in mind for Israel's Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, whom he
will meet separately on Friday.
   But Shultz hinted he was making headway in his effort to convene
negotiations within a month.
   Peres met Shultz on his arrival Thursday night, but no airport
statements were issued.
   From Israel, Shultz plans to embark on quick flights to Syria
and Egypt for more talks, then return to Washington over the
weekend.
   President Reagan, in Belgium for a North Atlantic Treaty
Organization summit, announced Wednesday he was sending Shultz for
added talks with Mideast leaders. Shultz returned to the shuttle he
began earlier this week.
   The U.S. proposal seeks to defuse the explosive situation in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip by opening talks soon on how the 1.5
million Palestinians in the occupied territories could control
their daily affairs.
   According to the U.S. plan, the Israelis, Jordanians and
Palestinians would then open negotiations in December on an overall
peace settlement.
   Israel took the lands from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   ``We are at an interesting and important time in this
negotiation,'' Shultz said Thursday. ``And the best thing I can do
as far as maximizing the prospects of getting anywhere is not to
talk about it.''
   Still, Shultz spoke forcefully about the merits of a joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. He urged all parties involved to
adopt realistic goals.
   ``What I'm trying to do is to get people, all of whom have
dreams, to focus on the dreams that have a foundation of reality .
.. as I go around that is the message I try to carry,'' he said.
   The composition of the Arab delgation that would talk peace with
Israel is a major issue confronting Shultz on his swing through the
region.
   Jordan and Syria demand a role for the Palestine Liberation
Organization. Reporters in Amman with Shultz last week were
informed Jordan would no longer press the PLO to agree to a joint
delegation.
   The issue is important because the United States and Israel both
refuse to negotiate with an organization committed to dismantling
the Jewish state.
   Shultz said all the parties _ the United States, Israel, Jordan
and Egypt _agreed Palestinians ``have to have a say'' in the
negotiations.
   ``To a very considerable degree,'' Shultz said,``it's their
rights, their human condition that's involved. ... By including
them in a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, you are making
arrangements for that and I think that can work.''
   At a news conference earlier in Brussels, Shultz took a tough
stance on the PLO while declaring that ``any suitable settlement
has to deal the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.''
   Shultz insisted U.S. policy toward the PLO had not changed since
a 1975 law, enacted as a guarantee to Israel, prohibited
negotiating with the PLO so long as Yasser Arafat's organization
did not recognize Israel's right to exist.
   But Shultz said he wanted to meet with Palestinians as soon as
possible, even though a session could not be arranged right away.

   A former pro football player was
indicted Wednesday on charges of murdering a man 31 years ago in a
case reopened at the request of the victim's mother.
   Bobby Hoppe, 53, was released on $7,500 bail Wednesday in the
1957 slaying of Teddy Donald Hudson. The 24-year-old Hudson was
killed by a shotgun blast fired into his car as he drove down a
neighborhood street, police said.
   The charges against Hoppe, a former Washington Redskins player
who is now athletic director at Chattanooga State Technical
Community College, came 14 months after police reopened the case at
the request of Georgia Hudson.
   Police would not say what led them to arrest Hoppe, who had been
a suspect during the original investigation, and gave no motive for
the slaying.
   Police initially thought the death might be liquor-related,
since in 1953 Hudson was sentenced to prison on a liquor conviction
and was a reputed whiskey runner.
   In addition, allegations were made during the original
investigation that Hoppe shot Hudson over Hoppe's sister, whom
Hudson was dating, but there wasn't enough evidence for an arrest,
said police spokesman Freeman Cooper.
   Hoppe declined to talk about the case. His lawyer, Leroy
Phillips, said only that he is convinced of Hoppe's innocence.
   At the time of the slaying, Hoppe was a starting running back at
Auburn University, then called Alabama Polytechnic Institute. He
was on the team that won the 1957 national championship.
   After playing briefly for the Redskins, Hoppe was a teacher,
coach and administrator at several high schools in Chattanooga and
in Georgia.
   Mrs. Hudson asked police to reopen the case after a meeting of
Families and Friends of Murder Victims, a support and counseling
group. The case was taken up by two detectives on a newly-formed
task force on long-unsolved murders.
   Hoppe will be tried under state law as it existed in 1957, which
means that he could receive 20 years to life in prison. Current law
allows the death penalty.

<HEAD>Gephardt Challenges Dukakis on PAC Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Gephardt parried a television
attack on his presidential campaign with a challenge Thursday,
saying he'd return PAC contributions if Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis returned every dollar from those who do business with the
state of Massachusetts.
   Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach said the campaign has taken no
money from any corporate PACs or registered lobbyists in
Massachusetts.
   The Missouri congressman said he was defending his record
against his rival's latest television advertisements, which implied
he might have trouble representing American workers while accepting
funds from their employers.
   ``I'll give back every penny of money that I've gotten from
political action funds if he will return the money to all the
people who have given him money who do business with or are
licensed by the state of Massachusetts,'' Gephardt said in a short
airport stop at Baltimore-Washington International Airport.
   Gephardt, who made two whistlestops in Maryland five days before
Super Tuesday balloting, has taken third place to Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson among likely Maryland primary voters, according to the
latest Baltimore Evening Sun polls.
   After his airport news conference, he paid a courtesy visit to
Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer. Gephardt said he didn't come
seeking an endorsement, and he didn't get one from the governor,
who said again he will remain neutral at least through the Maryland
primary.
   The campaign exchanges between him and Dukakis have turned
increasingly scrappy as Super Tuesday nears.
   ``We will make public tomorrow (Friday) a partial list of some
of the interests that have given money to his campaign,'' Gephardt
told reporters gathered in a small airport terminal. ``He's got
appointees of his own state government who are awarding contracts
to many of the people who have given money to his campaign. Is that
a conflict of interest? I think that's a legitimate question.''
   The Missouri congressman said he not let special interests
dictate his votes.
   ``I've never made a decision in my public life based on those
contributions,'' he said. ``I have fought for a new trade policy. I
have fought for a new tax policy and in my whole career I've fought
against vested interests and the establishment of this country. And
I find it odd that now Gov. Dukakis calls it into question whether
or not I have been the one who fights for the working people of
this country,'' he said.
   Gephardt said only 5 percent of the $5 million to $6 million
raised in his campaign for the presidency has come from PACs and is
documented in the public record.
   Responding to Dukakis' latest attack that his oil import fee
proposal would saddle Americans with a $50 billion burden, he said
the types of oil industry incentives supported by Dukakis haven't
worked in the past. He defended imposition of an oil import fee,
saying it wouldn't cost consumers in the long run.
   ``The question is, do you want to pay 10 cents more a gallon now
for gasoline and have the money all go to our treasury, or do you
want to sit here and be vulnerable to OPEC and wait for a few years
and let OPEC raise the price by 40 or 50 cents a gallon and take
all the money to OPEC?''

<HEAD>GSA Chief Resigns After Three Years on Job</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terence C. Golden, who has been administrator
of the General Services Administration for nearly three years,
resigned Thursday because of his wife's health, a GSA spokesman
said.
   Golden, 43, became chief of the agency in June 1985, after
serving as assistant secretary for administration at the Treasury
Department. Before joining the government in March 1984, he was a
residential developer for a large Dallas firm.
   The GSA is the government's housekeeping agency. It owns or
leases 6,800 buildings nationwide.
   GSA spokesman Joseph Slye said Golden sent his resignation in a
letter to the White House. The letter was not released. The
resignation is effective March 18, he said.
   The agency recently has been under attack for its handling of
$55 million in government telecommunications contracts. The GSA's
inspector general, the Justice Department and a Senate committee
are investigating allegations that agency employees leaked
confidential information to competitors during bidding for the
contracts.
   The GSA's handling of that contract is being scrutinized because
the agency is also taking bids on a contract worth as much as $25
billion over 10 years to replace the government's phone network.
   At the GSA, Golden opened 10 child-care centers in federal
workplaces around the country and 25 more are planned for this
year. He got Congress to authorize $350 million to complete the
Federal Triangle complex of buildings on Pennsylvania Avenue, which
was begun during the Roosevelt administration.
   In February 1987, he restricted smoking for 890,000 federal
workers to designated areas in government buildings.
   The following May, he adopted new telephone regulations allowing
federal workers to make daily phone calls home to check on
children, spouses and day-care centers. Formerly they could only
call home in emergencies.
   He also persuaded Congress and the president to provide more
generous travel expenses to federal workers.

   ``I came face to face with death at 13 years
old,'' Ryan White told the White House AIDS commission Thursday.
   That was three years ago when he was diagnosed as having the
deadly disease during surgery to remove part of his lung because of
pneumonia. Doctors gave him six months to live.
   But the Indiana youngster told the panel he decided instead ``to
live a normal life, go to school, be with my friends and enjoy
day-to-day activities.''
   As it turned out, those modest goals were not so easy to attain,
mostly because of the ridicule heaped on him by others in Kokomo.
   ``Because of the lack of education on AIDS, discrimination,
fear, panic and lies surrounded me,'' he told the commission. ``I
was labeled a trouble-maker, my mom an unfit mother and I was not
welcome anywhere. People would get up and leave so they would not
have to sit anywhere near me. Even at church, people would not
shake my hand.''
   Finally, last summer, Ryan, his mother and sister decided to
move to another Indiana town _ Cicero. There things were different.
   They had the good fortune to move three doors away from Jill
Stewart, who had just been elected president of the student council
and welcomed Ryan as a neighbor.
   She sat beside him Thursday while Ryan told his story, and then
she told her own _ about how the 600 students at Hamilton Heights
High School they attend in nearby Arcadia ``had witnessed Ryan's
pain in his former community'' and how they decided ``there was no
reason for Ryan to go through that pain again.''
   She told how school officials worked with the student council
and parents to educate the community about acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. Eventually, she said, the students ran out of
questions to ask about AIDS, which is an incurable disease that is
spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes
shared by drug abusers and infected blood or blood products.
   ``By this time, they were asking how they could help Ryan,'' she
said.
   Ryan said of his life: ``I'm a normal, happy teen-ager again. I
have a learner's permit, I attend sports functions and dances. I
made the honor role just recently, with two As and two Bs. ... I
believe in myself as I look forward to graduating ... in 1991.''
   Miss Stewart, a 17-year-old senior who aspires to study human
genetics _ or maybe law _ told the panel her story was intended to
show how AIDS education in the schools can work to head off
discrimination. That was part of the speech she had handwritten on
a green-and-white sheaf of computer printer paper.
   Then she ad libbed a few lines.
   In the end, she said, Ryan _ who contracted the virus through
contaminated blood agents given for threatment of the hemophilia he
was born with _ helped his new classmates more than they helped him.
   ``No one realizes how much he has done for us,'' she said. ``He
helps us put life in perspective in so many ways. These things you
cannot measure.''
   When the teen-agers were finished, the members of the White
House commission applauded.

   Industrial-state lawmakers, citing national

protect the domestic bearing industry against cheaper imports that
are driving American manufacturers out of business.
   ``If we lose our domestic bearing industry, our military would
become dangerously dependent on foreign nations to supply us with
these vital components,'' said Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-Conn., and
38 other lawmakers in letters to Commerce Secretary C. William
Verity Jr. and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci.
   Bearings are used in fighter jets, tanks, submarines, missiles
and other defense systems. Foreign competition has ``gravely
injured'' U.S. manufacturers, Mrs. Johnson said.
   In July, the industry asked the Commerce Department to impose
import restrictions on overseas bearing makers, but no action has
been taken.
   Mrs. Johnson, who represents a western Connecticut district with
several major bearing employers, said nearly 65 percent of ball
bearings sold in the United States now come from abroad, and that
figure is growing.
   The congresswoman cited a 1986 Defense Department study that
concluded bearings ``are a strategic industry, critical to the
nation's defense.'' And the Pentagon found that the domestic
bearing industry is in ``imminent danger of being unable to support
national defense needs'' and urged immediate action.
   ``Nonetheless, two years after the release of this report, the
federal government has still not implemented any steps to assist
the bearing industry,'' Mrs. Johnson said.
   The industry filed for temporary relief under the Trade
Expansion Act of 1962 to provide U.S. companies with enough time to
modernize.
   The Anti-Friction Bearing Manufacturers Association, which
represents 43 companies nationwide, asked the Commerce Department
last summer to restrict foreign imports to 32 percent of the
domestic ball bearing market and 18 percent of the roller bearing
market. Imports make up about 40 percent of the roller bearing
market, Mrs. Johnson said.
   The Commerce Department has until July to make a recommendation
to President Reagan, but Mrs. Johnson has lobbied Verity to
expedite the process and was ``informally assured'' by the
department that it would be moved swiftly, according to Johnson
aide Caroline Willson.

   Jesse Jackson, sweeping through country
hard hit by depressed oil and farm prices, said Thursday he wants
to revitalize the U.S. oil industry and economy with a hemispheric
energy alliance.
   The Democratic presidential candidate said his proposal for a
Pan-American energy security alliance, in cooperation with Canada
and the Latin countries, would free the United States from reliance
on the OPEC nations.
   He said it could also be part of an overall cooperative strategy
to help Latin countries reduce their debt so that they could
purchase more American products, thereby reducing the U.S. deficit.
   Jackson picked up the endorsement of veteran state Sen. Gene
Stipe, who has served in the statehouse for 40 years, and a handful
of other legislators here.
   ``He is the best thing in the race,'' said Stipe, who until
recently had supported Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   Stipe said he now backs Jackson because ``I can see he has a
chance to be president. He has the momentum. After Super Tuesday,
they're not going to be able to stop him.''
   He predicted other white Oklahomans would also back Jackson and
help him in the state's Super Tuesday primary.
   Later, at the University of Arkansas, Jackson was endorsed by
John J. Hooker, a former Tennnessee gubernatorial candidate who
said he was representative of many more whites from his home state
who supported Jackson.
   ``After Super Tuesday, the rebels are going to come to Jesse by
the hundreds of thousands,'' he said to cheers.
   Hooker said Jackson's success in five Northern states with
voting-age populations of 1 percent or less had caught the
attention of many whites who did not support Jackson in his 1984
race.
   In an interview later, Jackson declined to specify what his
expectations were for Super Tuesday but expressed cautious optimism
that he would pick up significant white votes.
   ``I can only say that I'm reaching out,'' he told The Associated
Press.
   Jackson said ``one can never be so certain about what's going to
happen Tuesday,'' but added: ``My sense is there's a higher comfort
level'' among whites for his candidacy.
   Jackson is trying to pull white voters into his camp, and
campaign manager Gerald Austin said Jackson's strategy is to pull
in up to 10 percent of the white vote as well as his solid base of
black support on Super Tuesday.
   At the state capitol, Jackson was greeted by a standing ovation
from a joint session of the legislature. He teased some lawmakers
for wearing campaign buttons of other presidential contenders,
telling them not to support candidates that ``are not viable.''
   Jackson is spending most of the pre-Super Tuesday campaign days
bouncing across what he calls ``the new South'' and its bordering
states. He is intent on making inroads in 105 congressional
districts where his campaign sees a chance to gain a significant
part of the 1,307 delegates up for grabs on Tuesday.
   His campaign on Friday will launch a $100,000 TV campaign in
eight states, one featuring endorsements by comedian Bill Cosby and
other spots highlighting Jackson's accomplishments.
   Jackson focuses on the new South, saying that voting rights and
other freedoms have been won by blacks but economic inequity
amounts to a new form of slavery.
   He is trying to pull white voters into his campaign for
``economic justice.''
   His prospects in Oklahoma, where more than 30 banks closed last
year, are good, according to Stipe, although Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
of Tennessee and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri are also strong.

   Protesters demanding
lower prices set fire to stores in a third day of disturbances
Thursday. A merchant killed one protester and wounded another,
authorities said.
   Police said 300 people were arrested in Santiago, the Caribbean
nation's second-largest city, where soldiers fired tear gas to
disperse rioters. Demonstrations were also reported in slum
sections of Santo Domingo, the capital.
   A Roman Catholic Church leader, Monsignor Agripino Nunez
Collado, called on leaders of government, labor, business and the
church to begin talks on the demonstrations and the country's
economic problems.
   Protests against inflation broke out last week in eight of the
26 Dominican provinces, leaving five people dead and 20 injured. On
Saturday, President Joaquin Balaguer announced a 25 percent
increase in the monthly minimum wage to about $75, but new
demonstrations broke out this week.
   On Thursday, protesters set fire to an undetermined number of
stores in Santiago and hurled firebombs at businesses in Santo
Domingo.
   A merchant in the city fired a gun into a mob that tried to burn
down his store, killing Miguel Cruz Vazquez, 21, and wounding
Andres Antonio Batista, 18, police said.
   Protest organizers, grouped as the Front for Popular Resistance
and Popular Unity Council, said demonstrations would continue
Friday and Saturday if the government did not move to curb
inflation.
   The government has made no comment on the latest violence. Last
week, Balaguer threatened to call out the army to contain unrest.
   Inflation was 30 percent last year, according to private
economists, and might top 50 percent this year.
   The protests have been the worst since Balaguer took office 1{
years ago in the nation of more than 6.5 million people.

   The nation's largest labor
federation, barred from all political activity, said Thursday it
would hold a national congress in April to discuss the ban.
   The federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
threatened a three-day protest if the April 11-13 meeting is
prohibited. It puts its membership at 750,000.
   Other organizations also announced plans to defy the
government's emergency regulations. Eighteen opposition groups were
barred last week from conducting any activity not approved by the
government.
   The South African Youth Congress said it was changing its name
in an attempt to get around the restrictions.
   Nkosi Molala, president of the newly banned Azanian Peoples
Organization, said he and two colleagues were detained by police
for most of the day and questioned about a new group, the Azanian
Coordinating Committee. He said police warned him the new group
would be banned, too, if it was a renamed version of the restricted
organization.
   The South African Council of Churches is one of several groups
which promised to take over projects of the 18 banned
organizations. It said it defied a government order to submit
copies of its monthly journal, Ecunews, for review under emergency
censorship laws.
   The church council said it was notified by Minister of Home
Affairs Stoffel Botha it had committed a criminal offense and he
threatened legal action.
   The council is a coalition of most Protestant churches in South
Africa, except for the white Dutch Reformed Church.
   The council said it told Botha it would not comply with any
order under the state of emergency proclamation because the
20-month-old decree violated ``the Christian understanding of
justice,'' by eliminating the right of the accused to defend
themselves in open court.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions has called for
international disinvestment from South African business,
redistribution of wealth to the workers and a complete boycott of
South Africa to pressure the government to change laws that deny a
national vote to the black majority of 26 million.
   The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services.
   Also on Thursday:
   _Dr. Ivan Toms, a 35-year-old white doctor who has run a clinic
in the Cape Town black township of Crossroads since 1980, was
sentenced to 630 days in prison for refusing to serve, even as a
non-combatant, in the South African Defense Force. Toms said he
objected to stationing white conscripts in black townships, in the
South African-occupied territory of Namibia and in neighboring
Angola.
   _A judge ruled that police who hid behind crates in a truck to
entrap stone-throwing youths were to blame for three deaths when
they fired on a crowd in the 1985 ``Trojan Horse'' incident in
Athlone, a mixed-race township outside Cape Town. In an inquest,
Magistrate Gert Hoffmann ruled the police action was unreasonable
and referred the case to the attorney general for investigation of
criminal charges.

Prevention</HEAD>

   Education Secretary William J. Bennett told
the White House AIDS commission Thursday he and Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop are in 95 percent agreement about how to attack the
spread of the disease.
   As for the other 5 percent, Bennett suggested it is OK for a
doctor and an educator to differ on what to emphasize in their
messages to the American public.
   ``They can handle it,'' he said.
   Bennett's comments were in response to a statement by retired
Adm. James D. Watkins, chairman of the commission, that many
witnesses had told the panel differences among top federal
officials were sending ``equivocal messages'' on AIDS education and
prevention.
   During a brief evening session, the commission unanimously
adopted 60 pages of recommendations Watkins made last week as the
basis for an interim report to be forwarded to President Reagan
next week.
   The formal report closely follows the Watkins draft, including
his call for an additional $20 billion in state and federal
spending over the next decade to combat intravenous drug abuse and
improve treatment for AIDS patients.
   The most rapid spread of the disease is now occurring among
intravenous drugs abusers who catch AIDS by sharing contaminated
needles and then pass the virus to their sexual partners and
offspring.
   Despite the call for sharply higher spending, the interim report
is viewed as relatively uncontroversial compared with the issues
Watkins says the panel will address in its final report, such as
testing, anti-discrimination and preventive education.
   The version approved by the panel did not delete any of Watkins'
specific recommendations, but contained additional wording in
several sections.
   For example, a paragraph was added to the introduction to
emphasize ``that available data do not provide a basis for comfort
or complacency to any segment of our society. ... We express our
concern that inaccurate and misleading statements suggesting that
(the virus) cannot be spread through heterosexual activity could
stimulate transmission among those who would see such reports as
bases for ignoring the danger that does, in fact, exist.''
   Koop had told the panel Tuesday he was ``outraged'' at media
reports downplaying the danger of the virus spreading through
vaginal intercourse.
   In a section that concentrates on the danger of intravenous drug
users spreading the disease by sharing needles, language was added
to say: ``In addition to direct transmission, the use of drugs that
impair judgment can contribute to sexual transmission.''
   Commissioner Theresa L. Crenshaw, a physician who specializes in
sex therapy, has expressed concern at several hearings that too
much alcohol or marijuana use can lead people to do things they
would not do if they were sober.
   The perfunctory evening session to adopt the final report
followed a full day of hearings that featured Bennett and, on a
separate panel, Ryan White, an Indiana teen-ager who contracted
AIDS during treatment for hemophilia.
   The most publicized difference between Koop and Bennett is over
what emphasis to put on use of condoms and spermicides to prevent
the spread of AIDS among sexually active people.
   ``Whether it (the difference) is real or non-substantive, it is
a real perception out there,'' Watkins said.
   ``Dr. Koop and I are very close, extremely close,'' Bennett
said. ``I think Koop and I agree 95 percent of the way. It's all
right for the surgeon general and the secretary of education to
speak a little differently about these things.''
   He cited a hypothetical situation of a youngster discussing
``what he or she is doing'' with a doctor and with a counselor.
   ``The doctor's advice would probably emphasize the medical
aspects, as it should,'' said Bennett. ``The teacher or counselor's
advice might emphasize other things. Some shading of difference is
OK. Some measure of disagreement is OK.''
   ``When the American people ask for leadership, they are not
saying, `We're a bunch of dummies, tell us what to think,'''
Bennett said. ``They want to know our best thinking. And if our
best thinking diverges on some points, they can handle it.''
   Bennett said he does not dispute Koop's position that sexually
active people, including teen-agers, must be aware that condom and
spermicide use, although imperfect, are the only protection against
contracting AIDS sexually.
   The difference, especially involving adolescents, is where to
put the emphasis, Bennett said.
   What he does not condone, the education chief said, is teachers
going through ``a kind of incantation'' on abstinence and sexual
monogamy in AIDS prevention classes, ``then proceeding for the rest
of the class to talk (to teen-agers) about how to protect
themselves.''
   ``It's like saying, don't smoke, but if you do, smoke low tar.
Don't drink, but if you do, keep it to 70 proof. I think these are
equivocal messages.''
   Koop told the commission earlier in the week that while he also
believes the best advice is abstinence, or at least monogamy, ``I
think it is also realistic to understand that sexually active
teen-agers are unlikely to reverse their pattern and go backward,
and therefore prevention for them has to be our third line of
defense. ... We have to teach them about the protection of
themselves and others through the use of condoms and spermicides.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a incurable,
contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering
it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.
   The disease is spread most often through sexual contact, needles
or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products, and from infected pregnant women to their offspring.

with 73 percent of the vote.
   Diouf won Sunday's elections with 828,301 of the 1,135,501 votes

   Two other candidates split the remaining votes.
   Results for the 120-seat National Assembly were to be announced

   Opposition leaders, including Wade, claimed the voting was
rigged. They have been detained since violent clashes between
stone-throwing youths and riot police broke out Monday and Tuesday.
The violence followed a preliminary government announcement that
Diouf was re-elected.

   A storm dumped freezing rain and up to 6 inches of snow on the
East and Midwest on Thursday, downing power lines and causing
hundreds of traffic accidents.
   Meanwhile, rain and thunderstorms battered the central Gulf
Coast region. During a six-hour period ending at 1 p.m. EST,
Pensacola, Fla., had 1.46 inches of rain, Valparaiso, Fla., 1.19
inches and Milton, Fla., .90 inches.
   Dry weather prevailed over much of the rest of the nation.
   In Indiana, downed tree limbs interrupted power in parts of
Indianapolis. Up to 4 inches of snow fell on Kokomo and 3 inches on
Lafayette, Sheridan, Portland and Crawfordsville.
   Power outages also hit thousands of homes in central Illinois.
   Freezing rain, sleet and snow fell on central Ohio, where up to
5 inches of snow were expected.
   Up to 5 inches of snow fell in eastern Kansas, and more than 6
inches fell across parts of Oklahoma and Texas.
   A band of snow extended from western Pennsylvania through
central Illinois to west-central Texas, with freezing rain reported
from Ohio to Missouri. Rain and snow also fell over Montana.
   Earlier, the storm dumped up 13 inches on parts of the Texas
Panhandle, thunderstorms triggered flash floods in east Texas and a
tornado ripped the roofs off mobile homes near Galveston. The
weather was blamed for at least four traffic deaths.
   Up to 4 inches of snow were expected in parts of West Virginia
and up to 6 inches in northeastern Pennsylvania. Up to six inches
were possible in southeastern New York state.
   Temperatures were above 50 degrees from south-central Texas to
the southern and middle Atlantic Coast, with 70s in Louisiana,
Mississippi and Florida. Temperatures generally were below freezing
from the upper half of the Mississippi Valley to northern New
England, with teens across northern sections of the Great Lakes
region.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 17
degrees at Houghton, Minn., to 86 degrees at the southwest Florida
regional airport in Fort Myers.
   The low for the nation was 14 degrees below zero at
International Falls, Minn.
   Friday's forecast called for rain extending from the lower and
middle Mississippi Valley to northern Florida, the Carolinas and
the mid-Atlantic Coast, with thunderstorms from Alabama to
Virginia. Snow will extend from northern Ohio to New Jersey. Rain
and snow will extend from Wyoming across the northern Plains, with
snow most likely in Wyoming. Rain will extend from the northern and
central Pacific Coast to northwest Montana, with rain likely in
Washington and western Oregon. Fair to partly sunny skies will
prevail across the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures will remain below 50 from the northern and central
Rockies to the middle and northern Atlantic Coast. Highs will be in
the 30s and upper 20s from eastern Montana through the upper half
of the Mississippi Valley to New England; above 60 from California
through southern New Mexico and across the lower Mississippi Valley
to the southern Atlantic Coast, and in the 70s in Southern
California, southwestern Arizona and extreme southern Texas, and
from southern Louisiana to Florida and southern Georgia.

   Six Republican and Democratic congressmen
introduced a bill Thursday to impose an ``immediate, dramatic and
devastating'' trade, air travel and currency embargo against the
regime of Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The lawmakers said they would seek speedy congressional approval
of the embargo bill.
   But they said they also hoped to prod President Reagan to act
independently to adopt a far stronger series of punitive sanctions
against the Noriega regime than he has approved to date.
   The proposed embargo would bar all imports from Panama, prohibit
all U.S. exports to that nation, bar all air travel between the two
countries and prohibit U.S. banks from transferring any funds to
Panama and its banking system.
   ``By stopping the transfer of funds from U.S. banks to Panama,
we go for the jugular,'' said Sen. Alfonse D-Amato, R-N.Y., a
principal sponsor of the embargo plan.
   ``Because of Panama's heavy reliance on its economic ties with
the United States, the impact of a U.S. trade embargo would be
immediate, dramatic and devastating to Noriega and his cohorts,''
D'Amato said.
   Panamanian opposition leader Ricardo Arias Calderon, president
of the Christian Democratic Party, told reporters later that a
trade embargo would be ``strong medicine'' but that such a remedy
is sometimes needed for people to regain their health.
   Other sponsors of the embargo bill are Sens. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass.; David Durenberger, R-Minn.; Bob Graham, D-Fla.; John
Kerry, D-Mass.; and Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   The senators told reporters they introduced the embargo
legislation at the specific request of Eric Arturo Devalle, who was
ousted as Panama's president after attempting to remove Noriega as
commander of Panama's defense forces.
   Noriega was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami last month
for accepting $4.6 million to protect international drug
traffickers using Panama as safe haven.
   Kerry said that imposing the embargo gives the United States the
``best chance'' of removing Noriega but provides no guarantee of
that result.
   But D'Amato predicted imposing the embargo ``would spell the end
of Noriega within a matter of days.''
   D'Amato said the proposed ban on bank transfers to Panama will
worsen Pananama's banking crisis and cash shortage.
   He said it would represent an important blow at a banking system
he said has been used as a conduit for laundering billions of
dollars in proceeds from illicit drug sales in the United States.
   A ban on Panamanian goods will paralyze a $412 million market
representing 60 percent of Panama's total exports, D'Amato said. A
ban on U.S. exports to Panama will affect a 30 percent slice of all
Panamanian imports, he said.
   Delvalle's representatives have been attempting to seize cotrol
of Panamanian government assets in the United States through court
action, saying the new government took power illegally.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the
administration had taken measures to prevent the new government
from gaining access to official Panamanian funds in U.S. banks.
   She said Deputy Secretary John C. Whitehead has signed a
document certifying the administration's position that Ambassador
Juan B. Sosa has full authority over Panamanian assets in any
Federal Reserve Bank or federally insured bank, ``to ensure that
Panamanian government funds in U.S. banks are not removed by the
Noriega regime.''
   Sosa has estimated that Panamanian government deposits in U.S.
banks total about $50 million.
   At a news conference Thursday night at the Panamanian Embassy,
an attorney for Delvalle said federal courts in New York and Boston
have issued temporary restraining orders to prevent the transfer of
official Panamanian funds on deposit in U.S. banks to the
Panamanian government.
   ``We believe that whatever funds are in those institutions are
at this point frozen and cannot be transmitted to the Noriega
regime,'' said lawyer Daniel Resnick.
   Ms. Oakley also said that, at Sosa's request, 17 Panamanian
consular officers in the United States are no longer being
recognized as representatives of that government.
   Mrs. Oakley said there has been no final decision on a proposal
by Delvalle's representatives that a $7 million fee for Panama
Canal operations due the Panamanian government on March 15 be
withheld.
   But, she said, ``We have every feeling that the requests
probably are going to be honored.''
   In Brussels on Thursday, Reagan gave a one-word answer when
asked whether he felt Noriega should be replaced: ``Yes.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who was with Reagan at the
NATO summit, called Noriega ``bad news'' but indicated that the
administration must move cautiously in taking action against him.
   ``We want to do it properly, we want to do it right, we want to
do it effectively,'' Shultz said. His tone contrasted sharply with
that of Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, who has said
the administration is prepared to abide by the wishes of Delvalle,
whom it still regards as the constitutional leader of Panama.
   Reagan's national security adviser, Colin L. Powell, told
reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Washington that there
was no obvious successor to Noriega in Panama.
   ``There is no apparent leader _ military or civilian _ waiting
in the wings that you can have any reasonable form of assurance to
say, `That's the guy who can succeed Noriega.' So even if Noriega
should leave, we are anticipating a period of instability,'' Powell
said.
   In a another development, the chairman of a House Foreign
Affairs task force on international narcotics control said he will
ask Congress to repudiate Reagan's recent certification of five
Latin American nations as having fully cooperated with U.S. efforts
to eradicate narcotics cultivation and trafficking.
   Task force chairman Rep. Lawrence J. Smith, D-Fla., said he will
introduce legislation next week to reverse the administration's
action and decertify Mexico, Bolivia, Peru, Uruguay and the Bahamas.
   He said the evidence is clear to him that none are in full
cooperation with U.S. anti-narcotics efforts.
   Smith said he also is considering adding Laos and Burma to the
list of allegedly uncooperative nations but said they pose special
problems and that further study is needed before a decision is made.
   The congressman said his list does not include Colombia, whose
government he said has tried to cooperate in eradicating narcotics
cultivation despite intensive pressure from criminal narcotics
cartels headquartered in the country.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Drives Bulldozer To Knock Down Prison Gate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi climbed onto a bulldozer and
knocked down the gate of a Tripoli prison Thursday as thousands of
Libyans cheered, a Western diplomat said.
   The official Libyan news agency JANA, monitored in Rome, said
400 inmates were freed after Gadhafi ``demolished'' the prison with
the bulldozer. It said the former prisoners chanted slogans hailing
``the festival of liberty.''
   The Western European diplomat said he saw dozens of men with
crewcuts come pouring from the prison, to be joyously greeted by
relatives.
   The diplomat was reached by telephone by The Associated Press in
Rome. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said about 50 other people, who appeared to be Gadhafi aides,
also drove bulldozers during the rally to knock down a wall
surrounding the prison.
   The diplomat said Gadhafi, clad in a military jacket and slacks,
gave a 30-minute speech to the crowd in which the Libyan leader
praised his own record as leader of the 1969 revolution that
brought him to power.
   On Wednesday night, Gadhafi said in a speech that he was
releasing all Libyan prisoners except those accused of plotting
with foreign countries, according to JANA. He promised to destroy
the prison and invited prisoners' relatives to watch.
   The agency quoted him as saying the release included prisoners
who plotted to assassinate Gadhafi in the past.
   The Libyan leader said, however, that the amnesty does not cover
those ``accused of treason by linking themselves with foreign
powers that have tried to use force to arrive at things of their
own,'' according to JANA, which said he put the number of those
prisoners at 100 or fewer.
   Gadhafi's regime has been described as merciless toward
opponents. Libyan dissidents have been assassinated abroad and
Libyan state television has sometimes broadcast executions of
people convicted on treason charges.
   Amnesty International, the human rights organization, said last
September it received no reply to its appeals for 75 political
prisoners it said were being held in Libya.
   The United States bombed Libya on April 15, 1986 after accusing
the Gadhafi government of supporting terrorism.

<HEAD>Group Arrested for Fighting Birth Control</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a crackdown on violators of China's one-child
policy, authorities in southwestern China arrested people running
an illegal operation to remove women's intrauterine devices, a
state-run newspaper said Thursday.
   The Peasants Daily said the group made huge profits by enticing
women to remove their IUDs with appeals to the traditional belief
that ``more sons equal more happiness.''
   The brief report said the group was headed by Xu Guanghui and Ma
Heyuecai, but gave few details and did not say how many people were
involved.
   It said people in the group removed IUDs from 644 women in Butuo
county in Sichuan province, using unsterilized bamboo and iron
hooks. Many women became infected and several died, the paper said.
   The IUD is the main form of birth control in China's countryside.
   The belief in the importance of having a son has enjoyed a
resurgence in the countryside following the breakup of communes and
return to family farming. More children mean more hands to help at
planting and harvest time.
   The population growth rate has jumped from 1.1 percent in 1985
to 1.4 percent in both 1986 and 1987. China's population of 1.07
billion increased by 15 million in 1987, or nearly 1.5 million over
target, according to official statistics.
   China wants to limit the population to 1.2 billion by the year
2000.
   The government punishes violators of the one-child limit by
imposing fines, but as peasants have become more prosperous, the
fines have become less of a deterrent.
   Authorities plan to tighten enforcement of the one-child limit
by basing evaluations of officials' job performance in part on
their conduct of family planning work. They also called for
increased family planning education.

<HEAD>US Embassy Denies Party Newspaper Report on Mexican Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy in East Berlin has posted a
denial on its outside wall of a report in the Communist Party
newspaper that the U.S.-Mexican border resembles a battle zone.
   It also said people try to get into the United States, not out
of it, as in the case of East Germany.
   Embassy officials posted the printed denial Monday in a
glassed-covered case attached to the wall of the embassy about 300
yards from the Brandenburg Gate in East Berlin, where East Germans
can walk up and read it.
   The statement disputes a report in the party newspaper Neues
Deutschland that calls the U.S.-Mexican border a ``fighting zone.''
   Neues Deutschland said there is often shooting in the area, with
an ``average of 3,000 arrests per day,'' and U.S. border troops
guarding it were trained to ``shoot instinctively.''
   In its denial, the embassy says the border is a ``showplace and
symbol of a complex social and economic situation'' and ``every
U.S. citizen is free to leave the United States when they want to.''
   Apparently in reference to restricted zones along the Berlin
Wall and the heavily fortified East German border with West
Germany, the embassy statement says the border between the United
States and Mexico has no fortifications.
   ``It has never had mine fields, automatic shooting devices,
shoot-to-kill orders, moats or barriers of steel and cement, to
hinder vehicles from crossing,'' the statement says, and in
contrast to the situation in East Germany, ``people attempt to
enter our country.''
   In addition to the Berlin Wall and armed guards, East Germany
has steel-mesh fences and walls along its nearly 870-mile border
with West Germany to prevent escapes to the West.
   The East Germans for years also had mine fields and automatic
shooting devices along the border, but began dismantling them
several years ago.
   According to West German figures, 188 East Germans have died
trying to escape across the the border since the Berlin Wall was
built in August 1961.

<TEXT>
   A principal who banished a high
school senior from homeroom for humming and singing along to the
national anthem when it is played over the intercom says the
dispute is a question of ``who's in charge.''
   Sara Sprague, a 17-year-old member of the choir at North
Kingstown High School, said that her humming and singing were a
``spontaneous reaction to the music'' and that she was within her
rights.
   Principal Paul Rennick said Sara was ``playing games'' by
violating school policy requiring silence when the anthem is played.
   Katherine Janis, her homeroom teacher, said the humming was part
of ``noisy and disruptive'' behavior by Miss Sprague, who has been
banished for the past three weeks.
   The controversy began last month when she began humming to the
anthem and was reprimanded by Janis. The next day, Miss Sprague
sang along _ quietly, she said _ and found herself in the assistant
principal's office.
   The issue went public when Sara wrote a letter to a local
newspaper in protest.
   ``This is a pretty patriotic school. The flag is everywhere.
George Washington is on the walls,'' the principal said. ``It's not
a question of patriotism, it's a question of who's in charge.''
   Miss Sprague's mother, Jane Sprague, said she is backing her
daughter.
   ``It's hard for me to believe that a school supported by local,
state and federal taxes won't let students sing the national anthem
if they want to,'' she said.

   John Lane, a sergeant for the Los Angeles Police Department, was
mayor Thursday after becoming the third person to accept the job
Wednesday night.
   At 8:08 p.m. Wednesday, Mayor John Galloway resigned in an
apparent effort to stave off a reorganization that would have put
Lane in the mayor's chair.
   Mayor Pro Tem Eloise Brown took over. She served for 22 minutes
before she was replaced. At 8:30 p.m., the council voted Lane into
the mayor's chair.
   Ms. Brown was partially to blame for her brief 22-minute reign.
She voted against herself in the 4-1 vote ``because I am a good

   Dancing clay raisins, party animal Spuds
MacKenzie and a piano-playing moonman edged out human actors in a
list of popular TV advertising campaigns. It seems the humans cost
too much and are too risky.
   ``We seem to be heading into a period when we see more created
celebrities, not necessarily human beings, in commercials,'' said
David Vadehra, president of Video Storyboard Tests Inc.
   The New York-based consumer research firm based its 10th annual
survey on interviews with more than 25,000 people about what
commercials they liked best last year.
   Leading the list was the campaign for California raisins, which
used clay models of raisins dancing to the song ``Heard It Through
The Grapevine.''
   Second was Bud Light beer commercials, many of which featured
the English bull terrier Spuds MacKenzie. Other Bud Light
commercials offered variations of what can go wrong if you simply
order a ``light'' without specifying the brand.
   The ad campaign for Pepsi soft drinks placed third, and Miller
Lite beer commercials were fourth.
   Ads for McDonald's restaurants came in fifth. The campaign
included some commercials that featured a piano-playing character
shaped like a moon crescent who extolled dinner at McDonald's to
the tune ``Mack The Knife.''

   More than 5,000 striking high school
teachers and students marched through the city center Thursday
demanding increased government spending on education.
   ``No to austerity, spend more money on education!,'' the
teachers chanted outside the Education Ministry. There are 25,000
high school teachers in Athens.
   The public high school teachers, who make an average of $416 a
month, want a 30 percent raise, improved health benefits and
increased spending on education.
   The students demand a one-year reduction in the four-year
vocational high school curriculum, fewer admission requirements for
technical colleges and guaranteed jobs after graduation.
   They chanted ``We want work, bread, education!'' as they marched
behind the teachers.
   Both students and teachers want Premier Andreas Papandreou's
government to allocate 15 percent of the state budget to education.
   For 1988, the education budget totals 9.8 percent of overall
government spending.

<HEAD>Cosmonaut Recalls Record Space Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veteran cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko appeared at a
news conference on Thursday to show the world he was in fine fettle
after his record 326-day space voyage.
   The red-cheeked, 43-year-old Romanenko said he had just come
back from a vacation in Kislovodsk, where he had been doing
push-ups and other exercises to readjust his body to gravity after
11 months of weightlessness.
   Romanenko, who returned to Earth on Dec. 29, said there were
Italian news reports that he suffered ill health effects from the
flight, and he wanted to disprove them.
   ``I feel fine,'' he declared.
   A Soviet space medical specialist and other space officials at
the news conference agreed that Romanenko, the mission commander,
was in good shape.
   Romanenko also assured reporters that a fellow spaceman was in
no serious danger when pressure in his spacesuit suddenly dropped
during a 3-hour, 40-minute spacewalk on April 12, 1987.
   Cosmonaut Alexander Laveikin and Romanenko had embarked on the
spacewalk to learn why their orbital space station Mir was not able
to dock properly with a laboratory module called Kvant.
   Romanenko said a lever switched in the incorrect position caused
a loss of air pressure in Laveikin's spacesuit. Asked if the
depressurization was life-threatening, he responded, ``There was
nothing particularly scary about it.''
   He said normally the suit should be kept at 0.45 atmospheric
units but the level dropped to 0.35 because a lever that controls
pressure was set incorrectly.
   Romanenko said the cosmonaut contacted mission controllers in
the Soviet Union, who transmitted a command to regulate the
pressure and ``within moments the pressure was back to normal, that
is 0.45.''
   On the spacewalk, Laveikin and Romanenko found what was
preventing Mir from docking with the Kvant module: an ``alien
object'' had gotten into the docking unit. Romanenko said Thursday
the object was a cloth bag containing ``hygenic devices.''
   The cosmonauts removed the bag and mission controllers sent a
signal that successfully docked Mir and Kvant. Soviet scientists
had tried for a week to rescue the 11-ton Kvant, which is used to
conduct a variety of experiments, including those in biotechnology
and astrophysics.

   An explosion tore through a dynamite
factory Thursday and killed five people, officials reported. Eight
people were injured.
   The victims in the blast in Ablon, a Normandy town near the
English Channel, were Rene Rubier, 53, director of the Nobel P.R.B
Explosifs factory; his deputy, Marcel Delhom, 58; factory
superintendent Philippe Gentil, 38, and two workers.
   It was the third explosion at the factory in three years. In
March 1985, three people were killed. In March 1987, an explosion
forced the plant to close until Dec. 10 while new safety measures
were implemented.
   The factory employs 135 people and produces about 20 tons of
explosives a day for civilian use.
   Jean Amet, chief administrator of the Calvados region, said the
explosion occurred in a machine that packs the dynamite into
blocks. He said the injured were in satisfactory condition.
   ``I saw a large flame which rose over the buildings, then,
almost immediately, I heard a loud noise and the flash
disappeared,'' said Claude Hubert, an ambulance driver who was
about a half-mile away.
   The blast occurred shortly after the factory opened at 9 a.m.

   Poland, East Germany and Czechoslovakia
ended an unprecedented ``ecological summit'' Thursday by pledging
to combat pollution that may threaten half of the region's
woodlands.
   The three-day meeting in the western city of Jelenia Gora
reflected the neighboring countries' concern about increased
pollution, particularly in border regions. It was their first
high-level meeting devoted to the environment.
   More than 148,000 acres of forests in western Poland are
threatened with destruction caused by air pollution, officials say.
   Deputy premiers from the three countries agreed ``to expand and
deepen cooperation'' in environmental protection, the official
Polish news agency PAP reported.
   They also decided to meet next year in Czechoslovakia and draw
up an environmental protection agreement, PAP said.
   Deputy Premier Jozef Koziol of Poland was quoted as saying the
three countries have ``acknowledged the existing degradation and
have undertaken to take swift joint effective measures in order to
halt and then reduce environmental contamination.''
   The PAP report did not describe the measures.
   A Polish television news report said the agreement provides for
joint research on pollution-control technology and joint production
of such equipment.
   East Germany's delegation was led by Hans Reichelt and
Czechoslovakia's delegation by Jaromir Obzina.
   Participants in an independent ecological seminar organized by
the opposition Freedom and Peace Movement, a banned Polish peace
and ecology group, wrote an open letter to the officials, saying 30
percent to 50 percent of the forests in the region would die by
1995 if pollution levels do not change.
   The letter, drawn up at the Feb. 26-28 seminar in the
southwestern city of Gliwice, demanded that the public in the three
countries be kept informed about environmental agreements and their
progress.
   The letter said ``nothing or almost nothing is done to ensure''
the implementation of documents drawn up at meetings of Soviet bloc
countries.
   The ecology activists said the concentration of sulphuric oxides
in the area is among the highest in Europe and demanded that the
three countries install equipment to control pollution at six
coal-burning power plants in the region.
   Poland has demanded Czechoslovakia pay cleanup costs for several
major oil spills in the Oder river.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court refused Thursday to
legalize a local union of Solidarity steel workers, but members
said they would continue their activities despite police harassment
and threats of dismissal.
   In another development, a prison official said the outlawed
labor federation's leader for the southern Silesia industrial area
has been on hunger strike since Feb. 5 at a Katowice prison. Jan
Andrzej Gorny is protesting what he describes as his ``unjust
conviction.''
   Gorny is serving 1{ years on conviction of not paying alimony
and using false identity cards. Jerzy Rybarczyk, a spokesman for
the Central Board of Penitentiaries, said Gorny has been force-fed
since Feb. 9.
   Opposition activists said Gorny also was protesting denial of
visits from his family, but Rybarczyk said that issue was resolved.
   At the Supreme Court hearing, Chief Justice Jan Wasilewski
upheld a lower court that ruled in December against registering the
Solidarity local at the steel plant in Stalowa Wola, southeastern
Poland.
   Wasilewski said Polish law prohibits more than one trade union
at a plant.
   Dozens of Solidarity factory committees filed in the past year
for legal recognition under a 1982 law that was supposed to provide
for union pluralism. The Supreme Court has rejected all such
appeals presented to it.
   ``We are going to continue ... our activities and widen them,''
said Wieslaw Wojtas, 31, who heads the Solidarity local's 33-member
organizing committee.
   He predicted management will treat the local's members ``more
harshly'' now, but said they would resist any attempts to dismiss
Solidarity activists.
   ``We have considered the possibility of declaring a strike but
we will use it only as a last resort,'' he said in an interview
after the hearing. ``We have many other means before that.''
   Solidarity members at the Stalowa Wola plant have been watched,
transferred to other jobs and summoned for talks with management,
security police and local authorities, Wojtas said.
   Wladyslaw Liwak, lawyer for the local, argued at the court
hearing that prohibiting union pluralism violates international
labor and human rights agreements signed by Poland and hinders
efforts for economic reform.
   Solidarity, the first free trade union movement in the Soviet
bloc, was outlawed following a martial law crackdown in Poland in
December 1981.

   Legislators rewriting Brazil's
Constitution have voted to cut the minimum voting age from 18 to 16.
   Legislators doubling as a constituent assembly voted 355 to 98
late Wednesday in favor of reducing the minimum voting age. The
proposal would be included in a final draft of the new
constitution, which is expected to be considered by the two houses
of Congress later this year.
   If approved, the constitutional article would permit 5.7 million
more voters, increasing the electorate to nearly 78 million of the
nation's 141 million people.
   Voting would not be mandatory for teens under 18 under the
proposal, while remaining mandatory for those between the ages of
18 and 70.
   Teen-agers interviewed by local newspapers about their new civic
responsibilities had mixed reactions.
   Leandro Martins, 16, told the Jornal Do Brasil newspaper his
generation was not ``responsible enough'' to choose elected
officials, while 17-year-old David Oliveira was quoted as saying
``at last we can have some say in what goes on.''
   The 559 legislators have been meeting since February 1987 to
replace the authoritarian charter handed down by the military
regime that ruled from 1964 to 1985.
   They also are deciding when Brazilians will vote for president
and the country's future system of government.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Motors Corp. bowed to employee pressure
and said Thursday it won't sell its Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary.
However, it said it will close or sell within 18 months four plants
employing about 2,000 people.
   The United Auto Workers said it was pleased by the Acustar
decision but urged Chrysler to find ways not to close the four
plants: Amplex Van Wert in Van Wert, Ohio, Trenton Chemical in
suburban Detroit, Detroit Forge and Detroit Trim.
   The proposed sale of Acustar, which employs about 28,000 in the
United States, Mexico and Canada and had $3 billion in sales in
1987, had been vehemently opposed by UAW members who threatened
plant-by-plant strikes.
   Workers at Chrysler plants throughout the company also had
stopped attending management-union meetings and participating in
other joint activities, and 1,000 picketed Chrysler's Highland Park
headquarters.
   ``We looked at all the offers, took into account the feelings of
our employees and decided not to sell,'' said John Guiniven, a
spokesman for the No. 3 automaker.
   Chrysler had said it was considering selling the subsidiary
because it didn't want to invest in the research needed to upgrade
some operations. Chrysler already buys about 70 percent of its
parts from outside sources.
   The four plants in jeopardy make trim for automobiles, chemicals
used in auto paints and other parts. ``We are going to sell all
four and if not, they will be closed,'' Guiniven said.

   Hundreds of beekeepers dumped their
beehives outside Parliament on Thursday to protest imports of
artificially sweetened foreign honey.
   Earlier the beekeepers, some wearing white coveralls and black
net face masks, marched through the city center shouting ``No more
foreign honey!''
   There are 20,000 beekeepers in Greece, which produces more than
12,000 tons of honey. Greece is the only member of the European
Community with a honey surplus and exports about 1,200 tons yearly,
the Agriculture Ministry says.
   ``Our goal is to stop the import of adulterated foreign honey
which is being sold here as an European Community product,'' said
Nicolaos Papadopoulos, president of the Attica Beekeepers'
Cooperatives.
   Other beekeepers claimed the imported honey was diluted with
glucose to make it taste sweeter.
   Greek-produced honey is thick and fudge-like, with a distinctive
taste derived from the nectar collected by bees from thyme and
other mountain herbs.

<HEAD>First Black Woman Justice Sworn in on Pennsylvania's Highest Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Juanita Kidd Stout was sworn in Thursday as
a justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, becoming the first
black woman in the nation to sit on a state's highest court.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey appointed the former Philadelphia Common
Pleas Court judge to serve out the term of William D. Hutchinson,
who left for the federal bench.
   A justice will be elected to fill the seat in November. Stout,
who reaches the mandatory retirement age of 70 next year, is not
running.
   Stout, who served on the city's Common Pleas Court since 1959,
borrowed from the 4-H Club motto in her remarks after taking the
oath of office.
   ``I promise you that during my tenure on the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania, however short it may be, I shall strive to make the
best better,'' she said.
   The former English teacher has a reputation for correcting
lawyers in court when they misspeak and for editing the opinions of
colleagues.
   ``The trouble is, when Judge Stout sent me a note like that it
was a correction. When Justice Stout sends me a note now, it will
be a reversal,'' said Common Pleas President Judge Edward J.
Bradley, drawing laughter from the crowd in the Supreme Court
chambers.

<HEAD>Argentina Plans Defensive Alert During British Exercises In
Falklands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM H. HEATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina said Thursday it plans
a ``defensive alert'' during scheduled British military exercises
in the Falkland Islands and if necessary ``will execute
corresponding defense plans.''
   The foreign and defense ministries denounced the exercises, due
to begin Monday and end March 31, as ``violating ... (Argentina's )
sovereign rights'' over the islands, which this nation claims were
stolen by the British in 1833.
   Argentina has said the exercises will chill efforts to restore
relations, broken in 1982 when the two countries fought a bloody,
74-day war over the remote South Atlantic islands.
   A joint comminque by the two ministries said the exercises
contradict U.N. resolutions declaring the region a zone of peace.
British officials have said the exercises are essentially defensive.
   The statement said that although Argentina ``repeatedly has
expressed willingness to resolve the dispute in peaceful and
negotiated form'' the government is obliged to ``protect the lives
and property of those who inhabit Argentine soil'' and has adopted
a defensive alert.
   The British exercises will be strictly watched, the ministries
said.
   ``In the event it is necessary, corresponding defense plans''
will be executed, the communique said.
   The ministries did not go into specifics.
   But the statement warned foreign shipping that vessels will be
subject to ``visit, inspection or capture under terms of
international law'' by Argentine authorities ``with the objective
of avoiding their involvement in incidents.''
   The maneuvers were reported to include planned use of Phantom
fighter jets and hundreds of British troops.
   On April 2, 1982, Argentine troops captured the islands, but
Britain sent a task force and defeated the Argentines. In the
fighting, 712 Argentines and 256 British were killed.
   Brig. Gen. Ernesto Crespo, air force chief of staff, said
Thursday that his branch will remain alert to any orders it may
receive from the government regarding the British maneuvers.
   ``You must consider that this is not a simple exercise in the
Malvinas (Falkland) Islands,'' Crespo said. ``It is much more
important and involves peace in the South Atlantic and, as a
result, not only our country but other American states as well.''

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS NIMITZ (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Prince Andrew waved to
his wife, Sarah, as he streaked overhead in a jet catapulted from
the deck of the aircraft carrier Nimitz on Thursday during a tour
off the California coast.
   The airshow was a highlight of the day at sea for the Duke and
Duchess of York, both pilots, who also inspected one of the
catapults and the massive chains that hold the ship's two
60,000-pound anchors.
   ``This is one of the loneliest walks I've ever done,'' the
prince said moments before he boarded the S-3A Viking
anti-submarine warfare jet while Sarah remained on deck.
   As the engines screamed, an apprehensive duchess, wearing a
flight helmet, clutched a gift teddy bear and watched the jet
hurled off the bow.
   The jet wheeled back for a low fly-by and husband and wife waved
to each other before the pregnant duchess boarded a helicopter for
a flight to Long Beach, where the royal yacht Britannia is docked.
   The couple _ the duchess sporting a USS Nimitz baseball cap _
had arrived aboard a Navy helicopter. It landed on the carrier 60
miles west of Los Angeles as a loudspeaker announced: ``Duke of
York arriving.''
   The duke, a helicopter pilot in the Royal Navy who saw action in
Britain's Falkland Islands war with Argentina, saluted Vice Admiral
John H. Fetterman Jr., commander of Naval Air Forces in the Pacific.
   Trailing Andrew was the duchess, in a blue dress and white coat
with navy blue trim.
   The couple were presented leather flight jackets bearing the
inscriptions ``Duke of York'' and ``Duchess of York,'' then sat
down to watch an air show from the main deck of the nuclear-powered
aircraft carrier.
   Dramatic moisture blasts, an aircraft-enveloping fog caused as a
jet breaks the sound barrier, brought a wide-eyed reaction from the
duchess.
   Helicopters demonstrated anti-submarine warfare techniques and
supersonic jets made frequent fly-bys.
   Jet after jet touched down on the deck at 160 mph, catching one
of four cable arresters on the carrier's stern and stretching them
150 yards before coming to a halt. The planes then folded their
wings and taxied to catapults.
   Fetterman narrated for the duchess while the duke engaged in
spirited conversation with the ship's skipper, Capt. Brent Bennitt.
   All then went below for lunch. The menu included cream of
asparagus soup, marinated mushrooms, Melba toast with grilled
Parmesan cheese, chicken salad on a tomato wedge, cherries jubilee,
mineral water and iced tea.
   ``Spam? No Spam,'' Lt. Tim O'Leary, the ship's spokesman, said
in response to reporters' queries.
   The couple, touring Southern California to promote British
trade, started the day with a visit hosted by the International
Foundation for Learning Disabilities at Park Century School in Los
Angeles.
   British actress Joan Collins, a supporter of the charity, was on
hand for the visit.
   The duke and duchess arrived in Los Angeles last Friday and
depart Sunday.

   Bandits ambushed an armored van on a
superhighway Thursday, put a hand grenade on the hood to force
guards out of the vehicle and stole $1.3 million in cash and bonds,
the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   The van, carrying money from Milan to two banks in Sondrio in
northern Italy, was held up in the Seregno area just outside Milan
by gunmen riding in four cars.
   A policeman in Serengo contacted by telephone Thursday said he
had no details. ANSA gave this account:
   A gunman in one car shot out the van's tires. Another car rammed
the van from behind and a third cut it off from the front. The
fourth car parked on the shoulder of the highway headed in the
other direction.
   Four men with pistols and rifles got out. When the driver and
two guards stayed locked inside the van, the gunmen placed a
grenade on the hood.
   Fearing they would be blown up, the three got out. The driver
was hit over the head with a pistol butt. The two others were
forced to open the safe.
   The robbers grabbed the bags, jumped into the car parked on the
other side of the highway and sped off toward Milan.
   A police explosives' expert later detonated the grenade in a
nearby field.

<HEAD>First Egg Laid by Rare California Condors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California condor Thursday laid the first egg
ever produced in captivity by a pair of the endangered birds,
boosting efforts to save the species, the San Diego Wild Animal
Park said.
   If the egg hatches at the end of its two-month incubation, it
will be the first California condor ever conceived in captivity,
officials said. Only 27 of the birds exist, all in captivity, said
park spokesman Tom Hanscom.
   Biologists moved the egg from the nest to an incubator,
according to plan, Hanscom said. The egg may not produce an
offspring because the female is old and her mate, a young male, may
be sexually immature, park officials cautioned.
   By taking the egg from its parents at an early point, scientists
hope to induce the pair to ``double-clutch,'' or produce a second
egg to replace the lost one.
   California condors have been decimated in the wild by lead
poisoning, caused by eating lead shot in animal carcasses,
biologists said.
   The last California condor in the wild was captured and brought
to the Wild Animal Park on April 3, 1987 in a last bid to restore
the vanishing species.
   Fourteen of the birds are kept at the San Diego park in
enclosures not on view to the public. The 13 others are similarly
housed at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   Since 1981, scientists have hatched 13 condors in captivity from
eggs taken in the wild. The birds, which have a wingspan of about 9
feet, are dark reddish-brown with a curved beak.

<HEAD>New Social and Liberal Democrats Party Launched</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The centrist Social Democrats and Liberals
officially united Thursday after eight months of stormy infighting
over the policies of the merged party.
   The new Social and Liberal Democrats Party hopes to end the
dominance of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's governing
Conservatives and the main opposition, the socialist Labor Party.
   The Social Democrats voted nearly 2-1 and the Liberals more than
7-1 to merge in mail ballots after separate party conventions
approved the merger last month. But only slightly more than half
the party members voted.
   Liberal leader David Steel, who is expected to be elected leader
of the new party, told a news conference it will give ``hope to a
whole new generation.''
   Steel pledged to press for rejuvenation of the ailing National
Health Service and run-down inner city neighborhoods.
   The Social Democrats' leader, Robert Maclennan, said Britain
``needs a great national party, with roots in all our communities.''
   Maclennan called the Conservatives ``complacent, centralizing,
autocratic'' and the Labor Party ``the complacent, inert,
bureaucratic alternative.''
   David Owen, who resigned as Social Democrat leader in opposition
to the union, urged members to boycott the vote and called it ``a
fiasco.'' He plans to continue the Social Democrats as a separate
party.
   The two parties placed a distant third in last June's general
election, in which Mrs. Thatcher won a third term as prime minister.

   A 12-year-old who earned $500 by going a
year without television missed the first show she planned to watch
Thursday night. She was doing homework.
   ``I watched the last half of `Cheers' because my homework ran
into it,'' Jenny Machalleck said. ``I had planned to watch `Cosby'
but I was doing homework through that.''
   Earlier Thursday, she received the $500 check promised by her
parents if she could go for a full year without television. The
deal they made on March 2, 1987, was to cure what she called a
six-hour-a-day TV habit.
   Thursday's experience _ missing TV while finishing school work _
was quite a change, said Jenny, a seventh-grader. ``Before, I would
never worry about my homework. I would just watch TV,'' she said.
   As for her first sampling of TV in a year, she said, ``It was
fun to watch because I hadn't watched in so long. But I found I
hadn't really been missing anything.''
   ``I was just not as enthusiastic as I thought I would be,'' she
said.

   About 200 leftist rebels raided a
northern mountain village, set fire to a police detachment and
kidnapped a policeman, the military said Friday.
   A report at the Philippine Constabulary headquarters in the
capital said the attack by the communist New People's Army rebels
occurred Thursday in Sadanga, about 180 miles north of Manila.
   It said police manning the outpost put up a brief fight but
surrendered after two defenders were wounded. The report said the
rebels confiscated police firearms, burned down the outpost and
took a patrolman, Helbert Pacho, as a hostage before fleeing to the
forest.
   A separate group of rebels ambushed reinforcements from a nearby
police station, but the report did not say whether casualties
resulted.
   The communists have been fighting to overthrow the government
for 19 years.

   He was chairman of Carter's successful gubernatorial bid in 1970
and headed the Committee for Jimmy Carter, Carter's national
campaign organization, when Carter was elected president in 1976.
   Carter, as governor, appointed Alston to the Board of Regents,
and as president appointed him ambassador.
   Alston, a Navy veteran of World War II, raised millions of

<HEAD>Dukakis, Gephardt Exchange Attacks; Dole, Gore Boast Endorsements</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with Robertson TV speech, Washington Post poll in
grafs 5-6</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats Michael Dukakis and Richard Gephardt stepped up their
attacks on each other for taking money from special interests
Thursday, with Gephardt raising ``the specter of a serious conflict
of interest.'' Republican Bob Dole and Democrat Albert Gore Jr.
touted new endorsements.
   Dole won backing from a favorite of the Republican right, former
U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Gore got support from
Charles Robb, the former governor of Virginia, and Gov.-elect Buddy
Roemer of Louisiana.
   Both parties' presidential hopefuls focused on the big round of
primaries coming up across the South and elsewhere.
   Republican front-runner George Bush and rivals Pat Robertson and
Jack Kemp were all in South Carolina, where Republicans vote
Saturday in what Bush hopes will be a victory that propels him
toward far more delegates in the rest of the South on Super Tuesday.
   A poll in Friday's editions of The Washington Post suggested
Bush holds a decisive lead in the state. In the survey of 1,000
people who say they will vote in Saturday's primary, 49 percent
supported Bush, 26 percent Dole, 14 percent Robertson and 7 percent
Kemp.
   Robertson bought half an hour of air time on television stations
around South Carolina Thursday night to ``set the record straight''
on religion issues. The former television evangelist said he
believes in the separation of church and state, but added: ``I do
not and I will not deny my beliefs or my church.''
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, began airing a television
commercial that mocks Gephardt's claim to be fighting against the
establishment. The ad lists some of the corporate political action
committees and other special interests that have contributed to
Gephardt's campaign.
   The Missouri congressman fired back with an accusation that
Dukakis was bankrolled by ``an all-star cast of Eastern
Establishment money interests'' as well as individuals and
businesses that are regulated by his state government.
   ``I'll gladly give back every penny in PAC contributions if Mike
Dukakis will return the millions he's received from special
interests who do business with the state of Massachusetts,''
Gephardt said. ``These are people who depend on the state
government he runs for their livelihood, and it raises the specter
of a serious conflict of interest.''
   Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach said the campaign has taken no
money from any corporate PACs or registered lobbyists in
Massachusetts.
   Gephardt also found himself under attack from a new Gore
television commercial.
   Gore's ad, aired across the South, is a 60-second clip from
their debate in Dallas two weeks ago, when Gore accused Gephardt of
flip-flops on a list of issues, including President Reagan's
economic proposals. ``Where are you this week on Reaganomics?''
Gore asks Gephardt.
   On the campaign trail, Dukakis defended his opposition to a fee
on imported oil in Texas, the big prize of Super Tuesday primaries
and a state where local sentiment runs in favor of the tax. He said
an oil import fee ``will put a $50 bilion burden on this nation's
economy.''
   He also lashed out at the heart of Gephardt's populist message,
his call for tough retaliatory trade sanctions, dismissing them as
``policies that almost destroyed us 50 years ago.''
   Gephardt was back in his home state after picking up $425,000 at
two fund-raisers there a day before _ money that is critical for
getting his message on television ads in the South.
   In Kansas City, he visited a General Motors automobile assembly
plant that is scheduled to close in April because of poor domestic
auto sales. He pledged a fight to open foreign markets to U.S. cars.
   Among the other Democrats, Jesse Jackson campaigned in the oil
patch, telling the Oklahoma Legislature he hopes to revitalize the
domestic oil industry through an alliance with Canada and Latin
American countries to reduce dependence on OPEC states in the
Middle East.
   Bidding to expand beyond his base of black voters, Jackson won
the endorsement of a vetern white Oklahoma lawmaker and won a
standing ovation from a joint session of the Legislature.
   Gore, whose entire presidential strategy depends on
jump-starting his campaign in the Southern primaries, gained in
Robb one of the Southern endorsements he has most sought.
   Robb, favored to win a GOP-held Senate seat this year in
Virginia, said Gore's foreign policy and defense policy ``more
closely aligns itself with what I think is right for our party and
right for the country.''
   Dole appeared with Kirkpatrick at a Washington news conference,
saying she ``symbolizes the soul of the Reagan revolution.'' His
campaign readied television commercials featuring the endorsement
of Kirkpatrick, a former Democrat and university professor whose
tough talk against communism endeared her to President Reagan.
   Dole also spoke at a White House conference on drug abuse and
urged a federal death penalty for drug ``overlords and kingpins.''
He opposed distributing clean needles to drug addicts, as is being
done in New York to combat the spread of AIDS, saying ``it also
endorses addiction.''
   Bush continued to focus most of his Southern campaign on South
Carolina, and in Rock Hill he invoked a quote from former baseball
player Yogi Berra in stressing his experience.
   ``I won't make the wrong mistakes,'' Bush said.
   Kemp kept up his tough talk on Panama, calling for revoking the
Panama Canal treaty if that country's military strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, indicted on U.S. drug charges, retains
power.
   ``If they want to keep Noriega, we're going to have to keep the
Panama Canal,'' Kemp said.
   Robertson, the GOP wildcard candidate who is also focusing on
South Carolina, traveled by bus along the towns of the Pee Dee
River.
   Robertson's organizational strength helped him score a
two-to-one victory over Bush in Alaska's precinct caucuses the day
before.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Wednesday he
was considering further restrictions on news media access in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying journalists have harmed
Israel.
   Shamir did not say what steps he might take. Under current
regulations, soldiers are authorized to temporarily close parts of
the occupied territories to reporters. The army frequently uses
this measure to keep the news media from the sites of violent
clashes.
   In a sharply worded attack, Shamir accused journalists of being
biased against Israel and suggested such bias was part of official
editorial policy.
   ``There is no lack of people (Israeli officials) who are ready
to explain what is happening,'' Shamir told American Jewish leaders
in Jerusalem.
   ``The trouble is they (reporters) don't want to listen. They are
looking for Arab sources of information. Maybe they even have some
instructions from their establishment.''
   Shamir called on American Jewish leaders to quell within their
ranks any criticism of Israel, saying it was ``non-Jewish to join
an anti-Israeli front of non-Jewish people.''
   Several prominent American Jews, including actor-director Woody
Allen and Rabbi Alexander Schindler, head of Jewish Reform
congregations in the United States, have criticized Israel in past
weeks for its crackdown on Arab protests in the occupied
territories.
   By U.N. count, 76 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds
wounded in unrest in the occupied lands since Dec. 8.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vermont office worker won a prize Wednesday for
a poem judged among the six best of 20,000 entries in a worldwide
competition among English-speaking poets.
   Arthur Stone of Morrisville, Vt., was the only American among
six finalists chosen by Ted Hughes, the British poet laureate, and
Irish poet Seamus Heaney. They selected the six from a list of 600
compiled by six other poets from the entries.
   ``It's a nice thing to happen _ it's rather surreal to be a poet
in America,'' said Stone after receiving a check for 500 pounds
($885) and a fountain pen in the Arvon International Poetry
Competition. The prizes were awarded at Sotheby's auction house in
London.
   ``The quality of the poetry was very high and we wished we could
have given more prizes,'' said Hughes, who spent a week with Heaney
reading the 600 poems in Cambridge, Mass., where Heaney is a
professor at Harvard University.
   ``There were 100 more poems we would have liked to give prizes
to, but we will put them in an anthology with the finalists and the
10 runners-up,'' he said.
   The runners-up, who won 250 pounds ($440), included four
Americans: Brendan Galvin, Mary Karr, Patrick Madden and Pat
Maquire. Their hometowns were not immediately available.
   The top prize of 5,000 pounds ($8,850) went to Selima Hill,
whose poem ``The Notebook'' is the imaginary diary of a patient in
a psychiatric hospital. The other five finalists were not ranked.
   Stone, 43, was born in Long Beach, Calif., grew up in the Mojave
Desert and now works for the Office of Alcohol and Drug Abuse in
Vermont.
   He said in an interview he writes poetry as a pastime, jotting
down ideas on bits of paper and often getting his best ideas just
after waking up or just before going to sleep.
   Asked what his colleagues think of his poetry, Stone said:
``Well, they refer to me as `the poet' rather than the information
and planning specialist, which is my job.''
   Stone has had poems published in American literary magazines and
calls ``Late Arrival,'' the 51-line prize-winning poem, ``a
realistic confessional about my initiation into the world.''
   It starts with his birth and plunges quickly into memories of
his boyhood, with people telling him their experiences and advising
him to learn from them.
   Stone said his poem was triggered by a work of another American
poet, Denis Johnson.
   ``There's a lot of cross-fertilization in the arts and it's
extremely important,'' Stone said. ``I'm active in theater and I
play saxophone in a jazz ensemble. It all helps me with my poetry.''
   Arvon is a foundation which teaches writing. The contest was its
fifth. The organization gets its name from the Arvon seat of poetry
in the ``Mabinogion,'' the book of Welsh medieval tales.

   Police searched homes of
suspected neo-Nazis in 61 West German cities Wednesday,
confiscating Nazi flags and arresting four people, officers said.
   A police official in Stuttgart, where federal authorities
coordinated the searches by state and local police, said the
arrests came during raids on homes of right-wing extremist suspects
in Munich, Duisburg, Grevenbroich and Hanover.
   The official, who spoke on condition of not being further
identified, said that more than 90 homes in all were searched for
evidence of membership in the illegal neo-Nazi group Action Front
of National Socialists-National Activists. The national government
banned the group in December 1983 on the ground it advocated
violence against leftists and foreigners and promoted outlawed Nazi
ideology.
   The searches were apparently carried out in conjunction with the
release from prison of prominent neo-Nazi Michael Kuehnen, a former
West German army lieutenant who headed the outlawed Action Front
organization.
   Kuehnen was freed from Butzbach prison north of Frankfurt on
Wednesday after completing a 3{-year sentence for distributing
banned right-wing extremist propaganda, said Jochen Schroers, a
spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutor's office, in a telephone
interview.

<HEAD>Asylum Bid of Romanian Olympic Coach Reviewed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALGARY, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coach from communist Romania's Olympic
team met with immigration officers at a secret location Wednesday
after appealing for asylum in Canada, an Immigration Department
spokesman said.
   ``He's in a secluded place, a safe place with security,''
spokesman Gerry Maffre said in Ottawa.
   The coach was not identified, but Olympic sources and Canadian
news media said he was Dumitru Focseneanu, the Romanian bobsled
coach whose team had 27th and 30th place finishes at the Winter
Olympic Games in Calgary last week.
   ``We're trying to find out what he really wants to do,'' Maffre
said.
   The bobsled coach reportedly refused to board a bus taking the
22-member Romanian team to Calgary airport Monday night and sought
refugee status.
   The federal Immigration Department was handling the case. The
Soviet Union filed an angry protest over an immigration hotline set
up in Calgary to handle emergencies and possible defection cases.
   The Romanian was the only known defector among more than 1,800
Olympic athletes and 1,000 coaches and officials from 57 countries.
But three Romanian speed skaters and their coach left Calgary
abruptly the day before the Games began amid speculation the
athletes planned to defect.
   City Police Superintendent Len Esler said the defector
approached two police officers at the athletes' village at the
University of Calgary about 9:30 p.m. Monday and ``requested
political asylum.''
   Esler said the man was taken to a police station where
immigration officers picked him up. He refused to give the man's
name ``for his safety and the safety of his family.''
   Focseneanu was in Calgary last December during a bobsled World
Cup competition.
   The Romanian Embassy in Ottawa refused to comment.
   Wilf Lindner, manager of the Calgary immigration center, said
the man would be allowed to stay only after a medical examination,
a security check into his background and an Immigration Department
hearing.
   ``All decisions are made on a case-to-case basis,'' he said.

<HEAD>Cubs Give Commitment To Stay At Wrigley Field</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Cubs on Wednesday promised to stay at
Wrigley Field unless faced with ``circumstances beyond the Cubs'
control.''
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer, who had demanded the commitment from the
club's owners, the Tribune Co., before signing an ordinance
allowing night games at the 72-year-old ballpark for the first time
in Cubs history, said he was satisfied.
   ``I am extremely pleased that the Tribune Co. has responded
positively to my firm commitment of assuring Chicago Cubs fans that
our National League team will stay in Chicago,'' the mayor said.
   Last week, the City Council voted to allow the Cubs to play
eight night games this year and 18 in each of the following years
until 2002. Wrigley is the only major-league ballpark without
lights.
   In a letter to the mayor, the team vowed to stay at Wrigley
Field ``as long as they have the ability to hold games and conduct
business as described in the ordinance, and events or circumstances
beyond the Cubs' control do make this, in their reasonable
judgment, either not practicable or not financially feasible.''
   The letter from John W. Madigan, executive vice president of the
Tribune Co, didn't specify what circumstances could prompt the team
to move.
   But Don Grenesko, Cubs executive vice president for business
operations, said over the weekend that the team wanted an escape
clause if voters banned alcohol at the park.
   Wrigley Field neighbors fearful of unruly fans and traffic
problems night games could bring have threatened to launch a
campaign to vote the precinct dry.

<TEXT>
   The National Assembly opened a special
session Wednesday to try to clear the way for general elections.
Two opposition parties meanwhile squabbled over a plan to merge.
   The one-week special session, the third this year, was called to
adopt new laws governing legislative elections, expected in
mid-April.
   Whether the assembly would be able to adopt new election laws
was not clear, because rival political parties could not agree on
the issue.
   The adoption of new laws is necessary to hold the general
elections.
   Efforts to merge two opposition parties appeared successful last
week but snagged on the role that Kim Dae-jung should play in a new
integrated party to be formed.
   The opposition agreed to join forces to mount a united front in
the coming voting for Parliament following its presidential defeat
last December, .
   Since Kim Young-sam resigned the presidency of the main
opposition Reunfication Democratic Party last month, pressure has
been building on Kim Dae-jung to resign as well as chief of his
Party for Peace and Democracy.
   Kim Dae-jung said he would step aside if the opposition unites,
but he indicated this week he would continue to remain active.
   Fifty-three Reunification legislators Wednesday accused Kim
Dae-jung of reneging on his promise to resign and demanded he take
a back seat in the united opposition party.
   Kim Dae-jung's followers proposed Wednesday that the new party
be led by the two Kims.
   Kim Young-sam objected to the idea, but said he would be
satisfied with being an ordinary party member. He said he wanted to
atone for the opposition defeat last December.
   The two Kims divided 56 percent of the opposition vote in South
Korea's first direct presidential elections in 16 years. That gave
the victory to Roh Tae-woo of the governing Democratic Justice
Party, who received a 36.6 percent plurality.
   Since that defeat, both Kims have been under public pressure to
retire from politics.

<TEXT>
   Some remembrances make for odd, inconclusive
theater.
   Take ``Wenceslas Square,'' which opened Wednesday at the New
York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. It's a fragmented memory
play about an American theater professor who returns to Prague
several years after the 1968 Soviet invasion and discovers what
repression can do to people who have tasted freedom.
   That seems like an unlikely subject for Larry Shue, best known
as the author of ``The Foreigner'' and ``The Nerd,'' two cheerfully
goofy comedies that triumphed in New York despite critical sniffles
from the press.
   Shue, who died in a plane crash in 1985, apparently based the
play on an incident in his own life. The comedy-drama focuses on
the professor and his assistant, a young photographer who has
agreed to shoot pictures for the scholar's book. Shue was the
photographer, and he tells the story in flashback.
   The episodic play seems unfinished, not completely worked out,
as it follows the professor, played by Jonathan Hadary, and his
assistant (Bruce Norris) during their Eastern European adventure.
The duo meet and interview a variety of theater and government
people, all played either by Victor Garber or Dana Ivey.
   Individual scenes in ``Wenceslas Square'' are often effective
and very funny, but transitions are choppy. Maybe that's why
director Jerry Zaks utilizes a turntable set that keeps the play on
a dizzy merry-go-round course.
   Shue tries to show the accommodation the Czechs made to
restrictions on their personal and artistic lives. It's something
the professor and his assistant gradually perceive, but the evening
never builds to a dramatic pay-off. One wonders what the play would
have been like if Shue had been able to do some rewriting.
   Still there are some wonderful, gentle comic moments, many of
them provided by an impeccable cast. Garber has a delightful scene
as a befuddled Czech trying to decipher the vagaries of the English
language, while Ivey is appealing as the man's sympathetic,
ever-helpful wife.
   The play doesn't so much end as just stop when the professor and
his assistant complete their two-week stay. You really don't know
much more about them after their visit than before. At least Shue
has made the trip a modestly amusing journey.

<HEAD>Japan To Increase Support For U.S. Base Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan and the United States agreed Wednesday that
the Tokyo government will pay a larger share of the costs of
running U.S. military bases in Japan.
   Under the new agreement, signed by Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno
and the acting U.S. Embassy charge d'affaires, L. Desaix Anderson,
Japan will pay all benefits and allowances for the 21,000 Japanese
base workers, including transportation, housing and retirement
expenses.
   The United States pays the salaries of the Japanese workers.
   The pact will replace a year-old accord and boost Japan's share
of allowances for Japanese base workers from a maximum 50 percent
to 100 percent by 1991, the U.S. Embassy said in a statement.
   Japan's financial contribution will account for about 40 percent
of the annual cost of maintaining U.S. bases in Japan once the
protocol is fully implemented, the statement said.
   Tokyo and Washington signed an initial accord in January 1987,
requiring Japan to cover up to half the expenditures for Japanese
workers at U.S. bases. Wednesday's agreement amends that pact.
   In fiscal 1987, Japan set aside $128 million to offset costs for
Japanese employees at the bases. With the yen's rise of about 100
percent against the dollar over the past three years, however, the
cost to the United States of maintaining the Japanese base workers
has skyrocketed.
   The new agreement follows a pledge by Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita during a visit to Washington in January to increase
Japan's contribution toward maintaining U.S. forces in Japan.

   Millionaire philanthropist Armand Hammer said he
will spearhead a campaign to raise $1 billion a year to wipe out
cancer by the year 2000.
   The extra capital ``would provide the resources we need to cure
cancer in the next 10 years,'' Hammer said in a telephone interview
from Los Angeles on Wednesday.
   The money will go directly to research at the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md., said Hammer, a non-practicing physician
who turns 90 in May. ``There will be no overhead charges,'' he said.
   The institute's annual research budget is $1.4 billion.
   Hammer, chairman and chief executive officer of Occidental
Petroleum Corp., already has donated $100,000 for cancer research
and has received commitments from nine other industrialists to do
the same.
   About 475,000 people died last year from cancer. The death rate
from most major forms of the disease has improved little over the
past 15 years.
   However, the director of the National Cancer Institute, Dr.
Vincent DeVita, expressed guarded optimism on whether the extra
dollars would lead to a cure. At the very least, it would ``make a
dent,'' DeVita said.
   With the help of a mass media campaign, the drive will seek to
raise $500 million in private contributions, which Hammer hopes
will be matched in federal funds. Some congressmen already have
agreed to support the effort, he said.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Announces Amnesty; Reaches Out to United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi said Wednesday he
was releasing all Libyan prisoners except those accused of plotting
with foreign countries, the official Libyan news agency JANA
reported.
   JANA also said that Gadhafi announced he would reach out to the
United States once it changed its policies toward his country.
   Both statements came in a speech to the General People's
Congress, the North African country's highest policy-making body,
according to JANA dispatches monitored in Rome.
   Gadhafi said about 400 prisoners would be freed from the Tripoli
prison on Thursday and the prison would be torn down, JANA said.
   Among those being freed are prisoners who plotted to assassinate
Gadhafi before and after he seized power in 1969, he was quoted as
saying.
   ``I forgive them regardless of the sentences passed against
them,'' the colonel was quoted as saying.
   The amnesty does not cover those ``accused of treason by linking
themselves with foreign powers that have tried to use force to
arrive at things of their own,'' JANA quoted Gadhafi as saying.
There are less than 100 such prisoners, he said.
   It was not clear where these remaining prisoners would be kept
if the Tripoli prison is demolished.
   According to JANA, Gadhafi also announced abolishment of
``extraordinary trials'' and said all cases will be referred to a
``people's court'' run by the People's Congress.
   Gadhafi's regime gained a reputation over the years as being
ruthless toward political opponents. Numerous Libyan dissidents
were assassinated abroad and his regime periodically televised
public executions for alleged treason.
   Last Septemer, the human rights organization Amnesty
International said it received reports of Libyan prisoners being
beaten on the soles of their feet or hung upside down from a perch
and beaten. It said it received no reply to its appeals for 75
political prisoners it says are being held in Libya.
   On relations with the United States, Gadhafi was quoted as
saying the ``animosity will remain'' until the United States
``recognizes our right to live, respects us over our own land and
asks for cooperation with us as equal. And then we shall stretch
our hands to it.''
   He said the United States denies rights to Libyans because it
recogniezes only a 12-mile territorial limit in the U-shaped Gulf
of Sidra. Libya claims the entire gulf.
   U.S. and Libyan forces clashed in the gulf in March 1986, and a
month later U.S. jets bombed Libya in retaliation for Libya's
alleged involvement in international terrorism.

   The AIDS virus infects the lining of the cervix,
which may help explain how the deadly disease spreads during sex
and childbirth, according to a study released today.
   The research suggests, though doesn't prove, that the woman's
cervix might be infected directly during intercourse through
contact with virus-laden sperm. Experts knew that infected women
may have the AIDS virus in their genital sections, but it was
unclear where this virus came from.
   It appears that the cervix could be an initial site of infection
during intercourse and a source of virus that later infects sexual
partners and infants during birth.

glossing over a dispute that had threatened to mar solidarity at

   Summing up two days of talks by leaders of the 16-member

excellent. We're strong, we're united, we're prosperous and we're

judge earlier this week declared random drug tests of civilian Army
employees as unconstitutional.
   But Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said drug testing _
especially random testing _ ``is absolutely critical'' in the
aviation industry to make certain travelers are not endangered by a
flight crew member, mechanic or other employee in a
safety-sensitive job being impaired by drugs.

   Lie detectors, likened by one lawmaker to
``20th century witchcraft,'' would be largely banned from use in
job interviews and the private workplace under legislation approved
by the Senate on Thursday.
   On a 69-27 vote, the Senate approved a bill co-written by Sens.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah _ normally
adversaries on labor-management issues _ outlawing about 85 percent
of the current use of polygraph examinations.
   Conservative opponents predicted that President Reagan would
sign the legislation once a final version of the bill has emerged
from a Senate-House conference.

   Sales were unexpectedly slow in February, the nation's largest
general retailers reported Thursday, prompting worries that a
year-old bout of sluggishness in the retail sector has yet to run
its course.
   ``The results do not bode well for the economy,'' said Fred
Wintzer, a retail industry analyst for the investment firm Alex.
Brown & Sons Inc. in Baltimore.
   ``It's definitely indicative of a further slowing in the

   President P.W. Botha said
Thursday his party's election losses to the far right were
``temporary disappointments,'' but they will force tough choices
about his cautious reform of racial policy.
   Leaders of the Conservative Party were jubilant about the
decisive victory over the National Party in two parliamentary
by-elections Wednesday. They said it shows increasing numbers of
whites want apartheid strengthened and oppose even a token role for
the black majority in national politics.
   Botha must decide whether to appease those voters or move ahead
with reforms in spite of them. The far right sees his goal of
limited power-sharing as surrender. Most black leaders and white
liberals reject it as inadequate.

   AIDS patients are at vastly increased risk to
commit suicide, not only compared to the general population but
compared to victims of other terminal illnesses, a study has found.
   AIDS victims are doubly exposed to self-destructive impulses,
first when they learn they have the disease, and second when the
disease begins to affect the central nervous system, researchers
said.
   ``The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has been associated
with secondary depression and other psychiatric syndromes ... all
of which are associated with higher suicide rates,'' the
researchers wrote in Friday's issue of the Journal of the American

radiation, the State Department said Thursday.
   ``Microwave signals in the 5-11 GHz (gigahertz) range continue
to be detected at the Moscow embassy chancery,'' the department
said in statement issued by its Bureau of Diplomatic Security.
   The statement marked the department's first status report on the
still-unexplained radiation problem since Nov. 10, 1983, when
then-Ambassador Arthur Hartman told reporters in Moscow that a
microwave beam in operation between July 14 and Oct. 19, 1983 had
been protested to the Soviet Foreign Ministry.

<HEAD>Is Everything Under Control?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In conducting a ``decision-makers poll,'' an
investment house economist asks: ``Overall, is it fair to say that
the Federal budget process is out of control?''
   Fair? While it appears that some experts can't decide on an
answer, that shouldn't deter anyone having a casual acquaintance
with numbers from offering an independent view.
   Consider:
   _The budget has been out of balance for about two decades, and a
president dedicated to budget balance not only hasn't reached that
goal in two terms, but has suffered the worst imbalances of any
president in history.
   _The president now proposes a budget in deficit by $129.5
billion for fiscal 1989, while the Congressional Budget Office
disagrees with that figure to the tune of $46.5 billion more.
   _The failure of Congress and the White House to agree on
deficit-cutting forced creation of a National Economic Commission
to devise some answers by March 1, 1989 _ in effect postponing any
decision until then.
   Well? Is it or isn't it out of control?
   If you agree that it is, you might agree on several other
aspects of government that seem equally in disarray. Taxes, for
example.
   Does the United States have a tax policy?
   If it does, you might experience difficulty in finding it among
all th changes, revisions, amendments, differing opinions,
revocations, increases, decreases, inconsistencies, exceptions and
the like.
   Between 1964 and 1986, Congress enacted 16 major tax bills and
dozens of lesser bills. In 1981, the Economic Recovery Tax Act
promised big corporate tax reductions. By 1986, other acts had
turned it into an increase.
   Such tortured turns provoked the Tax Foundation to comment that
``the history of major tax legislation since 1964 represents a
seesaw of revenue decreases and increases without any apparent
consistency...''
   Perhaps as confusing as any tax event _ and serving to abet the
notion that something is out of control _ is the Tax Reform Act of
1986.
   That act was widely publicized as allegedly cutting, simplifying
and making taxes fairer. Somehow, taxpayers are now finding, a
tax-rate cut can mean higher taxes. Simpler? No, more complex.
Fairer? Debatable.
   A sense of lost control is also impressed on the mind of any
observer of the federal bureaucracy, the cutting of which was a
keystone of the platform on which Ronald Reagan was elected to the
White House.
   You probably recall the promise: Power would be transferred from
the public to the private sector, allowing private enterprise to
grow as government shrank. Government would get off the backs of
people.
   But what happened, in spite of good intentions on the part of
the most powerful political figures in the nation, was very
different. The bureaucracy spread and swallowed some of the private
sector's energy.
   A study just released by The Conference Board, largely business
supported, shows that major companies must devote more _ not less _
attention to federal regulatory and legislative issues since the
Reagan administration took office.
   More than 80 percent of the 300 companies surveyed stated that
both the number and importance of federal issues have climbed since
the beginning of 1981. Nearly half say these issues have increased
greatly.
   ``Sobering and instructive,'' says Seymour Lusterman, who
authored the study.
   Most corporate leaders, he observes, ``have come to believe that
many of the forces behind their regulatory and legislative concerns
are outside the control of any administration.''
   Quite sobering and instructive _ and provocative too. It makes
many people wonder just how and by whom power is exerted, or
whether it is exerted instead by a system out of control.

   Hunters in rural France are mobilizing in support
of their traditonal use of a glue-like substance, cages and nets to
trap birds _ methods banned throughout Western Europe since 1979.
   Hunting groups say the centuries-old practices should be
protected as part of France's national heritage. They maintain that
the impact on bird flocks is trivial.
   ``There is an anger which is in danger of exploding,'' said
Henry Sallenave, president of the regional hunting federation in
the Landes in southwestern France.
   ``These are simple people living in contact with the land and
they don't understand the measures, since less than 1 percent of
the migrating (bird) population is taken.''
   Bird protectionists succeeded in 1979 in getting the European
Economic Community to ban such practices as the ``gluaux'' (gluey,
lime-smeared sticks), ``matoles'' (a cage) and ``pantes'' (a
spring-triggered net) to such birds as thrushes, skylarks, wood
pigeons and swallows.
   France agreed to the EEC directive, but contends that an
exception in the agreement for ``judicious exploitation'' of small
numbers of birds covers these traditional French hunting practices.
   So trapping with gluaux has continued, although only in certain
rural districts of southeastern France.
   French officials argue that the ban should not be allowed to
wipe out a small, but significant part of living French history.
   ``France is acting within the spirit of the EEC directive,
because very few birds are taken,'' said Gerard Tendron, a
technical adviser at the French Environment Ministry.
   But the EEC Commission disagreed and brought France before the
European Court in Luxembourg. A ruling is expected sometime this
spring.
   In similar cases brought against Belgium, West Germany, Italy
and the Netherlands, the European Court decided in favor of the ban.
   Premier Jacques Chirac of France has promised French hunters
that the court rules in favor of the ban this time, he will try to
have the EEC directive changed so that it does not apply to
traditional hunting.
   When the thrushes begin to migrate in early October, hunters
plant tall sticks smeared with bird lime, a kind of natural glue
extracted from the holly bush. When the birds land on the sticks,
their feet stick to them.
   Few of the birds caught this way are killed and eaten. Most are
put into cages and used to attract larger flocks that then are
killed by hunters with shotguns.
   Hunting in this way is still allowable but limited to 30 sticks
per hunter. Bird protectionists contend, however, that it is next
to impossible to police the limitations in rural regions.
   In southwestern France, skylarks are trapped with the matole, a
cage perched on three small sticks that falls on top of a bird.
   Wood pigeons and swallows are trapped in the Landes and the
Pyrennees with pantes, huge nets that operate on a system of
springs to trap the birds inside.
   Whole villages often turn out to shoo birds toward the nets set
up in the fields.
   Hunters claim these methods do no harm. Sallenave described the
birds trapped as ``a natural renewable capital'' and said their
methods have little impact on the bird populations concerned.
   Practitioners of the gluaux method say they take only 75,000
thrushes a year while hunters with guns kill about 13 million
annually. The national hunting federation estimates that 30,000 of
the 1.8 million hunters in France use the old-fashioned systems.
   Antoine Reille of the Bird Protection League said his group
opposes these traditional hunting methods on he grounds that they
are not selective and a hunter may not always be able to recognize
a protected bird and free it as he is required to do so by law.
   He and other protectionists say protected robins and ortolans
often fall prey to the trappers. In the Landes, ortolans are a
prized culinary delicacy, eaten whole.
   The protectionists also say that by the time a hunter frees a
protected bird from the gluaux stick, its feathers are so
impregnated by the gluey substance that they fall out in a few days
and the bird dies of cold.

<HEAD>`Saturday Night Live' Star Branching Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL COLLINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dana Carvey, the Church Lady of ``Saturday Night
Live,'' is taking another stab at the movies. But this time will be
different.
   ``It's the first time I've ever been in a film and gotten to be
funny,'' said Carvey, who co-stars in ``Moving'' with Richard Pryor.
   Carvey plays ``a very upstanding young man'' named Brad Sanders.
Pryor is moving his family from New Jersey to Idaho; Sanders is
hired to drive Pryor's prize Saab Turbo to the new home.
   ``And it's not until later that he finds I'm a world renowned,
10-person schizophrenic,'' Carvey says.
   ``We mostly see three of them. We see him as a straight person.
We see him as a sort of Norman Bates-type character _ kind of
weird. And we seen him in a character like Dennis Hopper in
`Apocalypse Now.' No one can get close to him. Sort of a burned-out
character.''
   Carvey describes the movie as ``a fun, free-flowing comedy.'' He
was allowed to improvise, allowed to flesh out his characters.
   Pryor ``was incredibly generous to me, and just a gentle, sweet
person to work with, just generous. There was none of this, `Get
out of the way, kid.' It was totally, `What do you want to do?' and
`Go ahead.' It was nice.''
   For a long time, Carvey was pegged as the bland nice guy, an
innocent kid. He was in 1985's ``Tough Guys'' as the probation
officer of aged convicts Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. He also
was pigeonholed in a series of TV shows, including Mickey Rooney's
straight man in a short-lived 1981 NBC sitcom, ``One of the Boys.''
   Then, in October 1986, he finally got his chance to do comedy on
television with ``Saturday Night Live,'' introducing audiences to
the Church Lady, burned-out rock singer Derek Stevens, Lord
Christie and a host of other characters, personalities and voices.
   Newsweek magazine credited him with ``almost singlehandedly
rejuvenating'' the show.
   Now in his second season on the show, Carvey is changing his
repertoire. The self-righteous, judgmental Church Lady will only be
doing two or three more appearances this year; Carvey says many of
the weekly guest hosts want to do the skit, but he is concerned
about burning out the character.
   This season his characters have included Hans, who, with Franz
(``SNL'' regular Kevin Nealon) offer physical fitness instruction
on TV.
   ``They have some of the same elements as the Church Lady, with a
superior attitude, but totally the other way. Instead of being a
54-year-old spinster, I'm a 25-year-old Austrian weight lifter.''
   Hans and Franz epitomize ``vanity obsession with being fit'' _
characters who say, ``I'm superior to you, because I have these
muscles,''' Carvey says.
   ``That's what the real fun of playing these characters is. It's
making fun of those people who really feel they have the truth and
the answers for everybody. Self-righteous, arrogant, `I'm superior
to you' people drive me nuts.''
   Carvey has had other movie offers but has turned them down
because he didn't find the characters very likable.
   ``Mostly, they were kind of glib ... and I just feel that's not
my style,'' he says.
   ``I want to find a different style, someone who's a little more
vulnerable than funny, and then evolves. My whole thing is that
everybody's sort of pretending, just a little bit, that they're a
little bit stronger than they are. Everybody.''

<HEAD>Hong Kong's Brightest Taking Flight in Advance of Chinese Rule</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CINTY LI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With Chinese rule nine years off, many of Hong
Kong's brightest people are moving overseas. Local leaders are
growing increasingly concerned.
   Immigration visa applications are up sharply and businesses
report a rise in the number of professionals resigning to emigrate
before 1997, when this British colony reverts to Chinese
sovereignty and rule from Beijing.
   ``No one knows quite how extensive the problem is, but it's
certainly a problem,'' said Jimmy D. McGregor, director of the Hong
Kong General Chamber of Commerce. ``As 1997 approaches, this
problem becomes more acute.''
   To a large degree, he added, ``it's the perception of China
which is causing people to make that decision to go.''
   Hong Kong, a capitalistic speck on China's southeastern coast,
enjoys one of Asia's highest standards of living.
   The Communist government in Beijing has promised the territory
can retain its capitalist system for 50 years after 1997 and enjoy
a ``high degree of autonomy.''
   But a high percentage of Hong Kong's 5.7 million people are
refugees from China and many are skeptical about Beijing's promises.
   A recent poll by Survey Research Hong Kong, an independent
market research company, indicated one-fifth of Hong Kong's 1.5
million families have at least one member with foreign residency
rights or with the intent to obtain such rights from other
countries.
   Many of the people planning to leave are skilled professionals
and business executives; companies are noticing increased
emigration among top-level employees.
   ``The problem area is in the executive level,'' said Michael
Broadbent, spokesman for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, the
colony's premier bank. About 8 percent of the bank's 670 locally
hired executives resigned to emigrate last year, compared with 3
percent the year before, he said.
   ``Yes, we are concerned about it. No, we are not unduly alarmed.
Nobody likes to lose qualified people who you've invested a lot of
time and money in training.''
   The California-based Bank of America also has noticed a
significant rise in emigration among top-level employees in Hong
Kong, even though it is boosting wages and increasing training
costs, said Senior Vice President Stephen B. Hunt. ``The issue of
turnover is becoming a significant issue in our business.''
   Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a political analyst at Chinese University of
Hong Kong, says that when his friends in their 30s and 40s ``look
around at their friends they can hardly find any people who are
determined to stay.''
   ``They discover that every friend has already secured a
passport, is about to do so, or is in the process of doing so,''
said Cheng.
   The colonial government does not keep emigration statistics.
Although Hong Kong people have a history of resettling overseas,
several indicators show the exodus is increasing.
   Last year, 53,471 people, or nearly 1 percent of the population,
applied for a police document certifying the holder has no criminal
record, an increase of 50 percent from 1986. The document is
required by many countries to obtain visas.
   Statistics from the Australian, Canadian and U.S. consulates
indicate 1987 visa applications were well above previous year
levels, in many cases because of expanded immigration programs for
people with money or professional skills.
   The exodus is causing enough concern that local organizations
are offering a seminar in April on ``how to turn the emigration
exodus to your advantage'' and how to ``create the incentive to
stay.''
   Top government officials have expressed concern about the
emigration rates but argue that many people will return to Hong
Kong once they have obtained a foreign passport.
   They claim many people seek foreign passports primarily as
insurance for after the Chinese take over and estimate as many as
8,000 people returned to Hong Kong in 1986 after obtaining
residency rights in other countries.
   But among the well-educated Hong Kong Chinese holding foreign
passports are those who plan to remain in the colony just long
enough to make money before the Chinese take over.

<HEAD>Willie Nelson, Barry Manilow Have Music Specials on CBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you're heavily into the Bon Jovi and the
Beastie Boys, you're in probably the only demographic group that
won't find something to like in two widely divergent music specials
offered by CBS.
   On Saturday, Willie Nelson is host of his own network special,
``Willie Nelson, Texas Style,'' a tribute to his home state which
he reveals in a soothing hour of country, rock and blues music
combined with an affectionate travelogue to some of his favorite
Lone Star places.
   Then on Monday, Barry Manilow pays homage to jazz and big band
music in ``Barry Manilow: Big Fun on Swing Street,'' set in an
imaginary neighborhood of break dancers, saxophone players and
blues singers, where the '40s meet the '80s.
   Manilow wasn't, shall we say, successful in his last network
venture, the 1985 CBS musical movie ``Copacabana,'' which marked
his acting debut. This time, he sticks to the music. There is no
dialogue in ``Swing Street,'' a bluesy, jazzy, coolly evocative,
extended music video.
   ``There's no dumb sketches on it. We did that on purpose,'' said
Manilow, during a recent break in the midst of his two-year tour.
``Bruce and Jack and I sat down and wrote a conceptual hour that
takes the viewer on a trip down this imaginary place called Swing
Street, during which we meet all the characters who inhabit Swing
Street, and they are played by the guests. There's no talking
except for the voiceovers, and it's all music, because I wanted to
do a music special with a capital M.''
   Bruce and Jack are Manilow's collaborators, Bruce Sussman and
Jack Feldman. Their concept also produced an album, ``Swing
Street,'' that features the performers on the special, plus Stan
Getz, who was in the hospital when the special was taped, Manilow
said.
   Sussman suggested that this kind of high-style music special is
the wave of the future on network television, which still tends to
rely on the standard host-guest-song-sketch kind of variety program.
   ``One of the problems with variety television is that MTV has
forever changed variety television, and it hasn't responded to
that,'' Sussman said. ``This is something else, it's not MTV, but
something that certainly has been influenced by that development.''
   ``Who knows whether this is going to make it rating-wise,'' said
Manilow, ``but what was definitely not making it was somebody
standing up there saying, `My next guest is Dionne Warwick, my next
sketch is,' you know. This sort of had a point of view, even if it
was odd.''
   The special includes Manilow songs such as ``Hey Mambo'' and
``Black and Blue,'' but also standards such as ``Summertime'' and
``Stardust.''
   Manilow's guests are jazz singers Carmen McRae and Diane Schuur
_ her duet with Manilow on ``Summertime'' is a show-stopper _
saxophonists Gerry Mulligan, Tom Scott and Dana Robbins, bass
player Stanley Clarke and singer Phyllis Hyman, plus the vocal
groups Full Swing and Kid Creole and the Coconuts.
   Nelson's special is as bright and sunny as Manilow's is dark and
smoky, with footage of Nelson walking around his Hill Country home,
playing host to his band members and friends on his golf course,
riding his bicycle down to Mona's Yacht Club for a game of dominoes
with the locals, and floating down the Rio Grande with jazz
guitarist Jackie King.
   Next door to the golf course is Willie's own recording studio _
dubbed ``Cut 'n' Putt'' _ where Bruce Hornsby does a session. Ray
Charles joins Willie at Alley Oop's on East Sixth Street in Austin,
and Asleep at the Wheel jams with him at Carl's Corner, a truck
stop.
   Willie also takes a sentimental tour of his boyhood home of
Abbott, Texas, where his sister Bobbie recalls their grandmother
tying young Willie up to keep him from running off.
   ``She staked him just like she did the cow,'' Bobbie laughs.
   ``That didn't stop me from running away,'' Willie recalls. ``It
slowed me down some.''

   Have Americans really changed their spending
habits?
   It is still too early to say, but that might be one of the
developing consequences of the great stock market crash of October.
   Before the crash it was common to hear about the foolish
spending habits of ordinary Americans. Among other criticisms, for
example, it was said that they were living beyond their means,
financing their lifestyle with credit.
   At one point late last year the savings rate fell under 2
percent, a record low. As personal income stagnated, the use of
credit rose.
   It was perhaps the live-for-now consumer style that best
exemplified the time. Jobs were plentiful and money was available,
and enticements of the marketplace left little time for worrying
about future recessions.
   Then came the crash. And while statistics show that only a small
percentage of American households had any direct ownership of
stocks, the suddenness of the decline seemed to shock them into an
awareness of sudden dangers.
   Confidence shrank. Immediately following the crash, the
University of Michigan survey recorded a sharp rise to 45 percent
in the percentage of families expecting bad times financially. Only
38 percent foresaw good times.
   Consumer spending slowed. In fact, in the fourth quarter it
declined from the previous quarter at a 3 percent annual rate.
Motor vehicle and parts purchases fell 36 percent. Furniture and
household equipment dipped 3 percent.
   People even cut into their food budgets. Spending on food fell 2
percent, clothing and shoes 7 percent and gasoline and oil 1
percent. And for the most part, that pattern extended into the
first month of this year.
   Meanwhile, personal saving as a percentage of disposable income
averaged 4.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared to a
third-quarter rate of 2.8 percent. And the higher savings rate
continued into January.
   While it cannot be attributed to the crash, evidence of another
turnabout was becoming clear: The American economy was relying less
on consumption and more on production, a turnabout that had been
awaited for two decades.
   During that long period, Americans seemed willing, able and
happy to hawk their jewels _ personal, industrial and, some critics
maintained, even those of a spiritual nature. It was a time of
great material success, and greed.
   The danger, Americans were told throughout that two-decade
period, was that no nation could continue to consume more than it
produced without wasting its economic power. But consumption
continued nevertheless at every level of life.
   Lately, however, the scene appears to have changed. The growth
of consumption has waned in relation to that of production.
Manufactured goods, not just agricultural products, are being
exported. Money is being saved. And people have a wise eye on the
future.
   The Michigan survey now shows that confidence has returned to
where it was before the crash _ but with a big difference. The
confidence expressed is mainly about the near term, not for the
more distant horizon.
   What appears to have happened is that families are more cautious
judges; they feel safe in expressing confidence over the next year
because they understand the forces at work. They simply don't see a
recession coming.
   But, unlike the pre-crash confidence readings, consumers are
less certain about the next five years. That suggests realism;
nobody can say what might happen five years ahead. That being so,
overconfidence is foolishness.
   The new attitude appears healthier. Goals appear to be more
realistic. Tempered by the crash, people seem aware that an
economic quake is possible, and that the time to deal with the
possibility is now _ not after it happens.

   Vaid Rani Chawla has her dearest wish.
She is going to have a son, after two daughters.
   It means an end to the biting taunts of her mother-in-law and
neighbors. She will gain ``honor'' by having a boy.
   ``I wanted people to say that a son is born in Chawlas' house.
One son is a must,'' said Mrs. Chawla, who now is six months
pregnant.
   She knows for sure it's a boy because she had amniocentesis, a
test many Indian women use to learn the sex of their unborn. If the
test shows a girl is on the way, many women have abortions.
   The practice is drawing fire from social activists who say it is
a perverted use of modern science to perpetuate age-old social
prejudices against women.
   The test is intended to detect congenital deformities, but it
has come to be known as the ``boy-girl test'' in India.
   Widely used in developed countries, amniocentesis is a procedure
in which a small sample of the amniotic fluid that bathes the fetus
in the womb is withdrawn by a long hypodermic needle.
   The fluid contains cells that have flaked off the fetus. The
chromosomes in these cells can be examined for evidence of birth
defects, but they also tell the sex of the fetus.
   ``Boy or Girl _ know the sex of the unborn child,'' say
advertisements by clinics in Indian newspapers.
   Mrs. Chawla, 32, shyly admitted she would have had an abortion
if her test had proved ``negative'' _ meaning another girl.
   There are no definite numbers on how many abortions occur after
such tests. One authoritative study said 78,000 female fetuses were
aborted from 1978 to 1983 nationwide following sex-determination
tests. Abortions are legal in India, a country of 780 million
people, as part of the government's population-control program.
   While the issue has generated demands for banning amniocentesis
clinics, doctors who run the lucrative businesses say it is better
to abort a female fetus than to subject an unwanted child to a life
of suffering.
   ``People are willing to keep producing children until they get a
son,'' said K.K. Loomba, who runs New Delhi's most popular boy-girl
testing clinic. ``Tell me, is it not better to let them have a
choice so they don't have six daughters before they have a son?
   ``Either you should educate the masses that there is no
difference between sons and daughters or give them a choice. This
test, in fact, is helping the population-control program of the
government.''
   But Vibhuti Patel, a women's rights activist from Bombay,
counters: ``By this logic it is better to kill the poor rather then
let them suffer poverty and deprivation.''
   Both sides agree that the answer lies in social education to try
to end entrenched anti-female attitudes.
   In India, sons are looked upon as potential wage earners and as
support for parents in old age. Girls are considered a constant
burden on resources, and money is needed for their dowry at the
time of marriage.
   A developing consumer society has increased demands for dowry
from the traditional jewelry to cars, refrigerators, even houses.
   This has given rise to ``bride burning,'' the killing of young
wives by greedy husbands and in-laws _ usually by setting the women
ablaze with kerosene from kitchen stoves and saying it was an
accident. At least two women die such fiery deaths every day in New
Delhi.
   ``There are no short-term solutions to the problems of women in
India,'' said Madhu Kishwar, editor of Manushi, India's only
feminist magazine. ``Banning amniocentesis is not the answer
because it only will go underground and there will be no
monitoring.''
   Ashok Kumar, a businessman waiting in a clinic while his wife
was being tested, expressed the attitude of many Indians.
   ``We have three daughters,'' he said. ``They will get married
and go away while a son will carry my name forward.''
   Besides, he added, old people and neighbors constantly bothered
his wife about it.
   ``We were made to feel that something was missing.''
   He said that even though he and his wife cannot afford four
children, they decided to take another chance for a son.

   It is estimated that up to 1 percent of
Americans suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, a mental
illness brought on by especially harrowing experiences. While not
limited to a single group, the disorder afflicts as many as half a
million Vietnam veterans. This is one veteran's story.

<TEXT>
   It was before dawn, still dark in the cemetery
where Vietnam veteran John Coughlin was paying another visit to the
graves of two friends. Suddenly, his mind flashed back to Vietnam
where he'd flirted with death, where his legs had been torn by
shrapnel, where he had earned three Purple Hearts.
   Though it was now 1978, long after his return home from battle,
he suddenly sensed that he was under attack. It was May 8, near the
anniversary of a battle in which many of his friends were killed,
and suddenly the Viet Cong seemed all around again.
   He grabbed a shotgun from his car and fired off 14 shots,
yelling insults at the imagined enemy. ``I'm going to get every one
of you that killed my buddies,'' he vowed.
   Some of the shots struck the back of a police station across the
street from the cemetery in Quincy, just south of Boston.
   As police gingerly surrounded him, he shouted, ``I don't want
any hassle. Just leave me alone. I want to die just like Billy and
Jo Jo.''
   John Coughlin died last Nov. 5 alone, save his war souvenirs and
his American and Marine flags. The medical examiner said he died of
an overdose of doxepin, an antidepressant drug. Friends said he
died of a broken heart. He was 42.
   His legacy was that tragic episode in the cemetery that brought
a new awareness to the plight of as many as half a million Vietnam
veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, the delayed
trauma of combat.
   Coughlin was the first Vietnam veteran to successfully use the
syndrome as a defense against criminal charges.
   Charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, he was allowed to
serve two years on probation while undergoing psychiatric
treatment, and the charges were eventually dropped.
   ``I was convinced that regardless which tab you put on it, there
was a mental illness there and no justice would be served in
prosecuting him,'' said Gerald M. Kirby, a former assistant
district attorney who handled the case. ``Fortunately nobody had
been hurt.''
   Although Coughlin was not a crusader for veterans' rights, his
attorney, Lawrence Siskind, said the court's action helped give
recognition to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a serious mental
illness.
   ``This was a court that said there's a problem,'' Siskind said.
``It wasn't just peace groups or veterans groups marching on
Washington anymore. Now somebody could say the VA should do
something, because here it was accepted.''
   Dr. Ted Nadelson, chief of psychiatry services at the Boston VA
Medical Center, said Coughlin ``was kind of a leading edge of a
wedge'' that led to that recognition of the illness.
   Dr. Terence M. Keane, director of the PTSD Center at the VA
Center, said the disorder has been treated for at least 100 years,
but it wasn't until 1980 that the American Psychiatric Association
gave it greater recognition and status by assigning the name.
   In 1981, the VA ruled that veterans could receive
service-connected disability payments if they were diagnosed as
having the stress disorder no matter when it developed after
discharge. Other types of service-connected disabilities must be
claimed within a year of discharge.
   Coughlin was cursed with each of the ills of the disorder _
flashbacks, nightmares, intense depression and anxiety, difficulty
in relationships and the use of alcohol and drugs.
   Vietnam was so difficult for him, and yet, like other veterans,
he couldn't give it up, said Nadelson. ``That is an important issue
for Vietnam veterans, the attachment to it,'' he said.
   Coughlin felt guilt about surviving when friends had been
killed. In the last years of his life, he lived in the past among
his war memorabilia.
   He told friends and relatives a few days before his death that
he wanted to pull his life together. He said he planned to get a
job and move from the room he rented in a three-story rooming house
in Boston where a dozen other tenants lived, some of them, like
him, down on their luck.
   His room resembled a Vietnam bunker, its shades drawn and its
walls painted black. He kept a large American flag on one wall over
the windows. Two smaller American flags were folded away. On the
wall behind his bed hung a Marine flag. Cardboard boxes were filled
with Vietnam snapshots, including a few of Viet Cong bodies, and
newspaper articles on Vietnam, some about him.
   His proudest possession was an American flag his father gave him
when he returned home.
   ``I guess that was the first time my father was proud of me,
when I got decorated in Vietnam,'' he said with tears in his eyes
last July in an 18-minute interview videotaped in color with
Nadelson to help in understanding the stress disorder. He said that
the father of a friend of his had taken the place of his own
father, a businessman who was often busy working.
   Many troubling feelings remained with Coughlin up to his death,
Nadelson said.
   When he signed up for a second Vietnam tour, Coughlin said, it
was not just for flag and country. Part of it was rage.
   ``And liking it,'' he told the psychiatrist. ``Addictive. I'm
talking about killing, the feeling, the power.''
   Coughlin was nervous and emotional on the tape, at times shaking
and weeping. His comments were often disjointed and lacking
elaboration, and at times it was unclear what he meant. One of his
front teeth was missing and he wore a scraggly beard.
   He said he was scared when he first went to Vietnam.
   ``The first couple months there you're afraid. You see
everything. Then it doesn't matter after you see death so much. It
just doesn't matter. You don't allow yourself to have the feelings.
You numb out and then all of a sudden you're put back into people
where things are like it never happened.
   ``You experience life and death, the closeness ... And all of a
sudden you're put back into what they call a real world, a
supposedly civilized world, and you cannot cope. It's not that you
don't want to. It's that you're afraid to get close. You're afraid
to express feelings. The whole atmosphere of people not
understanding ...''

   Like many other veterans who fought in the unpopular war,
Coughlin received hate mail and calls from people who opposed the
war, according to relatives and friends. Typical was one letter
containing a picture of a destroyed village that said, ``You did
this.''
   ``His look and his attitude was that society had basically
thrown him out,'' said Robert Solmente, a boyhood friend. ``I'd say
he died of a broken heart.''
   Coughlin grew up in Braintree, a middle class Boston suburb. His
father died in 1981. His mother and two sisters are his only
immediate survivors. He never married. The family declined to
discuss his case publicly.
   He graduated from Braintree High School in 1963. His loves were
cars and sports.
   John LeRoy, who was Coughlin's football coach at the school and
is now principal, remembered him as an average student but an
idealistic and competitive young man who worked hard. Although a
second-string guard on the team, he rarely, if ever, missed a
practice.
   He enlisted in the Marines on Jan. 12, 1965. Fourteen months
later, he was in Vietnam.
   During one battle, he waded through open rice paddies and
waist-high water under heavy fire to gain a vantage point on enemy
positions and call in artillery fire. For this, he received a
commendation from the commanding general of the 1st Marines.
   Between August and November of 1967, he was wounded three times,
the last time so badly that he had to be evacuated by air from the
battlefield and sent to a Navy hospital near Boston. He was
discharged from the Marines on Oct. 25, 1968.
   ``I had nightmares right from maybe a month, month and a half
after living with my parents,'' Coughlin said. ``They suggested I
go seek help ... wasn't safe to be in the house.''
   For several years, he lived with four or five other veterans in
a house in suburban Holbrook. He went from job to job; he parked
cars for $1.75 an hour, he was a bouncer at a Playboy Club in
Boston, he worked as a salesman. He started drinking heavily and
using drugs to escape.
   From 1970 to the end of his life, he was in and out of VA
hospitals 26 times.
   In September 1984, six years after the flashback in the Quincy
cemetery, he draped a flag over his shoulder at his Holbrook home,
brandished a hunting knife and begged police who were called to the
scene to shoot him. ``He stated that he was like a wounded dog and
should be put out of his misery,'' said Holbrook Police Chief John
White.
   ``It's hard to relate to someone that hasn't experienced what
you have,'' Coughlin said in the taped interview. ``It's hard to
have them understand. It becomes very hard to make the split
between what is real and what is fantasy. The biggest problem is
letting go of the past, especially when you're proud of something
and people are trying to take that away.''
   Despite all of his problems, he said that if he had his life to
live over he would change little, but he might do some things
differently.
   ``I made private first class out of boot camp,'' he recalled.
``Out of 78, four of us got promoted. My father came all the way
down from Boston to South Carolina to see that. I wouldn't trade
that for nothing.''

   Pat Robertson has built a name,
fortune and accelerating political career on a televison network
dedicated to preparing the world for the second coming of Jesus
Christ. Yet the Republican presidential aspirant now bristles at
the label television evangelist.
   ``It's become, in my estimation, a bigoted slur,'' Robertson
said after his second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. Religious
broadcaster is the term he prefers.
   During his 30 years in that field, whatever the label, Robertson
brought charismatic faith and conservative politics to his stands
on social and political issues, including who is fit to govern.
   ``Individual Christians are the only ones, really, and Jewish
people, those who trust the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, are
the only ones that are qualified to have the reign, because,
hopefully, they will be governed by God and submitted to him,''
Robertson said in a 1985 broadcast of his program, ``The 700 Club.''
   Three years later, his political advisers paint Robertson as a
Yale Law School-educated businessman, emphasizing the abilities it
took to build his Christian Broadcasting Network from almost
nothing to the nation's third-largest private cable operation.
   Hardly mentioned these days are the special religious gifts he
has talked of in the past.
   Religious revival is a major part of Robertson's belief. The
secret to revival is powerful prayer, including, some believers
say, speaking in tongues, a state in which a person filled with the
Holy Spirit talks in a language unknown to him and to his listeners.
   Robertson's first such experience with that gift came when his
son Timothy was ill. Robertson has written that the boy had a fever
of 105, was unconscious and experiencing muscle spasms.
   ``I laid my hands on him and cried out again. ... I was suddenly
aware of how much God loved him. ... I just consciously lifted Tim
up to the Lord. ... Suddenly I was aware of the love of God
enfolding him and the power of God going through him. He opened his
eyes, murmured, `Daddy, I gotta go to the bathroom.'''
   In his joy at his son's recovery and in his efforts to praise
God, Robertson said he began speaking in tongues.
   With revival and prayer also comes healing, a major part of
Robertson's past fund-raising telethons. He described one incident
that occurred during a telethon.
   ``I grabbed one of the ringing phones and heard a little child
on the other end saying she had a terrible scar on her face and
wanted me to pray that God would remove it. I prayed and hung up.
Seconds later the phone rang again. It was the girl's grandmother.
   ``She was almost hysterical. `My grandchild hung up the phone
and turned around and the scar, that horrible scar, was gone. ...
God had wiped it off her face!'''
   During other telethons, according to Robertson:
   _An 84-year-old man who had been blind for three years had his
sight restored. So did the blind piano player on ``The 700 Club.''
   _A woman was healed, on camera, of arthritis of her spine.
   _A baby's twisted foot was healed before the eyes of her father.
   _And 25 people were instantly healed of deafness.
   Besides the ability to speak in tongues and heal, Robertson in
his autobiography credits the Holy Spirit with giving him other
gifts.
   ``One of the manifestations of the Holy Spirit that was
operative in my life was the word of knowledge. I could tell,
almost instantaneously, if a person was speaking the truth or
falsehood,'' he said.
   Robertson also says his belief carries the gift of prophecy.
   In a 1980 mailing to ``The 700 Club'' members, Robertson said
the European Economic Community was the beast with seven heads and
10 horns prophesied in the Bible, and that the anti-Christ will
emerge from it.
   ``This anti-Christ would bring great persecution to Christians
and Jews. Given the current European disdain for both the Christian
gospel and the nation of Israel, it is not hard to imagine parts of
the Book of Revelations coming to pass,'' Robertson said.
   If his calculations were correct, he said, the anti-Christ was
27 years old and ``being groomed to be the Satanic Messiah.''
   Robertson's strong support for Israel is based on his
interpretation of the Bible, which he believes prophesies the end
of the world.
   In his 1984 book ``Answers to 200 of Life's Most Probing
Questions,'' Robertson wrote, ``We are getting very close to the
time when God is going to say that the human race has gone far
enough. That is why I firmly expect to be alive when Jesus Christ
comes to Earth.''
   During a 1981 ``The 700 Club'' program, Robertson said the
United States is referred to only once in the Bible but will play
an important role in the world's end by offering aid to Israel in
its fight againt the Palestinians.
   ``The Palestinians have been raping, killing and bombing
innocent Israelis for years,'' Robertson said.
   While Robertson may play down his religious gifts and background
as he seeks the Republican nomination, his supporters do not.
   In 1986, when Robertson announced that he was considering a run
for the presidency, he was introduced by the Rev. Harold Bredsen,
who said, ``Only a man who God has anointed, only a man who loves
God and, whatever cost, obeys God _ only that man can lead us in
this hour. We are here tonight because we belive that you, Pat, you
are that man.''
   Supporters still see him in that light, according to the Rev.
Billy McCormack, director of Robertson's Freedom Council in
Louisiana.
   ``They really do feel that the time has come for God to raise up
a man _ as he has in past history _ Daniel, Gideon, David, Paul,
Nehemiah and John the Baptist,'' McCormack said.

<HEAD>Ten Men: Their Visions for America</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leadership. Moral strength. Excellence in
education. Toughness.
   It is on words such as these that presidential campaigns are
built.
   Each of the 10 candidates has fashioned his campaign around one
or more themes, seeking to convince voters that his is the right
vision to lead America into the 1990s.
   With voters in 20 states holding primaries or caucuses this
Tuesday, here are snapshots of the candidates and the issues they
are running on.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Republicans</HEAD>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GEORGE BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush is running, more than anything else, as Ronald Reagan's
co-pilot.
   ``I am proud to have stood with this president through thick and
through thin, and in good times and bad times, next to Ronald
Reagan, without cutting and running,'' the vice president told
supporters in Dallas last month.
   Bush has vowed, ``I'm not going to raise taxes, period,'' and he
has called for lowering the tax on capital gains from 28 percent to
15 percent. ``I want to be the fellow to hold the line on the
taxes, and the way to do it is to discipline the Congress, not the
American people,'' he says on the stump.
   Bush also says repeatedly he wants to be known as ``the
education president.'' He calls education ``the best answer to
poverty'' and the surest route to jobs. He has promised to boost
funding for Head Start, a pre-school program for poor children, and
to maintain Pell Grants, college scholarships based on need.
   Bush also has proposed a new form of U.S. savings bonds that
would allow parents to earn interest tax-free on bonds for their
children's college education. Bush hints that he will be more
generous than Reagan in funding other education programs and
fighting illiteracy, a cause his wife, Barbara, has championed.
   Bush, 63, stresses his experience as a congressman, director of
the Central Intelligence Agency, ambassador to the United Nations
and envoy to China and, since 1981, vice president. He was an early
and ardent supporter of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
treaty with the Soviets and has said he would press aggressively
for further arms control breakthroughs, including a ban on chemical
weapons.
   ``I've been to 74 countries as your vice president, met most of
the world leaders,'' he says, boasting that he will be ready to
provide strong leadership in foreign affairs from his first day in
the Oval Office.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BOB DOLE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``He's one of us,'' the Dole campaign likes to tell voters.
   ``I believe my lifetime record of public service _ from the
battlefield to Capitol Hill _ offers the kind of leadership the
country is looking for as we face the tremendous challenges that
lie ahead,'' says the Kansas senator.
   Dole, 64, is running as a conservative, pragmatic lawmaker who
has mastered the art of compromise in his 19 years in the U.S.
Senate, including two years as majority leader. ``I've made the
tough choices,'' he says.
   Dole espouses a modified spending freeze to balance the federal
budget by 1993. He has suggested limiting every program, including
Social Security, to budget increases of two percent in order to end
the deficits as high as $230 bilion a year that have doubled the
national debt during the Reagan years.
   Dole often cites the key role he played five years ago in
forging a compromise that ended a half-decade of financial turmoil
for the Social Security system.
   Dole backed the INF treaty after some initial hesitation. He is
also sponsoring legislation to provide $400 million in grants to
help pay for child care. He has refused to say he would not raise
taxes under any circumstances.

<HEAD>JACK KEMP</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The upstate New York congressman and former professional
football quarterback is the champion of free enterprise,
supply-side economics, low taxes and the status quo in Social
Security, including full cost-of-living increases.
   Kemp, 52, a nine-term congressman, is an enthusiastic supporter
of the Strategic Defense Initiative who has promised a full and
early deployment of a space-based anti-missile system. He has
opposed the INF treaty.
   Kemp is an ardent free-trader who has promised to veto any
``protectionist'' trade legislation. He has sponsored legislation
to set up a North American free-trade zone.
   In reply to a questionnaire from a non-partisan group, the
Roosevelt Center for American Studies, Kemp said he was running as
an alternative to candidates in both parties ``who look to the
future with such anxiety and pessimism that they can think only of
ideas that would impose austerity and pain, protectionism and
isolationism. They would meet the challenge of budget deficits by
increasing taxes, cutting back on Social Security benefits for the
elderly, and weakening our national defense.
   ``They would meet the challenge of competition by raising new
walls to foreign imports. And they would meet the challenge of
securing global peace by conceding territory and human freedom to
those who respect the rights of neither. I believe there is a
better way, a more confident way, and that is why I am running for
president.''

<HEAD>PAT ROBERTSON</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The former television evangelist and founder of the Christian
Broadcasting Network says he is running to arrest the ``moral
decay'' that he believes is eroding the American family and
American institutions.
   A critic of the INF treaty, Robertson promises to take a tough
stand against communism. He has claimed repeatedly that the Soviet
Union has secretly installed nuclear missiles in Cuba.
   He is a pronounced critic of public education and supporter of
aid for private education.
   He has called the federal deficit the single worst problem
facing the country, and contends he could save billions of dollars
by squeezing waste and attacking mismanagement in the federal
bureaucracy.
   Robertson, 57, has said he would ``shift away from welfare
programs which encourage family breakup.'' He has suggested
increased the personal deduction for children, and said that if
working women get tax deductions for child-care, mothers who stay
home to raise their children should also receive tax breaks.
   Robertson has said that the other candidates are too focused on
government programs, when the real problem underlying the United
States' economic problems ``is moral decay.''
   ``We need as a people to come together and say we will restore
the greatness of America through moral strength,'' says Robertson.

<HEAD>MICHAEL DUKAKIS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis, 54, is running largely on his record in his nine years
as governor of Massachusetts, a state that has bolted out of the
economic doldrums in the past decade.
   The son of Greek immigrants, Dukakis says the message of his
campaign is ``good jobs and real opportunity'' for all, with
special emphasis on education and research.
   Speaking of his own family's success story, Dukakis says, ``I am
running for president because I believe all Americans have a right
to share in that dream. I believe I have the strength to run this
country, the experience to manage our government, and the values to
lead our people.''
   He says the United States cannot stand ``four more years of
credit-card economics.'' But he has proposed tougher tax
collection, not tax increases, as the key to reducing the deficit,
and claimed it could bring in as much as $110 billion from tax
scofflaws and cheats.
   He has been an outspoken critic of the Reagan administration's
Strategic Defense Initiative and its aid to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   He proposes to expand support for education and overhaul welfare
programs along the lines of Massachusetts' successful effort to
place welfare recipients in jobs.
   Dukakis has also proposed a universal health insurance program
for workers in his home state and asked, ``Isn't is about time that
this nation committed itself to basic health security for its
citizens?''
   He has espoused public-private partnerships to tackle problems
such as housing and homelessness.
   He opposes the Gephardt amendment in the House-passed trade
bill, which would mandate automatic U.S. retaliation against
countries that fail to trim their trade supluses.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RICHARD GEPHARDT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   No candidate has summarized his campaign in fewer words than
Gephardt, 47, a veteran of six terms in Congress from St. Louis,
Mo.: ``It's your fight, too!''
   Behind those pugnacious words is a candidate who has led efforts
in Congress to take a tough stance against countries with huge
imbalances in their trade accounts with the United States.
   To his critics, the Gephardt amendment to the trade bill smacks
of protectionism that could lead the world into a tariff war with
no winners.
   But for Gephardt, with his now famous commercial about the
$48,000 Hyundai _ which is what he claims the Korean car would sell
for if the U.S. applied the same tariffs that the Koreans do on
imports _ it is simply a way of letting the world know that the
United States means business.
   Gephardt voted for President Reagan's big cut in tax rates in
1981. He has been a leading opponent of aid to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.
   He has called for a new agriculture policy to help family
farmers, and accused corporate America of being greedy and
short-sighted.
   Once an opponent of abortion, Gephardt now opposes efforts to
pass a constitutional amendment to make abortion illegal.

   The Tennessee senator, who turns 40 on March 31, has tried to
establish himself as the conservative in the Democratic field,
although he has been a liberal on social issues and health programs
during his 11 years in Congress (the past three in the Senate).
   ``I choose to stand up for what I believe in: an end to the arms
race, environmental protection, better schools and economic
strength,'' says Gore.
   Gore has voted in the past for humanitarian aid for the Contra
rebels, although he opposed the Reagan administration's most recent
request. He opposes military aid to the Contras.
   The son of a senator, Gore has built his campaign around a
Southern strategy, hoping that a strong showing there will
vindicate his decision not to contest the Iowa caucuses and New
Hampshire primary.
   He claims to differ from the other Democrats with his support
for Reagan policy in the Persian Gulf, the invasion of Grenada and
the Midgetman missile.

<HEAD>GARY HART</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Hart, the former Colorado senator, has hitched his off-again,
on-again campaign to his ``new ideas,'' including military reform
and economic restructuring.
   He has offered the most detailed budget blueprint of any
candidate, outlining plans to cut the deficit by more than $100
billion by 1993 and to balance it by 1995.
   His blueprint includes cuts in military spending and farm
subsidies. He would raise the minimum wage and provide more aid for
schools and colleges. He wants to impose a $10-per-barrel fee on
oil imports and keep the top tax rate at 33 percent for
upper-income taxpayers.
   Hart would also make wealthy Social Security recipients pay
income taxes on 85 percent of their benefits, tax capital gains at
death, raise cigarette and liquor taxes, and impose a 10-percent
levy on purchases of furs, planes and other luxuries.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JESSE JACKSON</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Baptist minister and civil rights leader has called for
major cuts in Pentagon spending and major increases in federal
spending on schools and other social programs.
   Jackson, 46, a native of South Carolina who now lives in
Chicago, has called for ``an end to economic violence.''
   ``There's something wrong when corporate owners make exhorbitant
profits while workers lose their jobs,'' says Jackson. ``The
workers must unite across lines and race, sex and religion.''
   Jackson has called Star Wars ``an impossible technological
solution to a political problem. It will cost over a trillion
dollars if pursued, and in the end will not produce a defense but
an arms race in the heavens.''
   He has proposed keeping a 38.5 percent tax bracket for wealthy
Americans and promised to reduce the deficit by cutting military
spending ``without cutting our defense, make corporations and the
wealthy pay their fair share of taxes and put America back to
work.''
   Jackson says reducing the trade deficit will require
``controlling U.S.-based multi-nationals which close U.S. factories
and take jobs overseas'' and ``increasing Third World living
standards so they can buy more from us.''

<HEAD>PAUL SIMON</HEAD>

   ``I'm not a neo-anything,'' boasts the Illinois senator. ``I'm a
Democrat.''
   ``I'm proud to stand up for the values of Franklin Roosevelt,
Harry Truman and Jack Kennedy. I stand for leadership that cares,''
he told the Roosevelt Center.
   Simon is a longtime supporter of federal education programs and
author of 11 books, including one decrying Americans' ignorance of
foreign languages.
   To get people back to work, Simon has proposed an $8 billion,
last-resort public works program that would pay 10 percent more
than welfare or unemployment could offer.
   He has promised to send Congress within 60 days of taking office
``a comprehensive long-term (care) program that will move on the
huge unmet long-term care needs our society has.''
   He believes that reducing the unemployment rate and lowering
interest rates are the keys to cutting the federal deficit. If
necessary, he says, he will seek an income tax surcharge on the
wealthy.

<HEAD>Modern Broilers Involve More Than Chicken Feed, Says USDA Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Broiler chickens, you might say, have more
than kept abreast of the times, they have a leg up on most other
farming operations.
   Indeed, says an Agriculture Department report on the nation's
broiler industry, raising chickens these days ``seems more like a
factory assembly line'' than part of farming's livestock sector.
   Consider what has happened to broiler production and consumption
in the United States, remembering that the young birds were once
called frying chickens, or fryers, and were a seasonal treat for
most families.
   Now, broilers are everywhere and in many forms, packaged whole
or cut up; in specialized parts such as wings, legs and breasts;
ready to cook; even cooked, baked or barbecued. Not to mention all
the fast-food variations.
   ``This highly integrated, efficiency conscious industry
virtually exploded with growth after specialized broiler operations
emerged in the late 1930s and early 1940s,'' the report said.
``Unlike more diverse beef and hog industries, broiler production
is now dominated by a handful of operators, most of whom control
their products from incubation to retail.''
   When a hog or cattle producer has ``finished'' animals ready for
market, they are sold live to a slaughter plant, which in turn may
sell the carcasses at wholesale to other buyers. Eventually, the
beef and pork reaches consumers.
   But the broiler sector's first point of sale typically is not at
the farm, the report said. It's later when the slaughtered, cut up
or ready-to-cook birds are sold to wholesalers or retailers.
   The report is in the March issue of Farmline magazine published
by the department's Economic Research Service. Most of the article
is attributed to economist Lee Christensen.
   ``Improved genetics, better balanced rations and environmentally
controlled housing increased producers' efficiency in raising
chickens,'' the report said. ``This helped the industry produce
large amounts of economically priced product and capture a greater
portion of the market for meat.''
   Christensen cited some statistics to back up that assertion:
   _Growers turn out heavier birds in less time. A broiler weighing
3{ to 4{ pounds can be produced in 7 to 8 weeks, about half the 12
t0 14 weeks it took 30 years ago.
   _It takes only about 2 pounds of feed or less to grow a pound of
broiler, down from 4 pounds of feed to 1 pound of bird in the 1940s.
   _As a result, the average time it takes to raise a group of
birds, or brood, is nearly two weeks shorter than a decade ago,
allowing growers to produce an extra brood each year. Most turn out
more than six broods annually.
   ``Behind the increase in production has been a corresponding
rise in consumption,'' the report said. ``Much of it occurred while
meat consumption levels in general were climbing. Now, however,
overall meat consumption is leveling off, while broiler consumption
continues to rise.''
   The report added: ``In all, consumption grew more than 29-fold,
from about two pounds per person in 1940 to an estimated 60 pounds
in 1987.''
   As broilers became specialized, great shudders ran through the
poultry industry. Christensen said the independently owned
small-flock operations that marketed chickens through small
processing plants disappeared, giving way to a highly integrated
industry dominated by relatively few processors.
   Most of these firms, he said, are located in northeastern
Arkansas, northern Georgia and Alabama, central Missouri, eastern
Texas, the Delmarva Peninsula of Delaware and Maryland, North
Carolina and central California.
   ``In 1984, 134 firms _ operating 238 federally inspected plants
_ processed more than 4 billion birds weighing nearly 18 billion
pounds,'' Christensen said. ``The four largest firms during that
year operated 41 plants that slaughtered 33.7 percent of all the
broilers produced.''
   By comparison, he said, in 1964, 201 firms operated 320 plants
and slaughtered a third fewer chickens.
   A typical firm might include a hatchery, feed mill, processing
plant, and field service, management and marketing staffs, he said.
The birds are produced under contracts with growers who provide the
facilities and management. Typically, it takes 150 to 300 contracts
to provide a processor's annual needs.
   The farmer, or grower, also has experienced concentration. In
1982, the U.S. agricultural census showed 30,100 farms producing
broilers, down from 42,185 in 1959. But total output rose to 3.5
billion birds from 1.4 billion during the same period, with the
average rising to 116,844 birds in 1982 from 33,637 in 1959.
   Also, the number of broiler farms that each year sell more than
100,000 birds increased to 13,214 in 1982 and represented 89
percent of total production. In 1959, there were only 2,254 of the
large farms, and they accounted for less than 29 percent of total
output.
   Christensen said many problems remain, including cycles of
production and prices, and disease outbreaks. But chicken
consumption will probably continue to climb for some time, fueled
by a growing population and rising per capita consumption, perhaps
to 67 pounds by 1990 and 95 pounds per person by the turn of the
century, he said.
   The broiler industry, however, will not be easy for newcomers,
meaning that future growth will have to come from existing firms.
   ``New firms cannot afford to jump into the business of raising
chickens,'' Christensen said. ``The capital investment needed to
establish new broiler production and processing facilities is very
large, and would be undertaken only after careful analysis.''

   A 9 percent decline in new home sales in
January pushed sales activity to its slowest pace since the end of
the last recession.
   A downturn in housing often has been a harbinger of recession,
but analysts said Wednesday they believed falling mortgage rates
offered hope of a rebound in home sales in coming months.
   The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes
fell in January for the third consecutive month, dropping to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 535,000 units. That was the
slowest pace since the last recession was ending in December 1982.

   Private economists say the 0.6 percent decline
in orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods in January may
not be as serious as it first appears.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday orders for both durable
and non-durable goods dropped to a seasonally adjusted $212.6
billion in January, down $1.25 billion from December, when orders
rose 2 percent.
   It was the first setback in orders since a 1.4 percent drop in
August, but economists noted it reflected a swing in the volatile
transportation category.

   Federated Department Stores Inc. has agreed to
be acquired by R.H. Macy & Co., but an undaunted Campeau Corp.
proceeded with its rival bid for the nation's fifth largest
retailer.
   Federated and Macy said Wednesday they had signed a definitive
agreement under which Macy would begin a cash tender offer of
$74.50 a share for about 80 percent of Federated's 89.6 million
outstanding shares, or a total of $5.25 billion. Stock in the
merged company was included in the deal.
   Campeau said late Wednesday it was increasing its previously
announced $66 cash tender offer to an effective $68 a share.

   Sears, Roebuck & Co. says it was beginning a

   The restructuring, which will trim an undetermined number of

stores more responsive to customer needs and wants, officials said
Wednesday.

   Banks recorded their least profitable year
since the Great Depression in 1987, but a top federal regulator
sees better days ahead.
   The nation's federally insured commercial banks earned $3.7
billion last year on assets of $3 trillion, down from $17.5 billion
earnings in 1986, L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., said Wednesday. But he said the drop in
earnings was due entirely to large banks adding to reserves to
cover anticipated losses on Third World loans.

   Oil futures prices remain weak amid confusion
over the true level of U.S. oil reserves.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for April
delivery closed 5 cents lower at $15.67 per 42-gallon barrel
Wednesday. The contract had been down as much as 30 cents early in
the day.
   Among refined products, wholesale gasoline for April delivery
finished at 44.90 cents per gallon, off .39 cent.
   Near-term contracts for wholesale heating oil moved counter to
the market's bearish trend with the contract for April delivery
settling at 43.93 cents per gallon, up .46 cent.
   Analysts said reports of relatively low supplies of heating oil,
compared to levels of previous years, touched off the buying in
that sector.
   But in general, analysts said the market was confused by
discrepancies in official estimates of crude oil reserves as
compiled by the American Petroleum Institute and the Department of
Energy.
   A gap between the estimates issued in recent weeks has put
traders on the defensive.
   ``There is a scarcity of hard fundamental information right
now,'' observed William Byers, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co.
``We've come to the end of the heating seasons, and traders are
looking for something to hold on to.''

<HEAD>Forstmann Little Offers To Top AFG Buyout Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AFG Industries Inc., which last week agreed to
be taken private in a $940.5 million buyout by its chairman, is
being confronted by a competing, higher offer.
   The investment partnership Forstmann Little & Co. offered
Wednesday to acquire AFG for more than $33 cash a share, although
it conditioned the size of the premium on its ability to meet with
management and to review internal corporate information.
   AFG announced Feb. 25 that it had agreed to a two-step buyout
valued at $33 a share by a new company by a new company headed by
AFG founder and chairman, R.D. Hubbard.
   That offer would pay $33 cash a share for 94 percent of AFG's
stock and $33 per share in preferred stock or a combination of cash
and stock, for the rest of the shares. Based on AFG's 28.5 million
common shares outstanding, the offer had an indicated value of
$940.5 million.
   AFG rose 12{ cents to $32.25 a share Wednesday on the New York
Stock Exchange. The new offer was announced hours after the market
closed.
   Forstmann Little, which specializes in leveraged buyouts, stated
its offer was not conditioned on financing commitments being
obtained. It indicated its decision on the final size of its buyout
offer depended on ``prompt receipt and evaluation of information
regarding the company'' and on an opportunity to meet with AFG
management.
   The firm stated it was capitalized at about $2.7 billion, with
$2.4 billion of that available for future acquisitions.
   Irvine, Calif.-based AFG, one of North America's leading makers
of flat glass, declined through a spokesman to comment on the
proposal.
   Forstmann Little is in the process of acquiring Stanadyne Corp.,
a major manufacturer of plumbing fixtures and diesel fuel injection
systems, in an $820 million leveraged buyout.
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with
borrowed funds that are repaid with the target company's cash flow
or by the sale of its assets.
   The firm also has led buyouts of Lear Siegler Inc., Dr Pepper
Co., Sybron Corp. and Topps Co. Inc. in recent years.
   Analysts widely had expected competing offers to emerge for AFG,
deeming the Hubbard bid as relatively low.
   Hubbard's offer was made by Clarity Holdings Corp., a newly
formed company headed by Hubbard.
   AFG became well recognized outside its own industry in 1986 when
it launched an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid for Lear Siegler,
the aerospace and manufacturing conglomerate based in Santa Monica,
Calif.
   In 1987, AFG made an unsucessful hostile bid for Gencorp. of
Akron, Ohio, which formerly was known as General Tire & Rubber Co.
   Late last year, AFG announced it had agreed to purchase Ford
Motor Co.'s glass-making operations in Canada, which with annual
sales of about $150 million was the industry leader in that
country. No terms were disclosed for that deal, which closed early
this year.

   A merger agreement with R.H. Macy & Co. hasn't
dampened the frenzied bidding for Federated Department Stores Inc.,
as rival suitor Campeau Corp. has escalated its attempt to acquire
the nation's fifth-largest retailer.
   Following Federated's announcement Wednesday that it had agreed
to be acquired by Macy for cash and stock worth more than $5.45
billion, Campeau sharply revised its own all-cash proposal in an
attempt to woo Federated shareholders.
   Federated and Macy said they had a definitive agreement under
which Macy would acquire Federated and form a new company,
Macy's-Federated Inc. The deal still must be approved by
shareholders of both companies.
   Macy, the nation's 10th-largest retailer, operates 96 stores in
14 states, while Federated has 650 stores _ including such
department stores as Bloomingdale's, Filene's and Bullock's _ in 36
states.
   Under the agreement, Macy would pay $74.50 a share in cash for
about 80 percent of Federated's 89.6 million outstanding shares, or
a total of $5.25 billion. The remaining Federated shares would be
exchanged for stock in the new company.
   Campeau, which had been offering $68 a share _ totaling $6.1
billion _ for all of the outstanding Federated shares, responded by
changing its offer to $75 a share for 80 percent of Federated's
stock. In a subsequent merger, Campeau would pay $44 a share for
the remaining stock, giving the total deal a combined value of $68
per share, Campeau said.
   Campeau also said it would file suit to challenge $45 million in
fees that Federated agreed to pay Macy if their deal fell through.
If the fees are invalidated or withdrawn, Campeau said it would pay
$46.20 per share for the 20 percent of Federated shares remaining
after a merger.
   Campeau's new proposal expires at midnight EST March 15.
   The amended Campeau bid was announced after the close of trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, where Federated's stock fell $1 a
share to $66.75.
   Wall Street analysts said it was hard to predict what
Federated's shareholders would do, given the difficulty of putting
a value on the stock portion of Macy's offer.
   Macy is privately held, so it is difficult to know how much its
shares are worth.
   ``It's really tough to figure out which is a better deal,'' said
Joseph Ronning, a retail industry analyst with Brown Brothers
Harriman & Co.
   ``If you want immediate money, go for cash'' in the Campeau
offer, said Monroe H. Greenstein, an analyst with Bear Stearns &
Co. Inc.
   But in the long term, Greenstein said, he considered the Macy
bid better because it offered better potential for future growth
for Federated.
   No matter who ends up controlling Federated, the new owner is
expected to sell the company's Gold Circle discount stores and
Ralphs supermarkets.
   Among Cincinnati-based Federated's department stores are the
Bloomingdale's, Burdine's, Filene's, I. Magnin., Rich's, Abraham &
Straus and Lazarus chains.
   Either Macy or Campeau were expected to sell several of those
chains if they acquired Federated. Abraham and Straus and Rich's
were considered likely candidates for a sale by Macy, because they
are direct competitors with Macy stores in New York and Atlanta,
respectively.
   Under the Macy agreement, Federated management would have a
strong voice in the new company, filling 40 percent of the seats on
its board of directors.
   However, Federated Chairman Howard Goldfeder, 61, said at a news
conference Wednesday he would resign after helping Macy Chairman
Edward Finkelstein implement the merger.
   Goldfeder said he expects to be paid $3.06 million when he
leaves the company under a ``golden parachute'' severance agreement
approved by Federated's board of directors. Similar payments are
due other top Federated officers.
   In deciding to merge with Macy, the Federated board had
considered the $68 a share Campeau merger offer as well as an
indication from Campeau that the offer could be increased to $69.50
under certain unspecified conditions, Macy and Federated said.
   The companies stated that Federated's board had turned down
Campeau's alternative $66-a-share tender offer as inadequate, but
it did not characterize the $68 and $69.50 bids.
   Federated refused to elaborate on the statement, and Macy
referred all questions on the board's discussion to Federated.
   New York-based Macy was taken private by a management group in a
$3.6 billion leveraged buyout in 1986. Its stores rang up $5.21
billion in sales during the fiscal year ended last Aug. 1.
   Campeau, through its Allied Stores division, owns the Jordan
Marsh, Stern's, Ann Taylor and Maas Brothers chains.

   Federated Department Stores Inc. traces its
roots to Columbus, Ohio, where German immigrant Simon Lazarus Sr.
opened a men's clothing store in 1848.
   Since then, the business has evolved into the nation's fifth
largest general retailer with more than 650 department stores,
supermarkets and specialty and discount stores.
   The store opened by Lazarus developed into F&R Lazarus Co., a
department store chain.
   In 1929, Fred Lazarus Jr. and Simon Lazarus, grandsons of the
company founder, formed Federated Department Stores with Filene's
in Boston and Abraham & Straus in Brooklyn. Bloomingdale's in New
York joined three months later.
   Today, the company's divisions also include Bullock's,
Burdine's, Foley's, I. Magnin and Rich's department stores; Main
Street and Children's Place specialty stores; and Gold Circle
discount stores and Ralphs supermarkets.
   Federated was based in Columbus for its first 16 years, acting
as a holding company for its founders. It moved its headquarters to
Cincinnati near the end of World War II and became an operating
company.
   The company rang up sales of $11 billion last year.

   R.H. Macy & Co. Inc., whose holdings include the
largest store in the world, returned to private ownership in early
1986 when a management group bought the nation's 10th biggest
general retailer for $3.58 billion.
   That has been the biggest acquisition of a retailer, although
the deal will fall to second if Macy succeeds in its bid to acquire
Federated Department Stores Inc. for $5.25 billion in cash plus
securities.
   Macy is widely known for its rivalry with its now defunct New
York competitor, Gimbel's department store, and as the subject of
the perennial Christmas movie favorite ``Miracle on 34th Street.''
The movie centered on Macy's popular Thanksgiving Day parade, which
celebrates the arrival of Santa Claus at Macy's flagship store on
New York's Herald Square each year.
   Started in 1858 by Rowland Hussey Macy, a former Nantucket
whaler who had failed at several earlier attempts in the retailing
business, the first Macy store in downtown Manhattan sold fancy
goods and stationery items.
   The company was acquired in 1896 by Isadore and Nathan Straus,
and it began selling stock to the public in 1927 as it expanded
into a nationwide operation.
   Macy operates 96 stores in 14 states, including Macy's
department stores and Aeropostale, Charter Club and Morgan Taylor's
Fantasy specialty stores.
   Its Macy's store at Herald Square in New York has 2.151 million
square feet of space, making it the world's largest store and as
big as some shopping centers.

<HEAD>Trade Group: U.S. Electronics Imports Outpaced Exports Again In
1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States continued to import more
electronics than it exported last year, although exports increased
at the fastest pace since 1980, the Electronic Industries
Association said today.
   Exports of electronic products grew to $40 billion last year, 20
percent over the $33.4 billion in 1986, while imports rose to
nearly $57.9 billion, up 15 percent from $50.3 billion in 1986, the
trade group said.
   Peter F. McCloskey, the group's president, said a lower dollar,
improved quality and aggressive marketing are making U.S. exports
more competitive in the world marketplace.
   In 1980, exports rose 21 percent over the previous year, while
imports rose 13 percent. But between 1981 and 1986, the increase in
imports outpaced the rise in exports, the association said.
   The trade group also said its analysis of Commerce Department
figures showed Canada was the No. 1 importer of U.S. electronics
last year, buying more than $5 billion worth. The United Kingdom
ranked second at $3.9 billion, Japan was third with $3.8 billion
and West Germany was fourth at $3.1 billion.
   Japan continued to top the list of foreign suppliers of
electronic products to the United States, with sales of nearly $25
billion last year, the group said. It was followed by Taiwan with
nearly $5.6 billion in sales, Korea with $4.3 billion and Singapore
with $4.0 billion.

<HEAD>Import Car Sales Start Suffering from Higher Prices</HEAD>

   Three years of price increases are beginning to
take their toll on foreign car sales, as buyers taking another look
at American models find improved cars with stickers as much as
$2,000 lower than comparable imports.
   Automakers in Japan and Western Europe have been forced to raise
prices to compensate for the plummeting dollar, which has fallen 50
percent against their currencies since 1985.
   While the European companies felt the bite sooner, industry
analysts said Japanese car sales also appear to be softening,
particularly for smaller companies and Nissan, which has been hurt
by a lack of new products.
   ``There is definitely suffering,'' said Thomas O'Grady, industry
analyst with Integrated Automotive Resources in Wayne, Pa.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have
turned the weak dollar to their advantage by holding down prices
instead of matching their foreign competitors increase-for-increase
as before.
   ``They are all looking at 1988 as the year of the return of the
domestic (car) or the start of that return,'' said Chris Cedergren,
industry analyst with J.D. Power and Associates in Agoura Hills,
Calif.
   Price increases have added as much as $6,000 to the sticker of a
German car and $3,000 for a Japanese model since the dollar began
falling. The price difference between a Japanese car and a
comparable American model has reached $1,500 to $2,000, analysts
said.
   Japanese car prices have risen nearly 25 percent in the past
three years. European autos have risen less on a percentage basis
but more in dollar terms because they predominantly are luxury
models that cost more to start with.
   European makers felt the pinch from the weak dollar first
because Japanese auto prices had a built-in cushion: U.S. dealers
faced with heavy demand had been tacking $1,000 to $2,000 on to the
sticker price and still selling all the cars they could get.
   Buyers didn't begin to notice that Japanese cars were growing
more expensive until late in 1986, when dealers had used up the
cushion and began raising prices. But even then, the difference
meant only a few dollars more in monthly payments.
   Furthermore, buyers who had been weaned from American cars by
the quality and reliability of Japanese cars were willing to pay a
little extra for the imports, said Joseph Phillippi, analyst with
Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York.
   As a result, while total car sales declined 10.7 percent in
1987, Japanese import car sales fell only 9.7 percent while GM,
Ford and Chrysler's domestic car sales together fell 16.7 percent.
   The currency-related price increases pushed European makers such
as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche further into the ultra-luxury
stratosphere with new cars that cost $40,000 to $70,000, and pushed
many buyers out of the market.
   During January, sales fell by about 28 percent for
Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Porsche, 51 percent for Alfa-Romeo and 60
percent for Peugeot.
   But the Japanese fought back. Companies such as Toyota Motor
Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. accepted smaller
profits and squeezed steady efficiency improvements out of their
factories at home to protect their U.S. market share.
   Helped by the strength of the Japanese yen, used to buy raw
materials from weaker-currency nations, they were able to keep
price increases so small that the Big Three accused them of
predatory pricing in the United States.
   They also began shifting some production to the United States
and began offering or planning cars to fill the void left by the
Europeans in the $20,000 to $30,000 luxury market.
   But despite their efforts, higher prices have begun to hurt
Japanese car sales. While Toyota and Honda remain strong, other
makes are showing signs of strain.
   In January, Nissan's import car sales fell 19.6 percent in
January from a year ago and Isuzu's sales fell 16.7 percent.
Japanese makers also are reporting higher inventories of unsold
cars and are increasing their use of buyer incentives, analysts
said.
   Still, they warn, the Big Three have only a limited time to take
full advantage of the import weakness and win back some of the
buyers they lost to the Japanese earlier in the decade because the
Japanese will adapt to the new currency level.
   ``The Japanese will have fully adjusted within 18 months from
now,'' O'Grady said.

<HEAD>Volcker Named To Princeton Professorship, Chairman Of Banking Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tiny investment banker James D.
Wolfensohn Inc. has gotten a big name to hang out his shingle at
the firm: former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.
   Volcker was named Wednesday as chairman of the New York-based
firm, and also as a professor at Princeton University.
   The announcements ended the months of speculation over Volcker's
next career move that followed his decision last year not to accept
another term at the Fed.
   Volcker's international reputation and widespread connections
stemming from his tenure at the central bank were highly prized by
Wall Street, and his decision to join Wolfensohn represents a coup
for the firm.
   Volcker, who served as director of the Federal Reserve from 1979
to 1987, ``brings great experience in the whole area of finance and
general economic matters,'' said James Wolfensohn, the firm's
founder, president and chief executive officer.
   ``He's a great negotiator and will help run client relations and
add to the breadth of the services we bring to our clients,''
Wolfensohn said.
   Wolfensohn said the six-year-old firm specializes in work with
major American and international companies and their strategies in
mergers and acquisitions.
   He said he has known Volcker for at least 10 years.
   Volcker, who graduated from Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of
Public and International Affairs in 1949, is the first to hold the
school's Frederic H. Schultz Class of 1951 Professorship of
International Economic Policy.
   The Princeton post and the position with Wolfensohn are
effective immediately.
   At a news conference Wednesday morning in Princeton, Volcker
said he declined professorship offers from a number of other
universities, including Harvard, from which he received his
master's degree in political economy in 1951.
   ``I had discussions with a number of Ivy League and non-Ivy
League universities,'' he said. ``I think it is fair to say that
there was a certain pull here for my alma mater, though I have a
another alma mater in the Ivy League.
   ``I felt comfortable here. The school combines my interest in
the public service and in economic policy.''
   Volcker said he intends to spend the coming months at Princeton
meeting with graduate students and attending a faculty seminar on
international trade.
   ``I'm delighted to have the opportunity to get the kind of
intellectual stimulus you can get here and I hope to contribute a
little bit,'' he said. ``I'm somewhat intimidated by the fact that
I'm having to go back and do a little teaching. I'm hoping for a
little assistance to help me through those early stages.''
   During the 1988-89 academic year he plans to teach both
semesters at the graduate and undergraduate levels.

<HEAD>Sears Announces Overhaul of Sluggish Merchandising Sector</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. says a three-year overhaul
of its $28 billion retail stores operation will make the nation's
biggest general retailer more responsive to customers and more
profitable for investors.
   Retailing analysts see the shakeup as an attempt to revive
sluggish sales and profits within the company's merchandise group,
which saw its share of Sears' total revenue slip to about 58
percent in 1987 from more than 65 percent in 1985.
   ``Basically what we find today is a Sears company not as strong
as it was last year,'' analyst Allan Bortel, a senior vice
president for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said Wednesday.
   Sears says its planned new retailing structure would improve its
competitiveness, which in turn would better serve its customers and
shareholders.
   ``If we have a leaner management organization, because we will
be that much more competitive, we will be delivering greater
revenues and greater income to the bottom line,'' said company
spokesman Philo Holland after Sears announced the restructuring
Wednesday.
   The restructuring, which will trim an undetermined number of
people from the merchandise group's management staff of about
4,000, is aimed at making each department of every Sears store more
competitive, officials said.
   The plan calls for each department, from womens apparel to lawn
and garden supplies, to be reorganized under its own, unique
management structure.
   ``The apparel business will be run differently from the hardware
business,'' Holland said. ``You need different organizational
structures to compete in different businesses.''
   Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive officer of the
merchandising group, stated that the restructuring would reduce the
number of management levels, making each segment of Sears'
merchandise business leaner and more independent.
   ``We are competing in many diverse businesses, each with its own
unique structure, and (we) have been essentially using one
organizational format to compete in all of these businesses,''
Bozic said.
   ``The changes we make will result in a company that is better
structured to maintain its position as America's premier
retailer,'' he said.
   Officials said they had no estimate of the number of employees
to be affected or the cost savings involved.
   ``The ultimate size and structure will be determined by how we
choose to compete in the different businesses we are
restructuring,'' Holland said.
   He said the reduction in management personnel would be achieved
through attrition, severance bonuses and early retirement offers.
   Bortel said he didn't expect massive layoffs or sales of valued
assets in the near future.
   ``Sears is a very conservative company and does not do anything
in a radical way,'' Bortel said in a telephone interview from San
Francisco.

   The yearlong study released Wednesday said the improved

provisions that allow the agency to write off some of the debt so
that families can stay on the land, officials say.
   Joe O'Neill, an FmHA spokesman, said Wednesday the new rules
probably will be ready by June. In many cases, over-burdened

<HEAD>Big Increase in Export Sales of American Wine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soaring sales to Japan and Britain helped
send total U.S. wine exports in 1987 to 11.87 million gallons, a 64
percent increase over the previous year, a trade group reported.
   The dollar's decline against foreign currencies, including a 55
percent drop against the Japanese yen over the past two years, was
largely the cause, the Wine Institute said Wednesday.
   U.S. wineries also have begun more aggressive promotions to
overseas markets, said Sam Folsom, a spokesman for the San
Francisco-based institute.
   Overall, U.S. exports totaled $60.8 million in 1987, up from
$34.8 million the year before. Calfornia wines account for about 95
percent of American wine exports.
   Exports account for only 3 percent of all California wine
shipments, but the sales are considered important because domestic
sales have been less than dynamic in recent years, according to
wine experts.
   Japan is one of the fastest growing markets.
   ``There's a growing awareness of Califoria wines, particularly
among Japanese yuppies,'' said wine consultant Jon Fredriskson.
   Japan was the largest export market in terms of dollars,
importing $14 million worth of American wine, or 2.25 million
gallons, up from $7.3 million worth in 1986.
   Canada imported $10.9 million, but in greater bulk. Its imports
reached 3.3 million gallons, up from 2.6 million in 1986. In terms
of gallons, it was the largest importer of American wine.

<HEAD>Aspirin Ad Claims Restricted by FDA</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 1-6 grafs on Young comments today. Picks up 3rd

<TEXT>
   The head of the Food and Drug
Administration said today the agency hopes to make a decision in a
few months on whether aspirin manfacturers can advertise claims
that their products help reduce a first heart attack.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said he was pleased with a
voluntary agreement from the nation's aspirin manufacturers
Wednesday not to make such claims until data from a recent study
can be fully analyzed.
   Young, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' said
people with high blood pressure, liver disease, gout or ulcers face
the risk of bleeding complications from aspirin and should seek the
advice of a doctor on its usage.
   He also said that while there is some evidence that healthy men
between the ages of 45 and 85 might use an aspirin every other day
to reduce the risk of heart attack, there is no evidence that it
would help women or younger men.
   ``We didn't want to see people get hurt. We felt it important to
get the facts in...'' Young said. ``We hope to make our decision
within a few months.''
   Summoned by a letter that reminded them of the FDA's regulatory
power, aspirin manufacturers met for more than an hour on Wednesday
with Young, who then announced the agreement at a news conference.
   Young said the agency was concerned that aspirin ads citing a
recent medical journal study could be misleading.
   ``The manufacturers agreed to exercise voluntary restraint and
refrain from further promotion of the study results until the facts
of the study are known and the necessary analyses were completed
and appropriate physician labeling made available,'' Young
announced in a formal statement.
   Though he called the action ``voluntary'', Young said later on
public television's ``MacNeil-Leher News Hour'' that if the
manufacturers ``go and make a misbranded claim then we could take
action. ... The extreme action is to call the product misbranded
and seize it.''
   The commissioner insisted that the meeting was not called in
response to advertising already run, saying he was ``so busy'' that
he never read, listened or watched advertising.
   Young said the meeting was prompted by publicity surrounding an
aspirin study published Jan. 28 in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   In the study, more than 11,000 physicians over the age of 40
took one aspirin every other day, while another group of physicians
took placebos, or fake aspirin. At the end of 57 months, the study
showed that those taking aspirin had 47 percent fewer heart attacks.
   Young said the study was incomplete and the FDA has not approved
aspirin for use in the prevention of an initial heart attack.
   Until the FDA analyzes the study and formulates formal physician
instructions on the use of aspirin against first heart attacks,
Young said drug companies cannot promote aspirin for this use.
   There are no loopholes in the agreement for ads already
prepared, he said.
   ``From this time forward, any ads in the pipeline will not be
grandfathered (escape enforcement),'' said Young.
   William C. MacLeod, director of consumer protection at the
Federal Trade Commission, which regulates drug advertising, refused
repeatedly at the news conference to say if his agency had taken
any action regarding ads by aspirin manufacturers, nor would he say
that inappropriate ads had been run.
   In a Feb. 24 letter, Young ``invited'' the drug manufacturers to
attend a meeting at his FDA office to discuss the aspirin findings.
He wrote of his concern that ``the dissemination of certain types
of information is clearly premature.''
   The letter also cited the federal law that forbids mislabeling
drugs.
   The agency did not identify the manufacturers attending the
meeting, and most of those leaving the closed-door session refused
to comment. An exception was Dr. Edward Henry of Squibb
Pharmaceutical Products, who would say only: ``We're all in
agreement. It was a very good meeting.''
   Several drug companies have produced ads promoting the use of
aspirin to help prevent a second heart attack. These were based on
a 1985 study that was analyzed by the FDA.
   But the study announced in January was the first to suggest that
aspirin could help prevent a primary, or first, heart attack.
   Young said his concern is that the latest study involved a
narrow group _ all physicians in good health _ and that the aspirin
therapy is not appropriate for everyone, particularly the young. He
said the study showed that aspirin therapy could increase the risk
of stroke.
   The commissioner also said unsupervised aspirin use can cause
intestinal bleeding and aggravate gout, peptic ulcer, and kidney
and liver disease.
   ``To take it willy-nilly every other day, particularly if you
are a young man or woman, you are more apt to have a stroke or
suffer from a bleeding ulcer,'' he said.
   Young said it will take about six months for the FDA to analyze
the aspirin study and then publish new labeling rules for the drug.

   President Reagan indicated today he
believes Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega must go, while
Secretary of State George P. Shultz said economic sanctions against
Noriega's government were being ``considered carefully.''
   Reagan, during an unscheduled meeting with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher at the conclusion of the NATO summit,
was asked during a picture-taking session if he thought Noriega
should relinquish power.
   ``Yes,'' the president responded. He did not elaborate.
   During a subsequent photo session with Belgian Prime Minister
Wilfried Martens, Reagan was asked if the United States was ready
to seize Panamanian assets in American banks.
   ``I can't give you an answer yet,'' he replied. ``We still have
a lot of talking to do.''
   Reagan last Friday said he had no plans to intervene militarily
in Panama and said he thought the American options were limited in
the area.
   Shultz called Noriega ``bad news'' but said that no decision had
been made on sanctions.
   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams had raised the
prospect in Washington on Wednesday that the next payment due to
Panama for Panama Canal operations would be withheld if such a
request were made by ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said that the
request already had been received.
   At a news conference today in Brussels following the conclusion
of the NATO summit, Shultz told reporters, ``Noriega is bad news
for Panama, he's bad news for the region.''
   He said there were a ``variety of things'' the United States
could do, including restricting the flow of money into the
Panamanian treasury. ``That is being considered carefully,'' he
said. ``We want to do it properly, we want to do it right, we want
to do it effectively.''
   In Washington, Abrams said the administration would respond to a
request by Delvalle to withhold the canal payments.
   ``If he tells us he doesn't want that money going to Noriega,
then we're not going to give it to Noriega.''
   Panama receives a reported $80 million in canal-related fees
annually. Four members of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee demanded Wednesday that the administration halt all such
payments to Panama.
   The United States continues to regard Delvalle as Panama's
constitutional president and seeks the removal of Noriega, under
federal indictment on drug smuggling charges, from the nation's
political life.
   Delvalle was ousted last week after attempting to fire Noriega
and has been in hiding in Panama since then.
   At stake is a $7 million U.S. payment due March 15 for canal
tolls, fees and services. Much more is involved in what appears to
be a parallel U.S. effort to keep the new Panamanian government
from gaining access to official accounts in U.S. banks.
   William D. Rogers, of the Arnold & Porter law firm in
Washington, said the administration was taking legal steps to
ensure that the banks may make disbursements only to the Panamanian
ambassador who served under Delvalle, Juan B. Sosa.
   Rogers, who represents Delvalle and his allies here, said the
State Department was issuing ``formal certifications'' that it
regards Sosa as ``the accredited representative of the recognized
government of the country.''
   At the State Department, Ms. Oakley said only that such
certifications were being prepared. She declined to specify their
purpose.
   Asked about the U.S. position on that issue, Abrams told the
Cable News Network: ``We know who the legitimate government of
Panama is. If the government of President Delvalle says to American
banks, `Don't pay money to Noriega,' then all those banks are going
to come to the State Department and say, `Who's got the authority
here? Noriega or Delvalle?'
   ``We're going to answer that question. Delvalle is president of
Panama. And Noriega has been fired and he does not have legitimate
authority here.''
   Sosa estimated that U.S. bank deposits of the Panamanian
government total $50 million.
   Rogers seemed confident that the U.S. government action would
preclude any Panamanian government withdrawals from U.S. accounts,
but neither Abrams nor Ms. Oakley offered confirmation of that
claim.
   Also on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Lloyd F. McMahon in
Manhattan issued a temporary restraining order blocking Republic
National Bank from turning millions of dollars over to the new
government.
   The Noriega opponents dropped the suit afterward when the bank
agreed to transfer the funds to the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York.
   Rogers said the settlement does not affect four other banks
being sued: Marine Midland NA, Irving Trust Co., Bankers Trust Co.
in New York, and the Bank of Boston in that city.
   ``The point is not to get money but to deny money to Noriega,''
he said.

   The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration and Volkswagen appear to be working together to keep
the public from learning if sudden acceleration is still a problem
in Audi 5000 cars, a congressman says.
   NHTSA, which last year ordered a massive recall of the vehicles
for installation of a device to fix alleged throttle problems, has
failed to press Volkswagen of America Inc. to place post-recall
reports of sudden acceleration on the public record, Rep. George
Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., said Wednesday.
   In a letter to NHTSA Administrator Diane Steed, Hochbrueckner
said he was ``disturbed by evidence ... which suggests that NHTSA
willingly acquiesced to (Volkswagen's) refusal to turn over the
incident reports.''
   He demanded that Volkswagen turn over all documents relating to
post-recall reports of sudden acceleration to Congress, rather than
to the agency responsible for investigating the complaints.
   Congress has no power to compel the documents be turned over to
it, said Andy Kennedy, an aide to Hochbrueckner.
   NHTSA is auditing its January 1987 recall of 255,336 1978-86
Audi 5000s for installation of the throttle device. The agency has
received 1,750 complaints of sudden acceleration in Audi 5000s,
resulting in 1,269 accidents, 430 injuries and five deaths.
   A NHTSA memorandum by Wolfgang Reinhart, dated last January,
said the agency asked VW for the documents in June 1987, but they
were not included in the automaker's response in July.
   The documents were made available by Volkswagen for inspection
in its Washington office rather than being delivered to NHTSA, the
memo said. ``The source documents were reviewed by (NHTSA)
personnel and the summaries were found to be accurate summations of
the very bulky source documents,'' it said.
   Volkswagen late Wednesday issued a statement in response saying
that ``NHTSA has not given us any special concessions, neither have
we been relieved of any of the burden of responding to the
agencies' requests for information.''
   The automaker said the summaries were an interim report. ``At no
time was it suggested that this status update would take the place
of the technical data required by NHTSA, or that we had refused to
provide NHTSA with this data, or that we would permanently retain
the data in our possession,'' Volkswagen said.
   A NHTSA spokesman said there had been other instances in which
NHTSA had requested summaries of complaints rather than the
complaints themselves. He was unable to say how common the practice
was.
   He declined to comment specifically on Hochbrueckner's
allegations. The spokesman demanded anonymity, citing agency
policy.

   The stock market edged upward today, struggling
to extend its late-winter rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .66 to 2,071.95 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 539 up, 469 down and
498 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.36 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market faced continuing selling from investors
cashing in profits from the market's recent rally or just feeling
skeptical about its chances to go much further.
   But they also noted that many market participants have been
impressed by stocks' ability to absorb that selling without
retreating much from the early-1988 highs they reached early this
week.
   Optimists who believe the economy can escape a recession despite
the market crash last October may get some further support for
their hopes when the Labor Department issues its monthly report
Friday on the employment situation.
   Some advance estimates call for the figures to show a healthy
increase in payroll employment of 150,000 or more for February.
   Koppers Co. jumped 6[ to 51\. An investment group including the
Wall Street firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. began a $45-a-share
offer for the company, and traders quickly concluded that a higher
bid or bids might be in the offing.
   Home Depot rose 1\ to 24]. The stock was added to Standard &
Poor's 500-stock composite index, prompting buying by index funds
set up to track the performance of the 500.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks crept
ahead .02 to 150.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .74 at 291.66.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average eked out a .83
gain to 2,071.29.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 908 up, 560 down and 500 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 199.63 million shares, against 199.99 million in the
previous session.

   Republic National Bank of New York has agreed to
transfer millions of dollars in Panamanian funds to the Federal
Reserve Bank and in return, foes of Panama's dictatorship have
dropped a lawsuit against the bank.
   The settlement was announced Wednesday evening, hours after a
federal judge signed an order barring Republic National from
releasing the contested funds to the regime of military strongman
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The judge's action came at the request of Panamanian President
Eric Arturo Delvalle, ousted last week following his unsuccessful
attempt to fire Noriega but still recognized by the U.S. government
as the legitimate head of Panama.
   The suit appeared to be part of a coordinated effort to deny
money to Noriega's cash-strapped regime, which already has been cut
off from U.S. aid. The State Department also has asked a group of
banks not to disburse Panamanian government funds to Noriega.
   Filed on behalf of the Republic of Panama at Manhattan federal
court, the suit asserted a ``massive transfer of funds'' to Noriega
had already occurred and up to $10 million more would be
transferred unless the court stopped it.
   But late in the day, the bank said the lawsuit ``has been
voluntarily dismissed and Republic National Bank of New York has
transferred to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, any funds held
by it of Banco Nacional de Panama.''
   William D. Rogers, attorney for the Noriega opponents who
brought the lawsuit, confirmed the settlement in a telephone
interview from his Washington office. But Rogers said he didn't
know much much money had been transferred to the Federal Reserve
Bank for safekeeping.
   ``The point is not to get money but to deny money to Noreiga,''
said Rogers, adding that the settlement doesn't affect similar
lawsuits against three other New York banks: Bankers Trust, Irving
Trust and Marine Midland.
   Those banks were included after the original lawsuit was filed
but were not immediately included in U.S. District Judge Lloyd F.
MacMahon's temporary restraining order which had been signed
earlier in the day.
   Noriega, military leader of Panama, was indicted on drug charges
by two U.S. grand juries in Florida Feb. 4. Delvalle sought to
dismiss Noriega Feb. 25 but was ousted by Noriega supporters and
has gone into hiding.
   On Tuesday, Delvalle took steps through his supporters to freeze
Panamanian assets outside the country.
   Panama's U.S. ambassador, Juan B. Sosa, who has maintained that
Delvalle's ouster was unconstitutional, said he had no precise
figures on the amount of money in Panamanian accounts but estimated
it to be $50 million.
   According to court papers, Sosa told all four banks by telex
Tuesday that only he was authorized to approve transfer of money
from the Panamanian accounts.

<HEAD>Newtown Firm To Offer Expensive Modular Homes</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWTOWN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A pair of Connecticut entrepreneurs have
in hand the blueprints they think will alter the popular image of
modular homes as boxy structures that sway in the breeze.
   Harvey F. Gerber Jr. and his wife, Wendy A. Horgan, have formed
a company that will sell modular houses designed by an architect to
look like and compete with the best custom-built homes.
   It's a new market with few competitors.
   The incentive to homebuyers is that so-called ``high-end modular
homes'' can be built at a lower cost and much faster than
comparable stick-built homes that are constructed from the ground
up, Gerber said.
   The four styles offered by Gerber Builders Inc. are two-story
homes, with large porches, 9-foot ceilings, family rooms, multiple
bathrooms and at least three bedrooms. The houses also allow for
personalized touches, such as a choice of flooring, siding and trim
molding.
   The price ranges from about $70,000 to $130,000 for a
2,000-square-foot house, depending upon whether a buyer purchases
an unfinished model or a completed home. The price of land isn't
included.
   ``What we have here is a product that is aimed at a high-end
market. It is going to be indistinguishable from the best
stick-built homes,'' Gerber said during a recent interview.
   Gerber, 39, and his wife are both former Wall Street attorneys.
They got their start in construction 10 years ago when they began
renovating historic buildings in New York City. They had branched
out into condominium construction in New Jersey when they decided
to focus on modular homes.
   They chose Connecticut because of their connections to the
state. Ms. Horgan, originally from New Canaan, received her
master's and law degrees from the University of Connecticut. Gerber
attended Yale and got his law degree from Fordham University.
   The company has constructed a Victorian-style model on its
11-acre headquarters site in Newtown, an affluent suburban
community about 70 miles north of New York City. The firm is
constructing three other models on a parcel in Sussex County, N.J.
   The completion of the model was the culmination of three years
of design work and planning that has cost the company about $1
million, Gerber said.
   The company's goal is to sell at least 100 homes the first year
and begin construction of Connecticut's first modular home factory
at the Newtown site.
   If all goes well, ground could be broken on the proposed
57,000-square-foot factory this summer. The factory would produce
300 homes a year and the product line would be expanded to include
lower-priced and more expensive models along with the
intermediate-priced models now being offered.
   The Gerber homes currently are constructed by Contempri Homes in
Taylor, Pa., and shipped to Connecticut. All the Gerber homes have
been designed by Deborah Berke, who teaches architecture at Yale
University and runs a business in New York City.
   Modular homes account for about 5 percent of all housing starts
nationwide, and perhaps 15 percent of new houses in the Northeast,
where most modular home factories are located, said Barbara Martin,
special projects consultant for the Buildings Systems Council of
the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, D.C.
   She could name only three companies selling high-end modular
homes.
   George Oswald of Techno Craft Inc., another modular home
company, predicts that 50 percent of the housing starts in the
Northeast will be modular homes by the year 2000.
   Techno Craft, which opened a 100,000-square-foot factory in
McElhattan, Pa., last year, already has about $80 million in orders
for its luxury homes.
   ``We're the ones who broke the sound barrier by going into the
high-end (modular home) market,'' Oswald said.
   The smallest Techno-Craft home is 2,600 square feet, with its
colonial mansion models ranging up to 7,000 square feet, Oswald
said. The cost averages about $50 a square foot. The homes are sold
finished and are available only through developers.
   Gerber plans to sell to individual home buyers and small
contractors.
   His current models cost about $65 a square foot completed, or
about $130,000. It would take a crew several days to assemble the
six pieces of each model and then about three more months to
complete the home, Gerber said.
   To those wanting to save money, the company will sell unfinished
homes for about $35 a square foot, or about $70,000. For that
price, the home comes with much of the work done, such as all the
plumbing and electrical wiring run, and the insulation and
wallboard installed. But an unfinished house has no roof, no
siding, and the plumbing and wiring need to be hooked up.
   The company also will sell kits to those more than 30 miles away
from its Newtown office.
   ``We've gotten universal praise from every bank, appraiser,
engineer, contractor and prospect who has visited the house (in
Newtown) prior to its formal opening,'' said Gerber. ``At the same
time, we haven't had the ultimate test, which is market exposure.
We can't conclusively say we've designed a Hula Hoop, although
that's what we believe.''

<HEAD>De Benedetti Must Name Allies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti
must identify his allies before government regulators will allow an
extension of his offer for Societe Generale de Belgiqe S.A,
Belgium's biggest holding company, a banking commission official
said Thursday.
   The official, who asked not to be named, said the French
investment firm Cerus S.A, through which De Benedetti has sought
control of Societe Generale, had asked to extend its offer beyond
Friday's original deadline.
   But the banking commission demanded that Cerus names all its
allies, specifying how many shares of Societe Generale each owns,
by Friday night before approving the request, the official said.
   Cerus itself has a 18.6 percent stake in Societe Generale. But
De Benedetti claims he and his allies control 47.2 percent of the
company's 28.2 million shares.
   A rival alliance centered around the French investment Cie
Financiere de Suez and Belgium's biggest insurer, Groupe AG, says
it has a majority stake of 52 percent.
   Both sides have voiced doubts on the claims of their opponents,
and have each laid claim to the company's proposed capital increase
of 12 million shares, which was approved by a Brussels court
Tuesday.
   The ruling, however, is subject to confirmation by by a higher
court.
   De Benedetti wants to turn the 166-year-old Societe Generale
into a holding company with interests across Europe and wants to
run the day-to-day affairs.
   The rival alliance wants to keep Societe Generale anchored in
Belgium.
   The company has interests in about half of Belgium's 50 biggest
companies and has an important stake in the country's gas,
electricity and petroleum sector and Belgium's largest bank.

   Xerox Corp. said Thursday it would redeem $365
million in preferred shares issued in 1983 to help finance its
acquisition of Crum and Forster Inc., a property and casualty
insurance company based in Morristown, N.J.
   Xerox said it would pay $52.72{ each for 6.94 million preferred
shares that pay an annual dividend of $5.45. Holders of the other
1.9 million shares of the preferred issue previously agreed to
exchange their shares for a new issue of preferred stock.
   Xerox, based in Stamford, Conn., said it financed the redemption
with money from a variety of sources, including two new series of
preferred stock issued in February and the ongoing sale of common
stock through a dividend reinvestment program.

   The stock market showed some scattered losses
today, having trouble extending its late-winter rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.46 to 2,063.83
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 604 up, 607 down and 502
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 75.20 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said the market faced continuing selling from investors
cashing in profits from the market's recent rally or just feeling
skeptical about its chances to go much further.
   But they also noted that many market participants have been
impressed by stocks' ability to absorb that selling without
retreating much from the early-1988 highs they reached early this
week.
   Optimists who believe the economy can escape a recession despite
the market crash last October may get some further support for
their hopes when the Labor Department issues its monthly report
Friday on the employment situation.
   Some advance estimates call for the figures to show a healthy
increase in payroll employment of 150,000 or more for February.
   Koppers Co. jumped 6| to 51}. An investment group including the
Wall Street firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. began a $45-a-share
offer for the company, and traders quickly concluded that a higher
bid or bids might be in the offing.
   Home Depot rose 1{ to 24|. The stock was added to Standard &
Poor's 500-stock composite index, prompting buying by index funds
set up to track the performance of the 500.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .30 to 150.38. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .67 at 291.59.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in light follow-through selling
from Wednesday's weaker close, analysts said.
   The wheat market continued to show nervousness about the
Agriculture Department's new series of surplus wheat auctions, said
Joel Karlin, an analyst for Research Department Inc.
   The USDA sold 10 million bushels of surplus wheat on Tuesday,
held another auction for 10 million bushels Wednesday and has
scheduled a third auction for Friday, also with a target of 10
million bushels.
   Karlin said wheat traders also were jittery about the dim
prospects for new export sales in the near future.
   Soybean futures prices weakened as soybean harvesting got under
way in South America. A record soybean yield is expected in Brazil.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.05{ a bushel; corn was \ cent
to 1 cent lower with March at $2.01 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to
2{ cents lower with March at $1.91 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent
to 3 cents lower with March at $6.28{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .40 cent to 1.07 cent lower with April at 71.05
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to .95 cent lower with
March at 79.62 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .60 cent lower
with April at 42.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .25
cent lower to .03 cent higher with March at 52.15 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Britain Fighting Shortage of Auto Engineers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. auto industry may be trimming back on
engineers, but the British auto industry is going out of its way to
find more.
   The problem is the long, steady decline of auto manufacturing in
the 1960s and 1970s, when young engineers looking for interesting,
better paying jobs entered other fields.
   Now that automaking in Britain is on the rebound, the country's
Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders has mounted a large-scale
effort to restore pride in its car industry, said Godfrey Messervy,
the society's president.
   Messervy, in town for the Society of Automotive Engineers annual
convention, said Britain is suffering from a shortage of engineers
even though it is home to leading-edge innovators such as Lotus
Engineering.
   ``There's a tendency for them not to go into the motor
industry,'' Messervy said.
   Sales have begun to recover along with pay scales, he said, and
makers have been improving efficiency and winning back sales in an
import-dominated market.
   Car sales in 1987 were a record of more than 2 million in the
United Kingdom, and the share of the market held by British-built
car rose to 48.3 percent from 44 percent in 1986.
   But the nation doesn't seem aware that it again is growing a
strong auto industry and Messervy's society wants to change that.
   Targeting schools, it is trying to convince parents and students
that the auto industry is a good field for engineers and offering
school career counselors 12-week introductions to the industry,
sometimes with full pay.
   The society also is lobbying the government to repeal a 10
percent tax on car sales that doesn't apply to other consumer
goods. In a nation with the lowest per-capita car ownership rate in
Western Europe, Messervy said repeal of the tax would boost car
sales by 200,000 a year.

<HEAD>British-led Investment Group Offers $1.3 Billion for Koppers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group led by Beazer PLC and
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. launched a tender offer today of nearly
$1.3 billion for Koppers Co. Inc., a construction and chemicals
company.
   Koppers, which is based in Pittsburgh, had no comment on the
offer, which was initially disclosed in an advertisement in today's
edition of the Wall Street Journal. The offer expires March 30.
   Beazer is a general construction company based in London and
Shearson is a New York-based investment banking firm.
   The offer of $45 a share is being made by BNS Inc., a company
that is reportedly 49 percent owned by Beazer and 45 percent by
Shearson. The remainder is held by County NatWest International
Inc., a British investment bank.
   The bid triggered speculation on Wall Street that a higher offer
might arise. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Koppers
stock jumped $6.37{ a share to $51.50 by midday.
   The bid is conditioned on, among other things, tender of a
majority of Koppers' common shares, approval by the non-managment
directors of Koppers, approval by Beazer's shareholders and the
bidding group's satisfaction that certain elements of Delaware
antitakeover laws are invalid.
   In a letter released in London, Brian C. Beazer, chairman and
chief executive of Beazer PLC, told Charles R. Pullin, Koppers'
chairman and chief executive, that the proposed transaction
``offers excellent opportunity for people connected with Koppers.''
   He wrote that Koppers would become ``part of a worldwide
organization with the extensive resorces, depth of expertise and
financial strength.''
   Beazer said it planned to operate Koppers as an independent
autonomous business and that there were no plans to move its
headquarters from Pittsburgh.
   It said affiliates of BNS currently own 2.1 million Kopper
shares, or about 7.45 percent of Koppers' outstanding common stock.
   Robert O'Gara, a spokesman for Koppers, said the company had no
comment on the offer and refused to comment on whether Koppers'
board planned to meet to discuss it.
   He said Koppers had nearly 28.6 million common shares at the end
of 1987, which would make the value of the tender offer about $1.29
billion.
   Koppers' main businesses are construction materials and
services, which mainly involve road construction, and chemical and
allied products.
   Koppers reported its profit for 1987 fell to $10.2 million, or
36 cents share, from $74.1 million, or $2.59 a share, a year
earlier. The results included a charge of $59.4 million in 1987 due
to settlement of a lawsuit.
   Revenue for 1987 rose to $1.52 billion from $1.4 billion a year
earlier.
   Beazer said it earned $82.8 million on sales of $1.7 billion in
its latest fiscal year ended June 30, 1987.
   Beazer already has interests in the United States. It bought
Gifford-Hill & Co., a cement-maker based in Dallas, in 1986.

   The U.S. dollar rose Thursday against most major
currencies in light European trading. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said they expected the dollar would
trade within a narrow range until the March 17 release of the
latest U.S. merchandise trade figures.
   One senior U.S. bank dealer in Frankfurt said Friday would not
see much traditional pre-weekend position-squaring because few

   In London, the British pound stood at $1.7680, unchanged from

   Gold bullion was lower in London at $427.80 bid a troy ounce,
compared with $429.50 late Wednesday. In Zurich, it also fell to

   In Hong Kong, gold fell to a closing bid of $433.96, down from
$434.95 bid late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $6.22 dollars a
troy ounce, down from $6.24 dollars bid late Wednesday.

<HEAD>For American Economist Diplomacy and Economics Go Hand In Hand</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Brusca turns 38 on March 14.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   As a top economist for Nikko Securities Ltd.,
one of Japan's largest brokerage firms, Robert A. Brusca has had to
do more than just showcase his abilities for forecasting U.S.
economic growth or the trade gap. For one thing, he's had to
develop a taste for green tea.
   ``After about the seventh cup in one day I've had just about all
the green tea I care to have,'' said the 37-year-old Brusca, chief
economist in the fixed-income division of Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc., a Nikko subsidiary.
   Since joining Nikko about two years ago and becoming the first
American to be named a chief economist in that company, Brusca has
learned that foreign diplomacy and economics often go hand in hand
_ and that having a sense of humor helps puts the two in harmony.
   His job is to keep Nikko clients in Japan and elsewhere abreast
of U.S. economic conditions and to advise them on investments,
particularly in the area of government bonds.
   But trying to predict the ups and downs of interest rates can
sometimes be as difficult as learning the proper way to bow in
Japan; to exchange meishis, or business cards; or to drink green
tea, Japan's counterpart to coffee.
   In Japan, ``Everything is proper. The business meetings are very
formal. People are very polite,'' said Brusca, an affable man with
thin brown hair and glasses. His wife, Candace, is an aspiring
actress.
   ``When you arrive at a meeting, you're introduced formally.
You're seated in an office or a meeting room with tea tables and
overstuffed chairs.
   ``Then you exchange business cards. They're always handled with
two hands, and once they're exchanged you leave them directly in
front of you. Each person takes turns to talk. It's considered rude
to interrupt.''
   Despite the formality, the wry humor that has become Brusca's
trademark in the financial world still manages to find a frequent
outlet.
   ``I was talking with two Japanese executives who had been
working together for 15 years,'' he recalled. ``The conversation
turned to first names and it came out that those two didn't know
each other's first name.
   ``I said, `Everyone has the same first name (in Japan) _
Mister.'''
   The two stoic men managed to crack a smile, Brusca noted with
pride.
   His weekly reports to clients on the state of the world's
economy can be equally amusing. One dated Jan. 29, for instance,
used the comic book characters Batman and Robin in describing how
economic strength in the fourth quarter was likely to give way to
weakness through 1988.
   ``One of their favorite tricks was to turn their car sharply
while moving at high speed so that it would skid backwards while
going in the same direction until traction overtook inertia and
they were able to reverse direction. The U.S. economy is
experiencing a bat turn of sorts ...''
   And then there was the report two weeks earlier that focused on
West Germany's reluctance to stimulate its economy to help improve
its trade imbalance with the United States.
   ``I want to draw the distinction between being thoughtless and
being mindless,'' he wrote. ``Thoughtlessness implies an ability
... to be more considerate of the needs of others. Mindlessness
implies an inability to think clearly about anything ...
   ``From my perch overseas their (West Germany's) policies look
mindless, but possibly they are merely thoughtless.''
   Brusca says those offbeat analogies are often deleted when
translated from English to Japanese.
   ``The people who read the Japanese (version) have no idea I have
a sense of humor,'' he said. ``And sometimes the people who read
the English version have no idea I have a sense of humor.''
   It's his unflinching wit, though, that helps get the Detroit
native quoted in business publications and on televised financial
news shows. He also writes a regular column in ``Financial World''
and is a contributor to Nikkei Financial Daily.
   When asked nine days after the Oct. 19 stock market collapse how
Wall Street planned to commemorate the Crash of 1929, he quickly
responded, ``with paper hats and paper losses.''
   But Brusca warns: ``Don't mistake that I'm not serious. I'm very
serious about what I do. But the use of humor helps. It's a very
high-pressure job. You can be ungodly serious or you can stay
loose.''
   Advising investors about how and when to spend their hard-earned
money is a tough business, and Nikko didn't hire Brusca just for
his good humor.
   Large Japanese securities firms have gone out of their way in
the past few years to hire experienced Americans to act as teachers
of sorts in helping ``Westernize'' their foreign employers, Brusca
said.
   Before Nikko, he worked as a money market economist and
``Fedwatcher'' at Irving Trust Co. in New York. He also was a
senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he
analyzed international banking activity.
   Brusca also holds doctorate and master's degrees from Michigan
State University.

   The stock market hovered in a narrow range
today, having trouble extending its late-winter rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.81 to 2,065.48
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 738 up, 691 down and 479
unchanged.
   Analysts said the market faced continuing selling from investors
cashing in profits from the market's recent rally or just feeling
skeptical about its chances to go much further.
   But they also noted that many market participants have been
impressed by stocks' ability to absorb that selling without
retreating much from the early-1988 highs they reached early this
week.
   Optimists who believe the economy can escape a recession despite
the market crash last October may get some further support for
their hopes when the Labor Department issues its monthly report
Friday on the employment situation.
   Some advance estimates call for the figures to show a healthy
increase in payroll employment of 150,000 or more for February.
   Koppers Co. jumped 6| to 51}. An investment group including the
Wall Street firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. began a $45-a-share
offer for the company, and traders quickly concluded that a higher
bid or bids might be in the offing.
   Takeover rumors and speculation swirled around such other stocks
as Texas Eastern, up 2} at 32, and Firestone Tire & Rubber, up 3[
at 49}.
   Home Depot rose 1{ to 24|. The stock was added to Standard &
Poor's 500-stock composite index, prompting buying by index funds
set up to track the performance of the 500.
   Airline stocks were broadly higher, aided by signs of easing
fare competition. Delta Air Lines gained ~ to 48~; AMR 1~ to 41~;
NWA 1\ to 44~, and Allegis 1[ to 76~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .16 to 150.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.01 at 291.93.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 152.07 million shares with two
hours to go.

   Publicity about AIDS has reduced sales of
the diet candy Ayds by up to a half, so the manufacturer is looking
for a new name to beef up its image, the chairman said Thursday.
   The diet suppressant has been on the market for 47 years and
remains a profitable product for the Dep Corp., but sales have
dropped by as much as 50 percent over the past few years because of
the name association, company Chairman Robert Berglass said.
   ``You cannot specifically blame the disease on our product in
any way, shape or form. We think it is a negative association and
it would be best not to have it associated in any way,'' Berglass
said in a telephone interview from Dep's headquarters, 15 miles
south of downtown Los Angeles.
   ``Johnson and Johnson does not have a problem with Band-Aid
because it has the name couched within what the product is,'' he
said.
   ``I am sure that if you want to do a study, there are a lot of
names out there with AIDS in it, Band-Aid, Cur-Aid,'' Berglass
said. ``Our problem is that our name is just that one word.''
   Since January, Ayds has been marketed in Great Britain under the
new name Aydslim. If sales show signs of recovery, the appetite
suppressant candy may be sold in the United States under that name
later this year.
   So far, reaction from retailers has been positive, Berglass
said. But consumer reaction has yet to be determined, he said.
   He expects consumer reaction to be available within the next few
months. Most people go on diets in the spring, as they think about
summer swim suits, he explained.
   Until the name question is answered, Dep, which also makes
Lavoris mouthwash and Topol smoker's toothpaste, has a
``frustrating marketing problem,'' he said.
   ``You cannot use the radio and television media to advertise.
You are confined to print in reaching the consumer. People are not
going to listen to your message when they hear it on a verbal
basis. They have to see it. That's why our campaign for the spring
will be in print.''
   Industry analysts disagree over the value of a name change.
   ``I think it's a dumb move,'' said Charles E. Brymer, president
of the New York-based product-naming firm, Interbrand USA.
   ``They should just walk away from the name Ayds and relaunch it
under a new name,'' Brymer said. ``The whole AIDS issue has become
so large that I would not want to market anything under that name.''
   ``If you change the name, you give up the equity,'' said Ira
Bachrach, president of San Francisco-based NameLab Inc. ``Besides,
the problem with the name is more in the mind of the media than the
consumer.''
   Federal health officials believe about 40,000 Americans have
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. By 1991, that figure is
expected to top 270,000.

   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange has raised the
margin requirements on its stock-index futures by 2 percentage
points in response to a call for better coordination of the
country's financial markets, officials said Thursday.
   The change, approved Wednesday by the exchange's board of
governors, requires traders of the Merc's Standard & Poor's 500
stock-index futures to post payments equal to 15 percent of the
value of the contracts being traded, instead of 13 percent as
previously.
   A presidential commission that investigated the October stock
market collapse suggested raising margins on stock-index futures as
a way of curbing swings in their prices. The wild swings have been
blamed for adding to volatility in the stock market.
   The presidential commission, headed by New York investment
banker Nicholas Brady, found that professionals in the stock market
can invest in stocks on a margin of as little as 20 to 25 percent.
It said margins in futures should be ``consistent,'' although not
necessarily equal.
   John F. Sandner, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's
board of governors, said in a statement that ``maintaining
stock-index futures margin at the 15 percent level will bring the
`consistency' sought by the Brady Commission.''
   David Ruder, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
has suggested margins of 20 percent to 25 percent on index futures.
   But Wendy Lee Gramm, the new head of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, which regulates futures markets, said Wednesday
she saw no need for higher margins on stock-index futures.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is the nation's largest market
for stock-index futures, accounting for more than 80 percent of all
contracts traded.
   Stock-index futures are traded by investors who use them to
hedge against losses in the stock market as well as speculators who
hope to profit by guessing on the direction of the market.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc. said Thursday it will
sell a computer for artificial-intelligence work based on Apple
Computer Inc.'s Macintosh II, a step that should move ``thinking
machines'' more into the mainstream of business.
   Texas Instruments said the new Micro Explorer would have all the
functions of a standard Macintosh II as well as
artificial-intelligence features, such as the ability to manipulate
symbols instead of just numbers.
   Most other artificial-intelligence (AI) workstations, including
Texas Instruments' own Explorer, cannot be used as general-purpose
computers.
   Other AI companies are also moving to insert their technology
into existing computers, including Texas Instruments' biggest rival
in the field, Symbolics Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.
   However, Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple said it will have an
especially close relationship with Dallas-based Texas Instruments.
In a first for both companies, Texas Instruments and Apple will
both put their logos on the Micro Explorer, which will be marketed
only by Texas Instruments.
   Texas Instruments and Apple said the Micro Explorer could be
used in such varied fields as tax advising, computer-aided design
and assigning gates to airplanes at airports.
   Although artificial intelligence encompasses the whole concept
of making computers think like people, most products on the market
have the more modest goal of augmenting human decision makers by
converting knowledge into a set of rules that can be applied by a
computer.
   The price of the Micro Explorer ranges from about $15,000 to
$30,000, compared to $50,000 to $70,000 for the Explorer, which is
about twice as powerful, Texas Instruments said. An AI package will
also be available for people who already own the Mac II. Shipments
are scheduled to begin in the April-June period.
   Symbolics, in a response to the Texas Instruments announcement,
said its Ivory chip for artificial intelligence is superior to
Texas Instruments' Explorer Lisp chip. It also said its chip will
be plugged into not only the Mac II, but also International
Business Machines Corp.'s Personal System-2 and PC AT, although it
could not give a timetable.
   Texas Instruments said it had no timetable for putting its
artificial-intelligence chip into other personal computers besides
the Mac II.

<HEAD>World's Biggest Oil Company Reports Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Companies reported Thursday that its
profit rose 14 percent in both the fourth quarter and all of 1987,
but the world's largest oil company would have suffered a decrease
for the year under accounting rules used in the United States.
   The Anglo-Dutch oil giant said after-tax earnings for the final
three months of 1987 totaled 858 British pounds, or about $1.5
billion, compared with a profit of 752 pounds a year earlier. It
attributed the improvement to gains in exploration, production and
chemical businesses that offset lower refinery profits.
   Revenue fell 37.6 percent to 1.34 billion pounds from 2.15
billion pounds, a drop attributed largely to asset sales and
movements in net working capital during the year-earlier period,
the company said.
   For the full year, Royal Dutch-Shell said it had an after-tax
profit of 2.88 billion pounds, or about $4.74 billion, compared
with earnings of 2.54 billion pounds in 1986. Revenue decreased
29.3 percent to 5.3 billion pounds from 7.5 billion pounds.
   Royal Dutch-Shell uses an accounting system that values
inventories on a ``first-in, first-out basis,'' as opposed to the
``last-in, first-out'' basis used by most major American oil
companies.
   The company said that if it had used the American accounting
system, its full-year results would have shown a 15 percent decline
in profit _ dropping to 2.86 billion pounds, or about $4.73
billion, from 3.37 billion pounds.
   For the fourth-quarter, however, its profit would have been ever
better under the American rules, showing a 64 percent rise. Its
earnings for the quarter totaled 986 million pounds, or about $1.71
billion, compared with a profit of 600 million pounds a year
earlier.
   With headquarters in London and the Hague, Netherlands, Royal
Dutch-Shell is the largest oil company in the world. It is the
parent of Shell Oil Co., based in Houston.

<TEXT>
   Roxane Laboratories Inc. has recalled six
lot numbers of its Roxanol 100 pain reliever because of a possibly
defective spoon that the company said could result in an overdose
of morphine.
   The recall, announced Wednesday, is for Lots 860503, 860828,
870289, 870521, 870860 and 871027 of Roxanol 100, a liquid form of
morphine sulfate prescribed for the relief of severe pain in
terminally ill cancer patients.
   The company said there is no problem with the drug itself and
that no injuries have been reported to date. The product is
distributed nationwide.
   A similar product called Roxanol, which is dispensed with a
dropper, is not involved in the recall, the company said.
   The company said a defective spoon was discovered in display
samples of Roxanol 100. The defective spoon has a cylindrical tube,
from top to bottom, into which medication is poured for
measurement; the correct spoon has a plug in the tube just below
the 20mg mark, and the lower third of the tube just below the plug
is open on the back side.
   Roxane Laboratories estimated the risk of the defective spoon
appearing in a package of Roxanol 100 at about 1 in 1,000, but
requested that hospitals, pharmacies and wholesalers that have the
lot numbers in question return the packages to Roxane Laboratories
for inspection. The company said replacement stock is available.
   The company also urged pharmacists and other health care
professionals to consult with patients using Roxanol 100 and
determine if any defective spoons are in their possession.
   Patients taking the drug should consult with pharmacists or
other health professionals, the company said. Roxane Laboratories
said it would supply a replacement spoon in cases where spoons are
found to be defective, or that replacements could be supplied by
pharmacists or physicians.

<TEXT>
   Hilton Hotels Corp. said Thursday
it has been approached by a Japanese investor about the possibility
of selling its 22-acre Hilton Hawaiian Village on Waikiki Beach.
   However, the company's chairman and chief executive, Barron
Hilton, denied a report that the investors had offered $1 billion,
noting that price would equate to about $340,000 a room, which is
less than other hotels in Hawaii have fetched.
   He also noted that the company has recently spent $100 million
refurbishing the 2,524-room complex, which is owned jointly with
Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
   Hilton didn't identify the investors, but said that the
overtures were unsolicited and that no formal discussions had been
held.
   ``The hotel is not on the market. We do not feel it is in the
best interest of our company to sell the Village at this time,''
Hilton said.
   His statement did not address a report in the Wall Street
Journal on Thursday that the investors also were interested in
acquiring the company's Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York, and a
company spokesman declined to elaborate.
   Hilton is sole owner of the Waldorf, which also has recently
undergone an expensive refurbishing.
   The Hawaiian Village and Waldorf have turned in especially
strong earnings in recent periods, the company has said.
   Late last year, the company sold the 592-room Beverly Hilton to
entertainer-businessman Merv Griffin for $100.2 million. The
Beverly Hills property also was jointly owned by Hilton and
Prudential.

<NOTE>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund
Report are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 418 money market mutual
funds fell $1.15 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $278.51 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $2.59 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group. That rise, in the week ended Feb. 24, put the
funds' assets at a record high of $280.02 billion.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 208 general purpose funds rose $230.5 million to $81.67
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds dropped $457.8 million to
$115.10 billion, and assets of 113 institutional funds decreased
$1.28 billion to $81.74 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.10 percent from 6.16 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 6.17 percent from 6.23 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
45 days, up from 43 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
5.74 percent as of Wednesday from 5.75 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, were unchanged at 5.17 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 6.85
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 6.88
percent the previous week. Yields were 7.16 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 7.20 percent; 7.57 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.62
percent; and 8.04 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.08 percent.

   Stock prices went their own very different ways
Thursday in an inconclusive session marked by intense takeover
speculation and some selling of blue chips.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 big-name industrials slipped 7.80 to
2,063.49.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 8 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 793 up, 707 down and 454 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 203.31 million shares, against 199.63
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index edged
up .02 at 150.70.
   Analysts said the market faced continuing selling from investors
cashing in profits from the recent rally or just feeling skeptical
about its chances to go much further.
   But they also noted that many market participants have been
impressed by stocks' ability to absorb that selling without
retreating much from the early-1988 highs they reached early this
week.
   Optimists who believe the economy can escape a recession despite
the market crash last October may get some further support for
their hopes when the Labor Department issues its monthly report
Friday on the employment situation.
   Some advance estimates call for the figures to show a healthy
increase in payroll employment of 150,000 or more for February.
   Koppers Co. jumped 6| to 51}. An investment group including the
Wall Street firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. began a $45-a-share
offer for the company, and traders quickly concluded that a higher
bid or bids might be in the offing.
   Takeover rumors and speculation swirled around such other stocks
as Texas Eastern, up 2} at 32, and Firestone Tire & Rubber, up 2~
at 49{.
   Home Depot rose 1\ to 24]. The stock was added to Standard &
Poor's 500-stock composite index, prompting buying by index funds
set up to track the performance of the 500.
   Airline stocks were broadly higher, aided by signs of easing
fare competition. Delta Air Lines gained ~ to 48~; AMR 2[ to 42[;
NWA 1[ to 44}, and Allegis 1\ to 77. The group has also gotten a
lift lately from weakness in oil prices.
   Sears Roebuck, which reported a 2.5 percent gain in retail sales
for February, dropped 1 to 38}. Other losers among the blue chips
included International Business Machines, down } at 116{; Philip
Morris, down 2[ at 93; General Electric, down ] at 44}, and Merck,
down { at 163}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $2.47 billion, or 0.09
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 233.42 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials dropped .26 to
309.34, and S&P's 500-stock composite index was down .10 at 267.88.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.63 to 372.01. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 292.51, up 1.59.

   Worldwide demand for oil may drive
prices up to nearly twice present levels and increase dependence on
Persian Gulf supplies, according to a study by Harvard University
released Wednesday.
   The yearlong study, partially funded by a consortium of Japanese
government and busineses, was conducted by Harvard's Energy and
Environmental Policy Center and entitled ``Lower Oil Prices:
Mapping the Impact.''
   It said the improved economies in industrial nations since oil
prices dropped in 1986 have discouraged conservation efforts and
reduced oil stockpiles.
   ``Today's low prices sow the seeds for higher prices tomorrow by
encouraging use, by improving prospects for economic growth ... and
by lulling consumers, industries and government into energy
security complacency,'' the report stated.
   But the study indicated that lower oil prices have also
triggered a long-term economic growth rate of 2.5 percent annually
in the United States and 3 percent to 4 percent in Japan.
   A Harvard study released in September characterized Reagan
administration energy policies as ``myopic'' for failing to
encourage conservation and bolster domestic oil reserves. The
earlier study also called for a $5-a-barrel oil import tariff to
promote domestic oil production and reduce dependence on Persian
Gulf supplies.
   The latest report predicts oil prices could rise from recent
levels _ between $15 and $20 per 42-gallon barrel _ to more than
$30 a barrel by the early 1990s.
   ``As demand growth resumes, then higher oil prices cannot be far
behind,'' the report stated.
   The study found that while governments have been increasing oil
reserves, including the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, petroleum
companies have reduced stockpiles due to higher demand. The
situation weakens the nation's ability to withstand disruptions in
oil imports, particularly from the Persian Gulf.
   The report was authored by Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani of Apache
International Inc., a Denver-based firm studying international oil
supplies, and Harvard professors William Hogan, Dale Jorgenson and
Richard Cooper.

<HEAD>Senate Bill Bans Most Uses Of Lie Detectors In Private orkplace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lie detectors, likened by one lawmaker to
``20th century witchcraft,'' would be largely banned from use in
job interviews and the private workplace under legislation approved
by the Senate on Thursday.
   On a 69-27 vote, the Senate approved a bill co-written by Sens.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah _ normally
adversaries on labor-management issues _ outlawing about 85 percent
of the current use of polygraph examinations.
   Conservative opponents predicted that President Reagan would
sign the legislation once a final version of the bill has emerged
from a Senate-House conference.
   An estimated 2 million people, most of them jobseekers, are
required to take lie detector tests every year and that number is
growing exponentially, said Kennedy, who chairs the Senate's Labor
and Human Resources Committee.
   Hatch, the committee's ranking Republican, said an overwhelming
majority of the tests are conducted in brief 15-minute sessions and
under conditions that render false results between 15 percent and
50 percent of the time.
   ``I'm sick and tired of the way people are using these
devices,'' he said. ``Some 320,000 honest Americans are branded as
liars every single year. That's a stigma they have to wear every
day the rest of their lives and careers.''
   Similar but more restrictive legislation was approved by the
House 254-158 last November.
   Kennedy said he planned to meet with Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont.,
chief author of the House version, within the next two weeks to
work out a plan for resolving differences between the two versions
in a compromise that could win passage in both houses.
   ``They ban about 90 percent and we ban about 85 percent,'' he
said, predicting the new prohibtion will become law before the end
of the year ``with or without the president's support.''
   Just prior to the vote Thursday, after more than two days of
debate, Senate opponents complained that the administration had
softened its opposition after threatening last year to veto any
polygraph bill.
   ``The administration does not have the backbone at this time to
veto this bill,'' complained Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind. ``They have
folded up shop, caving like a house of cards.''
   Quayle and other opponents said prohibiting the use of lie
detectors will prevent businesses such as restaurants, stores and
trucking companies subject to large losses from thefts from
screening out dishonest workers.
   ``In passing this legislation, we are going to increase costs
for consumers and the cost of doing business in this country,''
said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss.
   Hatch, however, said no one has presented any statistics in
states where use of the test already is prohibited to demonstrate a
higher incidence of theft or embezzlement.
   The legislation has been sought for years by civil liberties
groups and labor unions, who contend that the devices are used to
intimidate workers and weed out union sympathizers among job
applicants.
   ``We applaud the Senate in recognizing that lie detectors can be
used in blatant assaults on a worker's right of privacy,'' AFL-CIO
President Lane Kirkland said after Thursday's vote.
   Kennedy said the polygraph has become ``to the 20th century what
witchcraft was two centuries ago.''
   ``This is going to diminish a lot of the harrassment that is
becoming increasingly evident in workplaces across the country,''
he said. ``These devices are no longer going to scar people in ways
that they and their families can never forget.''
   The Senate measure is less prohibitive than the House version in
that it allows companies to use polygraphs in investigating
incidents of ``economic loss or injury'' but only under strict
regulations to be enforced by the Labor Department.
   The House bill bans all uses of lie detectors in private
industry, including investigations of specific losses, but exempts
private security, armored guard and pharmaceutical companies from
coverage.
   The Senate on Thursday approved an amendment also exempting
security and armored car companies, and Kennedy said Friday that
pharmaceutical houses will likely be exempted in the House-Senate
compromise.
   Hatch said the Senate version allowing continued use of
polygraphs to investigate specific incidents of theft or sabotage
diminished much of the opposition to the bill from various trade
associations. He credited leaders of the 1-million-member United
Food and Commercial Workers Union for working out the deal.
   ``While honest people each year are branded as liars,
conversely, it is a regrettable fact that employees steal,'' he
said. ``This bill addresses both concerns by barring use of
polygraphs where they are most likely to make a false
identification but permitting the use of these tests where they are
likely to be most accurate.''
   Before any test, employers would first have to file a police
report, insurance claim or report to a regulatory agency _ or sign
a statement detailing their reasons for testing a specific worker.
   The tests would have to be administered under strict guidelines,
to be developed by the Labor Department, requiring at least 90
minutes for each exam. Violations could result in fines of up to
$10,000.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mixed against most key
currencies Thursday in apathetic trading that money dealers
attributed to a lack of influential economic news.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold
at $428.20 as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $430.25 late Wednesday.
   ``It was so quiet today,'' said Toshihiko Masaki, a foreign
exchange trader at the New York branch of Japan's Sanwa Bank. ``The
market is waiting for the next trade figures.''
   The Commerce Department is scheduled to report the January
merchandise trade deficit and the fourth-quarter on March 17. The
deficits over the previous two months have shown a decline, easing
pressure on the dollar.
   Some traders also are focusing on the department's March 15
release of the 1987 fourth-quarter current account balance, which
measures foreign trade in goods and services.
   In the third quarter, the service portion of that statistic
showed a deficit for the first time, and that deficit was expected
to increase in the fourth quarter. The amount of increase could put
pressure on the dollar.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.30 yen, up from 128.47
Wednesday. But later in London it retreated to 129.15 yen. By the
time trading concluded in New York, the dollar was worth 129.12
yen, lower than 129.40 yen quoted late Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound stood at $1.7680, unchanged from
late Wednesday. Later in New York the pound was quoted at $1.7700,
slightly more expensive than $1.7673 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Wednesday
levels included: 1.6943 West German marks, down from 1.6978; 1.4050
Swiss francs, up from 1.4030; 1.2531 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2571; 5.7310 French francs, down from 5.7385; 1,248.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,248.25.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with rates late
Wednesday included: 1.6955 West German marks, up from 1.6945;
1.4035 Swiss francs, up from 1.4005; 5.7355 French francs, up from
5.7345; 1.9025 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9013; 1,249.25 Italian
lire, up from 1,247.00; and 1.2535 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2558
   Gold bullion fell in London to $427.80 a troy ounce vs. $429.50
late Wednesday. In Zurich, it fell to $429.00 from $429.50 bid late
Wednesday and in Hong Kong it fell to $433.96 from $434.95.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell $3.10 a troy ounce to $427.70.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.22 a troy ounce, down
from $6.24 late Wednesday. On the New York Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery was quoted at $6.264 an ounce, up 4.8 cents.

<HEAD>Money Supply Rises In Latest Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Feb. 22, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $2,952.8 billion from $2,946.4 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,724.2 billion from $3,721.5 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $762.1 billion from $759.9 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $2,920.6 billion, a 4.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,684.3 billion, up 5.2 percent, while M1
rose 2.2 percent to an average of $756.1 billion.
   The Fed said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for
M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly
lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The Fed
has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $1.07 billion in
the week ended Feb. 24, compared with a gain of $444 million a week
earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $187 million day in the week ended
Wednesday, up from $132 million.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $272.5 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $272.1 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Plunge On Slack Demand, Packer Plant Closing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Some cattle futures prices plunged the 1{-cent limit allowed for
daily trading Thursday due to slack demand for beef and reports of
a packer plant closing, analysts said.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures retreated; energy
futures were down; precious metals were mixed; and stock-index
futures advanced.
   Tight supplies of slaughter-ready cattle have driven up the
prices asked by producers, but sales of beef have slowed during the
Lenten season and packing houses are caught in middle, analysts
said.
   Swift Independent Packing Co. said Thursday it would close its
Dumas, Texas, slaughter facility next week, at least temporarily,
and traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange feared other plants
also would close, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst in Chicago for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   A wave of plant closings could lead to a backlog of finished
cattle, ultimately forcing cash cattle prices lower, he said.
   The sell-off was exacerbated by the record-high number of
unfilled buy orders for live cattle going into Thursday's session,
said Tom O'Hare, an analyst in New York for Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co.
   When live cattle for April delivery fell below the key support
level of 71.20 cents a pound, traders rushed to offset those open
``long'' positions with sell orders, accelerating the slide, he
said.
   ``When you have a lot of open interest it has the potential for
making the market very volatile,'' O'Hare said.
   ``A lot of people have gotten in in the last couple of weeks,
but the movement of beef carcasses and boxed beef has been
insufficient to make people continue to be long.''
   Hog futures retreated on reports that Japanese inspectors had
detected residues of sulfamethazine, a possibly carcinogenic feed
additive, in shipments of U.S. pork, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .80 cent to 1.50 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in April at 70.62 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were 1 cent to 1.50 cents lower with March at 79.07 cents a
pound; hogs were .02 cent to .80 cent lower with April at 42.45
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .30 cent lower
with March at 52.25 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures prices dropped sharply on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Grain futures also ended lower.
   The beginning of the South American soybean harvest, coupled
with expectations of increased farmer selling of soybeans, created
concern that abundant supplies could depress cash prices, analysts
said.
   The wheat market drifted lower amid nervousness about the
Agriculture Department's new series of surplus wheat auctions,
analysts said.
   The USDA sold 10 million bushels of surplus wheat on Tuesday.
But the agency announced after Thursday's close that it had sold
just 1.4 million of the 10 million bushels it had offered on
Wednesday. Another auction on Friday has the potential of putting
another 10 million bushels of surplus wheat onto the open market.
   Corn prices fell only slightly, with support stemming from ideas
the Soviet Union had purchased more U.S. corn than the USDA has
confirmed, said Ted Mao, an analyst for Shearson.
   Wheat settled 1} cents to 2} cents lower with March at $3.04\ a
bushel; corn was \ cent to 1\ cents lower with March at $2.00} a
bushel; oats were 2 cents to 7{ cents lower with March at $1.86 a
bushel; soybeans were 4\ cents to 8 cents lower with March at $6.23
a bushel.
   Oil futures started out strong, then sold off sharply and
settled near the day's lows on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 17 cents
lower with April at $15.50 a barrel; heating oil was .44 cent to
1.04 cents lower with April at 42.89 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .27 cent to .55 cent lower with April at 44.40 cents a
gallon.
   Gold futures followed oil prices lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange, while silver futures moved higher due to silver's value
as an industrial metal, said Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Gold settled $3 to $3.40 lower with April at $429.10 a troy
ounce; silver was 4.3 cents to 4.8 cents higher with March at
$6.264 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures slipped lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .10 point higher at 268.45. The underlying
spot index lost .09 point, closing at 267.89.

<HEAD>Plant Closing Announcement Shocks Workers, City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers contemplated other jobs and city
officials thought about attracting other employers after General
Motors Corp. said it planned to close the only plant still making
Pontiacs in Pontiac.
   While company officials blamed market conditions for the demise
of the Pontiac Fiero, workers said engineering innovations and
better promotion could have helped.
   Pontiac General Manager Michael Losh blamed the market
conditions for sagging Fiero sales, from 101,720 in 1984 to 47,156
last year.
   Workers were sent home Tuesday after Losh announced that the
plant will shut down after the 1988 model year, idling 1,109.
   The Fiero plant was one of the first at GM to accept
Japanese-style team organization of workers and was used as a model
for other plants, United Auto Workers Local 653 President Harold
Cox said.
   But some workers said the teamwork idea evidently did not extend
to business decisions.
   ``We built the best quality in the corporation for four years,''
said one, Dale Jorden of Clarkston. ``Why are we being laid off?''
   Analysts and others pointed to an overall drop in sales of
sporty, two-seater cars like the Fiero. Toyota MR2 and Mazda RX7
sales also have lagged.
   In addition, the Fiero had problems including engine fires so
frequent that GM recalled the entire 1984 Fiero production run late
last year.
   GM already had closed a foundry, another car assembly plant, a
heavy-duty truck plant and a bus plant in Pontiac and put more than
1,200 other Fiero workers on layoff.
   The Fiero is the last Pontiac manufactured in Pontiac, though
the division will still be based there, noted City Council
President Emmett Elliott Jr., who is also a Local 653 officer.
   ``It was a business decision, but from my position, I'd say it
was a bad decision,'' Elliott said. ``They sell a product all over
the country and label it a `Pontiac' and now they don't even build
it here.''
   Mayor Walter Moore estimated the city will lose $200,000 in tax
revenue and said he has asked to meet with GM officials to discuss
bringing new work to the plant.
   But Council President Pro Tem Peter Tenuta said it was not GM
the city should talk to. ``We should do everything we can to try to
fill those buildings with non-automotive-type jobs,'' he said.
   Cox said he was sorry GM did not do more to promote and market
the car, which was labeled revolutionary when introduced nearly
five years ago because of its mid-engine design, space-frame and
plastic body panels.
   Dick Long, UAW Local 653 vice president, said delaying
engineering changes such as addition of power steering undoubtedly
hastened its demise.
   ``I think the engineering community let us down,'' Long said.
   The announcement came without warning. Only last week GM
approved a $15 million special advertising campaign for the Fiero.
GM's Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada Group called 12 skilled toolmakers
back to their jobs last week to work on tooling for a redesigned
1990 Fiero.
   Dave D. Campbell, a GM vice president and director of operations
for the Pontiac group, said the decision came at a meeting Monday
after an intensive review that began only three or four weeks ago.
   Losh would not speculate on whether the Fiero plant might reopen
to build a new product.
   Campbell said one possible future product would be a
plastic-body replacement for the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet
Camaro that is scheduled for the 1991 model year.

<HEAD>Mulheren Detention Hearing Moved to NY from NJ</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A detention hearing for stock speculator John
Mulheren, accused of threatening a witness in the Ivan Boesky
insider trading probe, has been moved from New Jersey to New York.
   U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy ordered the hearing moved up
from 2 p.m. Friday in Fort Monmouth, N.J. to 10 a.m. in Manhattan
at the request of defense lawyer Otto Obermaier.
   The defense attorney said he wanted the hearing moved up ``to
prevent the prosecution from delaying _ and allowing Mr. Mulheren,
ultimately, to be released on bail.''
   Obermaier claimed federal prosecutors would seek a psychiatric
evaluation of Mulheren to hold him, in effect, without bail for 30
days.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Gage, while denying the
government wanted to delay bail proceedings for Mulheren, conceded:
``It would be irresponsible for us not to get an adequate medical
opinion.''
   Mulheren, 38, the senior partner at the Jamie Securities Co.,
was arrested on weapons charges Feb. 18 by police in Rumson, N.J.
and a federal criminal complaint filed in Manhattan accused him of
threatening a witness in the Boesky probe, identified only as
``Witness X.''
   Mulheren was released without bond Tuesday on the New Jersey
charges, but was immediately taken into federal custody.
   The new hearing is scheduled before U.S. Magistrate Kathleen
Roberts.

   Bond prices barely budged in lethargic trading
Thursday as the market looked for more evidence on the strength of
the economy.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond finished unchanged and
its yield held steady at 8.31 percent, the same as late Wednesday.
   Most traders were said to be keeping a low profile in
anticipation of the Labor Department's unemployment report for
February, which is due out Friday and could shed some more light on
the economy's strength.
   ``It's been a dead calm in the bond market for the last several
days,'' said Harold Nathan, senior financial economist for Wells
Fargo & Co. in San Francisco. He said a new decline in commodity
prices, often viewed positively by bond traders concerned about
inflation, failed to cheer the markets.
   He said the market appears to have adjusted to a recent slight
relaxation in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board, and was
looking to the employment report for additional evidence on the
economy.
   ``We are not dipping into recession, but the question is how
fast are we growing,'' he said.
   Prices of short-term governments were unchanged to 1-32 point
higher, while intermediate maturities and 20-year issues were
unchanged, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.04 to 114.01. The Shearson Lehman Hutton
composite index, which makes a similar measurement, rose 0.19 to
1,192.39.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities were unchanged
in light trading, according to the investment firm of Salomon
Brothers Inc.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, fell 0.03 to 286.16.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 5.60
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills rose 4 basis points to 5.86 percent and one-year
bills edged up 2 basis points at 6.16 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 6 7-16 percent, down from 6{ percent late
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Chicago Doctor Indicted for Testimony on Birth Control Device</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chicago gynecologist was indicted for
perjury and on obstruction of justice charges Thursday over his
testimony on behalf of the A.H. Robins Co. concerning its Dalkon
Shield birth control device, the Justice Department said.
   Dr. Louis G. Keith, 53, an obstetrician-gynecologist at
Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, testified
falsely in a lawsuit about his role in tests regarding the transfer
of bacteria by the tail string of the intrauterine shield, a
federal grand jury alleged.
   Contrary to his testimony, Keith didn't design, direct or
conduct the experiments about which he testified, said the
nine-count indictment returned in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Fla.
   Keith testified that tests showed the tail string of the Dalkon
Shield didn't transfer fluids or bacteria.
   Keith's testimony came during a trial in Tampa on March 15,
1983, in which a woman, Linda Harre, was seeking damages for
injuries allegedly suffered by the Dalkon Shield.
   The maximum penalty for violating the perjury law is five years
in prison and a $10,000 fine. The maximum penalty for obstruction
of justice is five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
   The A.H. Robins of Richmond, Va., sought protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in August
1985 after thousands of women alleged they were injured by the
Dalkon Shield. Some 200,000 claims have been filed by women who
said the birth control device caused spontaneous abortions,
infections, sterility and other problems.

   A maker of 12-inch sidewalk bicycles is
offering to replace wheels that could shatter if overinflated, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday.
   The replacement program involves about 40,000 Model BMX-12 bikes
made by Rand International of Farmingdale, N.Y., the agency said.
Bikes were sold through Otasco and other stores in the East, South
and Southeast prior to January 1987.
   The 12-inch boys' bikes are blue and can be identified by the
Rand label on the stem of the front fork.
   The safety commission said no injuries have been reported, but
there is the danger that if the tires are overinflated the rims
could shatter, causing a hazard to bystanders.
   Rand is offering free replacement wheels to consumers who write
to Rand International, 51 Executive Blvd., Farmingdale, N.Y.,
11735. Interested consumers can call Rand at 1-516-249-6000 or the
safety commission at 1-800-638-2772.

<HEAD>Media General Rejects Sugarman Takeover Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media General Inc. as expected, rejected a
$1.75 billion buyout proposal from television producer Burt
Sugarman on Thursday.
   In a four-sentence letter to Sugarman, Media General President
James S. Evans said the founding Bryan family, which owns a
controlling interest in the company, deemed the offer unacceptable.
   Evans stated the family would vote against the proposal if put
to a shareholder vote, and that ``under the circumstances no
further action on the part of the board is appropriate.
   Sugarman controls 9.8 percent of Media General's 28 million
shares of publicly-traded Class A common stock and has offered
$61.50 per share for the remainder of the company's Class A and
Class B stock, or a total of about $1.75 billion.
   About 71 percent of Media General's privately-held Class B
shares are owned by Chairman D. Tennant Bryan and Vice Chairman J.
Stewart Bryan III. The rest is owned by relatives and others
closely associated with the family and Media General.
   The 559,168 Class B shares have the power to elect seven of the
company's 10 directors. Furthermore, any change in control of the
company requires approval from two-thirds of the Class B holders.
   After Sugarman made his buyout offer on Monday, the Bryans
issued a statement that their stock was not for sale at any price.
   Sugarman was traveling and was unavailable to comment on Evans'
letter, said spokesman Jeffrey Taufield in New York.
   Media General Class A shares fell $1.25 to $46.12{ a share
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Media General owns a number of daily newspapers, plus 32
weeklies and several television stations.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Resolution Opposing Loan to Mexico.</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Senate passing resolution. Also

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Wednesday night narrowly
approved a resolution by senators from steel-producing states
opposing a $400 million World Bank loan to help Mexico upgrade its
steel industry.
   ``It doesn't make any sense where we have unemployed steel
workers walking up and down the streets of the cities of this
country,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who with Sen. John
Heinz, R-Pa., proposed the resolution.
   The resolution was attached on a 48-45 vote to legislation that
would outlaw most uses of lie detector tests by private employers.
Final action on that bill is scheduled for Thursday.
   Heinz complained that the amount of aid in the loan is
equivalent to what would be a $4 billion bailout of the U.S. steel
industry _ which is 10 times larger than the Mexican steel industry
_ at a time when American steel employment has dropped by 56
percent over the past 12 years.
   However, the resolution was opposed by Sens. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn.; Bill Bradley, D-N.J.; Ted Stevens, R-Alaska; John Chafee,
R-R.I., Daniel J. Evans, R-Wash., and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.
   Bradley said the loan is just the type of aid needed to assure
that a non-Marxist government will continue to rule in Mexico.
Other opponents of the resolution said the Senate should not be
interfering in every decision made by the World Bank.
   Earlier Wednesday, Metzenbaum said Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III has agreed to vote against the loan if he cannot persuade
the bank to delay its consideration. The World Bank board, which is
made up of 22 members representing 151 member countries, is
scheduled to take up the loan proposal Thursday.
   Baker agreed to the move following a meeting called by Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., Metzenbaum said.
   Metzenbaum said he warned Baker that support for the World Bank
in Congress could evaporate if the loan were made. The United
States provides 20 percent of the World Bank's funding.
   ``It is absurd for the American government to contribute to a
World Bank policy that will hurt the American steel industry and
American steel workers,'' the senator said.
   ``The kind of assistance the World Bank plans to give to Mexico
to make its steel industry more competitive is exactly the kind of
assistance this administration has refused to give to our own
industry here at home,'' he said.
   A Treasury Department spokesman said it is the agency's policy
not to comment on a vote until it occurs.
