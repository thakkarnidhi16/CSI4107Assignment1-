   A chain-smoker who had been ordered by a
judge not to puff in front of her children won the right to light
up again.
   The appeals division of the state Supreme Court granted a stay
of the order Tuesday, permitting 41-year-old Elizabeth Roofeh to
smoke in the presence of her husband and children pending a hearing
scheduled for September.
   Mrs. Roofeh said Wednesday she already is trying to kick the
habit.
   ``I was only doing it (smoking) to annoy my husband,'' Mrs.
Roofeh, who is seeking a divorce, said as she left for her first
session at a non-smoking clinic. ``I'm coughing like crazy. I don't
think it's good for the kids.''
   Mrs. Roofeh's husband, Jahanshan, an orthopedic surgeon, went to
court last year, arguing that her smoking is harmful to their
children, ages 6, 7 and 9. He said he tried unsuccessfully for 12
years to get her to curtail her habit.
   Last month, Judge Ralph Diamond ordered Mrs. Roofeh to confine
her smoking to a small room in the couple's six-bedroom home. Her
attorney, Joel Brandes, appealed, contending such an order is
unconstitutional.
   Roofeh's attorney, Stephen Schissell, had no comment on the stay.

<HEAD>Jay Schroeder's Restaurant Victim Of Second-String Quarterback
Woes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Being a second-string quarterback can
be hard on business, as the Washington Redskins' Jay Schroeder has
discovered.
   Schroeder, backup to starter Doug Williams, says the restaurant
operating in this Washington suburb under his name ``was a business
venture that didn't work out.''
   The owners of J. Schroeder's All-Pro Restaurant recently decided
to close the eatery because of mounting debts. Schroeder allowed
his name to be used for the establishment in exchange for a small
percentage of its profit and an agreement to appear there several
times a week. He declined to discuss the closing, saying the
restaurant's problems were ``for me to know.''
   Schroeder lost his position as the Skins' starting quarterback
in midseason last year. The Skins went on to win the Super Bowl
under Williams.
   ``Having the second-string quarterback's name on the restaurant
did not help business,'' said Bruce Sandground, general manager at
the Sign of the Whale, another Falls Church restaurant.
   Former Redskins' quarterback Joe Theismann owns three
restaurants in the area that bear his name. But Theismann began his
career as a restaurateur just as his career was beginning to take
off, while the opening of J. Schroeder's last year coincided with
Schroeder's slump.
   Schroeder said he was looking into other business opportunities.

   An Ohio woman who watched a TV show on
unsolved crimes supplied the tip that led to the arrest of a man
wanted in the poisoning death of a California beauty queen,
authorities said.
   Steven Paul Mack, 39, was arrested without incident in this Salt
Lake City suburb after a dozen squad cars closed in on his car
Tuesday, said police Sgt. Bill Brusik. Mack was being held at Salt
Lake County Jail on $500,000 bail.
   Authorities in Sacramento, Calif., had been seeking Mack, 39, in
the slaying of Karen Grace Winslett, 21, of Carmichael, Calif.
   Winslett had won the title of Miss English Leather in Las Vegas,
Nev., shortly before she disappeared in 1987. Her body was found 12
days later in her car, parked behind a North Sacramento motel.
   Detectives said she died of a large dose of Percodan, a pain
killer. They said Mack was linked to the crime by physical and
other evidence that the detectives would not detail.
   Sacramento County Sheriff's Sgt. Tennise Allen credited the
Sunday night showing of Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``America's Most
Wanted'' with bringing about Mack's arrest.
   Following the show, an employee of a country club in Marion,
Ohio, called her local sheriff's department to say she recognized
Mack as having once worked at the club.
   She also recalled having received a telephone call from someone
in Utah in February asking for a man named Sean Paul Lanier. A
check of club personnel records had showed no one by that name had
worked there.
   Salt Lake City police were alerted, and Mack was arrested after
he left a home been purchased by a Sean Paul Lanier in November,
authorities said. was unarmed and taken by surprise.
   The arrest is the fourth of an escapee or suspect stemming from
the show, according to Fox.
   Mack, a forger and burglar who served two prison terms and was
paroled in 1985, sells novelties and sports and clothing items,
authorities said.
   Sacramento police also said Mack is a suspect in a similar
slaying of a 19-year-old woman in Marion County, Ohio.
   In all, the ``America's Most Wanted'' episode generated 170
calls on a toll-free number shown on the screen.
   The show, which premiered earlier this year, has as its host
John Walsh, who has been active in the movement for better police
efforts to trace missing children since his son, Adam, was abducted
and slain.
   Another arrest stemming from the show was that of a murderer who
had escaped from an Indiana prison in 1986 was found last month
working as a supervisor at a homeless shelter in New York City.

<TEXT>
   A tough year for farmers is in the wind _
that is, if an old Comanche Indian legend holds true.
   According to the legend, the wind direction at precisely sunrise
on the day after the first day of spring will tell what kind of
weather and farming conditions the next year will hold for the
region.
   If the wind, called Taba'na Yuna'e in Comanche, comes from the
east or northeast, good harvests should follow; if it blows from
the north or northwest, conditions will be average. A west or
southwest wind doesn't bode well, and a south wind is just plain
bad news.
   Records on the annual ceremony are said to show a 92 percent
success rate since 1906, the first year settlers gathered to see
what the winds had in store.
   ``Chief'' Frank Runkles, who has been performing the ceremony
for 15 years, began his dance Tuesday with supplications to
Wakantanka, the Father Spirit, and Mikeana, Mother Earth, as well
as the winds.
   ``The Mother Earth is revered because she gives us food to
eat,'' he said. ``Wakantanka is the Great Father above _ we seek
his blessings.''
   As he spoke, a southerly wind blew so hard that Indian dancers
from an Amarillo Boy Scout Explorer Post had to shield a ceremonial
fire as it was ignited.
   The gusts died down as sunrise neared. Seconds before Runkles
caught the first glimpse of the sun over the distant horizon, a
gust whisked in from the north, then reversed direction at the
moment of sunrise, giving an official reading of west-southwest _
bad news for farmers.
   Despite the Indians' claims of predictive accuracy, however,
farmers don't necessarily need to worry.
   Last year, smoke from Runkles' fire indicated a south wind and
poor conditions, but Southern Plains farmers ended up with one of
the best cotton harvests on record.

<HEAD>High School Sing Reaches Screen With Patti LaBelle</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in report for Thursday AMs.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Above a pawn shop in downtown Toronto, Patti
LaBelle rips into a group of lackadaisical Brooklyn high school
students.
   In her first major dramatic role, the pop star is playing an
inspirational teacher in a movie musical based on Sing, the annual
song-and-dance competition in Brooklyn's schools.
   The legendary program at such schools as Erasmus Hall gave rise
to such talents as Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond. But with the
urban decay of the past decade, only a dozen schools now take part.
   The struggle to preserve that old Brooklyn spirit has inspired
the film, ``SING,'' with a plot centered on education board plans
to close a beloved high school where generations of immigrants got
their start.
   With songs from the writer of ``Footloose'' and ``Fame'' and a
tempestuous love story between a street-smart Italian kid and a
Jewish princess, the Tri-Star Pictures production now shooting in
Toronto is scheduled for release in February 1989.
   ``I'm hooked on it. I'm one of those people who think about
community and pulling together and family,'' said LaBelle, the
rhythm and blues artist who first hit the pop charts in the 1960s
with the Blue Bells and later in the '70s with the trio LaBelle.
She has appeared in two previous films, ``A Soldier's Story'' and
the TV movie ``Unnatural Causes.''
   In ``SING,'' she plays Mrs. Devere, an adviser who shakes her
junior class students out of apathy.
   ``She's very uplifting to the kids,'' Labelle said between takes
of her chart-targeted big number, ``Total Concentration,'' in which
she demonstrates how to put over a song.
   Producer Craig Zadan and screenwriter-lyricist Dean Pitchford,
who won an Academy Award for ``Fame,'' said they created the part
with LaBelle in mind and waited until she found time to do it.
   ``There's a real honesty there, nothing phony about her. In her
own way she's lived through what this teacher has gone through,''
said Pitchford.
   LaBelle has charmed the crew by introducing them to her own home
cooking _ fried chicken and potato salad. But she's not sure about
life as an actress.
   ``I'm not a Cher. I don't know if I'd have enough patience to do
another movie,'' she said, complaining about the number of retakes.
``It hurts enough some times that you want to cry. I like to
perform live.''
   However, director Richard Baskin, who co-produced Streisand's
landmark ``Broadway Album'' and is making his first feature film,
said LaBelle looked great in the first rushes.
   Co-stars include Lorraine Bracco who played Tom Berenger's wife
in ``Someone to Watch Over Me,'' Louise Lasser of ``Mary Hartman,
Mary Hartman'' fame and George Dicenzo who was Rob Lowe's boss in
``About Last Night.'' The young lovers are Peter Dobson and Jessica
Steen.
   For co-producer Neil Meron, a Brooklyn and Sing alumnus, the
project is a labor of love.
   ``In the high school I went to, Sing no longer exists,'' Meron
lamented. ``Brooklyn is one of the oldest communities in America,
and the way those communities found to express themselves was
through music and dance.''
   To research the film, the production team talked with veteran
teachers in Brooklyn and attended a Sing performance at Midwood
High School where faculty member Bella Tillis launched the program
in 1947.
   Sing competitions involved reviews or skits created and staged
by a committee from each class. The musical skits were judged on
sing night when freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors got to
strut their stuff. In the 1950s and '60s, when Sing was at its
peak, the competitions were fierce.
   Lyricist Pitchford also found inspiration in England, where he's
been working with the Royal Shakespeare Co. on the Broadway-bound
musical, ``Carrie.''
   ``After `Fame' the last thing I wanted to do was another high
school film set in New York about kids who sing and dance,'' he
said.
   ``But England has tradition and history we can only approximate
in America. The closest thing to that kind of longevity is in East
Coast settlements like Brooklyn. Sing became a metaphor for that
tradition.
   ``I developed an enormous affection for Sing and the
neighborhoods of Brooklyn and a real despair for the passing of
this tradition.''

<DATELINE>AKROTIRI, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New discoveries by American
archaeologists indicate that humans could have settled on Cyprus
around 9000 B.C., 1,500 years earlier than previously thought.
   The finds also indicate that some species of ancient animals
survived here at least 1,000 years after they were believed to have
become extinct.
   If proven correct, the discoveries mean that Cyprus was one of
the earliest human settlements north of Africa, along with the
island of Corsica, also in the Mediterranean.
   ``If these dates are corroborated, the site will have provided
by far the earliest archaeological evidence for island colonization
anywhere in the Mediterranean,'' Dr. Stuart Swiny, director of the
Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute, reported in a
recent lecture.
   Scientists had previously dated man's arrival on Cyprus around
7500 B.C.
   But archaelogists digging on a slope near the sprawling British
air base at Akrotiri on Cyprus' south coast recently found pygmy
hippopotamus and dwarf elephant bones, some mixed with shells,
flint and ash.
   Archaelogists believe the flint, an early cutting tool, was used
to slice meat from the animals. The ash indicated cooking fires.
   Carbon dating placed the remains at around 9000 B.C., a
millenium after those species of animals were believed to have died
out.
   Swiny said that the animals, common to many Mediterranean
islands thousands of years ago, were wiped out by climatic changes
during the last Ice Age that ended around 12,000 years ago.
   ``We thought ... these animals died out because of natural
causes _ they couldn't get enough food or enough water,'' Swiny
said in an interview after the lecture.
   ``But now it looks as if man was also responsible for wiping
them out.''
   The Akrotiri excavation is sponsored by the University of Nevada
and the American Schools of Oriental Research, which sponsors the
Cyprus American institute. The dig is under the direction of Dr.
Alan Simmons, who currently is in Nevada.
   The original discovery was made in 1980 by a British security
officer at Akrotiri, Maj. Brian Pile, then a lieutenant, while he
was training his men to seek out unusual objects.
   Underground excavation at the site, eight miles south of the
port city of Limassol, started last July and will continue this
summer.
   Swiny said the actual age of the site will remain questionable
until results of further tests are obtained.
   The finds are only some of the important discoveries unearthed
by American archaeologists in the last few years on Cyprus, the
center of trade routes between Europe and the Middle East for
centuries.
   The island is studded with relics of a history that spans more
than 10,000 years, during which more than a dozen civilizations,
including Achaean Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, Armenians, Venetians
and Ottoman Turks left their imprint.
   Americans are involved in six of the 20 digs currently being
made in the Greek-controlled southern part of Cyprus.
   The Cyprus American institute provides logistical help at one
sponsored by Brandeis University, of Waltham, Mass., at the Late
Bronze Age town of Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios, 18 miles northeast
of Limassol.
   It was one of the biggest Bronze Age settlements on Cyprus and a
center for the island's ancient copper trade. Cyprus is the
Phoenician word for copper.
   Last summer archaelogists uncovered the remains of a 13th
century B.C. building, covering more than 10,764 square feet and
once at least two stories high, that was apparently destroyed by
fire.
   ``It's the biggest and most important building at the site and
one of the biggest of that period in Cyprus,'' said Dr. Alison
South Todd, the dig's co-director.
   ``We also found some inscriptions which are very rare to the
period in Cypro-Minoan script,'' she added.
   Cypro-Minoan, which resembles the script used in Minoan Crete
4,000 years ago, has never been deciphered.
   The presence of these inscriptions and the huge storage capacity
of the building, known as Building X, suggest it was either a
palace or a town hall.
   The storage room, more than 60 feet long and 24 feet wide,
consists of an outer wall and six stone pillars that once supported
the roof.
   The shards of at least 47 jars, some once as tall as six feet,
have been found. All apparently had been smashed in the fire. But
six intact jars were later discovered in pits below the floor.
   Todd discovered a tomb, considered one of the richest and best
preserved ever found on Cyprus, while digging an exploratory trench
out from the building.
   The oval-shaped tomb contained the skeletons of three young
women, a child about 3 years old and three infants. They apparently
had social status and wealth.
   The women had been buried with gold and silver jewelry, bronze
and bone artifacts, containers of wine with small cups inside and
cylindrical ivory cosmetic boxes.

   An experimental treatment for enlarged prostate
glands shows promise as an outpatient alternative to surgery that
hospitalizes about 400,000 American men a year, researchers say.
   An enlarged prostate makes urination difficult by constricting
the urinary tract, and the experimental procedure widens the
narrowed portion by inflating a balloon, said Flavio Castaneda of
the University of Minnesota.
   Test results show complete or significant resolution of the
urination problem in about 80 percent of patients with the most
common type of enlargement, he said.
   The half-hour procedure is done with only a local anesthetic and
without an overnight stay in the hospital, he said.
   Standard surgery requires general anesthesia or a spinal
injection that numbs the lower part of the body, and a hospital
stay of several days.
   The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that surrounds the
urine-carrying urethra. In older men, it frequently enlarges and
puts pressure on the urethra, making urination more difficult.
   The experimental technique is to be described Thursday by
Castaneda's colleague, Wilfrido Castaneda-Zuniga, at a meeting of
the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology in
Orlando, Fla.
   More than 60 patients have been treated with the experimental
procedure, called balloon urethroplasty, at the University of
Minnesota, Castaneda said in a recent telephone interview.
   The patient takes a tranquilizer and the urethra is numbed with
local anesthetic. A thin, flexible tube with the balloon on its tip
is inserted into the urethra and guided to the narrowed portion,
where the balloon is inflated.
   For the Minnesota patients, the urination problem was erased or
significantly eased in almost 80 percent of cases in which most
enlargement was from the side lobes of the prostate, rather than
the middle lobe, Castanada said. Most patients have predominant
enlargement of side lobes, he said.
   When the main problem was the middle lobe, the success rate
dropped to about 30 percent to 40 percent, he said.
   No recurrence of symptoms has been seen in any patient helped by
the procedure, he said. Forty-eight have been followed for more
than six months after the procedure, including one followed for
three years, he said.
   ``We're at this point unable to know how long it (symptom
relief) will last on the average,'' Castaneda said.
   Abraham Cockett, professor and chairman of the urology
department at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New
York, called the concept interesting.
   But he said more patients must be studied, and for periods
longer than at least a year following the procedure, to better
assess its effectiveness.
   Removing prostate tissue with standard surgery relieves symptoms
for some 15 years, said Cockett, who is secretary of the American
Urological Association.
   In another presentation at the meeting Thursday, participants
are to discuss an experimental alternative to removing gallbladders.
   About 500,000 gallbladders are removed in the United States
annually. Gallstones are the most frequent reason, said Eric
Martin, director of cardiovascular and interventional radiology at
the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York.
   In two patients, Italian scientists have instead guided a
flexible tube through the skin and into the gallbladder, used it to
remove gallstones and injected a solution to turn the gallbladder
into scar tissue.
   ``I still think it needs a lot of work, but it's exciting,''
said Martin.
   He noted that machines called lithotripters, now used to
pulverize kidney stones, are also being studied for destroying
gallstones.
   It is too early to tell how lithotripters and the surgical
technique tried in Italy will fit in to future management of
gallbladder disease, he said.

   A ostrich farmer thinks county
commissioners may have their heads in the sand for failing to agree
that an ostrich has as much value as a turkey.
   The dispute is over an Ohio law that allows farmers to be
reimbursed by the county if dogs kill their farm animals.
   Michael Erwin of Morrow filed a $600 claim for two ostriches
killed by dogs.
   But Warren County Commissioners said Tuesday damages can be
collected only on animals that provide meat, eggs, or feathers, and
ostriches didn't.
   ``No one could think of any (agricultural value of the
ostrich),'' said commission President George Terwilleger.
   He invited Erwin to appeal, and Erwin said he would.
   ``I think that ostrich farming has as much credibility as cattle
farming or sheep farming,'' said Erwin, 32.
   He said ostrich hides and feathers are sold in Ohio, and he
plans to breed ostriches for meat. He said the meat is more of a
bargain than turkey.
   ``You get a lot more bird for your money.''

   One of two drug charges against John Zaccaro
Jr., the son of 1984 vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro,
has been dismissed for lack of evidence.
   District Judge Francis McCaffrey on Monday threw out a charge of
possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
   After Zaccaro's 1986 arrest, McCaffrey ruled inadmissible eight
grams of cocaine and records of drug transactions seized by police
from Zaccaro's car. The judge said at the time that the search
warrant was based on insufficient evidence.
   Zaccaro still faces an April 4 trial on a charge of selling a
quarter-gram of cocaine to a state trooper while Zaccaro was a
student at Middlebury College.
   McCaffrey also said defense attorneys cannot claim at the trial
that Zaccaro was a victim of selective prosecution because the
issue does not relate to guilt or innocence.

   Oscar the Grouch, the guru of garbage on
television's ``Sesame Street,'' has been asked to remove all
recyclables from his trash can home.
   The famous character on the long-running PBS-TV children's show
recently received a letter from Paula S. Barnabie, who works for
the Camden County Office of Solid Waste.
   Every day, Ms. Barnabie wrote, the clank of aluminum, the crunch
of newspapers and the tinkle of glass can be heard as Oscar fights
his way to the surface of his trash can to snarl at Sesame Street
residents.
   ``I watch the program every day with my nephew and I just
couldn't take it any more,'' she said. ``It would be so much nicer
and environmentally sound for you to have a recycling bucket near
your trash can.''
   Camden County will even give the tetchy titan of trash one of
its brand new recycling buckets, she informed Oscar. The bright
yellow buckets ``can be dirtied up in no time flat'' to match the
rest of his dirty, dented decor, she said.
   The producers of Sesame Street are considering Ms. Barnabie's
suggestions, said Gail Y. Miyasaki, a spokeswoman for Children's
Television Workshop, the show's producer.
   Ms. Barnabie said she has not heard from Oscar, however.
   ``If he recycled, he'd be able to find a pen and paper in that
can to write back to me,'' she said. ``I hope he doesn't tell me to
go `scram.'''

   Don Bailey's face and Burt Reynolds' body
have been sprawled across the side of a warehouse for 10 years, but
City Commissioner Vicki Coceano says she wants to beautify the area
_ starting with Bailey.
   The 19-foot wide mural on Bailey's carpet store has Bailey's
head superimposed on Reynolds' body _ a takeoff on the actor's
centerfold pose in Cosmopolitan magazine several years ago. The
body reclining on a shag rug is nude except for flesh-tone bikini
trunks.
   ``He needs to be dressed or he needs to get off the rug,'' Ms.
Coceano said Tuesday.
   The issue arose when the commission rejected Bailey's request

   Suzanne Carrell beat a filing deadline
by 10 minutes to become a candidate for town moderator, a job most
residents had forgotten existed and which rarely has any duties.
   The unpaid job calls for her to moderate at town meetings, if
they ever are called under Telluride's custom-made home-rule
charter, which gives either the town council or residents the right
to call a town meeting twice a year.
   There have been only three such town meetings in the last nine
years, although there was an attempt to call one last year. That
failed for lack of a quorum.
   ``It is not a job with a lot of use,'' confirmed Town Clerk
Leslie Sherlock, who admitted forgetting about the opening until
someone brought it to her attention for this year's election.
   Carrell, who works in a liquor store and a bookstore, said she
decided to file for the post on Tuesday because she didn't have the
time to serve on the town council.
   But she said she was surprised to learn she may not have any
work to do.

<HEAD>Burnley Says FAA Can Be Slow in Improving Air Safety Rules</HEAD>

   Transportation Secretary James H. Burnley IV
says the Federal Aviation Administration sometimes needs ``the
bureaucratic equivalent of a cattle prod'' to move on safety issues.
   In an unusual condemnation of an agency by the Cabinet officer
who oversees it, Burnley accused the FAA of frequently harboring
``institutional resistance'' when the time comes to move harshly
against the nation's aviation industry.
   At times, he said, ``it has been necessary to use the
bureaucratic equivalent of a cattle prod to get the FAA to take
needed safety actions.''
   Burnley blamed the problem on the agency's structure and not its
employees. The FAA is charged with writing and enforcing safety
regulations for U.S. aviation, running the nation's air traffic
control system and promoting American air commerce.
   ``Because the FAA is charged with promoting and protecting the
industry's commercial interests, it is sometimes reluctant to take
safety and enforcement actions that impose significant costs and
burdens on that industry,'' Burnley told the Senate aviation
subcommittee.
   As an example, Burnley said FAA officials and industry
representatives opposed a 1986 proposal that airline and airport
employees be screened by security devices, arguing that the plan
was ``too burdensome.'' Even when the proposal was changed, the FAA
delayed implementing the proposal for a year, he said.
   Two weeks ago, Burnley told reporters the FAA was not being
strict enough in punishing airlines whose employees did not
effectively screen passengers for weapons. He sent FAA
Administrator Allan McArtor a memo March 8 asking him ``to give his
personal attention to this matter.'' McArtor agreed, Burnley said
Wednesday.
   ``Often it takes someone from outside the organization to insist
that there may be ways to enhance safety that are being
overlooked,'' he said.
   Burnley said the FAA ``is filled with competent, dedicated
professionals'' who are placed in ``an inherently untenable
position'' by the agency's structure.
   Asked after the hearing if he believed McArtor was responsible
for any of the agency's problems, he said, ``Allan's doing a fine
job, doing an outstanding job.''
   In a statement, McArtor said the FAA is taking steps to improve
its efficiency. ``The current system for dealing with aviation
issues is too slow and cumbersome,'' he said.
   The FAA has been criticized by some lawmakers in recent years
for failing to move quickly enough to expand the number of air
traffic controllers and for a lack of aggressiveness in making
other safety improvements.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the aviation panel, has
introduced legislation that would make the FAA an independent
agency in hopes of giving it the ability to respond more quickly to
problems.
   Burnley said the FAA could do a better job if its promotional
duties and the air traffic control system were removed from its
responsibilities. The agency should continue overseeing safety as a
part of the Transportation Department, he said, so, ``If you don't
get what you want out of an administrator, there's a secretary you
can collar.''

<HEAD>Officials Warn That U.S. Losing Ground Africa</HEAD>

   The United States is losing influence in
Africa by letting its military aid to the continent drop to an
unprecedented low while the Soviets provide 17 times as much
assistance, administration officials say.
   Sudan has asked the United States to remove its emergency
military stockpiles and facilities, and Somalia has rejected the
visit of a top-level military delegation, the officials say.
   U.S. military aid levels to Africa this year have dropped to an
unprecedented low of $25.2 million, said Deputy Assistant Secretary
of Defense James L. Woods.
   ``We have since last year lost our prepositioning rights in one
important African country, and have had important military''
negotiations canceled in another, Woods told the House subcommittee
on foreign operations Wednesday.
   Although he declined to name either country, another official
who spoke only on condition he not be named identified the first
country as Sudan. He said the non-aligned government of Sadiq Mahdi
was unwilling to honor political arrangements made by his
predecessor Gaafar Nimeiri, who was deposed in April 1985.
   U.S. relations with Sudan, strategically placed in eastern
Africa on the Red Sea coast, have been strained by Sudan's warming
ties with Libya.
   As a result of congressional budget cuts, as well as the less
cordial ties with the Khartoum government, U.S. military aid to
Sudan was canceled in fiscal 1988, along with six other African
countries. The administration will seek a renewal of the aid for
fiscal 1989, said the official.
   Somalia, upset with a drop of its military aid to $5 million
from some $20 million in 1986, rejected a visit by a high-level
U.S. military delegation, the official said. But the visit will
probably be rescheduled, he added.
   Woods warned that if the military aid for Africa remains at the
current level, ``we can no longer operate a meaningful aid program
to Africa.''
   The administration has asked for $740 million in economic and
development aid for Africa next year and $83.7 million in military
assistance.
   Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker told the panel that
``the perception in Africa is that we're opting out. And that
creates strains.'' U.S. military aid to Africa accounts for only 3
percent of the total military assistance to the continent, Crocker
said.
   In contrast, the Soviet Union has poured $15 billion into
African states since 1980, more than 17 times the U.S. input, he
said.
   In addition, the Soviets maintain 6,500 military advisers in
Africa, and Cuba has some 45,000 troops there, most of them in
Angola.
   ``Properly funded, the (U.S. military aid) program reduces
reliance on Soviet bloc hardware and advisers,'' Woods said.

<HEAD>Sharon Warns of War, Threatens Expulsions; Two Palestinians Killed</HEAD>

   Trade Minister Ariel Sharon warned that
Palestinian violence could lead to war with neighboring Arab
states, in which case Israel might expel Palestinians from its
occupied lands and from Israel itself.
   He made the comment Thursday, when Israeli security forces shot
and killed another two Palestinians and seven were reported wounded
in clashes throughout the occupied West Bank.
   Israeli troops also rounded up hundreds of Arabs in an attempt
to silence the leaders of the four-month uprising, Arab sources
said.
   In Lebanon, Israeli warplanes divebombed Palestinian guerrilla
bases on the outskirts of Sidon for almost an hour, the second air
raid in two days. Israel radio quoted Lebanese sources as saying 30
people were killed in the attack.
   Also Thursday, The Labor Party re-elected Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres as its leader and candidate for the premiership. He
said he would appeal to the nation to support the U.S.-initiated
peace process _ in essence an exchange of land for peace with the
Arabs.
   In the Balata refugee camp near Nablus, border policemen opened
fire on demonstrators throwing rocks, concrete blocks and iron bars
at them. Two protesters were killed, the army and the Israeli news
agency Itim reported.
   A Palestinian was shot in the leg and three border policemen
were injured by rocks in the clash, Itim reported.
   Thursday's fatalities raised the Palestinian death toll to 109
by U.N. count since violence broke out in the occupied territories
Dec. 8. One Israeli soldier has been killed.
   Sharon told journalists in Tel Aviv that, by failing to halt the
disturbances at their onset, Israel had lost its deterrent
capability. As a result, he said, Arab states could launch a
surprise attack against Israel.
   The hawkish former general, a leader of the right-wing Likud
Bloc, hinted that in such a war, Israel might expel Palestinians
and Israeli Arabs.
   Sharon referred to Israel's first prime minister, David Ben
Gurion, saying Ben Gurion refused to allow Arabs who fled the
country during the 1948 Middle East war to return to their homes.
   ``The rule that Ben Gurion determined then applies now too,''
Sharon said. ``Those who began the war in December 1987 must
remember that they are fully responsible for its results ...
Remember this well, not just the residents of (the West Bank towns
of) Halhoul and Qalqilyeh but also those of Jaffa (in Israel) and
(Israeli-annexed Arab east) Jerusalem.''
   Peres, who was re-elected by an overwhelming majority of the
Labor Party's 1,250-member Central Committee, accused the Likud of
frightening the nation into believing yielding occupied territories
would threaten Israel's existence.
   ``We will opt for a political solution,'' he said. ``The camp of
intimidation rejects any political solution. The camp of hope
believes in such a solution.''
   Speaking at the same party gathering, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin said: ``Peace is a more central element of security than
(occupied) territories.''
   In other developments Thursday, Israeli troops converted West
Bank schools into detention centers as they continued a campaign of
mass arrests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized
in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Among those detained in the overnight roundups Thursday were
several Palestinians allegedly responsible for drafting and
publishing the latest underground leaflets, police ministry
spokesman Nahum Mendel said.
   He declined to say how many suspects were arrested.
   In the West Bank city of Hebron, an Islamic official said
Israeli troops detained about 200 Imams, or Moslem relgious
leaders, in nighttime roundups this week. The official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said most of those held were members of
the fundamentalist Islamic Jihad movment.
   In Gaza, Israeli officials rounded up at least 15 Palestinians
Wednesday night, bringing to more than 110 the number of Arabs
arrested there in the last four days, the Gaza lawyers' association
said.
   Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic Patriarch of Jerusalem decided to
suspend the Palm Sunday procession because of the possibility of
violence along its narrow, winding route through Arab east
Jerusalem, said the Rev. Caudio Baratto, director of the Christian
Information Center.
   In another development, the government temporarily banned
publication of Israel's Communist Party daily, Al Ittihad.
   Amos Gilboa, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's adviser on Arab
affairs, said the 40-year-old newpaper's ``statements had become
far more extreme... and completely changed in character,'' since
the anti-occupation unrest began.
   The Communist Party has four representatives in parliament. It
has organized demonstrations and protests against Israel's handling
of the unrest and in favor of a Palestinian state to replace the
occupied territories' military government.

<HEAD>Trains Collide In China; 27 Dead</HEAD>

   Two passenger trains collided Thursday in a
Shanghai suburb, killing 27 Japanese students on a school trip, the
Japanese Embassy said. Other reports said more than 100 other
people were injured.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency said one of the trains had
ignored a stop signal when it left Shanghai station.
   There were discrepancies in death and injury reports. Foreign
Ministry officials in Tokyo, citing reports from the Japanese
Consulate in Shanghai, said the death toll of 27 included a victim
that was possibly Chinese.
   A total of 47 Japanese and 57 Chinese passengers were injured in
the crash, government officials in Tokyo said.
   Shigekazu Sato, an official with the Japanese Embassy in
Beijing, said the injured included 36 people from Gakugei High
School in southern Japan's Kochi Prefecture.
   The crash, in the Shanghai suburb of Fengbang, occurred at 2
p.m. when a northbound train leaving Shanghai for Hangzhou collided
with a southbound train arriving from Changsha, said Fu Fenghao,
spokesman for the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office.
   Fu said it had not been determined if there were other
foreigners on the train.
   The departing train's first two cars and the luggage car of the
other train were knocked off the tracks. Most of the victims
appeared to be in the first cars of the departing train, Fu said.
   Xinhua said the departing train ``rolled out of the Kuangxiang
station, ignoring the prohibiting signal, and collided with the
train that was entering the station.''
   Kazuyoshi Shoji at the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai said one
of the dead Japanese was Hideo Shimomura, identified by television
stations in Tokyo as a 16-year-old student.
   The 193-member Gakugei High School group was traveling on the
Hangzhou-bound train. Shoji said the group was in the car
immediately behind the engine.
   ``We were playing cards and suddenly there was a loud bang, and
things went flying all over the floor,'' said an unidentified male
student interviewed in Shanghai by the Japan Broadcasting Corp.
   ``There was a huge bump, and then one of our teachers came into
the car and told us to get out,'' said another student. ``We broke
the windows and climbed out.''
   The train tracks were blocked seven hours after the accident, Fu
said. He said soldiers, police and medical workers took the dead
and injured to nearby hospitals and that investigators were at the
scene.
   It was China's fourth fatal train accident this year. Three
train accidents killed 141 people in January.

<HEAD>Bipartisan House Sends Senate $1.1 Trillion Budget</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers are crediting the budget summit
accord between congressional leaders and the White House for the
bipartisan ease with which the House sent a $1.1 trillion budget
for fiscal 1989 to the Senate.
   The spending plan, which alters some of the domestic priorities
President Reagan had included in his own proposed package last
month, was approved 319-102 on Wednesday by the
Democratic-controlled House. In contrast to last year, when budget
writers toiled several weeks longer amid staunch opposition by
Republicans, GOP lawmakers this time voted 92-78 for the resolution.
   ``I think it would have been impossible without the summit,''
Rep. Delbert Latta of Ohio, ranking Republican on the House Budget
Committee, said afterward.
   ``Democrats and Republicans in the House are trying to work
together,'' said Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., chairman of the
budget panel.
   The spending plan would produce a deficit of $134 billion. It
would thus avoid spending cuts that would be required under the
Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law should the deficit miss the 1989
deficit target of $136 billion by more than $10 billion.
   To achieve that $134 billion figure, however, lawmakers agreed
to use economic forecasts made by the administration. Had the
legislators used the more pessimistic projections from their own
Congressional Budget Office, there would be $35 billion more in red
ink, triggering spending slashes that are considered particularly
untidy in an election year.
   Shortly after the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 508
points last Oct. 19, administration officials and congressional
leaders held four weeks of closed-door bargaining aimed at slashing
the federal deficit.
   The pact they emerged with last Nov. 20 set broad outlines for
federal budgets for fiscal 1988, which ends Sept. 30, and for
fiscal 1989.
   Their agreement settled in advance many of the disputes that
typically spawn bitter, long-running debates among lawmakers, such
as over how much money the government should spend for defense,
domestic and foreign assistance programs, and whether new taxes are
necessary.
   The 1989 budget resolution approved by the House precisely met
those summit targets, according to budget committee numbers.
   Thus, the package provides $299.5 billion for the Pentagon in
budget authority, the amount up to which the military can commit
itself in new contracts, and $294 billion in outlays, or money to
actually be spent next year.
   In addition, it provides $148.1 billion in budget authority and
$169.2 billion in outlays for domestic programs that are not
controlled by automatic formulas. And it allows $18.1 billion in
budget authority and $16.1 billion in outlays for foreign aid.
   The $14 billion in new 1989 taxes called for by the summit have
already been enacted into law. Lawmakers envision no additional
taxes for the year.
   The budget would grant a hefty increase to space and science
programs, although only about half as much as Reagan wanted. It
would also grant major increases in spending for education, the
homeless, battling drugs and research and testing for AIDS.
   The legislators ignored Reagan's proposals to end federal
assistance to Amtrak, the Northeast passenger railroad, and to some
development programs, and his effort to dramatically slash aid to
mass transit programs.
   Most federal agencies would be given a bit less money than they
would need to keep up with inflation. But many urban and rural aid
programs such as the Farmers Home Administration's rural
development grants and loans, which Reagan had slated for
substantial cuts, would receive the same amounts of money as this
year.
   And many programs geared toward helping low-income people, such
as job training, would receive enough money to keep up with the
rising cost of living.
   Military and civilian federal employees would be granted 3
percent pay raises.
   The budget resolution does not require presidential approval and
sets spending targets. The actual money will have to be provided in
later legislation.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said Wednesday
he did not expect full Senate action on the budget before the
second week of April.

   Representatives of states vying for the
superconducting super collider are seeking only about one-third of
the funding initially planned for the project next year, in what
they describe as a bow to political reality.
   Rep. Carl Pursell, R-Mich., said Wednesday that lawmakers from
six of the seven states still in the running for the $4.4 billion
physics research complex agreed to press for around one-third of
the $363 million requested by President Reagan in his 1989 budget.
   Representatives from the seven states formed a task force last
week to support the project, which has been attacked by
congressional critics as likely to siphon away money needed for
research in other areas. The dispute comes as both Congress and the
White House are trying to reduce the federal budget deficit.
   During a private meeting, the representatives discussed funding
``somewhere around the bottom of $100 million plus,'' Pursell said.
``We have not fixed on exact figures.''
   They also discussed target dates in their drive to ensure that
the project survives congressional budget cuts, Pursell said.
   ``As long as we've got good support from the leadership, we're
sure we can get through the budget process,'' Pursell said.
   The representatives will meet soon with House Speaker Jim Wright
of Texas and House Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois to
discuss appropriations, Pursell said.
   Officials have predicted that the super collider, centered on a
53-mile-round particle accelerator, will produce 4,000 jobs and
have an annual operating budget of about $280 million.
   Physicists at the center will study subatomic particles and the
physical nature of the universe.
   States that remain in the running for the project are Arizona,
Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
   Arizona was unrepresented at Wednesday's meeting, Pursell said.
   The Energy Department has said it plans to decide in November
where to build the super collider.

<HEAD>Administration Opposes Greater Contact with Vietnam</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is resisting calls
to raise the level of U.S. diplomatic contact with Vietnam, saying
it wants to maintain pressure on the Vietnamese to withdraw their
troops from Cambodia.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., on
Wednesday called for the establishment of a ``working U.S.
presence'' in Vietnam. They said little progress has been made on
numerous issues which remain as the ``legacy'' of the Vietnam War,
despite numerous visits to Vietnam by congressional and
administration delegations.
   The administration, however, said it opposed the lawmakers' call
for the creation of ``interest sections,'' which are typically
established between nations that don't recognize each other but
acknowledge mutual concerns.
   The United States and Cuba, for example, have interest section
personnel stationed in third-party embassies in each others'
nations.
   ``We continue to believe that political and economic isolation
is the most effective way of pressing Vietnam to end its occupation
of Cambodia,'' the State Department said in a statement released
Wednedsay.
   ``We are prepared to discuss normalization with Vietnam,
therefore, only in the context of an acceptable settlement in
Cambodia which includes the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops,'' it
said. Vietnam's military occupation of Cambodia is in its ninth
year.
   McCain and Ridge are both Vietnam veterans and McCain is a
former prisoner of war. They issued their call for greater
diplomatic contact with Vietnam on the 15th anniversary of McCain's
release after five years of captivity.
   McCain said establishment of interest sections ``falls far short
of diplomatic recognition, and certainly implies no approval of a
nation's policies.''
   He said that if no progress is made on issues such as Americans
still listed as missing from the Southeast Asian conflict, then
``the option of further normalization'' could always be set aside.
   McCain said several members of the administration had indicated
privately that they supported better communication between the
nations, but that he expected that the administration's
``official'' position on Vietnam would remain the same.
   McCain and Ridge said greater contact also is needed to
administer a two-year program to bring 8,000 to 12,000 children of
American soldiers to the United States.
   ``There is a tremendous logistical problem and barrier to
progress, just by the fact that all of our technical people must
travel in and out of Bangkok every time there is to be
communication,'' Ridge said.

<HEAD>Congress Moving to Cut Timbering in Alaska Rain Forest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Interior Committee is chopping away
at the huge timber harvests in Alaska's Tongass rain forest, the
nation's largest national forest and the timber cutting programs's
biggest money loser.
   The panel gave voice vote approval Wednesday to legislation
pushed by hard-lobbying conservation groups to scrap the 1980 law
guaranteeing that the U.S. Forest Service gets at least $40 million
a year to spend on Tongass timber sales.
   The money, much of it for logging roads to ancient stands of
huge trees, was mandated as part of the compromise that apportioned
public lands in Alaska for various uses, including commercial
development and wilderness.
   The compromise gave protected wilderness status to 5.4 million
acres of the 17.9 million acre Tongass, which has the nation's
largest populations of bald eagles and grizzly bears.
   The 1980 law, in what backers said represented economic
guarantees for southeast Alaska, set a goal of commercially
harvesting 450 billion board feet of Tongass trees every 10 years
from non-wilderness sections.
   No other national forest has a congressionally mandated harvest
goal or gets its appropriations without the year-by-year review
Congress gives to spending requests for other federal forests.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., said that because of low demand and
falling prices for wood pulp from Tongass, taxpayers have lost 99
cents for each $1 in sales, with some old trees going for $2 apiece.
   Vento called the 1980 law ``a mandate to overcut ... one of the
world's only temperate rain forests.''
   ``We're changing the entire environment when we cut 400- and
500-year-old trees,'' he said.
   Approved by the committee was a package put together by Rep.
George Miller, D-Calif., to scrap the 1980 timbering guarantees and
assure that the Tongass is subject to the same timber-harvest
planning practices applied to all other national forests.
   The bill would put a five-year moratorium on commercial logging
in about 1.7 million acres considered by the Southeast Alaska
Conservation Council to be prime fish and wildlife habitat
threatened by timbering.
   Miller's plan also would require the Agriculture Department to
renegotiate its long-term contracts to supply Tongass timber to two
large mills owned by Louisiana Pacific-Ketchikan Corp. and Alaska
Pulp Corp.
   About two-thirds of the Tongass production goes to these mills,
which convert it to pulp, principally for export to Japan. Critics
say the 50-year contracts, executed in the 1950s, give the
companies a regional monopoly and too large a voice in Forest
Service management decisions for the Tongass.
   Miller said the Tongass now is ``almost a scandalous operation.''
   ``We have a process that is not driven by rational forest
management,'' he said. ``We have cuttings driven by a political
bargain.''
   Don Young, Alaska's only House member and the ranking Republican
on Interior, opposed Miller's plan because ``it basically shuts
down the mills. ... We're talking about 6,000 jobs.''
   Young said the committee was being unduly influenced by
conservation groups such as the Wilderness Society and Sierra Club,
which have made the Tongass and a proposal to drill for oil in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge their major Capitol Hill
battlegrounds in 1988.
   Young called the environmental groups ``special interests'' and
said, ``The national environmental community is jerking our
string.''

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop says old

   ``The whole theme of this meeting is it's never too late to

workshop on health promotion and aging.
   How do older people maximize their health? The same way younger
people do, said Koop: don't smoke, don't drink too much, rest, eat
right and exercise.
   ``Old age is not a disease and there are many oldsters who are
disease free,'' said Koop. ``You don't necessarily have to have
your kidneys fail, you don't necessarily have to have dementia. ...
My plea would be to separate old age and disease. They don't
necessarily go together.''
   Smoking is a prime example of the never-too-late approach, said
Koop.
   ``There is a tremendous tendency on the part of physicians to
say, `Well he's over 65, he hasn't got many vices, hasn't got many
years left, why bother the poor old fellow?''' he said.
   ``But if they would just look him straight in the eye and say,
`You're not going to live as long or have as good a quality of life
as if you stop smoking,' if he stops he will note an immediate
benefit.''
   Koop, 71, said he is convinced older people will shift to
healthier diets and exercise more if properly counseled by their
doctors.
   ``I do think you can change a person's behavior,'' he said. ``If
somebody is willing to look at him from a bird's-eye view and try
to rearrange his life and point out how he could do these things
and what the benefits would be, people listen and they benefit.''
   Even though the U.S. population is aging, he said, it is not
becoming less healthy.
   ``As we see people who are now in middle-age come along into the
graying years they are going to be far healthier than this
generation was when it entered the 65-and-older group,'' he said.
   ``These are the people who are jogging and swimming and hiking.
These are the people who are snacking on salad and yogurt. These
are the people who are wearing sensible shoes. They have stopped
smoking. They have given up hard liquor. They wear seat belts. They
understand the things they can do to preserve the quality of life
and the function they already have.''

   Brahms and Berlioz will be featured in the
concert halls, but the European Community Youth Orchestra has also
been asked to belt out the U.S. and Canadian anthems at a baseball
game between the Atlanta Braves and the Montreal Expos.
   The orchestra's brass ensemble is scheduled to play at an
exhibition game March 31 at Municipal Stadium in Palm Beach, Fla.
   The orchestra's 140 musicians, aged 14 to 23, come from all 12
countries of the European Community: Britain, France, West Germany,
Italy, Ireland, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, Spain,
Portugal and Greece.
   For the orchestra's 10th anniversary, it is making its first
tour of the United States, arriving from London in Palm Beach on
Monday.
   ``They've asked us to send the brass ensemble for the game,''
explained Boston-born Joy Bryer, the orchestra's secretary general.
She has lived in Britain for 31 years.
   ``We've mailed the scores to them all around Europe. They don't
know anything about America but what they see on television. Now
they'll be finding out more for themselves.''
   The brass section consists of 20 instruments _ trumpets, French
horns and others that furnish a maximum of volume.
   Mrs. Bryer gave reporters details about the trip on Wednesday in
Washington.
   During its stay in Florida, the orchestra will also send groups
to schools, hospitals and a community center at Belle Glade on Lake
Okeechobee, where the audience will be mostly migrant farm workers.
   Its first formal concert will be on April 10 in the West Palm
Beach Auditorium. Later concerts will be at Clearwater, Fla., April
11; New York's Avery Fisher Hall on April 13; Boston's Symphony
Hall on April 15; and a final performance at the Kennedy Center
Concert Hall in Washington on April 17. The conductor will be Erich
Leinsdorf.
   Part of the proceeds will go to anti-drug efforts and to Very
Special Arts, the fund set up by violinist Itzhak Perlman to help
handicapped musical students.

<HEAD>North to Receive Full Military Retirement Benefits</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Iran-Contra Arraignment Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Lt. Col. Oliver North is beginning his
retirement with more notoriety than most officers, but he is still
entitled to the same benefits as any of the other more than 1.5
million men and women drawing military pensions.
   North, the former national security aide who was indicted last
week in the Iran-Contra affair, announced two days later he had
decided to retire on May 1 from the Marine Corps.
   North said he was taking the step because he would probably have
to subpoena high-ranking government officials to mount his legal
defense and didn't want to do so as a military officer.
   By specifying a May 1 retirement _ a request that has been
approved _ North will have completed the minimum 20 years of active
duty required to retire with a pension.
   Unless an officer has served 20 years, he is not eligible to
receive any type of pension. Starting at 20 years of service, the
size of the pension for officers of North's age is computed on a
rising scale _ going from 50 percent of basic pay up to 75 percent
of basic pay after 30 years' service.
   In North's case, the lieutenant colonel is drawing $3,693.60 in
basic pay a month, or $44,323.20 a year. With exactly 20 years of
service, he will be entitled to 50 percent of that as a pension
payment.
   North's former boss, Rear Adm. John Poindexter, retired in
December with more than 29 years of service and is drawing a
pension of more than $52,700 a year.
   North will have to pay federal income tax on his pension
payments. But unless he goes back to work for the federal
government, he's free to collect his military pension without limit
for the rest of his life.
   Like his other former brothers in arms, North also will be
eligible for a number of other benefits to help ease his entry into
private life.
   For example, if he wants to continue shopping at a military
commissary or exchange, he'll have that right. The former Marine
will also be able to relax at military officer clubs, use military
recreation facilities and read books at military libraries.
   If he wants to shop for liquor at a military package store or
take in a movie at a theater on base, he can do that, too. And he
can also drop off his laundry at a base dry cleaning store or buy
new clothing.
   As a retired officer, North also is provided the right to
medical care at a military hospital, but only on a space-available
basis. Active-duty servicemen are given first priority.
   If he can't gain admission to a military hospital, North will be
covered by the Defense Department's CHAMPUS health insurance plan.
When he uses a private hospital and CHAMPUS, however, he'll have to
pay an annual deductible and 25 percent of his bill.
   As a retired officer drawing a pension, North also will be
eligible for burial in a national cemetery.

<BYLINE>UAW Says Ruling Allows ``Economic Warfare Against Working People.''
^By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber says
the Supreme Court dealt a ``blow to working families throughout
America'' by upholding a law limiting food-stamp eligibility for
striking workers.
   The high court said Wednesday a 1981 federal law imposing food
stamp limits on strikers' families does not violate any
constitutional rights.
   The 1981 law, amending the Food Stamp Act, generally bars a
family from becoming eligible for food stamps at a time when one of
its members is on strike. Families already receiving food stamps
when a member goes on strike are not dropped from the program but
are barred from receiving additional food stamps despite the loss
of income.
   The law was challenged by the UAW and the United Mine Workers,
and some of the unions' members. They said the law violated
strikers' freedom of association and speech, and denied equal
protection to strikers' families.
   The court, by a 5-3 vote, disagreed.
   Bieber said Wednesday's ruling ``serves only the interest of
those who wage economic warfare against working people.''
   He added, ``In a democracy which affords its citizens the legal
right to form trade unions and engage in peaceful strikes, it is
hypocritcal and inconsistent to punish the family members of those
who choose to exercise that right.''
   Writing for the court, Justice Byron R. White said: ``Union
strike funds should be responsible for providing support and
benefits to strikers during labor-management disputes. It was no
part of the purposes of the Food Stamp Act to establish a program
that would serve as a weapon in labor disputes.''
   But Justice Thurgood Marshall contended in a dissenting opinion
that the 1981 law amounted to such a ``weapon'' for management.
   ``No other purpose can adequately explain the especially harsh
treatment reserved for strikers and their families by the 1981
enactment,'' Marshall said.
   The Food Stamp Act generally excludes benefits for people, and
the households of people, unwilling to work. But Marshall noted
that people who can prove they quit their jobs for ``good cause''
may collect food stamps if otherwise eligible _ while strikers may
not.
   White was joined in upholding the law by Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor
and Antonin Scalia.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Harry A. Blackmun joined
Marshall's dissenting opinion.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the decision.
   The nation's food stamp program, paid for by the federal
government and administered by the states, has supplemented the
food-buying power of millions of low-income families since 1964.
   Participating households receive food stamp coupons that can be
used for food purchases at retail stores. Eligibility for food
stamps is based on income and several other factors.

<HEAD>Soviet Grain Harvest Up, But Quality Poor, U.S. Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Agriculture Department economists say the
Soviet Union's agriculture is still in trouble, despite a couple of
back-to-back bumper grain harvests.
   At the request of the United States, the Soviets opened talks
here last weekend on a new long-term grain agreement to replace the
current pact which expires on Sept. 30. The agreement commits
Moscow to buy at least a specified minimum amount of U.S. grain
each year.
   The preliminary one-day session was adjourned without anything
conclusive announced or any indication as to when and where the
negotiations would be resumed.
   But Chris Foster and Ed Cook of the department's Economic
Research Service note that the Soviet Union ``doesn't always meet
the provisions of the agreement'' by failing to buy the specified
minimum amounts.
   Last year's total Soviet grain harvest was 211.3 million metric
tons, up slightly from 210.1 million tons in 1986, the first time
that two consecutive grain crops of more than 200 million tons have
been produced by the Soviet Union.
   However, Foster noted that last year's Soviet harvest was of
``poor quality and contained above-average amounts of moisture.''
   Cook said Soviet agriculture still has many basic inefficiencies
and that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has had only slight
success so far in his efforts to reform his country's agriculture.
   ``Gorbachev seems now to be taking a less radical approach to
agricultural reform than was anticipated a year ago,'' Cook said.
   There has not been a dramatic shift toward a ``market economy''
and the promised increases in local autonomy for farm managers has
been slow to materialize. Rather, Cook added, ``The focus now seems
to be on making adjustments to the traditional system.''
   Cook, whose comments appear with Foster's in a forthcoming issue
of Farmline magazine, said the Soviet system historically has been
hampered by a lack of incentives and authority for farm workers and
managers. Policies have been decreed from above, with little reward
for greater efficiency.
   Gorbachev's reforms ``have succeeded somewhat in reducing
paperwork associated with agriculture, but incentives and autonomy
remain inadequate by our standards,'' Cook said.
   In the Soviet Union, money is still taken from profitable farms
and given to unprofitable farms, in part to even out differences in
farm wages, he said. Large disparities in income are avoided, but
there is little incentive to make a farm more profitable.

   Agriculture Department on-site reviews of
Farmers Home Administration operations in Texas have turned up sex
discrimination and severe shortcomings in the hiring of blacks and
Hispanics in agency offices.
   ``The prevailing view expressed by female employees during
interviews is that sex discimination often enters into employment
decisions,'' the report said Wednesday. ``This perception is
corroborated by the number of sex discrimination complaints lodged
and by the lack of women in higher graded positions.''
   The review was made last year under the USDA's Equal Employment
Opportunity (EEO) program, which calls for compliance checks of
several department agencies in various states, including FmHA, Soil
Conservation Service and the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service.
   Reports on the reviews have been released periodically by the
department's Office of Advocacy and Enterprise.
   In addition, the USDA office released a number of reports on
civil rights compliance by the agencies in Louisiana and Oklahoma.
In each case, the on-site review found the operations ``generally
in compliance'' with civil rights requirments and regulations.
   However, most of the civil rights reports noted numerous
deficiencies in the employment of women and minorities, and
shortcomings in outreach programs.

   A study of last year's wheat quality showed
that 76 percent of the hard red winter wheat samples graded No. 1
or No. 2, compared with 70 percent in 1986, the Agriculture
Department says.
   For hard red spring wheat, 75 percent graded No. 1, compared
with 70 percent in 1986, the department's Federal Grain Inspection
Service said Wednesday.
   The annual survey involved 12,739 wheat samples from the 1987
crop, said W. Kirk Miller, administrator of the agency. The samples
were taken during the first four weeks following local harvests
around the country.

   Congress never intended to outlaw state rules
against retaliatory firings when it gave the federal government the
authority to protect union workers, the lawyer for a Southern
Illinois woman says.
   Paul Alan Levy told the Supreme Court that lower courts erred in
ruling that Illinois could not penalize a company for firing a
union employee who filed a workers' compensation claim.
   He asked the court to overturn the decision and rule in favor of
Jonna Lingle, a Machinists union member dismissed from her job at
the Norge Division of Magic Chef Inc. in Herrin, Ill.
   ``The right of (state) action is available to both union and
non-union employees alike,'' Levy told the court in oral arguments
Wednesday. ``That right is independent of the rights enjoyed under
a collective bargaining agreement.''
   Illinois is one of 21 states with laws against retaliatory
firings.
   But a lawyer for Norge said the federal Labor-Management
Relations Act makes enforcement of union contracts _ through the
decisions of an arbitrator _ the province of the federal government.
   ``If independent state laws were enacted that flew in the teeth
of a labor contract, they were pre-empted,'' attorney Charles C.
Jackson told the court. ``Permitting the Illinois law to stand
would be an incentive to undermine collective bargaining.''
   Jackson conceded that states may act on health and safety
matters but said Mrs. Lingle's firing was a contract issue covered
by federal labor law.
   According to court records, the woman notified the Herrin-based
Norge in late 1984 that she was injured on the job and asked the
company to pay her medical bills, as provided for by the Illinois
workers' compensation law.
   Norge fired Mrs. Lingle a week later, contending she filed a
false claim.
   However, the Machinists' contract with Norge contained a
provision protecting workers from dismissal without just cause, and
the union filed a grievance the day she was fired.
   An arbitrator later ordered her reinstatement with back pay.
   But in the interim, Mrs. Lingle filed a circuit court lawsuit
contending the dismissal violated Illinois law and seeking
additional compensation.
   The relief available through the Illinois court was greater than
what she could receive through arbitration, which did not include
punitive damages and compensation for lost overtime.
   Norge shifted the case to U.S. District Court, where a judge
threw out Mrs. Lingle's lawsuit, ruling that state law was
pre-empted by the arbitration remedy provided by federal labor law.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago upheld the
dismissal in June 1987.
   The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the appeal in July.
   The State and Local Legal Center in Washington said 21 states
and the District of Columbia have laws protecting workers who file
compensation claims.
   It identified the states as California, Connecticut, Hawaii,
Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri,
Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.

   Disabled motorists suffer from a patchwork of
state regulations that leaves them vulnerable to parking tickets
when they drive to other states, say advocates of a national
parking symbol for the disabled.
   ``It is ludicrous for us to remove one barrier to the
handicapped by offering handicapped parking spots, only to erect
another by refusing an out-of-state resident the right to park
there,'' Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., told a House subcommittee
Wednesday.
   ``If a person is disabled in one state, does not logic dictate
that the same person is disabled in another state?'' he asked.
   Gejdenson has drafted legislation that would require states to
use a national handicapped access symbol and have reciprocity with
all other states. States that do not comply would have federal
highway safety funds withheld.
   A measure to withhold 2 percent of a non-complying state's
highway safety funds was approved by the Senate last year. The
House has not acted.
   Gejdenson said he raised the issue after being contacted by Ruby
DeGiovanni of Middletown, Conn., who started a campaign against the
system three years ago after she was ticketed in Lynn, Mass., while
parked in a handicapped zone.
   ``When states are allowed to ticket people for merely exercising
their right to a handicapped parking space, it discourages
handicapped people from going out,'' Mrs. DeGiovanni told the House
Public Works and Transportation subcommittee on surface
transportation. She called the current system ``ridiculous'' and
discriminatory.
   There are 6.5 million disabled Americans who use special parking
permits. Only 15 states honor handicapped parking permits from
every state, according to a Federal Highway Administration study
conducted last year.

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has
a respected new ally in his presidential campaign: Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, who hopes his Dukakis endorsement will end
speculation about a last-minute Bradley bid.
   Dukakis picked up fellow Democrat Bradley's endorsement here
Wednesday. The two held a news conference near the Statue of
Liberty staged to highlight the presidential hopeful's immigrant
roots.
   Bradley said he believes the Massachusetts governor is the best
Democrat to beat Republican front-runner George Bush.
   ``I believe Michael Dukakis can win. I believe he will be the
next president of the United States,'' Bradley told a crowd of
reporters and supporters at Liberty State Park.
   The senator promised to campaign for Dukakis both in New Jersey
_ which holds its primary on June 7 _ and around the nation.
   Bradley said Dukakis can defeat the vice president ``because he
is tenacious, innovative, resilient and disciplined.''
   ``This is a very important endorsement because it comes from one
of the most respected and one of the most accomplished public
figures in America today,'' Dukakis said, adding that Bradley would
be ``very, very important to our success.''
   Bradley said he hoped the endorsement would end talk about his
entering the race. The senator, a former Rhodes scholar and New
York Knicks basketball star, has said repeatedly he does not feel
ready for the White House.
   ``The plan I have for 1988 is helping Michael Dukakis,'' Bradley
said.
   He also said he did not expect to be considered as Dukakis'
running mate. Bradley said such a ticket would be too heavily
weighted toward the Northeast.
   ``I think Massachusetts and New Jersey have a lot in common, but
I don't think they go together on a national ticket,'' Bradley said.
   Bradley jokingly pushed aside a common criticism aimed by some
at him and Dukakis: that they are boring.
   ``It has been said of Michael Dukakis that he is dull, a charge
with which I am not unfamiliar,'' said Bradley, known as a somewhat
wooden speaker. ``But governance is not an amusement park.''
   Bradley also praised the other Democrats seeking the nomination,
singling out Jesse Jackson as ``running a campaign that challenges
the best in all of us.''

   Nagging disputes in Afghanistan, Central
America and the Middle East are casting a long shadow over the
Moscow summit only two months before President Reagan sets out on
his first trip to the Soviet Union.
   The outlook for a pact to sharply reduce long-range nuclear
weapons is not all that bright either. The U.S. Strategic Defense
Initiative has not been swept away as an obstacle, and differences
remain over how the bombers, submarines and missiles would be
scrapped.
   ``I wouldn't want to lay you odds,'' was Secretary of State
George P. Shultz's hesitant response Wednesday night to whether the
treaty would be ready for Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to sign during the May 29-June 2 summit.
   Mobile missiles and sea-launched cruise missiles are hard to
spot. That makes verifying compliance with the 30 percent to 50
percent arms reductions more difficult than last year's treaty to
ban medium-range nuclear weapons.
   Experts on the two sides are still trying to mesh conflicting
drafts. U.S. and Soviet negotiators in Geneva were directed by
Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to keep
working at the verification problem and to report to them at their
next meeting in Moscow April 21.
   A treaty signing is not a prerequisite for a successful summit.
Reagan and Gorbachev have plenty of issues to discuss at their
fourth meeting.
   But the report Shultz gave at a news conference of his talks
with Shevardnadze was generally bleak. It suggested the two leaders
might not have much to celebrate.
   Shultz seemed taken with a promise by the foreign minister to
consider changes in the way the Soviets deal with religious
observances and with visa applications. Emigration of ethnic
Germans and Armenians is up, Shultz noted.
   But he said Jewish emigration had reached a plateau. Besides,
Shultz said of the promised reforms, ``what we are interested in is
delivery.''
   When he turned to regional disputes, the clouds turned darker.
   Gorbachev is committed to end the Red Army's occupation of
Afghanistan after more than eight years of bloody strife with
U.S.-backed rebels.
   But Shultz said the United States would not concur in an
agreement to end the war unless the Soviets also suspended military
aid to the Marxist government in Kabul.
   The main purpose of the U.S. demand is to make it easier for an
estimated 5 million refugees to return home. Had Moscow accepted,
the United States would have stopped supplying Stinger missiles and
other weapons to the resistance.
   The moratorium would be in effect during the Soviet troop
withdrawal and for three months afterward.
   ``They didn't feel they could agree to that,'' Shultz said.
   And yet, he said, ``those conditions are needed for us to be
able to sign as a guarantor'' of an international agreement to end
the conflict.
   At the Soviet embassy, meanwhile, Shevardnadze was taking a
stiff stand.
   The aid is required by a Soviet treaty with the Kabul
government. ``Those are legitimate supplies, and we are not going
to rescind that treaty,'' he said.
   The picture in Central America and the Middle East wasn't
brighter.
   Shultz said the Soviets wanted U.S. military aid to an
unspecified number of Central American governments halted as a
condition for them to stop supplying Nicaragua for its war with
Contra rebels.
   ``It did not seem something we could pursue,'' Shultz said.
   On the Middle East, he said Shevardnadze envisioned an active
role for Moscow in Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   Shultz said that would get in the way of talks between the two
sides. ``The Soviet concept is sharply different from ours,''
Shultz said.
   And in the Persian Gulf, Shultz offered only hope that Javier
Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. Secretary-General, would be able to
persuade Iran and Iraq to end their 7{-year war.
   Referring to pictures of Iranian victims of alleged Iraqi
chemical weapons, Shultz said: ``The horrors of this war are just
being borne in on us practically every day. It's hard to think it
might get worse, but it does get worse.''
   For eight months, the United States has sought to persuade the
Soviets to support an international arms embargo against Iran,
which refuses to accept a cease-fire. But Shevardnadze evidently
did not give in.

   ``Moonlighting'' stars Cybill Shepherd and
Bruce Willis were left speechless by the 2{-week scriptwriters'
strike, but filled a five-minute gap in their latest script by
rocking to the tune of ``Wooly Bully.''
   Miss Shepherd and Willis kicked and sang along as Curtis
Armstrong, who plays novice detective Bert Viola, danced about in a
pharaoh's outfit, mouthing the words to the 1965 song by Sam the
Sham & the Pharaohs.
   The script for Tuesday night's ABC-TV show was written before
the Writers Guild of America struck March 7. But when it was filmed
last week, the producers discovered it fell about five minutes
short. So the cast improvised.
   ``Remember on the Ozzie and Harriet show?'' Willis told the
audience. ``See, sometimes their show would be short and then they
would bring Ricky Nelson out and he would sing a song.''
   Co-executive producer Jay Daniel said there are no more scripts
left, so ``Moonlighting'' probably will go into reruns.
   No new talks are scheduled between the 9,000-member guild and
the producers.

   Singer Dean Martin needs several weeks to
recover from a kidney problem, so the ``Rat Pack'' concert tour
with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. will go on without him, his
spokesman says.
   Martin, listed in fair condition Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, had been playing to packed houses with Sinatra and
Davis, who appear in concert Friday in Detroit before bringing
their tour to the East.
   Martin's physician, Dr. Charles Kivowitz, has advised the
entertainer to have at least three to four weeks rest before
returning to work, said Martin's publicist, Susan Reynolds.
   The tour continues March 26 at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena; March
28 at the Cleveland Coliseum; March 29 at Cincinnati's Riverfront
Coliseum; March 31 at Washington's Capitol Center; April 2 at the
Providence (R.I.) Civic Center.
   The spring tour concludes April 6 through 9 at New York City's
Radio City Music Hall, but resumes in the summer when it comes to
Los Angeles's Universal Theater July 7.

   Producers of the NBC series ``St. Elsewhere''
have decided to include a rambling speech improvised by actor Ed
Flanders in the show's final episode, scheduled for broadcast on
May 25.
   Flanders, who played Dr. Donald Westphall before leaving the
series earlier this season, was supposed to return for the final
episode and read a sentimental statement about beginnings and
endings.
   Instead, Flanders veered from the script and rambled on about
death. Co-executive producers Bruce Paltrow and Mark Tinker decided
not to reshoot the scene because filming ended Friday and the cast
disbanded.
   Instead, they will try to edit Flanders' speech, said
producer-writer Tom Fontana. ``We've done this before where he's
gone a little off the printed page. We've usually been successful
editing,'' he said.
   Neither Flanders nor his agent would comment.

   Malcolm Forbes, the American multimillionaire
publisher of Forbes Magazine, has bought himself a barony connected
to Clan Forbes of Scotland and can add a title his name if he
likes, says Burke's Peerage.
   ``Mr. Forbes can apply to the Scottish Court of Chivalry in
Edinburgh for a coat of arms, which I think he is going to do,''
Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of the British bluebloods'
guide, said Wednesday.
   ``The title is connected to land in Aberdeenshire and Mr. Forbes
can call himself Malcom Forbes of Barnes _ which I think would be
the more elegant _ or Forbes of Barnis-Forbes or Baron Forbes of
Barnes,'' Brooks-Baker said.
   ``I do not intend to use the title,'' The Aberdeen Press and
Journal quoted Forbes as saying. ``My father was born there (in
Aberdeenshire) in 1880. I thought it would be great to have the
title back in the Forbes family where it originated.''

   Domino's Pizza magnate Tom Monaghan
plans to open his collection of more than $30 million worth of
Frank Lloyd Wright creations to the public this week.
   Monaghan, president of Domino's and owner of the Detroit Tigers,
said he has been ``evangelizing'' about the architect for more than
40 years, so ``it seems natural for me to open the first museum
devoted to his work.''
   Monaghan has assembled a huge collection of Wright buildings,
drawings, designs, furniture, ceramics, decorative sculpture and
glass in less than four years.
   Monaghan's holdings include some 400 objects and considerable
archival materials that belonged to Wright, who died in 1959.
   This week, he is inaugurating the National Center for the Study
of Frank Lloyd Wright with a symposium beginning today and a public
opening of the museum Saturday.

   The gunman leveled his pistol at the
convenience store clerk and pulled the trigger, twice. Click,
click. It didn't fire either time.
   ``I think I am pretty lucky to be alive,'' said 64-year-old Nick
Daugherty, who had come to the aid of the manager during a robbery
Tuesday at a Cumberland Farms store.
   Manager Thelma Jones, 50, said the man first pointed his gun at
her, demanding ``all the money.'' She refused and screamed for help
from Daugherty, who was stocking shelves in the back.
   Ms. Jones said the man reached for the cash register but pointed
the gun at Daugherty as he approached to within 5 feet. Ms. Jones
said she heard two clicking sounds from the gun.
   ``I was shaking,'' said Daugherty, adding he yelled for the
gunman to get out of the store. ``He didn't say a word. I think he
was probably as scared as I was.''
   The gunman ran out, virtually into the arms of a police officer
who had spotted him earlier as a possible robbery suspect and
radioed for help. Detective Carl Oestreich ordered the man to drop
his gun, but the suspect continued to run.
   Oestreich ran after him and was soon joined by 15-20 other
officers who ran him down and arrested him. Police said they found
a gun that been dropped during the chase. It was fully loaded.
   ``I bet one guy better count his lucky stars,'' said police
investigator Jeff Gauntlett.
   Phillip Moultrie, 27, was charged with attempted murder and two
counts of armed robbery with a firearm, Gauntlett said.
   He was jailed without bond.

<TEXT>
   According to Martin Blades, a poor
fish and fries vendor, a crisis is gripping his country because
``the people who have the money, inside and outside the government,
are fighting for it.''
   He says he doesn't much care how this fight is resolved, as long
as the combatants let him and his neighbors ``live in peace with
enough to eat.''
   As he spoke, Blades held his 17-month-old daughter in his lap
outside the dilapidated wood and tin structure his family shares
with several others in the Chorillo section of Old Panama City.
   Neighborhoods like Chorillo have been relatively immune from the
violence borne of the campaign to oust military ruler Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   The opposition is led by a coalition of about 200 business,
professional, labor, student and other groups. And most of the
disturbances have occurred in middle- and upper-class neighborhoods.
   Noriega, who comes from a poor family, has tried to exploit
class and race differences in resisting the pressure to resign. He
and his government portray the opposition drive as an attack on the
poor and black by the rich and white.
   Blades is quite aware of the argument.
   ``I think this whole thing is a class struggle,'' he said.
``There were those who always had the economic power. They are out
and want to get back in, and they are trying to get the people to
turn against the government.''
   Blades was born in Chorillo and has lived most of his life in
this collection of ramshackle buildings adjacent the headquarters
of the Defense Forces that Noreiga commands.
   The neighborhood was condemned as unsafe and taken over by the
government more than 20 years ago. Thousands of people live there,
rent free.
   ``We just have to maintain them,'' Blades, 34, said of the
dilapidated structures.
   Blades, who makes a few dollars selling fish and fries outside
his home, once served in the Defense Forces. He still feels certain
solidarity with the institution, which he says has provided
stability.
   ``The people from the Defense Forces sometimes bring us lumber
and other things we need to repair the buildings,' he said.
   Like others in his neighborhood, Blades described himself as
apolitical, but discusses politics with ease.
   ``We all believe in democracy here. We are poor, but we are born
democrats because we do not have much,'' he said.
   ``Those who are born with much, I do not think they can feel the
way we do about all being equal.''
   Many of Chorillo's residents do manual labor or odd jobs or work
as taxi drivers. Many are unemployed.
   ``A change would not affect us much. I personally cannot say I
have lost all faith in politicians, but I do not trust them much,''
Blades said.
   Around the corner, Carlos Rivas rushed up a flight of stairs
carrying a large dish of rice and chicken from the soup kitchen at
Our Lady of Fatima Church. He and his pregnant wife watched as
their children ate.
   Rivas said he is a construction worker who has been out of work
since late November, shortly after the political crisis began to
affect the economy.
   ``I have always worked,'' he said. ``I am a painter also. I'll
do any kind of job.''
   The family lives in a single room with a stove that doesn't work
and a tiny altar. Rivas gets by by peddling canned food provided by
his father-in-law.
   But business is bad. Banks have been closed for week, the
government has not paid its employees and an opposition-called
general strike has virtually shut down Panama's economy.
   ``I am an honest man, but when I see them hungry, there are
times when I feel like going out and doing something desperate,''
Rivas said as his children ate. ``But my wife tells me to be
patient. There has to be a solution. If Noriega has to go, then he
should go.''

   House Democratic leaders said Wednesday they
would act quickly to send food and clothing to Nicaragua's Contras
if the rebels and the leftist Sandinista government reached a
cease-fire.
   The promise came just hours before the two sides announced they
had signed an agreement for a 60-day cease-fire to start April 1,
and that the Contras have agreed to accept only humanitarian aid
from a neutral organization.
   Neither the White House nor the State Department had any
immediate comment early Thursday after the cease-fire was announced.
   At midday Wednesday, a group of House members, including several
moderates regarded as crucial ``swing'' votes on the aid issue,
proposed a package of primarily humanitarian aid. The proposal was
offered as House Speaker Jim Wright began talking with Republicans
about breaking the aid deadlock.
   ``It is my earnest hope that we can obtain a bipartisan
agreement on humanitarian aid so that the bill can be scheduled
quickly,'' Wright, D-Texas, told reporters. ``That is the best way
to encourage the peacemakers in Central America.''
   Wright also had preliminary conversations on the aid issue with
House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., and with White House
Chief of Staff Howard Baker.
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said such a bill
could be approved next week if the cease-fire talks under way in
Sapoa, Nicaragua, bear fruit, and if aid would be consistent with
whatever agreement is reached by the Contras and the Managua
government.
   Both Wright and the Reagan administration expressed
encouragement at the progress being made by the two sides in their
first face-to-face, high-level talks.
   ``We want to be cautious but we are encouraged,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``They do seem to be making
progress,'' he said, adding that was ``somewhat surprising'' in
view of last week's Sandinista incursion into Honduras to attack
Contra camps.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Edward Feighan, D-Ohio, said three officials
from the General Accounting Office would leave for Honduras on
Thursday to track the disposition of small arms, ammunition, jeeps
and other materials that were brought to Honduras by the U.S.
troops.
   ``My concern is that the deployment of American troops and
weapons to Honduras could in fact be another diversion of arms to
the Contras,'' said Feighan, who requested the GAO investigation.
   The aid bill proposed by Rep. Buddy MacKay, D-Fla., and a dozen
colleagues would provide $48 million for food, clothing, medicine
and shelter for the rebels over the next year. It would allow the
CIA to deliver the aid, and to deliver some $2.5 million in
previously stockpiled weapons.
   The legislation also would guarantee President Reagan that he
could seek a quick vote on a new request for military aid sometime
in June, but would leave the exact nature of the follow-up aid
package up to Congress.
   The latter point seemed to meet a standard set by Wright, who
said any provision for a future aid vote would have to preserve
Congress' right to control its own legislation. Wright would oppose
any bill that includes the delivery of weapons as destructive to
peace efforts, an aide said.
   MacKay, who in the past has opposed any military aid to the
rebels, acknowledged that the package reflected ``a hardening'' of
his attitude toward the Sandinistas.
   ``It reflects a realization that we really can't walk away and
hope that (Nicaraguan President Daniel) Ortega is going to act in
good faith,'' MacKay said. ``The guy doesn't act in a way that is
rational, by my standards.''
   Several hard-line Contra supporters, most of them Democrats,
joined MacKay in sponsoring the aid bill, including Reps. Claude
Pepper and Dante Fascell of Florida. Moderate ``swing'' voters
supporting it were Reps. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla.; Martin Lancaster,
D-N.C.; Mike Andrews, D-Texas, and Jim Cooper, D-Tenn.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., who has led pro-Contra efforts for
the Republicans, said he also favored the MacKay bill. ``The
problem is whether the speaker will let it come to the floor,''
Edwards said. ``He is the obstacle.''

<HEAD>Seapower Panel Deletes Trident Sub In Favor Of Two More Aegis
Destroyers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stage for congressional warfare has been
set by a House subcommittee's vote to kill funding for the Trident
submarine in the 1989 budget and use the $1.4 billion savings to
build two more Aegis destroyers.
   The House Armed Services seapower subcommittee voted in closed
session Tuesday for the funding switch, conceived by the panel's
chairman, Rep. Charles E. Bennett, D-Fla.
   Word of the vote came Wednesday from Rep. Sam Gejdenson,
D-Conn., who vowed to fight it and predicted Trident funding would
be restored. Gejdenson's district includes the Electric Boat
shipyard, the division of General Dynamics Corp. that builds
Tridents.
   Bennett promised to defend the change when the full committee
looks at the fiscal 1989 budget next week.
   The subcommittee vote reflects congressional opposition to an
administration plan to sell two Aegis DDG-51 destroyers to Japan.
Bennett and others fear the United States would lose technological
secrets as a result.
   Under the subcommittee plan, the government would order five
Aegis warships in 1989 instead of the three requested by the
administration. The two extra destroyers would be deployed in Japan
under U.S. control, protecting Japanese security interests while
keeping the Aegis technology under wraps.
   Lt. Cmdr. Chris Baumann, a Pentagon spokesman, said Congress is
``very leery'' about selling the warships to Japan because of
revelations last year that Toshiba Corp. of Japan sold submarine
technology secrets to the Soviets. But Baumann said the Pentagon
has confidence in the Japanese government.
   ``Japan has held many of our secrets, so we don't seem them as a
security risk at all,'' he said. ``Toshiba is a company, not the
government.''
   The request from Japan for two Aegis ships has not been formally
made, but is expected, Baumann said.
   Navy officials had no immediate response to the Bennett plan,
but any suggestion to eliminate a Trident would likely be attacked
by the Pentagon.
   James H. Webb quit as secretary of the Navy last month in part
because Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci refused to allow him to
cut the Trident from the budget.
   Gejdenson, who is not a member of the Armed Services Committee,
noted that the seapower panel deleted funding for the Trident two
years ago, but funding was later restored by Congress.
   ``While I am clearly disappointed by the decision of the
seapower subcommittee, the subcommittee's decision is only the
first step in a lengthy and complex budget process,'' Gejdenson
said.
   But Bennett said in a telephone interview that he would fight to
keep the Trident out and the two extra Aegis ships in. He said the
program, which traditionally calls for one new Trident each year,
would be continued in the 1990 budget.
   Electric Boat is the sole builder of the 18,750-ton submarine,
which is armed with 24 long-range, multiwarhead missiles. The subs
are built at the company's yards in Groton, Conn., and North
Kingstown, R.I.
   The 8,300-ton Aegis destroyer, equipped with 90 missiles, is
being built by Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, and the Ingalls
Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss.

<HEAD>Study Finds High Complication Rate In Common Operation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A common operation intended to prevent stroke
causes death or serious stroke in 10 percent of the elderly
patients who undergo it, a study published today concludes.
   The study, based on a large survey of the operation called
carotid endartectomy, also found that two-thirds of the operations
were judged to be unnecessary or of questionable value.
   The researchers concluded that the operation is substantially
overused.
   In areas where the complication rate is as high as the average
found in the survey, the surgery should never be done ``because the
risks would almost certainly outweigh the benefits,'' said the Rand
Corp. doctors in their study published in the New England Journal
of Medicine.
   They recommended that the procedure be limited to hospitals and
doctors that have low complication rates.
   ``If you look for very hard-nosed proof of the operation, it's
hard to show that what we are doing is the right thing,'' said Dr.
John Skillman, a vascular surgeon at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital.
``There are a lot of indications, as this paper suggests, that a
lot of people are being operated on who don't need the surgery at
all.''
   The number of the operations grew from 85,000 in 1982 to 107,000
in 1985. However, in 1986 it dropped to 83,000, apparently as a
result of growing criticism of the surgery.
   ``It's my hope that with the publicity, it may be that people
are asking for second opinions,'' said Dr. Mark Dyken of Indiana
University, who was one of the first to question the wide use of
the operation.
   The surgery is performed on the carotid arteries in an effort to
prevent strokes. These arteries run up both sides of the neck. If
they become plugged, the flow of blood to the head is interrupted,
and some of the brain may die, resulting in permanent damage. In
the surgery, doctors open the arteries and clean out plaque that
partially obstructs them.
   ``You ought to have the operation if it is truly indicated for
you and if you have a surgeon with a record for complications that
is very good,'' said Dr. David H. Solomon, one of the Rand
researchers. ``Our guess is that if those two prescriptions were
followed, there would indeed be a lot less operations done.''
   The study reviewed the records of 1,302 randomly selected
Medicare patients who had the surgery in three different parts of
the country. A panel of experts judged that one-third of the
operations were justified, another third were questionable, while
the rest were clearly unnecessary.
   In most cases, the Rand researchers considered the operation
appropriate only if patients suffered warning symptoms, had
significant clogging of the carotid arteries and were in good
enough health to withstand the surgery.
   In the survey, more than 3 percent of the patients died as a
result of their surgery, while more than 6 percent suffered strokes
during or immediately after the operations. Solomon said that when
the operation is studied at big medical centers, the combined death
and stroke rate is usually under 3 percent.
   Other studies have shown that if people have small strokes that
cause momentary dizziness, brief blindness or other passing
symptoms, they face a 10 percent annual risk of major strokes. If
they have narrowed carotid arteries but no warning signs, their
annual stroke risk is about 3 percent.
   Despite the findings, however, experts said that some patients
probably benefit from the operation.
   ``I don't think it suggests at all that the operation shouldn't
be done,'' said Dr. Henry J.M. Barnett of Robarts Research
Institute in London, Ontario. ``It suggests, though, that a more
critical view of who should have the operation is required of our
profession.''

<HEAD>Narrow Expansion Of Bank Powers Proposed By Committee Chairman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The top lobbying group for commercial banks is
condemning a proposal by the chairman of the House Banking
Committee that would narrowly expand bank securities powers.
   Rep. Fernand G. St Germain, D-R.I., and the top Republican on
his committee, Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, on Wednesday proposed
legislation that would repeal parts of the Glass-Steagall Act,
which separated commercial from investment banking in 1933.
   But the proposal by St Germain and Wylie would restrict bank
expansion into insurance and real estate and includes an array of
pro-consumer provisions.
   Hours after the bill was released, the American Bankers
Association issued a statement saying the ``regressive ... and
anti-competitive'' proposal would be ``unequivocably opposed by the
banking industry.''
   And a member of the banking committee, Rep. Stephen L. Neal,
D-N.C., said he would offer substitute legislation mirroring a
broader bill approved March 2 by the Senate Banking Committee.
   However, the proposal picked up praise from the National
Association of Realtors, and the Independent Insurance Agents of
America says it can back provisions.
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., a strong proponent of the
Glass-Steagall Act, passed in reaction to the 1929 stock market
crash, predicted the St Germain-Wylie legislation ``will win a
bipartisan majority.''
   ``The chairman's bill hits the heart of the House consensus:
Congress should grant banks some new powers, but it should do so
carefully,'' he said.
   The bill would allow nationally-chartered banks to underwrite
and deal in commercial paper and municipal revenue bonds. About
4,600 of the nation's 13,650 commercial banks are federally
chartered.
   Bank holding companies could underwrite and deal in securities
through two types of affiliates: a limited subsidiary for
commercial paper and municipal revenue bonds and a full-power
subsidiary that would add securities backed by assets such as home,
auto and consumer loans to the list.
   ``Frankly, in terms of increased competition and increased
benefits to consumers from that competition, I would say no bill is
better than what he is recommending,'' Neal said.
   The Senate bill, which is supported by Neal and by the banking
group, goes further. It grants bank holding companies power to sell
corporate bonds and mutual funds and provides for a separate
congressional vote by 1991 on whether banks can underwrite
corporate stock.
   Like the Senate bill, sponsored by William Proxmire, D-Wis., and
Jake Garn, R-Utah, the St Germain bill bars bank holding companies
from selling insurance outside the state in which they are
headquartered and permits it only where authorized by state law.
   The bill would prevent federal regulators from expanding the
real estate powers of national banks and bank holding companies.
   St Germain also would require the Federal Reserve Board to rate
banks on their compliance with laws protecting consumers and
barring lending discrimination against poor neighborhoods.
   Only banks with good or excellent ratings would be permitted new
powers, although banks with an average rating could get more powers
if they make a specific commitment to make improvements.
   It also requires banks to provide ``lifeline'' checking accounts
with minimum fees for customers with less than $1,000 to deposit.
And it would require banks to cash federal, state and local
government checks for non-customers.

   Secretary of State Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze met
in Washington from March 21 to 23, 1988, for the second of a series
of meetings to review developments in U.S.-Soviet relations and to
prepare for the meetings between President Reagan and General
Secretary Gorbachev, which will take place in Moscow from May 29 to
June 2, 1988.
   President Reagan received the foreign minister for a discussion
of the state of relations and of objectives in the coming months in
arms control, human rights and humanitarian questions, regional
affairs and bilateral matters.
   The two sides gave priority attention to implementation of the
agreements and understandings recorded in the joint statement
issued by the president and the general secretary in their
Washington meeting, as developed further during Secretary Shultz'
visit to Moscow in February 1988. Both sides have worked hard and
some progress has been realized in a number of areas, but much more
needs to be done.
   By mutual desire, the meeting between the secretary and the
foreign minister began with a frank and businesslike exchange on
human rights and humanitarian questions. The discussion of these
issues will continue at the expert level.
   The secretary and the foreign minister and their senior experts
held extensive discussions on arms control.
   They reaffirmed the strong commitment made in the Washington
Summit Joint Statement to make an intensive effort to complete a
Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms
and all integral documents at the earliest possible date,
preferably in time for signature of the treaty during the next
meeting of the two leaders. The ministers reviewed the joint draft
texts of a protocol on inspection; a protocol on conversion or
elimination of strategic offensive arms; and a memorandum of
understanding, developed in accordance with their directive at the
February ministerial in Moscow. Reemphasizing their commitment to
effective verification measures, they agreed that the negotiators
in Geneva will seek to resolve the remaining differences in these
documents and report on progress at the next ministerial.
   The ministers continued their review of the key remaining
substantive issues associated with the treaty, as well as a wide
range of treaty topics of interest to each side, including problems
associated with: verification and counting of nuclear-armed
long-range air-launched cruise missiles; limitation and
verification of nuclear-armed long-range sea-launched cruise
missiles; and mobile ICBMs. They also reviewed issues related to
sublimits on warheads within the 6000 level.
   The secretary and the foreign minister also reviewed the
progress at the nuclear and space talks on the negotiations
regarding the ABM Treaty as discussed at the Washington summit.
They directed their negotiators in Geneva to expedite preparation
of a joint draft text of a separate agreement building on the
language of the December 10, 1987, joint statement issued by
President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev, allowing
consideration of any unresolved issues at the next meeting of the
secretary and the foreign minister in Moscow.
   Taking note of further progress in U.S.-Soviet full-scale
step-by-step negotiations on issues of nuclear testing and
confirming the commitment by the sides to the implementation of the
agreed mandate of these negotiations, the ministers instructed
their delegations in Geneva in particular to design and conduct as
soon as possible the JVE in full conformity with the December 9,
1987 ministerial statement; complete a detailed plan and schedule
for the JVE by the April ministerial; prepare a joint draft of the
TTBT protocol by the time of the JVE, to be finalized through the
conduct and analysis of the JVE; accelerate work on verification
issues for the PNET.
   The two sides reviewed the situation on conventional arms
control, with special reference to the mandate negotiations in
Vienna, and expressed the hope for their completion in the context
of a successful outcome of the Vienna CSCE meeting.
   The ministers discussed the ongoing multilateral and bilateral
negotiations toward a comprehensive, effectively verifiable and
truly global ban on chemical weapons, and instructed their
delegations in Geneva to continue working constructively in this
direction.
   The secretary and the foreign minister observed a test of the
communications link between the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers
established under the Nuclear Risk Reduction Center agreement
signed on September 15, 1987.
   The sides held extensive talks on regional questions. They
reaffirmed that the goal of the U.S.-Soviet regional dialogue
should be to help the parties to regional conflicts find peaceful
solutions that advance their independence, freedom and security,
and within this context reviewed the situation regarding
Afghanistan, Central America, Iran-Iraq, the Middle East, southern
Africa, Cambodia and the Korean peninsula. Contacts and
consultations on these issues will continue.
   The two sides examined the work under way to expand areas of
bilateral cooperation between the United States and the Soviet
Union.
   To continue their discussions on the wide spectrum of issues in
U.S.-Soviet relations and to ensure successful preparations for the
Moscow summit, Secretary Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze
agreed to meet again in Moscow from April 21-25, 1988, and then
again in the middle of May.

<HEAD>Psychiatric Hospital In Dispute Over An Animal Farm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sam the dog, Merlin the goat and scores of
rabbits, chickens, finches and mice have been declared fauna non
grata at the state hospital where they have helped soothe and
socialize mental patients.
   Mark Stebbins is the recreational therapist responsible for the
animal farm known since 1970 as the Stress Reduction Learning
Center at the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center. The hospital has
ordered the program to shut down and the animals off the grounds by
Friday.
   ``At this point what I'm doing is putting myself in the position
of willing insubordination,'' said Stebbins, 48.
   He said the hospital administration engaged in ``a sham and a
dupe job'' by investigating his program.
   ``We have many concerns,'' hospital spokeswoman Rita Amatulli
said Wednesday. Chief among them are Stebbins and his unorthodox
approach to protocol in that most bureaucratic of institutions, a
state mental hospital.
   Stebbins says his eight patients _ down from 16 a few months ago
_ feed, groom, exercise and care for about 60 animals.
   ``It opens them up to wonder. ... It makes them come alive,'' he
said of the patients. ``There's an incredible sense of purpose and
achievement because they know that these animals are dependent on
them.''
   ``It's just a really beautiful program,'' said photographer
Grace Harrington, who has been documenting the animal farm on the
Queens hospital grounds for 11 months. ``It's just so beautiful to
see how not only the animals are nurtured, but the patients are
nurtured.''
   Stebbins contends that hospital director Alan Weinstock targeted
the animal program for elimination shortly after he took over at
Creedmore about nine months ago.
   Stebbins said Weinstock asked him for information about the
patients in the program, which he provided, and then asked him for
budgetary and other information.
   Stebbins said he refused to provide the information because by
that time, he was convinced the hospital only wanted to shut down
his program. Among other things, he said, the administration
confiscated the stress center's van, which he said was needed to
transport both animals and patients.
   Recently, he said, he and his patients were ordered reassigned
and he was told to get rid of the animals. He said he reacted
``maybe arrogantly, maybe defiantly,'' and refused.
   Ms. Amatulli denied that the hospital set out to destroy
Stebbins' program. Weinstock merely wanted to evaluate its
effectiveness and costs, she said, and had no choice but to suspend
the program when Stebbins refused to cooperate.
   Stebbins said Creedmoor pays $200 a year for the program, and
that he pays about $2,000 annually out of his own pocket for many
of its costs. Many thousands of dollars worth of goods and services
are donated, he said.
   Stebbins has his supporters outside the hospital who have
rallied around him every time he has run afoul of the hospital
administration.
   State Sen. Frank Padavan, who acknowledges ``pulling Mark's fat
out of the fire for about 10 years,'' said problems with the
program mainly involve Stebbins' refusal to accommodate
bureaucratic procedures, many required by law.
   Padavan said he will meet with Weinstock in about two weeks to
see if he can work out a compromise that will save the program.
   ``The bottom line is that (Stebbins) gets very good results,''
said Padavan. ``Unfortunately, he listens to the beat of a
different drummer.''

   Here, at a glance, are some highlights of the
fiscal 1989 budget approved Wednesday by the House.
   _TOTAL SPENDING: The budget envisions $1.098 trillion in
government spending in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Total new
budget authority, which would stretch past the end of the fiscal
year, would be $1.232 trillion. The totals are roughly the same as
in President Reagan's proposed budget.
   _REVENUES: The government would collect $964 billion in taxes
and other revenues, based on Reagan administration estimates. That
includes $14 billion in new taxes already enacted into law for next
year, beyond which no new levies are anticipated by Congress this
year.
   _DEFICIT: $134 billion in red ink would be added to the national
debt, under the goal of $136 billion in the Gramm-Rudman
budget-balancing law.
   _PROGRAMS ELIMINATED: None. The president had proposed
abolishing several subsidies, including Amtrak, urban mass transit,
and some urban and rural development programs.
   _DOMESTIC SPENDING INCREASES: Budget increases for AIDS
research, airline safety, education, science and space, anti-drug
programs, and a pot of $100 million for possible boosts in Medicaid
and other entitlement programs.
   _FEDERAL PAY: Federal civilian and military employees would get
a 3 percent pay increase. Reagan had requested 4.3 percent for the
military and 2 percent for the civil service.
   _DEFENSE SPENDING: $294 billion, $8.6 billion over the current
year but short of the amount needed to keep pace with inflation.
   _FOREIGN AID: $16.1 billion.

<HEAD>Michigan Media Campaign Lacks Negative Ads Of Earlier Contests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spending for politicial advertisements in
Michigan, which holds Democratic caucuses on Saturday, has varied
widely among the candidates, with some making an all-out effort and
others hoarding their resources for later races.
   Leslie Dach, a spokesman for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
said the campaign was spending about $200,000 on Michigan
television.
   Dukakis is using two television ads _ a biography and another
spot stressing his executive experience in balancing budgets and
creating jobs. Dach said a new and ``wholly positive'' ad around
the jobs theme would be introduced today.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, his campaign floundering after
Super Tuesday, has much at stake in Michigan. He is running ads in
the state, but his campaign declined to say how much money he is
spending.
   Gephardt was using a TV biography and his ``Hyundai'' trade
spot. The bio features Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., the oldest
member of the House and a champion of elderly causes.
   In the trade ad, which helped Gephardt win Iowa last month and
should have appeal in a car-producing state, Gephardt alleges that
tariffs boost the price of a Chrysler K-car to $48,000 in South
Korea. He asks how many $48,000 Hyundais the Koreans could sell
here.
   As far as negative ads are concerned, ``there will be no first
use here in Michigan but certainly a willingness to respond,'' Dach
said.
   By Wednesday, no candidate had triggered anything like the punch
and counter-punch ads that characterized the races leading up to
Super Tuesday, March 8.
   Jesse Jackson planned a $70,000 television campaign in Michigan
starting today, with half of the money to being spent in Detroit.
The centerpiece was a Bill Cosby endorsement which he has used
before. Jackson also is spending $20,000 on radio, said spokeswoman
Pam Smith.
   Country singer Johnny Cash was praising Sen. Albert Gore of
Tennessee in radio spots around Michigan. Gore is focusing more on
the April 5 Wisconsin primary and spokesman Paul Risley said he was
unlikely to spend money on Michigan television, although ``you can
still buy time. I wouldn't rule it out.''
   The fifth Democrat still in the running, Sen. Paul Simon of
Illinois, is also making a stand in Wisconsin and plans no TV
advertising in Michigan. Spokesman Terry Michael said Simon, who
won last week's Illinois primary, is making new ads for Wisconsin
and expects to raise enough money in the next 10 days for a
$100,000-plus TV campaign there.

<HEAD>Blacks, Women To Receive $6 Million In Settlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some 370 blacks and women who were rejected
for jobs at Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. will be receiving
checks from the company averaging $16,200 to settle a
discrimination complaint.
   Roger Lambert, a spokesman for the automaker, stressed that all
the workers involved had been hired over the past few years and
that the $6 million settlement had not been prompted by anyone
suing the company for alleged discrimination.
   ``The matters in this agreement were not raised by any
individual at Honda of America Manufacturing,'' Lambert said
Wednesday in a telephone interview from company headquarters in
Marysville, Ohio. ``They were raised by the EEOC. No one went to
the EEOC.''
   Nevertheless, Honda and the EEOC reached agreement in a
settlement signed by the commission Tuesday and announced by both
parties Wednesday.
   ``I think the very fact that it has been reached in good faith
and announced indicates that both sides feel it is a fair, just and
reasonable agreement,'' Lambert said.
   The settlement ``provides $6 million in monetary relief and
seniority adjustments to the approximately 370 specifically
identified black and female individuals who applied for jobs at
Honda between 1983 and 1986,'' EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas said
in a statement.
   ``It's a significant, large sum that fits into what we
considered a just settlement,'' said Jay Friedman, director of the
EEOC's systemic investigations division that had worked on the case
since September 1984.
   In addition to the $6 million in back pay, Honda also was
required to provide jobs for all those people by Feb. 29, Friedman
said.
   ``They've all been hired in the last couple of years, and
they're still working here,'' Lambert said. ``We have not been
required to hire any additional people as a result of this
agreement, and we have not hired anyone any earlier than required
by our production needs.''
   The settlement was among the larger monetary agreements reached
in cases where no lawsuit was involved, but the $6 million is
dwarfed by some other EEOC cases, commission spokeswoman Renee
Devine said.
   ``We settled a similar charge in 1983 with General Motors for
$42 million,'' Ms. Devine said. There was no litigation in that
race and sex discrimination case, which involved hundreds of people.
   In a Pan Am World Airways age discrimination case that did
involve a lawsuit, the EEOC settled Feb. 3 for $17.2 million
shortly before a jury was to return a verdict, she said. The case
involved about 100 people.
   The agreement is the second EEOC-Honda settlement in less than a
year. The two parties reached agreement in June 1987 on an age
discrimination investigation that provided back pay totaling
$461,610. That case involved 85 people.
   Friedman declined to say whether additional discrimination
investigations against Honda were pending.
   Honda also agreed in the new settlement:
   _To expand its recruitment area to cover Columbus and expand
specific recruitment efforts for blacks;
   _To change promotion procedures and make a commitment to promote
additional black and female production workers;
   _To teach Honda managers about discrimination law.
   Honda employs about 5,900 people at manufacturing plants near
Marysville, outside Columbus, and in Anna, Ohio. Lambert said he
expects the employees to number about 8,600 by 1991 when the
company completes a $600 million expansion of an engine plant in
Anna and a $380 million new auto plant in East Liberty, Ohio.

<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government and
U.S.-supported Contra rebels signed an agreement Wednesday for a
60-day cease-fire to start April 1, both sides announced in a joint
communique.
   It was the first concrete step toward ending a six-year-old war
that has killed more than 40,000 people. Both sides scheduled a
meeting in Managua, the capital, for April 6 to start negotiations
on a definitive truce.
   ``I think, I hope and I believe that we have made a start, a
firm start to end this war that is killing ... sons of the same
country, sons of the same mothers,'' said Contra leader Adolfo
Calero.
   President Daniel Ortega said he hoped a regional peace plan
signed last August by the presidents of five Central American
nations would ``bury once and for all the military confrontation''
and ``end the hate and strengthen the brotherhood of Nicaraguans.''
   ``As president of Nicaragua, I hope this peace plan becomes a
reality,'' said Ortega, who had arrived unexpectedly for the
announcement.
   Within the first 15 days of the 60-day truce, the rebels agreed
to move into specified zones in Nicaragua. Delegations from both
sides scheduled a meeting in Sapoa on Monday to work out those
zones.
   The issue of the rebels laying down their arms will be discussed
at the April 6 talks.
   The Contras agreed to accept only humanitarian aid from a
neutral organization. That would exclude military aid from the
United States, which has been supporting the Contras since the war
began in 1982.
   In Washington on Wednesday, President Reagan tried to revive his
stalled effort to get Congress to resume aid to the Contras, which
ended Feb. 29.
   Joao Baena Soares, secretary-general of the OAS, announced the
details of the agreement after Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the
Roman Catholic archbishop of Managua, offered a brief prayer asking
that Nicaragua be blessed for ``all it has suffered.''
   Both men attended the three days of talks as observers and
signed the agreement as witnesses. Gen. Humberto Ortega, the
defense minister and head of the Sandinista delegation, signed for
the government and Calero signed for the Contras.
   The Sandinistas agreed to release 100 Contra prisoners on Sunday
and said the rest of the 1,500 jailed rebels would be released at a
date to be worked out at the April 6 meeting.
   The 1,800 former National Guardsmen in prison will be released
after a final truce agreement is reached. The army was called the
National Guard under the late President Anastasio Somoza, who was
overthrown by the Sandinistas in July 1979.
   The government also said it would guarantee freedom of
expression without restrictions, in accordance with the regional
peace plan. Many press liberties were barred for almost six years
under a state-of-emergency decree.
   The Nicaraguan government said it would grant gradual amnesty
and allow all political exiles to return to the country without
fear of persecution. It agreed to discuss the issue of military
service in a national dialogue with the internal opposition.
   The meeting at Sapoa, a town on the Costa Rican border, was the
first time the two sides met on Nicaraguan soil.
   Both Contras and Sandinistas earlier had agreed to a battlefield
truce while the negotiations, which began Monday, took place. A
reported Contra breach apparently did not affect the talks.
   The Voice of Nicaragua radio said earlier that Contras ambushed
an army truck at 2 p.m. Tuesday near Mulukuku, in the northern
province of Matagalpa, killing two soldiers. It did not appear
affect the negotiations.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros told reporters earlier that
``there could be isolated'' truce violations, ``but there is a
clear will from both sides to respect that decision.''
   U.S. troops in Honduras again held military exercises staged as
what officials called a show of force against Nicaraguan
aggression. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
withdrawal would be ``gradual.'' Pentagon officials said they
expected it to come next week.
   The U.S. troops were sent to Honduras as the request of the
Honduran president, who charged that Sandinista soldiers had
penetrated Honduran territory chasing Contra rebels as part of a
major military offensive. The Contras maintain base camps in
Honduran territory.
   At the time, Nicaragua said it had forced 2,000 Contras out of
its territory. Contra forces number an estimated 10,000 troops.
   At the start of the talks, the Sandinistas had said they would
only discuss a cease-fire. Two previous rounds of talks ended in
stalemate when the government maintained that position while the
Contras insisted on broadening discussions to include political
reform within Nicaragua.
   But they agreed to discuss political issues with the rebels on
Monday after signing an agreement with eight opposition parties in
Nicaraguan.
   The national dialogue as well as the cease-fire are included in
the regional peace plan signed by the presidents of Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras.
   The peace plan seeks to end civil wars in Nicaragua, in El
Salvador and Guatemala. It also calls for amnesties, democratic
reforms and an end to logistical and strategic support for
insurgencies.

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wearing a favorite pink sport jacket, a
62-year-old used-car salesman fired over what his boss said were
his loud and ugly clothes signed an out-of-court agreement to end
an age discrimination suit.
   ``I believe I have proved my point,'' Lee Grant said Wednesday
after ending the lawsuit known in courthouse circles as ``The Dress
of a Salesman.''
   Terms of the settlement, reached the day the trial was scheduled
to start, cannot be disclosed by either party under the agreement,
said Nancy Donnellan, who represented Grant in his lawsuit against
Darby Buick of Sarasota.
   But she said, ``We got a good settlement.''
   Darby's attorney, William Sizemore, didn't immediately return
telephone calls to his office Wednesday by The Associated Press.
   Grant charged he was forced out of his job at Darby Buick
because of his age even though he was the top salesman with 30
years experience.
   Grant said his attire led to his firing in May 1985, 1{ years
after C. Conrad Darby Jr. took over management of the dealership
from his father, Conrad Sr.
   The younger Darby started a ``new image'' campaign and required
that sport coats be worn for a more professional look.
   The 6-foot-8 Grant bought jackets he described as a pale pink
and a rainbow plaid. The latter, he said, has every color in it and
goes well with his gray slacks or green or red or blue.
   Sizemore, however, contended in court documents that Grant was
stubbornly resisting the new image campaign.
   ``One jacket was multi-colored ... and the other was a loud
fuchsia,'' he said.
   Sizemore said Grant had other irritating habits, such as
catnapping on the job. Grant said he only took a few winks, a habit
he acquired when the elder Darby was in control of the dealership.
   ``I wanted those sport coats vindicated,'' Ms. Donnellan said.
``They aren't really that bad.''

<HEAD>NC Lawmaker Rebuked For Personal Borrowing On Campaign Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee has formally
rebuked Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C. for improper use of campaign
funds but recommended against further punishment for his violations
of House rules.
   The ethics panel wrote Rose on Wednesday that it found ``clear
and convincing'' evidence he improperly borrowed funds from his
campaign and then failed to report the loans on his public
financial disclosure reports.
   In addition, Rose wrongly pledged a certificate of deposit from
his campaign as collateral on a personal loan and failed to report
liabilities to financial institutions on his public disclosure
statements, the committee found.
   The panel, formally the Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct, said those actions violate House rules.
   The personal benefit Rose received in each instance of
borrowing, and the lower interest rate received from use of the
certificate of deposit, ``are the kinds of abuses'' the rules are
designed to prevent, the committee said.
   The panel told Rose his behavior was ``deserving of reproach.''
But in concluding no further punishment was needed against the
eight-term lawmaker, the committee noted that Rose tried to correct
his mistakes.
   ``The committee recognizes and takes into consideration the fact
that all funds borrowed were replaced in full without the
insistence of this committee, and that this action was taken by you
prior to this committee beginning a preliminary inquiry,'' Rose was
told in the letter, signed by panel Chairman Julian C. Dixon,
D-Calif. and ranking Republican Floyd D. Spence of South Carolina.
   ``Furthermore, the committee recognizes that the campaign
certificate of deposit in question is no longer encumbered, due to
restrictions placed on it in connection with your personal
financial dealings.''
   Rose said, ``I am very happy that the committee found that no
further action was warranted, other than the letter to me.''
   He said he would not resign and described his violations as
``technical.''
   A House rule restricts the use of campaign funds to bona fide
campaign purposes. The committee called the requirement ``crucial
to maintaining public confidence in the fund-raising system
governing House members.
   ``The use of your campaign funds, as alleged and proved, is
entirely inconsistent with this principle,'' the committee letter
said.
   Rose, 48, was first elected to the House in 1972. He is chairman
of the House Agriculture subcommittee on tobacco and peanuts.
   The lawmaker said he was disappointed the committee did not
accept his contention that money he took from his campaign amounted
to repayment of loans.
   He said he apologized for signing his name to the certificate of
deposit, contending he hadn't known doing so violated House rules.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Thursday, while stock prices also fell moderately.
   After opening at 126.75 yen, the dollar slid further and closed
at 126.30 yen, down 0.85 yen from its close of 127.15 yen on
Wednesday. It ranged between 126.15 and 126.81 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 52.48-point gainer Wednesday, lost 113.95
points, or 0.44 percent, and ended the day at 25,781.28.
   ``Foreign exchange trading was quiet in Tokyo today without any
notable movements,'' said an official of a major commercial bank,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The dollar's marginal decline in Tokyo followed a lower closing
in New York. Analysts attributed the shift to a remark Wednesday by
Martin Feldstein, former economic adviser to President Reagan,
predicting the dollar could fall to a level of 120 yen or lower
over the next six months.
   Stock investors appeared to be staying on the sidelines to wait
out the results of the current fiscal year, which ends March 31,
said Hiromi Yoneyama of Wako Securities.
   But Yoneyama said many market participants remained optimistic
about market conditions after April.
   Share prices on the first section were mixed in lackluster
trading of about 500 million shares in the morning session.

<HEAD>AIDS Study Finds 15 Percent Of Incoming Inmates Test Positive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 15 percent of inmates entering
state prison from New York City have tested positive for the AIDS
virus, officials say.
   The finding, from anonymous blood tests of 500 inmates over two
weeks early this year or late last year, will prompt further
anonymous tests, said Peter Slocum, a spokesman for state Health
Commissioner Dr. David Axelrod.
   The blood tests were part of a state program to check more than
100,000 blood samples statewide in an attempt to determine how far
acquired immune deficiency syndrome has spread, Slocum said
Wednesday.
   The blood samples are being collected at prisons, where all
entering inmates are tested, as well as at family planning clinics,
tuberculosis clinics and other health centers, he said.
   About 70 percent of the prison system's 41,559 inmates come from
New York City, which has the nation's highest concentration of AIDS
victims.
   The inmate test results were disclosed after state Sen. Israel
Ruiz met with Axelrod and Corrections Commissioner Thomas Coughlin,
and called for the prison system to offer AIDS tests to inmates
about to be released.
   Ruiz said Axelrod told him that tests had indicated between 15
percent and 20 percent of the inmates might be carrying the AIDS
virus.
   The senator said that with about 16,000 inmates being released
annually, there could be 2,400 or more who are infected and don't
know it.
   Slocum said Ruiz was making ``a crude extrapolation based on
very limited data'' that might not give a clear picture of the
prison system as a whole.
   Slocum said Ruiz must have been basing his projections on what
Axelrod had told him about blood tests from inmates entering the
system at Downstate state prison in Dutchess County, about 50 miles
north of New York City.
   Corrections spokesman James Flateau said inmates are now tested
for the virus only on a doctor's orders for diagnostic purposes.
   Flateau said that as of the end of last year there had been 597
confirmed cases of AIDS among inmates. Of those, 346 died in
prison, 152 had been released and 99 remained in custody.
   Coughlin, Axelrod and Gov. Mario Cuomo have resisted calls for
mandatory AIDS testing of inmates and have thus far refused to
permit voluntary testing in prisons. Ruiz said he would propose
legislation to require it.
   Slocum said inmates about to be released are given counseling
about AIDS.
   Some researchers have estimated that up to 50 percent of those
testing positive for the virus will develop the deadly disease,
which cripples the body's immune system and leaves victims
susceptible to infections and cancer.
   Most cases of AIDS have appeared in homosexual men and
intravenous drug abusers. By March 21, 57,024 AIDS cases were
reported in the United States, and 31,836 victims have died.

   He said he has gotten commitments from the field of Democratic

Bush opted out.
   Koch said Bush explained to him in a telephone call that when he

   Gov. Mario Cuomo says that Jesse Jackson
would be ``good for the ticket'' as the Democratic vice
presidential candidate.
   ``If he doesn't become the Democratic nominee (for president)
and wanted to become vice president, I don't think he'd be a burden

Wednesday with Albany's WAMC radio. ``I think he would be good for

   Cuomo is one of several prominent Democrats who may play
kingmaker in negotiations leading up to the Democratic National
Convention in July. The governor has also not ruled out accepting a
draft for the presidential nomination himself if there's a
deadlocked convention.
   For his part, Jackson hasn't ruled out a possible run for vice
president if he doesn't win the presidential nomination.
   ``The vice president option would be a serious consideration,''
he said last year during an appearance on the ``Donahue''

   Connecticut voters overwhelmingly favor
Vice President George Bush in the Republican presidential race and
strongly support Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in the
Democratic contest, according to a Hartford Courant-Connecticut

   The survey showed that Bush is favored by 64 percent of likely
GOP voters polled, while his nearest opponent, Sen. Robert J. Dole
of Kansas, is the choice of 20 percent. Fourteen percent of those
polled were undecided and 2 percent selected former television
evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Among likely Democratic voters, Dukakis leads Jesse Jackson, 50
percent to 16 percent of likely voters, with 27 percent undecided,
the poll showed.
   Trailing far behind were Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee with
3 percent, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois with 3 percent, and Rep.
Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri with 1 percent.
   The Institute for Social Inquiry at the University of
Connecticut conducted the random telephone poll between March 9 and

   Whether people die young or have normal lifespans
appears to be ruled more by their genes than their upbringing, a
study today concludes.
   The research, conducted in Denmark, was based on a followup of
infants who were separated from their parents at birth.
   If the biologic parents died at an early age, there was an
increased chance that their children would die during their first
five decades, as well. But there was no such link with the deaths
of adoptive parents.
   ``We conclude that premature death in adults has a strong
genetic background _ especially death due to infections and
vascular causes,'' wrote Dr. Thorkild I.A. Sorensen and colleagues
from Hvidovre University Hospital in Copenhagen.
   By contrast, they wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine,
they found that early death from cancer appears to be associated
with behavior learned in the family.
   Researchers have long known that some diseases, such as heart
attacks and some forms of cancer, run in families. But it is often
unclear how much of the risk is inherited and how much results from
living habits that people pick up from their parents.
   The Danish study, based on people who never lived with their
biological parents, helps sort out these factors. It suggests that
genes play the largest role in determining whether people will die
at unusually young ages.
   The researchers wrote, ``The family environment apparently had
no effect'' on the overall mortality rate from natural causes,
although such influences cannot be ruled out.
   The researchers studied 960 families who gave up their children
for adoption between 1924 and 1926. They looked at whether the
adoptees died between ages 16 and 58 and whether their biological
or adoptive parents had died of the same causes by age 50.
   Among the findings:
   _If a biological mother or father died of natural causes before
age 50, this doubled the risk of premature death for their child.
However, there was no association between the deaths of adoptive
parents and their children.
   _If a biological parent died of an infection before age 50, the
mortality rate among the adoptees from infections was five times
higher than usual. The researchers said that suggests the strength
of people's immune systems is inherited.
   _Vascular disease that underlies heart trouble and stroke also
were strongly influenced by inheritance. If a biological parent
died early of this disease, the child was five times more likely
than the others to die of this cause.
   _In cancer, the situation was reversed. Those whose adoptive
parents died before 50 of cancer had a five-fold increased risk of
dying themselves of cancer. But the adoptees' cancer death risk was
not increased if the biological parents died of cancer.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Roger R. Williams of the
University of Utah said the research provided ``splendid data.''
But he said it should not be used to argue that family habits don't
contribute to heart disease or that genes never play a role in
cancer.

<HEAD>Text Of Cease-Fire Agreement Between The Sandinistas And Contras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAPOA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is an abridged version of the text
of a cease-fire agreement signed Wednesday night by Sandinista and
Contra leaders.
   It was translated from Spanish by The Associated Press.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   An agreement between the constitutional government of Nicaragua
and the Nicaraguan Resistance (Contras):
   1. To cease offensive military operations throughout the
national territory for a period of 60 days beginning April 1, 1988.
During this period will occur negotiations to achieve a definitive
cease-fire, and its effective implementation will be carried out
jointly with the other commitments contemplated (in this accord)
for the purpose of ending the war. Both parties agree to meet again
at the highest levels April 6 to continue the definitive cease-fire
negotiations.
   2. During the first 15 days, the resistance forces will locate
themselves in zones whose areas, size and modus operandi will be
mutually determined through special commissions meeting in Sapoa
beginning Monday, March 28, 1988.
   3. The Nicaraguan goverment will decree a general amnesty for
persons tried and convicted of violating public security law as
well as for ex-members of Somoza's National Guard imprisoned since
July 19, 1979.
   In the case of the former, the amnesty will be gradual... During
Holy Week, on Palm Sunday, it will begin with the release of the
first 100 prisoners.
   Later, when it has been verified that the forces of the
Nicaraguan Resistance have entered the mutually agreed upon zones,
50 percent of the prisoners will be released. The remaining 50
percent will be released at a later date at the moment when the
definitive cease-fire is signed ...
   The release of the prisoners mentioned in the second part of the
first paragraph of section three will begin with the signing of the
definitive cease-fire depending on prior decision of the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of
American States ...
   4. To guarantee food and basic supplies for the irregular forces
(the Contras), exclusively humanitarian aid will be solicited and
received ... and will be channeled through neutral organizations.
   5. The Nicaraguan government will guarantee unrestricted freedom
of expression...
   6. When the Nicaraguan Resistance Forces are concentrated in
mutually accepted zones, they will send to the national dialogue
(with the internal political opposition) as many as eight
delegates. In the national dialogue, among other topics, issues
related to military service will be treated.
   7. It is guaranteed that all individuals who for political or
any other reasons have left the country can return to Nicaragua and
incorporate themselves into the political, economic and social life
without any conditions other than those laid down in the laws of
the republic.
   They will not be tried, punished or prosecuted for any
political-military activities in which they might have engaged.
   8. The consititutional government of Nicaragua certifies that
the individuals who will have been reintegrated into normal
civilian life will be able to participate, under equal conditions
and guarantees, in the Central American parliamentry elections and
the municipal elections, on the dates scheduled for them, as well
as in nationl general elections on the dates which have been
determined in the poltical constitution.
   9. For the purpose of verifying the compliance with this
agreement, a verification commision will be formed with the
participation of ... Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo (Nicaragua's
Roman Catholic leader), and the secretary general of the OAS, his
excellency Ambassador Joao Baena Soares ...
   In addition, both parties agree to prolong to April 1, 1988, the
cessation of offensive militry operations agreed to by both parties
on March 21.

<TEXT>
   Dallas County officials say they probably
will let the chips fall where they may in the Meadow Muffin Match
Up, which could be an illegal lottery.
   About 2,000 people have bought $5 tickets for a chance to win
$1,500 on April 30 when a cow is allowed on the Coppell High School
football field.
   The field is divided into a grid, and the owner of the first
square with a cow hit will receive the prize money.
   The event is sponsored by the Coppell High School
Parent-Teacher-Student Association, and money raised will go toward
a college scholarship fund and the purchase of a school laminating
machine.
   County officials downwind from the suburb caught a whiff of the
event and said it is gambling.
   ``I don't write the laws, I just enforce them,'' said Jeff Keck,
assistant district attorney. ``I think it's got some real liability
problems.''
   But Keck said officials may ignore the event and let ticket
holders take their chances.
   ``No one is likely to file a complaint,'' Keck said.
   An official with the state attorney general's office said that
although the money is being raised for a good cause, it is still
gambling.
   But PTSA President Brenda Robertson said, ``I can't imagine
anyone being ornery enough to try to stop us from trying to help
our kids.''
   Sandra Burton, a PTSA member, said some parents thought the
event was a little off-color.
   ``I have to admit that at first I thought it was a gross idea,''
she said. ``But we all went home and thought about it ... and we
were able to see the humor in it.''
   Ms. Burton said the PTSA first considered using a horse instead
of a cow. ``But horses drop a lot,'' she said. ``And we would end
up owing the world a lot of money.''

<TEXT>
   Amid the deafening boom of live mortar
fire and the sizzling heat of a Honduran spring, American soldiers
practiced for battle but thought about going home soon.
   A Honduran artillery school in the sprawling pine-covered
mountains of south-central Honduras, was the setting Wednesday for
training exercises between American and Honduran troops.
   About 120 soldiers worked together, loading and firing mortars
and howitzers, radioing messages from the field, plotting diagrams
of make-believe enemy positions and cheering when the artillery hit
its mark a mile away.
   Officers from both countries said the training was worthwhile.
   ``We're learning to adapt our ways to different areas,'' said
Cpl. Charles Schneider, 22, of Washington, D.C.
   ``I'm learning Spanish,'' said Sgt. Scott Craig, 25, of
Charlotte, N.C.
   Col. Rene Fonseca, commander of the Honduran company taking part
in the exercises, said his soldiers do not often get a chance to
use live artillery. Money is scarce in this country, so the
exercises are U.S. funded.
   ``We don't have enough ammunition to last the whole year, so
while they're here we take advantage of the opportunity to use live
ammunition,'' he said.
   All the U.S. soldiers training at Zambrano, 25 miles north of
the capital of Tegucigalpa, are from the 82nd Airborne Division
based at Fort Bragg, N.C.
   President Reagan rushed 3,200 American soldiers to Honduras last
week after Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo said Sandinista
troops from neighboring Nicaragua had pursued U.S.-backed Contra
rebels into Honduran territory.
   The Reagan administration said the Americans were in Honduras as
an emergency training exercise meant to show support for Azcona.
   Late Wednesday, a Honduran military source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said about 300 Nicaraguan troops entered
Honduran territory in the region where Sandinista soldiers had
fought Contra rebels last week.
   ``Because of that, the state of alert continues for all combat
units of the armed forces,'' said the source.
   The location was given as the San Andres de Bocay region in
Olancho province, but no other details were available.
   Pentagon officials in Washington said earlier Wednesday that,
unless the military situation in the region changed, the U.S.
soldiers tentatively will return home early next week.
   Cpl. Rodney Brooks, 22, who took time out from artillery
practice to read letters from his fiancee in North Conway, N.H.,
said he hoped he would be home in time for his June 18 wedding.
   He said he was ``relieved, very relieved'' when he learned that
Sandinista forces had retreated last week and that truce talks
between the Sandinistas and Contras had begun in Sapoa, Nicaragua.
   ``We came down here to do what we had to do in any way, shape or
form,'' he said from behind a 105mm howitzer.
   ``But if we can keep from firing one shot and the problems still
get resolved, then that's great,'' he said.
   Some soldiers said their trip to Honduras, one of Central
America's poorest countries, had been an eye-opener.
   ``The children come running up to you for chocolate and money.
And the way they live _ it makes you feel lucky to live in a
house,'' said Spec. 4 James Holt, 20, of Washington.
   ``It makes you want to get back home so badly.''

<HEAD>U.N. General Assembly Slaps United States For PLO Eviction Attempt</HEAD>

   The only General Assembly members to vote
against a resolution condemning a U.S. attempt to close the PLO's
United Nations observer mission were Israel and the United States.
   The non-binding resolution was approved 148-2 on Wednesday, a
day after the Justice Department filed suit in federal court
seeking to close the New York City townhouse where the PLO has its
offices.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization vowed to fight the
attempted closure, mandated by an anti-terrorism law passed by
Congress last year.
   The U.N. resolution calls on the United States to obey the
international U.N. headquarters treaty, which permits foreign
missions to operate and calls for arbitration of any dispute with
the host country.
   ``What pride do you have in throwing your guests out?'' shouted
PLO envoy Zehdi Labib Terzi after the vote.
   ``Is this the message the U.S. delegation wants to bring to the
world? That guests have no respect, the United Nations has no
respect, international law has no respect?'' he asked.
   The U.S. government said it will not take any physical steps
against the PLO until the issue has been settled in court.
   ``Let me assure you, we will not disregard the summons by the
U.S. District Court,'' said Terzi. ``But we will tell the court
this is a dispute between the United Nations and the United States,
and that the only forum where such a dispute can be settled is
found in section 21 of the Headquarters agreement.''
   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein rose to denounce the PLO for, as
he put it, seeking the protection of the U.N. charter as it pursues
a goal contrary to that charter: the destruction of Israel.
   ``The PLO, since its inception, has been the principal terrorist
organization of our time. It has systematically targeted and
murdered innocent civilians,'' said Bein.
   The PLO, which has retained former U.S. Attorney General Ramsay
Clark as its counsel, has 20 days from the filing of the lawsuit on
Tuesday to respond.
   The United Nations announced it will file a brief in support of
the PLO's defense motion. It retained attorney Keith Highet, who is
also president of the American Society of International Law.
   Sixty-five American organizations and citizens filed suit on
Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan challenging the
Anti-Terrorism Act.
   They included former Beirut hostage Rev. Benjamin Weir, author
Studs Terkel and actor Ed Asner, and the American Friends Service
Committee, the Arab-American Institute and the International Jewish
Peace Union.
   The lawsuit argues that the law infringes on the constitutional
right of Americans to hear all sides of the Middle East controversy
by barring the PLO from public debate.
   A March 29 hearing date was set in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.
   Wednesday's vote was the third time the General Assembly
condemned U.S. legal attempts to close the PLO mission. The world
body also condemned the Anti-Terrorism Law last December after it
was passed by Congress, and rebuked the United States on March 2
after the United States announced that it would seek to close the
PLO mission.

   An Australian company that developed an in-vitro
fertilization technique celebrated its second anniversary with a
party attended by some of its success stories.
   Fifty-four babies and toddlers, all from the New York area,
gathered with their families at a Manhattan party Wednesday. All
were conceived through the programs of the IVF Australia company,
which has fertility clinics at United Hospital in Chester and
another in Alabama.
   ``All we see are positive pregnancy tests in ultrasound scans,''
said Dr. John J. Stangel, the program's medical director. ``We
never get to see the babies.''
   Nurses, doctors and other members of the medical team handed out
stuffed koala bears to the children, and a birthday cake was rolled
out with 168 blazing candles to represent the number of babies born
using the IVF Australia technique.
   The oldest on hand Wednesday was 16-month-old Matthew Martinez.
The youngest was 5-week-old Michael Kiddo, who slept through the
party.
   The IVF technique involves removing mature eggs from a woman's
ovary, fertilizing them with sperm in a petri dish and implanting
them in the woman's uterus.
   Multiple births are more common in such pregnancies, with
between 15 and 20 percent of IVF Australia births being twins. The
procedure costs $5,000, usually covered by medical insurance.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Witnesses in the Armenian capital of Yerevan today
said Red Army helicopters circled the skies to guard against unrest
after the government described Armenian claims to an area in
neighboring Azerbaijan as intolerable.
   Moscow dissident Valery Senderov said a correspondent for an
unofficial human rights journal had called from Yerevan to say that
helicopters were patrolling the city, but that there was no
widespread disorder reported.
   Regyen Sarkisyan, a senior editor of the Communist Party
newspaper Kommunist in Yerevan, confirmed in a telephone interview
with The Associated Press that there were helicopters overhead, but
described the city as calm.
   He said most Armenians were showing patience in awaiting
resolution of the contentious national issue.
   Armenians want the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan annexed
to Armenia because more than three-quarters of the population in
the region is Armenian.
   The annexation appeal was rejected by the party Central
Committee in early February, which triggered massive demonstrations
in the region that is smaller than the state of Delaware.
   The unrest spread to Yerevan in late February, when hundreds of
thousands of Armenians marched through the streets bearing banners
linking the Nagorno-Karabakh issue with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's social reforms.
   The Yerevan demonstrations subsided after Gorbachev appealed for
calm and promised a party review of the annexation question. But
the issue touched off rioting in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait on
Feb. 28, when at least 32 people were killed in a rampage by ethnic
extremists.
   Soviet officials reported earlier this week that 197 people were
injured in the Sumgait rioting and that more than 400 have been
arrested or charged in murders, rapes, looting and other violent
acts.
   Armenian activists claim the casualties were much higher and
predominently among Armenians at the hands of enraged Azeris, the
dominant population of Azerbaijan.
   Sarkisyan, the newspaper editor, said soldiers were deployed
around Yerevan to ensure order today, but no outbreaks of unrest
had occurred to his knowledge since a government statement on the
issue was made public Wednesday night.
   The demonstrations had subsided until early this week, when
reports in the party daily Pravda said the annexation drive had a
``clear anti-socialist spirit.'' Activists in Yerevan said about
7,000 people protested that report, and one of the journalists
whose name had been attached to it disavowed it.
   As recently as March 17, party officials in Nagorno-Karabakh
appealed for permission to join the Armenian republic.
   Activists in Yerevan had called for another show of support for
the annexation appeal with demonstrations and strikes beginning
Saturday, when a self-appointed committee of activists and
officials plans to meet and discuss a future course of action.
   Sarkisyan, a 32-year-old candidate for membership in the
Communist Party, said he supports the proposal for returning
Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, but doesn't expect the matter to be
resolved soon.
   ``I believe that some day it will be united with Armenia, but in
the nearest days I don't expect this to happen. It is a very
complicated issue, and I think most people understand that now,''
he said.
   He said he did not expect a large turnout at the demonstrations
or widespread participation in the strikes called for by activists,
although Moscow-based dissidents say they've been told thousands
plan to show their support for the Nagorno-Karabakh appeal by
taking to the streets.
   The Soviet government on Wednesday rejected as ``intolerable''
the Armenian campaign for annexation, indicating it would not bend
to the pressures brought to bear by demonstrations and strikes.
   The meeting, attended by Gorbachev, President Andrei A. Gromyko
and other senior party officials, was held after carefully
orchestrated appeals by subordinate legislative bodies in 13 Soviet
republics _ all but Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   The official Tass news agency said the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet, the nominal parliament, considered it ``intolerable when it
is attempted to resolve complicated national-territorial issues
through pressure on state authorities, in an atmosphere when
emotions and passions are whipped up.''
   The statement did not categorically deny the appeal, but
declared that such issues would be resolved on the basis of
economic concerns rather than ethnic differences.

<TEXT>
   ``Nightline'' anchor Ted Koppel has agreed to a
long-term contract that will keep him at ABC News but allow him to
produce his own prime-time programs, a newspaper reported today.
   Koppel had been working without a contract since last year, and
there was spculation he might leave ABC to start his own production
company to make a syndicated version of ``Nightline,'' according to
The New York Times.
   He has anchored the late-night program since it started in 1980
and has been linked to its success largely through his diplomatic
yet confrontational interviewing style.
   Under the new arrangement, Koppel will get similar benefits as
he has now, with ABC agreeing to broadcast ``Nightline'' five
nights a week. Koppel will be host for most, but not all of the
broadcasts.
   In addition, Koppel will get his own production company, which
will produce each year at least four hour-long news programs to air
in prime-time. ABC will pay him for the right to broadcast those
programs.
   Koppel's company also will have the right to produce television
programs that could be broadcast outside ABC, according to the
unidentified executives by the Times.
   Roone Arledge, president of ABC News, said Wednesday the deal
was agreed on but not signed. Koppel did not return several
telephone calls to his Washington office, the Times said.

<TEXT>
   A convicted former Wedtech Corp. executive, who
has confessed to stealing $1.5 million from the bankrupt defense
contractor, admitted he has not had to give back any of his illegal
earnings.
   Under cross examination by the defense at the racketeering trial
of Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and six others Wednesday, Mario
Moreno was asked about his plea bargain with federal prosecutors.
   Biaggi attorney James LaRossa got Moreno to admit he sought to
avoid a racketeering charge ``which could carry up to 20 years in
prison and forfeiting your assets.''
   ``And you told your lawyer you didn't want that, right?'' asked
LaRossa, ``and that is one of the things they negotiated and got
for you, isn't that right?''
   ``Yes,'' said Moreno, who later admitted his lawyer also got
``one of the most lenient judges'' to take his guilty plea.
   Moreno is among four ex-Wedtech officials who have admitted
bribing public officials and other state and federal crimes in a
plea bargain for leniency. All are cooperating witnesses for the
prosecution. None have yet been sentenced.
   Moreno faces a maximum 15 years in prison after pleading guilty
to federal charges of bribe conspiracy and mail fraud. He also
faces an additional seven years after pleading guilty to state
larceny and bribery charges.
   LaRossa also got Moreno to admit that ``not a penny'' of his
assets have been seized or forfeited despite his numerous guilty
pleas.
   Biaggi, his eldest son, Richard; Wedtech founder John Mariotta
and four others are charged with turning Wedtech, a Bronx defense
contractor, into a vehicle for paying millions of dollars in bribes
to obtain government no-bid contracts.
   Wedtech, currently in bankruptcy proceedings, grew from a small
machine shop into a $100-million-a-year business through a series
of no-bid contracts set aside for companies controlled by minority
group members.
   Earlier, Moreno claimed attorneys at the firm of Squadron,
Ellenoff, Plesent and Lehrer were aware of another Wedtech scheme
to make it appear the company was minority controlled in order to
qualify for no-bid contracts.
   He said the lawyers knew the agreement to sell majority control
of the stock to Mariotta, who is of Hispanic descent, was ``a
sham.''
   ``So they participated in your fraud, is what you are telling
us, right?'' asked LaRossa.
   ``Yes,'' replied Moreno after a short pause.
   Howard Squadron, a partner in the firm, later issued a statement
calling Moreno's testimony ``untrue.''
   ``Neither he nor anybody else from Wedtech advised anybody at
this firm that Mr. Mariotta had agreed not to buy shares of stock
pursuant to the purchase agreement,'' said Squadron, noting that
Moreno previously testified he and other Wedtech officials
concealed other illegal activities from the law firm and ``if there
was such an agreement with Mr. Mariotta, it too was concealed.''

   High winds and snow today buffeted mountain areas of Wyoming and
Colorado, which braced for gusts up to 80 mph and more than a foot
of snow from a fast-moving cold front.
   Strong winds blew through sections of South Dakota, California,
Washington state, the Midwest, and the East Coast. Showers and
thundershowers fell in much of the Midwest.
   A warning for heavy snow was issued for the northern mountains
of Colorado, where 8 to 14 inches was expected. The snow and winds
predicted to hit 80 mph were expected to create blizzard conditions.
   An advisory for snow and blowing snow was posted for the
mountains of southeastern Wyoming, where 4 to 8 inches was expected.
   On Wednesday, the front spawned 80 mph winds in the Northwest,
forcing Army officials to cancel military helicopter flights and
training with anti-tank missiles at the Yakima Firing Center in
central Washington.
   Up to 18 inches of snow fell Wednesday in the Cascade Range, and
a snow advisory remained in effect for the mountains.
   The high winds have been blamed for the death of a 15-year-old
Portland girl, who was struck by falling trees at a state park in
Oregon on Tuesday.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from northeastern Missouri
and southeastern Iowa across northern Illinois to northern Indiana,
and were scattered over the lower Mississippi Valley. Showers fell
over Minnesota and the lower Great Lakes region.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in the Mississippi Valley, the eastern Plains, Alabama, the lower
Great Lakes and the northern Ohio Valley; severe thunderstorms with
tornadoes possible from Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma northeastward
to the middle Mississippi Valley; rain from the northern Pacific
Coast to northwest Montana, with snow in some higher elevations;
scattered rain and snow showers in the northern and central High
Plains and strong, gusty winds in the Rockies, the High Plains and
the middle Mississippi Valley.
   Temperatures were expected to reach the 50s, 60s or 70s for most
of the nation; the 40s from the northern and central Rockies across
the northern Plains, from northern Minnesota to the upper Great
Lakes and across sections of northern New England; near 80 degrees
over the central Gulf Coast states, the Florida Peninsula and
southern West Virginia; and the 80s to near 90 degrees over the
desert Southwest and much of Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 17
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 73 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<TEXT>
   Only after Soviet television broadcast a 1{-hour
speech by Mikhail S. Gorbachev on agriculture and news on a
territorial dispute did viewers learn President Reagan will meet
their leader in Moscow in May.
   The brief announcement came about 11 p.m. Wednesday, two hours
into the news program ``Vremya,'' or Time, which has an estimated
audience of 150 million. Tass, the official news agency, announced
the summit in a one-paragraph dispatch issued more than 2{ hours
earlier.
   ``Vremya'' showed videotape of Reagan meeting Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze outside the White House earlier in
the day.
   An announcer said Reagan reported that the superpowers settled
on the dates of May 29 through June 2 for the meeting, his fourth
summit with Gorbachev and first trip to the Soviet Union.
   The five-day visit will mark the first trip to the Soviet Union
by an U.S. president since Richard Nixon's 1974 summer meeting with
Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   ``Vremya'' customarily lasts an hour or less, but its lead item
Wednesday was a long speech by Gorbachev, the Communist Party
chief, at the opening of a collective farmers congress. His
remarks, which lasted 1 hour and 40 minutes, apparently were
broadcast in their entirety.
   The evening newscast also reported that the Soviet government
rejected as ``intolerable'' a campaign by Armenian activists to
annex Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian area of
neighboring Azerbaijan.
   That campaign fueled ethnic strife that led to rioting in the
Azerbaijani city of Sumgait on Feb. 28. Officials say 32 people
died.
   State-run media had no initial comment about the summit, whose
projected centerpiece is the signing of a treaty now being
negotiated that would reduce long-range nuclear weapons on both
sides by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   Tass gave no details in its dispatch beyond the time and place
fixed for the meeting.

   A chain-smoking woman whose husband won
a court order that banned her smoking around their children says
the legal battle is over.
   ``It's all academic. I am quitting smoking today anyway,''
Elizabeth Roofeh, 41, said Wednesday after an appeals court stayed
the order. ``I was only doing it to annoy my husband.''
   She and her husband Jahanshan, a non-smoker, are divorcing. He
went to court last year claiming he'd tried for 12 years to get her
to curtail her habit, which he described as ``offensive and
detrimental to the health of the children,'' aged 6, 7, and 9.
   Mrs. Roofeh said she enrolled in an anti-smoking clinic after
her children said the legal wrangling was ``ludicrous.'' Besides,
she added, ``I'm coughing like crazy. This is killing me. I don't
think it's helping the kids either.''
   Roofeh could not be reached for comment and his attorney,
Stephen Schissell, had no comment on the stay.

<HEAD>Grenades Fired At U.S. Embassy; Warrants Suspended For Drug
Suspects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men fired rocket-propelled grenades
at the U.S. Embassy, slightly damaging the roof in an attack a
leftist guerrilla group claimed was a response to U.S. intervention
in Central America.
   No one was hurt in the Wednesday night attack in Bogota.
   Earlier in the day, the nation's Council of State ordered the
temporary suspension of arrest orders for five members of the
cocaine-trafficking Medellin cartel wanted for extradition to the
United States.
   And in Medellin on Wednesday, gunmen ambushed and killed the
security chief of a newspaper that had urged the government not to
back down in its war on drug traffickers, police said.
   The suspension of the arrest orders is almost certain to bring
an angry reaction from U.S. authorities, who have begun to question
the Colombian government's position on rounding up drug traffickers.
   The U.S. Embassy officials said the only damage from the grenade
attack on the building was to the roof, which sustained minor
damage. They said one grenade apparently hit a security fence and
exploded in the air.
   The two assailants fled in a taxi, people at a restaurant across
the street from the embassy told an Associated Press reporter.
Bogota police and the army set up roadblocks throughout the capital
in an attempt to catch the assailants.
   Anonymous callers to two television stations said the attack was
staged by the Omar Torrijos Brigade of the M-19 leftist guerrilla
group. Torrijos was Panama's military ruler when died in a 1981
plane crash.
   M-19 pamphlets found outside a Bogota radio station said the
attack was a response to U.S. pressure on Panama and U.S. troops in
Honduras.
   Washington is trying through economic sanctions to force
Torrijos' successor, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, into exile.
Noriega has been indicted in the United States on charges of
trafficking in Colombian cocaine. About 3,200 U.S. soldiers were
sent into Honduras as a show of force after Nicaraguan troops
allegedly chased Contra rebels into Honduran territory.
   In Medellin, El Colombiano newspaper security chief Jorge
Alberto Stefan Gomez was hit by five bullets fired by three men on
motorcycles as he and his family were waiting for a taxi near their
home, police said.
   Stefan's 10-month-old daughter was grazed by a bullet and in
satisfactory condition. His wife was not hurt.
   Police said they didn't know who was responsible for the
killing. The Medellin paper he worked for has urged the government
not to give in to drug traffickers, many of whom live in Medellin.
   Colombian drug traffickers have killed a justice minister, an
attorney general, 21 judges, two newspaper editors and scores of
policemen and soldiers in the last four years.
   The suspension of arrest orders for the Medellin cartel applies
to its alleged leaders: Pablo Escobar, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha and
three brothers, Jorge Luis Ochoa, Juan David Ochoa and Fabio Ochoa.
   Supreme Court Justice Samuel Buitrago, a member of the Council
of State, said the suspensions were ordered while the government
studies possible charges in Colombia against the five men.
   Meanwhile, Escobar's wife and 25 of his guards appeared
Wednesday before a judge in Medellin after a shootout at Escobar's
home near that northwest Colombian city. Escobar apparently was at
home when the shootout began Tuesday but escaped. The U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration says Escobar is among the world's
biggest cocaine traffickers.
   His wife was released by the Medellin judge, the radio network
RCN said, quoting a source with the attorney general's office.

   Most Americans believe Lt. Col. Oliver L. North
should not be pardoned before he goes on trial on charges stemming
from the Iran-Contra controversy, according to a New York Times-CBS
News poll.
   The poll found that 64 percent opposed a pardon for North before
a trial while 27 percent favored such a pardon. The party
affiliation of those interviewed by telephone for the poll did not
appear to change results, the Times reported today.
   The poll also found that a majority of Americans believe
President Reagan should not have sent U.S. troops to Honduras last
week.
   Fifty-two percent said the troops should not have been sent,
while 35 percent said they should have been and 13 percent said
they did not know, according to the poll.
   The poll, based on interviews of 1,654 people nationwide between
Friday and Tuesday, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percent.
   Americans split evenly on whether North should be pardoned if
convicted, with 43 percent for and 43 percent against.
   By a 2-to-1 margin, those surveyed said he was a ``real
patriot'' but they said by the same margin that he ``went too far
with his actions,'' the newspaper said.
   The poll also found that 53 percent of the respondents were more
concerned about the United States getting involved in a war in
Honduras than about a communist takeover in the area.
   Thirty-seven percent were more worried about a Communist
takeover, while 4 percent said the factors were equal and 2 percent
said they were worried about neither. Four percent said they did
not know.
   Forty-eight percent of those surveyed did not think the United
States should be giving military aid to the Contras while 39
percent said the aid should be given and 13 percent said they did
not know.

   A critical water shortage east of San
Francisco threatens to pit suburban homeowners against city
dwellers as officials consider the most severe water conservation
measures since a 1977 drought.
   State Water Resources Department engineers said Wednesday that
low precipitation since October means river runoffs from snow melt
will be 40 percent below normal statewide between April and July _
and even lower if spring rainfall is below average.
   East Bay Municipal Utility District reservoirs that are
half-full now could be one-quarter full by September unless there
are major storms during the next two months, officials said.
   The district board declared a ``water shortage emergency''
Tuesday and warned that as of June 1, they may ration water to
their 1.1 million customers for the first time in a decade.
   The district, however, already is divided over whether to allow
more water in warmer, drier areas such as the affluent San Ramon
Valley than in the often foggy and rainy inner-cities should
rationing becomes necessary.
   ``We are the hot weather part of the district. Our needs are
different than the cooler parts of the district,'' said Mayor
Beverly Lane of Danville, a middle-class community about 10 miles
east of Oakland.
   Utility board directors from urban Berkeley and Richmond argued
it would be unfair for the suburbs, with their sprawling lawns and
gardens, to receive an extra share.
   If a voluntary conservation plan approved by the district fails,
the agency may impose water restrictions of up to 25 percent for
homes and businesses in inland counties like Alameda and Contra
Costa from May through September.
   During the drought 11 years ago, water customers were charged up
to ten times the normal rate for excessive water use.
   San Francisco and coastal counties face possible water shortages
next year, but are in better shape than the inland counties because
they have more water sources and have received more storms.

<TEXT>
   Angry rightist leaders accused
the governing Christian Democrats of trying to steal this week's
legislative and municipal elections by manipulating returns.
   The charge of attempted fraud was made Wednesday by leaders of
the Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena. They warned that
violence could occur if the incumbents continued the alleged
attempt to rig results.
   Hours after polls closed, leaders of all the parties recognized
Arena as the big winner in Sunday's vote.
   Comments Monday by Mario Samayoa, president of the Central
Elections Council, implied Arena would have at least 30 seats in
the new 60-seat National Assembly, the unicameral legislature.
Arena had said Tuesday its projections gave it 35 seats, but the
party said Wednesday it had 31 seats guaranteed.
   The election panel, an independent body including
representatives of the three major parties, has repeatedly
postponed announcement of official nationwide results.
   Samayoa said on Wednesday the commission has received several
challenges to preliminary official results reported from various
provinces, and that final official results would be withheld until
those challenges were resolved.
   Arena founder Roberto d'Aubuisson, an ex-army major and alleged
leader of early 1980s death squads, said at the news conference,
``If they continue with this fraud that they're trying to pull off,
who knows what could happen here.''
   Leaders of the National Association of Private Enterprise, or
ANEP, called a news conference to back Arena's claim and warn
against attempts to manipulate results. They held out the
possibility of a business strike if the gathering of official
results is flawed.
   ``If there is an attempt at fraud, there could be a violent
public reaction that would endanger the institutional existence of
the country,'' said ANEP leader Miguel Angel Salaverria.
   D'Aubuisson called on the armed forces' high command to ensure
the honesty of the vote count.
   ``If they do not, the accusing finger will point to them too,''
he said.
   Guillermo Guevara Lacayo, the Christian Democratic president of
the outgoing National Assembly, denied the fraud allegations.
   ``The leaders of Arena, being the experts in psychological
warfare that they are, raised expectations with inflated early
returns,'' he told reporters.
   He said his party's figures gave Arena 27 to 28 deputies, with
25 to 26 for the Christian Democrats. Such a final tally could
leave the balance of legislative power with smaller parties.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jimmy Swaggart said he's going
out of his mind not preaching, but he expects to be back within
three months and urged his followers to ignore ``innuendos that are
flying like confetti.''
   ``This ministry is not going down, it's not ever faltering,''
Swaggart told a congregation at the Family Worship Center at the
Jimmy Swaggart Ministries here Wednesday night.
   On Monday, the 250-member General Presbytery of the Assemblies
of God church plans to decide the fate of Swaggart, who tearfully
confessed on the pulpit Feb. 21 that he had sinned. He has been
following a three-month suspension recommended by state church
leaders.
   The Executive Presbytery of the church met soon afterward in
Springfield, Mo., and sent a harsher recommendation back to the
state council, calling for a year's suspension from the pulpit.
   But after meeting again, the state council voted to return its
original recommendation to the executive council of the church, the
nation's largest Pentecostal denomination. A final decision will be
made by the General Presbytery.
   Swaggart, who occasionally addresses his old congregation at
services conducted by his assistant pastor, the Rev. Jim Rentz,
indicated on Wednesday that he expects the presbyters to approve
the three-month suspension.
   He told about 400 congregants that he was going out of his mind
away from his pulpit, but ``when I'm back in the pulpit on May 22,
I'll be back in my mind.''
   Swaggart urged the congregation ignore ``innuendos that are
flying like confetti'' and said he believes that God is going to
help his ministry ``touch the world like it's never been touched
before.''
   The Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, whose television broadcasts reach
several countries, took in an estimated $150 million in 1986.
   Church officials have confirmed that Swaggart, one of the
nation's most popular television evangelists, was photographed with
a known prostitute outside a New Orleans area motel last October. A
woman who claimed she was that prostitute said Swaggart paid her to
perform pornographic acts.
   Also Wednesday, a state district court jury in Texas held that a
radio station owned by the Swaggart organization owes $28,000 in
real estate taxes, instead of the $64,043 claimed by the city of
Shenandoah.
   The jury voted 10-2 Wednesday that the ministries should pay the
smaller amount because only half of the building was a church and
the other real estate and leased property. The ministry had claimed
the radio station qualifies as a place of worship, and therefore
was tax exempt.

<TEXT>
   Journalists and white civil
rights activists held demonstrations in downtown Johannesburg today
to protest the government's closure of an anti-apartheid newspaper.
   The latest edition of the New Nation, a black-oriented weekly
published by the Roman Catholic Church, was to have gone on sale
today.
   But on Tuesday, Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha ordered the
paper shut down for 12 weeks, saying it had published ``subversive
propaganda'' in violation of state-of-emergency censorship
regulations.
   More than 30 journalists from the New Nation, the liberal Weekly
Mail, and The Star, the country's largest-selling daily, held up
placards at busy downtown intersections during the morning rush
hour.
   ``Hands off the press,'' read one placard. Another asked,
``Who's next?'' on one side, and answered, ``You're next.'' on the
other.
   White women from the Black Sash civil rights group held a
similar demonstration outside the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
Their placards read: ``Press in chains'' and ``Free New Nation.''
   The Weekly Mail is among six other anti-apartheid publications
notified by Botha that they face possible closure or appointment of
an in-house censor if they continue carrying material that
dissatisfies the minister.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   In other developments:
   _Administrators at the University of the North, a college for
blacks in Transvaal province, today announced that student
dormitories have been closed indefinitely because of disruptions
and vandalism on campus. The university's rector, P.C. Mokgokong,
said the trouble began after politically oriented boycotts of
classes Friday and Monday.
   When classes resumed Tuesday, the rector said, there was an
upsurge of ``anti-social and criminal conduct'' he blamed on
militant students.
   _Police said a 23-year-old female constable was shot and killed
Wednesday night while sitting in a car with her boyfriend near the
port city of Durban. Police said the constable, of Indian descent,
was shot by a black assailant after another had smashed the car
window with a brick.

<TEXT>
   A renowned caviar expert and a Miami roe dealer are
accused of importing $1 million worth of Iranian caviar in
violation of a presidential trade embargo with that Middle Eastern
nation.
   George Stein, 49, a wholesaler and author of ``Caviar! Caviar!
Caviar!'' and Patrick Bachelier, 32, a caviar dealer, are charged
with violating the Oct. 29, 1987, ban on Iranian imports, said U.S.
Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan.
   ``I'm innocent,'' Bachelier told The Associated Press Wednesday.
``It's a mistake.'' Telephone calls to Stein's wholesale company
went unanswered.
   If convicted as charged, the two could face up to 16 years in
prison and $150,000 in fines, Sheehan said when the agency
announced its case Wednesday.
   The fish-egg probe began last December when customs officials
received a tip about illegal Iranian caviar, Sheehan said. Customs
agents believe that Bachelier sent Iranian caviar to Europe, where
the shipments were disguised as Soviet caviar and then flown to
Miami.
   ``The caviar was in fact falsely labeled in Western Europe in
order to circumvent the embargo,'' Sheehan said.
   ``After the cavier was released by customs, Bachelier would
transfer the caviar into Iranian tins, which he had imported
separately,'' said Sheehan.
   Customs agents followed a one-ton shipment from Miami to New
York before search warrants were served March 15, Sheehan said.
   The search netted 1,400 pounds of caviar worth $400,000 at
Caspian Caviar Co., 1,000 pounds of caviar worth $400,000 at
Stein's firm, Iron Gate Caviar Co., and 1,000 pounds of caviar
worth $200,000 at Epicurean International Inc., a Rockville, Md.,

   General Motors Corp. is recalling about 4,900
1988 Chevrolet Corvettes to fix defective wheel welds that could
cause the wheel center to separate from the rim during braking or
cornering.
   The automaker said Wednesday it is also recalling about 460 1987
GMC and Chevrolet full-size vans to correct fuel tank filler pipes
that could cause fuel to leak during refueling or turning.
   No accidents or injuries have been linked to either problem, GM
said. Vehicle owners are being notified of the recall by dealers,
who will correct the problems at no charge, the company said.
   The Corvettes, all equipped with 17-inch wheels, may be missing
a weld on some wheels, GM said. The condition could result in
partial loss of steering control and a sudden changed in vehicle
direction, the automaker said.

<TEXT>
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, almost
certain to become Mexico's next president, is promising a
fraud-free election in the state that allegedly was a hotbed of
bogus balloting two years ago.
   ``I come with the firm decision to respect the will of the
people of Chihuahua,'' he said at the outset of his five-day
campaign swing through the northern border state of Chihuahua, the
largest of Mexico's 31 states.
   The trip that concludes Friday is being watched closely
throughout Mexico.
   ``The Chihuahua Case'' has become shorthand for alleged fraud
that took place during state and local elections in 1986. At that
time, Salinas de Gortari's Institutional Revolutionary Party dealt
a major setback to its rival National Action Party, which had won
an unprecedented victory in Chihuahua three years earlier.
   The governing party never has lost a presidential election or a
gubernatorial race since its inception in 1929.
   As the party's candidate, Salinas de Gortari is virtually
certain to win a six-year term on Dec. 1 and succeed President
Miguel de la Madrid.
   ``I come here with you to outline the strong commitment to
govern with absolute respect for democracy,'' Salinas de Gortari
said during his Chihuahua campaign. ``Of course we are going to
war; that's why we come to Chihuahua _ to win.''
   On Tuesday, Salinas de Gortari stopped in the southern towns of
Parral, Camargo and Delicias before returning to the state capital,
the city of Chihuahua. All were won by National Action in 1983 and
regained by the Institutional Revolutionary Party party in 1986.
   A campaign official, who asked not to be named, said crowds of
more than 5,000 people in those towns were considered a major
achievement.
   The conservative National Action Party won seven mayoralties in
1983, including the state capital and Ciudad Juarez on the border
with El Paso, Texas. It predicted an even greater victory three
years later, but Salinas de Gortari's party won 65 of 67
mayoralties, the governorship and all 14 state legislative posts at
stake.
   It insisted throughout that the vote was fair.

   Government troops moving toward rebel-held Nasir town in the
southern upper Nile region found the bodies of 250 rebels killed
from shelling, according to the Wednesday statement.
   It said that at the outskirts of Nasir, the soldiers killed 45
other rebels. Two government troops were killed and eight wounded

   It did not say when the operation took place.
   In other clashes, the statement said soldiers killed 19 rebels
in an army attack Saturday on the rebels' Bekwy camp, near Mundari
town in the Equatoria region.
   In another operation near the border with Zaire, government and
rebel troops fought Saturday and a number of rebels were killed and
wounded. The statement had no casualty numbers.
   The rebels began their insurrection in 1983 and are demanding
more autonomy and administrative and economic reforms.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Orders Meese ``Hands Off'' in FBI Harassment Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says Attorney General Edwin Meese
and the head of the Justice Department's civil rights division
cannot take part in the department's criminal investigation of
alleged harassment of a black FBI agent.
   Meese and Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds
are parties to a civil lawsuit in Washington, D.C., alleging racial
harrassment by white FBI agents against agent Donald Rochon.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Grady said Wednesday he wants a
``Chinese wall'' between the Justice Department attorneys handling
the criminal investigation and Meese and Reynolds.
   Grady suspended a grand jury investigation in Chicago until
government lawyers file a statement agreeing to abide by the order
barring Meese and Reynolds from having access to the criminal file.
   ``The grand jury, the court and the public have a right to know
that the grand jury proceedings are in the hands of persons who
have no apparent interest other than to ascertain the truth,''
Grady said in response to a request by Rochon's attorney.
   Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland said late Wednesday
that the department had just become aware of Grady's ruling and it
would have to be reviewed before there was any comment.
   Rochon, 37, now assigned to Philadelphia, filed suit Nov. 5 in
Washington against the FBI and the Justice Department, accusing
white fellow agents in Chicago and Omaha, Neb., of racial
harassment and threats of death and mutilation against him or
sexual assault against his wife, Susan, who is white. They are now
separated.
   The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has upheld
Rochon's racial discrimination allegations in connection with his
stay in Omaha in 1983 and 1984.
   ``Supervisory and high-level officials of the FBI never
confronted, stopped, investigated or even took seriously the
sometimes daily racial degradation and the blatantly discriminatory
employment actions,'' Rochon's lawsuit contended.
   The Justice Department initiated the grand jury investigation
after Rochon's suit was filed.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee also has conducted inquiries into
Rochon's allegations.
   Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, an attorney for Rochon's former
girlfriend, Rosemary Coleman Peszko, said Wednesday the woman was
pressured by FBI agents to make false statements about Rochon.
   Ms. Peszko was interrogated for 20 hours over a three-day period
earlier this month regarding her relationship with Rochon, attorney
Stefan Presser said.
   Ms. Peszko said in an affidavit the FBI took advantage of her
emotional state after a lovers' quarrel and pressured her to make
statements she feared were inaccurate. She said she did not want
those statements used against Rochon.
   ``They wanted me to sign statements they prepared, but I
refused,'' she said. ``I did not and do not intend to hurt Don,
whom I love, and I was misled by the FBI's frequently saying that
all they wanted to do was help Don by my saying what they wanted to
hear.''
   ``I was so tired, hungry and upset, I do not know what I told
them or whether what they wrote down is accurate,'' she said.
``They were often suggesting things and leading me in certain
directions, and much of what is in the statements they have may
well be inaccurate.''
   Two FBI agents from Philadelphia apparently tried to persuade
Ms. Peszko to say that Rochon first hit her during an argument
March 4 at an apartment they shared in Pennsauken, N.J., then broke
his own nose to convince investigators both had been acting
violently, Presser said.
   Rochon and Ms. Peszko filed simple assault charges against each
other in Camden County, N.J., then dropped them.
   The FBI said in a statement that the questioning followed normal
procedures taken any time allegations of impropriety or criminal
wrongdoing are leveled against an FBI employee.

   An organization of 25 Latin American
nations will hold an emergency meeting Monday to discuss the crisis
in Panama, the group said.
   The meeting of the Latin American Economic System was requested
by Panama.
   Panama's ambassador to Venezuela, Marcel Salamin, said Wednesday
that economic sanctions against his country by the United States
constitute an ``economic and financial aggression.''
   Panama is in the throes of a general strike aimed at ousting
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the chief of the nation's defense
forces and the power behind the government.
   The United States is using economic pressure to help oust
Noriega, withholding payments for use of the Panama Canal and
freezing Panamanian accounts in U.S. banks.
   The Caracas-based Latin American Economic System was founded in
1975 as a forum for the Latin American countries to debate their
economic relations with the U.S. and the industrialized nations.

   Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega is
trying to arrange through a U.S. arms dealer for the immediate
delivery of 5,000 semi-automatic pistols to his military forces,
according to a secret document.
   Coupled with the reported acquisition of large quantities of
weapons from Cuba in recent days, the proposed purchase of the
pistols indicates that Noriega may be intent on using force to
remain in power, U.S. officials said Wednesday.
   A proposal by the U.S. dealer promises delivery of an additional
25,000 pistols at the rate of 2,000 a month. A Panamanian Defense
Force major who defected last Friday said over the weekend that
Cuba recently had provided Panama with 94,000 pounds of weapons,
including large numbers of AK-47 rifles.
   A general strike protesting Noriega's continued rule has left
the country virtually paralyzed, but Noriega has given no sign that
he intends to step down as commander of the Defense Forces.
   The dealer which is arranging for the export of the Belgian-made
Browning 9mm pistols is AmeriChina Global Management Group of
Appleton, Wis.
   A copy of the proposed transaction, marked ``urgent'' and
``confidential'' was provided to The Associated Press by Panamanian
Ambassador Juan B. Sosa. He was informed of the possible
transaction last Saturday by AmeriChina President Leo Wanta.
   Sosa said Wanta discussed the deal with him unaware that Sosa
had broken with Noriega almost a month ago and has remained loyal
to ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle. At Sosa's request, Wanta
sent him a telecopy of the proposed deal, which was addressed to
Noriega and to his chief of Ordnance Services, Lt. Col. Eugenio
Corro. The arms package is worth more than $10 million.
   State Department officials said there was no legal way the U.S.
government could block the transaction because the pistols are not
of U.S. origin.
   But they expressed keen interest in a reference at the bottom of
proposal to an apparent request by the Panamanian military for M-16
rifles. The reference asked whether Panama had reached any decision
on the ``procurement-delivery'' of the M-16's.
   Any such request would require U.S. approval and would be
rejected, said the State Department officials, insisting on
anonymity.
   The M-16 is manufactured by Colt Industries, based in New York
City. A Colt official, who asked not to be identified, said Colt
would never export the M-16 without U.S. government approval.
   The State Department officials said they had no record of any
company by the name of AmeriChina. They said all companies that
manufacture or export weapons must register with the government and
that failure to do so carries stiff penalties.
   Reached by telephone at his Wisconsin office, Wanta asked how
the AP had obtained a copy of his memo to Noriega and was indignant
when he was told of Sosa's role.
   ``You tell Sosa he will have a lot of explaining to do in about
12 minutes,'' Wanta said. He then hung up.
   Sosa said that in his conversation last Saturday with Wanta, the
arms dealer had asked for Panama's military attache but Sosa took
the call himself because the attache no longer shows up at the
embassy.
   Sosa said he felt it was his duty to make the proposed deal
public because of the possibility that the weapons might be used
against the Panamanian people.
   The pistols are to be sent to Panama from Antwerp, Belgium, the
country where the weapon was originally commissioned more than 50
years ago.
   The weapons are described as ``high-power'' with fixed sights.
The price listed is $398 each.
   The delivery schedule calls for shipment of 5,000 of the pistols
immediately and an additional 2,000 units per month thereafter
``until 25,000 units are delivered.''
   There are an estimated 10,000 to 11,000 members of Panama's
Defense Forces. They are supplemented by undisclosed numbers of
paramilitary forces and militia.

   The Soviet Union today launched a satellite with
supplies for the Mir space station, whose crew is trying to set a
record for time in orbit, Tass reported.
   The official news agency said the Progress-35 cargo satellite
was carrying food and other supplies, but it did not provide
details. Data transmitted from space indicated the satellite was
functioning normally, Tass said.
   It was the second supply mission since cosmonauts Vladimir Titov
and Musa Manarov blasted off Dec. 21 to replace Yuri Romanenko and
Alexander Alexandrov on the Mir spacecraft.
   Romanenko had spent 326 days in space and thus holds the record
for the longest manned space mission. Soviet space officials say
Titov and Manarov will stay aboard the Mir for a year in an effort
to break Romanenko's record.
   The account of the launch did not say when the link between the
Mir and the cargo spacecraft was expected.

   Israeli warplanes divebombed Palestinian
guerrilla bases on the outskirts of this southern port city today
for the second day, killing nine people and wounding five, police
said.
   A police spokesman said six Israeli fighter-bombers hit the
bases six times in 55 minutes with 30 rockets and bombs, starting
at 1 p.m.
   The bases were manned by Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council
and the Moscow-oriented Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, police said.
   It was the third Israeli strike against Palestinian bases in
Lebanon in a week and the fifth this year. Forty-seven people have
been killed and 6 wounded in Israeli air strikes on guerrilla bases
in Lebanon this year.
   An Israeli army statement identified the targets as buildings
used by the guerrillas to store weapons and equipment. The
statement said Israeli pilots returned safely and reported accurate
hits on the targets.
   Smoke and dust engulfed the villages of Bekasta, Majdelyoun,
Saliyeh and Abra after the raids, and ambulances raced to the
scene. All but Abra had been bombed by Israeli jets Wednesday.
   A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity under
standing regulations, said guerrillas sealed off the villages on
the southern and eastern edges of Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   The villages were once populated by Christians. But they fled in
April 1985 when leftist Moslem militiamen drove right-wing
Christian irregulars, allied with the Israelis, out of the region.
   Police said seven people were killed and 15 wounded when 12
Israeli jet fighters raided six Palestinian guerrilla bases in the
Sidon region in Wednesday's attack.
   Five were manned by Abu Nidal's fighters and one by the
Moscow-oriented Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The front, led by Nayef Hawatmeh, is part of Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, broke away from
the PLO in 1974 to found his own group. He tops the list of
terrorists wanted by the United States and Western European
countries.
   Abu Nidal's group, in a statement issued after Wednesday's
raids, threatened to ``severely strike back against the Zionist
enemy's arrogance and barbarism ... at the right time and place.''

<HEAD>Study Shows Poor Pay Greater Part of Income on Sales and Excise
Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A four-member family earning $31,000 a year
pays three times as much of its income in state sales and excise
taxes as does one making over $612,000, a private study reported
today.
   The share of earnings soaked up by those taxes is almost five
times as large for the poorest families _ those making less than
$8,600 _ as it is for the richest, according to a report by
Citizens for Tax Justice. This happens because the taxes are
applied at a flat rate regardless of income.
   In 23 states, the disparity is even worse than the national
average. The poor in South Dakota and Mississippi pay about seven
times as much of their earnings in sales and excise taxes as do the
rich; in Tennessee, Alabama and Louisiana, almost six times as much.
   The study focused on general sales taxes and on excise taxes,
chiefly those on gasoline and tobacco. It concluded that:
   _The poorest 20 percent of four-member families, averaging
income of $8,581, paid 5.4 percent of their earnings in sales and
excise taxes last year.
   _The second one-fifth, averaging $20,535, paid 3.9 percent.
   _The third, averaging $31,497, paid 3.3 percent.
   _The fourth, averaging $44,910, paid 2.9 percent.
   _The highest-earning one-fifth, averaging $66,912, paid 2.5
percent.
   _The top-earning 5 percent, averaging $187,316, paid 1.6 percent.
   _Four-member families averaging $612,122 a year _ the richest
0.7 percent of Americans _ paid 1.1 percent of their incomes for
sales and excise taxes.
   Citizens for Tax Justice is a Washington-based research
organization that is financed by organized labor and several
liberal social groups. The organization considers income taxes more
equitable than consumption taxes, including excise and sales taxes.
   Income taxes generally take a bigger bite of each dollar as
income rises and, thus, fall more heavily on upper-income Americans.
   ``By relying on nickel-and-dime sales taxes, state governments
across the country have quietly heaped an onerous burden on their
poorest citizens,'' Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for
Tax Justice, said in releasing the study. ``The less you make, the
worse you do _ especially in states with heavy taxes on food,
utilities, tobacco and fuels.''
   The ultimate solution, he said, is for states to rely less on
sales taxes and more on income taxes. In the meantime, McIntyre
added, sales taxes can be made less onerous by extending rebates to
the poor and applying the levies disproportionately to services
that are generally used by the well-to-do, such as club memberships
and home-improvement services.
   The study concluded that the 10 states with relatively low tax
burdens on the poor have considerably more money available for
public services than do the 10 whose sales taxes on the poor are
highest.
   ``Taxing the poor heavily is both cruel and inefficient,'' said
McIntyre. ``It doesn't produce much in the way of revenues because
the poor don't make very much money.''
   Sixteen states still fully tax food; over 22 percent of all food
purchases in the United States are taxed. In fact, the study found,
the 10 states with the most onerous sales taxes on the poor all tax
food. They are: Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee, South Dakota, Virginia and
Hawaii.
   The poor spend 6.2 percent of income on electrical bills, more
than double the rate of the middle-income family. But that
middle-income family pays three times as big a share for
electricity as do the rich, the study found.
   The portion of the $600,000-a-year family's income spent for tax
on take-home beer is only 15 percent of the $8,600 family's share.
On cigarettes, the upper-income family's share is 1 percent of the
low-income family's; on gasoline, 4 percent; on fresh flowers, 98
percent; on legal fees, 100 percent; jewelry, 259 percent; wine for
home consumption, 324 percent, and out-of-town lodging, 613 percent.
   The study found that only six states have set up a system of tax
credits to reduce the sales-tax burden on the poor. In only one
state, New Mexico, would the credit offset as much as half the
burden.
   The six states and the theoretical reduction for the poor, if
all the poor applied for the credit: New Mexico, 64 percent;
Kansas, 35 percent; Vermont, 26 percent; Idaho, 22 percent; Hawaii,
17 percent, and North Carolina, 7 percent.

   Democrat Richard Gephardt will become the next casualty of the
1988 presidential campaign if he fails to win the Michigan caucuses
on Saturday, a campaign aide said today, as the other candidates
took aim across party lines.
   Republican Bob Dole criticized Democrat Michael Dukakis, and
Democrats Albert Gore Jr. and Jesse Jackson attacked GOP
front-runner George Bush in a preview of what the fall campaign
might bring.
   Gephardt insisted publicly that no decisions had been made, but
an aide said the Missouri congressman would leave the presidential
race early next week in time to file for re-election to his House
seat by the Tuesday deadline.
   ``He will be out if he doesn't win in Michigan,'' said the aide,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Gephardt is running third in the polls in Michigan behind
Dukakis and Jackson.
   Although the primary season is far from over, the candidates
appeared to be shifting their attention toward the general-election
confrontation in November between their two parties. After
Michigan, both parties hold primaries in Connecticut on Tuesday.
   Heading into this round of contests, the Democrats have largely
avoided the bitter battles among themselves that were typical of
the Super Tuesday campaign earlier this month. But there's still
some infighting afoot.
   Gephardt has sounded a drumbeat of attacks against Dukakis in
recent days, accusing him of inconsistency on trade issues. He was
expected to bring up the subject again today in an economic address.
   In Michigan, the Missouri congressman has been courting workers,
especially those in the auto industry, with his
get-tough-on-foreigners trade message.
   Gore, without mentioning Gephardt by name, took a swipe at him
for that. ``It would be easy to blame all our problems on
foreigners,'' he told the Wisconsin Legislature.
   The Tennessee senator is badly in need of a Northern victory,
and his political director, Larry Harrington, said Wisconsin may be
the place for Gore to ``punch through.''
   Also making a big push in Wisconsin is Sen. Paul Simon, whose
home-state victory in Illinois last week revived his bid.
   ``If I can win Wisconsin, two weeks later is New York. ... That
would give me a lift and put me back in the ball game in a major
way,'' Simon told the Green Bay Press-Gazette.
   Jackson was crisscrossing Michigan, where polls have indicated
he is running second to Dukakis. Other candidates may have more
money, Jackson told auto workers, but he has a richer message.
   ``I've been ... walking the assembly line, standing with and
fighting for the workers,'' he said. ``I don't have the big engine,
but I know the roads a lot better.''
   That was about the closest Jackson came to criticizing his
Democratic opponents. Instead, he took the vice president to task,
vowing to ``keep on challenging him on the leadership gap.''
   Gore, too, delivered a forceful attack on Bush, saying the vice
president ``wants another chance to cut taxes for the rich.'' He
also questioned Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``It's not as if he were a neophyte sitting in the White House
with no basis of judgment on the arms-for-hostages swap,'' Gore
said of Bush.
   In a CBS-New York Times poll, 51 percent said yes when asked if
Bush was hiding something the public ought to know about the
Iran-Contra affair; 28 percent said no and 21 percent said they
didn't know. The margin of error was 3 points, CBS said Wednesday
night.
   Bush got kinder treatment at the hands of Dole, now a rival in
name only. Bush holds an overwhelming lead in delegates, and the
Kansas senator has abandoned his once-bitter attacks on the vice
president.
   Dole, in a Washington speech on Wednesday, accused the
Democratic contenders of a ``failure of nerve as well as a failure
of vision'' in dealing with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government.
   The Kansas senator singled out Dukakis for the sharpest
criticism, saying: ``He says that this country ... has no choice
but to tolerate the existence of Soviet client states wherever
subversion might install them.''
   Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach retorted: ``I guess Bob Dole is
taking after Michael Dukakis because he's accomplishing what Bob
Dole can't _ beating George Bush in the polls.''
   A poll published Wednesday by the Hartford Courant suggested
Bush was favored by 64 percent of likely GOP voters in Connecticut,
while Dole was the choice of just 20 percent. Dole, campaigning in
Connecticut, brushed that off.
   ``I don't pay any attention to polls. They said I was going to
win in New Hampshire,'' he said.
   Bush, whose father was a U.S. senator from Connecticut, further
consolidated his strength in the state with the endorsement of GOP
state chairman Robert S. Poliner.
   Dukakis, was raising money in California today, with a new
endorsement of his own to point to: the popular Sen. Bill Bradley
of New Jersey. The New Jersey senator, who is sometimes faulted for
a less-than-dynamic speaking style, used the occasion to poke a
little fun at both himself and Dukakis.
   ``It has been said of Michael Dukakis that he is dull, a charge
with which I am not unfamiliar,'' Bradley said Wednesday. ``But
governance is not an amusement park.''

<TEXT>
   A drawbridge that got stuck in the up
position, snarling traffic for 20 miles and stranding hundreds of
motorists, was fixed today after blocking auto travel to most of
the Keys, police said.
   ``The bridge just opened,'' Florida Highway Patrol duty officer
Terri Magee said at 8:30 a.m.
   Rush-hour traffic on the Snake Creek Bridge is normally heavy,
she said. That, coupled with the hundreds of motorists stranded
when the bridge broke down Wednesday, means traffic jams will
continue for a while, she said.
   The 300-foot bridge is about 30 miles down the 135-mile chain of
islands, and is the only road link between the southern Keys and
those to the north and the mainland.
   ``I think every tourist in Monroe County has called us
tonight,'' Highway Patrol duty officer Gregory Harris said as crews
worked to fix the bridge. ``Apparently the bridge was raising ...
most likely for a boat. I guess it just went up too far or the wind
caught it and the gears are stuck in the upright position.''
   Stranded motorists were sheltered for the night in hotels and in
schools. Some drivers simply left their cars in the traffic jam and
walked to nearby bars or restaurants.
   ``We're completely swamped in here and it's wall-to-wall people
outside,'' said Erik Jorgensen, whose Erik's Floating Restaurant is
just south of the bridge. ``Some are impatient, but mostly they're
saying `Give me another beer.'''
   Jorgensen said he unfolded every lawn chair he owned and was
serving in the parking lot.
   Plantation Elementary School teacher Barbara Young said about 25
children were spending the night at the building because a bus
taking about 45 of them home was stuck on the south side of the
bridge.
   Some students stayed at the home of friends who live on the
south side, and others were fetched home by boat, she said.
   The Florida Keys are linked by the Overseas Highway. Harris said
the last time he could remember a similar incident was in 1981.

   Seven mine employees were
acquitted today of homicide charges arising from South Africa's
worst gold mine disaster, an underground fire that killed 177 men.
   Six of the defendants who held supervisory positions at the
Kinross gold mine in 1986 also were acquitted on all lesser
charges. A welder, Frederick Viviers, pleaded guilty to two charges
of violating mining regulations and was fined $50.
   The fire broke out at Kinross on Sept. 16, 1986, in a tunnel
that had been sprayed six years earlier with a polyurethene foam to
prevent corrosion.
   Experts said toxic fumes from the foam contributed to the high
death toll.
   During the trial, an expert witness for the General Union Mining
Corp., which owns Kinross, testified that the company had ordered a
fire-retardant form and had been supplied with the wrong variety.
   Magistrate J.W. Pieterse, who presided at the trial in the
Transvaal province town of Witbank near Kinross, accepted this
testimony. He said the mine staff could not be held responsible
because they had not known they were supplied with the wrong kind
of foam.

<TEXT>
   Nicaragua has asked the
International Court of Justice for an inquiry into alleged Honduran
armed incursions into Sandinista territory, a court spokesman said
today.
   The Sandinistas also want a U.N. observer force to monitor the
border between the two countries, the spokesman said.
   The request, filed with the court Monday, was disclosed as the
Sandinistas and the U.S.-backed Contral rebel forces trying to
overthrow the Nicaraguan government agreed to a 60-day cease-fire
to begin April 1.
   The world court, based in The Hague, is the judicial branch of
the United Nations.
   The Nicaraguan gambit revives a case suspended in August as a
result of the Central American peace plan. The plan was signed by
the presidents of Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and
Guatemala.
   Tensions on the Nicaraguan-Honduran border were reportedly
abating, despite a Honduran military report Wednesday that small
numbers of Nicaraguan troops have entered Honduran territory in the
San Andres de Bocay region in Olancho province. Sandinista soldiers
fought Contra rebels in the region last week.
   The approximately 3,200 U.S. troops sent to Honduras last week
were to be flown back to their bases in the United States early
next week, the Pentagon said.
   The U.S. troops were dispatched to Honduras after Honduras
accused the Nicaraguan army of incursions into Honduran territory
earlier this month. The Pentagon said at the time of the airlift
that the American troops were in Honduras on a training mission.
   The Sandinstas have denied crossing the Honduran border in their
skirmishes with the Contras and have in turn accused Honduran
troops of crossing the Nicaraguan border to support the rebels.
   The Nicaraguan Embassy here claimed today that ``several Contra
incursions with Honduran support'' occurred in the course of March.
   In its request, Nicaragua asked the court to launch ``an inquiry
... investigating the recent incidents in the Bocay (border) region
and the causes of such incidents.''
   And it requested ``the creation of a group of observers by the
appropriate organ of the United Nations to monitor incidents at the
border region.''
   The request is part of an ongoing case against Honduras that
Nicaragua brought before the court 18 months ago.
   Nicaragua originally sought a court ruling ordering Honduras to
halt alleged support for the Contras. Managua has repeatedly
claimed that the Contras are operating from bases inside Honduras.
Honduras has not denied that there are Contra bases on its
territory but has said it is powerless to halt the rebel activities.
   No date has been set for hearings on Nicaragua's request.

<TEXT>
   Actress Jane Fonda was both cheered and
booed for her work against the Vietnam War during a hearing on
whether to snub her when she visits to shoot scenes for a movie.
   About 250 people attended Wednesday night's public hearing at
Chicopee City Hall, where the state commissioner of veterans
service, John Halachis, called an end to the arguments over Fonda.
   ``Arguing about the appropriateness of this movie will not heal
one wound ... or provide jobs for one man or woman,'' Halachis said.
   Applause, cheers and whistles punctuated the remarks of Bud
Gagnon, head of veterans services for Chicopee, who referred to
Fonda's 1972 trip to Hanoi during the Vietnam War.
   ``She did make the statement she was sorry (and that) people
misunderstood her intentions. It was our fault we misunderstood
her. What was Jane Fonda's punishment? Enormous wealth! Jane Fonda
is not welcome in Chicopee!'' Gagnon said.
   Fonda's planned presence this summer has stirred strong passions
in the mill city of 55,112 people along the Connecticut River
outside Springfield.
   The movie, ``Union Street,'' is about an illiterate mill worker.
Fonda is to play a woman who teaches the man to read.
   Veterans from out of state have come to town to lend Fonda their
support, and even former U.S. House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip''
O'Neill Jr. issued a statement praising her for her anti-war
activism.
   But several veterans' groups throughout western Massachusetts
have voiced their displeasure because of her trip to Hanoi. At the
urging of local veterans, aldermen in nearby Holyoke voted 11-4 on
Feb. 2 to consider Fonda a ``persona non grata'' if she comes to
their city to work.
   Chicopee aldermen called Wednesday's hearing on a request that
they pass a resolution similar to the one in Holyoke.
   The Holyoke aldermen, however, said they would not try to block
the shooting of the movie. And the mayors of Holyoke and Chicopee
have said they support the veterans' right to protest Fonda's visit
as well as her right to set foot in their communities.
   Charles Liteky, a Medal of Honor recipient, came from Washington
to speak on behalf of Fonda.
   ``I'm very grateful for those who protested against the U.S.
involvement in Vietnam. Had they not done that, I think we would
have had more people die,'' said the former chaplain, whose trip
was paid by a group of Vietnam veterans who are now peace activists.
   Before the hearing, Vietnam veteran Delfo Barabani Jr. said a
dozen veterans' groups in the city, representing hundreds of
people, unanimously approved a resolution opposing Fonda's visit.
``She's got a right to her opinions. I've got a right to mine. This
is my town. I don't feel particularly comfortable with her coming
here.''

<TEXT>
   This impoverished Mississippi River
city has no money today, and may have no choice but to seek
protection in bankruptcy court, says an attorney who garnished all
of the city's funds to pay part of a $3.4 million judgment.
   ``They can file a petition for bankruptcy with the federal
court, and a trustee can be appointed,'' said Clyde Kuehn, attorney
for a city jail inmate who suffered permanent brain damage when he
was beaten by another prisoner.
   East St. Louis Treasurer Charlotte Moore said there was about
$800,000 in city accounts when the documents were served Wednesday.
She said about $85,000 in payroll and vendor checks are outstanding
and apparently cannot be cashed.
   ``My real interest right now is payroll. That's critical,'' said
Alderman Melvin Frierson. ``It's bad that it happened, but it was a
bad situation that caused the lawsuit, too.''
   The city's next pay day is March 30.
   Mayor Carl E. Officer declined comment.
   The judgment _ now about $4 million with interest _ was awarded
in 1985 to Walter DeBow, a Granite City man who suffered permanent
brain damage in a beating in the East St. Louis jail in January
1984.
   DeBow was arrested for driving with an open bottle of malt
liquor. He was placed in a cell with a man who was being held on
misdemeanor charges but had a history of violent crime. Kuehn said
the man beat DeBow so severely that he suffered permanent brain
damage and will require medical care for the rest of his life.
   In November, the Illinois Supreme Court ordered the city to pay
the judgment, clearing the way for Kuehn and the DeBow family to
seize the city's bank accounts by filing the garnishment documents.
   The garnishment affected city funds held in banks, and fines and
taxes collected by St. Clair County.
   ``As far as the people of East St. Louis are concerned, this
isn't going to hurt the citizens any more than they already are,''
Kuehn said. ``They already don't get their trash picked up. They
already have a fire department and police department that isn't
properly equipped.
   ``Perhaps if they go into bankruptcy and a trustee is appointed
and starts making decisions, the people of the city will even be
better off,'' Kuehn said.

<HEAD>Legislators: $2.2 Billion Anti-Drug Bill Turns Up Heat in Drug War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $2.4 billion ``self-funding'' anti-drug bill
is ``the beginning of the first major assault'' on the nation's
drug problem, according to one of the legislation's principal
sponsors.
   ``We have to be more forceful,'' Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,
said at a news conference Wednesday with more than a dozen of the
bill's 35 House and Senate co-sponsors. ``We have mobilized a few
assets; we have a lot more to do.''
   The cost of the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 would be
offset by an estimated $3.2 billion in debt collection mandated by
the bill, DeConcini said in introducing the legislation.
   The bill would add staff to the Internal Revenue Service and the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to collect an additional
$1.25 billion in taxes owed the government, and direct other
federal agencies to collect $2 billion in non-tax debt owed to
Uncle Sam. The money would be placed in a new Anti-Drug Abuse
Treasury Fund to help pay for the bill, DeConcini said.
   The 199-page bill calls for resurrecting the state and local
narcotics control grant program by providing $1.5 billion over
three years, including $250 million next year.
   Additionally, the bill moves the Coast Guard from the Department
of Transportation to the Treasury Department to provide better
coordination with the U.S. Customs Service, and creates a
streamlined deportation process for aliens who have been convicted
of a drug-related or violent crime.

<HEAD>Group Says EPA Report Will Show Many Eastern Streams Too Acidic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A major environmental group says an unreleased
report of the Environmental Protection Agency shows that up to 14
percent of streams in sampled areas of eastern mountains are too
acidic.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council Wednesday accused the EPA
of ``sitting on'' the stream findings, and said it had been
rebuffed in requests for release of the final report made under the
Freedom of Information Act.
   Richard Ayres, a council staff lawyer who chairs the Clean Air
Coalition of environmental groups, said: ``We tried to give them a
break. We have had this document for over a year and have been
urging them to release the final report. They stiffed us at every
turn.''
   As part of its research on the effects of acid rain, the EPA
extensively sampled lakes and streams in 1985 and 1986. Lake
results have been reported extensively.
   But the EPA criticized the use of preliminary data by the group.
Spokesman Chris Rice said many tables would show ``significant
changes'' when the document is ready for release, probably in May.

   Israeli troops shot dead an
Arab today and wounded four others, including a 12-year-old, in
clashes across the occupied territories, hospital officials said.
   Overnight, troops swept through the occupied lands in a mass
arrest of Palestinians.
   Majid Mohammed Ahmed Sawalma, 21, died of two bullet wounds to
the chest and heart during a clash in the Balatta refugee camp near
Nablus, Al Ittihad Hospital officials said.
   Among the four Palestinians wounded in scattered clashes frm
Hebron to Nablus was a 12-year-old girl from the village of Tamoun,
10 miles west of Nablus, the officials said.
   Arab media reports said troops were using several West Bank
schools as detention centers.
   The army said it was checking the reports of casualties and
declined to comment on reports that schools were being used as
detention centers.
   In Lebanon, Israeli warplanes attacked Palestinian guerrilla
bases on the outskirts of Sidon for the second straight day. There
was no immediate word on casualties.
   It was the third Israeli strike against Palestinian bases in
Lebanon in a week and the fifth this year.
   Because of the ongoing violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Monsignor Michel Sabbah, Jerusalem's Roman Catholic patriarch,
decided to cancel the traditional Palm Sunday procession from the
Mount of Olives to Jerusalem's Old City.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, acting in his capacity as
interior minister, ordered the Haifa-based Al Ittihad, a communist
newspaper, closed until the end of the month on charges it was
inciting Arab unrest.
   An Israeli court ordered the army to return film confiscated
earlier this week from Time and Newsweek magazines and the Reuters
news agency but said Israeli authorities had the right to process
the film first. The film, taken Sunday, showed an Israeli soldier
moments after he was shot and killed in Bethlehem.
   The soldier was the first Israeli soldier to be killed since the
unrest in the occupied territories broke out Dec. 8. According to
U.N. figures, 107 Arabs have died in the unrest, most of them
killed by Israeli gunfire.
   ``We're not satisfied with the decision,'' said Robert Slater, a
Time correspondent and chairman of the Foreign Press Association.
``We had demanded the return of the film immediately without it
being processed.''
   Israeli officials rounded up at least 12 Palestinians in the
occupied Gaza Strip overnight, bringing to more than 107 the number
of Arabs arrested there in the past four days, the Gaza Lawyers'
Association said today.
   One attorney, Raji Sourani, said the lawyers' association counts
only those reported by family members and estimated the actual
number of arrests in the past four days in Gaza at about 350.
   An Islamic official in Hebron said Israeli soldiers had detained
more than 150 imams, or Moslem religious leaders, in nighttime
roundups this week. The official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said most of those detained were members of the
fundamentalist Islamic Jihad movement.
   The army has confirmed it is making arrests but has refused to
give details. Israeli officials have said the tactic has reduced
Arab violence.
   The patriarch decided to suspend this Sunday's procession
because of the possibility of violence along its narrow, winding
route through Arab east Jerusalem, said the Rev. Cladio Baratto,
director of the Christian Information Center in the Old City. The
procession commemorates Jesus' entry into Jerusalem before his
crucifixion.
   ``Prudence suggests this decision. It was a personal decision of
the Patriarch and no other forces influenced him,'' Baratto told
The Associated Press.
   Baratto denied reports that Sabbah, Jerusalem's first Arab
patriarch for Latin-rite Catholics, had been pressured by the
underground leadership of the Palestinian unrest to call off the
ceremony, which has been canceled only three times since 1932.
   Baratto told the Jerusalem Post there were fears that Christians
from the occupied territories would be prevented from attending due
to curfews.
   On Tuesday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin reportedly told a
parliamentary committee that Israel has jailed 3,000 Arabs since
anti-occupation violence began Dec. 8. An additional 1,000 Arabs
were arrested but set free, he said.
   Rabin on Wednesday told officers in the Gaza Strip that
large-scale rioting ``has been substantially reduced ... as a
result of the general activity of the army, the security forces,
the riot police.
   ``We feel a certain tiredness among the (Arab) population,'' he
said.
   Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said in Bethlehem on
Wednesday that Israel's policy was ``a prolonged combined action
accompanied with patience and built on three elements: the military
force, local punishments and economic pressure.''

<TEXT>
   Pro-government newspapers today
announced the 60-day cease-fire between the Sandinistas and Contra
rebels with banner headlines but said the accord was only a
beginning in efforts to end six years of war.
   The government and Contra rebels on Wednesday night agreed to
the cease-fire to negotiate an end to their war and signed a
nine-point accord that promises the rebels a role in Nicaragua's
political process.
   ``Cease-Fire! Peace Explodes?'' read the eight-column headline
in El Nuevo Diario. Barricada, the official paper of the leftist
Sandinistas, said: ``The First Step Toward Peace.''
   The agreement was the first concrete step toward ending the
conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people.
   State-run Radio Voice of Nicaragua in broadcasting the
cease-fire softened its tones and referred to the rebels as ``the
Contras,'' instead of ``the mercenaries.''
   El Nuevo Diario, in an editorial, offered a sombering note.
   ``Is the mercenary directorate really disposed to fulfill the
Sapoa agreements?'' the editorial said. ``And if they are, are they
capable of maintaing their positions while facing a negative
reaction from the president of the United States?''
   The cease-fire is to begin April 1, with negotiators meeting
again April 6 in Managua to work out a permanent truce. In the
interim, a truce that took effect Monday is to remain in force.
   President Daniel Ortega unexpectedly traveled to this small
village on the Costa Rican border for the signing, which followed
three days of talks.
   He called the plan ``a great challenge for all Nicaraguans'' and
called on the United States ``to support this effort and get ready
to normalize its relations with Nicaragua.''
   ``I think, I hope and I believe that we have made a start, a
firm start to end this war that is killing ... sons of the same
country, sons of the same mothers,'' said Contra leader Adolfo
Calero.
   Alfredo Cesar, another leader of the U.S.-supported rebels, said
the nine points in the agreement ``are not solely an opportunity to
achieve peace and agreement, but the only opportunity.''
   The agreement was made ``among Nicaraguans, full of good will
and confidence in the future,'' said Cesar, who was among Contra
and Sandinista leaders crowded on a makeshift dais.
   Neither the State Department nor the White House had any
immediate comment on the agreement, which calls for the estimated
10,000 rebels to move into specified zones in Nicaragua during the
first 15 days of April. Delegations from both sides will return to
Sapoa on Monday to determine the zones.
   The Contras also agreed to accept only humanitarian aid from a
neutral organization. This would rule out further military aid from
the United States, which President Reagan has tried in vain to
secure from Congress. U.S. aid ended Feb. 29 and a successful
Sandinista military offensive ensued.
   Under the agreement, the Sandinistas will on Sunday release 100
Contra prisoners and free half the remaining 1,400 such prisoners
when Contra fighters have moved into the designated zones. The
remaining 700 Contra prisoners will be freed when a permanent truce
is in place.
   The 1,800 former National Guardsmen in prison since the
Sandinistas overthrew the late President Anastasio Somoza in July
1979 will be released after a final truce is worked out. Under
Somoza, the army was called the National Guard.
   The agreement says the Sandinista government will guarantee
freedom of expression without restrictions, in accordance with a
regional peace plan signed last August by Ortega and the presidents
of four other Central American countries.
   Many press liberties were barred in Nicaragua for almost six
years under a state-of-emergency decree that has since been lifted.
   The agreement says the Sandinista government will grant gradual
amnesty and allow all political exiles to return to the country
without fear of persecution and be able to participate in the
political process.
   The government also agreed to discuss the issue of military
service in a national dialogue with the internal political
opposition. The Contras had sought a suspension of conscription.
   In Managua, opposition leaders hailed the agreement.
   Eric Ramirez, president of the Social Christian Party, said,
``It is a positive effort. Hopefully, it will contribute to ending
the war and to the rise of the democratization of Nicaragua.''
   Gustavo Tablada of the Socialist Party called the move ``a
historic step ... a serious and responsible compromise.''
   The agreement was signed by Gen. Humberto Ortega, the defense
minister and head of the Sandinista delegation, and Calero. Also
signing were Joao Baena Soares, secretary-general of the
Organization of American States, and Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Managua.
   The secretary-general and cardinal attended the talks as
witnesses.
   The meeting at Sapoa was the first time the Sandinistas and
Contras had met on Nicaraguan soil.

<HEAD>Attempt To Give Sight To Girl Born Without Visible Eyes Fails</HEAD>

   Optic surgeons built eye sockets and an eyelid
for a 7-year-old girl born with her eyes completely covered by
skin, but they say they have failed in a long-shot attempt to give
her sight.
   ``The surgery was unsuccessful,'' Dr. Allen Putterman, an
ophthalmologist who operated on Dilek Erdogan of Istanbul, Turkey,
said late Wednesday at the University of Illinois Hospital.
   Surgeons hoped to implant a cornea in the little girl's right
eye Wednesday, but after three incisions guided by an ultrasonic
scan they found no iris or pupil, Putterman said. The eye appeared
to be all sclera, or white. Dilek's left eye is so deformed it is
beyond sight, he said.
   Putterman said doctors might make one more attempt to find the
right part of the eye using magnetic resonance imaging but that it
is highly unlikely the girl will ever see even partially.
   ``We are a long, long way from the needed technology,'' said a
corneal transplant specialist, Dr. Joel Sugar. ``I don't think I'll
see it in my lifetime.''
   The man who brought Dilek to this country for surgery two years
ago, Chicago restaurateur Ismet Deletioglu, said he accepted
Putterman's verdict but couldn't stop hoping.
   ``The hope has to be there,'' Deletioglu said. ``It's part of
humanity, you know.''
   Dilek suffers from a rare condition callyed cryptophthalmos, or
hidden eye, in which the eyes are below the skin, Putterman said.
She has a nose and a mouth ``and that's it for her face,'' he said.
   Cryptopthalmos in both eyes is so rare that there are only three
or four accounts of it in medical literature, Putterman said.
   Removal of the skin that had covered the girl's eyes revealed
that the retina of her right eye could detect light, he said. But
even if Wednesday's implant had succeeded, he said, she would have
been able to make out only vague forms.
   Putterman had built sockets for both eyes and used tissue from
the girl's mouth to construct a right eyelid. He is repeating the
procedure for the left eye.
   Putterman said cosmetic surgery probably will continue to make
Dilek's face appear more normal and that an artificial eye will be
inserted in her right eye socket in the next three or four weeks.
He said he plans to remove the badly scarred left eye and replace
it with an artificial one in about five months.
   Dilek's mother, Guldane Erdogan, 44, was silent for a few
moments when she was told that her daughter probably would never
see.
   Then, through an interpreter, she thanked the doctors.
   ``I'm so thankful that these two gentlemen took the courage to
even try,'' she said.
   She also said she was glad that the cosmetic surgery would
eventually make her daughter's appearance normal.
   Deletioglu, 44, who is from Antioch, Turkey, read of the girl's
plight in a Turkish newspaper. He has housed Dilek and her mother
in his home for the past two years and has held fund-raising events
for the medical expenses.

   She's $90,000 short of her fund-raising
goal, but Mellissa L. Sanders was ready to descend from a record
516 days atop two telephone poles having gained a fiance and the
pride of her pole-sitting mom.
   ``I'm going to miss the birds on my balcony and the crazy
drivers going by down below,'' said Miss Sanders, who late this
afternoon planned to climb down from the 43-foot-high shack she
called home for more than 1{ years.
   Miss Sanders, interviewed today on ABC's ``Good Morning
America,'' joked that the first thing she wants to do when she
climbs down is ``kiss the ground, and never leave it again. No, I
don't really know.''
   On Feb. 25, the 19-year-old woman who had hoped to raise
$100,000 for cancer research broke the 488-day mark for
pole-sitting set by Mark Sutton of Victoria, British Columbia, and
listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
   During that time, in which she endured two winters and many
meals of pizza and submarine sandwiches, she raised $6,000.
   She said she stayed another month to raise more money, and
reported $4,000 more in donations.
   Even though Miss Sanders was far from the monetary goal, her
mother, Mauri Rose Sanders, said was still ``proud enough to
burst.''
   ``I feel like we both did it,'' said Mrs. Sanders, who broke a
smiliar pole-sitting record in 211 days in 1959.
   Her daughter's fiance, 25-year-old Keith Seal of Monterey,
Calif., was on hand Wednesday to help her prepare for her descent.
They met after Seal read an article about Miss Sanders and
telephoned her. They announced their engagement in August, before
meeting.
   ``We've been engaged and we haven't even gone on a date yet,''
Seal said.
   But Seal has been to the poletop abode.
   The first time, ``it was scary coming up here. I hate heights.
But once I was up here, everything turned out fine. She's turned
out better than I expected,'' Seal said today on ABC's ``Good
Morning America.''
   ``Everything happened right. Nothing was forced or pushed or
anything. It just fell into place.''
   He said a wedding date of Nov. 5, 1989 _ the anniversary of the
day they met _ had been discussed.
   ``He's great. He's been just great,'' said Miss Sanders, who
grew up in Tucson, Ariz.
   Her 6-by-7-by-9-foot shack was equipped with a plastic kiddie
pool, television and a telephone that prompted regular $300 phone
bills. For company she had her cat, Pole Cat.
   She even refused to come down last February, when 70 mph winds
buffeted her during a major snowstorm.
   ``I've had mirror after mirror up here, and every one has broken
almost immediately,'' she said. ``Maybe that's why I've had bad
luck'' in fund-raising.
   Another bit of bad luck, her mother says, was in dealing with
the man who initially sponsored the pole-sit, Dick Turner, as a way
to advertise his restaurant, the South Pole, and raise money for a
charitable cause.
   Miss Sanders said she moved from Arizona to do the stunt when
she heard from a relative that Turner was looking for a
pole-sitter. Miss Sanders' sister, Rebecca, had cancer, but her
disease has been in remission four years. However, Turner opted out
of the project less than six months after it was started,
contending the Sanderses expected too much financial support and
were claiming too large a percentage of the charitable proceeds.
   ``I'm glad she made it ... but she wanted to change the rules
once she got up in the house,'' said Turner, who plans to turn
$3,300 in donations over to Indiana University cancer research this
week.
   Mrs. Sanders replied angrily, saying, ``We've done nothing
wrong. It's just that he pulled out on Mellissa.''
   Miss Sanders said she plans to move back to Arizona in May and
attend a trade school.
   ``I'll miss being able to just do what I want and talk on the
phone all night. I'm going to get back to nine to five,'' she said.
   ``I'm looking forward to walking around and spending time with
family and friends and being able to drive my car.''
   The last thing she will miss is taking a bath atop in the
inflatable tub. ``I have water, but washing my hair was really
difficult,'' she said.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Tours Two Chicago Public Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett visited
two schools here but said he saw nothing to change his assessment
of Chicago's system as the nation's worst, based on student
achievement on standardized tests.
   ``Of course, there are successes here. Of course, there are
positive things going on that deserve recognition,'' he said
Wednesday. ``But things are going to have to improve. We're going
to need more than a few success stories.''
   Bennett visited an all-black elementary school in a crime-ridden
neighborhood and an integrated high school at the invitation of
Jacqueline Vaughn, president of the Chicago Teachers Union.
   Last fall, Bennett said Chicago's public schools were suffering
an ``educational meltdown,'' and Mrs. Vaughn hoped to change his
views with a look at what she called daily educational successes.
   Bennett's first stop was Mary Terrell Elementary School, where
all the students in the upper grades are reading below their grade
level, though scores have improved in the last year. The school
serves the Robert Taylor Homes, a decaying public-housing project.
   At William J. Bogan High School in a predominantly white
neighborhood, Bennett visited a computer lab and an advanced
algebra class where he saw a teacher he later described as
excellent.
   Bennett said he saw superb teachers at both schools and thought
both had good principals. ``But two schools do not a system make.
The facts remain the facts,'' he said.
   Earlier, he had cited problems with the nation's third-largest
school system that include a dropout rate approaching 50 percent
and low standardized test scores. Half of Chicago's high schools
ranked in the bottom 1 percent of U.S. schools for scores on the
American College Test.
   Mrs. Vaughn, sitting beside Bennett at a news conference after
the tour, said a recent survey showed Chicago students ranked 20th
out of 41 large urban school systems in scores on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test.
   She said a survey of 21 large urban school systems found that
Chicago ranked 16th for student performance on the ACT.

   Americans' personal incomes rose a healthy 0.9
percent in February, the best showing in four months, while
consumer spending climbed at the most rapid pace since December,
the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department also said consumer spending, powered by
a pickup in auto sales, advance 0.7 percent in February, a marked
improvement from the 0.1 percent January increase.
   The rise in personal incomes followed a modest 0.3 percent
January increase and was the best showing since a 1.9 percent
increase in October.
   With incomes rising faster than spending, Americans' savings
rate climbed as well, rising to 5.2 percent of after-tax income
last month, the highest level since October.
   The big gain in incomes reflected in part healthy increases in
employment which occurred during February. The unemployment rate
dropped to 5.7 percent last month, an 8{-year low.
   Analysts said the new figures showed that the collapse of stock
prices last October has had little impact on consumer spending
decisions and provided fresh evidence that the economy should
continue expanding this year with no threat of a recession.
   The 0.7 percent increase in personal consumption spending, the
biggest advance since a 0.8 percent rise in December, which
includes virtually everything except nterest payments on debt,
reflected a big increase of $7.4 billion in sales of durable goods,
a category which had declined $2.4 billion in January. The report
said this swing came from a rebound in auto sales.
   Purchases of non-durable goods, items not expected to last at
least three years, rose $2 billion in February after having fallen
$7.7 billion in January.
   Purchases of services, which include housing costs, increased
$12.4 billion following a $13.7 billion rise in January.
   Wages and salaries, the most important segment of the income
category, rose $15.4 billion in February after a $13.3 billion
January increase.
   Farm incomes increased $8.5 billion in February after a decline
of $8.2 billion in Janaury. The big February gain and the large
January decline were both attributed to swings in government
subsidy payments to farmers.
   Disposable income, the amount left over after taxes are paid,
climbed 1.1 percent in February, almost double the 0.6 percent
January increase. It was the best showing since a 2.1 percent rise
in October and was credited in part to individual tax cuts taking
effect as part of the landmark 1986 tax overhaul legislation.

   The golden arches spanned the
communist world for the first time as McDonald's opened a fast-food
restaurant today in the Yugoslavian capital.
   ``This is just like home,'' said Candace Hackett of Greeley,
Conn., an American living in Belgrade who was among the first
customers on opening day. ``I can't believe American hamburgers are
finally here.''
   Police were called in to keep order as hundreds of customers
waited in lines around the block at Slavija, one of Belgrade's main
downtown squares.
   ``Both the hamburger and the restaurant are fantastic, and I
think Yugoslavs will like them,'' said the 16-year-old Dragan
Petrovic after eating his first Big Mac. Five of his teen-age
friends nodded in agreement.
   There are nearly 10,000 McDonald's restaurants in the world, but
the Belgrade outlet is the first in a communist country. The
American corporation plans to open five more restaurants in
Yugoslavia in the next five years.
   The new restaurant features a plush interior which can seat 350
visitors and serve up to 2,500 meals an hour, operators said. It is
set in a neatly decorated, old building that has been extensively
renovated with an interior of amber-colored marble floors and
tables, soft illumination, pastel-colored upholstery, and modern
art paintings.
   A Big Mac meal, consisting of a hamburger, Coca Cola and french
fries, costs the equivalent of $2.57, competitive with similar
foods in the city's other restaurants.
   The Belgrade media has said the success of McDonald's in
Yugoslavia depends on its acceptance by people long accustomed to a
hamburger-like fast food dish called the Pljeskavica.
   The traditional dish is made with ground pork and onions instead
of the beef used in Big Macs and other American hamburgers. It is
also served in a bun and sold throughout the country in fast-food
outlets and other restaurants.
   ``In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac and
Pljeskavica,'' said Vesna Milosevic, an official of Genex, a
Yugoslav state-run enterprise that contracted the joint venture
agreement with McDonald's. They'll share profits equally, but the
restaurant will be managed and run entirely by 110 Yugoslavs.
   McDonald's will also bump heads with other Yugoslavian customs,
such as the time-honored Balkan tradition of lingering after meals.
In the first few months of its operation, specially-trained
personnel will issue warnings to loiterers, said Predrag Dostanic,
managing director of the facility.
   The next Eastern European McDonald's is scheduled to open in
Budapest, Hungary, next month, according to McDonald's officials.

<TEXT>
   An exiled Soviet artist who painted
a picture of Mickey Mouse partly as an expression of his love of
American life has incurred the wrath of the Walt Disney Co.
   Artist Mihail Chemiakin said he wrote to Disney chairman Michael
Eisner inviting him and other company officials to see the painting
``Sorokin Soup,'' then on display at the Bowles-Sorokko Gallery in
Beverly Hills. He even suggested Disney might want to buy it.
   Instead, he said Wednesday, he was answered with a March 11
legal response saying not only would Disney not accept his
invitation to look or buy, the company objected to the gallery
display and to any attempts to sell the painting because the face
of Mickey Mouse belongs to Disney alone.
   ``It is sad and ironic that an artist who was forced out of the
Soviet Union because of political censorship for his artwork would
come into the West ... and be hit by censorship here,'' gallery
co-owner Serge Sorokko said Wednesday.
   The painting since has been taken down, said Sorokko, who called
from San Francisco, where he co-owns another gallery.
   Sorokko said the New York-based artist chose the image of Mickey
Mouse more as a tribute to the late artist Andy Warhol, who reveled
in pop icons, and certainly not to rip off the good Disney name.
   ``Mickey Mouse is a symbol of America. ... Their approach is
just totally ludicrous,'' he said.
   Chemiakin, who came to the United States in 1978, is known for
creating a painting style called ``metaphysical synthesis,'' which
combines images from various cultures and times, Sorokko said.
   He was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1971, according to
information released by his publicist here. He had been accepted at
the Soviet's Repin Academy of Art at age 14, but was thrown out two
years later for failing to conform to the traditional ``Socialist
Realism'' style of painting.
   Recently though, Chemiakin has been invited back to the Soviet
Union to display his work, Sorokko said.

   About 400 people decrying what they called a
lack of government concern about AIDS demonstrated today in the
city's financial district, and 105 protesters were arrested when
they blocked the streets.
   ``We're protesting the same thing we've been protesting for the
past year, lack of government oversight of the whole AIDS
predicament, the whole AIDS crisis,'' said David Erwin, a founder
of ACT UP _ the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power.
   Most of the demonstrators circled inside police barriers on the
sidewalk at Broadway and Wall Street as Wall Street workers headed
to their offices. Then, 19 protesters, one in a wheelchair, formed
a line across Broadway. They were arrested and placed on a police
bus, but 19 more people sat down in the street to block the bus.
They too were arrested, as was a third group of 11 who also tried
to stop the bus.
   Others were arrested after they tried to block nearby
intersections.
   Inspector Robert Baumert said the protesters would be charged
with disorderly conduct, blocking vehicular traffic and resisting
arrest.

   Northwest Airlines' bold step in banning smoking
on most of its flights is not expected to be followed soon by other
major U.S. airlines, industry analysts say.
   Northwest, the nation's fifth-largest airline, announced
Wednesday it will prohibit smoking on all its domestic flights
except those to and from Hawaii and on some foreign routes.
   The ban makes Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest the first major U.S.
airline to mandate a smoke-free environment, surpassing federal
regulations that on April 23 outlaw smoking on all domestic flights
less than two hours.
   ``It does run the risk of some loss of business,'' said James V.
Cammisa, publisher of Travel Industry Indicators, a New York-based
newsletter. ``I guess they (Northwest officials) really stuck their
neck out.''
   Wall Street seemed unimpressed by Northwest's move. The
airline's stock closed on Wall Street at $45.75 a share, down 12{
cents from Tuesday.
   Several smokers waiting to depart on Northwest flights Wednesday
from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport said they don't
object to the smoking ban.
   ``It's probably a good idea,'' said Janice Davis, a Boston real
estate broker. ``I can get by without smoking.''
   Some Northwest flight attendants who are smokers said the new
policy might help them quit smoking, the St. Paul Pioneer
Press-Dispatch reported today.
   The new policy, ``Northwest Clears the Air,'' takes effect April
23 with the new federal regulations. It applies to flights within
the contiguous 48 states and to and from Alaska, Mexico, Canada,
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.
   The longest flights covered by the smoking ban are four or five
hours, the airline said. About 30 percent of Northwest's domestic
flights and about 20 percent of all domestic flights last more than
the two-hour federal duration. Northwest flights to and from Hawaii
and overseas will offer smoking sections because those flights
``carry a greater proportion of foreign passengers who feel
differently about the issue,'' the airline said.
   A.B. Magary, Northwest's marketing chief, said the ban accedes
to passenger and employee requests. The policy is not risk-free, he
said, but ``we believe more nonsmokers will switch to Northwest
than smokers will leave.''
   That wasn't the case for Muse Air Corp. of Dallas, a regional
carrier that failed to establish itself as the only non-smoking
airline in 1985. Its research showed the policy diverted as many as
35 percent of potential fliers.
   Surveys showed customers find ``price, convenience and service
more important than non-smoking'' in an airline, Muse spokeswoman
Shari Cohen said at the time. The policy ended when Muse was sold
to Southwest Airlines Co.
   No. 2 American Airlines is watching Northwest's lead but, ``We
have no plans to follow that move,'' said American spokeswoman Mary
O'Neill. Its surveys indicate a significant number of people want
to smoke on planes.
   American and other big airlines contacted Wednesday said their
no-smoking policies would meet the new federal law, which mandates
civil fines of as much as $1,000 for smoking, $2,000 for tampering
with lavatory smoke alarms.
   ``We are ready to implement our no-smoking policy ... in line
with the federal law,'' said Dan Sheehy spokesman for United
Airline, the nation's largest airline.
   Airline analyst Anthony Hatch of Argus Research Corp., said he
did not expect other carriers to match Northwest's policy. ``It's a
gutsy move and most airlines don't make gutsy moves,'' he said.
``It could alienate some people.''
   The alienated include The Great American Smoker's Club of
Dallas, which on April 22 offers smoking flights and the same fares
as Southwest Airlines from Dallas to such cities as Austin,
Houston, New Orleans and Oklahoma City.
   Using leased planes from Las Vegas-based Royal West Airlines,
the club hopes to serve 63 cities from five hubs with 60 planes in
two years, said club president Glenn Herndon.
   ``When the smoking ban begins, we want to offer smokers an
alternative _ and, hopefully, make some money,'' he said.
Non-smokers will be allowed on board, but they will have to be
``tolerant,'' the club says.

   The new president of the Southern Baptist
Alliance says he intends to continue working within the Southern
Baptist Convention, though he says his group is taking on the
appearance of a separate denomination.
   The alliance represents a moderate group within the 14.7
million-member convention, which is dominated by fundamentalists.
   ``We are not a fringe group, we are not an avant garde faction
of the Southern Baptist Convention,'' the Rev. John Thomason said
Wednesday. ``The great majority of SBA members are denominational
loyalists.''
   Thomason said, however, that the alliance may appear to be
headed toward denominational status because of its publishing
activities and its discussions concerning the possible need for a
new seminary or divinity school.
   ``Whenever we take specific steps like that, we are acting
independently of the institutions of the Southern Baptist
Convention and that gives the appearance of independence, but it is
not our desire to forge a permanent split with the SBC,'' Thomason
said.
   Nevertheless, he said, the alliance has to be an ``advocate for
groups and causes we feel are disenfranchised. ... If this means
acting independently of the existing agencies and channels of SBC
life, then for the time being, we are willing to do that.''
   Thomason is pastor of the 561-member Northminster Baptist Church
in Jackson, Miss., the third church to join the alliance after its
formation in February 1987. The alliance has grown from 22 founders
to more than 25,000 members, including 40 churches in 11 states and
more than 2,000 individual members.
   The fundamentalists have gained control of the Southern Baptist
Convention hierarchy by electing their presidential candidates for
the past nine years. The president has broad appointive powers,
naming hundreds of people annually to various Baptist institutions,
including the boards of the six seminaries and the five major
operating agencies of the denomination.
   While both groups generally are conservative, they disagree on
key issues, including biblical inerrancy and ordination of women.
Fundamentalists, who oppose ordination of women, say the Bible is
without factual error, not only in matters of faith but also in
science and history. Moderates maintain there is room for
interpretation, especially in non-religious areas.

<HEAD>FEC Decides to Grant Matching Funds to LaRouche</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with decision in top 4 grafs, picking up in 2nd graf
pvs, A survey</NOTE>

   The Federal Election Commission today agreed
to grant federal matching funds to the presidential campaign of
political extremist Lyndon LaRouche, who is standing trial on a
charge relating to alleged irregularity in his 1984 campaign.
   The commission on a 5-1 vote said that LaRouche has fulfilled
the requirements for eligibility to receive matching funds.
   Commissioner Joan Aikens, voting against the majority, said that
an FEC survey of LaRouche contributors raised ``a question of
patent irregularity'' in fund raising.
   But Commissioner Scott Thomas said there was not enough evidence
to deny certification, and he added, ``Presidential candidates and
campaigns can come in many different shapes and colors.''
   A survey by the FEC's audit staff found that several people
whose checks ended up in LaRouche's 1988 presidential coffers did
not intend to contribute to his campaign.
   That was the response of 6 percent of the 713 LaRouche
contributors who answered the FEC's survey.
   In describing the responses, the FEC audit staff wrote in a
report:
   ``Many of the responses included unsolicited written comments
wherein the individuals described instances where he@she 1. felt
pressured into making a contribution, 2. made contributions
believing that the contribution was for a specific purpose other
than furthering Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.'s presidential nomination
campaign, 3. made loans to the campaign, and 4. had contributed to
a number of LaRouche's interests, while making all checks payable
to LDC.''
   The audit staff recommended the commission find that LaRouche is
not eligible for matching funds.
   But the FEC's legal staff came up with the opposite
recommendation, stating that the ``patent irregularities indicated
by the survey results do not justify an unfavorable eligibility
report.''
   The commission was expected to make its decision at a meeting
early today.
   FEC legal counsel Lawrence Noble's written opinion said some of
the responding contributors seemed confused, or contributed to
LaRouche thinking he was a Republican or independent candidate
instead of a Democrat, which he is. Those responses should not have
been considered negative, Noble said, because the donors did
apparently intend to give money to a presidential campaign.
   The auditors contacted 1,062 of those contributors, after
finding that some of the checks he submitted with his application
for federal matching funds were made out simply to the initials
``L.D.C.''
   In some cases, those initials were written over the initials
``SDI.'' And some checks contained memo notations regarding AIDS or
SDI _ which generally refers to President Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative _ indicating the donors may not have intended to
give money to a presidential campaign, but to one of those causes.
   Some contributors contacted by The Associated Press said they
were under the impression they were contributing to an anti-AIDS
campaign when they gave checks to LaRouche solicitors.
   ``While the survey results raise serious questions regarding
whether contributions submitted by the LaRouche campaign were made
with the requisite donative intent, they do not show a clear
pattern of fraud or patent irregularities,'' Noble wrote. He also
said the percent of negative responses _ 39 out of 713 _ was
``arguably small.''
   Nonetheless, the counsel recommended that the commission take
special precautions in approving LaRouche's submissions for
matching funds. Instead of the usual five-day approval period, a
review period of 25 days should be allowed for the LaRouche
submissions to give the FEC staff time to check for irregularities
in the checks before giving him any money, the counsel recommended.
   The recommendation also suggests that any checks written out
simply to LDC, or those with memo notations ``indicating lack of
donative intent'' should be automatically declared unmatchable.
   To be certified for matching funds, a candidate must raise
$100,000 across 20 states in individual contributions of $250 or
less. After becoming eligible, the candidates can receive matching
funds for each contribution of $250 or less that they raise
privately.
   LaRouche is on trial in Boston, charged with conspiracy to
obstruct a grand jury investigation into alleged credit card fraud
and other irregularities in his 1984 campaign.

<HEAD>Calls For End To State Interference In Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's ruling body today
called for the first time for a ``radical'' reduction of state
interference in the economy as a way to solve the nation's worst
economic and political crisis in history.
   The lengthy statement from the Presidency also urged new
regulations on joint ventures with foreign partners, more private
business in the nation's economy and changes in the tax policy
which would stimulate economic growth.
   The unusual statement, carried by the official Tanjug news
agency, marked the first time Yugoslavia's ruling body had called
for changes in the running of the economy of this nonaligned
communist nation.
   The statement appeared designed to give guidance to the
government for tackling the economic and political problems
expected to arise when a wage and price freeze imposed last
November expires in May.
   There have been increasing calls for the state and the Communist
Party to relinquish control of the economy.
   With the current annual inflation rate of around 170 percent and
a foreign debt exceeding $20 billion, Yugoslavia is faced with its
worst economic and political crisis in history.
   The Presidency demanded that ``a program of measures and
activities'' be made by the federal government to strengthen market
forces and called for ``radical reduction of state regulations ...
in order to overcome the dominating role of the politics over the
economy.''
   The statement said the implementation of this program is of
``prime interest'' and should be monitored by the presidencies of
Yugoslavia's six constituent republics and two autonomous provinces.
   Critics of Yugoslavia's unique system of self-management,
whereby factories, farms and offices are nominally run by the
workers, say the system is hampered by interference from the state
and the Communist Party.
   The government last year imposed a series of price and wage
freezes in an attempt to control inflation and stabilize sinking
living standards. However, 1987 saw a record 1,500 strikes as
workers protested low wages.
   The government of Yugoslav premier Branko Mikulic has recently
faced sharp criticism even in the state-run press for its economic
policies. There have been repeated calls for the premier and his
cabinet to step down _ something that has never happened in
communist Yugoslavia.
   The statement by the Presidency said such calls ``represent an
unacceptable political campaign'' that hurts the government's
domestic and foreign activities.
   The Presidency demanded, without specifying, an ``urgent''
passing of new joint venture laws.
   According to current law provisions, foreign companies can own
no more than 51 percent shares in their joint ventures with
Yugoslav enterprises and have no right to manage the companies.
   The current law attracted little investment by foreign partners
since the unstable economic situation in this Balkan country
frightens off possible investors.
   According to a draft of a new joint venture law, which has been
waiting for a long time to be passed by the parliament, foreign
partners may be allowed to hold up to 99.9 percent of shares in
joint ventures and the right to manage such companies.
   The ruling body also called for ``substantial'' reduction of
administrative curbs on private business and changes in the income
tax policy.

   A blaze erupted today in the engine
room of a British ferry shortly after it left the Belgian port of
Zeebrugge with 348 people aboard, but tugs towed the ship to port
and no one was injured.
   P and O, owners of the 18,000-ton Nordic, said the two-hour fire
wrecked the ferry's power system.
   Coast guards called a major alert after the Nordic, on a
six-hour English Channel crossing from Zeebrugge to the English
port of Felixstowe, reported fire aboard 30 minutes before it had
been due to dock.
   The Nordic, surrounded by a flotilla of tugs and life boats, was
stranded for several hours five miles off the coast before tugs got
the vessel under tow and brought it to Felixstowe, in southeast
England.
   ``Three life boats were dispatched and a helicopter was put on
standby,'' said John Davies, coast guard spokesman at the nearby
port of Harwich.
   A P and O spokesman said the fire was put out by automatic
firefighting equipment and the crew. The fire was confined to the
engine room.
   ``Everyone on board was very calm and there was no danger to
anyone,'' said P and O spokesman Chris Lamming.
   Last March, another P and O ferry, the Herald of Free
Enterprise, capsized after leaving Zeebrugge, killing 193 people.

   A man being sought today for questioning in his
5-year-old daughter's death was previously accused of abusing the
girl but the charge was dropped for lack of evidence, court records
show.
   Police want to question Ibrahim Thiab Mubarak, 38, a substitute
teacher, about the death of Julianna Cathleen Olson, whose
decomposed body was found in his deserted apartment.
   An autopsy conducted Wednesday showed evidence of trauma but a
ruling on the cause of death was awaiting further tests, said
Deputy Coroner Chuck Bolton.
   Based on preliminary findings, however, ``this case is being
handled as a homicide,'' Bolton said.
   In January 1986, Mubarak had been charged with one count of
felony child abuse and one count of assault after the child was
hospitalized. The charge was dismissed later in the year.
   Mubarak obtained cstody of the girl after his ex-wife, Cathleen
Olson, died in 1983. The couple had been married briefly in 1981,
separating after three weeks.
   Last fall, Mubarak won a custody dispute involving the child's
grandmother, Betty Olson of San Diego.
   In awarding custody, Superior Court Judge Napoleon Jones
expressed concern about reports in court files and ordered that no
corporal punishment was to be used on the child.
   Betty Olson continued to seek custody of the child, said her
attorney, Kathryn Ashworth
   ``She's absolutely devastated,'' Ashworth said. ``I'm pretty
devastated too. She was a lovely, charming little 5-year-old girl.''
   Julianna's body was found Tuesday in the two-bedroom apartment
by Nita Morin, who manages the seven-unit building. Deputy Coroner
Penne Hammerstead said that the girl had been dead for more than a
week.

   Iran and Iraq fired eight missiles into
each others' capitals today, and Tehran claimed new victories in
heavy fighting in northeastern Iraq.
   Iraq said it fired six long-range missiles into Tehran at a rate
of one a minute in retaliation for Iranian artillery bombardment of
Iraqi cities. Iraq said it was destroying Tehran ``piece by piece.''
   Iran reported at least 10 civilians dead and 100 wounded after
the missiles hit two schools, two mosques and two hospitals as well
as shops and houses.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, Cyprus, said Iranian Revolutionary Guards fired two
missiles into Baghdad in reprisal.
   There was no immediate confirmation of those missile strikes
from the Iraqi capital.
   In the Persian Gulf today, a ship put out a distress signal and
appeared to be the victim of an Iranian attack, maritime salvage
executives said.
   The executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Friendship reported its engine room was on fire. If it was the
victim of Iranian attack, it would be Iran's 10th attack on neutral
shipping in the gulf since last Friday.
   Iran also claimed its troops routed two Iraqi commando brigades
and four armored battalions early today and advanced to within five
miles of the mountain town of Sayyid Sadiq. The reports came in the
latest phase of Iran's 9-day-old offensive into northeastern Iraq.
   Iran said today's ground assault retaliated for Iraqi chemical
bomb attacks last week that killed 5,000 Iraqi Kurds whose
hometowns were overrun by Iranian troops fighting with the
autonomy-seeking Kurds.
   Tehran's news agency said the Iranians repulsed a counterattack
by Iraq's 5th Army Corps, killing or wounding 1,000 Iraqis,
capturing 400 and knocking out 30 tanks and armored vehicles.
   But the official Iraqi news agency, also monitored in Cyprus,
said ``thousands of Iranians were killed'' in artillery barrages
and air strikes.
   ``The charlatan regime in Tehran is reaping today the harvest of
its crimes,'' said an Iraqi military communique broadcast by the
agency.
   Iranian jets flew 14 ground attack missions against Iraqi forces
in the battle zone and shot down an Iraqi warplane, Tehran's news
agency said. It said ground fire downed an Iraqi helicopter
gunship, but Baghdad denied losing any aircraft.
   Iraq has said it has fired 42 Al Hussein missiles into Tehran
since March 15 in what is known as the ``war of the cities.'' Iran
has retaliated by lobbing 14 missiles into the Iraqi capital, which
has a population of 5 million.
   Scores of other cities on both sides have been hit with
missiles, air raids and shellfire, with hundreds of civilians
killed or wounded on both sides.
   The Iranian news agency said the latest phase of the offensive,
the heaviest fighting in the northern part of the 730-mile front,
was launched in retaliatiation for Iraqi chemical bomb attacks on
Halabja, Khormal and Dojaila, three of the Kurdish towns captured
last week.
   The Iranians claimed the poison gas attacks killed 5,000 Kurdish
civilians and injured 5,000. Western reporters flown to Halabja by
the Iranians this week reported seeing hundreds of dead civilians
there with no obvious wounds.
   The correspondents reported that many people had died of
asphyxiation in their homes. Survivors were seen suffering from
burns consistent with poison gas.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Charled Redman charged in
Washington Wednesday that Iraq had used chemical weapons, banned
under a 1925 Geneva agreement, and urged the United Nations
Security Council to mount an international protest.
   Declaring the Iraqi action ``a particularly grave violation'' of
the Geneva protocol, Redman said there was evidence the Iraqis had
also fired chemical shells into Iran.
   The Iranian news agency said earlier this week that Iraqi
warplanes had dropped chemical bombs, believed to contain mustard
or phosgene gas, on eight towns in northwest Iran, causing scores
of civilian casualties.

   An Israeli court today convicted former nuclear
technician Mordechai Vanunu of treason and espionage for telling a
British newspaper his country possessed nuclear weapons. He could
receive a life prison term.
   The verdict, read behind closed doors in a courtroom with
boarded-up windows, climaxed the saga of the 34-year-old Israeli
who said he revealed his country's nuclear secrets for the good of
mankind.
   ``Mordechai is not desperate. He still wants to fight,'' said
defense attorney Avigdor Feldman as he emerged from the five-minute
session. He said Vanunu sat silently as the verdict was announced,
showing little emotion.
   ``I guess it was kind of inevitable,'' said Vanunu's younger
brother, Asher, who was not permitted into the secret proceedings.
``But I'm surprised they convicted him for treason.''
   Vanunu was hustled into the courtroom more than an hour before
the session, amid the same tight security that accompanied the
trial since it began in September. The three-judge panel had
refused an open trial, saying it would harm state security.
   Prosecutor Uzi Chasson said he would ask the court for a life
term, which in Israel is limited to 20 years. Sentencing is
scheduled Sunday.
   Feldman said he would appeal the verdict to Israel's High Court
of Justice.
   Vanunu, a former technician at Israel's nuclear facility in
Dimona and a Jewish-born convert to Christianity, was charged with
treason and espionage for describing Israel's nuclear capacity in
an interview with The Sunday Times of London. Based on Vanunu's
information, the newspaper concluded Israel had stockpiled the
world's sixth largest nuclear arsenal.
   Israel has never responded directly to allegations of its
nuclear capacity, saying only it would not be the first country to
introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East.
   Vanunu has insisted he made his revelations to alert the Middle
East and the world to the dangers of nuclear weapons. The state
argued he intended to harm Israel's security.
   Feldman said earlier he thought Vanunu had been given a fair
hearing, but complained about ``an atmosphere of guilt, with all
the attention and the crazy precautions taken around him.''
   Each day of the trial, Vanunu was taken to the Jerusalem
district courthouse from his jail in central Israel in a white van
with painted-over windows.
   His head was often covered with a motorcycle helmet to prevent
contact with waiting reporters, and police cars blared sirens as he
was hustled indoors.
   In prison, Vanunu has been held in near isolation, permitted to
see only his attorney and relatives. At one point, he went on a
hunger strike to demand the right to see his American girlfriend,
Judy Zimet.
   Vanunu's mysterious saga began in 1985 when he was fired from
the Dimona nuclear center in southern Israel, where he worked for
nine years. He went to Australia, where he became acquainted with a
priest and converted to Christianity.
   Vanunu later traveled to London, but disappeared in October
1986, just days before The Sunday Times published his revelations.
Israeli officials acknowledged several weeks later he was in
custody in Israel.
   Details of Vanunu's dramatic journey back to Israel were
revealed by his brother, Meir, who said Vanunu was lured from
London to Rome by an American woman named Cindy, who promised him
sex. In Rome, he was abducted by Israeli agents and spirited home,
Meir said.
   At a pre-trial court appearance, Vanunu managed to flash
reporters a message scribbled on his hand which told of the alleged
abduction. The incident led to increased security precautions.
   During the trial, Feldman presented witnesses who said Vanunu
had not harmed state security because the information he revealed
was already available in the academic world.
   Other defense witnesses testified Vanunu's revelations actually
bolstered Israel's security because they created the impression
among the country's Arab enemies that Israel was a nuclear power,
providing a deterrent effect.
   Feldman argued alternatively that if Israel had nuclear weapons,
it was acting outside international supervision, a position that
was morally and legally unsound.
   In a surprise move, he also subpoenaed Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres and senior legislator Abba Eban in an effort to show Israel's
leaders kept the decision to build nuclear weapons from the
parliament and the people, thereby violating Israeli law.

<TEXT>
   Authorities will ask Gov. Bob Martinez to
appoint a special prosecutor to handle the case of an assistant
state attorney who police say tried to bully an officer into
letting her go.
   Chief Assistant State Atorney Mack Futch also said he is
suspending Jan Bamping until State Attorney Frank Schaub returns
next week from vacation and reviews his decision.
   Police say Ms. Bamping, 32, and a passenger, Assistant State
Attorney Jerry Blevins, 27, threatened an officer in an attempt to
avoid getting into trouble, the Bradenton Herald reported Wednesday.
   Their car had been pulled over by Bradenton Beach Patrolman Ron
Robertson early Sunday after a 1{-mile chase at speeds of up to 90
mph, police reports said.
   Robertson said he believed Ms. Bamping had been drinking, but
didn't order her from the car for a sobriety test because she was
naked from the waist down.
   When he asked Ms. Bamping why she was partially nude, Robertson
said, she became upset and answered that it's ``not against the law
to drive nude.''
   Robertson charged Ms. Bamping with fleeing to elude an officer
and improper passing.
   ``She threatened (his job) right away,'' said Acting Police
Chief Bill Tillner. ``In my opinion, (Blevins) did try to influence
the officer with his position.''
   ``She said because she was with the State Attorney's Office, she
should not be treated like this,'' Robertson said. ``I told her she
had no right to endanger other people because of her job.''
   Ms. Bamping demanded his name and identification number and said
``she would see me in court,'' he said.
   Robertson's back-up officer, Patrolman John Cosby, confirmed
Robertson's account, Tillner said.
   No charges were brought against Blevins.
   Ms. Bamping's telephone number is not published, and she could
not be located for comment. The Herald also said it had been unable
to reach her.
   But Blevins told the Herald: ``I don't think we did anything
improper as far as using this office.''
   Ms. Bamping's case was scheduled for May 11 in traffic court.

   The lawyer for a man charged with sexually
assaulting his daughter says the allegations are more of the same
from the man's ex-wife, who last year went to jail rather than let
him visit their children.
   Mark Russell Murabito, 33, of Derry pleaded innocent Wednesday
in Rockingham County Superior Court to the charge of felonious
sexual assault. Bail was set at $5,000 personal recognizance on the
condition that Murabito have no contact with the daughter, now 5,
or her 3{-year-old brother.
   Murabito since March 1987 has had unsupervised visits with the
children, after a judge found no evidence to back Jesse Murabito's
claims that Murabito sexually abused their daughter.
   A grand jury last week indicted Murabito based on events since
the judge's decision, County Attorney Carleton Eldredge said.
   After Wednesday's arraignment, Raymond Kellett, Murabito's
lawyer, said the charge ``is simply an extension of the divorce
proceedings ... the same type of thing that the court has already
ruled on in hearings last year.''
   ``I am fairly convinced by the evidence, or I wouldn't have gone
to the grand jury, that these children are being sexually abused,''
Eldredge said, adding that he has an ``obligation, in my job and my
conscience, to alleviate that situation.''
   Eldredge blamed the media for ruining any chance he would have
had to negotiate an out-of-court agreement with Murabito that would
result in ``long-term meaningful protection of the children without
public fanfare or trial.''
   In March 1987, Superior Court Judge Douglas Gray ruled after a
seven-day civil hearing that Mrs. Murabito and the experts she
marshaled had not proved Murabito sexually abused the girl.
   In a 19-page divorce decree, Gray admonished both parents to
stop ``tearing (the children) to pieces'' and gave Murabito
unsupervised visits, alternating weekends and holidays, as well as
two weeks each summer.
   Gray did not return a telephone call seeking comment on
Wednesday.
   A month before the divorce hearing, Gray had jailed Mrs.
Murabito for a week _ and gave Murabito temporary custody _ when
she refused to obey a court order to let her husband see the
children during supervised visits. Gray released her after she
agreed.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., left the
hospital today, smiling, joking and saying he feels better than he
looks.
   ``I've decided to re-enter the race for president,'' he joked.
The senator dropped out of the Democratic race last fall.
   Biden had been in Walter Reed Army Hospital for 11 days so
surgeons could implant a small umbrella-like filter in a vein to
prevent blood clots from reaching his lungs.
   A clot formed in the wake of surgery Biden had on Feb. 12 to
correct the ballooning of an artery that supplied blood to his
brain.
   He was to have a second operation for a similar but smaller
aneurysm on the other side of his head but instead returned to
Walter Reed on March 13 and doctors discovered a blood clot in his
lung.
   The clot itself was absorbed into the body without any damage, a
hospital spokesman said, but to prevent any further problems a team
of doctors last Friday inserted a tiny filter in a major vein. The
small device was implanted in the vena cava, an area just below the
breast bone.
   Biden said doctors will allow him to work two to four hours a
day at home in Delaware and that he should walk as exercise.
   He said that for the first time in years his waist size is 34.

   A judge has blocked the Ku Klux Klan from
holding a rally in a predominantly black neighborhood, citing
zoning laws that prohibit public gatherings without special
permission.
   ``We consider (the Klan) similar to clubs and other
organizations such as churches or synagogues'' which cannot hold
public gatherings in residential areas without special permits,
said Superior Court Judge William Fleming.
   Fleming on Wednesday enjoined the Klan from holding a rally and
cross-burning Friday in the yard of Robert Long, grand dragon of
the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
   The judge ruled that the gathering was public because Klan
members had distributed flyers inviting the public.
   The group could ask for a special exemption from the zoning
board, but Long said the rally will be moved instead.
   The Richmond County Commission and Sheriff Charles Webster had
gone to court to oppose the rally.
   Last April, county investigators interrupted a cross-burning in
Long's yard and filed charges of terroristic threats and acts
against 13 people, including Long. That case is pending.

   Twenty-eight current and former health
inspectors were named in complaints today accusing them of
extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars from restaurants to
ignore sanitary code violations, authorities say.
   The charges in the federal complaint involve at least one-third
of the city Health Department's inspection force of 70 and 300
restaurants in all five boroughs, U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney
of Brooklyn said in a news release.
   The arrests this morning culminated a three-year undercover
investigation by the FBI, the city Department of Investigation and
the U.S. attorney's office. This week agents confronted a number of
suspects to get them to wear microphones to gather evidence against
the leaders of the bribery ring.
   A report today in the New York Daily News said the operation was
code-named alternatively ``Operation Kitchen'' and ``Operation
Fork-It-Over.''
   The restaurants paid the bribes to avoid citations for
violations either real or invented, authorities said. The names of
the restaurants were not made public, but they ranged from fast
food restaurants to famous eateries, they said.
   The investigation also found that on-site inspectors split their
take with supervisors, who allegedly would punish inspectors who
were reluctant to share the extortion money with them, authorities
said.
   In one incident, inspectors demanded $1,400 from a restaurant
owner so his restaurant would not be closed for serious health
violations, according to the news release. In another, inspectors
charged a restaurant $1,200 to allow it to reopen despite serious
violations.
   Payoffs reached hundreds of thousands of dollars altogether. The
News said the restaurant owners are considered extortion victims
and are not being charged.
   Inspectors and supervisors are paid $25,000 to $30,000 annually
by the city. More than 15,000 food establishments are inspected
each year for compliance with health and cleanliness standards.

<HEAD>Four Cultural Revolution Military Leaders Out of Prison</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four military leaders imprisoned for an alleged
coup attempt against Mao Tse-tung in 1971 have been released, a
government spokesman said today.
   All four were top assistants to Defense Minister Lin Piao during
the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution that began in 1966, and all
were convicted of aiding him in an aborted attempt to murder Mao
and seize power.
   The releases leave only the ``Gang of Four'' still in prison
from among the 10 fallen Cultural Revolution power brokers
convicted in 1981 after a lengthy show trial.
   Lin was Mao's designated successor, a key creator of the Mao
cult and author of the ``Little Red Book'' of quotations from Mao.
He allegedly died in a plane crash in Mongolia while fleeing arrest.
   Zeng Tao, a spokesman for the National People's Congress,
China's legislature, disclosed the releases at a news conference.
   He said former air force commander Wu Faxian, former navy
political commissar Li Zuopeng and former army Gen. Jiang Tengjiao
were released on bail for medical treatment, but he did not say
when or disclose the nature of their illnesses.
   Qiu Huizuo, former director of the military's General Logistics
Department, completed his 16-year term in September and was
released, Zeng said.
   He did not explain why as recently as January, the Ministry of
Public Security insisted that all four former military leaders
remained in prison. Wu's and Li's terms end this year, while
Jiang's ends in 1989.
   Zeng said two of the Gang of Four members _ Mao's widow Jiang
Qing and former Vice Premier Zhang Chunqiao _ were being treated in
prison for unspecified ``geriatric diseases.'' Jiang Qing is 74 and
Zhang is 70.
   The Gang of Four, which also included former Politburo members
Wang Hongwen and Yao Wenyuan, was accused of ordering illegal
arrests during the decade-long Cultural Revolution and trying to
seize total power after Mao's death in 1976.
   Their arrest shortly after Mao died marked the end of the
Cultural Revolution, an era of bloody persecutions of intellectuals
and anyone suspected of lacking revolutionary fervor.

<HEAD>Washington Health Officials Start To Implement New AIDS
Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID AMMONS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Landmark AIDS legislation described by
sponsors as a model for America has gone into effect in Washington,
aimed at protecting the disease's victims and stopping its spread.
   The measure, funded by an appropriation of more than $5 million,
will tackle the killer disease through education, testing,
counseling, civil rights protection, and prosecution of people who
intentionally spread acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Gov. Booth Gardner signed the bill Wednesday and it took effect
immediately.
   ``We must recognize that AIDS is only beginning to take its toll
on human life and in costs to our society. By acting now,
especially with a strong public education program, we hope to save
many of our citizens' lives,'' the governor said.
   Key provisions of the measure are:
   _A 10-year prison sentence for intentionally spreading the AIDS
virus.
   _Mandatory AIDS education in grades 5 through 12 and
availability in colleges and trade schools. Mandatory AIDS training
for all public school personnel, emergency services crews and
health professionals.
   _Mandatory testing and counseling for all convicted of sex
crimes, prostitution or intravenous drug use. Violent prison
inmates would be tested at the request of the prison and approval
of the local health officer.
   _A procedure is created for confronting, examining, detaining
and confining infected individuals who refuse to modify their
behavior so they don't pose a threat to others. Due process
protections are provided.
   _Regional service networks will be set up in the six most
populous counties by Oct. 1.
   _Those who carry the AIDS virus, or who are perceived to have
it, will be protected from discrimination.
   Jule Sugarman, head of the Department of Social and Health
Services, said he already had followed the bill's directive and
created a new Office on AIDS. He said he began to confer with
county health officials on setting up regional AIDS service centers
across Washington.
   Those centers will do the mandatory and voluntary AIDS testing,
counseling, public education, and outreach to ``street kids'' and
other target populations. They also will plan and coordinate
services to AIDS patients, develop volunteer networks and notify
partners of infected people.
   ``This bill will make an enormous difference,'' said Jim Holm of
the Privacy Lobby and the gay rights Dorian Group. ``We've taken a
step toward making it safe to know your antibody status, whether
you're at risk, and safe to seek public health (services).
   ``In this state we've finally said civil rights and public
health go hand-in-hand.''
   ``The important thing is that we did get a statewide policy on
AIDS,'' said state Sen. Alex Deccio, co-sponsor of the measure.
``It's the first omnibus bill of its kind in the country, so I
guess it's the best available.''

   Checks that disintegrate into confetti shortly
after being deposited have cost banks nearly $50,000 this year, the
Chicago Clearing House Association says.
   It warned banks this week to be on the lookout for dissolving
checks, and the FBI has been asked to determine whether the
chemical used to destroy the checks is harmful to humans.
   Northern Trust Bank has been hit by a number of the checks, an
association memo says.
   In one case, a Northern customer deposited a $4,000 check in a
savings account on Feb. 16, then withdrew the same amount a week
later from one of the bank's branch offices, the memo said.
   The $4,000 check was returned to Northern in a check carrier on
March 2, but by then it had been ``reduced to mere confetti, small
bits of paper that appeared to be treated with chemicals that
caused the paper to break into pieces to a point where it was
impossible to identify any information on the check,'' the memo
said.

<HEAD>Northwest Flight Attendants Committee Agrees To Turn Over Pact For
Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union negotiating committee has voted to
submit a tentative contract for ratification by Northwest Airlines'
6,500 flight attendants, says a Teamsters official.
   The 15-member committee met at Teamsters headquarters in
Bloomington and approved the vote Wednesday night, said Jeff Musto,
a Teamsters spokesman.
   ``My personal feeling is that yes, they will ratify it,'' Musto
said.
   It will take about 30 days to complete the vote, he said.
   Musto declined to release details of the tentative accord,
although he earlier confirmed that the contract will require all
flight attendants to join the union.
   Both sides said the March 29 strike deadline, set by the flight
attendants last week, provided the impetus for an agreement.
   The key issue has been Northwest's two-tier wage structure. The
airline had proposed extending the lower-paid, B-scale to eight
years from the current five years.
   B-scale flight attendants said the airline was trying to break a
promise that they would earn A-scale wages after five years.
   The Star Tribune of Minneapolis, citing unidentified sources,
reported today that the tentative agreement calls for B-scale
employees to move up after seven years.

   A man whose conviction on a charge of
failing to comply with peacetime draft registration rules was
overturned says he has spent quite enough time in jail.
   ``I think there's a strong argument to be made that the
government should not retry this case at all, since I've already
served more time than most people convicted of failing to
register,'' said Gillam Kerley, whose conviction was thrown out
Wednesday by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Kerly served four months of his sentence.
   The appeals court ruled that U.S. District Judge John Shabaz
gave the jury flawed instructions.
   Shabaz sentenced Kerley to three years in prison and fined him
$10,000, one of the most severe sentences in a draft case since the
Vietnam War.
   U.S. Attorney Patrick Fiedler said he would review the decision
before deciding whether to seek a new trial.
   Kerley pleaded ``not guilty by reason of sanity'' in 1982 to a
federal indictment for failing to register. He fought the
government for 4{ years as his own attorney before being convicted
last April.

   Richard Gephardt will end his campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination and file for re-election to his
Missouri House seat if he doesn't win the Michigan caucuses on
Saturday, a campaign aide said today.
   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the aide said Gephardt
would probably announce the end of his campaign on Monday and file
for re-election to his House seat by the Tuesday afternoon deadline.
   ``He will be out if he doesn't win in Michigan,'' said the aide.
   While Gephardt's spokesmen officially denied any decision has
been made, the congressman's wife told a radio interviewer that the
end may be near.
   ``I think Dick has to come in first or a real strong second to
remain in the race, because at some point if you don't do well
here, it becomes difficult to raise money,'' she told WTVB radio in
Coldwater, Mich. ``Dick's message will be very popular in the
industrial states, but if we don't do well here, we will not be
able to continue.''
   Gephardt is running third in the polls in Michigan behind
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson. Gephardt is
badly in need of a win after a weak showing in the Super Tuesday
contests earlier this month.
   The aide also said some consideration was being given to
Gephardt's ending his presidential bid even if he wins in Michigan.
   ``Only as Rep. Gephardt can he raise the money to pay off the
debts'' from the presidential campaign, the aide said.
   Spokesmen for Gephardt denied that a decision has been made.
   ``This notion that the decision has been made before the results
are in is false,'' said Mark Johnson in Washingon.
   Johnson also said that the campaign ``does not have a large
debt. We have virtually no bank debt. ... We have some vendor
debts.''
   ``There's never been any question that if the presidential
effort was not successful that Dick would probably run for his
House seat,'' said Ali Webb, Gephardt spokeswoman in Detroit.
``He's going to pursue his political agenda and his issues for this
country from the House, if not from the presidency. But right now,
he's running for president.''
   Publicly, Gephardt on Wednesday refused to link his showing in
Michigan to his candidacy.
   Asked if his Saturday's results would make or break his
campaign, Gephardt said, ``That's unthinkable.''
   ``All decisions are made in due time,'' he said.
   Earlier, a St. Louis Democratic leader said a weekend meeting
was scheduled among the Democratic contenders for Gephardt's
congressional seat.
   The Dallas Times Herald reported today that the participants at
that meeting would be told Gephardt was preparing to seek
re-election to the House instead of the White House.
   ``We're getting the major candidates together and talking about
procedure and unity, said the Democratic leader, Tony Ribaudo.
``That's normal in St. Louis politics. I don't know what Dick
Gephardt's going to do.''
   State Rep. Philip Barry of St. Louis County, one of the leading
contenders for the congressional seat, told the Times Herald the
meeting would be attended by six candidates who have filed for
Gephardt's seat, plus a St. Louis alderman who is expected to file
if Gephardt decides not to seek re-election.
   One of the candidates, George Kerry, an administrative aide in
Gephardt's St. Louis office, told The Assoiated Press Wednesday
night that he knew nothing of the meeting.
   Kerry, who has said he would drop out of the race if Gephardt
files for re-election, said he understood Gephardt was waiting to
see how he fared in Michigan on Saturday before making a decision.

<TEXT>
   The nation's federally insured savings
institutions lost $3.2 billion in the last three months of 1987,
pushing the industry's losses for the year to a post-Depression
record of $6.8 billion, the government said today.
   The industry, composed of 3,147 thrift institutions, had earned
$132 million a year earlier. The 1987 loss was nearly 50 percent
greater than the previous record of $4.6 billion, set in 1981, when
the prime lending rate soared above 20 percent.
   The fourth quarter loss compared to a loss of $1.8 billion in
the third quarter, 1.9 billion in the spring quarter and a profit
of $100 million in the first three months of 1987.
   James Barth, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, which released the figures, said losses were heavily
concentrated in the Southwest, which is dependent on the ailing oil
and gas industry.
   Sixty-six percent of the institutions nationwide reported a
total profit of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, while the 1,058
unprofitable S&Ls lost $4.5 billion in all.
   For the year, the profitable two-thirds of the industry earned
$6.6 billion, which was more than offset by the $13.4 billion
deficit of the money-losing S&Ls.
   The percentage of the industry earning a profit has steadily
declined for two years, from 81 percent in the first quarter of
1986 to 66 percent at the end of last year.
   Barth said the worst 20 institutions _ most of them in the
Southwest _ lost a total of $2.1 billion in the final quarter of
last year, accounting for two-thirds of the overall industry loss.
   Barth said 345 of the S&Ls were insolvent at the end of 1987
under regulatory accounting principles and 510 were insolvent under
the stricter, generally accepted accounting principles that will be
used beginning next year.
   An institution is considered insolvent when its loans and other
assets are worth less than what it owes to depositors and other
creditors.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the fund backing
deposits up to $100,000 in federally insured S&Ls, has been
hampered in closing insolvent S&Ls by lack of money. Congress in
August authorized a three-year, $10.8 billion recapitalization.
   Last month, the bank board announced a plan to spend $6 billion
to $7 billion in insurance fund money to close insolvent Texas
institutions or merge them into healthier S&Ls. The bank board is
still accepting applications from private investors to participate
in the restructuring and doesn't plan any announcements before
early April.
   The nation's 13,700 federally insured commercial banks earned
$3.7 billion last year, their lowest profit since 1933, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. reported earlier this month.

   The Senate Judiciary Committee approved by

individuals who were exposed to radiation when the United States
tested atomic weapons.
   The measure, whose chief sponsor is Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.,
would repeal a provision of a 1985 Defense Department bill that
curtailed sharply the legal rights of civilians and veterans who
participated in the atomic testing program.
   Until 1985, radiation victims could file suit against
contractors who participated in the testing programs. The 1985 act
shifted the target of radiation suits from defense contractors to

<HEAD>Stockman Leaving Salomon For Blackstone Group</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE with Blackstone statement. A

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David A. Stockman, the former White House budget
director, is leaving the investment firm Salomon Brothers to join
its smaller rival Blackstone Group, it was announced today.
   Stockman, a managing director at Salomon since leaving the White
House in 1985, will handle all merchant banking activities and
merger transactions for the Blackstone Group, the company said.
   His departure from Salomon comes against a background of turmoil
within the venerable investment firm, a partial result of the
uncertain outlook for Wall Street in the aftermath of the stock
market crash five months ago.
   Several other high-ranking executives also have quit Salomon
recently, although Stockman was quoted by The New York Times today
as saying his departure was unrelated to the company's problems.
   ``My experience at Salomon was absolutely agreeable and I have a
high regard for (Salomon chairman) John Gutfreund,'' Stockman said.
``...There's one thing I couldn't do there _ which is have my own
shop.''
   Former Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson, chairman of
Blackstone, said that Stockman will take charge of a jointly owned
firm called ``Stockman & Co. _ a Blackstone Group affiliate.''
   Peterson said he wanted Stockman to bolster Blackstone's
emerging merchant banking business in Japan.
   ``Dave Stockman will be an immensely valuable asset in meeting
that goal,'' he said. ``He brings a global perspective on business
and financial issues as well as intimate familiarity with both U.S.
and Japanese government policies.''
   Blackstone recently represented Sony in a $2 billion acquisition
of CBS Records late last year and represented Firestone Tire &
Rubber Co. in its $2.6 billion acquisition by Japan's Bridgestone
Corp.
   Stockman, 41, was White House budget director from 1981 to 1985.

   Two passenger trains collided head-on today in a
Shanghai suburb, killing 12 people and injuring more than 40, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency said. It was China's fourth fatal
train accident in three months.
   China's second official news agency, the China News Service,
said only seven were dead, including five Japanese, a Chinese
soldier and a railway worker. It said 40 to 50 people were
hospitalized.
   The Japanese Embassy confirmed that a 193-member Japanese high
school tour group was on one of the trains. It said the Japan
Travel Bureau, which arranged the tour, reported two Japanese
killed and 29 injured.
   Xinhua said 11 Japanese were killed.
   The cause of the collision in the Shanghai suburb of Fengbang
was not immediately clear, said Fu Fenghao, chief of the Shanghai
Foreign Affairs Office's public relations division.
   Xinhua, however, said one of the trains ignored a stop signal
when it left the Shanghai station.
   The crash occurred at about 2 p.m. when northbound train No.
311, leaving Shanghai for Hangzhou, collided with southbound train
No. 208 arriving from Changsha, Fu said.
   No. 311's first two cars and the luggage car of No. 208 were
knocked off the tracks, he said.
   Television footage by Japanese camera crews broadcast in Japan
showed the luggage car resting on one end of the other train's
engine. The China News Service said the two first-class passenger
cars behind the No. 311 engine were crushed together by the force
of the collision.
   The news service said Shanghai had rain and heavy fog today but
did not say if this was believed to have contributed to the
accident.
   Xinhua said the No. 311 train ``rolled out of the Kuangxiang
station, ignoring the prohibiting signal, and collided with the No.
208 train that was entering the station.''
   Kengo Kobayashi of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing said two
people from a high school in southern Japan's Kochi Prefecture were
among the dead, and 29 others were injured.
   Fu confirmed that Japanese students were among the dead and
injured but said the number was not yet determined.
   ``We haven't heard any information about other nationalities,''
he added.
   ``We were playing cards and suddenly there was a loud bang, and
things went flying all over the floor,'' said an unidentified male
student interviewed in Shanghai by the Japan Broadcasting Corp.
   ``There was a huge bump, and then one of our teachers came into
the car and told us to get out,'' said another student. ``We broke
the windows and climbed out.''
   The train tracks were blocked seven hours after the accident, Fu
said. He said soldiers, police and medical workers took the dead
and injured to nearby hospitals and that investigators were at the
scene trying to determine the cause.
   Shanghai Vice Mayor Huang Ju also went to the scene, the China
News Service said.
   In January, three separate train accidents killed 141 people.
China's minister of railways resigned this month to take
responsibility for those accidents.
   This year's train accidents, together with a plane crash outside
Chungking in January that killed all 108 people aboard, have
prompted severe calls by the Beijing government for greater
attention to safety.

   A pair of barges loaded with a flammable liquid
today slammed into the end of the Pensacola Fishing Pier, a former
bridge billed as the world's longest fishing pier.
   The barges were wedged into the L-shaped vehicular turnaround at
the tip of the pier, formerly a highway bridge across Pensacola Bay
connecting Pensacola and Gulf Breeze. The bridge was divided into
two sections, each becoming fishing piers. The Pensacola pier is
1.5 miles long.
   ``The wind caught it and blew him into the bridge (pier),'' said
Grey Jewett, risk manager for Escambia County, which owns the pier.
``It destroyed the end of the pier, a turnaround. It's not
reparable.''
   The pier is only 75 feet away from the new Pensacola Bay Bridge.
Officials said they planned to block traffic on the new, four-lane
bridge while attempts were made to pull the barges, which were tied
together along with a towboat, from the pier.
   The barges were loaded with benzine, a colorless, flammable
liquid used as a motor fuel and solvent in dry cleaning.
   None of the benzine apparently leaked, but officials were
worried about possible fire or explosion.
   ``It's not the benzine, it's the vapor,'' said Chuck Ramsey, an
engineering technician for the county. ``It would go with one
spark.''
   One of the barges was pushed into the shipping channel, blocking
navigation traffic.

<TEXT>
   Six Disneyland Hotel workers who rebelled
against the Magic Kingdom's ban on facial hair were suspended for
three days without pay and given an order to shave or be fired.
   The hotel's 1,600 workers recently came under the famed
amusement park's dress and grooming codes when their former boss,
the Wrather Corp., sold the property to the Walt Disney Co.
   The dress code, established in 1957, bans facial hair on men,
mandates short haircuts and bars women from wearing heavy makeup,
long fingernails or excessive jewelry.
   The six suspended Wednesday have until Monday to shave or lose
their jobs, said Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth.
   A dozen male employees have been issued warnings for facial
hair, and although half of those shaved, all 12 filed grievances
with their unions.
   Earlier Wednesday, the five unions representing hotel workers
united in opposition to the Disney dress code, but wouldn't say
whether they were willing to strike over it.

   A Hindu occult priest strangled a
7-year-old girl to offer her blood to a goddess in a ritual and
stored her body in his temple complex, it was reported Thursday.
   The priest, Narayan Gangadhar Poojary, and four others were
arrested after residents of Manpada village in the central Indian
Maharashtra state complained of a foul smell and called police, the
Hindustan Times and Patriot newspapers said.
   Police Inspector R.M. Patil said the body of the girl,
identified as Nandita Shinde, was found in the loft of a building
near the temple. It was hidden in fodder and cow dung.
   Police said the priest apparently called the girl inside the
temple Friday, the newspapers said. He was believed to have
strangled her and cut an artery in her left leg to draw blood for
the ritual offering aimed at pleasing a goddess, they said.
   Human sacrifices are outlawed in India, but still occur from
time to time, mainly in rural areas.

   Here's a sampling of what newspapers abroad are saying about the
U.S. presidential election campaign and the candidates seeking the
Republican and Democratic nominations:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Times of London (conservative), on Democrat Michael
Dukakis: ``The rest of the world should start thinking about a
possible President Dukakis. And a possible President Dukakis should
start thinking about the rest of the world.
   ``His apparent ignorance of it will provoke the traditional
censoriousness about American politicians, not just from Europeans,
but from well-bred Americans. ...
   ``Unlike most American politicians, Mr. Dukakis speaks a foreign
language (Spanish). This means he addresses the newly-important
Hispanic vote in its mother tongue. If it means much else, it is
something to worry about. If American politicians start addressing
special groups of voters in languages unintelligible to the
majority, it is one more denial of the notion of America as melting
pot.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Independent of London (independent), on George Bush: ``It
is tempting to conclude that he achieved this pre-eminent position
because of the errors and failings of his opponents rather than
through his own efforts. It is true that his chief rival, Sen.
Robert Dole, has had a disastrous campaign following his one
transient success in Iowa. But to give Mr. Bush credit, his
campaign has been almost faultless and it was largely due to his
good organization and well-lined campaign coffers that he was able
to recover so convincingly after the setback in Iowa.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ITALY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _La Repubblica, national (liberal): ``The dilemma that confronts
the candidates is not between the `poor' and the `rich.' ... The
dilemma is in the schizophrenia of middle America, divided by the
desire not to change anything and the fear of not being able to
stay the same.
   ``This uncertainty, more than the fear of confronting the
unknown in the cursed equation `Italian equals Mafia', is the real
calculation that has kept Mario Cuomo out of the competition. His
capital of expectations and fascination is too big to be gambled
today on the roulette of the American mood in 1988.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MALAYSIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _New Straits Times of Kuala Lumpur, English language
(pro-government): ``Democrat Richard Gephardt terrified Americans
about the invasion of cheaper foreign goods.
   ``His clarion call to raise high the trade barriers in
retaliation for unfair trade practices summoned few followers to
the barricades, and his campaign should be spluttering to a halt
soon.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JAPAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Japan Times of Tokyo, English-language (independent): `` ...
this year's most watchable `devil' _ at least as far as Japan was
concerned _ was laid low by (Super Tuesday's) results. We are
referring, of course, to the forceful voice of articulate, and
therefore frightening, nationalistic protectionism: Democratic
Congressman Richard Gephardt of Missouri. ... But Tuesday's outcome
almost certainly ensures that he will not be the Democratic Party
standard bearer in November.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRAZIL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Political columnist Paulo Francis, writing from New York in
Folha de S. Paulo (liberal), on the Connecticut primaries March 29:
``Connecticut has more millionaires per square meter than anywhere
else in the United States. Any doubts about the winner? There are
liberal millionaires here _ many more than people in Brazil think _
such as the two senators from Connecticut, Lowell Weicker, a
Republican, and Christopher Dodd, a Democrat. ... We presume that
on the Democratic side these liberals will reinforce Dukakis, the
least bad of the Democratic candidates. ...
   ``The George Bush `express' seems unstoppable. ... However, he's
not as bad as Brazilians might imagine. He's from the East Coast
elite. And there was a time when this liberal elite dominated, or
at least heavily influenced, the Republican Party.''

communist homeland, West German police said Thursday.
   The escape took place Wednesday night in the Upper Franken
section of the region, according to Munich police. The man was not

   East German guards were seen searching the area after the escape
over the steel-mesh fence. They apparently were tipped off by
electronic sensors on the barriers, police said.
   At least 20 East Germans have fled over their homeland's
fortified barriers into West Germany this year.

   An Iranian slashed his wrists Thursday minutes
before he was due to board a flight deporting him to Turkey,
officials said.
   The Iranian, who was not identified, was taken from Heathrow
Airport to a nearby hospital. A Foreign Office spokesman said he
there was no word on how badly the man was injured.
   The Iranian was being deported to Turkey after being turned down
for political asylum in Britain, largely because he had already
applied for asylum in Turkey where he had been living.
   The Iranian came to Britain while Turkish authorities were still
considering the application, said the spokesman, adding, ``Clearly
he was returnable to Turkey.''
   The spokesman, who in accordance with British practice declined
to be identified, said the Iranian had been living in Turkey for
five months and his wife was there.

   A fire in one of India's largest
munitions depots detonated artillery shells Thursday, forcing
evacuation of two villages and closing an airport.
   Shivraj Patal, minister of state for defense production, told
Parliament that the blaze, which began Wednesday in the central
Indian depot's underground sheds, was largely under control. But he
said sporadic explosions of ammunition continued.
   Army officials told the United News of India news agency that
the blasts in the two sheds could continue for up to 10 days. At
least 10,000 rounds reportedly were stored in the burning areas,
mainly for 105-mm artillery guns.
   Patal said the two villages were evacuated as a precaution after
the blasts in Madhya Pradesh state 155 miles east of Bhopal, the
state capital. Jabalpur's airport 28 miles away was also closed.
   Two depot workers suffered minor injuries in fighting the blaze,
Patal said. There was no word on its cause.

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today
rejected a move by Sen. Jesse Helms to require new intelligence
studies of what Helms says are Soviet missiles unaccounted for by
the U.S.-Soviet treaty on medium-range atomic weapons.
   The committee voted 15-2 against Helms' amendment to the treaty
which would have required President Reagan to certify the accuracy
of the Soviet claims that there are 650 SS-20 missiles. The
declared weapons will have to be destroyed after the treaty takes
effect.
   Helms, R-N.C., argued that up to 300 more SS-20s are ``hidden,''
and he cited Defense Intelligence Agency reports which he said
support his claim.
   But Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., said, ``I don't believe
President Reagan would have signed this treaty'' if he believed the
Soviets had successfully hidden a large force of SS-20 missiles.
   The vote was the latest decision in which the panel decided by
large bipartisan majorities to reject attempts by Helms and Sen.
Larry Pressler, R-S.D., another conservative critic, to change the
treaty.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the committee, said the
panel was headed toward overwhelming approval of the pact.
   ``I would hope _ and I think _ that we will continue to show
strong bipartisan support,'' said Pell after the panel voted by
lopsided margins Wednesday to reject amendments by Helms and
Pressler.
   Helms had originally proposed 36 amendments and Pressler offered
three more, despite appeals from the Reagan administration for the
Senate to approve the treaty without changes.
   After it became apparent he had few votes on his side, Helms
said he planned to drop most of his amendments.
   Pell announced that the committee will finish voting on all
amendments by Tuesday afternoon next week and will then decide on
the treaty itself.
   When the measure finally reaches the floor, overwhelming
approval is expected with no more than 10 to 12 of the 100 senators
expected to vote against it. Ratification requires a two-thirds
vote.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed Dec. 8 by
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, requires
the elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of
300 to 3,400 miles. It includes on-site inspection among its strict
verification provisions.
   Helms dropped many of his amendments after he came under fire
from fellow Republicans, some of whom claimed he was trying to
delay a final Senate vote until after the next summit meeting
between Reagan and Gorbachev.
   That meeting has now been set for May 29-June 2 in Moscow, the
White House announced Wednesday.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said: ``We're just in a delay, stall
situation which I find disagreeable. ... If you don't have the
votes and just try to overload it with amendments, that isn't
fair.''
   Meantime, Pell and other Democrats tried to work out some type
of compromise between Congress and the White House over the chief
remaining hurdle, a dispute about the legal power to interpret
treaties.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said in a floor
speech that it will be necessary to add a reservation or an
understanding which spells out the Senate position.
   ``This matter is not going to be resolved, in my judgment, by
any exchange of letters, because a future administration can say,
`we don't agree with that interpretation at all,''' Byrd said.
   Reagan asserts that the executive branch can unilaterally change
the U.S. intepretation of a treaty, a view disputed by the Senate.
The fight arises from a difference in how to interpret the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   As it worked through the treaty, the panel:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Voted down, 12-3, a Helms proposal to change the treaty and
allow the United States to deploy non-nuclear cruise missiles. The
treaty bans all cruise missiles, whether equipped with nuclear or
conventional warheads, because there is no effective way to verify
which warheads are on the missile.
   _Voted down, 12-2, a Helms amendment which would include the
Soviets' Scud B missile as one of the banned weapons. The missile
is not now banned because it has a shorter range than 300 miles,
but Helms claimed Scud B missiles sold by the Soviets to Iraq have
been fired at ranges which would fall within the INF ranges.
   _Rejected, 13-2, a Helms plan that would prohibit either side
from testing missiles in the INF range.
   _Defeated, 15-2, a Pressler amendment which would block the
treaty from taking effect until Reagan certifies that there is
parity in Europe between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces. The Soviets
have a large advantage in some categories of non-nuclear weapons
and Pressler and other treaty critics say the elimination of
medium-range atomic missiles will take away a major NATO deterrent
to a Soviet attack.

<HEAD>Student Says Dog Immolaton Threat Was A Prank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A philosophy student who outraged people
with his threat to publicly kill a puppy to demonstrate the
brutality of war said today the whole thing was a prank.
   ``It was a prankish threat to kill one mythical animal,'' said
David Read.
   But he said his threat to burn to death a 10-week-old dog at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison campus Monday served its purpose in
getting attention. The threat drew protest calls to the Dane County
Humane Society and local radio stations.
   ``People panicked to save the life of one mythical puppy while
thousands (of people) were dying'' elsewhere, Read said.
   The student said he opposed cruelty to animals and never
intended to carry out his threat, despite earlier claims he was
serious that prompted humane society officials and university
police to investigate.
   Police said Wednesday they would consider seeking an injunction
against Read's plan to kill the dog.
   Earlier, Read said burning the puppy would be ``an exhibition of
what suffering and cruelty is all about,'' he said. ``I think our
attitudes about war and human suffering are complacency and
numbness. This is one thing that will combat that numbness.''
   Read, 26, is chairman of the Nihilist Workers Party, a campus
organization the university said does not have its official
recognition.
   He said the group, organized two years ago, has about 12 active
members who advocate nihilism, a belief that existing social
institutions need destroying to make room for a new order.
   The group announced the puppy-burning plan Tuesday. Radio
stations, humane societies and police said Wednesday they were
flooded with telephone calls.
   Read said he anticipated the reaction. ``I'm quite pleased,'' he
said. ``I'm the most reviled character in town.''
   He said he had Nicaragua in mind when he conceived of the idea
of burning the dog to demonstrate suffering. He said people living
in the United States lead sheltered, comfortable lives and avoid
thinking about the horrors occurring in other nations.
   ``I want them to get down and wallow in the filth, which is
truth,'' he said.
   Shock is the best method of making people aware of ugliness, he
said, calling peaceful protest a waste of time.
   His organization has distributed obscene posters on the campus,
including one portraying Adolph Hitler pointing a gun and reading:
``I love you.''

   Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker cautioned presidential candidates on Thursday to avoid
``Washington bashing'' in their campaigning,
   Volcker spoke to a House civil service subcommittee as chairman
of the National Commission on the Public Service. His 37-member
panel is working on recommendations for making civil service more
attractive to talented individuals.
   While the presidential candidates don't seem to be ``running
against Washington'' this year, Volcker hinted he's ready with a
strong lecture for anyone who tries such an approach.
   ``We're never very far from the telephone,'' Volcker said. ``We
will try to keep after those candidates. ... We will urge them to
stay on the high road.''
   He suggested attacks by candidates on Washington institutions
have hurt the image of public service. Volcker called it ``the
Washington bashing syndrome.''
   ``Too many of the best at the upper ranks have been leaving
government, with not enough of quality being recruited at the entry
level,'' said Volcker, who retired from government service last
summer.
   Volcker, who worked for the governmment most of his life,
including eight years as head of the nation's central bank,
recently became a professor at Princeton University and chairman of
a small New York investment firm.
   Rep. Patricia Shroeder, D-Colo., chairwoman of the subcommittee,
told Volcker: ``Hopefully, we can head off a race in which everyone
sees how bad a thing they can say about public service.''
   ``The last two presidents have gratuitously slandered the
bureaucracy,'' said Ms. Schroeder, who was mentioned as a possible
1988 presidential contender herself before she withdrew from
consideration.
   Norman Ornstein, a political analyst with the American
Enterprise Institute who serves with Volcker on the commission,
told the subcommittee that ``we've been seeing a change'' toward
the positive in public attitudes toward government service.
   ``Part of this is the ironic success President Reagan has had in
getting people to feel better about the government. It's ironic
because I don't think he meant it that way. He had two campaigns
against Washington.''
   ``No candidates this time have picked up on the theme of bashing
government and bashing bureaucrats,'' Ornstein added. ``There is a
good climate to create a different set of attitudes.''
   Members of the commission also include former President Gerald
Ford and former Vice President Walter Mondale.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said today he was willing
to release information on more than $1 million in loans taken out
by his presidential campaign, but members of his staff who heard
the senator's remarks said no decision had been made on the matter.
   Gore's pledge to release the material came in the wake of a
report in a Nashville, Tenn., newspaper that his campaign had put
up the proceeds of future fund-raisers and federal matching funds
as collateral for almost $1.5 million borrowed from banks about two
weeks ago.
   ``I have no problem with telling you the amount of the loans and
which banks they came from, be glad to,'' Gore said at a news
conference.
   Gore said details of the loans would be contained in reports to
be filed in the next two or three weeks with the Federal Election
Commission ``so if you can wait two or three weeks all of that will
be available, but as for now I have no problem with giving you the
amount of the loans, the banks et cetera.''
   However, Gore aide Mark Armour said as the candidate was leaving
the news conference that no decision had been made on releasing the
information.
   The Gore campaign previously has acknowledged only that it had
established a $1 million line of credit to be used as necessary for
television advertising on Super Tuesday.
   Gore borrowed $750,000 from Sovran Bank-D.C. National, a
Washington-based bank which handles his campaign accounts, The
Tennessean reported. The remainder of the loans came from a
collection of small banks in Tennessee, the Democrat's home state,
the newspaper said.
   Each of the banks has strong Democratic Party and Gore ties, the
paper said. Officials at each of the banks refused to comment on
whether Gore had received a loan.
   Gore's staff has refused to give any details of campaign loans.
   Gore pledged future federal matching funds against the Sovran
loan, a standard presidential campaign procedure, The Tennessean
reported, quoting sources familiar with the transaction.
   At the Tennessee banks, the candidate pledged the proceeds of
future fund-raising events, and in at least some cases, guaranteed
10 percent of the note on his personal signature, the report said.
   ``The Gore campaign has made complete disclosure of our finances
every four weeks as required by the Federal Election Commission,''
campaign manager Fred Martin said Wednesday.
   ``For me to disclose the details of our finances before the FEC
reporting date would be to give key strategic information to the
other candidates a full month before they are entitled to have it
and that would be a disservice to my campaign,'' he said.
   The next FEC reporting date is April 20. The loans were taken
out after Feb. 29 so they did not have to be disclosed March 20.
   Gore campaign officials talked with a number of Tennessee banks
about participating in the loans, which were used to finance a
media blitz before the March 8 primaries and caucuses in 20 states,
the paper says. Gore won five of those contests.
   Federal Election Commission laws and regulations require that
any loans be transacted ``in the ordinary course of business,''
have a written instrument, have a due date or amortization
schedule, and be subject to ``the usual and customary rate of
interest'' charged by the bank.
   The due date for the Gore loans is July 15, three days before
the Democratic National Convention begins in Atlanta.
   The latest Gore FEC disclosure, made public Sunday, covers the
period from Feb. 1 to Feb. 29.
   It shows that, to date, Gore has spent $6 million on his
presidential bid, and had $342,964 in cash on hand as of Feb. 29.
   Campaign sources have said Gore's bid raised almost $1 million
in the first 15 days of March, the paper reported.

<HEAD>Ferry Workers Protest in Channel-blocking Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 350 government workers demonstrated Thursday
in a week-old strike that has virtually halted ferry service across
the English Channel.
   A delegation of protesters met with Pierre-Olivier Drege, chief
of staff for the Secretary of State for Maritime Affairs, where the
protest was held.
   Government officials refused to comment afterward, saying the
conflict must be settled by the sailors' employer, the state-run
railroad.
   Railroad officials have said they will not negotiate with the
strikers until they end their occupation of the ferry Nord-Pas de
Calais.
   The strikers are protesting what they say is a threatened
privatization of their company and loss of purchasing power. On the
other side of the Channel, about 2,200 employees of P and O
European Ferries have been striking for seven weeks.
   Thursday's demonstrators arrived in buses from the French port
cities of Boulogne, Calais, Dieppe and Dunkirk. They represented
about a third of the 990 officers and sailors working on ferries
for the railroads' maritime arm.
   Traffic remained backed up at Channel ports on the French side
Thursday, where only one ferry _ with a British crew _ was in
operation between Calais and the British port of Dover.

<HEAD>Hawks Have Almost Human-Like Ability To Stalk Prey, Researcher
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time after time, the big jackrabbit avoids
attacks by the five Harris hawks that dive and feint with the
precision of a military unit. But finally, the rabbit is exhausted
and a powerful talon slashes quickly. The hunt ends and winged
predators feed together.
   In a report to be published Friday in Science magazine,
biologist James C. Bednarz said he repeatedly witnessed such
coordinated hunting by Harris hawks. It is, he said, the first
documented proof that hawks are able to organize and cooperate with
almost human skill in such a complex series of manuevers.
   ``People have suggested it in the past, but this is the first
documentation of it,'' said Bednarz, who is director of higher
education research at the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in Kempton, Pa.,
and an associate professor at the University of New Mexico.
   ``We expected to see two hawks hunting together. I was amazed to
see units of four, five and six hawks. ... We got to see it
repeatedly,'' Bednarz said in a telephone interview.
   Cooperative hunting, in which predators work together to kill
prey larger than they could bring down individually, is well known
among lions, wolves, hyenas, wild dogs, killer whales _ and humans.
But Bednarz said his study shows that hawks also are able to hunt
together for their mutual benefit.
   In more than 400 hours of observations at the Los Medanos Raptor
Area near Carlsbad, N.M., Bednarz said he watched groups of five to
six hawks use two basic coordinated attacks to bring down rabbits.
   Bednarz said the most common tactic, which he called the
surprise pounce, required the hawks to attack a rabbit from several
different directions at once, forcing it to stay away from cover.
   ``They will work the rabbit in such a way that it becomes
mentally and physically exhausted,'' Bednarz said. ``They keep it
moving and keep it making decisions until it makes the wrong
decision.''
   Bednarz said if the rabbit leaves its back unprotected, a hawk
swoops in and delivers a lethal blow to the back of the neck.
That's the only way, said Bednarz, that a Harris hawk, which weighs
about 2 pounds, can kill a jackrabbit, which can weigh as much as 7
pounds.
   Another tactic Bednarz observed is what he calls the ``flush and
ambush.''
   A team of hawks, e said, will chase a rabbit until it finally
takes cover. Two or three hawks will perch nearby and a pair of the
birds will land near the rabbit and try to flush it from the cover.
When the bunny finally flees, the perched hawks drop swiftly for
the kill.
   Even dinner time is coordinated for the Harris hawks, Bednarz
said.
   When the hawks are feeding, two of the group will remain at a
nearby high place, on the lookout for eagles or ospreys or other
species who might try to steal the kill. When an intruder is
spotted, the sentinel will sound an alarm and the Harris hawks rise
and attack together, usually chasing away the invader.
   Bednarz said most of the hawk groups that hunt together are
extended families that may include a mated pair, yearlings and
older offspring. The group usually is no larger than six.
   The female is the larger of the Harris hawks and usually
dominates the group, Bednarz said. But on the hunt, the female is
less likely to attack the prey and more likely to play ``a
distractor role.''
   ``She distracts the prey and keeps it in play for the other
hawks, forcing it back into the area of vulnerability,'' the
researcher said.
   He said birds seem to communicate with body movement. As the
hunt begins, he birds will perch hundreds of yards apart. When one
of the hawks sights a possible meal, its movement quickly attracts
the other birds and the hunt is on, Bednarz said.
   Harris hawks live in the deserts of Texas, Arizona and New
Mexico. They feed on rodents and lizards during part of the year,
but apparently hunt together to bring down jackrabbits and desert
cottontail rabbits in the winter months.

   The federal judge in the Iran-Contra case
indicated Thursday that trial of a Florida lawsuit that accuses
former government officials of collaborating with Colombian drug
dealers may be postponed.
   The civil lawsuit is set for trial June 26. The 29 defendants in
the case include Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim, two
businessmen who have been charged with conpiracy and theft in the
Iran-Contra case.
   Secord and Hakim, along with Oliver L. North and John M.
Poindexter, were arraigned before Judge Gerhard Gesell Thursday in
U.S. District Court.
   During the proceedings, Secord's lawyer, Thomas Green, told
Gesell about a potential conflict in scheduling between the
Iran-Contra case and the case in Miami's federal court.
   ``It will not go forward,'' Gesell said. ``A criminal case takes
precedence. This case has got to take priority.''
   Gesell said: ``I've cancelled every case I have and I've
cancelled my vacation.''
   Secord and Hakim are accused of helping North and Poindexter,
two former White House aides, secretly sell weapons to Iran and
divert the profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The Florida lawsuit was filed by Martha Honey and Tony Avirgan,
two freelance reporters based in Costa Rica. They are represented
by The Christic Institute, a liberal policy group.
   The lawsuit accuses the defendants of drug-trafficking,
gun-running and plotting assassinations. The defendants have denied
the charges.

<HEAD>Countries Coordinate War Against `Tidal Wave' of Locusts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billions of locusts are moving across
North Africa in the worst plague since 1954, blotting out the sun
and settling on the land like a black, ravenous carpet to strip it
clean of vegetation.
   Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia have put aside political
differences to fight the locusts, with help from the United States,
Western Europe and the Soviet Union, but a U.N. official said
Thursday it may not be possible to save the food supply.
   As many as 250,000 of the insects settle on each acre whent the
horde alights. They devour 100,000 tons of crops and other
vegetation at each stop, according to the Food and Agriculture
Organization, a U.N. agency based in Rome.
   Wind currents pushed the insects into northeastern Africa from
their breeding grounds, The FAO said. They fly in waves of up to 50
million per square kilometer over 400 square kilometers, which
means as many as 20 billion covering an area of 160 square miles.
   ``We are facing a very dangerous situation, which may affect
North Africa's food production for years to come,'' said Lukas
Brader, director of FAO's Emergency Center for Locust Operations.
``We are not optimistic that the situation can be effectively
controlled.''
   He said the current infestation is worse than the 1950s plague,
which lasted more than 10 years. Breeding has been aided by
abundant rains and heat in the area, Brader said.
   Edouard Saouma, director-general of the FAO, said in a
statement: ``We are in a state of general alert. Swift and decisive
action is needed to avoid a major regional food crisis later this
year.''
   Brader said $30 million had been donated by the United States,
Western Europe, the Soviet Union and others to finance the spraying
of pesticide on infested areas. He said at least $150 million will
be needed to fight the plague, which he said may peak in late
summmer.
   Algeria has sprayed more than 494,000 acres of land and Morocco
has been treating about 62,000 acres a day. No figures were
available for Tunisia.
   Published reports in Algiers say more than 40 aircraft have been
provided by Libya, the Soviet Union, France and Spain to spray crop
and pasture land threatened by locusts.
   Spraying has been hampered by inadequate and outdated pesticide
and equipment, the presence of nomads in some infested regions and
the difficulty of detecting locusts in areas of sand, rock and
scrubland, officials said.
   No estimate was available of the total damage to crops.
   Specialists say the locusts originated near the Red Sea,
invading Sudan and Chad and then swarming through the Sahel
countries below the Sahara Desert before moving north ``in a tidal
wave.'' Libya and Mauritania also are threatened.
   To coordinate logistics the Algerian agriculture minister,
Noureddine Keddara, visited Tunisia on Wednesday and Driss Basri,
Morocco's interior and information minister, was in Algiers.
   Until about two weeks ago, a long-standing territorial dispute
over the Western Sahara had stymied the exchange of information
between Morocco and Algeria about the common danger.

<HEAD>Poor Pay Disproportionately More in Sales Taxes, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's poorest families, with incomes
averaging less than $8,600 a year, pay five times as much of their
earnings for state sales and excise taxes as those who make more
than $600,000, a research and advocacy group reported Thursday.
   ``The less you make, the worse you do,'' Robert S. McIntyre,
director of Citizens for Tax Justice, said in releasing a
comprehensive study of taxes in the 50 states. The unfairness is
especially bad in states that impose heavy taxes on food,
utilities, tobacco and fuels, he said.
   It is not just the poor who spend a disproportionate share on
sales and excise taxes, such as those applying to alcohol, gasoline
and tobacco, the study found. A four-member family earning $31,000
a year spends three times as much of its income on these taxes,
compared with the richest Americans.
   Sales and excise taxes generally are at a flat rate, meaning
that in a state with a 5 percent tax that applies to food, for
example, the rich and poor would pay the same $1 tax on a $20 bag
of groceries.
   Citizens for Tax Justice, which is financed by labor unions and
liberal social organizations, opposes such ``consumption taxes''
because they are not based on ability to pay. There is some support
in Congress for a national sales tax to replace at least part of
the income tax.
   McIntyre, whose organization was a major influence in the
thorough revision of the federal income tax enacted in 1986, said
some ``tax reformers'' spend too much time in pursuit of the
perfect income tax while ignoring the onerous burden that sales
taxes create for the poor.
   ``That's a mistake, because the worst state income tax in the
nation is still a far sight fairer than any state sales tax,'' he
said.
   In 23 states, the disparity between shares of income taken by
sales and excise taxes is worse than the national average, the
report said.
   The poor in South Dakota and Mississippi pay about seven times
as much of their earnings in sales and excise taxes as do the rich;
in Tennessee, Alabama and Louisiana, almost six times as much.
   The study found:
   _The poorest 20 percent of four-member families, averaging
income of $8,581, paid 5.4 percent of their earnings in sales and
excise taxes last year.
   _The second one-fifth, averaging $20,535, paid 3.9 percent.
   _The third, averaging $31,497, paid 3.3 percent.
   _The fourth, averaging $44,910, paid 2.9 percent.
   _The highest-earning one-fifth, averaging $66,912, paid 2.5
percent.
   _The top-earning 5 percent, averaging $187,316, paid 1.6 percent.
   _Four-member families averaging $612,122 a year _ the richest
0.7 percent of Americans _ paid 1.1 percent of their incomes for
sales and excise taxes.
   Until states begin relying more on income taxes, McIntyre said,
sales taxes can be made less onerous by extending rebates to the
poor. The taxes also could be applied disproportionately to
services that are generally used by the well-to-do, such as club
memberships and home-improvement services, he suggested.
   Only six states have sales-tax credits for the poor, and only in
New Mexico does the credit offset more than half of the burden for
low-income people. The other five are Kansas, Vermont, Idaho,
Hawaii and North Carolina.
   Sixteen states, including the 10 with the most onerous sales
taxes on the poor, all tax food, the study found. They are Alabama,
Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Arkansas,
Tennessee, South Dakota, Virginia and Hawaii.
   The poor spend 6.2 percent of income on electrical bills, more
than double the rate of the middle-income family. But that
middle-income family pays three times as big a share for
electricity as do the rich, the study found.
   The portion of the $600,000-a-year family's income spent for tax
on take-home beer is only 15 percent of the $8,600 family's share.
   On cigarettes, the upper-income family's share is 1 percent of
the low-income family's; on gasoline, 4 percent; on fresh flowers,
98 percent; on legal fees, 100 percent; jewelry, 259 percent; wine
for home consumption, 324 percent, and out-of-town lodging, 613
percent.

<HEAD>Experts Urge Next Administration To Put Mideast Peace on Front
Burner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of Mideast experts on Thursday urged
the next U.S. administration to place Mideast peace talks high on
its foreign policy agenda and to include negotiators approved by
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``A prolonged impasse in the peace process could endanger
American national interests,'' the panel of 19 academicians and
former State Department officials said in a report issued by the
Brookings Institution, which sponsored the study.
   ``We would like to see a steady, high-level commitment of
American resources to the Arab-Israeli peace process,'' the report
said.
   Samuel Lewis, who served as U.S. ambassador to Israel from 1978
to 1985, said the panel ``has a very strong sense that it's going
to take a protracted investment by senior levels to achieve even
partial success.''
   Speaking at a news conference, Lewis said the Mideast peace plan
offered in 1982 by President Reagan lacked sufficient preparation,
while the one currently being proposed by Secretary of State George
P. Shultz may be the victim of bad timing.
   Any future U.S. plan must be presented at a time when both Arabs
and Israelis are ready for peace talks, he said.
   The Palestinians may be too ``eupohoric'' over their success in
the 3{-month uprising against the Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to be ready for the compromises each side must
make in negotiations, Lewis said.
   William Quandt, a senior research fellow at Brookings and the
project's coordinator, said the Mideast peace issue has not been
high on the U.S.-Soviet agenda so far. It should be explored in
that framework further to see if it can yield some solutions, he
added.
   The report's authors agreed that Israeli-Arab peace talks should
be conducted within an international framework, although such a
forum would not be empowered to impose solutions. The Shultz plan
contains a similar proviso.
   ``Palestinians should be represented in any negotiations with
Israel by spokesmen of their own choosing, whether in a joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation or in some other configuration,''
the report said.
   The Shultz plan envisions Palestinian representation as part of
a Jordanian delegation in peace talks. ``The tone, though, seems to
be that Jordan can choose the Palestinians,'' Quandt said.
   ``Palestinians are unlikely to come forward to negotiate with
Israel without having the implicit endorsement of the Palestine
Liberation Organization,'' the report said. Israel and the United
States refuse to negotiate with the PLO directly.
   Quandt said panel members differed on whether the PLO should be
included in negotiations, and also could not agree on whether
Palestinians should be given an independent state. Some argued that
inclusion of the PLO and the establishment of a Palestinian state
would be ``irritants'' that Israel would reject, he said.
   The experts believe substantial preparation is needed to get the
parties ``to be willing to make hard choices'' before bringing them
to the negotiating table, Quandt said.
   Shultz and other officials have conducted preparatory talks with
Israeli and Arab leaders since January, but the United States is
pressing for negotiations to begin by May 1.

   Dozens of honest citizens showed up at police
stations across the city Thursday to return thousands of dollars in
cash that fell out of an armored truck, police said.
   ``We have a lot of very honest people here,'' said Inspector Jim
Shaw.
   On Wednesday night, however, money-grabbing chaos erupted on
Toronto's Gardiner Expressway after the rear door of the armored
truck flew open and spewed a blizzard of bills that blew onto
windshields and covered the highway.
   Drivers stopped their cars in the middle of the road in the rush
for cash, and traffic was tied up for miles.
   A guard in the Loomis Armored Car Service truck eventually had
to pull his gun to halt the free-for-all.
   Two bags that each contained $75,000 _ worth about $60,000 U.S.
_ were scooped up by drivers who threw the booty into their cars
and sped away and have not been returned, Shaw said.
   A third bag holding the same amount broke open, spreading the
cash in the air.
   Shaw said auditors were counting up how much was returned. Under
Canadian law, the cash belongs to Loomis and not whoever finds it.
   One cab driver was charged with theft for grabbing some of the
money.

   Jurors couldn't decide on the best English-language
novel this year, so the $50,000 prize in the Ritz Paris Hemingway
literary contest will go to charity, it was announced Thursday.
   The three nominees for this year's annual prize were the South
African writer Nadine Gordimer for ``A Sport of Nature,'' American
novelist Toni Morrison for ``Beloved,'' and ``In the Skin of a
Lion,'' by Canadian writer Michael Ondaatje.
   ``To choose the best novel of the year is always a difficult
task,'' said Pierre Salinger, the ABC News journalist who served as
jury president. ``This year, three excellent authors of great
reputation were nominated. But none of the works received a
majority of the votes from the 10 jurors.''
   The contest's rules thus call for the money to go to charity.
Half was donated to the Georges Pompidou Foundation, which helps
the elderly. The other half went to the Franco-American Volunteer
Association, which helps handicapped children get involved in
sports.
   The first Ritz Paris Hemingway award was given in 1985 to
Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa. The other winners were
Marguerite Duras of France and Peter Taylor of the United States.

<HEAD>Detroit's Black Mayor Tones Down Criticism of Jackson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Detroit Mayor Coleman Young, long at political
odds with Jesse Jackson, is striking a more conciliatory tone
toward the Democratic presidential candidate this year.
   ``I'd be a fool not to recognize the massive contribution Jesse
has made to the electoral process, and putting some color _ finally
_ in the rainbow,'' Young said. ``Obviously ... that's not enough
to win, but it's an important beginning.''
   Young still argues that Jackson's candidacy represents wasted
votes, political polarization and help for the Republicans. But he
also credits Jackson for reaching some whites with his more
mainstream Democratic candidacy this year, and expressing surprise
at his degree of support from blacks.
   Young is supporting Jackson's chief rival Michael Dukakis in
Michigan's statewide caucuses Saturday. He says his is not so much
an endorsement as a statement of whom he supports _ a distinction
Young says means the political organization that has served him for
15 years as mayor of Detroit is free to do as it wishes.
   ``Jesse has a tremendous emotional appeal to the black community
in this city,'' Young said in an interview Wednesday in his office
with several out-of-town reporters. ``I think that the chief
objective ... is to win the White House.''
   Dukakis is airing radio ads featuring Young's support, targeted
at black audiences in Detroit. He is bidding to win delegates in
the city's two largely black congressional districts, the 1st and
13th, which requires winning at least 15 percent of the vote in
those areas.
   Young maintained that he has ``truly'' released his organization
to go as it pleases and says he's not asked key supporters to
report back on whether they are siding with Dukakis, Jackson or
another candidate.
   Some politicians aren't so sure, however. State House Speaker
Gary Owen of Ypsilanti, backing Albert Gore Jr., said he understood
Young was ``coming down hard'' on his supporters to produce for
Dukakis, particularly in those key congressional districts.
   In announcing his support for Dukakis a week and a half ago,
Young said, ``Anybody who respects my opinion will do likewise.''
And Young's top political aide, Larry L. Simmons Sr., said last
week that Young would ask his staff members to inform him of their
actions in the presidential campaign.
   Young, who has seen his city's optimism decline with the fall in
federal urban aid under the Reagan administration, said a
Democratic victory in November is his paramount concern and his
reason for supporting the Massachusetts governor.
   Dukakis, he said, has the best chance to win. Jackson, he said,
``can't win.''
   Young finds fault with Jackson's lack of government experience,
but said no black candidate could be elected this year or in the
immediate future because of white resistance.
   ``I think it's rooted in race _ I don't have to look anywhere
else,'' Young said.
   Even if he should win Michigan's caucuses, Young said, Jackson
would achieve at best a plurality of the Democratic vote, not a
majority.
   ``The great majority of the black votes will follow Jesse off to
one side, whereas the great majority of the white vote will be
split among the other candidates,'' Young said. ``That is the
essense of polarization.
   ``I think the overall thrust of Jackson's campaign might very
well be to help the Republicans,'' he said.
   Young endorsed Walter Mondale in 1984 over Jackson, and he has
remained apart from Jackson this year even as some other black
leaders who were cool toward Jackson four years ago have been won
over. While there may be political risks for himself, Young said he
thinks voters' attitudes toward him won't be affected.
   ``I'm trying to preserve the unity _ I do not want to be
responsible for creating any disunity in the black community,''
Young said.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz today
called the Nicaraguan cease-fire agreement ``an important step
forward'' and said there is ``no excuse'' for any additional Soviet
bloc weapons deliveries to the Sandinista government.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reacted with cautious
optimism to the agreement while House Speaker Jim Wright hailed it
as ``a new chapter in the unhappy history of that war-torn
country.''
   Shultz urged Congress to immediately approve additional
humanitarian aid to the Contra rebels while they negotiate terms
for a definitive cease-fire with the Sandinista government.
   He said the agreement would not have been possible without years
of sacrifice by the rebels.
   ``Their strength and perseverance have created this opportunity
for peace and freedom,'' Shultz said. ``We consider this agreement
to be an important step forward.''
   Under questioning, Shultz said he feels the agreement may be a
ploy on the part of the Sandinistas to disarm the Contras. He said
that if the Sandinistas don't carry out their promises under the
agreement, the United States would have to reevaluate its policies.
   Both the White House and Wright promised to seek quick action on
a humanitarian aid package for the Contra rebels.
   ``We're glad that it occurred,'' the Fitzwater said, when asked
whether the administration was embracing the plan.
   ``There is a lot of room for encouragement here, yes, but
there's also a lot of room for skepticism, and I'm trying to
balance those two off,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We're beginning the process. We need to watch it. We've seen
processes like this start before and fail,'' he said. ``This seems
like a more concrete step, and there certainly reason to be
hopeful. But I do not want to play down the skepticism side of it
either because we are skeptical.''
   Wright said he would meet Monday with House Republicans and
representatives of the White House to begin drafting a bill to send
food, clothing, shelter and medicine to the rebels before Easter.
   Fitzwater said the White House, too, hopes an aid package can be
passed ``on a bipartisan basis'' before the recess.
   Wright said the precise form of the aid package remained to be
worked out, but that it would have to conform to the cease-fire
agreement announced Wednesday night in Sapoa, Nicaragua, after
three days of talks.
   That agreement calls for ``exclusively humanitarian aid'' to be
channeled through a neutral, international relief organization.
   Wright refused to speculate on whether there would be GOP
demands to include in the package some standby procedure for
authorizing new military aid for the rebels should the peace
process become derailed.
   Republicans, contending Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
cannot be trusted to fulfill his promises without such a threat,
have insisted on such a provision in previous debate on the issue.
   ``I think it would be counterproductive to talk about it,''
Wright told reporters. ``We don't want to rekindle the war.''
   He said he envisioned quick action on ``some minimal something
that both sides (Democrats and Republicans) can wholeheartedly
embrace.''
   ``For heaven's sake, if the Nicaraguans, who have been shooting
at each other, can agree, then surely Republicans and Democrats can
agree,'' he said.
   Wright began discussing ideas for an aid package on Wednesday in
conversations with House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., and
White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker. But he said no deals had
been made.
   ``The cease-fire talks have made it possible, by entering into
an entirely new era, to bury our hatchets in the same trenches
where they're burying their machetes in Central America,'' Wright
said.
   The aid bill likely would be similar to a $30 million package
rejected by a narrow margin on March 3, although House Majority
Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said it was unclear whether the
dollar amount would be the same.
   The rebels' last U.S. aid expired on Feb. 29.
   Earlier, interviewed on CBS television, Wright said Nicaragua is
wracked by poverty and needs to begin diverting its slender
resources to educate, feed, and clothe its people.
   ``Both sides were war-weary but were ready if they could to find
an accommodation to guarantee the integration back into their
society of these people who have been estranged from it,'' he said.
   Problems remain, Wright said, but ``there is a disposition on
both parts to enter into a more peaceful society and a more
democratic society in which freedom of the press and of expression
will be guaranteed and the rights of those who formerly made war
against that government will be fully protected.''
   ``Those of us in our Congress are anxious to do whatever we can
to encourage the fulfilment of the democratization of that
country,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Edward Feighan, D-Ohio, said three officials
from the General Accounting Office were leaving for Honduras today
to track the disposition of small arms, ammunition, jeeps and other
materials that were brought to Honduras by U.S. troops sent last
week to respond to a Sandinista incursion.
   ``My concern is that the deployment of American troops and
weapons to Honduras could in fact be another diversion of arms to
the Contras,'' said Feighan, who requested the GAO investigation.

<TEXT>
   Six members of a laboratory group who
were detained during a search for a missing frozen head have filed
false arrest claims with the county totaling $225,000.
   The six claims, filed individually at various times this month,
stem from the December beheading of 83-year-old Dora Kent so her
head could be frozen to preserve it for theoretical revival using
as-yet undiscovered medical techniques.
   The six members of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation were
detained by police Jan. 7 during a search of the premises. They
were questioned at the police department then released.
   All six say they were arrested for investigation of obstruction
of justice.
   Filing a claim is a preliminary step toward suing. Riverside
County has the option of settling the claims, or rejecting them
after they are reviewed by claims adjustors.
   In one claim, five Alcor members contend they ``suffered
emotional stress arising from the purposeful, wrongful conduct of
the coroner's investigators.'' They seek damages totaling $125,000.
The sixth person filed a separate claim for $100,000.
   During two searches at the lab, authorities found Mrs. Kent's
hands and some equipment allegedly stolen from the University of
California, Los Angeles. Her head never was found.
   Last month, the coroner's office ruled the woman's death a
homicide, finding she had been killed by a lethal dose of
barbiturates. Alcor officials contend the woman was dead when they
began their procedure.
   The case was sent to the district attorney's office, but
Prosecutor Jay Thompson Hanks said Thursday no decision regarding
charges has been made.

   West German opposition leader Hans-Jochen
Vogel today praised President Reagan's arms-control advances and
said the atmosphere had greatly improved since their last meeting
five years ago.
   Vogel, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, told reporters
after a 20-minute meeting with Reagan at the White House that he
and the president had discussed arms control, the economy and human
rights.
   ``We had a very friendly and constructive conversation with the
president,'' he said. ``I ... said, remembering five years back, we
are very impressed especially by the INF (Intermediate Nuclear
Forces) treaty, by the cooperation which developed with the Soviet
Union.''
   Vogel said he told Reagan he hoped he and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev also would be able to agree soon on reducing long-range
nuclear forces.
   He said the president ``seemed to be satisfied about the work,
what has been done in the last two or three days. They worked very
hard, they worked very (thoroughly) through the details.''
   He was referring to a visit by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, who has been meeting with Secretary of State George
Shultz and Reagan in Washington this week.
   ``Remembering my visit five years ago, it is a remarkable
change. It was a relaxed conversation. There are still some points
of different views and different opinions, but there are points
which we join and which we agree (on).''
   ``In '83 we were in the middle of the argument about the
deployment of Pershing II and there have been some other fields of
different opinions. Many of them are gone. The president making the
INF treaty and preparing START is a president more close to us than
some remarks and some positions of '81 or '82 or '83,'' Vogel said.
   The Social Democrats were part of the widespread opposition to
NAT0's deployment of the U.S. medium-range Pershing II and cruise
missiles in Europe to counter Soviet SS-20 missiles aimed at
Western Europe. The INF treaty would eliminate both the U.S. and
Soviet land-based medium-range missiles.
   Vogel said Reagan listened but didn't comment when he told him
that West German Social Democrats, like the coalition government,
oppose modernization of short-range nuclear weapons in Europe. He
said he made clear that the Social Democrats go further than the
government in urging negotiations to eliminate the weapons.
   ``I think he was not surprised,'' Vogel said.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, of the ruling Christian
Democrats, advocates a reduction in the number of the missiles but
not their elimination.
   The United States, Britain and France favor the modernization of
the short-range weapons as part of NATO's nuclear deterrent against
a Soviet bloc attack on Western Europe.

<HEAD>Anti-smoking Bill Introduced in Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill introduced in Parliament on Thursday would
allow Britons to demand to be segregated from smokers at work.
   The measure lacks the support of the Conservative government of
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and was given little chance of
passage, but it reflected a growing anti-smoking campaign.
   ``Smoking must now be treated like any other industrial heath
hazard,'' said George Foulkes of the opposition Labor Party, who
introduced the Health and Safety at Work Bill in the House of
Commons.
   He said there was ``overwhelming'' public support to ban smoking
at work except in designated areas.
   The bill would not require companies to set up non-smoking areas
in offices, but it would forbid them from firing or disciplining
any worker who refused to work alongside a smoker.
   Smokers are rarely segregated in British restaurants and other
public places, although smoking has been banned in London subways
and the number of British Rail cars where smoking is permitted has
been reduced from 25 percent to 20 percent.
   The Independent newspaper said a private survey of 1,000
companies found that almost half had either a voluntary or formal
agreement on no-smoking areas.
   In a report released Wednesday, the Independent Scientific
Committee on Smoking and Health said passive smoking, or
non-smokers' exposure to smoke, may cause several hundred lung
cancer deaths a year. It said passive smoking increases the risk of
lung cancer by 10 to 30 percent.
   In government reaction to the report, Junior Health minister
Edwina Currie said, ``The government accepts the thrust of the
report, which reflects established policies of voluntary
arrangements.''
   The state-funded Health Education Authority launched a $457,000
advertising campaign Thursday with full-page advertisements in
major newspapers urging non-smokers to stand up for their rights.
   The ads say, ``If you're a non-smoker who works with smokers,
you probably suffer in silence. Yet everybody has the right to a
healthy working environment.''

<HEAD>Two Rival Associations Fighting Over Movie Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For 58 hours after Jessica McClure tumbled
into an abandoned well, hundreds of rescuers worked together to
free her. But now they are divided over TV movie rights and have
formed two rival groups.
   Jessica, now almost 2 years old, was trapped 22 feet down an
abandoned well after she fell in Oct. 14 and rescued after teams
bored through rock to reach her. Rescuers dug a parallel shaft and
then a tunnel into the well near the spot where Jessica was stuck.
   One of the associations formed over a TV movie is committed to
producer Larry Spivey, president of Highland Communications Group
Inc. The group's 32 members, most of them rescue volunteers, have
been asking all participants to join them.
   The group, called the Jessica McClure Rescuers' Association, is
headed by Kragg Robinson, chief of Robinson Rathole Inc. of
Albuquerque, N.M.
   Robinson diverted a rathole rig from a nearby Texas Department
of Highways and Public Transportation project to dig much of the
parallel shaft.
   Robinson's mother, Yvonne, said today that no plans have yet
been announced by the group.
   ``I don't think they have accepted a proposal,'' said Mrs.
Robinson.
   The second group, the McClure Rescue Association, is comprised
of municipal workers, including Police Chief Richard Czech, Fire
Chief James Roberts and Paramedic Robert O'Donnell, who plucked the
child from the well and brought her to the surface.
   Some rescuers have decided to stay neutral.
   ``I personally don't feel that I should join any association
until a uniform group is together,'' said Bruce Peeler. ``And that
means all people involved, whether they are with the police
department, the fire department or the lady who made hamburgers at
three in the morning.''
   Peeler is president of Air Master Equipment Corp., a Midland
company that donated jackhammers and other pneumatic equipment for
the rescue.
   He and another neutral participant, Charles Boler, president of
Boler Construction of Midland, said they have attended the
volunteers' weekly meetings for about six weeks.
   Attempts to bring the two groups together have been frustrating,
they said.
   The municipal workers' group has yet to commit its rights either
but interviewed six producers and narrowed its preference down to
one, said attorney Martin Allday of Midland.
   The girl's parents, Chip and Cissy McClure, have said they are
not interested in exploiting Jessica's story for profit but did not
want to stand in the way of other plans.

<HEAD>Man Sues To Block Changes On Controversial Mosaic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of a mosaic designer has gone
to court to try to prevent the city from altering the art work's
portrayal of a smiling black man celebrating his freedom from
slavery.
   Edward A. Kane Jr. filed suit this week seeking a preliminary
injunction barring the city from changing the mosaic outside City
Hall ``because of the love I have for my father's memory,'' he said
Wednesday.
   ``I don't want to see the change made because in my opinion you
set a precedent to change paintings, books,'' Kane said. ``It
offends me. If you don't like the smile on the Mona Lisa, are you
going to change it?''
   A hearing was set for Friday in Madison County Circuit Court.
   In his lawsuit, Kane said alterations to his late father's
``work of art'' would violate constitutional rights to free speech
and artistic expression.
   The 10- by 40-foot mosaic shows white settlers in covered wagons
and a freed slave, with a broken rope hanging from his wrists,
celebrating his freedom.
   Complaints about the portrayal began in 1986. Opponents contend
it was demeaning to blacks because it does not show them making any
contribution to the city.
   In October, City Council agreed to remove the man's smile, add
other facial features and replace the ropes with a hoe. Groups
favoring the change said they would pay for alterations.
   Tim Early, chairman of the city's Human Rights Commission and a
supporter of the change, said work would begin as weather allowed.
   Early also said the mosaic, constructed in the mid-1960s, was
not the work of Edward Kane Sr. alone but had been designed by a
committee. ``I'm sure his father assisted in terms of artistic
direction. But to give him full credit is just wrong,'' Early said.

   A priest who was invited to baptize
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's seventh child says the
ceremony was delayed when 3,200 U.S. soldiers were airlifted to
Honduras.
   ``They went into a state of alert and the baptism was called
off,'' the Rev. Ray Bourgeois said here Wednesday.
   He said he had given up was preparing to leave Managua on Friday
when he got a call from Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto, a fellow
Maryknoll priest, who said the ceremony was on.
   ``We drove to the president's house. It was comfortable, but no
mansion. Kids were running around all over the place. His mother
Lydia was there, his wife, Rosario, and the godparents,'' Bourgeois
said.
   Ortega was watching the CBS Evening News via satellite.
   After some small talk, everyone moved outside to the patio where
Camila, Ortega's first daughter, was baptized.
   ``I asked him (Ortega) to share one of the readings about the
greatest commandment, to love God and your neighbor as yourself,''
Bourgeois said.
   Bourgeois, 48, said Ortega extended the invitation to Managua in
December, about a month after they met at an Organization of
American States meeting in Washington.
   He said Ortega wanted to meet him because Bourgeois had recently
been released from a prison term for trespassing on government
property during a protest against the Contra rebels.
   ``The baptism was no different from the hundreds of others I've
done,'' Bourgeois said. ``It was a family affair. A religious
event, not a political event.''

   A man arrested in the poisoning death of a
California beauty queen on a tip resulting from a TV show waived
extradition today, saying he wanted to ``get it done with.''
   During a three-minute hearing before 5th Circuit Judge Paul G.
Grant, Paul Steven Mack, 39, said he wouldn't oppose efforts to
return him to Sacramento, Calif., to face charges in the 1987
slaying.
   ``I am fully knowledgeable of the extradition proceedings and I
wish to waive it and get it done with,'' a handcuffed Mack told
Grant.
   Deputy Salt Lake County Attorney Bud Ellett said he expected
Mack, accompanied by Sacramento County sheriff's officers, to be
flown out of Salt Lake City later in the day.
   Mack, who had been working as a restaurant chef for the past
eight months under the name Sean Paul Lanier, was arrested Tuesday
near his home, said police Sgt. Bill Brusik.
   He was wanted in the slaying of Karen Grace Winslett, 21, of
Carmichael, Calif., who disappeared in February 1987, shortly after
winning the title of Miss English Leather in Las Vegas, Nev.
   Mack was arrested by police acting on a tip from a Marion, Ohio,
woman who watched Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``America's Most Wanted''
program Sunday night and recognized Mack as having once worked at a
country club where she worked.
   The woman also remembered receiving a call from a man in Salt
Lake City who wanted information about a man named Lanier, said
Sharon Telles, a spokeswoman for the Sacramento County Sheriff's
Office.
   She ``put two and two together and called authorities,'' Telles
said.
   Ohio authorities contacted Sacramento County officials, who
alerted Salt Lake City police. A check revealed that a Sean Paul
Lanier had been involved in an October 1987 traffic accident and
had produced an Ohio driver's license.
   Sacramento police contend Mack lured Winslett to his apartment
to be photographed for a possible calendar spread, then killed her
with an overdose of the painkiller Percodan, Telles said.
   Winslett's body was found in her car in the parking lot of a
North Sacramento motel 12 days after she disappeared. Detectives
said Mack was linked to the crime by physical and other evidence
that they would not detail.
   Mack also is sought for questioning by Ohio authorities in the
1981 slaying of a young woman who had worked as a secretary for him
at the Marion Country Club.
   Salt Lake City Police Detective Don Bell said records showed
Mack has used six or more aliases and has been married seven or
eight times, including a marriage last month to a Utah woman.
   Telles said police view him as a con artist who dabbled in ``all
kinds of fraud schemes.'' A convicted forger and burglar, Mack
served two prison terms and was paroled in 1985.
   Sacramento County Sheriff's Detective Bob Bell said the
``America's Most Wanted'' show generated 170 calls, most of them
involving ``look-alike'' tips about men who resembled Mack.
   The arrest was the fourth stemming from the ``Most Wanted''
show, according to Fox.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of hospitals will offer free blood
cholesterol testing May 4 in the first national screening for the
fatty substance that is a leading contributor to heart disease and
strokes.
   The program, organized by the Voluntary Hospitals of America,
was outlined Thursday at a news confrence. Officials said they were
announcing the national program well in advance to give people
plenty of time to learn where they can go for testing.
   About 400 not-for-profit hospitals that are members of the
association have agreed to participate, and organizers estimate
400,000 Americans will get the test.
   While most will do the test free, a few will charge $3.
   A public service television spot promoting the program, called
``CountDown USA,'' will begin airing next week.
   It includes a toll-free telephone number _ 800-634-9541 _ for
people to call weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (EST) to find out
which hospitals in their areas will offer the testing.
   ``We want every American adult to know his or her cholesterol
level and if it's high, do something about it,'' said Dr. DeWitt S.
Goodman, professor of medicine at the Columbia University College
of Physicians and Surgeons and a member of the staff at New York
City's Presbyterian Hospital.
   Blood cholesterol levels below 200 milligrams are associated
with a low level of coronary heart disease. Levels over 240
milligrams double the risk. Twenty percent to 25 percent of
Americans have cholesterol levels in this range, the American Heart
Association says.
   Goodman, who heads the hospital organization's screening effort,
said one valuable bit of information researchers hope to gain is
insight into which people respond. ``We really don't know who will
come to be screened,'' he said.
   Don L. Arnwine, chairman of the Voluntary Hospitals of America,
acknowledged that the estimate that 400,000 people will be tested
is little more than a guess.
   ``If 4 million show up, it may be the third or fourth day before
we can get to everyone, but we will try to serve them,'' Arnwine
said.
   The screening program was developed in association with the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to assure uniformity from
city to city.

<HEAD>North, Other Defendants Plead Innocent to Massive Fraud</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former national security aides Oliver L. North
and John M. Poindexter and two businessmen pleaded innocent
Thursday to charges they ran the Iran-Contra affair as a vast
criminal conspiracy and defrauded the government of $17 million.
   One by one, the defendants were called before U.S. District
Judge Gerhard Gesell at their arraignment, and asked by courtroom
clerk Barbara Montgomery, ``How do you wish to plead?''
   ``Not guilty,'' replied Poindexter, President Reagan's former
national security adviser; and North, a top assistant to Poindexter.
   ``Not guilty, your honor,'' responded retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim, who controlled the money
and procured the arms for the once-secret Iran-Contra operation.
   All four defendants were released on their personal recognizance
and told to report weekly by telephone to a pre-trial agency.
Although criminal defendants are often asked to surrender their
passports, Gesell said he would not impose that condition.
   Dressed in conservative business suits, the four men made their
first appearance in court since a federal grand jury, convened by
Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh 14 months ago, handed down a
23-count indictment March 16.
   North, retiring as a Marine lieutenant colonel May 1, and
Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral, embraced before the judge
entered the crowded courtroom.
   The defendants are charged with conspiring to defraud the United
States ``by deceitfully ... organizing, directing and concealing''
a program of support for the Nicaraguan Contras rebels at a time
such assistance was banned.
   The indictment also said the defendants ``knowingly did
embezzle, steal and convert to their own use'' part of the proceeds
generated by the sale of weapons to Iran.
   Although no exact figure was specified in the theft count, it
was reported elsewhere in the indictment that the arms sales
generated proceeds of some $30 million while the government was
paid only $12.2 million for the weapons.
   Gesell set no trial date but said he would hold an early hearing
to determine whether evidence gathered by Walsh is free of taint
and therefore admissible.
   All the defendants except Secord testified before Congress under
a grant of immunity from prosecution, preventing Walsh from using
any of that testimony.
   Walsh has said FBI agents assigned to his staff made sure that
he wasn't exposed to any new stories involving the hearings or
later developments. As he obtained his independent evidence, he
filed it under seal with the court. Walsh has the burden of proving
that his evidence was not tainted.
   ``The court has an independent obligation to determine ...
whether the prosecution up to this stage is or is not tainted ...''
Gesell said. ``This ought to get resolved and get resolved
quickly.''
   Gesell ordered written motions on the taint question to be filed
by April 7, and set a preliminary proceeding for April 12. A full
hearing would likely be held later in April, he said.
   Walsh pointed out he has hired retired federal judge Herbert
Stern to argue such motions, and said he was ready to move ahead.
   Gesell told the lawyers he would not allow a civil suit arising
from the Iran-Contra affair, in which Secord and Hakim are
defendants, to interfere with the criminal case. The civil trial
had been set to begin June 27.
   ``It will not go forward,'' Gesell said. ``A criminal case takes
precedence. This case has got to take priority.''
   Outside the courtroom, a crowd of demonstrators gathered to show
support for the defendants. Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, called on
President Reagan to issue ``an immediate pardon'' of North and
Poindexter.
   The defendants were met by a mob scene of reporters and
supporters as they left the courthouse.
   As Poindexter stood by silently, attorney Richard Beckler said,
``We are going to vigorously contest this case with all our
strength and might.''
   North left through a separate door and did not get close to
reporters. However, television cameramen and still photographers
mobbed his gray limousine as it drove by the building. North waved
and smiled from the car.
   Before the arraignments, some 30 supporters of the defendants
chanted as Poindexter, the last of the four to enter the building,
walked through the front door.
   ``God bless you, sir. God bless John Poindexter,'' shouted one
demonstrator.
   The group chanted, ``Fund the Contras, not the lawyers'' and
waved signs reading ``Investigate Communists in Congress'' and
``$10 Million Witch Hunt.''
   ``We're here to support Ollie North. I think he's a man of
action and a true American citizen,'' said Katie Collins of
Arcadia, Calif.
   Peter Flaherty, chairman of Citizens for Reagan, said the
demonstrators represented several organizations, including Young
Americans for Freedom, the National Defense Council and the
Coalition for America. He said they wanted to ``show friendship and
support for Ollie and solidarity with him.''

   Industrialist Armand Hammer says eight Soviet
and American medical specialists will discuss the latest treatment
for cancer during a fund-raising program to be broadcast in both
nations, Western Europe and the Middle East.
   The satellite television conference is an outgrowth of the 1986
summit conference between President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev and is part of an effort to raise $1 billion a
year for cancer research in the United States.
   Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp. and head of the
President's Cancer Panel, recently helped establish the non-profit
Stop Cancer Foundation whose goal is to raise $500 million a year
for cancer research.
   ``I know many people have said they hope to find a cure for
cancer,'' Hammer said during an interview Wednesday.
   ``But this time I believe we are truly on the verge of
conquering it. We just need more money.''
   Hammer, 89, said he believes a cure can be found within 10
years, adding, ``I hope to celebrate my 100th birthday ... knowing
I have achieved the last remaining mission in my life by ridding
the world of this scourge.''
   The two-hour teleconference on Tuesday will link cancer
specialists in Washington and Moscow. About half of the conference
will be composed of film clips of medical researchers and cancer
patients plus taped comments by Reagan, Gorbachev and other
political figures.
   The full conference will be broadcast to more than 1,250
hospitals in the United States for the benefit of doctors,
researchers and staff members.
   It also will be beamed to 43 cities in countries throughout
Europe and the Mideast by the U.S. Information Agency, and will be
broadcast in a shortened, one-hour form on Soviet television, which
reaches 150 million people.
   U.S. doctors participating in the conference will be Vincent T.
Devita Jr., director of the National Cancer Instititute; Steven A.
Rosenberg, chief of surgery for the NCI; Robert Gale, director of
the UCLA bone-marrow transplant unit, who treated victims of the
1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in the Soviet Union; and
Richard J. Steckel, director of the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer
Center at UCLA.
   Hammer said Wednesday that he and nine wealthy acquaintances
agreed to donate $100,000 each to the Stop Cancer Foundation as
``seed money.''

   Some of the leaders of violent student
demonstrations at Columbia University will gather at the campus for
a 20th anniversary reunion next month, university officials said.
   Among those expected to attend are Mark Rudd, a former leader of
the Students for Democratic Society who later became a member of
the radical Weather Underground, surrendering to police in 1978 for
his role in Chicago demonstrations in the summer of 1968. He is now
a teacher in Arizona.
   Fred Knubel, the university spokesman, said the April 22-23
reunion was not an official function, but was being organized by
the school's Episcopal chaplain, the Rev. William Starr.
   Knubel said Wednesday that the university is ``a changed place''
from the days when 700 students were arrested on campus after they
took several university officials hostage and seized some campus
buildings.
   Richard and Andrea Egan, who got married at a sit-in at one
university building, have confirmed they will attend the reunion,
he said.
   The protest was sparked by university plans to build a gym in
nearby Morningside Park and grew into a general demonstration
against the Vietnam War and government contracts for scientific
research.

   Former Mayor Lee Alexander was sentenced
to 10 years in prison today for extorting $1.5 million in kickbacks
from businessmen during his years as the city's top elected
official.
   Alexander, 60, pleaded guilty Jan. 6 to charges of racketeering,
conspiracy to obstruct a government investigation and tax evasion
in connection with what federal prosecutors called one of the
biggest public corruption cases ever uncovered in New York state.
   At his sentencing, Alexander, who once served as president of
the U.S. Conference of Mayors, also was ordered by U.S. District
Judge Thomas J. McAvoy to pay $100,000 in restitution to the City
of Syracuse in lieu of a $100,000 fine recommended by federal
prosecutors.
   ``I've brought great pain to my loved ones and the people of my
city and stand here now ready for my punishment,'' Alexander said
before sentence was pronounced.
   Alexander said his demise occurred when an effort to build a
political war chest was ``allowed to grow into a cancer.''
   Before Alexander's 10-minute speech to the judge, his attorney,
Harold Boreanaz, made an impassioned plea for leniency.
   Boreanaz rebutted statements made by prosecutors that Alexander
had not fully cooperated with the government's efforts to identify
and turn over his assets.
   Alexander would be eligible for parole after serving a third of
his sentence. U.S. Attorney Frederick Scullin said Alexander must
surrender by April 14 and would serve his sentence at a
medium-security federal prison that has yet to be determined.
   The former mayor faced nearly seven centuries in prison after
being named in a 40-count federal grand jury indictment that
accused him of 65 separate acts of extortion.
   Alexander earlier surrendered to the government more than $1.4
million in assets the government has linked with the
extortion-kickback scheme he admitted running during his four terms
as Syracuse's chief executive between 1970 and 1986.
   The former mayor was to have been sentenced on March 10 but
questions by the government about whether Alexander had withheld
any assets caused McAvoy to delay sentencing until today. Alexander
met with government attorneys for more than 20 hours and submitted
to at least two polygraph tests during the past two weeks.
   Alexander was indicted July 16, 1986, by a special grand jury
investigating public corruption in Syracuse. Alexander initially
denied the charges, but the the overwhelming and highly detailed
evidence, including testimony from Alexander's pick-up men and
other co-conspirators, caused him to seek a plea bargain.

<HEAD>Religious Activists Appeal For Ouster of Patriarch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six religious activists seeking greater religious
freedom in the Soviet Union called Thursday for a new Russian
Orthodox Church leader to replace the ailing Patriarch Pimen.
   The activists, led by the Rev. Gleb Yakunin, sent an appeal to
the 78-year-old Pimen asking that he step down because senility and
poor health make him incapable of fulfilling his duties.
   The group, who met with reporters, said they have noted some
encouraging changes in official tolerance of religion and believe
it is time for a change at the top.
   They also sent their appeal to the church Synod that meets next
week, Yakunin said, in the event Pimen does not choose to leave.
The Synod is responsible for making church appointments.
   Yakunin acknowledged that it would be unprecedented for the
church hierarchy, which is subordinate to the Communist Party
government, to oust the church leader against his will.
   ``On the shoulders of the church leader rests the heavy weight
of spiritual and historical responsibilities,'' the appeal reads.
``You, Your Supreme Holiness, are not up to bearing this weight.''
   Pimen's office recieved the appeal, church chancery director
Irina A. Tsyganova told The Associated Press.
   ``I can't say whether it will be discussed by the Synod or
not,'' she said. ``I rather doubt it as the Synod's business agenda
has been determined for a long time.''
   She said Pimen, who is widely reported to be in poor health, was
not available for comment.
   ``I doubt he will leave of his own accord,'' Yakunin said. ``But
we sent the letter with the hope that those around him who assist
him in carrying out church duties will be able to influence him.''
   Religious activist Andrei Bessmertny said Pimen rarely appears
in public and his crucial role as liaison between the Russian
Orthodox church and the government is filled by an unknown cast of
supporters.
   ``He has been seen by foreign visitors to ask his deacons where
he should go and what he should do,'' Bessmertny said. ``He has to
be led around like a very old man.''
   Yakunin and fellow priest Nikolai Gainov said they were not
appealing for any particular church official to succeed Pimen.
   Yakunin, who was imprisoned for six years because of religious
activism in the 1970s that authorities considered to be dissident
behavior, was restored to the ministry last year after 20 years of
exclusion.
   More than 200 churches have been reopened recently for the
observance of the 1,000th anniversary of the coming of Christianity
to Russia. Whether that trend will continue after the formal
observances in June is not clear, the activists said.
   Yakunin also said church activists have found it easier now to
receive religious materials from foreign affiliates, including
Bibles and magazines that once were deemed anti-Soviet.
   The appeal to Pimen also noted the positive trends, although it
criticized the dearth of monasteries, seminaries, churches and
priests.
   ``Paradoxically, it is not the church but the government that is
taking the initiative in drawing believers into the social
mainstream,'' the appeal to Pimen said. ``Society has survived a
spiritual crisis and the Russian Orthodox Church can play a
significant role in its recovery.''
   While there have been encouraging signs of change, none of the
laws instituted in 1929 to break the church's influence with the
peasantry has been repealed, Yakunin said. Those laws prohibit
charitable work by churches as well as religious education, arguing
that such work violates the principle of separation of church from
state.
   The religious activists said 54,174 churches were open at the
time of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and now there are about
7,000. The number of Russian Orthodox priests has declined on a
similar scale.

<HEAD>President Botha Accuses Church Council Of Supporting Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha issued a
stinging attack Thursday on anti-apartheid clergymen, saying they
praise guerrillas who commit horrendous atrocities.
   The accusation came in a five-page letter released by Botha in
response to a letter from the Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary
of the South African Council of Churches, who defended the clergy's
growing role in anti-government protest.
   The exchange of letters is the latest round of a bitter
church-state confrontation that began last month when the
government banned all activities by 17 major anti-apartheid
organizations. Chikane, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other
clegymen vowed to fill the void created by the bannings.
   On Feb. 29, Chikane, Tutu and 23 other church leaders were
arrested while trying to march to Parliament with a petition
protesting the crackdown.
   Chikane, in a letter to Botha a week ago, defended the
clergymen's decision to protest against ``ungodly acts of
oppression.''
   Botha, in his response, described himself as a devout Christian.
He said his government, which denies the black majority a vote in
national affairs, strove to broaden democracy and remove
discriminatory laws.
   Referring to the outlawed African National Congress and South
African Communist Party, Botha said to Chikane: ``You love and
praise the ANC-SACP, with its Marxist and atheistic ideology,
landmines, bombs and necklaces perpetrating the most horrendous
atrocities imaginable, and you embrace and participate in their
call for violence, hatred, sanctions, insurrection and revolution.
   ``In the name of God,'' added Botha, ``I call upon you to be
messengers of the true Christian religion and not of Marxism or
atheism.''
   ``Necklacing'' is a form of execution in which a gasoline-soaked
tire is placed around a victim's neck and set alight. In nationwide
unrest from 1984 through 1986, many blacks suspected of
collaborating with the government were necklaced by black militants.
   The ANC, which wages a bombing and sabotage campaign aimed at
undermining white-minority rule, repudiated necklacing last year
and the method has been used infrequently in recent months.
   At an emergency meeting Tuesday, Anglican bishops from across
South Africa pledged support for Tutu in his confrontation with
Botha. The bishops said they rejected the president's efforts to
depict the dispute as a choice between Marxism and the government's
programs.

<HEAD>Delaware Senator Leaves Hospital</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., thin and
full of good cheer, left the hospital Thursday saying ``I feel
good'' despite a setback that has delayed a second operation on an
artery in his head.
   ``I've asked you all to come today because I've decided to
announce that I am re-entering the race for president,'' the
Delaware senator joked to reporters waiting outside Walter Reed
Army Hospital where he had spent the last 11 days.
   Biden dropped out of the Democratic campaign last Sept. 23.
   He had undergone surgery to correct an aneurysm in an artery
that supplies blood to the brain on Feb. 12 and was scheduled to
have a second artery similarly repaired early in April.
   But on March 13 he re-entered the hospital for a suspected blood
clot in his leg. It turned out the clot had lodged in Biden's
lungs, where it dissipated and was absorbed by the body.
   To prevent more such clots, which occur frequently after medical
intrusion into the artery, doctors last Friday implanted a tiny,
umbrella-like filter in a large vein that conveys blood to the
right atrium of the heart. The arterial surgery now probably will
be the end of May.
   ``They don't want me working, but do want me walking,'' Biden
said. ``The most disturbing part of the intermediate step I've had
is the delay of the second operation for a month or so. The second
operation should be a relatively easy piece of cake.''
   He said he won't be back in the Senate until he recovers from
that surgery.
   Biden looked thin and said he is now down to a 34 inch waist.
   ``I probably don't look very hot, but I feel fine,'' he said.
   He declined to talk politics, saying that ``if you are out of
the loop more than a couple of days in this race, you are really
out of the loop.'' And of the race, he said: ``I think it would be
much better if I were still in it.''
   The senator wore a baseball cap with the letter ``D.'' He had
worn the same cap on his first hospital release and said he'd
gotten mail asking why he was a Detroit Tigers fan.
   ``This is a University of Delaware baseball hat,'' he said. ``I
hope this will put an end to the most serious problem I've
confronted in the last six weeks.''
   And, added the senator, who is nearly bald, ``the reason for the
hat is that they kind of took some of my hair off and I didn't have
a lot of hair to begin with.''

   Walt Disney World has handled
hazardous waste materials in a sloppy and potentially dangerous
way, the state Department of Environmental Regulation reports.
   The DER told the company it would be fined $174,399 unless it
can show that the violations are not as serious as the state agency
contends.
   ``It looks as if they (Disney supervisors) do not have good
control of their hazardous waste,'' said George Gionis, enforcement
section manager for DER's Central Florida district.
   A two-day inspection of the 43-square-mile tourist attraction in
January found nine violations, seven classified as major. The DER
wants the company to test for possible groundwater contamination in
two of the nine areas inspected.
   Disney spokesman John Dreyer said Thursday the company had
``always tried to comply with DER regulations, and we will make
whatever improvements are deemed necessary.''
   The inspection was conducted after the DER received an anonymous
complaint.
   Much of the criticism involved a maintenance yard in the Epcot
Center section, where toxic paints, solvents, pesticides and other
chemicals are stored.
   The DER described the maintenance yard as an ``uncontrolled,
unsupervised, unmanaged and unposted site.''
   State inspectors said they found steel drums stored
indiscriminately and filled with waste and unknown chemicals. Many
drums were unlabeled, rusty, open or lying on their sides, with
their contents running off a concrete slab where they could
contaminate groundwater.
   There were no precautions to guard against fires, explosions or
spills, the inspectors said.
   Such dangers, plus a possible contamination of groundwater,
``could threaten human health or the environment,'' according to
the report.
   Inspectors found only one employee that had received training in
handling the materials, and the DER asked that Disney set up a
training course on hazardous-waste management.
   The park passed similar inspections in 1984 and 1985. No
inspections were made in 1986 or 1987. In 1981 and 1983, it was
cited for minor violations.
   Disney officials have 10 days to meet with the regulatory agency
to set up a plan for correcting violations and negotiate penalties.
It could take months or even years to make some of the changes
requested, Gionis said.

   Fire officials on Thursday investigated a blaze at
an abandoned house used by crack cocaine addicts, the fifth such
fire which officials said may be the work of anti-drug vigilantes.
   ``I don't have a gut feeling whether it's the same person,''
said fire Lt. John Gilbert. ``It could be one person or four
different people. I do know that whoever it is is not serving the
community.''
   As in the other cases, police found little evidence to aid their
investigation of the fire which broke out Tuesday in a
working-class neighborhood, according to fire spokeswoman Cristy
Hickman.
   Investigators believe the blaze may be related to fires that
gutted three houses March 17 and another house two weeks ago near
Coral Gables, a suburb of Miami, Ms. Hickman said Thursday.
   One firefighter suffered a heart attack during one of the fires
last week and is still hospitalized, she said. Six other
firefighters and one civilian have also sustained minor injuries.
   The latest fire was confined to a small area of a vacant
two-story house and appeared to involve a flammable liquid. No
injuries were reported.
   Although not in the same neighborhoods, the fires have all
involved vacant buildings that were hangouts for vagrants and crack
users, and all involved a flammable liquid, fire officials said.
   ``People seem to know where they are,'' Gilbert said of the
crack houses. ``Police know where they are, too. They try their
best but as soon as they close someone down, someone else moves
in.''
   Gilbert is concerned that more people could get hurt, or even
killed, and that copycats may prompt more fires, especially since
avenging arsonists are gaining prominence around the country.
   Two men who recently set fire to a crack house in their Detroit
neighborhood were featured on three national news magazines and a
national morning television show.
   ``I resent all this attention they're getting,'' said Lt. Jon
Bozich of the Detroit Fire Department. ``The more you make heroes
out of these guys the more problems we're going to have. Everybody
wants to be a hero.''

<TEXT>
   Representatives of the recreation and small
aircraft industries and other insurance users claimed Thursday that
insurance costs have skyrocketed in the past four years because of
problems with the legal system, not because of insurance company
conspiracy.
   The groups stopped short of directly criticizing lawsuits filed
Tuesday by eight states that accused dozens of insurance companies
of conspiring to curtail insurance coverage. Instead, the groups
told reporters that the suits, filed in federal court in San
Francisco, served to draw attention from what they believe is the
main problem: high damage awards by the courts and frivolous suits.
   ``We would love to find a simple solution to this,'' said
Derrick Crandall, president of the American Recreation Coalition.
``Unfortunately, having lived with this crisis for the last four
years, we've concluded there are many factors involved.
   ``We don't believe this is an issue of insurance companies
colluding,'' Crandall continued. ``If that were the case, why can't
some recreation companies find insurance at any cost?''
   Edward W. Stimpson, president of the General Aviation
Manufacturers Association, echoed Crandall's contentions.
   ``Many of our companies are now self-insured or self-insured for
the first $50 million or $100 million,'' Stimpson said. ``So, our
problem is not an insurance problem, but what's going on in our
courthouses and legal system.''
   He presented figures showing that the number of fatal accidents
involving small planes decreasing in the past decade, while the
amount of paid claims rose significantly.
   William Kronenberg, president and chief executive officer of
Environmental Compliance Services Inc., which manages insurance
programs for companies involved in storing, cleaning up and
disposing hazardous wastes, agreed that the court system is to
blame.
   Kronenberg said ``It is clear that many of the insurance
companies did not have an adequate understanding of the pollution
industry'' when they originally wrote policies and then sharply
increased rates or stopped writing insurance when they realized
their risks.
   Blair Childs, executive director of the American Tort Reform
Association, which says it represents more than 400 trade
associations, businesses and professional groups, said his group
has been pushing for several pieces of legislation at the state
level, among them one that would give judges more power to impose
sanctions on lawyers who bring frivolous lawsuits.

   The White House said today that the upcoming
summit between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev will be ``quite productive'' even though the two sides
are separated by a wide range of major differences.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied that Reagan had
scheduled his fourth summit with the Soviet leader merely as a
wrap-up to the president's second term.
   The May 29-June 2 Moscow summit ``will be well prepared; there
will be substance to discuss; there will be good prospects for
success,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   He added that ``there will be a number of important and
substantive and meaningful issues to be resolved and all of those
things will occur at the Moscow summit. It meets all the criteria
that needs to be met.''
   If U.S. and Soviet negotiators can unravel disagreements over
the next nine weeks, Reagan and Gorbachev will sign a sweeping pact
to cut long-range nuclear weapons arsenals.
   ``I think this summit will be quite productive, well defined,
well prepared,'' the spokesman said without citing any specific
areas of agreement.
   Fitzwater was queried about summit prospects amid indications
from both Secretary of States George Shultz and Soviet foreign
minister Eduard Shevardnadze on Wednesday that little agreement was
found on an array of troublesome issues.
   Prior to Reagan's first summit sessions with the Soviet leader,
the White House had repeatedly insisted Reagan would not meet with
Gorbachev unless substantive progress on matters such as arms
control could be achieved.
   Fitzwater said the success of the Shultz-Shevardnadze sessions
this week lies in the fact that both sides had ``faced all the
tough problems'' and that there is no confusion about where both
sides stand.
   ``We made enough progress to keep going and presumably we will
make more in the days ahead,'' the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater also announced that Reagan had accepted an invitation
from the Finnish government to travel to Helsinki from May 26 to
May 29, prior to the summit. Afterward, he will stop in London on
the way home.
   The president will deliver an address while in Helsinki and
might deliver another in London, the spokesman said, but he gave no
other details.
   Shultz, in a meeting with reporters Wednesday evening, was asked
about chances for reaching an arms control agreement in time for it
to be signed at the summit.
   ``I wouldn't want to lay you odds,'' he responded.
   The road to the summit is also littered with divisions on
Central America, the Middle East, and above all, Afghanistan, where
plans by the Soviets to end their 8-year intervention have hit a
snag.
   Reagan has been talking about going to the Soviet Union since
the autumn of 1985 when he and Gorbachev were in Geneva for their
first meeting. Not since President Nixon visited Moscow in 1974 and
President Ford went to Vladivostok later that year has an American
chief of state traveled to the land Reagan once called ``an evil
empire.''
   The summit's proposed highlight would be the signing of a treaty
to scrap 30 percent to 50 percent of the superpowers' long-range
bombers, missiles and submarines. But major differences remain,
despite pronouncements that progress was made during Shevardnadze's
three days of talks in Washington.
   Asked if a treaty would be ready in time, Reagan said, ``I have
no way of answering that.'' Shevardnadze called it ``a
possibility.''
   The envisioned treaty would set a ceiling of 6,000 warheads on
long-range missiles and bombers, but the two sides must still set
sub-limits on the various types of weapons and decide how to verify
compliance with a pact.
   The compliance issue is especially thorny because the weapons
are among the hardest to detect in the superpower arsenals:
sea-launched cruise missiles, ballistic missiles on submarines and
cruise missiles launched from bombers.
   Shevardnadze said progress has been made on verification, but
``much more work needs to be done,'' at the continuing round of
talks in Geneva and at two more Shultz-Shevardnadze sessions, first
in Moscow April 21-25 and then in the middle of May at an
unspecified site.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze portrayed their governments as working
with a common purpose to fit pieces of the arms control puzzle in
time for the summit. They made no effort to hide their sharp
disagreements over regional issues like Afghanistan.
   The Soviets rejected Shultz's proposal for a freeze in supply of
military aid to the Afghan government during a withdrawal of the
Soviet Union's 115,000 troops and for three months afterward. The
United States would stop aiding the Afghan resistance during the
same period.
   Shevardnadze adamantly rejected the offer, telling reporters the
Soviet backing for the Afghan government was codified in a treaty
and ``we are not going to rescind that treaty.''
   The Soviet Union has pledged to withdraw the troops, which went
into Afghanistan in December 1979, but lack of agreement on aid
cutoffs has complicated the process.
   Shultz said the Soviets were willing to withdraw forces by the
end of the year, beginning with a 50 percent pullout during the
first three months. But unless the Soviets stop aiding the Marxist
government at the same time as it withdraws, Afghanistan will
remain unstable, he said.
   The two foreign ministers also apparently hit a dead end in
talks about Central America.
   The United States wants the Soviet Union to stop supplying
weapons to Nicaragua, but Shevardnadze wants the United States to
stop doing the same for other Central American nations before the
Soviets will stop helping Nicaragua, Shultz said.

   Orchestra conductors don't expect to have
weekends off, but James Conlon faces a Saturday that's close to
ridiculous.
   In the afternoon, he will conduct Mussorgsky's ``Khovanshchina''
at the Metropolitan Opera and in the evening he'll be next door in
Avery Fisher Hall conducting the New York Philharmonic in an
all-Mahler program.
   He knew about the double workshift about a year ago, Conlon said
Thursday. ``I thought, `I can do that.'''
   He'll be free between 5:30 and 8 p.m., Conlon said. ``I'll go
home, shower, dress again, sit quietly for an hour and a half.'' He
says he won't even need a snack between performances.
   ``It is actually less exhausting to do this than to rehearse all
day,'' said Conlon, 38. ``Rehearsals are very intense. They take a
lot out of you.
   ``Concerts wind you up and give you energy. I find, after a
concert or particularly after an opera, physically you can be
extremely stimulated, for several hours to come.''

   Scientists have used lasers to identify
organic chemicals in meteorites, and say the new technique may
revolutionize analysis of certain pollutants, oil-bearing rocks and
other chemicals.
   The procedure is much faster than standard chemical tests,
requires only a tiny sample and doesn't destroy the material, said
a statement by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
   The technique was developed by chemist Richard N. Zare and
colleagues at Stanford University.
   Its use to identify organic compounds in six meteorites was
outlined in a study, published in Friday's issue of the journal
Science, by Zare and his colleagues at Stanford and by Jeffrey L.
Bada, a marine chemist at Scripps, which is part of the University
of California, San Diego, located in La Jolla.
   ``The problem with standard chemical techniques for doing
organic analyses of meteorites and other rare materials is that
they are laborious, destroy the sample and require one to 10 grams
of the material to be tested,'' Bada said.
   A gram is about one-30th of an ounce.
   ``Our method can reduce the analysis time from a month or more
to just a few minutes, and we need only one millionth of a gram to
do the test,'' he said. ``In addition, the technique does not
require the use of solvents that can contaminate the sample, and is
non-destructive to the sample.''
   The new method may be used widely to analyze meteorites, cosmic
dust, environmental pollutants and oil-bearing sediments, the
Scripps statement said, adding that the technique ``may
revolutionize the way certain chemical compounds are analyzed.''
   The study found wide variation in the content and relative
amounts of organic substances known as polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, or PAHs, in the meteorites that were tested.
   Scientists believe meteorites are remnants of the young solar
system, and analyzing their contents may provide clues as to why
life arose on Earth but not elsewhere in the solar system.
   The researchers placed tiny amounts of meteorite samples on a
Teflon-coated probe, then inserted the probe into a vacuum chamber.
Each sample was hit with a 10-millionth-of-a-second burst from a
carbon dioxide laser, which heated the samples to about 1,000
degrees Fahrenheit.
   The heat released molecules of the samples into the vacuum
chamber, where they then were struck by an ultraviolet laser beam.
That electrically charged the organic compunds in the meteorites so
the chemicals could be separated and identified by matching their
masses with masses of known substances.

   A supertanker put out a distress signal
in the southern Persian Gulf today and appeared to be the victim of
an Iranian attack, but the captain denied it had been hit, maritime
salvage executives said.
   The executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
267,589-ton Friendship L reported in a radio contact that its
engine room was on fire. The captain did not say what caused the
fire.
   In a later contact, the captain denied his vessel had been the
target of an Iranian raid. The Iranians have launched nine attacks
on neutral shipping in the southern gulf since Friday.
   The ship attacks are part of the so-called tanker war, an
offshoot of the 7{-year-old Iraq-Iran conflict. About 500 ships
have been attacked by both sides, according to the London-basec
Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit, which monitors worldwide
navigation.
   Salvage tugboats rushed to the Friendship L, which gave its
location between the southern gulf emirates of Ajman and Ras
al-Khaimah, close to the Strait of Hormuz, said the executives. The
strait is the sole entry to the gulf. There was no immediate word
on the extent of damage.
   The executives said the vessel in distress was in almost the
same area where a Cypriot freighter, the Odysseas H, was attacked
by two Iranian gunboats on Wednesday. Eight other attacks on
freighters and tankers of different nationalities were hit by the
Iranians in the past week, all in the same vicinity.
   Salvage tugboats were still struggling to contain a blaze in the
crew quarters of the Odysseas H, 24 hours after the attack. No
casualties were reported on board.
   Strong winds were whipping up the flames and impeding the
salvage operation, the executives said. Reports indicated the
vessel was being steered in the direction of Omani waters for
shelter where the salvage operation would be completed.

   The Du Pont Co. plans to end production of
chlorofluorocarbon compounds, the most potent destroyers of the
earth's ozone shield, the company said today.
   But the company's chairman, in a letter to several senators, did
not say when the production would cease.
   Du Pont Chairman Richard E. Heckert told Sen. Robert Stafford,
R-Vt., that the company decided on ``an orderly transition to the
total phaseout'' of the compounds following a report last week that
they probably were responsible for a 2.3 percent decline in the
thickness of the earth's ozone shield from 1969 to 1986.
   The ozone shield, generally 15 to 25 miles high, blocks harmful
ultraviolet rays from the sun that can cause skin cancer.
   The compounds are used for refrigeration fluids, plastic foam
blowing agents and cleaning solvents, and aerosol propellants
outside the United States.
   The United States ended aerosol use in 1978, which caused
worldwide production to dip, but production resumed its upward
climb in the early 1980s.
   In 1985, the nations of the world produced 2.28 billion pounds,
about 30 percent in the United States.
   The report, by a panel of scientists assembled by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, constitutes ``important new
information'' justifying Du Pont's reversal of its previous
position that an end to CFC production was not justified, Heckert
said.
   The letter was made available by Stafford's office. Similar
letters were given to Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont., and David
Durenberger, R-Minn.
   ``It's a very responsible move. Du Pont must now press their
industry colleagues'' for similar action, Baucus said in a
statement.
   The three senators challenged Du Pont on Feb. 22 to live up to
the company's mid-1970s pledge that it would end production of CFC
compounds if a threat to health were demonstrated. Heckert wrote
back on March 4 repeating the pledge but adding, ``At the moment,
scientific evidence does not point to the need for dramatic CFC
emission reductions.''
   Today's letter said Du Pont was encouraging other producers to
``join us in pursuit of this goal,'' and would ``urge all nations
to treat this new scientific information seriously.''

<TEXT>
   The United States moved 250 more military
police into Panama this week, more than doubling the number of
security personnal assigned to the strife-torn country since March
14, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the latest deployments
brought to 670 the total of extra security personnel airlifted to
Panama, ``and that's it.''
   ``At least, that's it for the interim,'' Howard said. ``This was
part of a general, supplemental deployment of military policemen,
and that supplemental deployment has now come to an end. So I don't
expect it to go any higher.''
   The U.S. Southern Command, which is headquartered in Panama, had
about 600 security personnel assigned to it before the United
States stepped up its campaign earlier this month to oust strongman
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. The new deployments thus more than
double the number of security personnel in the country.
   Howard, asked why the Pentagon thought it needed to airlift
additional personnel when there were already 10,000 U.S. servicemen
in the country, said the concern was having sufficient ``people who
are trained as military policemen. ... They're trained to handle
riot control and all sorts of things. And this has to do with the
physical security of our military installations, housing areas and
the like due to civil unrest and potential for civil unrest in the
country.''
   Capt. Nancy LaLuntas, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said Thursday the
latest group of approximately 250 MPs had been drawn from the 503rd
Military Police Battalion at Fort Bragg, N.C.
   Earlier this week, the Pentagon announced it had dispatched
about 212 soldiers from that unit to Panama, at the time bringing
the ``security augmentation'' to 420.
   Although no moves have been reported against American servicemen
or their dependents, defense officials are said to be concerned
that Noriega might lash back at the United States by attacking or
sabotaging facilities there.

   The prosecution rested its case today in
the second of three impeachment allegations against Gov. Evan
Mecham being tried before the Arizona Senate.
   After the prosecution called its last witness, presiding officer
Frank X. Gordon Jr. denied a defense motion to dismiss the charge
that Mecham misused $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by
loaning it to his auto dealership.
   The defense called as its first witness Roger Hagadorn, a Valley
National Bank vice president who said he had loaned money to
members of the Mecham family for decades and none had ever
defaulted.
   Earlier today, Sen. Tony West said the allegation that Mecham
loaned public money to his auto dealership is serious and could
have been the subject of a criminal investigation.
   West spoke as former state Attorney General Jack LaSota
testified that he believed the $80,000 loan from the governor's
protocol fund was illegal.
   ``Your testimony, if accurate, is either a nuclear explosion or
at least devastating,'' West said.
   A criminal charge that Mecham misused public money would be a
class 4 felony carrying a penalty of up to $150,000 and five years
in prison, the senator said.
   Jeffrey Colville, a developer and mortgage banker, testified
today that there were three previous liens totaling $3.7 million on
the Mecham Pontiac property, in addition to the deed of trust for
the $80,000 loan.
   The property was appraised at $3.35 million a year earlier,
Colville ssid. In the event of a foreclosure, the previous liens
would have to be paid off before the $80,000 loan could be repaid,
he said.
   However, defense lawyer Jerris Leonard questioned whether the
appraisal was low as part of a general industry practice.
   Asked by prosecutor Paul Eckstein if he would have made the
$80,000 loan to Mecham Pontiac based on that information, Colville
said, ``I would have to answer no.''
   The prosecution has contended the auto dealership needed the
money badly, and that the $80,000 loan was not simply a business
deal intended to benefit the protocol fund as the defense said.
   LaSota, who was attorney general under the Republican governor's
predecessor, Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt, testified Wednesday
that the loan violated several state laws.
   Earlier, an accountant who examined the records of the
dealership said it would have been overdrawn at its bank had Mecham
not borrowed the $80,000 on July 17, also contradicting the
governor's previous testimony.
   ``Unless these funds had been paid from the protocol fund,
Mecham Pontiac would have had an overdraft the following Wednesday
in excess of $60,000,'' said accountant Randall Sorensen.
   Mecham's lawyers contend the protocol fund, created with
fund-raising proceeds from the governor's inauguration, is private
money and the loan was merely a good business deal intended to
provide a higher interest rate to the fund.
   The prosecution, however, says the protocol fund is state money
since it is intended for the purchase of ceremonial state gifts and
other means of promoting Arizona's image.
   In January, Mecham testified before a House impeachment
committee that his dealership did not need the money to pay its
bills.
   However, Sorensen said his analysis of the dealership's records
showed that it paid First Interstate Bank $81,309 owed for six cars
on the day it received the $80,000 from the protocol fund.
   Defense attorney Jerris Leonard suggested the dealership could
have had other assets which could have been converted to cash, but
Sorsensen said he had found no such assets.
   LaSota testified that he had examined the way the protocol fund
was set up and the applicable state laws and concluded it was
public money, even though it was not officially turned over to the
state treasury.
   The $80,000 loan violated state laws against loaning state
money, failing to keep the fund intact until it was properly
disbursed and transferring money when not authorized by law, LaSota
said.
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six decades,
also has been charged with obstructing the investigation of an
alleged threat and concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   The first-term governor also faces an April 21 criminal trial on
felony charges of concealing the campaign loan and a May 17 recall
election.
   A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required to convict
Mecham in the impeachment trial.

   The winds of change are shifting fast in French
fashion.
   Having barely coaxed women into knee-baring minis, several
important designers did an about-face to long skirts in winter
ready-to-wear collections.
   The different lengths shown over eight days give a wealth of
options to women who choose to bare or hide their legs.
   Influential creators such as Yves Saint Laurent, Valentino,
Christian Lacroix are among those whose fashions still are above
the knee.
   But saying he's tired of minis, Karl Lagerfeld showed some
nearly ankle-length skirts in his own collection. His skirts for
Chanel were both short and long.
   Yohji Yamamoto's somber looks were all long. But many others,
including Rykiel, Kenzo and Ungaro, offered optional lengths.
   Trousers are back in a very big way, another boon to women who
have never given them up for city wear, no matter what Paris has
decreed lately.
   Claude Montana featured nearly all slim pants, and only a few
ankle-length skirts, in his sharp collection. The ``clothes
sculptor'' outlined his handsome jackets with enormous funnels or
big collars turned down to eclipse the shoulder, the waist looking
tiny over trumpet-shaped jacket hems.
   Other pants ranged from gray flannel and straight with pleats
from the waist, as at Scherrer, Saint Laurent and Cerruti. At
Chanel they appeared full, as ``pant-skirts.'' At Ungaro they were
slightly draped.
   Besides these developments, there's a big range of silhouettes,
although a note of sobriety has crept in. In a competitive market
characterized by a shaky and lower dollar, designers are aiming to
sell to a more cautious consumer who is looking for wearability
rather than gags in their clothes.
   Overpadded shoulders are out. Belted or boxy coats were topped
with big bertha collars or wraps, which were handsome in dazzling
colors at Lacroix. Ankle or knee-length princess or redingote
styles swept down the runways, as did tent-like greatcoats, plus
capes and caped shoulders.
   Suits came back in force, silhouettes lean and sophisticated, or
full-skirted for ingenues. Jacket options were often fine for
adventurous businesswomen who like to dress with style, in
everything from lively boleros to sharply pointed spencers. Saint
Laurent's stunning classics were fronted with geometric or cubist
patchwork effects.
   Christian Lacroix topped his high-waisted checked suit with a
cropped V-neck bolero. Lagerfeld opted for very long jackets for
his own and the Chanel collection, along with good short jackets at
the latter. Another easy topper is a wrapped surplice blouse or
sweater.
   Shawl collars, shoulder wraps and fur-trimmed lapels were
frequent favorite details on suits or coats.
   The new quiet looks featured plenty of easy lines in jersey.
There were belted bicolored tunic outfits at Saint Laurent, layers
of flowing A-line jerseys at Issey Miyake. Even fashion's former
``bad boy'' Gaultier went into easily fluid clothes, leaving behind
his weird padded corset-looks.
   Ungaro varied his complicated, waist-cinched puff-sleeved looks
with a big line of flowered babydoll flyaway dresses in light
fabrics, which should please the full-figured woman. He also
brought back the chemise, shaped mainly by a low knotted drape in
back.
   Daytime fabrics featured bright windowpane plaids, gray or black
and white checks, chevrons, tweeds and pinstripes. Dressier were
the flowered light wool fabrics at Lanvin and Ungaro. Paisleys
looked lovely in the new suits, as did tapestries or oriental-rug
motifs at Lacroix.
   The fabrics bonanza also included smooth or stretch lycra
jersey, cashmere, cable-knits, mohair, broadcloth or serge, lots of
suede or lambskin, and curly Mongolian lamb for warm-looking coats.
   Daytime colors abounded in browns from beige to chocolate, all
shades of gray, plus grayish pastels. Autumnal notes of burgundy,
plum, grape, siena and ochre contrasted with the luminous colors:
flame red, royal blue, emerald, tangerine and lemon.
   For evenings, there were sexy styles, although simpler clothes
were offered along with the fancy.
   Body-hugging little black suits and dresses were dolled up in
all sorts of ways: chandelier crystals at Saint Laurent, billiard
balls, silver nails or pearly hearts at Patrick Kelly; sequins,
lace, bows and rhinestones nearly everywhere.
   The Lacroix influence in puffs, bubbles and strapless
bustier-topped mini dance dresses is still on the party circuit.
Flounced taffeta or faille gowns, knee-baring in front with trains
in the back are adding gala touches at Laroche and Saint Laurent.
   Besides ubiquitous black, the opulent late-day clothes came out
in zingy shades of yellow, amethyst, green and fuschia taffeta and
faille. Lots of black velvet and guipure or heavy lace starred as
well, along with some shimmery flower prints.
   Less elaborate evening choices were some strikingly simple
at-home or dinner outfits. They were great at Chanel in a
drape-fronted ivory crepe number topped by a long cable-knit
cardigan and pearls. Also elegant were Lagerfeld's velvet and satin
``Medieval'' gowns with very high waists to emphasize the decollete.

<HEAD>Dispute Flares Over Postal Cuts, Operations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress and the Reagan administration clashed
Thursday over who is at fault for recent cuts in postal services
and what future would be best for the embattled mail system.
   Federal budget director James C. Miller III and members of the
House Post Office and Civil Service Committee sought to place blame
for the postal cutbacks on one another _ with both sides calling
the accounting process ``smoke and mirrors.''
   The Postal Service curtailed some window hours and halted Sunday
collections and some sorting after the federal budget
reconciliation bill required it to reduce spending without
increasing revenues.
   Postage rate hikes slated for April 3, boosting a first-class
stamp price to a quarter, are unrelated to the dispute.
   In addition to finding fault with one another for the agency's
budget crisis, disagreements flared over proposals by Miller and
others to ``privatize'' the Postal Service by making it a private
firm and opening mail delivery to business competition.
   Miller said that plan would cut costs, imoprove efficiency and
probably result in better service and lower costs for consumers.
   But Moe Biller, head of the American Postal Workers Union, told
the House subcommittee on postal operations that, in his opinion,
all Miller wants is to destroy the Postal Service.
   Privatization is only political jargon for ``profitization,''
Biller said, terming the idea ``the tale of an idiot, full of sound
and fury, signifying nothing.''
   Rep. Frank Horton, R-N.Y., said he believes that instead of
improving service, turning postal services over to private hands
could well destroy the service.
   The prime bone of contention, however, was delegating blame for
the federal budget process last December that ended with the Postal
Service being directed to cut spending as part of overall
reductions in the federal budget.
   The Office of Management and Budget is not seeking to manage the
Postal Service and did not impose the cuts, Miller told the
congressmen. He said that the decision was made by members of
Congress themselves.
   Miller said he only agreed that the cuts would reduce the
federal deficit, because the Postal Service is counted in the
federal budget. ``I did not advocate it,'' he said.
   ``Who did?'' asked Horton, contending that the ``heavy hand'' of
the budget office was felt at the session where decisions were
made, because that office refused to approve other proposals that
had been made instead of the postal cuts.
   Horton and Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, both said they are now
supporting a bill to take the Postal Service out of the federal
budget so it would not become involved in this type of problem in
the future. The Postal Service, an independent federal agency, was
not counted in the overall federal budget until 1985.
   ``I think the Postal Service should be placed off budget,''
Miller, who has long opposed the idea, told a momentarily stunned
audience. Then, he added: ``By making it part of the private
sector.''
   ``You take a very crass and insensitive approach to things,''
Leland said, stating that he is concerned that privatization would
lead to a loss of federal jobs and to the opportunities for
minorities that the post office has long provided.
   ``Why do you think that would end if it were transferred to the
private sector?'' Miller asked.
   Leland shot back, ``You want to break it up and sell it off and
those people who are buying do not necessarily believe in
affirmative action. Your administration does not believe in
affirmative action.''

<HEAD>Breast Cancer Cure Rate Linked To Menstrual Cycle In Mice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Women may have a better chance of
being cured of breast cancer by surgery if they undergo the
operation at the right time in their menstrual cycle, a study of
mice suggests.
   Even post-menopausal women, who get the most breast cancers,
might be helped if such an effect is found and studied in humans,
said researcher William Hrushesky of the University of Minnesota.
   If scientists could tailor a woman's treatment to reproduce
factors responsible for higher cure rates, ``we could do that in
any woman, whether she was pre- or post-menopausal,'' Hrushesky
said.
   Breast cancer will appear in 135,000 American women this year
and kill 42,000. Surgery can remove the tumor, but cancer cells
that escaped before surgery can cause recurrence elsewhere in the
body.
   Hrushesky described the mouse experiment Wednesday at a science
writers seminar sponsored by the American Cancer Society. The work
focused on the 5{-day mouse estrous cycle, which corresponds to the
monthly menstrual cycle in women.
   Tumors that grow faster in response to the hormone estrogen, as
many human breast tumors do, were implanted in the mice. Later
analysis showed the timing of the implant in the estrous cycle made
no difference in cure rates.
   But the timing of surgery to remove the tumors markedly
influenced the likelihood that cancer would have spread to the
lungs by 28 days after the operation, Hrushesky said.
   Sixteen of 60 mice that underwent surgery near the fertility
peak of the cycle were found to be free of lung involvement,
compared with nine of 73 that had surgery during the infertile
phase.
   That translates to 27 percent versus 12.3 percent. Under a
different method to determine estrous stage, the percentages came
to 31.3 percent and 14.9 percent.
   In human terms, the higher cure rate corresponds to surgery just
before and during ovulation, with the lower rate corresponding to
surgery around menstruation, Hrushesky said.
   In the mice, fluctuation in the cure rate mirrored changes in
activity levels of ``splenocyte natural killer'' cells, which
attack cancer cells that have spread from tumors, he said. But that
does not prove the cells play a role in the findings, he said.
   Hrushesky said he had no detailed explanation for the results.
The trauma of surgery may affect the balance between cancer and the
disease-fighting immune system differently at different times in
the estrous cycle, he said.
   He emphasized the results do not imply that cancer cells are
spread from the tumor by surgery.
   The next step is studying hospital records for evidence of any
protective pattern in past surgeries, and following the progress of
women after they have breast cancer surgery at known points in the
menstrual cycle, he said.
   ``Within a few years we may know if this is true in human
beings,'' he said.
   ``It certainly deserves study. I think it will get it,'' said
Benjamin Byrd Jr., clinical professor of surgery at Vanderbilt
University Medical School.
   Byrd said the evidence so far does not convince him that the
stress of surgery plays a role, but that hormone levels may.
   ``This is a whole new look'' at appraising or altering immune
sytem response to cancer, said Byrd, a past president of the cancer
society.
   Hrushesky also said a chemotherapy schedule tailored to the
natural day-long rhythms of the body prolonged survival in 50
people with cancer that had spread from the kidney.
   Patients received a continuous drug infusion with the dose
peaking every night. That let them tolerate twice as much drug per
week than if the dose level were fixed, Hrushesky said.

   The former Armed Forces Radio disc
jockey portrayed by Robin Williams in the hit movie ``Good Morning,
Vietnam'' says Hollywood distorted his original idea for a
screenplay and his life.
   ``No, I did not try to meet girls on street corners. No, I did
not teach American slang to the Vietnamese. No, I was not thrown
out of Vietnam and to my knowledge, no Vietnamese friends of mine
were Viet Cong,'' Adrian Cronauer told students Wednesday at
Mississippi State University.
   But he praised Williams' performance, which has been nominated
for an Academy Award.
   Cronauer, 49, a law student at the University of Pennslyvania,
bellowed ``Goooood Mooooorning, Vietnam'' at the beginning of his
popular ``Dawn Buster'' 1965 Saigon radio show.
   His trademark sign-on was adopted by succeeding Saigon DJs,
including ``Wheel Of Fortune'' host Pat Sajak.

   Families should avoid measuring
themselves against their television counterparts, who generally are
beautiful people in dazzling situation far removed from reality,
actress Meredith Baxter-Birney says.
   ``You'll never come out on top,'' said Ms. Baxter-Birney, who
plays Elyse Keaton on NBC's ``Family Ties.''
   The lifestyles portrayed on TV are so ``outside the realm of the
average person that inevitably unconscious comparisons are made,''
she told Wilson College students Wednesday.
   ``Maybe kids would like their own families better if they
weren't comparing them to the ones on TV,'' she said.
   ``I guess our obligation is to be alert to the messages being
sent _ educate our children and ourselves and not measure
ourselves'' against television, said Ms. Baxter-Birney, one of
several people speaking at Wilson this year as part of a discussion
on values in American society.

   Ryan, 16, and his mother, Jeanne White, will visit Father
Flannigan's Boys Town on Friday in Omaha before speaking at a forum

   In Council Bluffs, Ryan will visit a children's home.
   Ryan's efforts to attend school even though he carries the AIDS
virus divided the community of Kokomo.
   In spite of national health officials' assurances, school
officials and worried parents weren't convinced that other children
would be safe sitting next to Ryan, who contracted AIDS through
infected treatments for hemophilia.
   The fight eventually drove Ryan and his family from Kokomo to

   David A. Stockman, the former White House budget

smaller rival Blackstone Group, it was announced Thursday.
   Stockman, 41, a managing director at Salomon since leaving the
White House in 1985, will handle all merchant banking activities
and merger transactions for the Blackstone Group, the company said.
   ``My experience at Salomon was absolutely agreeable,'' Stockman
said. ``There's one thing I couldn't do there, which is have my own

   His departure from Salomon comes against a background of turmoil
within the venerable investment firm, a partial result of the
uncertain outlook for Wall Street in the aftermath of the stock
market crash five months ago.
   Several other high-ranking executives also have quit Salomon
recently.

<TEXT>
   A man arrested after police followed a tip
generated by a television show was extradited Thursday to
California to face charges in the poisoning death of a beauty queen.
   During a three-minute hearing Thursday, Paul Steven Mack, 39,
told 5th Circuit Judge Paul G. Grant he wouldn't fight efforts to
return him to Sacramento, where he is charged in a felony homicide
warrant in the 1987 slaying of Karen Grace Winslett.
   Sacramento County Sheriff's Department spokewoman Sharon Telles
said Mack was expected in Sacramento later Thursday.
   Mack, who had been working as a chef for eight months under the
name Sean Paul Lanier, was arrested Tuesday night near his home.
   California authorities had been seeking Mack in the slaying of
Winslett, 21, of Carmichael, Calif., who disappeared in February
1987, shortly after winning the title of Miss English Leather in
Las Vegas, Nev.
   Mack was arrested by Utah police acting on a tip from a Marion,
Ohio, woman who had watched the Sunday night showing of Fox
Broadcasting Co.'s ``America's Most Wanted'' program and recognized
Mack as having once worked at a country club where she works.
   The woman also recalled receiving a call from a man in Salt Lake
City who wanted information about a man named Lanier prior to
entering into a business deal, Telles said.
   Ohio authorities contacted Sacramento County, which then alerted
Salt Lake City police. A check revealed that a Sean Paul Lanier had
been involved in an October 1987 traffic accident and had produced
an Ohio driver's license.
   Sacramento police allege Mack lured Winslett to his apartment to
be photographed for a possible calendar spread, then killed her
with a ``massive dose'' of the painkiller Percodan.
   Winslett's decomposed body was found in her sports car in a
parking lot.
   Mack also is sought for questioning by Ohio authorities in the
1981 slaying of Annette Huddle, 19, who had worked as a temporary
secretary for Mack at the Marion Country Club.
   Salt Lake City police said Mack has used six or more aliases and
has been married seven or eight times. A convicted forger and
burglar, Mack served two prison terms and was paroled in 1985.

   A Justice Department official said Thursday
there are more grand jury investigations under way into
price-fixing, bid-rigging and other criminal antitrust violations
than at any time in this century.
   In a speech, Assistant Attorney General Charles F. Rule defended
the Reagan administration's approach to antitrust enforcement which
emphasizes price-fixing prosecutions while making it easier for
mergers to occur.
   ``Criminal antitrust enforcement today is at an all-time high,'
Rule said. He said that in the first seven years of the Reagan
administration, the Justice Department's antitrust division, which
he heads, has filed 555 criminal antitrust cases. The division
filed 531 criminal antitrust cases from 1890 when the Sherman Act
was passed to 1949.
   The department has vigorously pursued bid-rigging in the
roadbuilding and auction industries and other areas of business.
   ``Reporters don't believe protecting consumers is news unless
you block a merger between two steel companies or indict the head
of one of the country's biggest corporations,'' Rule said. ``In
fact, we file cases every week that have more direct impact on
consumers than both of those actions together.''

<TEXT>
   Former Mayor Lee Alexander, a one-time
leader among the nation's big-city mayors, was sentenced Thursday
to 10 years in prison for orchestrating a $1.5 million
extortion-kickback scheme.
   Alexander, 60, spent 16 years as mayor of New York's
fifth-largest city and often was a spokesman for the nation's
mayors. He has served as president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors
and the National Conference of Democratic Mayors.
   In a Jan. 6 plea agreement, he admitted to charges of
racketeering, conspiracy to obstruct a government investigation and
tax evasion.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas J. McAvoy also ordered Alexander to
pay $100,000 in restitution to Syracuse in lieu of a $100,000 fine
recommended by federal prosecutors.
   ``I've brought great pain to my loved ones and the people of my
city and stand here now ready for my punishment,'' Alexander said
at the close of a 10-minute statement. ``The punishment you are
about to impose on me ... pales against the pain and remorse I
feel.''
   Alexander offered an explanation for his demise, saying it
occurred when an effort to build a political war chest was
``allowed to grow into a cancer.''
   Before Alexander spoke, his attorney, Harold Boreanaz, made a
50-minute impassioned plea and denied charges that Alexander had
not cooperated with prosecutors in identifying his assets.
   ``While you brought the city national attention and did many
fine things for the city, your criminal actions have placed
national attention on it again in another light and for that you
must pay,'' McAvoy said.
   There had been speculation Alexander was in line for a
high-level job in federal government and that he might some day run
for governor. Democratic Party leaders made him their candidate for
the U.S. Senate in 1974, but he lost the primary to former U.S.
Attorney General Ramsey Clark.
   Alexander was indicted July 16, 1986, by a special grand jury
empaneled 18 months earlier. He initially denied the charges but
later sought a plea bargain.
   A 40-count indictment accused Alexander of 65 acts of extortion.
It charged that Alexander extorted money from businessmen,
professionals and consultants.
   Alexander has already turned over to prosecutors more than $1.4
million in assets the government has linked with the
extortion-kickback scheme he admitted running during four terms as
mayor from 1970 to 1986.
   Seven others co-conspirators also were to be sentenced Thursday.
   Alexander will be eligible for parole afer serving a third of
his sentence. U.S. Attorney Frederick Scullin said Alexander must
surrender by April 14. The prison has not been determined.

<HEAD>Pakistan Withdraws Demand For Interim Government In Afghanistan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan has removed a major obstacle to a
settlement of the war in Afghanistan by withdrawing its demand for
formation of an interim government, a senior U.S. official said
Thursday.
   The Soviet Union, charging Pakistan with bad faith, had refused
to complete an agreement for withdrawal of an estimated 120,000
troops from the war-torn country.
   Initially, the United States supported the demand of its ally,
which is negotiating terms of a settlement with the Afghan
government through a United Nations mediator.
   But the Reagan administration subsequently back-pedaled _ while
pressing its own demand that the Soviets cease their military aid
to the Marxist government.
   The U.S. official said Pakistan was now willing to have the Red
Army retreat even while the U.N. mediator, Diego Cordovez,
consulted with warring factions on formation of a transition
government.
   ``The interim government issue, which has been an obstacle, is
now swiftly soluble,'' he said.
   The official, who played a leading role in talks here this week
with Soviet officials, briefed reporters under rules that gave him
anonymity.
   Pakistan had contended that the safe return of millions of
Afghan refugees to their homeland would not be possible under the
current government in Kabul.
   The U.S. official said the only major remaining issue was a
U.S.-Soviet dispute on military aid.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Wednesday night ruled out
any agreement to end the war in Afghanistan unless the Soviet Union
suspended military aid to the pro-Moscow government.
   He said Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze had rejected the
proposal, which would include a suspension in U.S. support for the
Afghan resistance.
   The moratorium would be in effect during the Soviet pullout and
for three additional months. The U.S. official said ``it would
allow the dust to settle'' without prejudice to U.S. and Soviet
claims to back rival factions.
   ``They didn't feel they could agree to that,'' Shultz said.
   And yet, Shultz said, ``those conditions are needed for us to be
able to sign as a guarantor'' of the Geneva agreement to end the
war.
   Shevardnadze told reporters before flying home that the Soviet
Union had no intention of stopping its aid to the Afghan government.
   The aid is required by a Soviet-Afghan treaty, ``those are
legitimate supplies, and we are not going to rescind that treaty,''
Shevardnadze said.
   Shultz said the Soviets were willing to withdraw the Red Army by
the end of the year, beginning with a 50 percent pullout during the
first three months in which the agreement was in effect.
   The guarantee of a withdrawal filled ``a great big hole'' in the
situation, Shultz said.
   But, he said, Soviet military aid to the Marxist government must
cease for stability to return to the war-torn country and for an
estimated 5 million refugees to go home.
   ``The proposal remains on the table,'' Shultz said. ``If our
thought or something close to it is accepted we would be pleased to
sign on as a guarantor.''
   The U.S. official who briefed reporters on Thursday said the
pullout could be carried out over 7{ months.

<TEXT>
   Smokers reacted with irritation Thursday to
Northwest Airline's plans to ban smoking on all domestic routes
except those to and from Hawaii.
   ``I think it stinks,'' said Dennis Kenyon, 43, as he puffed a
cigarette in a designated smoking area of Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport. ``I'll fly any other airline before I fly
Northwest.''
   A frequent business flier, the St. Paul Park salesman said the
ban is unreasonable. ``It's hard for me to believe that cigarette
smoke bothers someone 20 rows away,'' he said.
   Northwest, based in Eagan, Minn., announced the ban Wednesday,
becoming the first major American carrier to prohibit smoking on
extended flights.
   Airline officials said the ban, which also applies to some
foreign flights, was a response to employees' and passengers'
requests, and they predicted it would attract more people than it
would drive away.
   A.B. ``Sky'' Magary, Northwest's executive vice president for
marketing, said in New York Wednesday said a survey found that nine
out of 10 passengers prefer to sit in the no-smoking section, and
that even 30 percent of the smokers supported a ban on smoking in
flight.
   One non-smoker at the Minneapolis airport Thursday said it
didn't make much difference to him.
   ``As long as they have a smoking section, it doesn't matter,''
said Larry Briggs of Ashland, Ohio.
   Dan Bridges of Memphis, Tenn., said he travels in the
non-smoking secion ``and it's never been a problem.''
   Some analysts believe Northwest, the nation's fifth largest
carrier, risks losing customers. Other major airlines said they
have no immediate plans to follow suit.
   Kenyon's wife, Joann, who manages an airport gift shop, said she
has heard many smokers grumble about Northwest's action.
   ``They're not going to fly Northwest. They're going to do
anything they can not to fly Northwest,'' she said.
   ``When I go to California, there's no way I'm going to sit for
six hours and not smoke,'' said Todd Parron, a college student from
the Cincinnati suburb of Silverton. ``I'd find another flight and
take it.''
   However, one non-smoker at the Cincinnati airport said
Northwest's move will make her more likely to choose it over other
airlines.
   ``Those airplane cabins are too small. Even with smoking only in
the back rows, smoke still bothers me,'' said Erin Weglicki of
Memphis, Tenn. ``It would make a difference to me in choosing an
airline. It's a pretty brave move on their part.''
   Under new federal regulations going into effect April 23,
smoking will be banned on all domestic flights of less than two
hours. Violators will face civil fines of as much as $1,000.
   Northwest's policy will take effect the same day.
   Some smokers said they can live with Northwest's policy.
   ``It's probably a good idea,'' Janice Davis, a Boston real
estate broker, told the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch. ``I can
get by without smoking.''

   Rep. James Howard, D-N.J., was hospitalized in
very critical condition today after suffering a heart attack while
playing golf, the hospital said.
   Howard, the chairman of the House Public Works and

Country Club in Rockville, Md., said a woman who answered the
club's telephone.
   He was taken to Montgomery General Hospital in Olney, Md., where
spokeswoman Linda Janzik said Howard had had a heart attack and his
heart had stopped.
   But his heart was revived and, four hours after the attack, he
was ``breathing on his own and talking,'' Janzik said.
   Howard was later transferred to the Washington Hospital Center.
   A former schoolteacher and principal, Howard has been in
Congress since 1965.
   Howard has suffered two heart attacks during his more than two
decades in Congress. He was hospitalized for several days in 1984
in an episode doctors attributed to fatigue. He is a heavy
cigarette smoker.
   He has been chairman of the public works committee since 1981.

   The Senate voted 93-2 today to allow
Republicans to continue delaying action on a bill requiring the
government to warn workers about carcinogens and other job hazards.
   The vote against shutting off a GOP filibuster allows members of
both parties to start offering amendments to a weakened version of
the measure that was substituted Wednesday night in an effort to
win more support for it.
   Only Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Claiborne
Pell of Rhode Island voted to stop the filibuster.
   ``Once this vote is disposed of, the bill is open to
amendments,'' Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the bill's chief
author, said today. ``There is nothing unseemly about making
changes in a bill on the floor of the Senate.''
   However, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the leader of the filibuster,
called the new, weaker version a ``fire sale'' to special interests
made for ``the perception of a political victory.''
   Hatch, after refusing Wednesday to allow Democratic amendments
to weaken the bill, indicated he is prepared to continue his
filibuster.
   ``We intend to talk a little more at length to explain the
problems with this bill,'' Hatch said today. ``You can't do it in a
few hours.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee, substituted the weaker version at
Metzenbaum's request in response to Hatch's filibuster.
   The legislation is aimed at what the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health says are the one in every four
Americans who have been exposed to carcinogens or other hazardous
substances on the job.
   The ``High Risk Occupational Disease Notification and Prevention
Act'' would establish a seven-member panel of scientists to
determine the biggest hazards in workplaces and identify what
groups of workers are most at risk.
   The government would then have to notify between 100,000 and
300,000 of those workers individually each year, and their
employers would have to provide them with annual medical monitoring
tests costing up to $250 each.
   A similar bill was passed by the House on a 225-186, largely
party-line vote last October despite vehement opposition from the
Reagan administration.
   Hatch, voicing the objections of hundreds of business groups,
said the bill could open up employers to billions of dollars in
liability damages from suits by their workers and former workers
placed in the at-risk groups.
   Metzenbaum could muster only 33 votes Wednesday to cut off
Hatch's filibuster, while 59 senators, including 16 Democrats, said
they wanted the filibuster to continue.
   ``They found out that this bill is going nowhere except to the
elephant graveyard of legislation,'' said acting Senate Republican
Leader Alan Simpson of Wyoming.
   Simpson called Kennedy's substitute a ``sweeten-the-pot theory
of legislating that I find a little disturbing.''
   The new version exempts both companies with fewer than 50
workers and farms from having to continue paying wages and benefits
for up to a year to workers ordered off the job because of the
danger that might be raised by continued exposure to hazardous
substances.
   It also puts restrictions on what information from the program
could be used by workers and former workers in pursuing liability
suits against employers.
   Democrats admitted that Kennedy's parliamentary maneuver,
although allowed by Senate rules, could be used to thwart
Republicans from offering amendments of their own. But they
maintained that was not the intent.
   ``I don't think it's fair,'' said House Democratic Leader Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va. ``The parliamentary landscape has shifted. We've
seen now how senators can be shut out from offering amendments
circumstantially with no malice intended.''

   Soldiers shot two Palestinians
dead in street battles Thursday after a night of Israeli raids in
which Arabs were arrested and taken to schools converted into
detention centers.
   Seven Arabs were wounded in confrontations in the occupied West
Bank, including a 12-year-old girl shot in the left leg in Tamoun,
a village 10 miles west of Nablus, hospital officials reported.
   Thursday's deaths brought to 109 the number of Palestinians
killed since the Arab rebellion began Dec. 8 in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, according to U.N. figures. One Israeli soldier
has been killed.
   Monsignor Michel Sabbah, Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem,
canceled the traditional Palm Sunday procession from the biblical
Mount of Olives to Jerusalem's Old City because of continuing
violence.
   Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former general who now is industry and
trade minister, said Palestinians involved in the rebellion might
be expelled from Israel and the territories it has occupied since
the 1967 Middle East war.
   Israeli warplanes raided Palestinian guerrilla bases on the
outskirts of Sidon for the second straight day. It was the third
Israeli air raid into Lebanon in a week and the fifth this year.
   Soldiers have rounded up at least 700 Palestinians in the past
week in nightly sweeps through villages and refugee camps aimed at
removing leaders of the rebellion, and about 3,000 since the
rebellion began.
   Among those detained Wednesday night and early Thursday were
several men believed responsible for the latest Palestine
Liberation Organization leaflet, said Nahum Mendel, spokesman for
the Police Ministry. He would not identify them or say how many
were arrested.
   An Islamic official in Hebron said about 200 imams _ Moslem
religious leaders _ had been arrested in the West Bank city this
week. He said, on condition of anonymity, that most were members of
a fundamentalist group.
   Many of those arrested were taken to half a dozen Arab schools
the army converted into temporary detention centers, according to
Mohammed Abdel Majid Melham, a Palestinian detained Sunday night in
Halhoul High School, and other Arab reports.
   Melham, a 45-year-old pharmacist, said he was held at the school
with 12 other villagers from Halhoul, 2 miles north of Hebron,
after a midnight roundup.
   ``Six soldiers and three intelligence officers came to my house.
They handcuffed and blindfolded me, then they took me to the
school,'' he said. ``We were held in a large, open room. It was
very cold. There were no blankets or mattresses.''
   He said the detainees were transfered the next morning to a
center near Hebron and he was released Wednesday.
   Three army battle tanks, two transport vehicles and two tents
could be seen Thursday from a slope overlooking the high school's
walled compound.
   School desks were piled near the wall in one corner. Coils of
barbed wire ran along the top of the wall and an Israeli flag flew
from the roof of the three-story building.
   Troops occupied three Arab school buildings in Hebron on
Thursday and closed four in Ramallah in an apparent effort to
thwart student protests ordered in a PLO leaflet.
   An Associated Press photographer saw about 2,000 children
streaming from the Ramallah schools.
   A middle-aged Israeli officer guarding the entrance of Hussein
High School said soldiers moved into it at about dawn and would
remain until sunset.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Israeli officials rounded up at
least 15 Palestinians overnight, bringing to more than 110 arrested
there in four days, the Gaza Lawyers Association said.
   Raji Sourani, a member of the association, said it counts only
arrests reported by family members. He estimated the the true
number of detentions in four days at 350.
   The army confirms making arrests but has refused to give numbers
or details.
   Sourani said Israeli authorities limit visits by Gaza lawyers
with their jailed clients to the hours of 8 a.m.-2 p.m. each
Tuesday and require written permission from the military command.
   Army spokesmen said the two Palestinians were killed when
soldiers fired on a crowd throwing rocks and bottles in the the
Balata refugee camp near Nablus.
   Officials at Al Ittihad hospital said Majid Mohammed Ahmed
Sawalma, 21, died of four bullet wounds in the chest and heart and
Mohammed Ali Abu Zor, 19, was dead on arrival with a gunshot wound
in the neck.

   Commissioners of the South Carolina State
Museum are suing a slot machine, but only because they want to keep
it around.
   State law forbids possession of a slot machine, but the state
museum commission has an old one-armed bandit it hopes to display
after the new museum opens later this year.
   To get around the law, the museum needs to have a judge rule
that the law is inapplicable in this case.
   But before a judge can rule, there has to be a lawsuit.
   Since there was nobody available to sue, museum sued the slot
machine, said Jane McCue Johnson, the assistant attorney general
who is handling the case of South Carolina Museum Commission vs.
One Mills Slot Machine.
   The machine, now in the custody of the State Law Enforcement
Division, is not represented by counsel.
   The mechanical, wood-and-steel slot machine was built about 50
years ago by Mills Novelty Co. in Chicago.
   It was given to the museum recently by James Graham Jr. of
Newberry, who discovered it under a blanket while he was preparing
to sell his father's country store.
   ``The plaintiff is informed and believes the slot machine is of
significant historical value as a reflection of the history and
customs of the people of South Carolina, said the complaint filed
in Richland County Court of Common Pleas.
   ``You put a nickel in and it works _ or so I'm told. I didn't
try it because it's illegal,'' said Rodger Stroup, the museum's
chief curator.
   He said the machine won't be used for play, just display, if the
museum is allowed to keep it.
   The machines were once legal, and Graham's machine bears a South
Carolina Tax Commission stamp dated June 30, 1952.

   Just as a penny saved is a penny earned,
but an hour spent may be $60 saved.
   That's the bait for prospective buyers of an apparel store owned
by Ed Dollus, who also owns the Dollus Bros. shoe store next door.
   Every business hour, Dollus is marking down the price by $60.
   When he started on Thursday, the price was $240,000.
   Karen Morgan, a clerk at the shoe store, ``is supposed to change
the price every hour, but sometimes she forgets,'' Dollus said.
   Dollus said he also would sell the three-story building which
houses the shoe store, but only if the buyer bought the three-story
apparel building.
   ``If I sell it (the shoe store building), I'm gone out of the
city of Belleville,'' Dollus said. ``But I'm going to keep selling
shoes somewhere. After 64 years in the business, I've got too many
good, faithful customers I wouldn't desert.
   ``My motto has always been `It's a feat to fit feet,' and I fit
customers with a quality shoe made in America to fit American feet.
I've never sold a plastic shoe.''

   When the world's tallest woman left her job
at the Guinness Museum of World Records to become the mayor's
tallest secretary, she didn't have a thing to wear.
   The clothes Sandy Allen had worn as a``live attraction'' at the
Guinness museum in Niagara Falls, Ontario, for eight years were too
informal for the office of Mayor William H. Hudnut III.
   But at 7 feet, 7\ inches, off the rack was out of the question.
   Thanks to some helpful seamstresses and consultants, however,
the 32-year-old Shelbyville native goes to work in style.
   ``Sandy's circumstances bring a whole new meaning to `I haven't
a thing to wear,' '' said Sherry Boram, a personal image consultant
with Color 1 Associates.
   The two women hit it off immediately and Ms. Boram, who lives in
Pendleton, began organizing the forces to bring Miss Allen's
wardrobe up to date.
   Ms. Boram first planned a ``capsule wardrobe'' that included
nine color-coordinated pieces that could be mixed and matched.
   Then she recruited volunteer seamstresses, sewing supply
retailers, pattern drafters and fitters to produce Miss Allen's
tailor-made wardrobe.
   Three Purdue University instructors and six students drafted the
sewing patterns and several area merchants donated fabric and
notions for the project.
   The 24 members of the American Sewing Guild's Indianapolis
chapter made the garments.
   The project also included making custom-sized accessories,
including a shoulder bag, a reversible vest and more than 30
handmade wooden clothes hangers.
   ``I'm quite flattered,'' Miss Allen said. ``Saying thank you
doesn't seem enough.
   ``I'll be at least a half-hour late for work every morning
because, with all of my lovely new clothes, I'll have a hard time
deciding which to wear,'' she said.

   The National Park Service says the White House
will be a safer place and have a better-looking sidewalk in front
of it when a million-dollar-plus construction project is completed
in July.
   The project, a compromise between security requirements of the
Secret Service and aesthetic standards of the Commission of Fine
Arts, has gone through several changes since it was first proposed.
   The first proposal was a 42-inch-high concrete wall, with the
White House's existing ornamental iron fence on top of it,
according to Charles H. Atherton, administative officer of the arts
panel.
   ``It would have made the White House look even more like a
fortress,'' Atherton said. The commission must approve design
changes affecting federal buildings and momuments in the central
are of Washington.
   After the terrorist attack on the Marine barracks in Lebanon in
1983, which killed 241 American servicemen, low concrete walls
called jersey barriers were erected around the White House and many
other public buildings in Washington.
   ``That was always regarded as a temporary measure,'' said Park
Service spokesman Jim McDaniel.
   After the wall was rejected, there were discussions between the
arts commission and the Park Service, with advice from the Secret
Service, resulting in the present plan.
   It consists of 274 bollards, or thick cement and aggregate
posts, each 38 inches high, placed four feet apart and joined by
chains, along 832 feet of Pennsylvania Avenue sidewalk.
   ``We, of course, would have hoped that they would be farther
apart,'' Atherton said of the bollards. ``They're actually awfully
close together.''
   The Secret Service, however, determined that this spacing was
the most effective way to stop a vehicle of a certain size, going
at a certain speed, from crashing into the White House.
   ``We certainly agree that the first order of business would be
the protection of the president at any cost, and if the aesthetic
element has to be compromised, so be it, sad as that may be,'' said
Atherton.
   ``I think the Secret Service feels that we now have a system
that will do the job physically and at the same time we hope will
be more acceptable to look at. It certainly, I think, will be more
acceptable than the original scheme.''
   McDaniel said the Park Service, which is in charge of the White
House grounds, dealt separately with the Secret Service and the
commission.
   ``You play one against the other,'' he said. ``If you work hard
at it, you can usually find a solution.''
   The first phase of the project is scheduled for completion in
July.
   McDaniel said the security work will cost $670,000 and the Park
Service is spending an additional $365,000 to replace the sidewalk
with a more decorative granite walk with trees and tree boxes.
   A second phase is expected to be completed about the end of
July, but McDaniel said the cost has not been determined.

<HEAD>Chief, Officers In Small Town Feud Other Over Incident Involving
Girl</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 3rd graf to CORRECT Horne to Hensley.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>APOPKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The police department in this Central
Florida community is in turmoil over allegations by lower-ranking
officers that a captain took a teen-age girl along on a
confidential stakeout and kissed her against her will.
   The alleged incident last month resulted in the demotion of
Capt. Doyle Hensley, 42, to lieutenant and has led to a state
investigation and several internal investigations.
   Hensley had supervised an investigation last month on similar
charges against the officer who relayed the latest allegations.
   The chief of the 45-member force is suspicious.
   ``I haven't been able to prove that it's a setup yet,'' Chief
Tom Collins said Wednesday. ``Sooner or later, I'll find out. Some
officers may be running scared right now.''
   The officers who investigated the captain and had pictures taken
of him and the 16-year-old girl deny any setup.
   Hensley declined comment.
   Collins said the problems began when Hensley asked the girl, who
lives with a roommate and works as a waitress, to join him on a
stakeout at the local high school on Feb. 26.
   The girl said this week she was interested in police work but
was ``half afraid'' of Hensley because of his flirtatious comment
that it would be cold and she might have to keep him warm. She said
she told officer Greg Horne about the invitation.
   Horne passed the girl's comment on to Sgt. Jeff Ujcic, who then
notified his lieutenant, Ralph Caldwell.
   Last month, Horne was the target of an internal investigation,
supervised by Hensley, into accusations that he was dating another
teen-ager.
   Caldwell and Ujcic enlisted former police officer Gary Granttham
to take pictures when Hensley picked up the girl at the restaurant.
Also in the parking lot was a carload of the girl's friends, whom
she had asked to follow her. Hensley realized he was being followed
and gave them the slip, Collins said.
   ``What disturbed me the most is that this was supposedly a
confidential mission'' to catch suspected burglars, Caldwell said.
``This special operation was no longer a special operation.
Everybody and their brother knew about it.''
   The chief isn't happy that his nightshift officers started
investigating a fellow officer on their own. He is investigating
Horne's role.
   Meanwhile, Horne's family has befriended the teen-ager, and she
has complained to the state attorney's office that two officers
pressured her to withdraw her complaint about Hensley.
   The chief is angry that the officers got civilians involved _
Granttham and the Horne family.
   ``I don't need their help,'' Collins said. ``I can take care of
my own shop. I will take them to court if they slander my name.''
   State Attorney Robert Eagan said in Orlando, ``We're looking at
a matter involving the police up there. We're taking statements
from witnesses.''

   Honduras said today it filed a
protest with Nicaragua over an alleged incursion by Sandinista
soldiers in the same spot where Nicaraguan troops fought Contra
rebels last week.
   Nicaragua denied its troops crossed the border.
   A Foreign Ministry communique said a total of nearly 460
Sandinistas crossed the border late Tuesday. An ``energetic
protest'' was filed with Nicaragua over the incident, it said.
   It said 300 heavily armed Sandinistas entered about 8 p.m.
Tuesday in the San Andres de Bocay region in Olancho province,
where Sandinistas chased Contras back across the border last week.
It is about 150 miles east of this capital city.
   At the same time, 50 Nicaraguan soldiers entered at the village
of Pico Espanol in El Paraiso province. The village is about two
miles from the Nicaraguan border.
   The statement, read to The Associated Press by telephone, did
not say if there were any confrontations in the areas or whether
the troops were still believed to be inside the country.
   In Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, a Defense Ministry spokesman
was asked about the report. ``That's negative,'' he said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   A Honduran military official had reported the new incursion on
Wednesday.
   ``We don't know the purpose of this new entry and violation of
our country, but the situation is being studied by the high
command,'' the official said.
   ``It's a matter of small armed groups of Sandinistas. Because of
that, the state of alert continues for all combat units of the
armed forces,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The location was given as the San Andres de Bocay region in
Olancho province, but no other details were available.
   In Washington, a government source speaking on condition of
anonymity, said there had been unconfirmed reports that an
estimated 300 Sandinista soldiers had entered Honduras.
   The reported incursion did not affect peace talks then under way
between top Sandinista and Contra officials in Nicaragua, even
though both sides said their forces would stop fighting during the
talks. Late Wednesday, the talks produced an accord calling for a
60-day cease-fire beginning April 1.
   Earlier Wednesday, Pentagon officials in Washington had said
that unless the military situation in Honduran changes, the
approximately 3,200 U.S. troops sent to Honduras last week would
return home early next week.
   The U.S. troops were ordered to Honduras as a show of force
after 2,000 Sandinsta soldiers allegedly chased Contra rebels from
Nicaragua into Honduras.

<HEAD>Educators Decry Trend Toward Standardized Testing in Kindergarten</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two education associations called for an end
Thursday to what they called the growing practice of subjecting
kindergarten children to standardized tests to determine promotion
to first grade.
   The groups said the same tests are being used to determine
whether a youngster is admitted to kindergarten or advised to spend
another year in preschool.
   ``Our children are being tested too early and failed too soon,
and parents should ask for what purpose,'' said Sue Bredekamp,
accreditation director of the National Association for the
Education of Young Children.
   Her group was joined by the National Association of Early
Childhood Specialists in State Departments of Education calling for
an end to mass standardized testing of children before the third
grade.
   They said they did not object to testing of individual children
whose teachers or parents suspect they have a learning or
developmental problem. But for most children, they said, ``Parents
should trust their own instincts and the observations of trained
and experienced preschool and kindergarten teachers.''
   Leaders of the groups said at a news conference they do not know
how many schools are resorting to standardized placement or
promotion tests for 4-, 5-and 6-year-olds.
   But Bredekamp said that in some areas, ``it is not unusual now
for 20 percent or more of young children to be advised to wait a
year before entering kindergarten, or to `flunk' kindergarten, or
to be assigned to a special track called `readiness,'
`transitional' or `developmental' kindergarten.''
   Georgia recently became the first state to require standardized
testing of kindergarten children. The city of Minneapolis began
testing kindergarteners in 1984 on basic math and reading skills,
and has been holding back 10 percent of the children, most of them
minorities.
   But last September the North Carolina legislature voted to
discontinue mandatory standardized tests for first and second
graders.
   Asa Hilliard, an Atlanta child psychologist and professor at
Georgia State University, said the tests are being used to hold
children back or track them into remedial programs or special
education, despite a lack of evidence that such steps improve their
schooling.
   He said the tests have ``a disproportionate impact on those
children who need school the most, the minority children.''
   Bredekamp said testing ``narrows and misdirects the curriculum.''
   ``The most important things to learn in kindergarten, such as
self-esteem, social competence, confidence, self-discipline, desire
to learn, cannot be measured on standardized tests,'' she said.
   Louise Bates Ames, co-founder of the Gesell Institute, which
produces a widely used screening test, said it was ``discouraging
that these groups have taken this political position.''
   ``Our position is that if there are 25 children in a classroom,
all acting at 5-year-old maturity level, the teacher still has to
individualize the curriculum to different ability levels. But if
you put children together at different maturity and ability levels,
then you have differences you can't possibly span,'' she said in a
telephone interview from the institute's New Haven, Conn.,
headquarters.
   Bredekamp said the testing issue ``is part of the bigger issue
of pushing academic subjects at too early an age.''
   The association's president is child psychologist David Elkind,
author of ``The Hurried Child'' and the leading critic of that
trend.
   The association has 60,000 members, including teachers and
others involved in preschool, kindergarten and early elementary
education.

<HEAD>Democrat Announces for Bill Green's Seat in Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. John Jenrette, who served a prison term for an
Abscam conviction, says he plans to challenge Democrat Robin Tallon
for his old seat from South Carolina's 6th District.
   In New York, meanwhile, John B. Levitt, a Democratic district
leader from Manhattan, announced his candidacy Thursday for the
congressional seat held by Republican Bill Green.
   ``I feel there are three urgent and pressing problems and they
haven't been addressed,'' Levitt, 28, said, citing homelessness,
drug abuse and drug trafficking, and the overcrowding of hospitals
sparked by the AIDS epidemic.
   ``They haven't been effectively dealt with everywhere in our
area or in Washington. We really need aggressive leadership and
that's what I'm offering in my campaign. I think we need a
congressman who will really go down and fight in Washington and get
dollars in this area.''
   Green, 58, has represented the 15th Congressional District since
1978. He has not made a formal announcement for re-election, but
his staff said he will.
   Jenrette, who lost his seat in 1980 after being convicted in the
Abscam scandal, told The State newspaper in Columbia on Wednesday
that he expects to make a formal announcement of his candidacy
early next month.
   Tallon declined comment on Jenrette's possible candidacy.
   Jenrette, 51, acknowledged he would be an underdog in a
Democratic primary against Tallon, a 41-year-old clothing store
operator elected in 1982.
   Jenrette was convicted in October 1980 of conspiracy and
accepting a $50,000 bribe from an FBI agent posing as an Arab
sheik. On probation after 13 months in federal prison, Jenrette is
a disbarred lawyer and reformed alcoholic.
   Jenrette said he expects a federal judge to lift his probation
before the June 14 primary.
   His felony conviction apparently does not prohibit Jenrette from
running for office or taking a seat in Congress, although he is
barred from voting in elections. According to a 1965 opinion by the
South Carolina attorney general, a candidate for the U.S. House of
Representatives does not have to be a qualified elector of the
state in order to be seated.

<TEXT>
   Smarting from an argument with his mother,
10-year-old Andres Rascon and his 7-year-old sister headed for
Mexico in the family car after everyone else was asleep, police
report.
   Police were alerted after the boy tried to sell the car to a
convenience store clerk Tuesday.
   By the time authorities caught up with the runaways, they had
traveled 65 miles south on Interstate 19 to Nogales on the
U.S.-Mexican border.
   ``Our officers were _ how do you call it? _ amused initially,
then amazed that he could do it,'' Nogales Police Capt. Antonio
Estrada said Wednesday.
   Though the youth said he planned the escapade after an argument
with his mother, Bertha Rascon, she said the only argument she
could remember occurred two weeks ago when she scolded Andres for
watching too much television.
   The boy apparently waited until everyone in his grandmother's
home had gone to sleep, then took $20 and his mother's keys to her
1984 Chevrolet sedan and slipped out a bedroom window. He persuaded
his sister, Maria Fernanda, to go along.
   ``He told me they were going to have a spin around Sonora,'' the
Mexican state immediately across the border, ``but then they
decided to return,'' his mother said.
   She said she thought the youngsters may have been trying to find
their father, who lives in Mexico, though neither has any idea just
where.
   Andres, who is 4-foot-6, added a pillow to the car seat so he
could see over the dash, Estrada said. Andres learned to drive when
he was 6, when his father plopped the boy on his lap and showed him
how to maneuver.

   After closing hospital beds in recent years, New
York City faces a crisis because it didn't foresee the virulence
and consequences of the narcotics epidemic, according to a study
released Thursday.
   From 1985 to 1987, time in hospitals increased for drug users
and for victims of the side effects of narcotics use _ AIDS
patients and babies born too puny to go home.
   Psychiatric admissions not related to drugs also increased, but
all other categories of patient care followed the predicted
downward trend.
   ``Had it not been for the growth in psychiatry, substance abuse,
AIDS and neonatal services, inpatient hospital use in New York City
would actually have fallen roughly 5 percent between July 1985 and
July 1987, as was expected by planners and regulators who oversaw
the closure of 1,800 hospital beds citywide during that period,''
the survey preparers said in a statement.
   They described the hospitals knotted in a ``medical gridlock''
in which ``literally hundreds of patients needing acute care
services spend each night in emergency rooms because no beds are
available on inpatient services.''
   ``Various forms of social pathology visible, but inadequately
addressed, in many parts of the community are coming home to roost
within the city's health care facilities,'' the study said.
   The study, prepared by the United Hospital Fund and the Bigel
Institute for Health Policy at Brandeis University, was based on
data from 69 of the city's 81 municipal and voluntary hospitals. It
covered about 89 percent of the approximately 35,000 certified
hospital beds in New York.
   Medical authorities are divided on what must be done, said Bruce
C. Vladeck, president of the United Hospitals Fund.
   ``The Greater New York Hospital Association's position is we
need another 1,500 to 2,000 beds in this city fast,'' said Vladeck.
   Others, including Dr. David Axelrod, the state health
commissioner, and Stuart H. Altman, dean of social policy graduate
studies at Brandeis, suggest a mix of community-based services,
nursing care and special housing.
   During 1985-87, hospital stays grew by 44 percent for acquired
immune deficiency syndrome patients, 15 percent each for
psychiatric and substance abuse patients and 14 percent for
newborns, the study found.
   The increases have been concentrated in low-income communities,
another indicator that the hospital occupancy crisis is grounded in
what Vladeck called the ``general socio-economic disintegration of
parts of the city.''
   Vladeck said crack, a form of cocaine, accounted for a large
part of the problem.
   In addition to admissions traceable to crack-induced psychosis,
``there's a lot of crack-related respiratory illness _ people
literally burn out their lungs smoking crack,'' he said.
``Obviously, a lot of those low-birth-weight newborns are to
crack-using mothers.''

   Officials fearing an explosion closed the
bridge between Pensacola and Gulf Breeze on Thursday after two
barges containing highly flammable chemical vapors slammed into a
fishing pier.
   Liquid cyclohexane had been unloaded from the barges before the
collision but the vessels, being pushed by a towboat, still
contained residue and dangerous vapors, said Mark Snowden,
emergency response coordinator for the Florida Department of
Environmental Regulation.
   ``If it were to explode I suspect it would be a catastrophic
explosion,'' Snowden said. Sparks from an autombile ignition or
removal efforts might be enough to set off the vapors if they
should leak, he said.
   One of the two barges was removed about two hours after the
collision about 9 a.m., but the other remained wedged into the tip
of the 1.5-mile-long Pensacola Fishing Pier.
   The pier is part of an old bridge about 75 feet from and
parallel to the U.S. 98 bridge that spans the three miles across
Pensacola Bay in the western end of the Florida Panhandle.
   The pier also was evacuated.
   The bridge was expected to remain closed for at least four
hours, and motorists faced a detour of about 50 miles. Escambia
County Administrator Gus Ellis ordered the bridge closed but he
permitted emergency vehicles to cross. The Coast Guard also ordered
all boats to stay clear.
   Authorities were waiting for representatives of Capitol Towing,
owner of the barges, to arrive from Houston before making any
decision on removing the barge.
   The vapors also could cause asphyxiation, Snowden said. The
chemical, composed in part of benzine, is used by Monstano Textile
Co. in Pensacola to make nylon for carpeting, tires and other
things. Experts from Monsanto also were on the scene.
   Weather was clear but seas were choppy and winds were gusting
from the southwest at up to 20 miles per hour when the collision
occurred.
   ``The wind caught it and blew him into the bridge (pier),'' said
Grey Jewett, risk manager for Escambia County, which owns the pier.
``It destroyed the end of the pier, a turnaround.''
   Only three anglers were at the end of the pier, and there were
no injuries.

   Less than two weeks before Gary Michael
Heidnik goes on trial on rape and murder charges, lawyers are
haggling over rights to the story that began with the discovery of
three half-naked women chained in a basement.
   A year ago Friday, police found the women, as well as the limbs
of a fourth woman in a freezer and then the naked body of a fifth
woman in a New Jersey forest.
   Heidnik's trial begins April 4, but on Wednesday in federal
bankruptcy court, attorneys for Heidnik's creditors proposed an
agreement that would assign movie, book and entertainment rights to
the estates of Heidnik and his defunct church, the United Church of
the Ministers of God. Heidnik and the church are in bankruptcy.
   In the agreement, Heidnik's attorney, A. Charles Peruto Jr.,
would get one-third of any book and movie profits. The rest would
go to Heidnik's estate for payment to the alleged victims.
   But Assistant District Attorney Harriet Brumberg argued that
state law provides that 100 percent of such profits go to victims
of crimes.
   ``If anything in the book contains any thoughts, feelings,
impressions of Mr. Heidnik, that belongs to the victims,'' Ms.
Brumberg said.
   ``If I bring in money to enhance the estates, I get one-third of
what I enhance,'' Peruto said. ``The estates would get
two-thirds.'' As part of the agreement, Peruto would not get fees
for defending Heidnik.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David A. Scholl asked for legal briefs in
the case by Tuesday and said he would issue a ruling after that.
   One author researching a Heidnik book was in court Wednesday.
And at least one other writer is said to be working on the story.
Atlanta writer Ken Englade, who has a contract with St. Martin's
Press in New York to write the book, said the story was ``lurid,''
but facinating.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was
defiant today in the face of a nationwide general strike aimed at
his ouster and said his opponents can't overthrow him.
   As the strike moved into its fourth day with no sign of letup,
Noriega once again lashed out at the opposition and the United
States in a speech to a group of about 500 supporters Wednesday
night.
   The United States, Noriega said, wants to create a Panamanian
political system ``in its image and reflecting its plans to
subject'' Central America.
   He accused the Reagan administration of misjudging the
``patriotic feelings of Panamanians'' because they ``are not made
of chocolate, nor of sugar.''
   Washington has been trying to pressure Noriega into leaving the
country.
   The general also criticized his opponents for rejecting his
offer to resign in exchange for a national dialogue, saying they
have neither the ``capacity to represent'' nor to defeat ``the
nationalistic forces.''
   An organization of 25 Latin American nations will hold an
emergency meeting Monday to discuss the crisis in Panama, the group
said Wednesday. The meeting of the Latin American Economic System
in Caracas, Venezuela, was requested by Panama.
   A prominent opposition leader, Ricardo Arias Calderon, returned
from exile to join in the fight to oust Noriega, head of the
15,000-strong Panama Defense Forces and the power behind the
civilian government.
   Almost all businesses were shut down across the country again
Wednesday. Lacking food and money, thousands of people lined up at
soup kitchens set up by churches throughout the country.
   Also Wednesday, the government ordered a U.S. diplomat expelled,
but the State Department said in Washington that economics
counselor David Miller would not leave as demanded. The State
Department said it would ignore the order because it considers
Panama's government illegitimate.
   It gave the same reason for rejecting an earlier attempt to
expel Terence Kneebone, head of the U.S. Information Service in
Panama.
   In other developments Wednesday, a dozen U.S. soldiers were
detained by Panamanian police, and 100 people shouted anit-Noriega
slogans after a funeral for a man killed at an earlier
anti-government rally.
   Panama is out of cash because Washington cut off the supply of
U.S. dollars, the Panamanian national currency, in a bid to drive
Noriega into exile. The general was indicted in the United States
last month on federal cocaine trafficking charges.
   Jose Mulino, an attorney active in the opposition National Civic
Crusade, acknowledged that some action from within the Defense
Forces may be necessary to end the monthlong crisis.
   ``There are growing pockets within the Defense Forces that are
against Noriega,'' he said. ``What we don't know is if they will
act.''
   Leaders of the crusade _ an alliance of 200 professional,
business, labor and other groups formed in June _ suggested some
officers might fear acting against Noriega because of the fate of
11 military rebels taken into custody after an abortive coup
attempt last week.
   Osvaldo Velasquez, head of the Panamanian Committee for Human
Rights, said Wednesday, ``We know for certain they are being
tortured.''
   Defense Forces members are due to be paid at the end of the
week. Opposition leaders said their loyalty to Noriega could fade
if they, like most other Panamanians, are unable to cash their
checks because of the freeze on the country's deposits in U.S.
banks.
   Arias Calderon, president of the opposition Christian Democratic
Party, told a news conference Wednesday in San Jose, Costa Rica,
that he would return to Panama today because: ``I want to share
with the Panamanian people in the dramatic days of fighting for
democratization of the country.''
   Authorities refused to allow Arias Calderon to enter the country
last month on his return from a business trip. He said he would be
accompanied on an afternoon flight by legislators from Central
American and European countries.
   About 300 people attended the funeral Wednesday of Alcibiades
Vasquez, 24, a private security guard shot during rioting last
week. The Panamanian human rights panel said he was killed by a
pro-government paramilitary squad.
   His death was the first in nearly a month of often violent civil
unrest that began after President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to
fire Noriega on Feb. 25 and was dismissed the next day. The United
States still recognizes Delvalle, who is in hiding in Panama.

   A group promoting the religious freedom clause
in the U.S. Constitution announced plans Thursday to hold a ``first
liberty'' summit to call attention to the religious liberties
enjoyed by Americans.
   The Williamsburg Charter Foundation said it will hold its summit
in Williamsburg, Va., June 24 and 25. During the summit national
political, business and religious leaders will sign a charter that
celebrates the religious clause in the First Amendment to the
Constitution and reaffirms freedom on conscience for people of all
faiths.
   ``The First Amendment begins with freedom on conscience, and
upon this premise all other freedoms are made possible,'' said
foundation chairman Alonzo L. McDonald. ``These clauses allow us to
live with our deepest differences and encourage pluralism and
diversity of opinion.''
   The non-sectarian foundation already has released a survey of
American attitudes on religion in public life and is sponsoring a
symposium of scholars and religious leaders next month in
Charlottesville, Va.

   Communism suffered its first Big Mac
attack Thursday as McDonald's opened a restaurant in Yugoslavia,
and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours
from getting too unruly under the golden arches.
   ``I just wanted to taste genuine American hamburgers,'' said
Milica Nikolic, a high school student who waited for three hours to
taste her first Big Mac.
   People curiously examined the renovated restaurant's plush
interior and the back-lit signs depicting the hamburgers, french
fries, milk shakes and other fare more familiar in the West. It
also featured amber-colored tables and floors, pastel-colored
upholstery, modern art paintings and discreet illumination.
   The fast-food outlet, located on a downtown square, had drawn
crowds in recent days, and they began gathering long before it
opened Thursday.
   Police kept watch on the lines of customers snaking around the
block, and they regulated the number who came inside to avoid
overcrowding.
   ``No opening of a restaurant in Belgrade has created such a
sensation as this one today,'' one policeman said.
   ``I think this restaurant has no competition in Belgrade,'' said
Milica Danic, a housewife who treated her son to a cheeseburger.
``It is much cleaner, the service is faster, the interior is nicer
and it is not too expensive.''
   The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of McDonald's
in Yugoslavia depends on its acceptance by citizens long accustomed
to a hamburger-like fast-food dish called the Pljeskavica: ground
pork and onions on a bun.
   ``In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac and
Pljeskavica,'' said Vesna Milosevic, an official of Genex, a
Yugoslav state-run enterprise that has contracted a joint venture
agreement with McDonald's.
   ``Our aim is not to destroy the Pljeskavica on the Yugoslav
market,'' said Predrag Dostanic, managing director of the
Genex-McDonald's. ``We want to change customs of the local people
used to completly different eating habits.''
   He said that lounging at tables for a long time after a finished
meal will draw a warning. Also, smoking is forbidden and alcohol
will not be served.
   This contrasts sharply with the Balkan and Yugoslav custom of
sitting with a drink in smoke-filled restaurants and chatting with
friends after the meal.
   The Big Mac meal, consisting of a hamburger, soft drink and
french fries costs the equivalent of $2.57, or about as much the
similar meal would cost in numerous Pljeskavica joints around town.
   Sadik Seljami, a waiter in a small Pljeskavica outlet just a few
hundred yards from the McDonald's, suggested that the American
restaurant wants to drive Yugoslav fast-food outlets out of
business.
   ``However, we will not give up the fight even if we have to
lower the prices,'' said Seljami.
   Glen Cook, an executive of the McDonald's Corp., said during the
opening ceremonies, ``We are very excited about the opening of this
restaurant, not only because it is the first one in a communist
country, but also because it is one of the nicest in Europe.''
   McDonald's and Genex contribute $1 million each for the flagship
restaurant. They will also share the profits equally even though it
will be managed entirely by Yugoslavs.
   The restaurant has 350 seats and employs 110 people capable of
serving 2,500 meals per hour. In an effort to keep a high level of
services, the management is entitled to fire any employees who fail
to perform.
   The American corporation plans to open five additional
restaurants Yugoslavia in the next five years. The next East
European McDonald's, and the first in a Soviet bloc country, is to
open next month in Budapest, Hungary.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld the
convictions of two men found guilty of setting a fire at hotel fire
in Puerto Rico that killed 97 people.
   The 1st U.S. Court of Appeals rejected arguments by Armando
Jimenez Rivera and Jose Francisco Rivera Lopez that the trial judge
abused his discretion in sentencing them to 75 years and 99 years
in prison, respectively.
   Jimenez Rivera and Rivera Lopez, both workers at the Dupont
Plaza Hotel, admitted setting the fire as part of a labor dispute
with hotel management.
   The fire on New Year's Eve 1986 at the beachfront hotel also
injured more than 140 people.
   In return for their guilty pleas and cooperation in the
investigation, the government had recommended a maximum penalty of
25 years in prison for Rivera Lopez and 24 years for Jimenez
-Rivera.
   U.S. District Judge Jose Antonio Fuste of Puerto Rico rejected
the government's recommendation, saying the crimes amounted to
felony murder. The judge also noted that a third man convicted in
the case was found guilty of first-degree murder.
   Jimenez Rivera and Rivera Lopez appealed on the grounds that the
judge's remarks at sentencing were improper and that Fuste failed
to consider migating factors.
   ``The judge's concern over the deaths that resulted from their
crime indicates that he determined the sentence in reference to the
particular actions'' of the two men, the appeals court said.
   The justices did, however, order Fuste to hold a new hearing on
the Rivera Lopez sentencing to determine if he relied on inaccurate
statements in a pre-sentencing report. If so, the court said he
should hold a new sentencing hearing.

   Israeli jets bombed Palestinian targets on
the outskirts of Sidon for the second straight day Thursday,
hitting a base of Abu Nidal's guerrilla faction.
   Police said nine people were killed and five wounded in the
raid, the third this week near the port city 25 miles south of
Lebanon.
   Police said most of the casualties were members of Nidal's
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, and the group issued a statement
pledging ``merciless retaliation.''
   A police spokesman described the attack as ``very fierce.'' He
said six Israeli warplanes dropped 30 bombs in six sorties within
55 minutes.
   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss instructed the country's U.N.
ambassador, Rashid Fakhoury, to complain to the world body about
the Israeli attacks, state radio said.
   But Lebanon did not ask for a Security Council meeting on the
issue, it said.
   The police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in
keeping with standing regulations, said the main target of the raid
was Nidal's guerrilla base, but the jets also hit a position of the
Marxist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   ``The Israelis plowed the olive groves where the stricken bases
are,'' he added.
   The bases were engulfed by smoke and dust as ambulances arrived
to evacuate casualties.
   The police spokesman said Nidal's guerrillas cordoned off the
bases in the villages of Bekasta, Majdelyoun, Salhiyeh and Abra on
the southern and eastern edges of Sidon.
   The attacking jets dropped scarlet balloons to deflect
heat-seeking missiles. The guerrillas fired at the roaring jets
with Soviet-made anti-aircraft guns. No hits were reported.
   ``Let the enemy wait for coming blows of our revolutionary
fighters,'' said a statement issued by the Fatah-Revolutionary
Council. ``We shall strike doubly in merciless retaliation.''
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, broke away from
Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974. He has
since claimed attacks against a series of civilian targets around
the world.
   The elusive terrorist mastermind tops wanted lists in the United
States and Europe. His whereabouts are not known, altough recent
reports said he has been shuttling between Libya and Algeria.
   His group had also vowed revenge after Wednesday's strike,
saying in a statement it would ``severely strike back against the
zionist enemy's arrogance and barbarism ... At the right time and
place.''
   Wednesday's attack also targeted Abu Nidal and DFLP bases,
killing seven people and wounding 15.
   The DFLP, headed by Nayef Hawatmeh, is one of the PLO's largest
factions.

<HEAD>South Korean Government Corruption Scandal Grows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Chun Doo-hwan decided
to cut short a visit to the United States after prosecutors linked
his brother to a growing government corruption scandal, officials
said Thursday.
   The prosecutor general's office said its inquiry of corruption
involving the Saemaul development group may be expanded to
investigate other possible wrongdoings under the Chun
administration.
   Chun, who has not been implicated, yielded power on Feb. 25 to
President Roh Tae-woo. But Chun has clung to a measure of power
behind the scenes.
   Prosecutors said Thursday that about 200 Saemaul and government
officials had been questioned since Monday to find out if Chun's
younger brother, former Saemaul leader Chun Kyung-hwan, and his
aides amassed fortunes by embezzling the group's funds.
   The former president was on a three-week private visit to the
United States in which he met with President Reagan on Wednesday,
but South Korean officials said Thursday he planned to leave early.
   The opposition parties contend the government is trying to hide
the extent of corruption under Chun. They have called for a broader
inquiry that would look into any corruption by the Chun family and
supporters.
   The ruling Democratic Justice Party has rejected the charges as
an attempt to blacken the government's reputation. But its leaders
promised to investigate any official corruption.
   The semi-official Saemaul, or ``new community,'' is a group of
community leaders that has evolved into a huge organization since
it was created in 1971 to promote urban development. It has
launched projects from building model communities to organizing
neighborhood clean-ups.
   But critics have said Saemaul worked with past authoritarian
governments to organize support and dole out patronage.
   Prosecutors said Thursday they had uncovered more evidence that
Saemaul officials embezzled millions of dollars, peddled government
patronage and misappropriated property. They said they questioned
government officials to find out if they aided corrruption within
Saemaul.
   Prosecutors also said the younger Chun was suspected of
diverting Saemaul funds to personal land speculation and of making
money with influence peddling. Local newspapers reported the
younger Chun and his aides may soon be officially charged with
corruption, but prosecutors declined to confirm the reports.
   Many in South Korea believe the new government is using the
Saemaul investigation to discredit the former president.
   Roh, a former general who helped put Chun into power with
military backing in 1980, has vowed to end authoritarian rule and
has been moving to cut ties with the former president. Top Chun
supporters have been removed from the ruling party and the former
president's role as a government adviser has been reduced to a
largely ceremonial function.
   However, members of the opposition Party for Peace and Democracy
say Roe may also have been involved in the corruption when he
served as home minister in 1982.

   A turkey chase left 71-year-old Lucille
Andrews stuck in the mud in her car for two days. ``Miss
Curiosity'' had a wonderful time.
   When she was located Wednesday by frantic relatives, the St.
Clair County woman said she spent her time spying on wildlife, and
wasn't concerned about food and water.
   ``I was no more scared than I am right now,'' Mrs. Andrews said
from her home. ``I knew someone would find me.''
   The air and ground search began after she was reported missing
Monday afternoon.
   Mrs. Andrews said she had been out driving, and caught site of a
turkey.
   ``I saw that turkey going out there and I thought, `You fool
thing. If you got a nest out there, I'm going to follow you and
find you,''' she said.
   She followed the turkey across a field, but her car got stuck in
a swampy ditch.
   ``At night, I locked the doors and rolled up the windows and
went to sleep. During the day, I looked around and thought, `Boy
I'd like to have my house up on that hill,''' she said.
   Mrs. Andrews didn't see the turkey again, but did see three deer
and a bear cub.
   ``The moon was shining so bright that I raised my head up and
there was a little old bear. He was just a baby,'' she said.
   While Mrs. Andrews communed with nature, her eight children,
most of her 15 grandchildren and assorted friends and relatives
formed a ``family posse'' that combed the woods around her house.
   ``We were driving everywhere,'' said grandson Mark Andrews, 21.
   Andrews said his grandmother, who walks with a cane because of
arthritis, is called ``Miss Curiosity'' by family members because
``she's always doing something.''
   ``I hate housework and all of that stuff, but I do love to
drive,'' Mrs. Andrew said. ``If I had to stay in the house I think
I would die.''

<HEAD>Oil Exploration Off Florida Keys Dropped for Five Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD W. SWINTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KEY LARGO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal plan to allow oil and gas
exploration off the Florida Keys was dropped for five years
Thursday after state officials agreed to withdraw pending legal
challenges.
   ``This is to benefit not only the environment, but the tourist
industry and the people who live along the shores,'' Gov. Bob
Martinez said at a ceremony on a Key Largo beach. ``I think this
decision is a flagship-type decision that other states will use.''
   Martinez and U.S. Interior Department Secretary Donald Hodel
announced separately the settlement which removes about 11.1
million offshore acres from a five-year leasing plan. The preserved
area goes from Key Largo south around the Keys and Dry Tortugas and
north to Naples on the Gulf Coast. The area would extend 60 miles
west of Dry Tortugas.
   Three months of negotiations with Hodel and a January snorkeling
trip the men took together on the coral reefs off Key Largo
cemented the agreement, Martinez said. The Republican governor
denied that election year politics had any effect, but said Hodel
was aware of opposition from the Florida congressional delegation
and environmental groups.
   U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, a Democrat who built a reputation as a
defender of Florida's environment while preceeding Martinez in the
governor's mansion, noted that 130,000 people signed petitions
opposing oil drilling in the Keys of Florida, which has 2,200 miles
of coastline.
   ``This is the first time that (the federal government) have ever
deleted significant areas of a lease sale from a plan,'' said
Charles Lee, senior vice president of the Florida Audubon Society.
Legal challenges similar to Florida's have been brought by
Massachusetts, California and Alaska, with little result.
   Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth had a pragmatic
explanation for Martinez's negotiating success: ``I think most
people thought it was, at best, insane to explore for oil off the
Florida Keys.''
   Under the settlement, Martinez and Butterworth agreed to drop as
early as Monday the lawsuit against the plan, and the state also
will drop its challenge to leasing 41,000 acres to the seaward of a
protected area planned off Cape San Blas, in the Florida Panhandle.
In return, Interior will impose a one-year moratorium on
development of any leases that should be awarded there.
   That Panhandle area is believed to contain gas, not oil.
Martinez has reserved his rights to object to oil development if
any should be found off Cape San Blas.
   The Interior Department last year included the Florida Straits _
Atlantic Ocean waters off the Keys _ in a five-year plan for
developing the oil resources of the Outer Continental Shelf,
shallow waters extending 200 miles from the U.S. shoreline.
   An Interior Department study released last year concluded that
the cumulative danger from drilling, leaking tankers and other
sources added up to a 48 percent chance of a major oil spill along
Florida's coast within 35 years.

<HEAD>Personal Incomes, Consumer Spending Increased in February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' personal incomes rose at the
fastest clip in four months during February while consumer spending
was propelled upward by a rebound in car sales, the government
reported Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said personal incomes advanced 0.9
percent, reflecting strong employment gains in the past few months.
Spending rose 0.7 percent, up sharply from a tiny 0.1 percent
January increase.
   Economists said the new figures provided further evidence that
the economy has suffered no long-run effects from the October stock
market crash. Five months ago, analysts feared that consumer
worries about the future would cause them to cut back on spending
and could push the country into a recession.
   ``For people who were worried about a major consumer
retrenchment, these numbers are encouraging,'' said Sandra Shaber,
an economist with the Futures Group. ``As long as income gains hold
up, people will continue to spend.''
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch, said consumer
spending will rise by about 3.5 percent in the first quarter of
this year, after adjusting for inflation, a major rebound after a
spending decline in the final three months of last year.
   He said consumer spending would be the major factor contributing
to expected economic growth during the January-March quarter of
around 2 percent, as measured by the gross national product.
   A few months ago many analysts worried that growth in the
current quarter actually would be a negative figure, indicating the
country was headed into a new recession.
   Steinberg said the fear now was that consumer spending would
spurt ahead at such a fast pace that production bottlenecks could
occur and inflation would be rekindled. But Ms. Shaber said she did
not consider this a danger because she believed slower income
growth in the months ahead would slow the growth of spending as
well.
   Analysts said the February gain in incomes, which followed a 0.3
percent January rise and was the best showing since a 1.9 percent
October increase, reflected good employment news. The jobless rate
fell to an 8{ year low of 5.7 percent during the month.
   The key category of wages and salaries climbed by $15.4 billion
in February, a 0.7 percent increase which was the fastest advance
since November.
   Disposable income, the amount left over after taxes are paid,
climbed 1.1 percent in February, almost double the 0.6 percent
January increase. It was the best showing since a 2.1 percent rise
in October and was credited in part to tax cuts showing up as
employers held back less from paychecks.
   The individual tax cuts were the last round of reductions
scheduled under the landmark 1986 tax overhaul legislation.
   The 0.7 percent increase in personal consumption spending was
the biggest advance since a 0.8 percent rise in December. It
reflected a jump of $7.4 billion in sales of durable goods as
consumers responded to new incentive programs for autos. Durable
goods sales had fallen $2.4 billion in January.
   With incomes rising faster than spending, Americans' savings
rate climbed as well, rising to 5.2 percent of after-tax income
last month, the highest level since October.
   Purchases of non-durable goods _ items not expected to last
three years _ rose $2 billion in February after having fallen $7.7
billion in January. Purchases of services, including housing costs,
increased $12.4 billion following a $13.7 billion January increase.
   Farm incomes increased $8.5 billion in February after a decline
of $8.2 billion in Janaury. The big February gain and the large
January decline were both attributed to swings in government
subsidy payments to farmers.

<HEAD>Agreement Could Mean Post-Contra Era</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA </BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cease-fire agreement signed by the
Nicaraguan government and resistance forces appears to signify the
onset of the post-Contra era in Nicaragua and an entirely new
political dynamic in that country.
   The administration was officially upbeat about the agreement but
the Contras, with little prospect of receiving more U.S. military
aid, were forced to drop virtually all the concessions they had
been seeking earlier this year.
   The agreement clearly falls short of the administration goal of
an ``irreversible'' democratic process in Nicaragua as its price
for suspending aid to the Contras.
   Achievement of that objective is apparently dependent on
Sandinista good will coupled with whatever diplomatic and economic
pressures the industrialized democracies can muster to prod the
Nicaraguans in that direction.
   In theory at least, the Nicaraguan war could be revived if
upcoming talks break down. But the short-term prospect is for the
dismantling of the Contras accompanied by a number of gestures by
the Sandinistas, including a phased release of prisoners,
permission for political exiles to return, participation of Contra
representatives in a national dialogue and guarantees of free
expression.
   All of this was agreed to in the Sandinista-Contra cease-fire
talks this week. Still, the Contras have relatively little to show
for their six-year effort, particularly when compared with their
goals as recently as late January.
   At the time, they still were receiving U.S. military supplies
and were cautiously optimistic about the prospects for more aid
when that issue came to a congressional vote in early February. But
Contra aid foes prevailed on that vote.
   The Contras' settlement terms in late January called for the
implementation of 17 democratic reforms during a proposed 30-day
cease-fire period. They demanded gradual disarmament of both sides,
the repatriation of Soviet bloc military advisers, formation of a
single ``apolitical'' national army, suspension of compulsory
military service and the disbanding of the Sandinista militia.
   These demands received no attention at all or were dismissed
with no more than vague references in the communique signed
Wednesday night.
   Assuming that the Contras are dismantled, several questions
arise: Will President Daniel Ortega pursue with vigor the
communization of Nicaragua, as administration hardliners fear? Will
he strengthen his ties to the leftist insurgency in El Salvador?
Will he proceed with plans to acquire MiG jet fighters from the
Soviets? Will he build up the Nicaraguan armed forces to 600,000,
as his defense minister suggested? Will he move toward a uniquely
Nicaraguan system, which is neither modeled after Cuba nor his
democratic neighbor, Costa Rica? Or will there be a genuine
national reconciliation in Nicaragua, as Ortega suggests?
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz outlined in generally
positive terms the administration's reaction to the cease-fire
agreement, calling it an ``important step forward.''
   Other officials, asking not to be identified, said they
preferred not to offer their own assessments of the agreement even
on an anonymous basis because to do so would undercut Shultz.
   This suggests continued skepticism within the administration
about the terms the Contras agreed to and continued anger with the
Congress for letting the rebels down.
   Ever since the Central America peace agreement was signed last
Aug. 7, the administration had been steadily scaling back on its
expectations in Central America.
   Last fall, the administration was asking the Congress for $270
million in Contra aid. Faced with congressional opposition,
President Reagan lowered that figure to $36.2 million, with only 10
per cent of that earmarked for military aid.
   That proposal was defeated seven weeks ago and Congress mandated
an end to all aid deliveries by Feb. 29. Slightly more than three
weeks later, the Contras settled with the Sandinistas, accepting
terms that they would have rejected out of hand not long ago.

   Fifty-one illegal aliens smuggled into
the country from Mexico to sell frozen fruit bars and ice cream
from pushcarts were arrested and held for deportation Wednesday,
authorities said.
   The aliens, most of whom told authorities they had been brought
into the country in the last eight to 10 days, were sleeping on the
floor of the warehouse where the carts and products were stored,
said Ron Rogers, spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
   ``There were beer cans scattered all over the place, and pillows
and blankets on the floor,'' Rogers said. He said the men told
authorities they had been recruited in Mexico as street vendors.
   The operators of the vending company were being sought, he said.
   The aliens, one a teen-age boy and the rest adult males, were
being held for deportation hearings, he said.

<HEAD>EPA Orders Recall Of 1985 GM Cars And Light Trucks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half a million 1985 cars and light
trucks made by General Motors Corp. must be recalled because they
fail to meet federal air pollution standards, the Environmental
Protection Agency said Thursday.
   A faulty thermal vacuum switch is part of the reason the
vehicles' exhaust contains excess carbon monoxide and evaporated
gasoline, the EPA said.
   The vehicles affected by the recall are equipped with 5.0 liter
(305 cubic inches) and 5.7 liter (350 cubic inches) engines, the
EPA said.
   They were sold as the Chevrolet Impala, Caprice Classic, Camaro,
Monte Carlo and El Camino; the Pontiac Firebird, Bonneville, Grand
Prix and Parisienne; and the GMC Caballero, EPA said. Models sold
in California, which are built to stricter standards, are also
included.
   ``Earlier, we offered to recall the vehicles to replace the
thermostatic vacuum switch,'' said Jane Mott, GM spokeswoman in
Detroit. ``We will review the order and determine how best to
respond.''
   Such recall orders by the EPA are rare and generally indicate
the agency and a manufacturer could not agree on something, such as
the cause of the problem, its scope, the necessary repair, terms of
the recall or something else. Most recalls are made voluntarily.
   Ms. Mott said GM told the EPA it believed replacing the switch
on the vehicles would be sufficient to bring emissions into
compliance with federal standards.
   The EPA, however, said its tests showed that ``replacement of
the (switch) alone will not completely remedy the problem and that
additional repairs may be necessary.''
   GM has 45 days either to request a public hearing to contest the
order, or to submit a repair plan for EPA's approval before notices
are mailed to owners.
   The company last year recalled more than a million vehicles from
the 1982 and 1983 model years for similar problems.

<TEXT>
   The savings and loan industry, drained by
insolvent institutions in Texas, last year recorded its worst loss
since the Great Depression, the government said Thursday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said a $3.2 billion loss in the
last three months of 1987 pushed the industry's red ink for the
year to a record $6.8 billion.
   That was nearly 50 percent greater than the previous
post-Depression record of $4.6 billion, set in 1981, when the prime
lending rate soared above 20 percent.
   ``I hope it's the worst we'll ever see,'' said James W.
Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of Savings
Insitutions, the industry's largest trade group.
   The nation's 3,147 federally insured S&Ls lost $1.8 billion in
the third quarter of last year and $1.9 billion in the spring. They
earned $100 million in the first three months of the year and had a
modest $132 million profit for all of 1986.
   In contrast, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said earlier
this month that the nation's 13,700 federally insured commercial
banks earned $3.7 billion in 1987. Still, it was their lowest
profit since 1933.
   Despite the overall loss for the S&L industry, 66 percent of the
S&Ls earned money in the fourth quarter. The $1.3 billion earnings
of 2,089 S&Ls partly offset the $4.5 billion losses of the
remaining 1,058 institutions.
   For the year, the profitable two-thirds of the industry earned
$6.6 billion, which was more than wiped out by the $13.4 billion
deficit of the money-losing S&Ls.
   The percentage of institutions earning a profit has declined
steadily for two years, from 81 percent in the first quarter of
1986 to 66 percent at the end of last year.
   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, said S&L losses
were heavily concentrated in the Southwest, which is dependent on
the ailing oil and gas industry.
   Barth said the worst 20 institutions _ most of them in the
Southwest _ lost a total of $2.1 billion in the final quarter of
last year, accounting for two-thirds of the overall industry loss.
   An unprofitable instituion is not necessarily insolvent. An S&L
is considered insolvent when its loans and other assets are worth
less than what it owes to depositors and other creditors.
   The bank board said 345 S&Ls were insolvent at the end of 1987
under regulatory accounting principles, 109 of them in Texas alone.
There were 510 insolvent S&Ls under the stricter accounting
principles that will be used beginning next year.
   By another measure of health, return on assets, savings
institutions' performance was not quite as bad as 1981 and 1982.
The return was negative 0.56 percent last year, compared with
negative 0.73 percent in 1981 and minus 0.65 percent in 1982.
   Barth said some of the overall industry loss in 1987 can be
attributed to a decrease in the corporate tax rate. He said some
S&Ls decided to push profits into 1988, when the top tax rate is 34
percent, rather than take them in 1987, when the rate was 40
percent.
   Barth said he believed the industry's problems have ``plateaued
out'' and that ``there is some light at the end of the tunnel'' in
the Southwest.
   But Martin A. Regalia, chief economist of the National Council
of Savings Institutions, warned that most economists believe
interest rates will edge higher and said Southwest real estate
shows no sign of a sharp rebound.
   Regalia said the performance of the thrift industry this year
will depend on how quickly the bank board resolves problems at
Texas institutions.
   ``You have to be as expeditious as possible at getting them
closed down. So far I think (the bank board) has recognized the
problem. Now it's time to get out and do it,'' he said.
   Lack of money to pay depositors had forced the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures deposits to $100,000, to
keep many insolvent S&Ls open. Now that money is flowing into the
fund from a $10.8 billion recapitalization authorized by Congress
in August, the bank board is moving to close ailing institutions or
merge them with healthier S&Ls.
   Last month, the bank board announced a plan to spend $6 billion
to $7 billion in Texas over the next several years, but it doesn't
anticipate announcements on specific S&Ls before early April.

   Richard Gephardt could run for both the House
and the White House if he so chose _ at least temporarily.
   Under Missouri law, Gephardt could file for re-election by next
Tuesday's deadline and still remain in the presidential race at
least until May 17, the deadline for withdrawing from the state
primary ballot. If Gephardt withdrew by then and decided to
continue his presidential bid, filing for his congressional seat
would re-open for five days.
   Gephardt has another option, according to Cheri Ghan, a
spokeswoman for the Missouri secretary of state.
   He could file for re-election and would remain on the Aug. 2
Missouri state primary ballot even if he somehow managed to win a
spot on the Democratic presidential ticket in July.
   In that case, Gephardt would have a decision to make after the
state primary, if he won. Democratic officials would select the
congressional nominee if Gephardt gave up his congressional seat to
be part of the presidential ticket.

<HEAD>McFarlane Testifies in Meese-Iraqi Pipeline Grand Jury Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former national security adviser Robert C.
McFarlane testified for three hours Thursday before a federal grand
jury investigating Attorney General Edwin Meese III's ties to a $1
billion Iraqi oil pipeline.
   McFarlane, who declined to comment during a break in the grand
jury proceedings, became involved in the pipeline project in the
spring and summer of 1985 through contacts with Meese, longtime
Meese friend E. Robert Wallach and Wallach's client, Swiss oilman
Bruce Rappaport.
   McFarlane was accompanied to the federal courthouse by legal
counsel, Peter Morgan, who said his client is a witness in the
grand jury investigation.
   Independent counsel James McKay is investigating whether Meese
may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection
with the pipeline project.
   In a September 1985 memo to Meese relating Wallach's
conversations with Rappaport, Wallach said a portion of up to $700
million from the pipeline would be paid to the Israeli Labor Party
of then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
   Meese has said he doesn't recall reading the reference to Labor
Party payments in the memo, which was found in the attorney
general's files at the Justice Department last year in connection
with McKay's investigation.
   McKay is presenting evidence to the grand jury in an attempt to
determine whether there was a conspiracy to pay bribes to Israeli
politicians to ensure that Israel would not bomb the pipeline
passing through Iraq and Jordan close to the Israeli border.
Rappaport has denied making or offering bribes, and denies that
there was any plan to do so.
   Wallach went to Meese for help on the pipeline in May 1985 and
the attorney general referred him to McFarlane, who then was
President Reagan's national security adviser.
   The referral resulted in a meeting in June 1985 between
McFarlane, Wallach and Rappaport.
   The pipeline's backers wanted to enlist the support of the U.S.
government in assembling an insurance package that would protect
the project in the event of an Israeli attack.
   On March 11 in connection with the Iran-Contra arms and money
affair, McFarlane pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges that he
misled Congress in 1985 by assuring lawmakers the Reagan
administration was not helping arm Nicaraguan rebels during a ban
on U.S. military aid.

   Angry shouts erupted Thursday between 30
supporters of defendants in the Iran-Contra case and three
anti-Contra protesters outside the federal courthouse.
   An elderly woman ripped up signs calling Oliver L. North an
``American hero'' and shouted obscenities at demonstrators for
addressing her as ``old lady'' and ``communist.''
   Several police officers stood a few feet away but took no action.
   The woman, who identified herself as Lillian Geckter of New
Haven, Conn., boasted that inside the court building where North,
John M. Poindexter, Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim pleaded
innocent to a 23-count indictment, she looked North in the eye and
said: ``Don't you smile at me, traitor.''
   The pro-North demonstrators chanted, ``Ollie's right, Wright's
wrong,'' a slap at House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who led
defeat of Contra military aid in the House.
   ``Fund the Contras, not the lawyers,'' the group shouted as
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, the prosecutor, told
reporters he was pleased that U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell
intended to handle the case expeditiously.
   Walsh, who said he would not comment on the case now that it is
under Gesell's control, was booed by the protesters as he got into
his car.
   North emerged from a door far from the demonstrators, but his
car was mobbed by supporters and scores of reporters and
photographers as it passed slowly in front of the building where
the crowd had gathered. North smiled and waved from the back seat
but remained in the gray limousine.
   ``I think Ollie is getting a bum rap out of all this,'' said
Steve Bridgett of Greenville, Ill., who said he belonged to no
political organization.
   Peter Flaherty, chairman of Citizens for Reagan, said his and
several other groups were represented. ``We came to show our
friendship and support for Ollie and our solidarity with him,'' he
said.
   For a time during the arraignment, Aron Kay of New York City was
the lone anti-Contra demonstrator.
   After North passed by and Kay shouted, ``Ollie North's a liar,''
several pro-North demonstrators taunted him with, ``Why don't you
get a job?'' and several more caustic suggestions.
   Kay, who described himself as a long-time peace activist,
shouted back, ``Our job is protesting.''

Thursday after fellow Moslems decried its failure to heed
cease-fire calls in its war with Iraq and accused it of instigating
rioting in the holy city of Mecca.
   Iraq and Egypt said the withdrawal proved the ``loneliness'' of
Iran's stance toward the Islamic world.
   The Iranian envoy to the meeting of the Organization of Islamic
Conference, Mohammed Ali Taskhiri, flew out of Jordan at the head
of his five-man delegation.
   ``We were not happy,'' Taskhiri, his voice quavering with anger,
said in a telephone interview. He said his group boycotted meetings
Wednesday night and Thursday.
   ``The conference is taking place only to serve the interests of
a certain country,'' he said, referring to Iraq. ``Therefore, we
don't see why we should stay at this meeting.''
   Egypt and other Arab countries were drafting a resolution on the
Iran-Iraq conflict to submit to foreign ministers of the 46-member
conference.
   Sources close to the conference confirmed that the draft
denounces Iran's failure to heed last July's U.N. Security Council
resolution 598, which calls for a cease-fire in the 7{-year-old war.
   The sources, speaking on condition they not be identified
further, said the draft also criticizes Iran's purported leadership
of the violence in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and calls for future
``security measures'' to protect Moslem pilgrims.
   In a statement to the Jordanian government announcing its
withdrawl, the Iranian delegation specified it was unhappy with the
draft ``resolution on the gulf war...and the resolution on the holy
places.'' The text of the statement was provided by one of the
sources.
   The conference sources also said the draft of the final
communique, likely to be issued by Friday, also called for:
   _ An immediate Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan;
   _ Support for the 15-week-old Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip;
   _ Guaranteed rights for Moslem minorities in Bulgaria and other
countries where they might suffer persecution;
   _ Unspecified measures against air piracy.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said ``Iran's withdrawal
demonstrates its loneliness'' in the ranks of Moslem countries.
``They wanted to express their voice, or better, their lies, to the
organization, but they did not find ears.''
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid, whose country was
the target of Iranian criticism earlier in the conference, echoed
Aziz, saying: ``The voice of the Iranian representative is an odd
voice and it represents the loneliness in which Iran lives.''
   The Iranians attended the meeting after boycotting last year's
summit of Islamic heads of state in Kuwait, which Tehran accuses of
aiding Iraq's war effort.
   Iran, which is Persian and not Arab, sent a low-level delegation
to the Amman meeting. Taskhiri is head of the foreign relations
department in Iran's Islamic Guidance Ministry.
   Iran and Iraq have been blasting each other's cities for more
than three weeks with missiles and air raids, and the Iranians have
pushed into northeast Iraq.
   Iran was lambasted in Amman for allegedly inciting rioting last
year in Mecca in which 402 Moslems, 275 of them Iranian, were
killed.
   Saudi authorities said the pilgrims were killed in a stampede
triggered by Iranian rioters, and in subsequent violence. Iran
claimed police mowed them down with machine guns.
   The Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, said his
country will restrict the number of pilgrims to Mecca this year as
a ``temporary measure'' because facilities there needed to be
expanded. He did not elaborate.
   Iran has said it will send 150,000 people to this year's
pilgrimage.
   The Saudis reportedly have made it clear that Mecca and Medina,
Islam's holiest shrines, can accommodate only around 1 million
pilgrims at a time.

<HEAD>Gephardt Said Ready to Quit Race; Bush Riding Big Lead Into
Connecticut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT FURLOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Richard Gephardt, who has fallen on hard times since
his Iowa victory 45 days ago, will quit the presidential race
unless he scores an upset victory in Michigan this weekend, aides
said Thursday. George Bush, meanwhile, headed for Connecticut
expecting to pad his huge lead on the GOP side.
   Gephardt said he'd made no decision to drop out, declaring, ``My
mother always told me to cross one bridge at a time.'' But the
scramble was already on to pick up supporters who would be freed if
he withdrew.
   ``There's no question there are some union leaders who are now
supporting Dick Gephardt who would find Paul Simon the most
attractive of the alternatives,'' said Illinois Sen. Simon at an
appearance in Kalamazoo.
   Simon, who is in fourth place in the Democratic delegate count,
just ahead of Gephardt, spoke of getting ``back in the ballgame.''
   Among the Republicans, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, wife of Bush's main rival, Sen. Bob Dole, said in Oshkosh,
Wis., that her husband now has merely a ``long shot'' chance, but
she added, ``He's got the grit and determination needed to keep him
in the running.''
   She said neither she nor her husband have discussed the
possibility that one of them might be Bush's running mate for the
general election. ``I'm really not seeking to be on the ticket. I'm
going 12 hours a day just trying to carry Bob's message,'' she said.
   Vice President Bush, holding a commanding lead in the battle for
Republican convention delegates, was traveling to Connecticut,
saying he was taking nothing for granted in the primary there next
Tuesday.
   However, public opinion polls give him a big lead over Dole in
the state where Bush was born and where his father once served as a
U.S. senator.
   Gephardt, just a few weeks ago the victor in Iowa's caucuses,
now lags behind Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson, Albert Gore Jr. and
Simon in delegates to the national convention. He trails Dukakis
and Jackson in public opinion polls preceding Saturday's Michigan
caucuses.
   He said Thursday in Detroit, ``Rather than trying to guess all
the different hypotheticals of what might happen, I just think we
have to be patient, wait to see the outcome and then decide what
other steps should be taken.''
   Still, Gephardt's wife Jane told a radio interviewer in
Michigan, ``I think Dick has to come in first or a real strong
second to remain in the race. ... If we don't do well here, we will
not be able to continue.''
   The Missouri congressman has only until Tuesday to file for
re-election to his House seat, and one aide, commenting only on
condition he not be named, suggested that it was important for the
congressman to retain that office in order to raise money. His
campaign has been strapped for cash for weeks.
   Money was in the news for several other current and former
candidates on Thursday:
   _Gore said in Washington he was willing to release information
on more than $1 million in loans taken out by his presidential
campaign, but members of his staff who heard the senator's remarks
said no such decision had been made.
   Gore's pledge to release the material came after a report in a
Nashville, Tenn., newspaper that his campaign had put up the
proceeds of future fund-raisers and federal matching funds as
collateral for almost $1.5 million borrowed from banks about two
weeks ago.
   _The Federal Election Commission said that Gary Hart, now that
he is no longer a presidential candidate, can use leftover 1988
campaign funds toward retiring his lingering debt of about $1
million from his 1984 race.
   _The FEC agreed to grant federal matching funds to political
extremist Lyndon LaRouche's presidential campaign, even though he
is standing trial on a charge relating to alleged financial
irregularity in his 1984 campaign. LaRouche is running as a
Democrat, although the national party has disavowed his candidacy.
   The Democrats, including Gephardt, were concentrating on
Michigan and on Wisconsin, which has its primary on April 5.
   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis, who spent the first part of the week
trading charges with Gephardt on foreign-trade policy, a major
issue in a state heavily dependent on U.S. auto sales, was in
California but planned to spend all day Friday in Michigan. The
Detroit Free Press endorsed him on Thursday.
   Dole's aides said he had no campaign events scheduled Thursday,
and former television evangelist Pat Robertson was to address a
rally in Falls Church, Va., working to shore up his strength in his
home state.

   The Federal Election Commission on Thursday
declared fringe presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche eligible for
federal matching funds, even as a former aide was testifying
elsewhere of being pressured to wring donations out of people for
LaRouche's 1984 campaign.
   LaRouche is standing trial in Boston federal court on a charge
relating to alleged irregularity in his 1984 campaign.
   While the Federal Election Commission was certifying LaRouche to
receive federal funds for his 1988 campaign, former aide Charles
Tate testified at the trial that LaRouche solicitors were warned in
1984 that that falling short of daily fund-raising quotas was ``the
moral equivalent of treason'' and would result in the collapse of
Western civilization.
   The FEC, on a 5-1 vote, said that LaRouche has fulfilled the
requirements for eligibility to receive matching funds. But the
commission also said special review procedures would be undertaken
to evaluate each of his submissions for matching funds, in light of
irregularities found in his first submission.
   LaRouche spokeswoman Mary Jane Freeman said the ruling was
``terrific.'' She noted the campaign had ``no problem with the
conditions'' the FEC imposed.
   In voting with the majority, Commissioner Scott Thomas said,
``Presidential candidates and campaigns can come in many different
shapes and colors.''
   ``Overall it does look like there is substantial support for a
presidential campaign from American citizens for Mr. LaRouche,'' he
said noting that Larouche has raised more than $2 million from
contributors.
   But Commissioner Joan Aikens opposed the majority, saying an FEC
survey of LaRouche contributors raised ``a question of patent
irregularity'' in fund raising.
   A survey by the FEC's audit staff had indicated that 6 percent
of 713 LaRouche contributors contacted had not intended their
checks to go to his campaign.
   The survey was undertaken because some contributor checks had
the letters ``LDC,'' presumably for LaRouche Democratic Committee,
written over ``SDI'' as the payee. And some checks contained memo
notations regarding AIDS or SDI _ the first referring to the
disease and the second referring to President Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative _ suggesting the donors may not have intended to
give money to a presidential campaign, but to one of those causes.
   FEC auditors said many people who responded to the survey
``described instances where he@she 1. felt pressured into making a
contribution, 2. made contributions believing that the contribution
was for a specific purpose other than furthering Lyndon H. LaRouche
Jr.'s presidential nomination campaign, 3. made loans to the
campaign, and 4. had contributed to a number of LaRouche's
interests, while making all checks payable to LDC.''
   The auditors had recommended that LaRouche be found ineligible
for matching funds, but the FEC legal staff had said ``patent
irregularities indicated by the survey results do not justify an
unfavorable eligibility report.''
   Instead of the usual five-day approval period, a review period
of 25 days will be allowed in which the FEC staff will check for
irregularities in the checks he submits to be matched.
   In addition any checks written out simply to LDC, or those with
memo notations ``indicating lack of donative intent'' will not be
matched, the commission said.
   To be certified for matching funds, a candidate must raise
$100,000 across 20 states in individual contributions of $250 or
less. After becoming eligible, the candidates can receive matching
funds for each contribution of $250 or less that they raise
privately.
   LaRouche is on trial in Boston, charged with conspiracy to
obstruct a grand jury investigation into alleged credit card fraud
and other irregularities in his 1984 campaign.

<HEAD>Reagan Praises `Free-Market' Trend in Rewarding Teachers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Thursday lauded a trend
toward ``free-market principles'' in education that provide
incentives for teachers who achieve superior performance.
   Joining Education Secretary William J. Bennett in a visit to
Oakton High School just outside Washington, Reagan said recent
tours of this sort ``have strengthened my confidence in our
country's future.''
   But the president said much work still lies ahead if the nation
is to bring about the sort of educational reforms called for in a
1983 government report, ``A Nation at Risk.''
   The president said he expects a status report on American
education, which he is to receive next month from Bennett, to
``tell us what things we still must do'' as well as what progress
has been made.
   He also said that interest in teaching has increased in recent
years, partly because ``we've begun to introduce free-market
principles like incentivies and accountability to education.''
   He praised Fairfax County, in which Vienna is located, for
initiating a plan in which ``career ladders, performance-based pay
and other initiatives help to keep good teachers in the
profession.''
   But Reagan said no improvements in the caliber of instruction or
the quality of teachers will be helpful ``if a school has a drug
problem.''
   ``If students are using drugs, then no education reform can
work,'' the president told several hundred students and teachers in
the school auditorium.
   Reagan made several light-hearted references to his boyhood
school days, saying he wasn't a particularly good student, and
telling how he'd been called to the principal's office once. ``It
wasn't an invitation,'' he quipped.
   When a student asked Reagan whether he could attend the seniors'
high school graduation June 15, he smiled broadly and said he
didn't know if he could make it.
   ``Some people think I'm the most powerful man in the world,'' he
said, (but) ``every day they hand me a piece of paper that tells me
everything I'm going to be doing every 15 minutes.''

   A broken drawbridge that stranded
hundreds of motorists, some holding parties and others asleep in
their cars, was fixed just in time for Thursday's morning
rush-hour, police said.
   ``There are a lot of happy people out there,'' said Monroe
County Sheriff's Sgt. Lee Pinder.
   The Snake Creek Bridge reopened to traffic at 8:10 a.m. after
several gears jammed on the bridge Wednesday and locked it in the
upright position for more than 15 hours, snarling traffic for 30
miles on U.S. 1, the main highway from Miami to Key West.
   Every hotel room on both sides of the drawbridge at Plantation
Key was taken, and hundreds of people spent the night in their
cars. Police said motorists were remarkably patient.
   ``There were no arrests, no wrecks, no real problems,'' Pinder
said.
   One man who suffered a mild heart attack had to be ferried
across Snake Creek to an ambulance, Pinder said.
   A crane arrived from Key West at about 1 a.m. Thursday, and two
barges were brought in to aid state Department of Transportation
workers who fixed the bridge, said Monroe County Sgt. Scott
Cockrell.
   James Rocheleau, 25, and his friend George Kotval, 23, sat in
their car at the front of the line going north.
   ``You just have to roll with the punches,'' said Rocheleau, who
said he served with the Marines in Beirut, Lebanon. ``I got it
worse in the Marine Corps anyway. We'll just sit and wait.''
   Some Florida State University students on spring break had a
party at the Holiday Isle hotel.
   ``I had 10 rooms and I rented them all in about 10 minutes,''
said Alfrieda Bressler, night manager at the Chesapeake Motel in
Islamorada. ``It's not unusual for the bridge to get stuck, but
it's usually only for an hour or two. This is the worst I've ever
seen it.''
   In Florida City, the Highway Patrol set up a roadblock to turn
back southbound drivers.
   The Snake Creek Bridge is expected to remain closed to boat
traffic for two to three weeks, restricting boat traffic to those
small enough to move under the span, Pinder said.

<HEAD>Markey Plans To Draft Market Reforms Without Administration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House finance subcommittee
said Wednesday he will write legislation reforming the nation's
financial markets without waiting for the Reagan administration to
resolve disputes among warring regulatory agencies.
   ``For the investors of this country, justice delayed is justice
denied,'' said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.
   At a four-hour hearing of his House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on finance, Markey sharply criticized the creation of
an administration working group to coordinate recommendations on
what should be done to prevent a recurrence of the Oct. 19 stock
market crash.
   The panel, headed by Treasury Undersecretary George D. Gould,
has the job of trying to resolve a turf fight among the Federal
Reserve Board, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission over regulating the various financial
markets.
   President Reagan signed an order last Friday creating the panel
and gave it 60 days to report back to him. His spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater, warned that the issues ``may not be resolved quickly or
without considerable reflection.''
   Markey, however, complained that the recommendations delivered
in Janaury by a presidential task force headed by former New Jersey
Sen. Nicholas Brady should have been enough for the administration
to make up its mind.
   He complained that waiting two more months would make it
increasingly difficult to pass legislation this year, adding, ``In
my judgment Congress must act this year.''
   ``The greatest danger facing our financial system is the safe
course of delay,'' he said.
   Gould responded that his panel, which will include
representatives of the SEC, the Federal Reserve and the commodities
commission, is not conducting another study.
   ``We are anxious to create action from this, not simply more
discussion,'' he said.
   Markey said his committee, with the help of Brady, would proceed
on a ``parallel track'' without waiting for Gould's group to
formulate a position.
   Brady's commission called for giving the Federal Reserve the
power to coordinate regulation of the stock, options and futures
markets.
   The SEC, which regulates stocks and options, also wants
jurisdiction over stock futures, which currently are overseen by
the commodities commission. That agency opposes jurisdictional
changes, and the Fed has rejected taking on the additional
responsibility recommended by Brady.
   Markey has called for one regulator over stocks and stock
futures, but did not say which agency should get that power.
   Brady, who agreed to help Markey write his bill, said he did not
agree that the creation of the Gould group would unduly delay
action and said he did not see why Congress and the administration
could not work simultaneously.
   Meeting with reporters after the hearing, Brady moderated
earlier remarks on the urgency for reform.
   In a line that has become much quoted, Brady had compared the
markets to a gun and said, ``We are looking down the barrel of the
same gun, and it is still loaded.''
   But on Wednesday, he said, ``I didn't say anybody was going to
pull the trigger.''

   Congress and the Reagan administration warmly
welcomed a Nicaraguan cease-fire agreement Thursday, and some
officials said it could usher in a new era of bipartisan U.S.
policymaking on Central America.
   ``We consider this agreement to be an important step forward,''
said Secretary of State George Shultz, who added that the truce
leaves ``no excuse'' for continued Soviet-bloc weapons shipments to
the leftist Managua government.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the Nicaraguan agreement
marks ``a new chapter in the unhappy history of that war-torn
country'' and vowed to move ahead before Easter on a package of
humanitarian aid for the Contra rebels.
   ``This is a bad day for the cynics,'' said Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., a leading Contra opponent. ``A piece of paper has
been signed by people who many thought would never be able to sit
down face to face.''
   But the White House and some in Congress also said the accord,
while a strong sign of new health for the regional peace process,
rests heavily on promises of future moves by both sides that could
prove difficult.
   President Reagan, getting into his limousine after speaking to
high school students in suburban Vienna, Va., was asked whether he
thought the cease-fire agreement would hold up.
   ``I don't know. We're looking carefully at it,'' he replied.
   ``There is a lot of room for encouragement here, yes, but
there's also a lot of room for skepticism, and I'm trying to
balance those two off,'' said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   ``We're beginning the process. We need to watch it. We've seen
processes like this start before and fail,'' he said. ``This seems
like a more concrete step, and there certainly reason to be
hopeful. But I do not want to play down the skepticism side of it
either because we are skeptical.''
   Congressional leaders and the administration began conferring on
a new package of aid to the Contras on Wednesday, and more meetings
were scheduled for Monday. Wright said a vote could come later next
week and food, clothing and medicine could begin flowing to the
rebels by Easter.
   The cease-fire agreement reached Wednesday night in Sapoa,
Nicaragua, calls for ``exclusively humanitarian'' aid for the
rebels to be channeled through a ``neutral'' organization,
presumably the United Nations, the Red Cross, the Organization of
American States or some similar group.
   Wright said any aid package would have to conform to that
language, and Democratic leaders on the issue said that would rule
out provisions for future military aid to the rebels.
   But some Republicans insisted that any aid bill include
provision for a quick vote in Congress on new military aid if the
Sandinistas fail to live up to promises made in the cease-fire
agreement, including amnesty and the release of prisoners.
   ``I think it is important to keep in there some speeded-up
mechanism for the president and Congress to get together in case
the peace process fails,'' said Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash., a sponsor
of a Contra aid package that includes such a guaranteed vote.
   ``It's a recognition that there is still lots of skepticism,
maybe even suspicion, all the way around,'' Evans said. ``People
have been at each other's throats, and that's not going to
dissipate easily.''
   But of such suggestions, Wright said: ``I think it would be
counterproductive to talk about it ... We don't want to rekindle
the war.''
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said compromise on
language about future Contra aid was possible.
   ``We are willing to talk to the Republicans about anything, but
we are not willing to set up a process that the Nicaraguans could
interpret as allowing for more military aid,'' Coelho said.
   ``It looks like there may be a pretty good possibility of
Congress getting together on something the administration could
buy,'' Evans said.
   ``We haven't had a strong voice for American policy in Central
America in five years'' because of partisan divisions over the
administration's Contra policy,'' he said. ``We would finally be
sending a clear message.''
   ``For heaven's sake, if the Nicaraguans, who have been shooting
at each other, can agree, surely Republicans and Democrats can
agree,'' Wright said.
   The promises of quick action on a new aid package for the rebels
contrasted sharply with the inaction of recent weeks. The issue had
been stalled since the House narrowly defeated a $30 million
humanitarian aid package on March 3, and the rebels have been
without U.S. assistance since Feb. 29.
   Coelho said lawmakers had been intentionally moving slowly on
the issue since March 17, when Contra leaders called Wright's
office and said they were optimistic about achieving a cease-fire
in the talks that began Monday and asked that Congress hold back on
voting for new aid.

   The State Department's chief spokesman said on
Wednesday that Taiwan has been ``repeatedly'' reminded to stick to
a pledge against building nuclear weapons, but he declined to
comment on a report the United States pressured the Asian nation to
stop work on a plutonium processing plant.
   Taiwan halted work on the secret plant, which could have
processed plutonium, a key component of nuclear weapons, and shut
its largest civilian research reactor at U.S. insistence, The New
York Times reported.
   It was not clear whether the planned installation, which could
have extracted plutonium from spent reactor fuel, indicated a
decision to build a bomb or just an attempt to keep open a nuclear
option, according to unnamed officials quoted by newspaper.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman would neither
confirm nor deny the report, but he acknowledged that the United
States has expressed concerns to Taiwan about the proliferation of
nuclear weapons. And his comments suggested that if the United
States did indeed use pressure to stop the Taiwanese program, the
pressure worked.
   ``We've repeatedly conveyed the importance that the United
States, including both the administration and the Congress places
on Taiwan's adherence to its non-proliferation commitments, and we
are confident that Taiwan understands this,'' Redman said.
   ``It is our belief that Taiwan is not engaged in activities
which are inconsistent with its commitments,'' he said.
   He noted statements by Taiwanese leaders that they have no
intention of developing nuclear weapons. Also, Redman said that
Taiwan has undertaken obligations of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, in which countries agree to let international inspectors
monitor programs to make sure nuclear material is not being
diverted to use in weapons.
   ``All nuclear materials on Taiwan are subject to safeguards
applied by the International Atomic Energy Agency,'' Redman said.
``We are not aware of any violation of those safeguards.''
   According to officials quoted by the Times, the United States
learned of the project from Col. Chang Hsien-Yi, a top-level
informant at a Taiwanese research institute who left Taiwan a few
months ago with the help of the Central Intelligence Agency.
   Chang, deputy director of the nuclear energy research center at
the military-run Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, has
been missing since January.
   Taiwanese newspaper reports said he might have fled to the
United States with documents showing that Taiwan planned to make
nuclear weapons. His whereabouts is unknown.
   U.S. officials said the effort to build an installation capable
of plutonium extraction violated Taiwan's secret commitment to the
United States that it would not undertake research to develop
atomic weapons, the Times reported.

<HEAD>Major Maker of Ozone-Destroying CFCs Agrees To Stop Their
Manufacture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Du Pont Co., producer of one-quarter of
the chemicals destroying the Earth's ozone shield, plans to stop
making them because of new research showing decay of the ozone, the
company said Thursday.
   The company gave no deadline for ending manufacture of the
``fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons,'' or CFCs. These
non-toxic, non-flammable compounds that Du Pont helped develop in
the 1930s are widely used as refrigeration fluids, cleaning
solvents, plastic foam blowing agents and, outside the United
States, as aerosol propellants.
   ``I don't see it in the near term,'' not for five years, but at
the end of such a period policymakers and the chemical industry
should know ``how rapidly the transition can take place,'' Joe
Steed, environment manager in Du Pont's Freon Products division,
said in an interview.
   ``Our intention is to move as smoothly as possible from these
compounds into alternatives,'' Steed said.
   Du Pont announced in January it had developed a substitute foam
blowing agent. Also, Petroferm Inc. has announced a replacement
solvent for CFCs, and other chemicals are in the works at several
companies.
   On Thursday the company began notifying customers, competitors,
employees and members of Congress of its new policy.
   Environmentalists were quick with praise, hailing Du Pont's
``courage'' and ``leadership.''
   As recently as March 4, Du Pont said a proposal from three
senators that the company immediately stop making CFCs was
``unwarranted and counterproductive.'' The senators _ Robert
Stafford, R-Vt.; Max Baucus, D-Mont.; and David Durenberger,
R-Minn. _ had written Du Pont Chairman Richard E. Heckert calling
on him to redeem the company's mid-1970s pledge to end CFC
production if a threat to health were shown.
   A March 15 report of scientists convened by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration found a 2.3 percent decline in
ozone at mid-latitudes between 1969 and 1986, most probably the
result of CFC accumlations high in the atmosphere. That is
``important new information,'' Heckert wrote members of the
subcommittee on which the three senators serve.
   ``I hope it's clear that it's the science of last week we're
responding to,'' Steed said.
   Heckert's letter said the company believes ``the short-term risk
to health and the environment from CFCs is negligible'' but
``additional actions should be taken.''
   Ozone, a pollutant at ground level, at high altitudes blocks
ultraviolet rays of the sun that cause skin cancer. The
Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that a 1 percent
decrease in ozone thickness _ it would be only 3 millimeters thick
if it were at sea level _ causes a 2 percent to 3 percent increase
in ultraviolet and a 4.8 percent to 7.5 percent increase in the
most common skin cancers.
   Last fall in Montreal, major producers agreed on a treaty, now
signed by 31 nations but ratified only by the United States and
Mexico, agreeing to cut CFC production 20 percent in 1992 and
another 30 percent in 1998. The Environmental Defense Fund has
estimated that the two cuts could amount to only 35 percent instead
of 50 percent if all the exemptions are used.
   The treaty was accelerated, many experts acknowledge, by a 1985
finding that over Antarctica, ozone declines sharply each spring _
by 50 percent last year.
   Du Pont plans ``to urge all nations to treat the new scientific
information seriously, accelerate ratification of the Montreal
protocol, and then immediately initiate the protocol's assessment
process to consider further global limitations,'' Heckert's letter
said.
   Richard Barnett, chairman of the trade group Alliance for a
Responsible CFC Policy, said in a statement President Reagan should
``personally contact the heads of government'' of participating
countries asking that they ratify the Montreal agreement.
   ``This is a sterling example of corporate environmental
leadership that ought to be emulated worldwide,'' and shows that
``technology can solve environmental problems,'' in this case by
coming up with substitutes, said Dan Dudek, an economist with the
Environmental Defense Fund.
   About 2.3 billion pounds of CFC compounds are made worldwide
each year, with more than 2,000 Du Pont employees producing about
25 percent from plants in Canada, Japan, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico,
the Netherlands and the United States. The company says it gets
$600 million annually from CFC sales, about 2 percent of total
sales revenue.
   Steed said that ``Over the long term, it's our goal'' that jobs
making replacement compounds should offset lost CFC jobs.
   The U.S. plants are in Antioch, Calif.; Louisville, Ky.;
Montague, Mich.; Corpus Christi, Texas; and Deepwater, N.J.

<HEAD>US Belittles Soviet Technology For Spotting Nuclear Missiles On
Ships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States belittled Soviet technology
for detecting nuclear missiles aboard ships and snubbed an
invitation this week to see the process before the May 29-June 2
summit meeting in Moscow, a senior U.S. official said Thursday.
   During three days of pre-summit talks in Washington this week,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze offered to let the
United States participate in an experiment to test the system in
April.
   Shevardnadze hailed the system as a technological milestone in
missile detection that would help the superpowers achieve their
goal of a summit agreement to cut long-range nuclear arsenals.
   The senior U.S. official said, however, ``we're not interested''
because the system doesn't detect nuclear sea-launched cruise
missiles, as the Soviets claim.
   ``The Soviets could not explain how this experiment would tell
us more than we already know,'' the official said. ``Such
technology would not be effective under realistic conditions.''
   It could not, for example, tell the difference between nuclear
warheads and atomic propulsion systems used on many surface ships,
the official said.
   ``Our people know a great deal about the ideas that the Soviets
have advanced, and we've looked into it carefully,'' the official
said.
   When they agreed in principle last December to hold a springtime
summit in Moscow, President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev said they wanted to sign an agreement to cut the numbers
of long-range nuclear missiles and bombers by 30 percent to 50
percent.
   With little progress _ notably on the verification issues _
during Shevardnadze's visit to Washington for three days this week,
neither side predicted the agreement would be ready in time.
   The senior U.S. official said, moreover, that until the
negotiators prove they can verify elimination of the various types
of weapons involved, they won't know which ones will be covered in
a treaty.
   Another official, noting that the two nations also disagree on
such explosive issues as Afghanistan, the Middle East, Central
America and human rights warned against expecting ``easy
solutions'' to U.S.-Soviet problems.
   The official described the most recent talks as ``grueling,''
notably in the 11 hours of discussion on the regional hot spots.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater sought to dispel
suggestions that the summit meeting _ in the twilight of Reagan's
presidency _ would be a ceremonial and symbolic visit short on
substantive accomplishments.
   During Shevardnadze's talks in Washington ``we made enough
progress to keep going and presumably we will make more in the days
ahead,'' the spokesman told reporters.
   During the talks this week both sides ``faced all the tough
problems'' and left no confusion about where both sides stand, he
said.
   The summit ``will be well prepared; there will be substance to
discuss; there will be good prospects for success,'' Fitzwater said.
   He added that ``there will be a number of important and
substantive and meaningful issues to be resolved and all of those
things will occur at the Moscow summit. It meets all the criteria
that needs to be met.''
   ``I think this summit will be quite productive, well defined,
well prepared,'' the spokesman said without citing any specific
areas of agreement.

<HEAD>Iowa Quietly Continues Democratic Delegate Selection Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six weeks after the precinct caucuses
that put Iowa in the national spotlight and provided the first test
of Democratic candidates' strength, Democrats here are quietly
proceeding with the next step in their delegate-selection process.
   The conventions in the 99 counties this weekend are the second
step in the complex process of choosing 52 of Iowa's 58 delegates
to the Democratic National Convention.
   The field has shifted dramatically since Feb. 8, when the
much-publicized precinct caucuses were held. Rep. Richard Gephardt,
the Missouri congressman who won the Democratic contest, has gone
on to weak showings elsewhere.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore have surged to the front of the Democratic pack.
   Supporters who put Gephardt on top last month probably won't
flee his sagging candidacy for other Democratic candidates in
county conventions this weekend, Democratic leaders said Wednesday.
   Dukakis supporters are making a low-key effort to lure
supporters from other camps, but working hard to keep their
expectations low.
   ``It's informal,'' said Harry Baxter of Burlington. ``I'm sure
all of the campaigns are trying to lobby.''
   At the precinct caucuses, party activists elected delegates to
the county conventions, based on the proportion of support for the
various presidential candidates.
   At the county conventions, delegates will be elected to
congressional district conventions later in the spring.
   Despite Gephardt's slide, Baxter said Dukakis backers won't be
making a major effort to convince his delegates to switch at the
county conventions.
   Other activists agreed, saying backers of Gephardt and Illinois
Sen. Paul Simon, who finished second in the precinct caucuses, will
wait to see results in tests in Michigan and Wisconsin before
making a decision.
   Michigan is considered a last-ditch effort for Gephardt, and
that state's caucuses also are Saturday.
   As long as those candidates remain in the race, it's unlikely
their supporters will switch, and other campaigns are avoiding a
strident pitch soas not to offend potential future supporters.
   ``Our county chairs and the people we had in place for the
campaign are working, contacting supporters from other camps,''
said Dukakis backer Tom Jochum, a state representative from
Dubuque. ``If I were a Gephardt supporter, I'd be waiting to see
what the results are in Michigan.''
   Since Iowa's precinct caucuses, former Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt and Gary Hart have formally dropped from the race. Few
delegates are at stake there as Hart got less than 1 percent while
Babbitt got 6 percent in the caucuses.
   ``People are going to wait to see what happens,'' said Iowa
Democratic Party spokesman Phil Roeder. ``The only people who are
going to move are the Babbitt people. The Gephardt people are going
to wait.''
   Caucus-goers selected 15,000 delegates to the county conventions
and 30,000 alternates. They will elect 3,001 delegates to the six
congressional district conventions May 14. Those delegates will
pick 52 of the state's 58 national delegates.
   The state has six ``super'' delegates, who are elected officials
and party leaders.

<HEAD>Moscow Uses New Plan, Helicopters to Combat Armenian Annexation
Drive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

   The Kremlin laid out an 8-year plan Thursday night
to pacify a Caucasus region shaken by ethnic strife. At the same
time, army helicopters were reported circling over the Armenian
capital to prevent further unrest.
   The carrot-and-stick approach seemed aimed at cooling feelings
inflamed by a noisy Armenian campaign to annex the region of
Nagorno-Karabakh from neighboring Azerbaijan and to warn Armenian
activists to end their protests.
   Activists have said specifically that government efforts to
improve poor economic and social conditions of Armenians in the
Caucasus mountain region near the Soviet border with Iran would not
meet their demands.
   Armenian newspaper editor Regyen Sarkisyan said Yerevan, capital
of Armenia and scene of mass pro-annexation demonstrations in
February, was being patrolled by Red Army helicopters and soldiers.
He said no violence was reported.
   Sarkisyan told The Associated Press in a telephone interview
that most Armenians were showing patience in awaiting resolution of
the issue.
   On Feb. 28, rioting broke out in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, and
officials said 32 people were killed.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, which is smaller than Delaware, has a
population that is 75 percent Armenian but has been a part of
Azerbaijan since 1923.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's highest
government body, rejected as ``intolerable'' Wednesday the campaign
for annexation of the region, indicating it would not bend to
pressure from mass protests.
   The Presidium, meanwhile, ordered ministries to solve ``pressing
problems of the economic, social and cultural development'' of the
region. The ruling Communist Party Politburo made public details of
their proposals Thursday.
   The plan for 1988-95 calls for stepping up the pace of
construction of schools, hospitals, apartments and roads in the
region and for increasing the publication of Armenian literature.
   ``Work will also be completed to ensure a steady reception of
the national television program, as well as ... telecasts of
Armenian and Azerbaijani television,'' the officia Tass news agency
said in a report on the Politburo meeting.
   The plan calls for increasing by 50 percent the industrial
output of the region.
   The plan approved by the Politburo was formulated by the Central
Committee, the Communist Party's policy-making body, and the
government Council of Ministers, Tass said.
   It said the Politburo deemed it ``essential to resolutely
discourage the slightest manifestations of nationalism or
disrespect for national sentiments of members of various ethnic
groups.''
   Last week, a prominent Soviet journalist writing in the Moscow
News weekly said residents of Nagorno-Karabakh suffer cultural and
economic disadvantages.
   Karen Khachaturov said people there have difficulty getting
books in their native language and officials have not made good on
pledges to build a sports complex and children's institutions.
   Moscow dissident Valery Senderov said Thursday that a
correspondent for an unofficial human rights journal called from
Yerevan to say Soviet army helicopters were patrolling the city,
but no widespread disorder was reported.
   Sarkisyan, a senior editor of the Armenian Communist Party
newspaper Kommunist, confirmed the helicopter report and added that
soldiers were deployed around Yerevan to ensure order.
   Activists in Yerevan had called for another show of support for
the annexation drive with demonstrations and strikes beginning
Saturday, when a group of activists and officials plans to meet to
discuss a future course of action.
   Sarkisyan says it is his personal belief that Nagorno-Karabakh
should be united with Armenia. He said he does not expect a large
turnout at the demonstrations or widespread participation in the
strikes called for by activists.
   Moscow-based dissidents say they've been told thousands plan to
take to the streets.
   The Presidium did not directly address the question of
annexation. Last month's mass protests in Yerevan subsided after
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed on Feb. 26 for calm and
promised a party review of the annexation question.
   Demonstrations were held again in Yerevan this week after a
report in the Communist Party daily Pravda said the annexation
drive had a ``clear anti-socialist spirit.'' Activists said 7,000
people took part in a protest march Monday.

<HEAD>Former Israeli Nuclear Worker Convicted Of Treason, Spying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former nuclear technician who claimed he
revealed Israel's atomic secrets for the good of humanity was
convicted Thursday of espionage and treason and could be sentenced
to 20 years in prison.
   Mordechai Vanunu, 34, was found guilty by a three-judge panel
after a trial that had been closed to the public since it began in
September. His lawyer said the Vanunu would appeal the verdict to
Israel's Supreme Court.
   ``Mordechai is very disappointed,'' said defense attorney
Avigdor Feldman. ``The court decided that he was a traitor, and he
had hoped to be seen differently. But he is not broken. He is
looking ahead to the appeal.''
   The conviction carries a maximum sentence of death. However,
prosecutor Uzi Chasson said he would ask the court for a sentence
of life imprisonment, which in Israel is limited to 20 years.
Sentencing is set for Sunday.
   Vanunu, who worked nine years at the nuclear facility in Dimona,
was charged for revealing details of Israel's atomic capacity to
The Sunday Times of London in October 1986.
   The newspaper said Vanunu's information showed Israel had
stockpiled the world's sixth-largest nuclear arsenal.
   Israel never has responded directly to allegations of its
nuclear capacity, saying only it would not be the first country to
introduce such weapons into the Middle East.
   Vanunu has insisted he made his revelations to alert the Middle
East and the world to the dangers of nuclear weapons. The state
argued he intended to harm Israel's security.
   He was kept under heavy security during the trial, which was
closed to the public because authorities feared an open hearing
would harm state security.
   Vanunu has been held in near isolation for the last 18 months
and has been permitted to see only his attorney and family.
   The precautions were taken after Vanunu managed to flash a
message to reporters at a pre-trial appearance by scribbling it on
the palm of his hand. In the message he said he had been kidnapped
in Rome, presumably by Israeli agents, and brought to Israel for
trial.
   Vanunu was fired from the Dimona nuclear center in 1985 and went
to Australia, where he became acquainted with a priest and
converted to Christianity.
   He later traveled to London, but disappeared in October 1986,
just days before The Sunday Times published his revelations.
Israeli officials acknowledged several weeks later he was in
custody in Israel.
   Details of Vanunu's journey back to Israel were revealed by his
brother, Meir Vanunu, who said Vanunu was lured from London to Rome
by an American woman named Cindy, who promised him sex. In Rome, he
was abducted by Israeli agents and spirited home, Meir said.
   During the trial, Feldman argued Vanunu did not hurt Israel's
security because information about Israel's nuclear capacity was
available in the academic world. He said Vanunu had in fact helped
state security because allegations of Israel's nuclear strength
served as a deterrent to Arab enemies.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Senate Bill To Protect Historic Shipwrecks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation pushed by archaeologists to save
historic shipwrecks won House committee approval Wednesday despite
complaints from recreational divers that the bill could block their
enjoyment of the undersea landmarks.
   The bill is designed to clear up the murky legal status of
shipwreck jurisdiction by giving states authority over certain
downed vessels in state waters, preventing salvage operators from
destroying historic remains.
   The House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee put aside a
House version of the measure and passed 29-10, largely along party
lines, a bill sponsored by Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., that the
Senate passed in December.
   Democrats led by Rep. Charles E. Bennett, D-Fla., who has
advocated a shipwreck preservation law for a decade, said they
agreed with an amendment proposed by Rep. Norman D. Shumway,
R-Calif., mandating that states make shipwrecks accessible to
divers.
   But Bennett and others noted that an amended bill would need
Senate approval again, and they were afraid the measure would die
there as it has in past years. This is the first time the Senate
has approved a shipwreck bill.
   ``Don't kill this bill by making it perfect,'' Bennett urged.
``I'm afraid it's going to be a better corpse.''
   Shumway, pointing to vocal opposition from sport diving groups,
said the legislation should spell out guarantees for divers.
   ``I think this bill can be vastly improved,'' he said.
   Bennett retorted that ``if you don't pass this bill, there won't
be any shipwrecks to dive on.'' Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I.,
who said she is a recreational diver, agreed, joining Democrats in
defeating the Shumway amendment 25-14.
   Bennett said later that he expected easy passage on the House
floor. The Reagan administration supports the measure.
   The committee agreed to place in a report that accompanies the
bill language stating that it is the intent of Congress for states
to make shipwrecks accessible to divers.
   Under the legislation, states would have jurisdiction over
historic shipwrecks within their three-mile state limits. They
would be charged with establishing protective areas, allowing
recreational exploration and overseeing public and private salvage
efforts.
   Under admiralty laws, discoverers of wrecks can salvage
abandoned vessels. Those laws are at odds with many state statutes.

   For 58 hours after a toddler tumbled into
an abandoned well, hundreds of rescuers worked together to free
her, but now an effort to bring their heroism to television has
divided them.
   Two groups _ one mostly volunteer rescuers and the other city
officials _ are negotiating separately with different TV producers
for a movie of the story that captured the nation's attention as it
unfolded live on television.
   Both groups are awaiting the endorsement of Chip and Cissy
McClure, whose 23-month-old daughter Jessica became stuck in a
22-foot-deep well for 58 hours in October.
   One volunteer rescuer, Bruce Peeler, said he is remaining
neutral in the dispute. But he said he wonders whether the story
could be told properly in any case.
   ``I am wondering if a unified group got together ... if a really
true, accurate picture of what took place could ever be put on the
screen,'' said Peeler, president of Midland's Airmaster Equipment
Corp., which contributed drilling materials for the rescue.
   The effort brought praise and a spotlight to Midland, an oil
town of 97,400 people in western Texas.
   ``It was a special event. There was so much effort, and everyone
had their own story. Maybe it should be kept special like that,''
he said Thursday.
   The Jessica McClure Rescuer's Association, a group of about 30
volunteers, is committed to a movie deal with Los Angeles producer
Larry Spivey, president of Highland Communications Group Inc. The
group has asked all rescuers to join them.
   The association's president, Kragg Robinson, said 33 members
have signed a contract that includes an initial $200,000, plus
future payments, to be divided among the membership.
   The other group, the McClure Rescue Association, has narrowed
its selection to an unidentified producer but has not signed any
commitments. The association, comprising 11 municipal officials
including Police Chief Richard Czech, Fire Chief James Roberts and
paramedic Robert O'Donnell, wants nothing to do with Spivey.
   ``We found that he was going around to individual members of our
association offering each member side deals that the others didn't
know about,'' said Martin Allday, a lawyer representing the group.
   Spivey says everyone was offered the same deal _ a chance to
consult in the production or to act in it.
   Either group or neither group could end up actually making a
film. Spivey still needs a commitment from a network for his
project.
   ``My advice to anyone is if they have not signed with the
producer to not do so until the McClures say who they want the
movie to be made by,'' said Allday.
   The McClures have said they don't want to profit by their
daughter's story, but do not want to stand in the way of the story
being told.
   Peeler said Thursday he is concerned that the group of municipal
workers will not allow others to help negotiate a movie deal.
   He said he and other neutral volunteers are working to bring the
groups together ``so that the same type of unity and spirit as
depicted last October can return.''
   ``I'm sad about this problem,'' he said. ``My concern is that
there were several hundred people out there and it is not right
that maybe the lady that brought us hamburgers at three in the
morning, or the guy who brought the sanitary privvies down _ how do
you say they should not be in the movie, too?''

   Israeli jets bombed Palestinian targets on
the outskirts of Sidon on Thursday for the second straight day,
hitting a base of the notorious Abu Nidal guerrilla faction.
   Police said nine people were killed and five wounded in the
raid, the third this week near the port city 25 miles south of
Beirut.
   Police said most of the casualties were members of Abu Nidal's
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, and the group issued a statement
pledging ``merciless retaliation.''
   A police spokesman described the attack as ``very fierce.'' He
said six Israeli warplanes dropped 30 bombs in six sorties within
55 minutes.
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss instructed Lebanon's U.N. ambassador,
Rashid Fakhoury, to complain to the world body about the attacks,
state radio said.
   But Lebanon did not ask for a Security Council meeting on the
issue, it said.
   The police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in
keeping with standing regulations, said the main target was Abu
Nidal's guerrilla base, but the jets also hit a position of the
Marxist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   ``The Israelis plowed the olive groves where the stricken bases
are,'' he added.
   The bases were engulfed by smoke and dust as ambulances arrived
to evacuate casualties.
   The police spokesman said Abu Nidal's guerrillas cordoned off
the bases in the villages of Bekasta, Majdelyoun, Salhiyeh and Abra
on the southern and eastern edges of Sidon.
   The jets dropped scarlet balloons to deflect heat-seeking
missiles. The guerrillas fired at the roaring jets with Soviet-made
anti-aircraft guns. No hits were reported.
   ``Let the enemy wait for coming blows of our revolutionary
fighters,'' said a statement issued by the Fatah-Revolutionary
Council. ``We shall strike doubly in merciless retaliation.''
   Abu Nidal _ real name Sabri al-Banna _ broke from Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974. He has since
claimed attacks against a series of civilian targets around the
world.
   The elusive terrorist mastermind tops wanted lists in the United
States and Europe. His whereabouts are not known, altough recent
reports said he has been shuttling between Libya and Algeria.
   His group also vowed revenge after Wednesday's strike, saying in
a statement it would ``severely strike back against the Zionist
enemy's arrogance and barbarism ... at the right time and place.''
   Wednesday's attack targeted bases of the Abu Nidal and the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a PLO faction
headed by Nayef Hawatmeh. Police said eight people were killed and
15 wounded in the attacks.
   In all, 48 people have been killed and 63 wounded in five
Israeli air raids this year, by Lebanese police count.

   Clutching a feline named Pole Cat, Mellissa
L. Sanders climbed into the bucket of a hook-and-ladder fire truck
and returned to earth Thursday after a record 517 days sitting atop
a 43-foot pole.
   ``My knees are wobbly but I feel great,'' said Miss Sanders, who
was embraced by her mother, Mauri Rose Sanders. ``Without the cat,
I would never have made it.''
   Miss Sanders, 19, broke the world record Feb. 25 when she
overtook the 488-day mark set by Mark Sutton of Victoria, British
Columbia. She now is in the Guinness World Book of Records.
   Her fiance, Keith Seal, 25, of Monterey, Calif., greeted her on
the ground. They met after Seal read an article about her effort to
raise money for cancer research and telephoned her. They announced
their engagement in August, before meeting.
   ``I've been waiting a year for this,'' he said.
   About 1,000 people gathered to watch Miss Sanders' descent from
the shack she called home for 1{ years. Some handed her bouquets,
others made contributions for her cancer fund-raising efforts.
   ``All this doesn't seem real,'' said Miss Sanders' mother, who
herself set a record of 211 days atop a pole in 1959. ``We want her
back with us, but honestly it seems like only yesterday that she
went up there.''
   Miss Sanders said her first activity would be to ``drive around
town, then take a good long walk.''
   She had said she was proud to have raised $10,000 for cancer
research but had hoped to climb down with $100,000. Miss Sanders'
sister, Rebecca, has cancer and has been in remission for four
years.
   ``I'm sure she'll look back on this with fond memories,'' said
Miss Sanders' aunt Tanya Bowls. ``Maybe she saved a life by doing
this. And that's about all you can ask for.''
   Firefighters were on hand to make sure Miss Sanders made it
safely to the ground from the three-story shack.
   ``She's going to look up and be lonely when she passes by here
next,'' said Perry Township Fire Chief David Betzner. ``It's been
her home and when you take someone out of their home _ no matter
how much they want to go _ they're going to look back with
longing.''
   Miss Sanders' 6-by-7-by-9-foot shack was equipped with a plastic
kiddie pool, television and a telephone that resulted in regular
$300 phone bills. For company she had her cat, Pole Cat.
   Before coming down, Miss Sanders admitted, ``There were some
real sad times, times that were real hard.''
   ``But I always knew I would make it, even when I was scared or
going through hard times,'' said the Tucson, Ariz., native, who
rode out 70 mph winds during a major snowstorm in February.
   Seal first contacted Miss Sanders in November 1986. They
communicated, but did not meet face-to-face until November 1987.
   ``Now that she's getting down we have to start dating,'' said
Seal. ``I mean we're already engaged and we haven't even gone on a
date.''

<HEAD>Embassy Demonstration for Soviet Jews Tests New Supreme Court
Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of Soviet Jews tested a new Supreme
Court ruling Wednesday that knocked down rules banning peaceful
demonstrations within 500 feet of foreign embassies in Washington.
   The dozen demonstrators, accompanied for a time by Sens. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., gave speeches on
the sidewalk in front of the Soviet Embassy. Then seven of them sat
down on the sidewalk, prayed and sang. Some taunted Soviet
officials as they moved freely in and out of the embassy gate.
   The police, whose numbers rivaled those of the demonstrators,
did nothing to impede the protest. They quietly ensured that the
driveway and embassy gate remained clear and they steered
pedestrians through the maze of protesters and the accompanying
phalanx of reporters and photographers. Police made no move to
arrest anyone.
   In fact, they stopped traffic on busy 16th Street so the
demonstrators could move back and forth to the embassy.
   ``They can't block the driveway,'' said Sgt. Gary Nelson of the
District of Columbia police. ``They can't block free passage of the
sidewalk.''
   Rabbi Avi Weiss of New York, the chairman of the Student
Struggle for Soviet Jewry, was a leader of Wednesday's
demonstration. He has been arrested several times for violating the
limits on protests near the Soviet Embassy.
   ``There are those who say the (Supreme Court) ruling takes away
the dramatic tool of arrest,'' Weiss said before the demonstration
began. But he warned, ``If the necessity arises that we'll have to
sit peacefully in front of the gates, then that's something I'd be
willing to do.''
   In Tuesday's Supreme Court ruling, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
writing for the court, said police may disperse groups of three or
more congregating near embassies when they ``reasonably believe
that a threat to the security or peace of the embassy is present.''
Banning such gatherings ``does not prohibit peaceful
congregations,'' she wrote, adding that the ban ``is limited to
groups posing a security threat.''
   Weiss said the court's ruling ``allows a far greater voice for
Soviet Jews specifically at a time when so many have been duped by
`glasnost.''' Glasnost is the Russian word for ``openness.''
   He condemned an upcoming trip by Commerce Secretary C. William
Verity and some 500 business executives to the Soviet Union.
   ``There cannot be an increase of trade, an increase of loans
without a concession on human rights on the other side,'' Weiss
said.
   As the demonstration commenced in front of the embassy, a dozen
Soviet officials sat in the patio on the other side of the gates,
enjoying the suddenly springlike weather, chatting amongst
themselves and occasionally gazing at the demonstrators.
   As the protestors sang at one point, a Soviet official walked
into the front gate, barely suppressing a smile.

<HEAD>Motorola To Pay $16.7 Million In Fines For Navy Mischarges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc.'s electronics group has agreed
to pay the government $16.7 million and to plead guilty to a
criminal information accusing it of mischarging for labor and
materials on Navy satellite and missile contracts, the Justice
Department announced Thursday.
   In documents filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, Motorola's
Government Electronics Group in Scottsdale, Ariz., was accused of
inflating costs for a component of a Navy satellite communications
and mischarging $2.5 million in labor, materials and other costs.
The money actually was spent on other work, the government said.
   The Defense Department, relying on the inflated amounts, paid
some $5 million more than it should have on a second contract for
the satellite communications system, said the government.
   Motorola, one of the nation's top 50 defense contractors, agreed
to plead guilty to three counts of making false statements.
   The firm said in a statement from Motorola headquarters in
Schaumburg, Ill., that ``it is now clear in retrospect'' that the
electronics group's ``systems were not adequate to ensure total
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.''
   ``The conduct of the employees involved in these programs failed
to conform to Motorola's own internal standards,'' the statement
added. The electronics group ``has greatly expanded its compliance
efforts'' with reforms which ``are now an integral part of the way
GEG does business.''
   Under the agreement, which still must be approved by a court,
the government has agreed not to prosecute the company further on
the contracts, but reserves the right to prosecute individuals.
   The court documents also say the firm mischarged labor costs for
work on 10 contracts involving production of target detecting
devices for the Navy's Standard missile.
   The third count in the criminal information said Motorola
mischarged labor costs on a contract for the production of
targeting detecting devices for the Navy's Phoenix missile.
   Motorola will pay $16.7 million in criminal fines, restitution
and civil penalties. The company already has paid $6.8 million to
the Defense Department.
   The pleas result from an investigation into labor and materials
charging and pricing practices by Motorola from 1979 to 1984.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Parts of the Northeast basked in record warmth Tuesday, with
temperatures in the 60s and 70s, while showers and thunderstorms
dampened the north-central states.
   The showers reached from southern Michigan across northern Iowa,
northeast Nebraska, eastern South Dakota and Minnesota. Rain also
fell from the lower Great Lakes across east-central New York and
along the northern Pacific Coast.
   Advisories warned of snow and blowing snow across the northern
mountains of Colorado. Winds gusted to 55 mph at Pueblo, Colo., and
58 mph at Cheyenne, Wyo.
   Balmy weather held sway across sections of the Northeast. Record
highs included 66 at Bridgeport, Conn., 72 at Newark, N.J., 75 at
New York, and 76 in Philadelphia.
   By contrast, Klamath Falls, Ore., had a record low temperature
of 19 degrees.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 0.77 inch at Boothville, La., 0.60 inch at Quillayute,
Wash., 0.55 inch at Astoria, Ore., and 0.47 inch at Minot, N.D.
   Temperatures at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 26 degrees at
Yellowstone, Wyo., to 90 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif. The
morning low was 4 degrees at Yellowstone.
   Friday's forecast called for rain along the northern Pacific
Coast; snow scattered over northeast Minnesota, becoming rain over
the remainder of eastern Minnesota, Wisconsin and upper Michigan as
well as from New York across central and southern New England, and
showers and occasional thunderstorms from northeast Illinois across
lower Michigan, the Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley, and the
central Gulf Coast.
   Temperatures were expected to climb into the 30s and 40s in
northern New England, Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, the upper
Mississippi Valley, the northern Plains and the upper Missouri
Valley; into the 70s from the central Atlantic Coast across
Georgia, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, the central Gulf Coast,
much of Texas, and northern California, into the 80s over the
Florida Peninsula, and southern Texas; into the 80s to low 90s
across southern California and the desert Southwest, and the 50s
and 60s elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   The guns were silent Thursday, the
first day of an agreement between the government and Contra rebels
that Nicaraguans pray will bring peace for the first time since
1981. One man called it a miracle.
   During three days of negotiations that resulted in agreement
Wednesday night, both sides had said it was the last chance for
peace in Nicaragua. The formal, 60-day cease-fire is to begin April
1, but they agreed to extend a truce declared for the talks.
   Virgilio Godoy, president of the opposition Independent Liberal
Party, said Thursday: ``I believe that the agreement is a hope. ..
. It is not a question of saying now who won and who lost in the
agreement, but that Nicaragua and thousands of mothers who have
sons in the war won.''
   Alonso Moreno, who owns a shoe store and has three nephews in
the army, said: ``This is the most important thing that has
occcured since 1979 when the Somoza dictatorship was overthrown.''
   In a broadcast Thursday, the rebel Radio Liberacion said, ``The
(Nicaraguan) Resistance has taken an initial step to end the
hostilities in Nicaragua, a very significant step.''
   El Nuevo Diario, a pro-government newspaper, asked a question in
its banner headline: ``Cease Fire! Peace Explodes?''
   Enrique Bolanos, president of the private enterprise council and
staunch government critic, called the pact ``a miracle,'' and
added: ``Perhaps the Sandinista Front will finally comply with its
word.''
   During the negotiations at Sapoa, on the Costa Rican border 90
miles south of Managua, President Daniel Ortega made a suprise
visit and said it was time ``to bury once and for all the military
confrontation.''
   Rebel leader Alfredo Cesar told journalists at the meeting: ``It
is not just a chance to achieve peace and harmony, but the only
chance.''
   Leaders of the Sandinistas and the U.S.-sponsored Contras stood
side-by-side on a makeshift dais Wednesday night in Sapoa, sang the
national anthem together and signed the cease-fire.
   During the three days, both sides retreated from hard positions,
especially the Sandinistas, who stand to gain the most from an
agreement that would virtually end the insurgency.
   The Contras agreed not to accept military aid and to receive
non-lethal supplies exclusively from neutral organizations. The
Reagan administration, which has financed the rebels since they
began fighting in late 1981, has been seeking congressional
approval of more funds.
   Provisions of the agreement meet requirements of the regional
peace plan signed Aug. 7 by all five Central American presidents _
ending the fighting, granting political amnesty and restoring
democratic freedoms.
   Opponents of the Sandinistas say they promised democracy when
overthrew rightist President Anastasio Somoza in July 1979, but
instead established a Marxist regime.
   Although the cease-fire does not begin officially until April 1,
both sides said they would continue the battlefield truce they
declared on Monday, the first day of negotiations.
   Beginning Monday, also in Sapoa, negotiators will draw the lines
of areas to which rebels will go during the first two weeks of the
official cease-fire.
   Nothing is said in the agreement about the Contras laying down
their weapons, so that may be another subject taken up in next
week's meetings. In past negotiations, the rebels insisted on
keeping their weapons until provisions of any accord were carried
out.
   Also not mentioned is a reduction of the 80,000-member regular
armed forces, largest in Central America. The government claims to
have 300,000 people under arms, including army, reserves and
civilian militia.
   Gradual amnesty is provided for Nicaragua's 3,300 political
prisoners, beginning Sunday. The deal also guarantees
``unrestricted freedom of expression,'' demanded by the rebels, and
permits all exiles to return home.
   With verification that the Contras have moved into the truce
zones, they can send up to eight delegates to participate in
national talks now under way in Nicaragua as part of the regional
peace plan, the agreement says.
   The Sandinistas agreed that the ``issues related to military
service will be dealt with.'' Contra negotiators had insisted
forced military service be ended.
   Ortega's government granted a rebel request that compliance with
the agreement be verified by a commission formed by Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo and the secretary-general of the Organization of
American States, Joao Baena Soares.
   Both were witnesses to the talks and it was Baena Soares who
read the final document aloud. Obando y Bravo had mediated previous
negotiations outside the coutnry.

   Richard Gephardt, pressing on with his hard-line
trade stance, on Thursday denied statements from aides that he
would shut down his campaign for the 1988 Democratic presidential
nomination if he does not win Saturday's Michigan caucuses.
   Amid turmoil over reports that Michigan was a do-or-die state
for him, Gephardt delivered a speech here and denounced a
``dogmatic and outdated'' free trade theology that has cost the
nation jobs.
   Gephardt brushed aside questions about the future of his
campaign, but aides spoke privately of a decision hinging on the
Michigan caucus outcome.
   Plans are in motion for the Missouri congressman to file for
re-election to his House seat by the Tuesday deadline, said the
aides, if Michigan does not give him his first victory since the
South Dakota primary on Feb. 23.
   ``That's right. He will be out if doesn't win in Michigan,''
said a campaign aide who would not be quoted by name.
   Asked if that aide's comment was accurate, Gephardt told
reporters:
   ``No. I'm running for president and I've doing very well here in
Michigan. ... I'm going to win in Michigan. I'm going to continue
and do well.''
   ``My mother always told me to cross one bridge at a time. That's
what I'm trying to do,'' he added. ``Rather than trying to guess
all the different hypotheticals of what might happen, I just think
we have to be patient, wait to see the outcome and then decide what
other steps should be taken.''
   Gephardt aides said publicly that nothing has changed in the
past 48 hours, that it has been understood since Super Tuesday that
Gephardt would end his race if he does not win here. The
candidate's wife put it this way on Thursday:
   ``I think Dick has to come in first or a real strong second to
remain in the race, because at some point if you don't do well
here, it becomes difficult to raise money,''' said Jane Gephardt in
an interview with WTVB radio. ``Dick's message will be very popular
in the industrial states, but if we don't do well here, we will not
be able to continue.''
   Gephardt is running third in the polls in Michigan, behind
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson. Later
Thursday, Gephardt mimicked Dukakis' claim of turning around the
Massachusetts economy, adapting it to his campaign by saying ``This
Saturday we're going to have a miracle in Michigan _ the Michigan
miracle.''
   Tuesday is the deadline for Gephardt to file for re-election for
his House seat. A meeting has been scheduled this weekend for the
Democrats who have filed for the seat.
   One reason for the withdrawal _ and the congressional race _
would be to take care of any debts left over from the presidential
bid.
   ``Only as Rep. Gephardt can he raise the money to pay off the
debts'' from the presidential campaign, one aide said.
   But Gephardt spokesman Mark Johnson denied the campaign had a
big debt and said that is not a factor.
   One of Gephardt's problems was inadvertantly emphasized by the
presence of United Auto Workers president Owen Bieber at Gephardt's
news conference.
   The UAW has not endorsed any candidate, and Bieber refused to
say he would vote for Gephardt in the caucuses. Union backing would
be a major boost to a candidate in the low-turnout caucus process,
but particularly for Gephardt, whose trade policies have had strong
UAW backing.
   ``I come here today because I want to pay my respects to Rep.
Gephardt and the respects of my union to a person who has fought
very hard to bring about fair trade,'' Bieber said.
   Gephardt gave a lengthy speech to the Detroit Economic Club,
trying to explain again his trade positions and the reasons his
ideas have encountered such resistance.
   ``We will not open markets abroad until we first open minds here
at home,'' the Missouri congressman said, adding ``The free market
is not sacred.''
   He mentioned only one opponent by name, chiding Dukakis for now
supporting trade legislation that he earlier opposed.
   ``I welcome converts,'' Gephardt said. ``But we need more than a
political tactic _ we need a real policy commitment.''
   Gephardt laid out in his speech why he thought his trade
legislation has been denounced so strongly.
   ``The powerful voices ... are dogmatic and outdated,'' he
said.``They see things, not as they are, but as they wish them to
be.''
   `Many of our trading partners are using our outdated assumptions
_ our theology _ to take advantage of us,'' he said.
   And Gephardt rejected the allegation that his trade policies are
somehow racist.
   ``Those of us who are calling for more realistic trade polices
are accused of Japanese-bashing,'' he said. ``The issue here is not
nationality, but the rationality of our trading arrangements.''

   Angry unionized employees of Eastern Airlines
and supporters from other labor organizations rallied outside the
Capitol on Wednesday in an effort to bring attention to their
disputes with the carrier.
   The demonstrators, estimated at 1,200 by their leaders, heard
speeches from several union leaders and from Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa.
   ``I want airline pilots who belong to strong unions, so if they
know they have unsafe conditions or unsafe airplanes, they can park
that airplane and know they still have their jobs,'' Harkin told
the crowd.
   Some Eastern pilots have complained that they have been
pressured by company officials to fly aircraft that they believe
need repairs. Eastern officials have said they would never allow
unsafe planes to fly.
   Unions at Eastern have been battling the airline on a number of
issues in recent years, aiming much of their fire at Frank Lorenzo,
the chief executive of the Miami-based carrier. Lorenzo has been
trying to reduce costs at the financially ailing airline, but the
unions say his goal is to reduce the power of labor.

   Here are some comments Thursday by candidates
for the presidency:
   
   RICHARD GEPHARDT, asked if he would drop out of the presidential
race if he loses Michigan: ``No. I'm running for president and I'm
doing very well here in Michigan. .... My mother always told me to
cross one bridge at a time. That's what I'm trying to do.''
   
   PAUL SIMON, speculating he will pick up supporters if Gephardt
withdraws: ``There's no question there are some union leaders who
are now supporting Dick Gephardt who would find Paul Simon the most
attractive of the alternatives.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, calling for an increase in the minimum wage:
``I don't see how you can support a family on $3.35 an hour.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, saying a top priority as president would be to
stop drugs: ``As president, I will meet with the heads of state
where drugs are grown ... and stop the flow of drugs. Our borders
are exposed to the No. 1 killer of our people.''
   
   ALBERT GORE, saying he would have no problem in giving details
of more than $1 million in loans taken out by his campaign:
``There's nothing that is in any violation of any laws or
regulations and there's no cause for suggesting that there is.''

<HEAD>Meese Says Bork Was Victim of `Character Assassination'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judge Robert H. Bork was a victim of
``political muscle and character assassination'' who would have
fought excesses by the judiciary had he been seated on the Supreme
Court, Attorney General Edwin Meese III said Thursday.
   Bork's Supreme Court nomination was turned down 58-42 in the
Senate on Oct. 23 by ``those partisans who would impermissibly seek
to reshape the Constitution into a vehicle for their own limited
political beliefs,'' Meese said in remarks prepared for delivery
Thursday night to the Joseph Story Society, a conservative lawyers'
group.
   A copy of Meese's remarks was released at the Justice Department.
   ``No one ... deserves a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court more than
Robert H. Bork,'' Meese said of the appeals court judge who drew
strong opposition for his conservative views on the role of the
judiciary and other constitutional issues.
   Meese said the forces opposed to Bork's nomination ``used
political muscle and character assassination to thwart the
appointment of a most deserving person.''
   Bork and legal scholar Raoul Berger, who were being honored at
an awards banquet of the society, have fought unwarranted judicial
activism which has been ``advocated by those forces who like to be
called `progressive,''' Meese said.
   ``But ... their version of modern progressivism has passed
democracy by, leaving it to today's conservatives to do what
yesterday's progressives did: defend democracy,'' the attorney
general said.
   Meese cited as an example of judicial activism a federal judge's
ruling in Kansas City ordering additions to the facilities of local
schools, and ``a doubling of the property tax rate to pay for
them.''
   He also criticized the ruling of a judge in St. Louis who
decreed a busing scheme for schools and vowed to require higher
property taxes to pay for it if the voters failed to do so.
   Meese said judicial activism forecloses opportunities for local
expression and leaves ``a drastically reduced scope for the
institutions that are representative of citizen views.''
   ``The pattern here is a subtle but dangerous transformation of
the Constitution, such that it becomes less a plan of government
and more an instrument for the regulation of potentially every
personal action or policy decision _ regulation that the people
themselves become powerless to control,'' Meese said.

<TEXT>
   Mensa, the nationwide organization of high
IQs, is looking for a few good brains.
   In an attempt to boost enrollment, 43 Mensa chapters around the
country are using newspaper ads to invite people who think they are
among the top 2 percent in intelligence to ``flex those mental
muscles'' in a qualifying test.
   The ad reads: ``If you can score at or above the 98th percentile
on a standard IQ test, you may be able to join Mensa, the society
for the highly intelligent.'' The ad then lists how to register for
the test, which costs $20.
   ``A lot of people haven't got the foggiest notion of what their
IQ is,'' said Philip Johnson of Yakima, secretary of the Central
Washington chapter.
   The chapter has about 50 members, and 10 people responded to its
newspaper advertising, Johnson said.
   ``Statistically, if you are talking about 2 percent of the
population, and assuming Yakima is representative, we ought to have
1,000 people in Yakima qualify,'' Johnson said.
   Don Pendley, development officer for American Mensa Ltd. in New
York City, said there are 56,000 members nationally from a pool of
about 5 million potential qualifiers.
   ``We've been growing about 3 percent per year in the last three
years,'' Pendley said in a telephone interview. ``Growth of 8 to 10
percent per year would make us happy.''
   The national headquarters gave $10,000 in February to local
chapters to buy advertising. The money was appropriated on a
first-come, first-served basis to 43 of the 145 chapters.
   So far the ads have appeared in Washington, D.C.; Louisville,
Ky.; Savannah, Ga., and St. Joseph, Mo., she said.
   In the past, the group has placed ads in specialized magazines,
primarily scientific or literary journals, Pendley said.
   ``Obviously people with high IQs read newspapers as much or more
than the average Joe,'' he said, adding it was too early to judge
the response from the newspaper ads.
   The group was also surprised at the response it got after
articles appeared in Playboy and Reader's Digest, Pendley said. ``I
don't think anybody would qualify those magazines for the
superintelligent,'' he said.
   Scoring among the top 2 percent nationally in any standardized
IQ test is the only requirement for membership, which costs $33 per
year, Johnson said.
   ``It's not uncommon to find people in the top 2 percent in
prison,'' he said. ``High IQ people tend to frequently be high
school dropouts.
   ``The only thing Mensas have in common other than IQ is their
diversity,'' said Johnson, whose jobs have included police
dispatcher, accounting teacher, computer analyst and irrigation
canal manager.
   For the last two years he has operated his own pressure-washer
business, which cleans large items like trucks and buildings.
   In central Washington, over half the Mensa members work at the
federal government's Hanford nuclear reservation near Richland, he
said.
   With the phasing out of plutonium production there, the local
chapter could soon be hurting unless it finds new members, Johnson
said.
   Mensa, which was founded in England in 1946, is primarily a
social organization, promising stimulating activities and
conversation, Pendley said.
   The tests measure logical and mathematical reasoning skills and
the ability to distinguish relationships between words. ``Studying
wouldn't help very much,'' Pendley said.

<HEAD>CBS-Times Poll Has Dukakis, Bush Tied</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael
Dukakis run neck-and-neck as favorites for the presidency, while
Bush outpolls other potential Democratic nominees, a CBS News-New
York Times poll said Thursday.
   Among Democratic voters alone, Dukakis was seen as the candidate
with the best chance of beating Bush in November, the survey said.
Bush has a commanding lead in his race for the Republican
presidential nomination.
   In a Bush-Dukakis matchup, 46 percent of all registered voters
polled said they favored Bush and 45 percent chose Dukakis. The
margin of error for the survey was plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
   Bush polled 51 percent support to 36 percent for Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee and 56 percent to 32 percent for Jesse
Jackson. The poll did not include a matchup of Bush vs. Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri or Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois.
   In a similar poll reported Wednesday by ABC News and the
Washington Post, Dukakis had 50 percent support, Bush 45. That
survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 points, so the
spread did not signify a lead.
   Among likely Democratic voters in the CBS-Times poll, 53 percent
said Dukakis had the best chance of defeating Bush in the general
election. Twelve percent said Jackson, 9 percent Gore, 8 percent
Gephardt and 6 percent Simon.
   When the CBS-Times poll asked the same question in a Feb. 17-21
poll, far fewer Democrats _ 38 percent _ said Dukakis has the best
chance to beat Bush. Gephardt was next with 20 percent and Jackson
had only 5 percent.
   On Super Tuesday, however, Dukakis and Jackson won five states
apiece, while Gephardt won only his native state. Gore also won
five states, but in the poll that did not translate into an
expectation he was more likely to beat Bush.
   In the Democratic primary race, 29 percent of the Democratic
respondents favored Dukakis for the nomination, 22 percent Jackson,
14 percent Gore, 8 percent Gephardt and 6 percent Simon. Seventeen
percent said they didn't know.
   The support from Jackson was up from 13 percent in the February
CBS-Times poll, while the support for Dukakis was up from 21
percent and Gore's was up from 8 percent. Gephardt previously had
12 percent, Simon, 6.
   The CBS-Times poll included telephone interviews of 1,271
randomly chosen registered voters nationwide from Saturday through
Tuesday, of whom 528 were likely Democratic primary voters.
   The sampling error for the Democrats was 5 points.

<HEAD>Gore Used Future Federal Matching Funds As Collateral For Loans</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Gore campaign releasing details on

<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s presidential campaign
confirmed Thursday it borrowed more than $1.4 million early this
month, putting up collateral that included future federal matching
funds and a personal guarantee by the candidate himself.
   Gore, who was questioned about the loans earlier in the day,
said he did not object to releasing the details.
   Gore spokesman Mark Armour said the loans were secured by the
campaign's federal matching funds, plus accounts receivable and a
personal guarantee totaling $40,000 by Gore himself.
   The campaign issued a statement saying it borrowed $750,000 from
Sovran-D.C. National Bank on March 1, pledging future
contributions, federal matching funds and other future income as
collateral.
   The Gore campaign also borrowed $400,000 on March 11 from Union
Planters Bank in Memphis, Tenn., secured by a guarantee from Gore
and future matching funds.
   The campaign said it borrowed $100,000 from each of three
smaller banks in Tennessee on March 1, also secured by the
candidate's guarantee and future matching funds.
   Armour denied that the banks showed any special favor in
granting the loans, stating, ``They were all handled at arm's
length through lawyers on both sides.''
   ``There's nothing that is in any violation of any laws or
regulations and there's no cause for suggesting that there is,''
Gore said at a news conference.
   The Gore campaign previously has acknowledged only that it had
established a $1 million line of credit to be used as necessary for
television advertising on Super Tuesday.
   On Thursday, The Tennessean newspaper in Nashville reported that
Gore's campaign had put up the proceeds of future fund-raisers and
federal matching funds as collateral for almost $1.5 million
borrowed from banks about two weeks ago.
   ``I have no problem with telling you the amount of the loans and
which banks they came from, be glad to,'' Gore told reporters.
   Gore said details of the loans would be contained in reports to
be filed in the next two or three weeks with the Federal Election
Commission ``so if you can wait two or three weeks all of that will
be available, but as for now I have no problem with giving you the
amount of the loans, the banks et cetera.''
   The next FEC reporting date is April 20. The loans were taken
out after Feb. 29 so they did not have to be disclosed March 20.
   The due date for the Gore loans is July 15, three days before
the Democratic National Convention begins in Atlanta.
   The latest Gore FEC disclosure, made public Sunday, covers the
period from Feb. 1 to Feb. 29.
   It shows that, to date, Gore has spent $6 million on his
presidential bid, and had $342,964 in cash on hand as of Feb. 29.
   The capaign has taken in $1.5 million this month, Armour said.
   The Gore campaign also announced Thursday that it has retained
media consultant David Garth to manage all of Gore's media for the
critical New York primary on April 19.

   A 23-year-old investment adviser accused of
using $10 million in clients' money to buy himself an art
collection, a beach house, fancy cars and other luxuries will
probably plead guilty to fraud, his lawyer said Thursday.
   David Bloom briefly appeared before a federal magistrate
Thursday and waived his right to have the case heard by a grand
jury. He is charged with mail fraud and securities fraud.
   Although Bloom entered an innocent plea at the proceeding, his
lawyer, Peter Morrison, said Bloom is expected to plead guilty
March 31.
   Prosecutors said Bloom, who wasn't licensed as an investment
adviser, told clients their funds were invested in the stock market
when he actually was pouring the money into private purchases.
   They included artworks totaling $5.5 million; an $830,000
Manhattan apartment; a $1.9 million beach house in East Hampton, an
Aston-Martin convertible and Mercedes-Benz worth a combined
$200,000, and home furnishings that cost $800,000.
   Bloom also bought expensive jewelry and deluxe trips to Europe
and the Caribbean for himself, his family and friends, according to
the government.
   He is also accused of falsely telling investors that he managed
money for prominent individuals and investors, including the
Rockefeller family, the Sultan of Brunei and Bill Cosby.
   If found guilty, Bloom faces a maximum sentence of five years in
prison on each count and a maximum fine of twice the amount lost by
investors.
   Bloom was arrested Jan. 14. He had begun investing money for
friends while at Duke University and had 130 clients at the time of
his arrest.

<TEXT>
   A top opposition leader returned from
exile to a hero's welcome Thursday and said he will join his
countrymen's struggle which he said has ``but one objective _ to
get rid of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.''
   The return of Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the Christian
Democratic Party, came on the fourth day of a nationwide strike
aimed at Noriega's ouster. The strikers' solidarity seemed
unbroken, with Panama at a virtual standstill.
   Panama's Roman Catholic archbishop, Marcos G. McGrath,
acknowledged meeting with Noriega Thursday morning, but denied
rumors he was trying to mediate the general's departure.
   McGrath told an Associated Press reporter when stopped outside
his home, ``We have met with the general a number of times in the
past few months and we will meet with him again soon.''
   Asked if he was acting as go-between for Noriega's exit, McGrath
said, ``No.''
   The church's Episcopal Conference of Bishops met Wednesday,
raising opposition hopes that the bishops would demand Noriega's
removal. But the closed-door session ended with no communique.
   There was speculation the bishops remained silent awaiting the
outcome of the McGrath-Noriega meeting Thursday.
   A cheering crowd of more than 300 people greeted Arias Calderon
at the airport.
   Arias Calderon, who is considered a presidential aspirant in
elections scheduled for May 1989, told the crowd: ``I am profoundly
moved to be back in my own land. We have but one objective _ to get
rid of Noriega and build reconciliation and democracy in Panama.''
   He rejected any talks with the government, as suggested this
week by Noriega's new, hand-picked civilian chief executive, Manuel
Solis Palma.
   ``Solis Palma is simply a voice, the recent voice for Noriega.
He means absolutely nothing for this country,'' Arias Calderon said.
   His flight was delayed more than an hour because the Panamanian
airline, COPA, at first refused to let him board at San Jose, Costa
Rica, citing government orders.
   Guillermo Cochez, the Christian Democratic Party's vice
president, called it an ``attempt to intimidate him, to get him to
back down. But it was the government that backed down instead.''
   With Arias Calderon were five Christian Democratic legislators
from Venezuela, Costa Rica and West Germany to help ensure his
safety. At least 100 journalists covered his arrival.
   Despite virtually unanimous support for the general strike by
business and industry, Noriega _ head of the 15,000-member Defense
Forces and the power behind the civilian government _ remained
defiant.
   He said his foes at home and in the United States don't ``have
the capacity'' to overthrow him.
   That feeling appeared to be shared by some strike leaders, who
said it might take a revolt by fellow officers to remove Noriega as
military chief.
   ``There are growing pockets within the Defense Forces that are
against Noriega,'' said Jose Mulino, an attorney and opposition
leader. ``What we don't know is if they will act.''
   But in a Wednesday night speech, Noriega claimed the military
was maintaining ``its high moral and patriotic beliefs'' despite a
failed barracks coup last week.
   Eleven officers were arrested in that foiled plot. Noriega
dismissed more than a dozen officers and shifted the assignments of
other key personnel.
   Still, the members of the Defense Forces are due to be paid
Friday, and opposition leaders said their loyalty to Noriega could
be tested anew if they don't get their paychecks.
   Panama is out of cash because Washington cut off the supply of
U.S. dollars, the Panamanian national currency, in a bid to drive
Noriega into exile. The general was indicted in the United States
last month on federal cocaine trafficking charges.
   The government was unable to fully meet a $33 million payroll
for 130,000 public employees earlier this month, touching off a
series of strikes and massive demonstrations by workers once
considered loyal to Noriega.
   The next semi-monthly paychecks for most government employees
are due next week, following the military payday, and they could be
stirred to renewed fury if the army gets paid and they don't.
   Arias Calderon shared second place on a losing presidential
ticket in 1984 and has made himself highly visible in the more than
nine months of civic demonstrations and protests against Noriega.
   In addition to his party leadership, he is a member of the
National Civic Crusade, a coalition of about 200 business,
professional, labor and political groups seeking Noriega's removal.
   Arias Calderon was denied entry Feb. 25 when he sought to return
to Panama from a business trip to Miami. That was the day former
President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to dismiss Noriega, but was in
turn deposed by the general.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle, who is in hiding in
Panama.

   President Reagan said Thursday the United
States is not going to play ``big colossus of the North'' and use
military force to get Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega out of power.
   In a question-and-answer session with high school students in
this Washington suburb, Reagan was asked if he thought it would be
necessary to resume U.S. military control in Panama to protect the
safety of the canal zone.
   ``No, we're going to abide by the canal treaty (relinquishing
the canal to the Panamanians by the turn of the century),'' he
replied. ``And we're not going to be the big colossus of the North
once again, coming in to ... our smaller neighbors' places of
living and business and trying to guide and direct them.''
   The president said the Panamanians ``have a very difficult
problem there. We think that they're moving toward solving it with
the reaction of the people to the man that has caused so much of
this problem.''
   Reagan said the United States wants ``to be of help in any way
we can, and so we've helped them in that regard in the economic
restraints that we've put down there so that there can be pressure
focused on this particular individual.''
   ``But there's no danger of us coming in with our power and
muscle and saying, `This is the way it has to be.'''
   Meanwhile, the office of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said that
the federal Agency for International Development will provide
emergency food to the people of Panama, at least $25,000 worth of
food per day to be distributed through Caritas, a Catholic relief
agency.
   The money for the food would come from the federal disaster
relief fund, said Ed Martin, a D'Amato spokesman. He said he did
not know how long the aid would continue.
   AID officials could not immediately be reached for comment. A
man answering the phone there late Thursday said no one was in the
agency's Latin bureau. The agency was known to be considering such
a move.
   Panama is out of cash because Washington cut off the supply of
U.S. dollars, the Panamanian national currency, in a bid to drive
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega into exile. The general was indicted in

   Democrats who had hoped to succeed
Rep. Richard Gephardt faced the prospect Thursday of having to bow
out amid reports Gephardt would abandon his presidential bid and
seek re-election to the House.
   ``I'm a little upset,'' said state Rep. Phil Barry, a St. Louis
County Democrat considered one of the leading contenders to replace
Gephardt, the 3rd Congressional District representative for six
terms.
   ``I'm saddened. I guess that's a nice way to put it,'' said
Barry, who has the endorsement of labor and other groups and has
raised about $27,000.
   Six Democrats have filed for the seat, and at least two others
are considering a bid.
   A Gephardt campaign aide who insisted on anonymity said
Wednesday that if Gephardt did not win the Michigan caucuses
Saturday he probably would announce the end of his campaign Monday
and file for re-election.
   Gephardt later denied that he was considering such a move.
   Missouri Democratic Party Chairman Karen Schafer said she
thought that if Gephardt decided to seek re-election the other
candidates would not have much choice but to step aside.
   ``It's going to be a big blow to some of them but they all knew
when they got in that Gephardt could come back,'' Mrs. Schafer
said. ``They're prepared for it.''
   Barry said he most likely would step aside if Gephardt wanted to
keep his congressional seat.
   John Temporiti, the first Democrat to file for the seat and an
active campaigner, was out of his office Thursday, his secretary
said. Temporiti is a lawyer and former chief of staff for St. Louis
Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr.
   To be a candidate for his congressional seat, Gephardt would
have to file with the Missouri secretary of state's office by the
close of business Tuesday.
   He could file for the House seat and remain in the presidential
race but would have to withdraw from the congressional race if he
were to win the presidential nomination.
   Other Democrats to file are George Kerry, Gephardt's top St.
Louis aide; James Whitt, a house painter; Barbara Vires, a retired
high school teacher, and Ed Roche, who has run for Congress five
times.
   Four Republicans have filed, but none was expected to be a
serious challenge in the heavily Democratic district.

   Rep. James Howard suffered a heart attack
Thursday and was hospitalized in very critical condition, officials
said.
   Howard, 60, chairman of the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee, collapsed on a Maryland golf course near
Washington at about 10 a.m., his office said.
   The New Jersey Democrat was taken to Montgomery General Hospital
in Olney, Md., where doctors revived him after two hours, hospital
spokeswoman Linda Janzik said.
   He had suffered a heart attack, which stopped his heart, and he
was listed in very critical condition, Ms. Janzik said.
   He later was taken by helicopter to the cardiac unit of the
Washington Hospital Center, she said.
   ``He was breathing on his own,'' Ms. Janzik said.
   Howard's office said Wednesday night he was in ``critical
condition'' and under intensive care. His wife, Marlene, and
daughter, Marie, were with him.
   Howard, the victim of two previous heart attacks, collapsed at
the Manor Country Club in Rockville, Md.
   Coleman Plecker, a golf pro at the club, told the Montgomery
(Md.) Journal that he saw Howard collapse. The pro said he ran over
and started administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Two Montgomery County firefighters who happened to be golfing at
the time then took over resuscitation efforts until a rescue squad
arrived, Plecker said.
   ``If anything could be done for that guy, he was lucky to have
those guys right there,'' Plecker said.
   Howard was hospitalized for several days in 1984 in an episode
doctors attributed to fatigue. He is a heavy cigarette smoker.
   A former schoolteacher and principal, Howard has been in
Congress since 1965.
   He gained his congressional seat on the coattails of President
Johnson's 1964 victory. During the Reagan landslide of 1980, Howard
retained his seat by a margin of only about 2,000 votes over his
GOP challenger.
   In 1986, the Democrat won re-election with 59 percent of the
vote in a largely Republican district.
   He has been chairman of the public works committee since 1981.

   Congress and the Reagan administration warmly
welcomed a Nicaraguan cease-fire agreement Thursday, and some
officials said it could usher in a new era of bipartisan U.S.
policymaking on Central America.
   ``We consider this agreement to be an important step forward,''
said Secretary of State George Shultz, who added that the truce
leaves ``no excuse'' for continued Soviet-bloc weapons shipments to
the leftist Managua government.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the Nicaraguan agreement
marks ``a new chapter in the unhappy history of that war-torn
country'' and vowed to move ahead before Easter on a package of
humanitarian aid for the Contra rebels.
   Later, appearing on PBS' MacNeil-Lehrer ``NewsHour,'' Shultz
indicated the administration might ask Congress to include in any
humanitarian aid package a provision guaranteeing a speedy vote on
a military aid request if the peace process breaks down.
   ``I do think there is great merit ... to have in it a mechanism
for a fast-track vote,'' Shultz said.
   Such a provision, he said, would help ``to have a little
strength visible in the picture even though it isn't there.''
   But Wright, appearing on the same program, suggested he would
oppose such a provision.
   He said the package should include food, clothing and medical
assistance for the Contras. Asked whether the legislation should
ensure an early vote on military aid if President Reagan asks for
it, Wright said, ``I want to emphasize positive things, and not
anticipate failure.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn, a leading Contra opponent, said,
``This is a bad day for the cynics. A piece of paper has been
signed by people who many thought would never be able to sit down
face to face.''
   But the White House and some in Congress also said the accord,
while a strong sign of new health for the regional peace process,
rests heavily on promises of future moves by both sides that could
prove difficult.
   Reagan, getting into his limousine after speaking to high school
students in suburban Vienna, Va., was asked whether he thought the
cease-fire agreement would hold up.
   ``I don't know. We're looking carefully at it,'' he replied.
   ``There is a lot of room for encouragement here, yes, but
there's also a lot of room for skepticism, and I'm trying to
balance those two off,'' said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   ``We're beginning the process. We need to watch it. We've seen
processes like this start before and fail,'' he said. ``This seems
like a more concrete step, and there certainly reason to be
hopeful. But I do not want to play down the skepticism side of it
either because we are skeptical.''
   Congressional leaders and the administration began conferring on
a new package of aid to the Contras on Wednesday, and more meetings
were scheduled for Monday. Wright said a vote could come later next
week and food, clothing and medicine could begin flowing to the
rebels by Easter.
   The cease-fire agreement reached Wednesday night in Sapoa,
Nicaragua, calls for ``exclusively humanitarian'' aid for the
rebels to be channeled through a ``neutral'' organization,
presumably the United Nations, the Red Cross, the Organization of
American States or some similar group.
   Wright said any aid package would have to conform to that
language, and Democratic leaders on the issue said that would rule
out provisions for future military aid to the rebels.
   But some Republicans insisted that any aid bill include
provision for a quick vote in Congress on new military aid if the
Sandinistas fail to live up to promises made in the cease-fire
agreement, including amnesty and the release of prisoners.
   ``I think it is important to keep in there some speeded-up
mechanism for the president and Congress to get together in case
the peace process fails,'' said Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash., a sponsor
of a Contra aid package that includes such a guaranteed vote.
   ``It's a recognition that there is still lots of skepticism,
maybe even suspicion, all the way around,'' Evans said. ``People
have been at each other's throats, and that's not going to
dissipate easily.''
   But of such suggestions, Wright said: ``I think it would be
counterproductive to talk about it ... We don't want to rekindle
the war.''
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said compromise on
language about future Contra aid was possible.
   ``We are willing to talk to the Republicans about anything, but
we are not willing to set up a process that the Nicaraguans could
interpret as allowing for more military aid,'' Coelho said.
   House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois, in Houston
for a GOP issues conference, said he had discussed with Wright on
Wednesday a $48 million, one-year aid package that provided an
expedited vote on further aid in June, although the rules for that
vote remained to be worked out.
   Added Republican Whip Trent Lott of Mississippi: ``The Contras
are still in the field. They still have got to exist ... in case
this thing collapses.''
   Wright aide Wilson Morris said terms discussed Wednesday before
the cease-fire agreement was concluded _ including the $48 million
figure and any process for a quick later aid vote _ would have to
be reviewed in light of the Sandinista-Contra accord. ``I think
that can be worked out,'' Morris said.
   ``It looks like there may be a pretty good possibility of
Congress getting together on something the administration could
buy,'' Evans said.
   ``We haven't had a strong voice for American policy in Central
America in five years'' because of partisan divisions over the
administration's Contra policy,'' he said. ``We would finally be
sending a clear message.''
   ``For heaven's sake, if the Nicaraguans, who have been shooting
at each other, can agree, surely Republicans and Democrats can
agree,'' Wright said.
   The promises of quick action on a new aid package for the rebels
contrasted sharply with the inaction of recent weeks. The issue had
been stalled since the House narrowly defeated a $30 million
humanitarian aid package on March 3, and the rebels have been
without U.S. assistance since Feb. 29.
   Coelho said lawmakers had been intentionally moving slowly on
the issue since March 17, when Contra leaders called Wright's
office and said they were optimistic about achieving a cease-fire
in the talks that began Monday and asked that Congress hold back on
voting for new aid.

   Speeding through stiff winds
and heavy seas early Thursday, we closed in on an Iranian landing
craft that served as mother ship for speedboat attacks on neutral
ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
   The decks were lashed by 15-foot waves and winds gusting to 50
knots but Cmdr Paul X. Rinn, skipper of this 445-foot guided
missile frigate, covered the the 45 miles to the Hengham-class
landing craft and halted his pursuit 4,600 yards from his quarry.
   While there was no actual confrontation, not even a radio
exchange, the presence of the American warship appeared to distract
the landing craft Tomb from its mission. U.S. officers said that
mission apparently was to serve as a floating base for speedboats
that attack ships with machine-gun and rocket grenade fire.
   ``He now knows we know where he is. We can come back now and
find him any time we want,'' Rinn told reporters in a Pentagon news
pool aboard the Roberts.
   Increasingly, warships such as U.S. Navy Fast Frigate No. 88 are
closely monitoring the activities of Iranian warships in the
southern Persian Gulf.
   Their purpose apparently is to discourage Iranian attacks on
neutral shipping in the waterway, where Iran and Iraq have been at
war since September 1980.
   Such missions may reflect a subtle but potentially significant
shift in Navy policy under Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less, who took
command of the Joint Task Force Middle East and its gulf component
last month.
   American officers say there is no change in the ``rules of
engagement.'' Those permit Navy ships to offer ``humanitarian
assistance'' to neutral ships in distress that request help but
prohibit them from interceding to stop an attack on a ship not
flying the Stars and Stripes
   However, with the success of its primary mission to escort
convoys of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers through these hazardous
waters, the Navy may be adopting a more visible role to deter
Iranian attacks.
   Rinn, a 40-year New Yorker who now lives in Summerville, S.C.,
parried questions about any new mission. His instructions
concerning Iranian activity remain clear, he said: ``Do not close
(on) him; do not harass him; leave him alone.''
   The first sign of a shift in approach comes at a time when Iran
and Iraq have resumed attacks on gulf shipping.
   Iraq uses warplanes to strike shuttle tankers carrying Iranian
oil through the gulf. Tehran retaliates with raids by speedboats
and larger vessels on neutral shipping.
   Nearly 500 ships have been damaged since the war began and more
than 300 sailors have been killed.
   After the dash to draw within close range of the Iranian craft,
Rinn said it tried to turn the tables by approaching to within
1,200 yards of the Roberts soon after dawn Thursday. The American
warship abruptly changed course, wheeling on the approaching
Iranian, and it altered course.
   The Tomb kept to a parallel course as the Roberts sailed into
the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow southern gate to the Persian Gulf,
and joined its sister ship Jack Williams and the frigate USS Bagley.
   They sailed westward into the teeth of a continuing shamal, a
gulf storm that blows from the northwest and typically lasts about
24 hours. Winds exceeded 25 knots most of the day. Seas ran more
than 15 feet, rolling the ships on their beams.
   Under clear skies, the roaring winds churned the relatively
shallow Persian Gulf into a white-capped maelstrom. Waves crashed
over the bows of the warships and their hulls were exposed to view
as they hobby-horsed up the Hormuz.
   Although routine for the 202 crew members, pursuit of the
Iranian vessel had considerable minute-by-minute drama. The Roberts
combat information center, its computer screens aglow like a video
arcade, tracked a variety of unidentified air and sea ``contacts''
as the ship headed south.
   Rinn ordered his second gas turbine engine fired up to help
drive the ship at up to 26 knots, then varied speed as the Tomb
became a visible light in the distance.
   Huge waves were illuminated by phosphorescent plankton and
jellyfish, glowing like submerged flashlights of green, blue and
white.
   The 4,200-ton Roberts rolled as much as 35 degrees during the
dash down the gulf, causing equipment not lashed down to clatter
across the decks, tipping over chairs in the officers' wardroom and
spilling some off-duty sailors from their berths.
   The seas became so rough that the lookout stationed in a chair
on the ship's ``bullnose'' was pulled in for fear he might be
washed overboard.

   President Reagan said Thursday the United
States is not going to play ``big colossus of the North'' and use
military force to get Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega out of power.
   In a question-and-answer session with high school students in
this Washington suburb, Reagan was asked if he thought it would be
necessary to resume U.S. military control in Panama to protect the
safety of the canal zone.
   ``No, we're going to abide by the canal treaty (relinquishing
the canal to the Panamanians by the turn of the century),'' he
replied. ``And we're not going to be the big colossus of the North
once again, coming in to ... our smaller neighbors' places of
living and business and trying to guide and direct them.''
   The president said the Panamanians ``have a very difficult
problem there. We think that they're moving toward solving it with
the reaction of the people to the man that has caused so much of
this problem.''
   Reagan said the United States wants ``to be of help in any way
we can, and so we've helped them in that regard in the economic
restraints that we've put down there so that there can be pressure
focused on this particular individual.''
   ``But there's no danger of us coming in with our power and
muscle and saying, `This is the way it has to be.'''
   Meanwhile, the federal Agency for International Development has
agreed to release $250,000 in emergency funds to buy food for the
poor in Panama.
   The food will be purchased in Panama if it is available and
distributed through Caritas, a Catholic relief agency said AID
spokesman Jim Kunder.
   Panama is out of cash because Washington cut off the supply of
U.S. dollars, the Panamanian national currency, in a bid to drive
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega into exile. The general was indicted in
the United States last month on federal cocaine trafficking charges.
   The Panamanian government was unable to fully meet a $33 million
payroll for 130,000 public employees earlier this month, touching
off a series of strikes and massive demonstrations by workers once
considered loyal to Noriega.

   One of two British soldiers killed by the Irish
Republicn Army at a funeral last week was buried Thursday with full
military honors.
   Cpl. Derek Wood, 24, of the Royal Corps of Signals was buried
next to his mother's grave at St. Peter's Church, Carshalton, near
London, where he was christened.
   Army comrades carried his casket, which was draped in the
British flag and had Wood's army cap resting on it. A lone bugler
sounded taps and an army firing party shot off three volleys in the
air toward his grave.
   Wood and Cpl. David Howes, 23, also of the Royal Corps of
Signals, were attacked by members of the Roman Catholic procession
when they drove up to the funeral cortege of IRA guerrilla Kevin
Brady in west Belfast last Saturday.
   An inscription on an unsigned card with a floral spray at Wood's
funeral read: ``Corporals Derek Wood and David Howes died heroes
whilst amongst cowards. God bless and rest in peace.''
   In scenes that shocked television audiences around the world,
members of the enraged crowd were seen to drag the two soldiers
from their car, strip them and beat them with iron bars. The two
were then taken to a nearby Gaelic football ground where IRA gunmen
shot them to death.

   Fallen financier Ivan F. Boesky on
Thursday spent his first full day at a minimum-security prison
nicknamed ``Club Fed,'' where he was sent to serve a three-year
sentence for insider trading.
   Boesky's arrival Wednesday received more attention than anyone
else's since White House aide H.R. Haldeman reported to serve time
for his part in the Watergate scandal, said Chuck LaRoe, the
warden's executive assistant.
   Boesky, 51, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to lie to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The earliest he can be released
from prison is March 22, 1989.
   The federal prison camp is situated 150 miles north of Los
Angeles. It is on 44,000 acres of heavily forested land.
   It has earned a reputation as a country club among prisons
because it offers cable television, tennis, weightlifting, boccie,
billiards and other activities to inmates.
   Jobs open to Boesky include work in the prison's furniture
factory, dairy farm or cattle ranch. The once high-flying Wall
Street speculator could also take a clerical job, LaRoe said. Pay
ranges from 11 cents to $1.10 an hour.
   Boesky has declined all contact with the news media and signed a
statement requesting privacy, LaRoe said. He cannot conduct
business while in prison but can receive visitors for up to 50
hours a month.
   Boesky paid the SEC a record $100 million fine in 1986 to settle
civil charges of insider trading, the use of confidential
information to profit in securities deals. He has cooperated
extensively with federal investigators.
   The prison, designed to hold 450 inmates, houses 630.
Overcrowding has forced double-bunking, LaRoe said.

<TEXT>
   Testimony from a former Arizona attorney
general that Gov. Evan Mecham broke the law in borrowing $80,000
from a ``protocol fund'' for his auto dealership was likened to a
``nuclear explosion'' by a lawmaker Thursday.
   The lawmaker, Republican Sen. Tony West, said that according to
former Attorney General Jack LaSota's analysis, Mecham's action
constituted a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a
$150,000 fine.
   LaSota testified Wednesday that the $80,000 was public money and
thus an illegal loan.
   The testimony from LaSota came shortly before the prosecution
rested Thursday on the second impeachment charge against the
first-term Republican governor. LaSota served under Mecham's
predecessor, Democrat Bruce Babbitt.
   ``We have seen some hand grenades go off here. We have seen some
bombshells,'' West told the witness. ``But I think your testimony,
if accurate, is either a nuclear explosion or at least
devastating.''
   ``Why do we not have the proper prosecutorial authorities
investigating this?'' demanded West.
   Impeachment charges against Mecham include misusing or
embezzling public funds through the loan in July from a fund
intended to promote the image of Arizona.
   Senators, who are sitting as judge and jury, previously heard
testimony on a charge that Mecham tried to thwart an investigation
of an alleged death threat by an aide. Still to be heard is a
charge that Mecham concealed a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Mecham is the first U.S. governor to face an impeachment trial
in six decades. He also faces a May 17 recall election and an April
21 trial April 21 on felony charges that he concealed the $350,000
loan.
   The protocol fund was set up with $92,000 raised by Mecham's
inaugural ball. State law barred its intended use to pay off
campaign debts, and an agreement was reached to place it in a fund
for promoting the image of Arizona.
   The prosecution has contended the fund was public money, while
the defense has contended it was private.
   Mecham's lawyer Jerris Leonard has said Mecham will testify that
his car dealership did not need the money and that his only motive
was to increase the protocol fund by borrowing from it at higher
interest than it was then receiving.
   As the defense opened its case on the loan Thursday, the
governor's banker testified he would have given Mecham an $80,000
loan with no collateral because he was a trusted customer.
   Roger Hagadorn, a Valley National Bank vice president who said
he has done business with Mecham, his dealership and his brothers
for 20 years, said the Mechams had good credit and had never
defaulted on a loan.
   Hagadorn said that if he had been asked last summer, he would
have given Mecham an $80,000 loan without collateral and would have
charged him interest of 9.5 or 10 percent. The governor borrowed
from the protocol fund at 9 percent.
   Later, during cross-examination Hagadorn appeared stunned when
prosecutor Paul Eckstein produced a letter showing that Mecham in
fact had defaulted on a loan from Valley National for $101,905.
Hagadorn conceded he might have thought twice about granting
another loan if he had known.
   The bank's letter demanding payment was written on the same day
that Mecham received the $80,000 loan from the protocol fund.
   Earlier, prosecution witness Jeffrey Colville, who said he has
never done business with the governor, said he would have refused
the loan based on financial records of Mecham Pontiac. Colville, a
developer and mortgage banker, said the company was encumbered by
liens for more than the business' appraised value.
   Colville cited liens for $3.7 million and said the most recent
appraisal of the business put its value at $3.35 million.
   Leonard suggested that Colville did not have the complete
records, was misinterpreting the record he did have and didn't know
the banking business well enough to give expert testimony. He also
suggested the appraisal of Mecham Pontiac was too low.
   Mecham's former chief of staff, Jim Colter, has testified he
processed the $80,000 loan without checking the financial condition
of Mecham Pontiac.
   Later in the day, Mecham's former special assistant, Sam
Steiger, testified he thought the loan was ``stupid politically''
but not illegal. He said he had advised Mecham's chief of staff
that the funds could not be construed as public funds.
   ``The argument I used then was these are not taxes; these are
not fees; these are not licenses,'' he said. ``By no stretch of the
imagination would be it be possible to construe these were public
funds.''
   Asked whether he thought Mecham's loan broke the law, Steiger
said, ``I thought it was stupid politically, but I at no time
considered it would be illegal.''

<HEAD>Study: Long-Term Use Does Not Increase Long-Term Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long-term use of birth-control pills, even by
women who began taking them as teen-agers, does not increase the
risk of breast cancer, a new study of more than 9,000 women
concludes.
   The findings were reported in Friday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   Previous studies disagreed over whether the pill increases the
risk of breast cancer for women through middle age. Some
researchers have suggested the conflicting conclusions might be the
result of a long-term latent effect from early use.
   ``But we found no direct human evidence for such a latent
effect,'' said Dr. Bruce Stadel, one of the study's authors. Stadel
was at the National Institutes of Health when the study was
conducted and now is with the Food and Drug Administration in
Bethesda, Md.
   ``This was a very, very large study ... and these data are
immensely reassuring,'' he said. ``Nonetheless, everyone in the
field believes additional large studies should be conducted in the
1990s, when the women we interviewed will be in their mid-60s.''
   Early and prolonged use were defined as using oral
contraceptives for at least six years before age 25, according to
Stadel and his colleagues, who were from the Uniformed Services
University of the Health Sciences at Bethesda, Md.
   Researchers collected case histories and interviewed 4,714 women
through age 54 who had developed breast cancer, then matched them
with a control group of 4,540.
   ``We looked at many different facets, and broke the subjects
into many different groups to isolate other factors,'' said Stadel.
   ``But the thing we consistently found is that women who used the
pill for a long time, whether they were young when they began ...
the relative risks were the same when compared to women who never
used the pill when young.''
   The study did not examine the effects of short-term use.
   For women in general, the risk of developing breast cancer
during one's lifetime is about one in 10, Stadel said. More than 50
million women worldwide are on the pill, he said.

<HEAD>Honduras Protests Alleged Nicaraguan Incursion</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: 10 new grafs UPDATE with Hondurans' saying Nicaraguan
soldiers now out. Picks up 10th graf pvs, Foreign Minister ...</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Honduras filed an ``energetic
protest'' with Nicaragua over what it said were new incursions this
week by 350 Nicaraguan troops, the Foreign Minstry said Thursday.
   Ministry spokesman Eugenio Castro later said the Nicaraguan
troops had pulled out.
   Nicaragua had denied that its soldiers penetrated Honduran
territory.
   Castro said Honduran air force reconnaissance flights on
Thursday found there were no longer Sandinista troops on the
Honduran side of the border.
   ``The situation at the border apparently is calm,'' he told The
Associated Press by telelphone.
   A ministry communique earlier Thursday said 300 heavily armed
Sandinista soldiers crossed the border in the San Andres de Bocay
region, scene of fighting last week when Nicaraguan troops drove
Contra rebels back into Honduras. The area is about 150 miles east
of Tegucigalpa.
   The latest incursion occurred about 8 p.m. Tuesday, about the
same time as 50 other Sandinista soldiers entered Honduras near
Pico Espanol, a village in El Paraiso province about two miles from
the border, the communique said.
   It did not say if there was any combat.
   In Managua, Nicaragua's capital, a Defense Ministry spokesman
was asked about the Honduran report. ``That's negative,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo declined Thursday to discuss
the reported incursions.``We continue to act with prudence,'' he
said.
   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras was in Guatemala on
Thursday for a meeting with other Central American foreign
ministers.
   The government said last week there were up to 2,000 Sandinista
troops in Honduras and later said all had retreated back to
Nicaragua.
   Honduran jets raided Nicaraguan targets in the Bocay region
twice last week and Azcona said then that he would send more
warplanes to attack Nicaraguan troops if they did not leave.
   That incursion and a request for help by Azcona Hoyo resulted in
the emergency deployment of 3,200 U.S. troops to Honduras last week.
   The Americans, who are conducting joint training exercises with
Honduran soldiers, are expected to leave this country early next
week, the Pentagon said.
   Meanwhile, Honduras has asked U.S. Ambassador Everett Briggs for
a clarification on reported comments by U.S. Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci about the reason American soldiers are in Honduras.
   In a news release late Wednesday, Lopez Contreras said he wanted
to know why U.S. authorities were saying the Americans were here to
protect Contra rebels in Honduras.
   ``These (American) troops that came to Honduras were requested
by the government of President Jose Azcona Hoyo regarding the
threat of incursions from the Sandinista army against the national
territory ... and not for the principal objective of fortifying or
protecting the Nicaraguan insurgents who are struggling against the
Sandinista regime,'' Lopez Contreras said.
   He proposed the creation of a peacekeeping force along the
border region.
   Briggs refused to meet leaders of seven citizens organizations
at the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa Thursday.
   The leaders, whose groups are united under the umbrella
Coordinating Committee for Popular Organizations, later met at a
plaza where about 200 people had gathered and read a letter
protesting U.S. troops in Honduras.
   The letter said the presence of U.S. troops in Honduras meant
``that our country has been converted into a battle platform in the
Central American region.''

   Iran and Iraq fired missiles into each
other's capitals Thursday and Tehran threatened to use chemical
bombs in the war unless the United Nations punishes Iraq for using
poison gas.
   Iran said its troops advanced farther into Iraq's northeastern
Kurdistan province, killing or wounding 1,000 Iraqi soldiers, in a
week-old offensive. Iraq denied the claim.
   Shipping executives in the Persian Gulf said the captain of the
267,589-ton Friendship L supertanker reported a fire in the engine
room, raising speculation the vessel may have been raided.
   They said a later report from the ship, which is on charter to
Iran, reported the fire extinguished and denied there had been an
attack.
   In Amman, Jordan, Iran left an Islamic conference after other
delegates criticized it for not heeding calls to accept a
cease-fire in the war, which began in September 1980, and accused
it of instigating bloody riots last year in the holy city of Mecca,
Saudi Arabia.
   Dispatches from Iraq said 13 people were killed and 68 wounded
in two missile explosions in downtown Baghdad. Iran said four
missiles were fired at Baghdad.
   One victim was a woman who was breast-feeding her newborn baby
in a hospital bed. The infant survived, the official Iraqi News
Agency reported.
   Nine houses were demolished in the attacks and two other
children were among the victims, it said.
   The Iraqis said they launched six long-range missiles at Tehran.
Iran reported 10 civilians killed and 100 wounded, and said the
rockets hit two schools, two mosques and two hospitals.
   Iraq has fired 42 missiles into Tehran since March 15. Iran says
it has fired 16 missiles into Baghdad and dozens of short-range
rockets at other Iraqi cities.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's parliament, said Iran
would use chemical weapons if no action was taken against Iraq.
   ``We asked the U.N. to send experts to the Halabja region (in
northeast Iraq) to inspect the effects of the chemical weapons,''
he said on Tehran radio.
   ``If the international organizations refuse to take any step to
punish Iraq, we shall not remain idle. We have the technology to
produce chemical weapons, and although we have not exploited this
yet, we will not remain idle forever.''
   He said Iran has decided ``to punish the aggressor ourselves,''
renewing warnings that Iranian troops along the 733-mile border
would launch an all-out offensive.
   ``At present we have forces and operational plans all over the
battlefront, and should the U.N. Security Council refuse to take
any step towards condemning the aggressor, we shall begin our
operation,'' Rafsanjani declared.
   Iran has said 5,000 people were killed and 5,000 wounded when
Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs on Halabja, Khormal and
Dojaila, three Kurdish towns captured by the Iranians last week.
   Most of Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds live in the northeast and Iran
supports them in a struggle for autonomy.
   Western reporters flown to Halabja by the Iranians earlier this
week reported seeing hundreds of dead civilians, unmarked by
wounds. They said many had died of asphyxiation, apparently caught
unaware in their homes.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Charled Redman said Wednesday in
Washington that Iraq had used chemical weapons, banned under a 1925
Geneva agreement, and urged the U.N. Security Council to protest.
He called the Iraqi action ``a particularly grave violation.''
   Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency said Iranian planes
Thursday inadvertently violated Turkish airspace and dropped two
bombs over southeastern Turkey near the Harbur border post,
breaking windows but causing no casualties.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Inal Batu confirmed the area was
bombed but said the planes' nationality was not known yet.
   Anatolia said the Iranian jets were raiding northern Iraq when
they strayed over Turkey.
   On Tuesday, two Iraqi jets violated Turkish airspace when they
bombed Kurdish guerrilla bases in a joint security zone along the
border.

   The guns were silent Thursday, the
first day of an agreement between the government and Contra rebels
that Nicaraguans pray will bring peace for the first time since
1981. One man called it a miracle.
   In three days of negotiations that resulted in agreement
Wednesday night, both sides called it Nicaragua's last chance for
peace. The formal, 60-day cease-fire is to begin April 1, but they
agreed to extend a truce declared for the talks.
   Nicaragua's Vice President Sergio Ramirez, in Mexico City to
brief Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid on the agreement, told
a news conference ``direct negotiation with the United States
government is more necessary than ever'' to ensure a truce in
Nicaragua.
   The Reagan administration rejected previous Sandinista calls for
direct talks, saying the Nicaraguan government and the rebels must
negotiate first.
   ``Now that we have ... a signed document with the Contras,''
Ramirez said, ``we are disposed to begin direct negotiations with
the United States.''
   In Nicaragua, dozens of women marched to Juigalpa on Thursday,
gathered in the city's main Catholic church and ``lighted candles
to the Virgin Mary'' to mark the agreement, a Defense Ministry
official said.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Alonso Moreno, who owns a shoe store and has three nephews in
the army, said: ``This is the most important thing that has
occcured since 1979 when the Somoza dictatorship was overthrown.''
   Enrique Bolanos, president of the Private Enterprise Council and
staunch critic of the government, called the pact ``a miracle.''
   In Costa Rica, President Oscar Arias said the cease-fire offers
``a new and firm hope that all Central Americans can live in
peace.''
   Arias won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for devising the Central
American peace agreement that calls for cease-fires in the region's
wars.
   During the negotiations at Sapoa, on the Costa Rican border 90
miles south of Managua, President Daniel Ortega made a suprise
visit and said it was time ``to bury once and for all the military
confrontation.''
   Rebel leader Alfredo Cesar told journalists at the meeting: ``It
is not just a chance to achieve peace and harmony, but the only
chance.''
   Leaders of the Sandinistas and the U.S.-sponsored Contras stood
side-by-side on a makeshift dais Wednesday night in Sapoa, sang the
national anthem together and signed the cease-fire.
   During the three days, both sides retreated from hard positions,
especially the Sandinistas, who stand to gain the most from an
agreement that would virtually end the insurgency.
   The Contras agreed not to accept military aid and to receive
non-lethal supplies exclusively from neutral organizations. The
Reagan administration, which has financed the rebels since they
began fighting in late 1981, has been seeking congressional
approval of more funds.
   Provisions of the agreement meet requirements of the regional
peace plan signed Aug. 7 by all five Central American presidents _
ending the fighting, granting political amnesty and restoring
democratic freedoms.
   Opponents of the Sandinistas say the Sandinistas promised
democracy when they overthrew rightist President Anastasio Somoza
in July 1979, but instead established a Marxist regime.
   Although the cease-fire does not begin officially until April 1,
both sides said they would continue the battlefield truce they
declared on Monday, the first day of negotiations.
   Beginning next Monday, also in Sapoa, negotiators will draw the
lines of areas to which rebels will go during the first two weeks
of the official cease-fire.
   Nothing is said in the agreement about the Contras laying down
their weapons, so that may be another subject taken up in next
week's meetings. In past negotiations, the rebels insisted on
keeping their weapons until provisions of any accord were carried
out.
   Also not mentioned is a reduction of the 80,000-member regular
armed forces, largest in Central America. The government claims to
have 300,000 people under arms, including army, reserves and
civilian militia.
   Gradual amnesty is provided for Nicaragua's 3,300 political
prisoners, beginning Sunday. The deal also guarantees
``unrestricted freedom of expression,'' demanded by the rebels, and
permits all exiles to return home.
   With verification that the Contras have moved into the truce
zones, they can send up to eight delegates to participate in
national talks now under way in Nicaragua as part of the regional
peace plan, the agreement says.
   The Sandinistas agreed that the ``issues related to military
service will be dealt with.'' Contra negotiators had insisted
forced military service be ended.
   Ortega's government granted a rebel request that compliance with
the agreement be verified by a commission formed by Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo and the secretary-general of the Organization of
American States, Joao Baena Soares.
   Both were witnesses to the talks and it was Baena Soares who
read the final document aloud. Obando y Bravo had mediated previous
negotiations outside the country.

<HEAD>Gephardt Said Ready to Quit Race; Bush Riding Big Lead Into
Connecticut</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf, However, public, to DELETE reference to Bush
being born in Connecticut</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT FURLOW</BYLINE>

   Democrat Richard Gephardt, who has fallen on hard times since
his Iowa victory 45 days ago, will quit the presidential race
unless he scores an upset victory in Michigan this weekend, aides
said Thursday. George Bush, meanwhile, headed for Connecticut
expecting to pad his huge lead on the GOP side.
   Gephardt said he'd made no decision to drop out, declaring, ``My
mother always told me to cross one bridge at a time.'' But the
scramble was already on to pick up supporters who would be freed if
he withdrew.
   ``There's no question there are some union leaders who are now
supporting Dick Gephardt who would find Paul Simon the most
attractive of the alternatives,'' said Illinois Sen. Simon at an
appearance in Kalamazoo.
   Simon, who is in fourth place in the Democratic delegate count,
just ahead of Gephardt, spoke of getting ``back in the ballgame.''
   Among the Republicans, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, wife of Bush's main rival, Sen. Bob Dole, said in Oshkosh,
Wis., that her husband now has merely a ``long shot'' chance, but
she added, ``He's got the grit and determination needed to keep him
in the running.''
   She said neither she nor her husband have discussed the
possibility that one of them might be Bush's running mate for the
general election. ``I'm really not seeking to be on the ticket. I'm
going 12 hours a day just trying to carry Bob's message,'' she said.
   Vice President Bush, holding a commanding lead in the battle for
Republican convention delegates, was traveling to Connecticut,
saying he was taking nothing for granted in the primary there next
Tuesday.
   However, public opinion polls give him a big lead over Dole in
the state where Bush grew up and where his father once served as a
U.S. senator.
   Bush said at a news conference that it would be premature to
discuss pardons for any of the defendants in the Iran-Contra
affair, and that he did not think fallout from the
arms-for-hostages deal would hurt his campaign.
   ``If it was going to have an impact, I think it would have
before now,'' he said.
   A CBS-New York Times poll suggested Thursday night that a
general election matchup of Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis would be a close race. In the poll, with a 3
percentage-point margin of error, 46 percent picked Bush and 45
percent chose Dukakis, who did the best of any of the Democrats
against Bush in the poll.
   Dukakis was in Los Angeles, campaigning in English and Spanish.
   He denounced U.S. support of Nicaragua's Contra rebels, said he
favored a one-year extension in the deadline for illegal aliens to
apply for amnesty and said when asked about the possibility of a
Hispanic running mate, ``Tal vez. ... Vamos a ver (Perhaps. ...
We'll see).''
   Democratic rival Jesse Jackson campaigned in Madison, Wis.,
telling the Wisconsin Legislature that if he wins the nomination
and election, ``As president, I will meet with the heads of state
where drugs are grown ... and stop the flow of drugs.''
   Albert Gore Jr.'s spokesman said David Garth, a well-known media
consultant who has previously worked for New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,
had been hired to handle the Tennessee senator's advertising for
the New York primary.
   Gephardt, just a few weeks ago the victor in Iowa's caucuses,
now lags behind Dukakis, Jackson, Gore and Simon in delegates to
the national convention. He trails Dukakis and Jackson in public
opinion polls preceding Saturday's Michigan caucuses.
   He said Thursday in Detroit, ``Rather than trying to guess all
the different hypotheticals of what might happen, I just think we
have to be patient, wait to see the outcome and then decide what
other steps should be taken.''
   Still, Gephardt's wife Jane told a radio interviewer in
Michigan, ``I think Dick has to come in first or a real strong
second to remain in the race. ... If we don't do well here, we will
not be able to continue.''
   The Missouri congressman has only until Tuesday to file for
re-election to his House seat, and one aide, commenting only on
condition he not be named, suggested that it was important for the
congressman to retain that office in order to raise money. His
campaign has been strapped for cash for weeks.
   Money was in the news for several other current and former
candidates on Thursday:
   _Gore's campaign confirmed Thursday it borrowed more than $1.4
million early this month, putting up collateral that included
future matching funds and a personal guarantee by the candidate
himself.
   The move followed a report in the Nashville Tennessean newspaper
about the details of Gore's borrowing.
   _The Federal Election Commission said that Gary Hart, now that
he is no longer a presidential candidate, can use leftover 1988
campaign funds toward retiring his lingering debt of about $1
million from his 1984 race.
   _The FEC agreed to grant federal matching funds to political
extremist Lyndon LaRouche's presidential campaign, even though he
is standing trial on a charge relating to alleged financial
irregularity in his 1984 campaign. LaRouche is running as a
Democrat, although the national party has disavowed his candidacy.
   The Democrats, including Gephardt, were concentrating on
Michigan and on Wisconsin, which has its primary on April 5.
   Dukakis, who spent the first part of the week trading charges
with Gephardt on foreign-trade policy, a major issue in a state
heavily dependent on U.S. auto sales, was in California but planned
to spend all day Friday in Michigan. The Detroit Free Press
endorsed him on Thursday.
   Dole's aides said he had no campaign events scheduled Thursday.
   Pat Robertson, meanwhile, urged 700 supporters in Falls Church,
Va. to turn out in force at local Republican precinct meetings to
select delegates to the state and natonal GOP conventions.
   Noting that Easter is ten days away, Robertson said the press
declared his candidacy dead after Super Tuesday. ``I don't think
they are aware of the Resurrection,'' he said.
   ``In the next few weeks, as these caucuses unfold, we are going
to win the majority of delegates in the Republican Party in
Virginia,'' predicted Robertson, who was beaten soundly by Bush in
his home state's non-binding primry on March 8.

Ships</HEAD>

   The United States belittled Soviet technology
for detecting nuclear missiles aboard ships and snubbed an
invitation this week to see the process before the May 29-June 2
summit meeting in Moscow, a senior U.S. official said Thursday.
   During three days of pre-summit talks in Washington this week,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze offered to let the
United States participate in an experiment to test the system in
April.
   Meanwhile, the United States offered some new proposals of its
own regarding space-based weapons systems.
   One was the exemption of spy satellites from treaty
restrictions, an idea that the Soviets apparently found interesting.
   ``We think they're useful to our security,'' a senior
administration official said Thursday. ``They think they're useful
to theirs.''
   The other idea was that U.S. and Soviet negotiators make a
special effort to define space-based testing and deployment.
   ``Then we could also work on the idea of having
confidence-building measures or what we call predictability
measures which could reduce the difficulties between the two sides
with respect to other types of systems that might be tested or
other kinds of devices,'' the official said.
   Details of that proposal have not been settled, but officials
said the most likely approach would be to allow only a limited
number of space weapons prototypes to be tested in a region of
space where they would have little value in an actual missile
defense.
   The two proposals were intended to resolve the contentious
battle over the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, known also as
Star Wars, which is possibly the biggest obstacle to reaching
agreement to cut long-range nuclear weapons.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Wednesday that the two
issues would be negotiated separately but that agreements in the
two areas should be ``completed more or less at the same time so
the two things move in parallel.'' The United States has long said
that the two issues should be handled separately.
   Shevardnadze, meanwhile, said Wednesday night that ``of course
there is'' a linkage between resolving the defense in space issues
and the treaty to reduce long-range strategic weapons.
   ``There will be no treaty on the 50 percent reduction in
strategic offensive arms if there is no observance of the ABM
treaty, at least for an agreed period of time,'' Shevardnadze said.
The Soviets, as well as some in Congress, say SDI would violate the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   Shevardnadze hailed the system to detect nuclear missiles on
ships as a technological milestone in missile detection that would
help the superpowers achieve their goal of a summit agreement to
cut long-range nuclear arsenals.
   The senior U.S. official said, however, ``we're not interested''
because the system doesn't detect nuclear sea-launched cruise
missiles, as the Soviets claim.
   ``The Soviets could not explain how this experiment would tell
us more than we already know,'' the official said. ``Such
technology would not be effective under realistic conditions.''
   It could not, for example, tell the difference between nuclear
warheads and atomic propulsion systems used on many surface ships,
the official said.
   ``Our people know a great deal about the ideas that the Soviets
have advanced, and we've looked into it carefully,'' the official
said.
   When they agreed in principle last December to hold a springtime
summit in Moscow, President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev said they wanted to sign an agreement to cut the numbers
of long-range nuclear missiles and bombers by 30 percent to 50
percent.
   With little progress _ notably on the verification issues _
during Shevardnadze's visit to Washington for three days this week,
neither side predicted the agreement would be ready in time.
   The senior U.S. official said, moreover, that until the
negotiators prove they can verify elimination of the various types
of weapons involved, they won't know which ones will be covered in
a treaty.
   Another official, noting that the two nations also disagree on
such explosive issues as Afghanistan, the Middle East, Central
America and human rights warned against expecting ``easy
solutions'' to U.S.-Soviet problems.
   The official described the most recent talks as ``grueling,''
notably in the 11 hours of discussion on the regional hot spots.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater sought to dispel
suggestions that the summit meeting _ in the twilight of Reagan's
presidency _ would be a ceremonial and symbolic visit short on
substantive accomplishments.
   During Shevardnadze's talks in Washington ``we made enough
progress to keep going and presumably we will make more in the days
ahead,'' the spokesman told reporters.
   During the talks this week both sides ``faced all the tough
problems'' and left no confusion about where both sides stand, he
said.
   The summit ``will be well prepared; there will be substance to
discuss; there will be good prospects for success,'' Fitzwater said.

   U.S.-Soviet talks on the Middle East were
extended Thursday while Arabs and Israelis continued to delay a
response to an American plan for negotiations.
   Vladimir Polyakov, a specialist in the Soviet Foreign Ministry,
met with Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy despite
what U.S. officials described as a fundamental difference in the
two superpowers' positions.
   The Soviets are seeking an active role in any peace conference,
while Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Wednesday night he
did not want any interference in Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   ``It's quite clear the Soviet concept of how to go about this is
really sharply different from ours,'' Shultz told reporters after
three days of talks with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir also objects to an active
Soviet role, but King Hussein of Jordan is seeking Soviet
participation in the negotiations.
   Shevardnadze left Polyakov behind to continue the discussions
with Murphy and flew home to Moscow. U.S. envoy Philip C. Habib,
meanwhile, completed talks in Amman with Hussein and returned to
Washington to report to Shultz.
   Shultz said that despite having no direct reply from the
Israelis or Arabs to his plan to open negotiations by May 1 he
would not give up.
   ``We will continue to work with the parties directly involved,
and we will continue to try, in every way we can, to find our way
to the direct, face-to-face negotiations that we believe are the
only way in which you can really resolve these issues,'' he said.
   ``Now how to get there is difficult, and we will continue to
push for and, at the same time, maintain the limitations on the
kind of conference we've called for. And, we'll just have to see
how that goes.''
   Shultz said ``nobody seems to be ready to climb on our
bandwagon, including the Soviet Union. On the other hand, everybody
wants to keep it rolling, so we'll keep it rolling.''
   Asked if he planned to return to the Middle East, Shultz said he
had not made a decision. He said his lengthy talks with
Shevardnadze had made it difficult for him ``to come up for air''
and evaluate reports from the region.
   Shultz presented his plan for negotiations to Arab and Israeli
leaders three weeks ago and asked for a reply by mid-March.
   ``I am ready to go to the Middle East anytime it seems as though
there is even a remote chance of being constructive,'' Shultz said.
``I don't have to have a high probability.''
   The U.S. plan excludes the Palestine Liberation Organization
from proposed negotiations but provides for a joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
   Meantime Thursday, Murphy told the House Appropriations
subcommittee on foreign operations ``it's a tough question but I
don't think it's insuperable'' to find a credible Palestinian
leader to participate without driving Israel away from the
bargaining table.
   Murphy added that the PLO ``remains for Palestinians, by and
large, the only leadership they accept.'' But he did not say a
Palestinian participant would necessarily have to be a PLO
representative.
   Five demonstrators wearing T-shirts reading ``Stop U.S. Aid to
Israel'' stood silently against a hearing room wall throughout most
of Murphy's testimony and left without incident after about an hour.
   Murphy said ``it would be the dangerous to the peace process''
for the United States to reduce its annual payment of $2.2 billion
in military and economic aid to Israel to protest its handling of
Palestinian unrest on the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   The State Department official said any such aid reduction might
be interpreted in Arab capitals as a weakening of ties between the
United States and Israel and might invite a renewal of military
assaults against the Jewish state.
   Under questioning, Murphy said the United States had assurances
from ``the highest levels'' in Saudi Arabia and China that the
medium-range missiles that China recently agreed to provide to the
Saudis contain conventional and not nuclear warheads.
   The Washington Post reported in Friday's editions that the
Israeli Air Force has been conducting unusually intensive low-level
bombing practice runs at the same time Saudi Arabia is digging in
its new missiles.
   The newspaper quoted U.S. intelligence officials as saying that
the bombing could be in preparation for a pre-emptive strike
against the missiles, as a senior Israeli official warned Sunday.
However, the officials said they had no hard evidence that an
Israeli strike was imminent.
   Satellite photography and other intelligence have revealed that
Israel has been flying F-15 fighter bombers in attack profiles and
that Saudi Arabia has been building shelters for its missiles, the
Post reported.
   Saudi Arabia has sent a warning through the United States that
it will retaliate with its surviving missiles with a range of up to
1,500 miles if Israel tries to bomb its missiles, diplomatic
sources told the newspaper.

   Nearly all of Charleston's police
officers and firefighters called in sick Thursday to protest a 2
percent pay raise, then ignored back-to-work orders from a judge
and the City Council.
   Less than an hour before an emergency council meeting Thursday
afternoon, Kanawha County Circuit Judge Patrick Casey issued a
temporary injunction ordering firefighters to work immediately and
police to report at their next scheduled shift.
   The missing police officers did not report for the 3 p.m. shift,
however, and firefighters also refused to report.
   ``We just want an honest living,'' said Fire Department Lt. Walt
Cavender, who was on duty at the city's station No. 1. ``We're
going backward in pay.''
   The ``blue flu'' in West Virginia's capital and largest city
began Wednesday night when officers began refusing to show up for
work.
   At the 6 a.m. shift change, 16 of 17 uniformed police officers
and 42 of 44 firefighters scheduled to report failed to show up.
   Firemen and police officers who were on duty overnight were
retained on overtime, giving the fire department a full complement
of men, and process servers took return-to-work orders to the
absent personnel Thursday afternoon, said Mayor Chuck Gardner.
   Gardner declared a state of civil emergency earlier in the day,
saying the policemen and firefighters must return because ``the
safety of the citizens of Charleston is not a bargaining chip.''
   Police Chief Ed Garnett told an emergency meeting of the city
council that only 13 officers, covering all grades, showed up
Thursday morning, ``most of them supervisors.'' He said only three
cars were on patrol Thursday morning, with two officers in each car.
   Garnett also told the council members that since Wednesday night
68 officers and 42 firemen had called in sick as of 9 a.m.
   The city budget, approved Monday night, includes appropriations
for 165 policemen, 147 firefighters and 10 paramedics for the city
of 63,000.
   Garnett said the firefighters who were on the job had been there
since 8 a.m. Wednesday and were tiring quickly.
   ``I don't know how long they can stay there,'' he said.
   The council unanimously suspended the city's sick-leave policy,
meaning that any more officers calling in sick would have to have a
doctor's excuse to get paid for any additional days absent from
work.
   Gardner, facing his first crisis since taking over as mayor four
months ago, said it wasn't illegal to call the council into
emergency session on less than four hours' notice and suspend
sections of the city code. The code requires two days' notice of
emergency meetings.
   No police or firefighters picketed Thursday, but about 20 police
wives marched in front of City Hall and carried signs. Passing
motorists honked their horns in support and some _ aware that
patrols were down _ took the opportunity to run red lights.
   ``We have several police officers that qualify for welfare,''
said police wife Val Lockard.
   Kanawha County Sheriff Danny Jones said his department would
provide assistance to the city only ``if there's a murder or
something.''
   ``We don't have the manpower to work the city,'' Jones said.
   State police Superintendent W.F. Donohoe said Gardner had asked
the governor for state police help. ``We will answer calls on a
priority basis to the very best of our ability,'' Donohoe said.
   The police officers believe their 2 percent raise will be eaten
up by a higher deductible on their health insurance and an increase
in the city's incinerator fee from $30 to $85.
   ``It's not easy to raise the incinerator fee. But without a
raise in the incinerator fee, we didn't have money to increase
salaries,'' said Councilwoman Maggie McCoy.
   Under the budget approved this week, salaries for uniformed
police officers range from $27,673 for a captain with 20 years'
experience to $18,589 for a patrol officer with three years'
experience.
   Mayoral Aide Ed Esposito said that no raises had been given this
year but that police and firefighters had received a 3 percent
raise in the 1986-87 fiscal year and raises totaling 8 percent over
the past five years.
   By comparison, at the Kanawha County Sheriff's Department, where
deputies have gotten raises totaling 25 percent over the past 3{
years, a deputy with three years' experience will make $21,720 as
of July 1, Jones said.
   City firefighters' pay ranges from $27,673 for an assistant fire
chief with 20 years' experience to $18,409 for a first-year
firefighter.

   Neil Kinnock, leader of Britain's opposition Labor
Party, will be challenged for the post by veteran leftist Tony Benn
at the party conference in the fall, a Labor coalition said
Wednesday.
   The Campaign Group, composed of about 40 leftist party
lawmakers, said Kinnock's deputy, moderate Roy Hattersley, will be
challenged by leftist Eric Heffer.
   The announcement came after a meeting of the party's national
executive committee.
   Kinnock, 46, and Hattersley are considered not as left wing as
Benn and Heffer.
   Benn, 62, a former Cabinet minister, has accused Kinnock of
watering down socialism after the party's three defeats in nine
years by the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Kinnock and Hattersley have worked for a united party and
cracked down on militants in hopes of making a broader appeal to
voters. They say a leadership contest will distract the party from
opposing the government.
   Kinnock and Hattersley denounced the challenge in a joint
statement as ``futile and selfish'' and predicted ``massive
defeat'' for Benn and Heffer.
   Benn told reporters: ``Democracy is about choice.''
   Heffer said: ``The time has come for a crusade for socialism.
The working people of this country are getting a worse and worse
deal.''

   A state appeals court Wednesday rejected as
too low a $3,500 damage award to a salesman left with a perpetual
frown after an auto accident.
   ``Such scars are of a greater consequence to a 24-year-old
single man who has chosen a career in sales than that amount
reflects,'' a two-judge panel ruled in ordering a new trial on the
issue of damages for Robert Tronolone.
   Tronolone was a passenger in a car that struck a utility pole in
Bridgewater Township.
   A jury found the driver, Peter Palmer, negligent and awarded
Tronolone $750, but the judge at the trial found it inadequate and
raised it to $3,500. Tronolone appealed.

   Gunmen ambushed and killed on
Wednesday the security chief for a newspaper that had urged the
government not to back down in its war on drug traffickers, police
said.
   Jorge Alberto Stefan Gomez was hit by five bullets fired by
three men on motorcycles, police said in a news release. His
10-month-old daughter was grazed by a bullet and hospitalized in
satisfactory condition, police said.
   Colombia's Council of State meanwhile ordered the temporary
suspension of arrest orders for five members of the Medellin
cartel, a group said to dominate cocaine trafficking in Colombia.
   The suspension of the arrest orders Wednesday is almost certain
to bring an angry reaction from U.S. authorities, who have begun to
question the Colombian government's position on rounding up drug
traffickers.
   Stefan and family were waiting for a taxi near their home when
three men on motorcycles opened fire with pistols and a submachine
gun, the police said. His wife was not hurt.
   Police said they didn't know who was responsible for Stefan's
killing.
   Stefan was chief of security for Medellin's El Colombiano
newspaper, which has urged the government not to give in to drug
traffickers. He also served as security chief for the newspaper's
publisher, Juan Gomez Martinez, who was elected mayor on March 13.
Gomez takes office June 1.
   On March 10, two bombs were thrown from a speeding car into the
entryway of El Colombiano. A guard threw the bombs back into the
street and a passer-by was killed.
   In November, gunmen shot up Gomez's home. The gunmen apparently
were trying to kidnap Gomez in an attempt to get the government to
suspend extraditions of Colombians to the United States to face
drug trafficking charges.
   Many drug traffickers live and process cocaine base in Medellin.
   Colombian drug traffickers have killed a justice minister, an
attorney general, 21 judges, two newspaper editors and scores of
policemen and soldiers in the last four years.
   The suspension of arrest orders for the Medellin cartel was
announced by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Buitrago, a member of the
Council of State.
   The Justice Ministry in January ordered the arrest of alleged
Medellin cartel members Pablo Escobar, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha and
three brothers, Jorge Luis Ochoa, Juan David Ochoa and Fabio Ochoa.
   Buitrago, making the announcement during an interview by the
Bogota radio station Caracol, said the arrest orders were being
suspended while the government studies possible charges in Colombia
against the five men.
   Buitrago said the suspension of the arrest orders is temporary
until the council decides if it will permanently cancel the orders.
It could be up to two months before the council makes its final
decision.
   Meanwhile, Escobar's wife and 25 of his guards appeared before a
judge in Medellin after a shootout at Escobar's home near that
northwest Colombian city.
   Escobar apparently was at home when the shootout began but
escaped. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says Escobar is
among the world's biggest cocaine traffickers. He is wanted for
trial in the United States.
   Army troops surrounded the Escobar home Tuesday, setting off a
sophisticated alarm system of sirens and flashing lights, the
army's 4th Brigade headquarters in Medellin said in a news release.
   A gunbattle ensued, and one Escobar guard was wounded, the army
said.
   The army found numerous guns, lots of ammunition and
sophisticated communications equipment, the Colombian radio chain
RCN said.
   Escobar's wife, Maria Victoria Henao de Escobar, was released by
the Medellin judge, RCN said, quoting a source with the attorney
general's office.

   Two New Mexico State University history
professors said Wednesday that government documents indicate Army
intelligence officers attempted to kill Mexican revolutionary
Pancho Villa by poisoning in 1916.
   Charles H. Harris III and Louis Sadler presented the findings in
a paper submitted at a monthly meeting of the Latin American
studies forum at New Mexico State.
   They said the attempt came during an American expedition into
Mexico in pursuit of Villa and his men. The expedition followed a
raid by Villa on the New Mexico community of Columbus that left 17
American soldiers and civilians dead.
   The attempt was made in the town of Jimenez, Mexico, four months
after the raid on Columbus, according to Sadler and Harris.
   The plot called for two Japanese men who were employed as secret
agents for the American government to put poison in a cup of coffee
intended for Villa, the professors said.
   The two agents posed as peddlers and wanted Villa to think they
were sympathetic to his revolutionary cause. Villa foiled the
assassination attempt by pouring part of the coffee into another
man's cup, the professors said.
   The fate of the man into whose cup Villa poured the coffee was
not known, the professors said. The poison was supposed to be
odorless and tasteless and cause death three days after ingestion.
   Historians consider the Columbus raid a turning point in the
Mexican revolution because it rallied American public opinion
against Villa and his men. Gen. John J. Pershing led the
retaliatory expedition.
   ``We can't prove it but there is no doubt in my mind that he
knew'' of the plot, Sadler said.
   The professors said that while there were official inquiries
into the alleged plot, Pershing denied any knowledge of it. The
assassination attempt, according to the professors, was covered up.

   The telling and retelling of a story of rape and
murder from various points of view makes for little suspense, but
good acting and direction keep up interest in an off-Broadway
revival of the 1959 stage version of ``Rashomon.''
   The play by Fay and Michael Kanin is based on the 1951 Japanese
movie of the same name and on stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa
published in 1915.
   It is the story of a samurai and his wife who encounter a bandit
in the forest. The wife is raped and the samurai is found dead. But
the circumstances vary depending on who does the telling.
   Knowing the rape and death will be depicted several times, the
audience can focus on how each person tells the story to paint
himself or herself to best advantage.
   The husband's ghost, conjured up in a courtroom, tells of
suicide, while the bandit and the wife both confess to murder. The
bandit figures he'll be executed anyway; the wife thinks she'll be
pardoned. It would shame them more to be publicly revealed as
lacking in the personality they've presented to the world than to
proclaim that they were driven to kill.
   The final version, told by a woodcutter who witnessed the
encounter from a hiding place, is hilarious as husband and wife
bicker and the honorable samurai and daring bandit are afraid to
fight.
   The entire cast is Asian in this first major revival of the play
since it played on Broadway in 1959 starring Claire Bloom, Rod
Steiger, Noel Willman and Oscar Homolka.
   The cast includes James Saito as the bandit who turns
somersaults during swordfights; Kiya Ann Joyce, who can take on
many womanly aspects depending whose story she is acting; Philip
Moon, who usually is bound and gagged as the husband; Peter
Yoshida, the woodcutter, and Thom Sesma, a priest.
   David Leong expertly directed fights and movement. Mina
Albergo's setting is a forest clearing, alabaster with bamboo-leaf
tracings, with the Rashomon Gate at one side. The set enhances the
openness with which director Robert Kalfin places this ``Rashomon''
before the audience. The play will run through May 8.

   President Joaquin
Balaguer will leave for the United States Thursday, where he will
meet with President Reagan and discuss this nation's $4 billion
foreign debt, officials said.
   Foreign Minister Donald Reid Cabral told a news conference
Balaguer also is expected to discuss the U.S. sugar quota with
Reagan Friday.
   Balaguer will meet with International Monetary Fund and World
Bank officials while in Washington, the minister said Wednesday
night.
   He said the president will have his eyes checked in Boston
before returning home. The 80-year-old president suffers from
glaucoma and is nearly blind.
   Balaguer, elected to his fifth four-year term of office 19
months ago, is seeking to find ways to turn the Dominican
Republic's economy around.
   He announced a 25 percent increase in the minimum wage this
month following riots that left five people dead and 20 injured.
   Last year, the government paid around $700 million to service
its foreign debt.
   Officials in Santo Domingo say part of the reason for this
Caribbean nation's economic slump is the cut in the U.S. quota for
Dominican sugar, this nation's most important export.
   The U.S. quota for Dominican sugar now is 160,000 tons compared
to 525,000 tons in 1983.
   U.S. aid to the Dominican Republic is $150 million. The republic
also receives an additional $35 million annually in surplus food.
   Traveling with Balaguer will be the U.S. ambassador to the
Dominican Republic, Lowell Kilday, and 10 government officials,
according to Reid Cabral. Balaquer will stay at the home of the
Dominican ambassador, Jose Leon Asencio, while in Washington.

   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will

unravel disagreements over the next nine weeks, they will sign a
sweeping pact to cut long-range nuclear weapons.
   ``I wouldn't want to lay you odds,'' Secretary of State George
P. Shultz said on the chances of reaching agreement in time.
   The road to the summit is also littered with divisions on
Central America, the Middle East, and above all, Afghanistan, where

   Although U.S. sanctions and a general
strike have devastated Panama's economy, opposition leaders said it
may take another mutiny in the military to drive Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega from power.
   As the strike entered its fourth day today, a prominent
opposition leader was expected to return to join in the fight to
oust Noriega, the country's de facto leader and head of its
15,000-strong Defense Forces.
   Almost all businesses were shut down across the country again
Wednesday. Lacking food and money, thousands of people lined up at
soup kitchens set up by churches throughout the country.
   Also Wednesday, the government ordered a U.S. diplomat expelled,
but the State Department said in Washington that economics
counselor David Miller would not leave as demanded. The State
Department said it would ignore the order because it considers
Panamana's current government illegitimate.

   Lawmakers are crediting the budget summit
accord between congressional leaders and the White House for the
bipartisan ease with which the House sent a $1.1 trillion budget
for fiscal 1989 to the Senate.
   The spending plan, which alters some of the domestic priorities
President Reagan had included in his own proposed package last
month, was approved 319-102 on Wednesday by the
Democratic-controlled House. In contrast to last year, when budget
writers toiled several weeks longer amid staunch opposition by
Republicans, GOP lawmakers this time voted 92-78 for the resolution.
   ``I think it would have been impossible without the summit,''
Rep. Delbert Latta of Ohio, ranking Republican on the House Budget
Committee, said afterward.

criminal conspiracy and defrauded the government of $17 million.
   One by one, the defendants were called before U.S. District
Judge Gerhard Gesell at their arraignment, and asked by courtroom
clerk Barbara Montgomery, ``How do you wish to plead?''
   ``Not guilty,'' replied Poindexter, President Reagan's former
national security adviser; North, a top assistant to Poindexter;
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord; and Albert Hakim,
who controlled the money and procured the arms for the once-secret
Iran-Contra operation.
   All four defendants were released on their personal recognizance
and told to report weekly by telephone to a pre-trial agency.
Although criminal defendants are often asked to surrender their
passports, Gesell said he would not impose that condition.

   The Kremlin laid out an 8-year plan Thursday night
to pacify a Caucasus region shaken by ethnic strife. At the same
time, army helicopters were reported circling over the Armenian
capital to prevent further unrest.
   The carrot-and-stick approach seemed aimed at cooling feelings
inflamed by a noisy Armenian campaign to annex the region of
Nagorno-Karabakh from neighboring Azerbaijan and to warn Armenian
activists to end their protests.
   Activists have said specifically that government efforts to
improve poor economic and social conditions of Armenians in the
Caucasus mountain region near the Soviet border with Iran would not
meet their demands.

   City inspectors extorted hundreds of thousands
of dollars from restaurants by threatening to cite them for
health-code violations, turning the Department of Health into a
``Department of Wealth,'' authorities said Thursday.
   About 300 of New York City's 15,000 restaurants were victimized,
from fast-food establishments to little ethnic places to some tony
Manhattan spots, authorities said. The FBI said the restaurants
were in all five boroughs.
   Twenty-eight people, including health inspectors, supervisors
and former Health Department employees acting as middlemen, shared
the extortion money, the authorities said.

   Time after time, the big jackrabbit avoids
attacks by the five Harris hawks that dive and feint with the
precision of a military unit. But finally, the rabbit is exhausted
and a powerful talon slashes quickly. The hunt ends and winged
predators feed together.
   In a report to be published Friday in Science magazine,
biologist James C. Bednarz said he repeatedly witnessed such
coordinated hunting by Harris hawks. It is, he said, the first
documented proof that hawks are able to organize and cooperate with
almost human skill in such a complex series of manuevers.
   ``People have suggested it in the past, but this is the first
documentation of it,'' said Bednarz, who is director of higher
education research at the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in Kempton, Pa.,
and an associate professor at the University of New Mexico.

<HEAD>`Designing Women' Creator Writes Entire Season of Episodes</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Watching the opening credits on the season
finale of CBS' ``Designing Women'' Monday night will be something
akin to witnessing the final out in a no-hitter.
   When the ``written by'' card goes up on the screen, it will say
``Linda Bloodworth-Thomason'' _ just as it has on every one of the
22 episodes this season.
   Bloodworth-Thomason is the first person in television history to
single-handedly write every episode of a show for a whole season, a
feat for which she has been nominated for inclusion in The Guinness
Book of World Records.
   She said in a telephone interview that she wrote each script in
a marathon session on the Sunday before shooting began the
following week.
   ``We've never been one script ahead, which is kind of
harrowing,'' she said. ``It's kind of like walking a tightrope each
week without a net. This is what would give the network a heart
attack.''
   Not only did she write all the scripts, but all the scripts were
unusually good _ not formula sitcom fare, but thoughtful essays on
such diverse subjects as AIDS or the ordination of women.
   In Monday's episode, ``Reservations for Eight,'' the women are
stranded in a ski lodge with their boyfriends for what turns out to
be a tour-de-force battle of the sexes.
   Bloodworth-Thomason says no matter what subject she takes on,
the network has not interfered.
   ``They have never, ever told me anything that I cannot do. They
have never disapproved of any subject I've wanted to do. I just
decide what I want to write about and I write it. There has been
zero censorship.
   ``It's 23 minutes of prime-time television every week to address
any topic I want,'' she said. ``I've tried to be responsible and
fair, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I put my personal opinions
in. I do get my own propaganda in, but that's what I think makes it
interesting. My big complaint about television is the characters
are too homogenized. You don't know where they go to church or how
they feel about issues. Our women all are very, very opinionated.''
   Bloodworth-Thomason grew up in Poplar Bluff, Mo., in a
ideologically rambunctious family, where, she recalled with a
laugh, ``If you didn't have an opinion you got sent to your room.''
   ``I like stirring things up. Everyone in my family is an
attorney. My grandfather, all my uncles, my brother, my father.
Even when I was little, he (her father) would come in and say, `You
know, girls aren't all that smart.' I would cry and say, `They are,
too!' He knew what he was doing. He would always make me defend my
positions.''
   Bloodworth-Thomason and her husband, Harry Thomason, a one-time
high school football coach from Arkansas, are co-executive
producers of ``Designing Women,'' and Thomason directs many of the
episodes.
   Bloodworth-Thomason created the show specifically for Annie
Potts, Jean Smart, Dixie Carter and Delta Burke, the latter two of
whom starred in Bloodworth-Thomason's viciously funny but
short-lived ``Filthy Rich.'' With ``Designing Women,''
Bloodworth-Thomason aimed to make a show about smart Southern women.
   The show was a hit as soon as it premiered last season, though
CBS almost killed it by repeatedly changing its time period,
sparking an almost unprecedented outcry by fans. The show has
finally settled into Monday night.
   Bloodworth-Thomason, whose first script, for ``M-A-S-H,'' won an
Emmy, never doubted that a show about a bunch of wise-cracking
Southern belles would succeed.
   ``I'm one of these people that's always optimistic,'' she said.
``I always think everything's going to work out just like I want it
to.''
   She laughed, then added, ``That makes it all the more poignant
when I'm flattened out like a cartoon character when the
steamroller has run over me.''
   Bloodworth-Thomason expects to hire a writing staff for next
season, since she and her husband are producing a new series for
MTM, and she is writing the script for Bette Midler's new movie
about an all-woman band in the 1930s.
   She said Midler had seen ``Designing Women,'' called her up and
asked, ``Can you make my mouth move like Dixie Carter's?''

<HEAD>Infrastructure Problems Loom for Los Angeles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's second-largest city, with its
promised-land image of youth and opportunity, is starting to show
its age. The effects of too many years of too much growth are
increasingly evident in Los Angeles' streets and freeways, sewers
and landfills.
   While in many U.S. cities the challenge is just to replace
public works as they wear out, Los Angeles faces the added
pressures of California-style growth.
   The stress has occasionally popped the city's overworked sewer
system, causing raw sewage discharges into the Pacific Ocean and
prompting Mayor Tom Bradley last fall to propose restrictions on
the number of new sewer hookups.
   On the region's streets and freeways, daily trips will increase
42 percent by the year 2010, according to a local planning agency.
Motorists' average speed of 31 mph systemwide today is expected to
drop to 11 mph.
   And without more landfills, city and county officials say Los
Angeles will produce thousands of tons more garbage daily than it
can properly dispose.
   ``Our infrastructure has reached the point that it requires
massive infusions of resources to maintain, or to increase its
capacity to deal with the population growth,'' said Edward J.
Avila, president of the city's Board of Public Works.
   ``I think Los Angeles has been lulled into a false sense of
security,'' said Delwin A. Biagi, an engineer who joined the city's
public works department 17 years ago and who now heads the bureau
of sanitation.
   The city population is expected to swell 16 percent, to 3.6
million, by 2010, according to the Southern California Association
of Governments. In the surrounding six-county area, the predicted
growth is 47 percent, to 18.3 million people in 22 years.
   ``Over the next 25 years, we see a 50 percent increase in
housing and jobs in the Los Angeles area,'' said Roger Riga, a SCAG
transportation planner. ``That means it's going to cause some big
problems with our transportation system. It's already overburdened.
We know that. The question is what are we going to do about it?''
   Riga's agency, which predicted the growth in traffic, also
prepared a study in February that sets out three alternatives,
ranging in cost from $42 million to $110 million, to alleviate
congestion: by locating jobs nearer to housing through growth
management, or changing driving patterns by carpooling or
re-scheduling office hours, or constructing new highways and other
facilities.
   However, California Department of Transportation officials say
the problems are so intractable that doubling the number of
freeways would not appreciably reduce traffic.
   Moreover, a statewide study done by the Governor's
Infrastructure Review Task Force indicates the pricetag would be
billions _ not millions _ of dollars. The task force estimated the
state's public works needs at $78 billion _ and projected a revenue
shortfall of $50 billion to meet the demand.
   Increasing traffic and other effects of growth have stoked the
political fires of Los Angeles' anti-growth movement, said Laura
Lake, an adjunct faculty member at UCLA's School of Public Health,
who heads a group called Not Yet New York.
   ``All the people who support slow-growth want to make sure that
the infrastructure will still be there,'' Ms. Lake said. ``The
system is hemorrhaging and they're coming up with very expensive
Band-Aids.''
   Her group supported City Council candidate Ruth Galanter last
year, and the growth-control advocate was elected. Ms. Lake herself
plans to run for a council seat in 1989.
   Local concerns reflect a nationwide problem.
   Last August, a study of public works funding done for the U.S.
Senate concluded: ``As the federal government shifted priorities
away from infrastructure financing, new federal laws have mandated
state and local compliance with new requirements for water
pollution control, clean drinking water and the cleanup of
hazardous wastes.''
   Another federal study concluded that as much as $90 billion a
year is needed to pay for all types of public works repairs
nationwide.
   The problems it identified _ neglected and dilapidated bridges,
water systems, highways, mass transit systems and other facilities
_ are consistent with what is happening in Los Angeles County,
Supervisor Mike Antonovich said recently.
   Yet Los Angeles leaders postponed capital improvements to the
sewer system for more than a decade while arguing over compliance
with federal clean water standards.
   ``The city was running away from its responsibilities,'' said
Dorothy Green, president of an environmental group called Heal the
Bay.
   The dispute ended when the city agreed to stop dumping its
treated sewage sludge offshore and to build a secondary wastewater
treatment facility. The primary wastewater plant was built in 1950.
   The cost of compliance will be more than $2.3 billion over the
next 10 years, officials said.
   Los Angeles also faces a looming crisis over its garbage, which
is thrown away at the rate of 45,000 tons per day in the
metropolitan area, said Mike Miller, manager of the city's solid
waste task force.
   The city itself, which generates 18,000 tons per day of that
total, already trucks 5,400 tons per day to outlying county
landfills, Miller said.
   ``We have to find additional landfill space and we have to start
recycling efforts,'' Miller said. ``That's all we've got.''
   If no landfills are established, the excess garbage will amount
to 6,400 tons per day by 1992, and 50,000 tons per day by the year
2000, Miller said. By 1997, there will be no landfills remaining
within the city.
   ``We haven't been able to site a new landfill since 1974,''
Miller said, listing five ill-fated proposals, including
trash-to-energy incineration plants.
   ``The City Council is very aware of the situation. They just
have no clear-cut plan as to what they're going to do.''

   At age 15, Mickey Hays has appeared in a
feature-length movie, has learned to hunt and to ride an off-road
motorcycle, and has traveled and made a lot of friends.
   ``If I die today, I feel like I've had a good life,'' says the
boy, who suffers from progeria, a rare condition that has caused
his diminutive body to age far beyond his years.
   Most children with progeria die before reaching their teens,
usually of a stroke or heart-related cause.
   Experts say the condition strikes one in 8 million children, and
only about 70 cases have ever been reported. Only 15 or so people
are alive today who suffer from the disease, thought to be caused
by a genetic pituitary disorder, according to Baylor University
Medical Center's Dr. Geoff Sherwood.
   And yet, except for the fact that he doesn't go to school,
Mickey tries to be a typical teen-ager. His life is an ongoing
defiance of the odds and medical convention about his condition.
   ``When they first told my parents about progeria, they said I
wouldn't live more than a month,'' Mickey says of the time at age 4
when doctors finally put a name on the condition that had hardened
his skin and caused his hair to fall out.
   ``They keep pushing it back. When I was 5, they said 7. When I
was 7, they said 10. When I was 10, they said 12. Now I'm 15, and
they say 18.''
   It's gotten so that Mickey doesn't listen anymore and visits a
physician just once a year for a checkup.
   ``I feel fine. I feel great,'' he said in a recent interview in
his rural Longview home.
   Two years ago, Mickey suffered congestive heart failure brought
on by progeria, but now his only disability seems to be that
sunshine or other bright light hurts his eyes.
   Still, he didn't let the sun keep him from going on a
church-sponsored youth trip to a water park in Dallas, 100 miles
away, or from being outside with friends. He simply wears a cap.
   As he nears his 16th birthday on June 30, Mickey looks forward
to a rite of passage: obtaining a driver's license and a pickup
truck _ ``a jet black Nissan hardbody,'' he says.
   Extenders attached to the controls of his mother's van helped
Mickey, who is only 3 feet tall, learn to drive. But like many of
his friends, Mickey drives his own four-wheel motorcycle through
the piney woods that surround his home.
   ``Just about everybody has motorcycles and four-wheelers,''
Mickey explains. ``There's a hill everybody goes to called `The
Mountain.' It's the highest point in Gregg County and from there
you can look down on Longview. It's real nice.''
   Over pizza, two of Mickey's friends, Holly Santos and Kim Head,
talked about rock concerts they've attended with him in Shreveport,
La., and Dallas. They teased him about new cowboy boots and about
not attending school.
   ``I'd stay in school just to be around everybody,'' Holly said.
   But Mickey, who would be in 10th grade, doesn't attend classes:
``I quit after seventh grade. I got in too much trouble. I didn't
like being told to shut up.''
   When his friends are in school, Mickey spends his days working
on his four-wheeler, hunting in season (he has bagged five deer and
16 raccoons), watching soap operas, listening to pop musicians
Tiffany and Whitesnake, and playing with his toddler brother, Jared.
   He mows yards for neighbors and occasionally works in his mother
Cindy Wilkerson's income tax preparation office and his stepfather
Larry Wilkerson's business machine outlet.
   ``There's always a way to make money,'' Mickey said, adding that
his favorite way would be to work in show business again.
   He played a gentle old visitor from space in ``The Aurora
Encounter,'' a 1985 feature-length movie, and now envisions a part
in a credit card commercial:
   ``Do you know me?'' he would ask. ``I'm not an alien who visited
Texas in the 19th century just to be killed by a frightened Texas
Ranger. That's just a movie role I played.''
   Because of the movie part, Mickey says he became ``somebody''
rather than ``somebody different.''
   ``People before always used to notice me as somebody
different,'' Mickey said. ``Now I go somewhere and people recognize
me as Mickey Hays, someone who played in a movie.''
   The role is one of two experiences in recent years that Mickey
said built his self-esteem. The second was meeting Fransie
Geringer, the progeric son of a South African coal miner, in 1982.
It was the first time either boy had met someone else with progeria.
   They met at Disneyland and Mickey later visited Fransie in
Orkney, South Africa. Now, the two have linked with about 15 other
progeric children and many of them started attending an annual
reunion a few years ago.
   Of the progeric children who attend, Mickey said he is the
oldest and possibly the healthiest. A Canadian girl, six months
older than Mickey, died recently, according to his mother.
   ``Mickey and I have had a nice life, but there are times when
you start feeling sorry for yourself,'' Mrs. Wilkerson said. ``If
someone says, `I know how you feel,' well, it's nice, but at the
reunions, other parents really do know how I feel.''
   Mrs. Wilkerson takes pictures of Mickey as an infant, when he
looked like any normal baby, to the reunions to show the other
parents.
   ``They look at Mickey and I and see what's ahead. They really
can't imagine what their children will be like. Mickey being so
outgoing gives them hope.''
   Progeric children should consider themselves very lucky if they
live to age 20, Dr. Sherwood said.
   Still, when the conversation turns to mortality, Mickey speaks
without hesitation of his Baptist upbringing.
   ``I think I'll live as long as God wants me to live. Everybody's
got to die sometime.''

<TEXT>
   Ask Raymond A. Van Houtte what his childhood
ambitions were and it's unlikely that running a couple of arms
companies, practicing law, accounting, teaching or banking would
have appeared on his list.
   Yet Van Houtte, who set out to become an engineer and now heads
a small bank in upstate New York and one of the nation's most
powerful banking trade groups, has done all of them with varying
degrees of success.
   ``I don't think of myself as ambitious. I'm just interested in
many things,'' said Van Houtte, the son of a Detroit grocer. ``If
you ever get the idea you'd like to try something different, do
it.''
   Even now the 63-year-old Van Houtte continues to try on
different hats, so to speak.
   As current president of the New York State Bankers Association,
which represents many of the nation's biggest commercial banks, he
hobnobs with the likes of former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A.
Volcker and other prominent bankers and has lobbied vigorously in
Washington, D.C. and Albany for broader banking powers.
   Van Houtte is one of the most outspoken opponents of the
Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that separates investment
banking from commercial banking, and a similar ``mini
Glass-Steagall'' in New York. He believes the laws eventually will
be repealed and envisions banks offering a wider range of financial
services in the next five years, like a one-stop shopping network.
   If it were up to Van Houtte, banks would be permitted to sell
insurance or underwrite corporate securities but those involved in
risky businesses wouldn't be eligible for deposit insurance.
   At Tompkins County Trust Co., a community bank in a college town
where Van Houtte started out as a director in the mid 1960s, the
small-town granderfatherly image emerges. There, the bank president
of 15 years meets with the local Boy Scouts of America and the
chamber of commerce, two of the many community groups in which he's
been involved.
   Van Houtte knows many of his customers on a first-name basis,
and he's been known to accommodate depositers in need of emergency
cash long after closing hours, something unheard of in a big city.
   Van Houtte, a well-dressed man with whitish hair and a pleasant
smile, recalled his first loan at Tompkins came out of his own
pocket.
   ``I had a young woman who asked me if she could borrow $20 to
buy a dress and get a job at Cornell (University). I said, `A bank
doesn't loan you $20,' so I gave her the $20 myself,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``She bought the dress, came back and showed it
to me.''
   The woman got the job and repaid the loan $5 every two weeks _
``with 6 percent interest,'' he said, betraying his stait-laced
banker's streak.
   ``I never realized I would be a banker. These are things I'm
able to do that make me feel so good,'' Van Houtte said. ``Lawyers
(for instance) don't make things happen. They sometimes prevent
things from happening.''
   His career as a lawyer spanned about 10 years and followed his
stint as a certified public accountant, which overlapped his
teaching and accounting job at the now-defunct Eastern Military
Academy in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., shortly after World War II.
Running two arms companies, Poly-Choke Co. in Hartford, Conn., and
Ithaca Gun Co. in Ithaca, N.Y., came somewhere in between.
   As a young lawyer he specialized in mergers and acquisitions,
but he said he also arranged a few overseas adoptions of babies
abandoned during World War II.
   The pay back then for accounting or law wasn't great, Van Houtte
said, and with a wife and three children to support, including an
infant daughter struggling with a birth defect, he found himself
living from paycheck to paycheck.
   His job at Poly-Choke, which specialized in customized gun
barrels and whose customers included Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower,
``finally gave us enough money so we could afford a two-bedroom
apartment instead of one.'' That job eventually led to Ithaca Gun,
where he served as president from 1966 to 1968.
   These days, Van Houtte and his wife, Margaret, live a
comfortable life in Ithaca, dividing their time between the bank
and community activities. Van Houtte's biggest personal
satisfaction, he says, is in helping families, businesses and
community groups get off the ground financially.
   One of his successes, he said, was arranging for a new home to
be built for the Ladies Union Benevolent Society, a century-old
organization in Ithaca that provides retirement housing for
indigent women.
   ``I really have a wonderful life as a banker,'' he said. ``You
feel good because you've helped people.''
   Next year, Van Houtte plans to retire and is looking forward to
doing a lot more traveling, fishing, gardening and shell
collecting. ``I have a lot of things I'd like to do.''

<HEAD>Jeep Cherokee Limited Is Luxurious Off-roader</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American legend has turned luxurious. Just
look at the 1988 Jeep Cherokee Limited 4-Wheel-Drive. While it
carries the Jeep name _ for years synonymous with ruggedness,
versatility and a certain wilderness-military strength _ this
compact model has many of the same features of expensive European
cars.
   There are the leather, wingback, front bucket seats with six-way
power adjustment _ standard equipment. There is the 18-ounce
carpeting, tinted glass and three-spoke, leather-wrapped steering
wheel _ all standard. And yes, there is the $22,000-plus price tag
for the two-door model, $23,000-plus for four doors.
   Designed with image-conscious buyers in mind, this is no
ordinary Jeep. But then, in a comforting sort of way, it is. Once
in four-wheel-drive, the Jeep Cherokee Limited eagerly takes on
snow, ice, mud, whatever, giving the driver that confidence and
peace of mind that have given Jeep its American legend reputation
and left other vehicles in the ditch.
   The Cherokee, which comes in many versions besides the Limited,
has won several awards since its debut in the 1984 model year. At
that time, it was the first vehicle to be a simultaneous winner by
three four-wheel-drive specialty magazines, Four Wheeler, 4Wheel &
Off Road and Off-Road.
   For the 1988 model year, Cherokee was picked Four Wheeler of the
Year in the sport utility segment by Four Wheeler magazine and 4x4
of the Year by 4Wheel & Off Road magazine.
   It marks the first time a vehicle has repeated as a 4x4
award-winner. With a lineup ranging from a $12,538 four-wheel-drive
version to the upscale Limited, the Cherokee has been a hit with
buyers, too.
   Sales of the four-wheel-drive Cherokees plus four-wheel-drive
Wagoneers _ a larger, top-of-the-line Jeep _ reached a third
consecutive record in the 1987 model year with 110,962 sold. That's
up from 109,929 in the 1986 model year and 97,802 in the 1985 model
year.
   Jeeps are built in the United States as well as China and South
America and are heading for record sales in Europe, according to
Chrysler Corp., which last August bought Jeep-maker American Motors
Corp.
   American buyers of Cherokees have median age of 37-41 with
household income of $50,000-$55,000, said Rita McKay, manager of
Jeep public relations. Sixty percent are college educated.
   The top three reasons buyers give is the four-door availability,
the off-road capability and its alternative to a family car, she
said. Jeep is the only U.S. nameplate to offer a four-door sport
utility vehicle.
   Increasingly, women are the owners and principle drivers of the
vehicles, McKay said, noting a 1987 survey found females accounted
for 40 percent of Cherokee buyers-major drivers.
   Women like the option of going from two-wheel to
four-wheel-drive and not having to fear getting stranded, they like
the interior and they appreciate the good visibility from the
Cherokee's tall profile, McKay explained.
   The test model was impressive in both two-wheel and
four-wheel-drive. A shift lever on the trasnmission console allowed
the driver to choose which was appropriate for road-off-road
conditions.
   The standard, electronic fuel-injected, 4-liter six-cylinder
engine was peppy, mated with the standard four-speed automatic
transmission. The engine is rated at 177 horsepower at 4,500 rpm
and is the most powerful engine of its size in the light-duty truck
market, Chrysler said.
   There was a trade-off in handling, however. While the vehicle
performed superbly off road, the same design that permits such
driving also made for a sometimes bouncy, jostling ride on
pavement, especially at highway speeds on roads where expansion
cracks were uneven.
   Drivers should be aware that sport utility vehicles such as the
Cherokee handle differently from cars. There have been complaints
of rollover accidents, and Chrysler warns in the owner's manual
that the vehicle's higher center of gravity and narrow track affect
handling.
   Drivers should not make sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers that
could lead to loss of control.
   But being seated up high also is advantageous. I could see over
and around most other vehicles and was able to spot traffic
bottlenecks well before I came upon them.
   On the down side, I had to hike up straight skirts to climb into
the Cherokee and it was difficult to emerge gracefully. I wound up
taking a flying leap from the driver seat.
   The rear liftgate was well-designed with washer-wiper that kept
the rear view clear and a door that went up easily, leaving a flat
opening so I didn't have to heave items up and over the back of the
vehicle.
   The leather seats were comfortable and seating, front and back,
was spacious. There were amenities such as front map reading
lights, tilt steering and power antenna.
   But the front vent windows on the test model took a lot of
effort to open. The key would not always come out of the ignition
after I put the shifter in park and turned off the engine. Often, I
had to slam the shifter forward again to free the key.
   And the cruise control, on the turn signal stalk, sometimes
wound up in the ``on'' position when it wasn't activated.
   Another point: Consumer Reports' survey of owners shows
Cherokees in the 1984-6 model years ranked much worse than average
than other cars and trucks in having problems and needing repair.

<TEXT>
   Opposition to U.S. military bases is
growing as the United States and the Philippines begin talks over
the future of the last bastion of American defense in the far
Pacific.
   ``I think sooner or later the bases will have to go,'' said Sen.
Leticia Ramos-Shahani, chairwoman of the Philippines' Senate
Foreign Relations Committee. ``The only question is when and how.
We will have to cut the umbilical chord at some point.''
   The United States views the naval and air bases as crucial to
Western defense, including that of the Philippines, in the Pacific
and Indian oceans as well as the Persian Gulf. At the same time,
the installations provide the Philippines with $180 million a year
in rental income, guarantee U.S. military and economic aid and pump
millions more dollars into the local economy.
   The talks, expected to begin in early April, are part of a
periodic review of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, under which
the United States maintains facilities at Clark Air Base, Subic Bay
naval base and four smaller installations.
   About 40,000 U.S. military personnel, Defense Department
civilians and dependents are stationed at the bases, America's last
major garrisons in Southeast Asia.
   Philippine sources say President Corazon Aquino's government
will demand a substantial increase in the $180 million annual rent,
as well as an end to ``unhampered military operations'' allowed
under the current agreement.
   Some Philippine legislators have suggested the rent be increased
to more than $2 billion a year. Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus,
the chief Philippines negotiator in the talks, says $1.2 billion a
year would be ``realistic.''
   The talks will also determine whether the Philippines will allow
the bases, which are officially under Filipino command but
effectively U.S.-run, to remain after the agreement expires in
1991. Any extension must be approved by two-thirds of the
Philippines' 23-member Senate.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate Defense Committee,
said that unless the United States agrees to a substantial increase
in financial compensation, ``it would be a waste of time'' to
consider extending the agreement after 1991.
   The review will also profoundly effect the relationship between
the United States and its former colony. It takes place amid a wave
of nationalist sentiment unleashed by the 1986 uprising that
toppled President Ferdinand E. Marcos and propelled Mrs. Aquino to
power.
   That sentiment has sharpened the ``love-hate'' relationship of
58 million Filipinos with the country that crushed their
aspirations for freedom nearly a century ago and which, in the
minds of many people here, still orchestrates events in its former
colony.
   ``The review will show how far the Aquino leadership can assert
Philippine sovereignty and protect the country's interest,'' said
The Manila Chronicle.
   Apart from compensation, the issue of nuclear weapons is also
expected to complicate the talks. A provision in the new
constitution states that the Philippines ``consistent with the
national interest, adopts and pursues a policy of freedom from
nuclear weapons in its territory.''
   Three bills have been submitted in the Senate to ban not only
nuclear weapons but nuclear-powered warships. The United States
refuses to confirm or deny that it stores such weapons here. But
U.S. sources say 40 percent of the warships calling at Subic are
nuclear-powered. New Zealand, a U.S. ally, and some island nations
in the South Pacific already have banned nuclear ships from their
waters or ports.
   American officials maintain that the bases are a linchpin in the
worldwide U.S. network of installations protecting U.S. interests
in East and South Asia.
   Subic Bay, a deep-water harbor protected by the Zambales
mountains about 50 miles west of Manila, controls access to the
South China Sea, through which 90 percent of Japan's oil imports
pass. Every day, U.S. P-3 Orion aircraft take off from nearby Cubi
Point to monitor Soviet submarine traffic in the South China Sea
and the Indian Ocean, as well as Soviet military activity in
Vietnam.
   Each month, an average of 10 U.S. Navy ships call at Subic Bay,
many of them on their way to guard commercial shipping in the
Persian Gulf. Three floating drydocks provide repair service for
ships of the U.S. Navy's Pacific fleet.
   Clark Air Base, about 50 miles north of Manila, is the largest
single runway installation in the U.S. Air Force and services up to
3,500 flights a month.
   Flights move troops and supplies across a broad network of bases
from Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean to Guam, Saipan, Hawaii and
the continental United States.
   ``The American military presence also contributes directly to
the defense of the Philippines by providing a formidable deterrent
against any external threat to Philippine security,'' says the U.S.
Information Service in its pamphlet, Background on the Bases.
   But a growing number of Filipino officials question whether
their country faces a serious external threat as was perceived in
the height of the Cold War when the bases agreement was signed.

   In the eyes of Filipino opponents, the bases provide the United
States with considerable political and economic leverage over them.
   According to a widely held view, the United States supported
Marcos to protect the bases and then turned against him only when
it appeared the country was headed for a bloody upheavel that would
have threatened U.S. interests.
   ``If we get the Americans out, they won't have as much
opportunity to interfere,'' said Sen. Wigberto Tanada, a leading
bases opponent. He proposes closing the bases when the current
agreement runs out in three years and conducting studies in the
interim to find alternate uses for them.
   Supporters of the bases maintain that the Philippines, already
languishing under a $29 billion foreign debt, can ill-afford to do
without the money it receives from the bases.
   In addition to military and economic aid, the bases pay their
68,000 Filipino employees and concessionaires more than $96 million
a year. That makes the installations the country's second largest
paymaster after the Philippines government itself.
   ``We believe that if they (Americans) would pull out, it would
cause economic chaos in our city,'' said Antonio Abad Santos, mayor
of Angeles City, the home of Clark Air Base. ``It would become a
ghost town. About 55 to 60 percent of our income comes from the
base.''
   Despite the economic advantages, U.S. authorities acknowledge
that public support for the bases has declined, although a majority
still support the bases.
   A survey of about 2,000 Manila residents, taken in December by
the respected Ateneo Social Weather Station, indicated that 36
percent of the respondents believed the bases should be reduced or
closed altogether.
   That represented an increase of 11 percent in anti-bases
sentiment over the previous six months, the survey said.
   This past October, Communist rebels killed three Americans in a
series of unprecedented attacks outside Clark. The rebels have
recently stepped up operations on the Bataan peninsula, which
borders the Subic compound.
   ``I think anti-American sentiment has been part of the
U.S.-Philippine relationship from the very beginning,'' said U.S.
Ambassador Nicholas Platt. ``It's there, and I don't regard the
current situation as anything particularly threatening. It's a
function of the relationship.''
   Hostility toward the United States emerged in the
Spanish-American War in 1898, when Adm. George Dewey sailed into
Manila Bay, defeated the Spanish navy and accepted the surrender of
Spain's only Asian colony.
   The Americans forged an alliance with Filipino rebels led by
Emilio Aguinaldo, who had declared independence from Spain two
months earlier. But in the United States, pressure mounted on
President William McKinley to annex the Philippines as a colony and
deny Filipino independence.
   On Feb. 6, 1899, the U.S. Senate by a single vote ratified the
Treaty of Paris, which formally ended the Spanish-American War and
ceded the Philippines to the United States.
   That triggered the Philippine Insurrection, a vicious,
three-year conflict in which, by Philippine records, 250,000 U.S.
troops slaughtered 1 million Filipinos in a bloody guerrilla
conflict.
   Although a benign U.S. colonial administration overcame much of
the bitterness, a residual feeling of distrust and hostility toward
the United States remained.
   Such feelings have also been coupled with a sense of identity
and dependence on the United States, due largely to the fact that
unlike the Spanish, the U.S. colonial administration introduced
mass education.
   That stamped American values, as well as the English language,
on a Southeast Asian people whose culture was already a hybrid of
Malay, Chinese, Moslem and Spanish influences.
   Strong foreign influence has profoundly affected a people who,
unlike the Chinese, Japanese and other Asians, had never enjoyed
freedom as an integral nation state until the United States granted
independence July 4, 1946.
   This unique colonial legacy colors the Philippine bases debate
in a manner far different from U.S. discussions in Spain, Turkey,
West Germany, Greece and other nations that host American forces.
   ``We have problems here of identity, of the continuation of the
mentality of dependance which the Germans, the Italians and the
Greeks don't have in relation to the United States because they
were never a colony,'' Foreign Secretary Manglapus said.

<HEAD>Democrats Looked for Front-Runner As Bush Obits Proved Premature</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As George Bush amazed the pundits with a
political resurrection, the Democrats lost a front-runner off the
good ship Monkey Business, staged what looked like candidate-a-week
auditions for a replacement and now worry about a convention
without a clear winner.
   At its midpoint, the 1988 presidential campaign can claim more
than its share of unexpected twists and turns.
   Without a front-runner, the lesser known Democrats found it hard
to get attention and gain stature.
   The race became ``a series of isolated judgments,'' said Bill
Carrick, campaign manager for Rep. Richard Gephardt. Carrick
referred to the phenomenon of no Democratic being able to put
together a series of victories.
   And as both parties looked ahead to November, they expressed
pessimism.
   ``This looks to me like 1960 all over again,'' said Donald
Devine, a conservative Republican and adviser to Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole's presidential campaign. That was a year the Democrats
recaptured the White House at the close of Republican Dwight
Eisenhower's second term.
   Once again, said Devine, ``You have an aging president, who's
kind of loved and recognized as doing a decent job.''
   ``This is the Democrats' year,'' he lamented. ``The Republicans
are going to have to work real hard to change that and the
Democrats are going to have to help them a little in this
nomination process, which I think they're going to do.''
   Some Democrats agree that they could easily give the Republican
the help they need.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York predicted there'll be some
brokering before the party's nominee can be selected, and he warned
that if it takes place at the Democratic National Convention next
summer in Atlanta ``the whole United States will see you in the
grubby business of cutting deals.''
   Two Democrats _ Gary Hart and Joseph Biden _ were knocked out of
contention long before any votes were cast. Television evangelist
Pat Robertson startled Republicans with his organizational skill,
and even more with his accounts of conversations with God.
   Southern Democrats tried to give their nominating process a
conservative cast and created Super Tuesday which gave the biggest
boost to a pair of liberals _ Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis.
   Iowa's reputation took a beating and so did momentum.
   Voters demonstrated repeatedly they don't always do what the
pollsters predict they will.
   And once again, money proved the indispensable element of
campaigns for everybody but Jackson.
   After Ronald Reagan, who?
   Among Republicans, the debate centered on who could legitimately
claim his conservative legacy and retain some of his electoral
magic. For the most conservative element in the party, it also was
the year to determine whether they or GOP moderates, represented by
Bush, would control the party in the post-Reagan era.
   The Democrats looked forward to a presidential campaign without
Reagan on the ballot, but also were aware they had lost four of the
last five national elections, being virtually shut out in the South
and West.
   They, too, talked of a fight for control of the party's future.
   Both parties started out with bumper crops of candidates and
near candidates.
   Remember Donald Rumsfeld? A former Illinois congressman, White
House chief of staff and defense secretary, he had a resume that
rivaled Bush's and a speaking style that was a sure cure for
insomnia. He appeared at Republican events around the country
trying to drum up support for a presidential bid before finally
giving up on April 2, 1987.
   Former Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada, best known as Reagan's close
friend, also dipped a toe into the presidential waters but pulled
it out when he discovered how tough it could be to raise millions
of dollars.
   Conseratives were titillated by the prospect that Pat Buchanan,
the former White House communications director, or Jeane
Kirkpatrick, the former United Nations ambassador would run. Both
eventually said no.
   The Democrats had their share of reluctant dragons.
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia considered running and then didn't;
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey said, no, no, a thousand times no.
Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and his governor, Bill Clinton,
decided against running. Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado wanted to
run but found raising enough money too great a hurdle.
   And then, of course, there was the ubiquitous Governor Cuomo of
New York.
   ``I will not be a candidate,'' Cuomo declared in 1987, setting
off still more speculation on whether or not he was running.
   ``Why don't you want to be president?'' he was asked a year
later.
   ``Who said I don't want to be president?'' he retorted.
   ``Do you want to be president?'' pressed the questioner.
   ``No,'' he replied.
   But there plenty of real candidates.
   Bush, Dole, Robertson, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, former Gov.
Pete du Pont of Delaware and former secretary of state Alexander M.
Haig Jr. on the Republican side.
   Hart, Biden, Dukakis, Jackson, Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of
Arizona and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee for the Democrats.
   The race began early with Democrats Gephardt, Biden and Babbitt
taking the traditional route throught the small towns of Iowa,
campaigning for legislative candidates in the 1986 elections. Dole,
Kemp and du Pont did much the same thing on the Republican side.
   Meanwhile, Michigan Republicans tried to grab some of the
presidential campaign spotlight. In the summer of 1986, they
elected thousands of precinct level party officials who eventually
would decide the allocation of the state's 77-member delegation to
the GOP convention in New Orleans in August 1988.
   The Bush campaign liked the idea. The vice president beat Reagan
in Michigan's 1980 primary.
   But Robertson was already at work and his forces matched the
vice president's at the crucial task of recruiting candidates for
the Michigan election. That was the first indication of Robertson's
potential.
   It was bad news for Bush and even worse for Kemp.
   Then came Iran-Contra and the disclosures that the
administration had been involved in covert arms sales to the
Ayatollah.
   It was a bleak moment for the administration and it looked like
Bush would be the principal political victim.
   Dole's advisers were split on the likely impact, but the senator
was among those who thought it would severely wound Bush.
   ``I thought it was serious,'' said Lee Atwater, Bush campaign
manager. ``But I never thought it would deprive the vice president
of the nomination.''
   Iowa's economy would prove an even greater hurdle for Bush.
   Throughout the Reagan presidency, things had gone from bad to
worse in the state and it was one of the few soft spots in Reagan's
generally strong approval from Americans.
   Dole campaigned there as a fellow Midwesterner with a rural
background and an understanding of the problems of farmers.
   ``I'm from Russell, Kansas, and proud of it,'' he told countless
audiences.
   The campaign began to get nasty.
   ``He's sort of had a charmed life in politics, he's gotten quite
a ways without ever doing much,'' Dole said of the vice president.
   As Dole continued to portray Bush as a vice president who had no
more than a passive role in administration affairs, the Bush
campaign accused the senator of being ``mean-spirited'' and
practicing ``cronyism.''
   Dole later accused the Bush campaign of deliberately trying to
provoke him.
   ``I think that was the effort,'' he said. ``I was a bit testy a
time or two. I was getting angry.''

   At the start of the Democratic campaign, Hart was the
overwhelming favorite in Iowa, attracting more support in polls
than all his opponents combined.
   But a week after he announced his candidacy, the Miami Herald
published a story saying a team of its reporters had observed Hart
spending part of a weekend at his Washington townhouse with Miami
model Donna Rice. Then it was learned that Hart and the women had
traveled to Bimini together on the yacht, Monkey Business.
   The publicity was devastating and a week after he entered the
race, Hart withdrew with a bitter denunciation of the news media.
   Hart's abrupt departure scrambled the Democratic field. But one
of those given the best chance of capitalizing on the new dynamic
was Biden, the youthful chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee
and one of the party's best stump speakers.
   But four months later, Biden was forced out after disclosure
that he had lifted campaign speech material from British politician
Neil Kinnock, delivering a personal anecdote as if it were his own.
   Dukakis caught some fallout from the Biden incident when it was
learned that two of his top advisers were involved in leaking
material that pointed out the link between the Biden and Kinnock
speeches.
   As Gephardt began looking like the Iowa front-runner, his rivals
zeroed in on the congressman's populist message.
   ``Where I come from, Dick Gephardt is the establishment,'' said
Babbitt.
   ``I'm leery of election-year conversions,'' said Simon.
   Gephardt ran television ads that attacked Dukakis as ``one of
the biggest tax raisers in Massachusetts history.''
   Simon ran ads attacking Gephardt for changing his positions on
issues.
   But Gephardt appeared to have the strongest message _ a tough
attack on America's trading partners, those nations running huge
trade surpluses that could be traced to unfair practices.
   ``Because of trade barriers, a $10,000 Chrysler K-Car costs
$48,000 in Korea,'' said a Gephardt ad, ignoring the fact that the
Chrysler cars were not sold in Korea.
   Gephardt said that if the Korean didn't change their ways they'd
be left ``asking themselves how many Americans are going to pay
$48,000 for one of their Hyundais.''
   Iowa weighed in and the winners were Dole and Gephardt. Bush
finished a poor third behind Robertson.
   Next stop was New Hampshire.
   It was Dukakis' backyard and he won easily, with Gephardt edging
Simon for second place.
   On the Republican side, Dole entered New Hampshire on a roll. He
steadily eroded Bush's big lead in the state and it looked like the
Kansan would make it two in a row and probably knock Bush out of
the race.
   No one was sure what happened next.
   On the last weekend before the primary, Bush ran ads accusing
Dole of straddling on such issues as taxes and arms control. The
Dole campaign never responded.
   Bush won the primary by nine points. Dole, interviewed on
television, was asked if he had anything to say to Bush.
   ``Tell him to stop lying about my record,'' snapped the senator.
   Robertson finished last in New Hampshire, but looked ahead with
relish to the next big round, Super Tuesday in the South, the
region where he had his greatest following.
   Two other candidates made an impression in the early contests.
   Jackson showed a far greater ability to attract white votes than
he had during his first run for the presidency four years earlier.
   And Gore was conspicuous by his absence. He gambled everything
on his native South, planning to become the first beneficiary of
Super Tuesday.
   Dole bounced back to win South Dakota and Minnesota. But the
South lay ahead and the Kansan had nothing going for him in the
region.
   South Carolina Republicans held a primary the Saturday before
Super Tuesday. Robertson thought the state was tailor-made for his
Bible Belt appeal. Dole got the endorsement of Sen. Strom Thurmond,
and decided it would be a good state to challenge Bush.
   Both proved very wrong. Atwater, a South Carolina native, had
organized well for Bush and the vice president swept the state, in
a preview of Super Tuesday when he won 16 of 16 primaries. Dole was
second in most, Robertson third.
   Super Tuesday effectively ended the Republican race. A week
later, Bush swamped Dole in Illinois and the only question was when
the senator would bow out.
   On the Democratic side, it settled nothing.
   Dukakis, Jackson and Gore split the spoils, Gephardt was the big
loser.
   Simon didn't compete, but then won strongly in his home state of
Illinois which permitted him to go on for at least one more state _
Wisconsin on April 5.

   The government has delivered two welcome
pieces of economic news: consumer prices rose just 0.2 percent in
February and the economy in late 1987 expanded at the liveliest
pace in nearly two years.
   Falling energy and food prices in February helped restrain the
rise in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index after a 0.3
percent increase in January, the government said Wednesday.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the economy

   Financial markets showed scant reaction to government reports of
low inflation in February and strong economic growth at the end of
1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.49 points
Wednesday to 2,067.64 as gainers outnumbered losers about 3-to-2 on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   The dollar finished lower and interest rates on the key 30-year
Treasury bond rose to 8.73 percent from 8.70 percent.
   Falling energy and food prices in February helped restrain the
rise in the Consumer Price Index to 0.2 percent after a 0.3 percent
increase in January, the Labor Department said Wednesday.
   For the first two months of the year, prices increased at an
annual rate of 3.2 percent _ lower than the moderate 4.4 percent
inflation for all 1987.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S.
economy grew at a brisk 4.8 percent annual pace in the final three
months of last year. It was the second upward revision in the
fourth-quarter GNP, estimated a month ago at 4.5 percent and in
January at 4.2 percent.
   The department said better-than-expected performance in exports,
consumer spending and business investment led to the latest
revision, which pushed growth for the year to a rate of 4 percent
from 2.2 percent in 1986. It was the biggest annual increase since
a 5.1 percent rise in 1984.
   The 4.8 percent fourth-quarter growth followed 4.3 percent
growth in the July-September quarter and was the fastest quarterly
growth rate since an increase of 5.4 percent in the first three
months of 1986.
   Recent economic reports have shown an economy that rebounded
quickly from last October's stock market collapse. Analysts see
little likelihood of an election-year recession.
   ``One of the best kept secrets in economic circles these days is
that the Reagan administration is going to end with a bang, not a
whimper, as the economy makes a successful transition to an
export-led economy,'' President Reagan said in a speech to the
American Business Conference.
   ``There is at this point no indication of any major widespread
acceleration of inflation,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of
the Wefa Group, a Philadelphia-area economic forecasting service.
   Still, there remained pockets of inflation, particularly in
service industries. Medical care services were up 0.7 percent in
February.
   In two other economic reports:
   _The Commerce Department said after-tax corporate profits shot
up 8.4 percent in 1987 to $137.4 billion after declining the year
before. Analysts credited the turnaround in profits to the weaker
dollar, which has boosted U.S. sales overseas, and to subdued labor
wage demands.
   _The Labor Department said Americans' average weekly earnings,
after discounting for inflation, edged up 0.2 percent in February.
It was the second monthly advance, matching an identical 0.2
percent January increase, but it still left Americans'
inflation-adjusted earnings 0.7 percent below where they were a
year ago.

<HEAD>Moore McCormack Announces Recapitalization Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hostile takeover target Moore McCormack
Inc. has unveiled a $400 million recapitalization plan and says it
is holding talks with unidentified parties over a possible
alternative buyout.
   The company, target of a hostile $35 a share, or $441 million,
buyout offer from Houston-based Southdown Inc., said Wednesday its
proposed recapitalization would pay shareholders a special dividend
valued at more than $33 per share in cash and securities.
   But Moore McCormack acknowledged that it would abandon the
dividend payout if it received a buyout offer that ``produces
higher values'' for shareholders, said Paul R. Tregurtha, chairman
and chief executive.
   In trading Wednesday on New York Stock Exchange, Moore McCormack
rose $1.62{ to close at $38.75 a share.
   Under terms of a plan approved by the company's board of
directors, shareholders would receive a cash dividend of $26.60 per
common share and a newly created, 15-year subordinated debenture
with a face value of $6.62.
   In addition, the board instructed management ``to begin
immediately implementing a program that will maximize cash flow,
... reduce costs, and raise cash through the sale'' of the
company's oil and gas operations and certain other assets,
Tregurtha stated.
   Moore McCormack last month rejected the initial bid of
$31-a-share, or $391 million, from Southdown, a cement and energy
company.
   Southdown sweetened its offer to $35 per share, but Moore
McCormack's board last week called the offer inadequate and
recommended the company's shareholders reject it.
   Tregurtha said in a statement that ``the board believes that the
recapitalization is superior to the revised Southdown tender
offer.''
   He said the special dividend provided shareholders with
immediate value and allowed them to retain a long-term equity
investment in Moore McCormack.
   The company said it will proceed with the dividend payout even
if Southdown terminates its offer, unless it is acquired.
   Chemical Bank has agreed to provide up to $420 million in loans
to fund the dividends and related costs.
   With the recapitalization plan, Moore McCormack has projected
its income before interest and taxes will range from $46.2 million
in 1988 to $66.4 million in 1992.
   The company posted a profit of $21.6 million on revenue of
$357.8 million in 1987.
   Moore McCormack makes cement, concrete products and aggregates,
primarily in the southeastern United States, and is engaged in oil
and gas exploration and production.

<HEAD>GTE Says Top-Speed Laser Moves Video Jukeboxes, Video Phones
Closer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists at GTE Corp. say a new laser
that can switch on and off a record 22 billion times per second
marks a big step in the development of better televisions,
computers and video telephones.
   The tiny semiconductor laser developed at GTE Laboratories in
Waltham, Mass., theoretically would be capable of sending 200 to
400 video signals over an optical fiber simultaneously, the company
said Wednesday.
   GTE officials said the breakthrough increased the potential for
use of fiber optics _ now used mainly for carrying voice or data _
for carrying video signals as well.
   ``Your telephone is going to be a television, a computer
telephone and a voice (transmitter) rolled into one,'' said Leslie
Riseberg, director of electronics and photronics, the GTE labs
division that developed the device.
   GTE said it increased the laser's speed by decreasing the width
of the light-emitting region. It said the record topped its own
world record of 18 billion cycles per second set in 1986.
   The fibers, which are made of a flexible glass that transmits
light signals, gradually are replacing metal wires in
telecommunications. Stronger and longer-lasting than metals,
optical fibers also have the virtue of being able to carry far more
signals. But lasers needed to be created so the fibers could
achieve their potential.
   The higher the laser speed, the more signals can be sent over
the optical fibers. For example, instead of getting 20 stations on
cable television, a TV set could receive perhaps 400 channels at a
time.
   Riseberg said that in five to 10 years the faster laser
dramatically could expand the nightly viewing menu.
   ``Instead of there being a scheduled program on cable, we're
looking at technical improvements where you can pick out a video
and have it shown on your fiber,'' Riseberg said. ``Like a video
jukebox.''
   Optical fibers already connect the central offices of telephone
exchanges. In the future, the hair-thin strands may be be installed
house-to-house and business-to-business, facilitating video
telephones and computers that converse with each other more rapidly
than they can over current conventional telephone lines with a
modem.

   After four years of tortuous litigation, Texaco
Inc. has gotten permission to lower the curtain on its
multibillion-dollar legal battle with Pennzoil Co. and the historic
bankruptcy case stemming from it.
   But while that particular act may be ending, the broader drama
continues.
   The nation's third-largest oil company widely is seen as
vulnerable to a takeover attempt by investors who believe they can
realize big profits by winning control of the company and then
selling its assets.
   Such raiders may have allies among the legions of shareholders
that analysts say were disenchanted with Texaco management even
before it became entangled in the legal morass that prompted its
bankruptcy filing last April 12.
   Texaco management has vowed to resist any attempt to dismember
the company but many industry experts expect at least one
full-scale takeover attempt, which could leave a much different
Texaco standing once the battle is over.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard Schwartzberg on Wednesday
confirmed Texaco's plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection, the
keystone of which was an out-of-court settlement with Pennzoil.
   Having agreed to pay Pennzoil $3 billion in cash to drop its
$10.3 billion judgment against Texaco, the nation's third-largest
oil company is gearing up for a reorganization involving sales of
$3 billion worth of assets.
   The White Plains, N.Y.-based oil giant's troubles began in
November 1985, when a Houston jury made the unprecedented $10.3
billion damage award to Pennzoil after deciding Texaco improperly
had interfered with Pennzoil's acquisition of part of Getty Oil Co.
so that Texaco itself could buy Getty.
   Texaco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to avoid
posting what it said would be a ruinous $11 billion bond while
appealing that verdict. It was the largest bankruptcy filing in
U.S. history.
   By last December, after a string of losses in the Texas state
courts, Texaco chose to settle rather than risking everything on
the chance that the U.S. Supreme Court would overrule the judgment.
   The reorganization package approved by Schwartzberg was
negotiated laboriously by committees representing Texaco's
creditors, its shareholders, and Pennzoil. The plan takes effect _
and Pennzoil will be paid _ on April 7.
   But a lot of bitterness remains, as well as some sticky issues
raised during the bankruptcy negotiations.
   All factions of interested parties favored endorsement of the
reorganization plan, including 96 percent of the shares that were
voted on the measure. However, there still are objections to the
plan's provisions to grant immunity to all parties involved in the
original Texaco-Getty-Pennzoil matter.
   On Tuesday, a small group of dissident shareholders settled 16
suits against Texaco, saying they would support the reorganization
plan in the belief that company would be in far worse condition if
it were not approved.
   The dissidents _ along with Texaco's largest shareholder,
takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn _ had contended the liability
releases eliminated a chance for Texaco to recoup some of its
losses by suing the parties responsible for the court judgment.
   Icahn, who owns 14.8 percent of Texaco's stock, also protested
that the releases entrenched management and diminished its
accountability to shareholders.
   While voting for plan, Icahn urged the court to strike the
releases. Schwartzberg refused, agreeing with arguments by Pennzoil
and Texaco that the releases were, on balance, ``in the best
interest of Texaco.''
   Icahn consistently has been harshly critical of Texaco's
management, pointing out the company's record in replacing its
reserves was among the worst of the major oil companies.
   Several analysts, who would not speak on the record because
their companies do business with Texaco, recently expressed
sympathy with Icahn's criticism of Texaco's management.
   Noting that it was Texaco's desperation for new oil that led it
into the Getty deal in 1984, one industry watcher said he expects
Texaco to resume ``business as usual'' despite statements by
President James W. Kinnear and other top managers that the company
would boost earnings and cash flow.
   Icahn is not the only well-known takeover specialist to involve
himself with Texaco. T. Boone Pickens last month told the company
that his Mesa Limited Partnership, an oil and gas concern, was
seeking regulatory clearance to buy more than $15 million of
Texaco's stock.
   Absent objections by the Federal Trade Commission or Justice
Department, Pickens would be free to acquire up to 15 percent of
Texaco's stock.
   Getty Petroleum Co., an independent marketer of petroleum
products born of Texaco's Getty Oil Co. acquisition, has made a
similar filing.
   Icahn also has announced he will field a slate of five
candidates, including himself, when five of Texaco's 14 board seats
_ including Kinnear's _ come up for election at Texaco's next
annual meeting. The meeting tentatively is set for May, if the
company does not put itself up for sale.
   Several analysts said Kinnear may have a hard time keeping his
seat, given widespread shareholder resentment over Texaco's
business troubles in recent years.
   There also may be a lingering groundswell of resentment among
the thousands of shareholders who rely on investment dividend
income and have been deprived of Texaco dividends since the company
filed for Chapter 11, the analysts said.

<HEAD>Honolulu Mayor Leads Assault Against Japanese Investment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recent wave of Japanese purchases of
everything from farmland to memberships at prestigious country
clubs has sparked a backlash from residents peeved at a resulting
rise in property taxes and longer lines at the golf course.
   The Japanese have been investing in the Hawaiian islands since
statehood, but have drawn criticism because of recent high-profile
acquisitions made at premium prices.
   Many economists and local officials oppose the latest round of
``Japan bashing,'' calling the foreign-based investment a boon to
the state and a sign of Japanese confidence in the U.S. economy.
   But others, including Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi, want to limit
Japanese investment here.
   ``They just about own downtown,'' Fasi said Wednesday.
   Fasi has proposed state legislation to prohibit the sale of
residential, agricultural or preservation property to anyone who is
not a U.S. citizen, has no plans to become a citizen or would not
live on the land at least half the year.
   The proposal, based on similar statutes in Nebraska, Wisconsin
and Mississippi, would not affect the sale of commercial, resort
and industrial land. It has little chance of being considered by
the state legislature because it was submitted late in the session.
   Fasi blames the Japanese for skyrocketing property taxes
resulting from rising home prices as well as longer waits for
tee-off times at the Honolulu Country Club, where Japanese
nationals pay $150,000 for memberships. But he denies his proposal
is racist.
   ``All I'm trying to do is stop the speculators from doing here
what they've already done in Japan,'' which is price out the
average buyer, Fasi said.
   Earlier this week it was announced that a Japanese real estate
firm paid a record $280 a square foot _ about $14 million total _
for a parcel of land in Honolulu's Kapiolani business district.
   Japanese investors have paid a total of $99 million for property
along Kapiolani Boulevard since 1986.
   Another Japanese investor sparked protests last month over his
plans to evict an elderly couple from the agricultural land they
had leased for 10 years so he could build a golf course.
   A Japanese real estate firm recently paid $21 million for ``Casa
Blanca Del Mar,'' the highest price ever paid for a private home in
the exclusive southern Oahu beachfront area of Waialae-Kahala. The
average value of homes in the neighborhood has risen between 30
percent and 100 percent under the latest city property assessments,
mostly because foreign investors have been snapping up houses at
high prices.
   Area residents say they have received unsolicited offers in
their mailboxes and been offered millions of dollars in cash for
their homes.
   Wali Osman, associate economist of the Bank of Hawaii, said the
strength of the Japanese yen and the ability to borrow against
high-priced Tokyo properties allows the Japanese to pay more than
U.S. buyers.
   ``What the Japanese are doing is perfectly logical,'' Osman
said. ``They would be foolish not to take advantage of the strength
of their yen.''
   The Japanese have invested heavily in Hawaii since the 1960s.
Osman said the latest surge _ about $3 billion invested since 1986
_ attracted attention only because so many properties were
purchased in a short time.
   ``Maybe they put in a little too much money a little too fast,''
Osman said. ``But $3 billion is a small portion of the total assets
in the state.''
   Osman said Fasi's proposal ignores the rights of the seller and
discriminates against the Japanese.
   ``People have been selling their houses to the Japanese for
twice as much as they could get elsewhere,'' Osman said. ``They've
been getting rich. What about their right to sell to whoever offers
the highest price?''
   Hawaii Lt. Gov. Ben Cayetano dismisses Fasi's plan as political
rhetoric.
   ``The man's running for re-election,'' Cayetano said. ``But he's
a hypocrite. On the one hand he's telling the Japanese to pour in
their money for business development and then he's saying they
can't invest in houses here.''
   Fasi has proposed that Japanese firms be allowed to build a
convention center here and that they help finance a light rail
rapid transit system.
   Cayetano said Fasi was fueling an anti-Japanese attitude that
could cause a backlash against Japanese-Americans _ who make up
about 25 percent of Hawaii's population _ and Japanese visitors,
who have invigorated the state's tourist industry.
   According to the Hawaii Vistors Bureau, about 20 percent of the
5.7 million people who vacationed in the islands last year were
from Japan. They accounted for 33 percent of vistor expenditures,
more than triple the share of their counterparts from the mainland
and Canada.
   ``He (Fasi) is doing what is politically popular at the
moment,'' Cayetano said. ``But here, where the Japanese are so
important, it's especially insulting.''
   Osman said that if Fasi's proposal was rejected, the current
wave of anti-Japanese sentiment should blow over, as it had in the
past.
   ``This isn't the first time politicians have used this tactic,''
Osman said. ``But we aren't about to become a colony of Japan, and
people who think so are just overreacting.''

<HEAD>Industry Assesses Impact of Hyundai Victory in Canadian Dumping
Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dollar figures are U.S. unless otherwise noted.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. warned of
future job losses and free-trade problems after a Canadian tribunal
dismissed their claims of damages from the sale of inexpensive
Hyundai Motor Co. cars from South Korea.
   The Canadian Import Tribunal ruled Wednesday that it found no
evidence of material injury to Ford or GM subsidiaries because of
the cut-price compact cars that Hyundai has sold in Canada since
1984.
   The three-member government panel ordered a halt to anti-dumping
proceedings against Hyundai and a refund of some $8 million in
bonds the company had posted.
   Wednesday's ruling has implications for all North American car
makers: the Canadian auto industry is linked with U.S. operations
under a 1965 trade agreement treating the continent as a single
market.
   Hyundai was forced to post the bonds when Revenue Canada, the
government tax collector, upheld the dumping complaint last
November and imposed preliminary import duties averaging 26 percent.
   Dumping is the practice of exporting goods at a price below what
they cost in the domestic market.
   Ford and GM accused Hyundai of introducing its Pony, Stellar and
Excel models in Canada at below-cost prices to get a foothold in
North America. They complained they lost profits when they had to
slash prices and offer rebates to remain competitive.
   At hearings that ended March 10, Hyundai acknowledged its aim
was to gain a path to the lucrative U.S. market. But the company
denied harming Ford, GM or the Canadian auto industry.
   Hyundai said the U.S. car giants did not make subcompacts in
Canada and contended Ford was making handsome profits here.
Furthermore, both companies have business links to other South
Korean carmakers, Hyundai noted.
   The Canadian government's Bureau of Competition Policy
intervened on behalf of Hyundai to say the company had fostered
competition in the small-car market and kept prices down.
   Within a year of introducing its $4,500 Pony hatchback, Hyundai
cornered 7 percent of the Canadian car market. It then expanded to
the United States where it sold 264,000 Excels last year.
   But recent Canadian sales were depressed because of the dumping
case. If upheld, the duties would have added $800 to the price of a
new Hyundai.
   The Canadian Importers Association called the decision a
``triumph'' for consumers, while Hyundai issued a statement from
Seoul welcoming the decision.
   Whatever the outcome of the case, the South Korean conglomerate
had pledged to proceed with plans for a $259 million manufacturing
plant in Bromont, Quebec, and a parts factory in Newmarket, Ontario.
   Ford and GM have 10 days to appeal to the Federal Court of
Canada. They said they would decide after receiving the tribunal's
detailed explanations next month.
   Both companies warned that unfair foreign competition could lead
to job losses in the Canadian industry, which employs 140,000
workers directly and another 400,000 indirectly, mostly in southern
Ontario and Quebec Province.
   ``It has been and remains our contention that continued
unrestrained dumping by Hyundai will result in lost jobs and
investment in the Canadian auto industry,'' stated George Peapples,
president of GM Canada.
   Ford spokesman Jim Hartford complained of flaws in Canadian
trade law and said the case set a bad precedent for the Canada-U.S.
free trade agreement due for ratification by the Canadian
Parliament and by Congress later this year.
   Hartford said the law forced the tribunal to look at Ford
production and sales only in Canada, where small-car output has
been phased out, instead of examining Ford's integrated operations
throughout the continent.
   ``We're alarmed by the implications today's decision has for
other industries which may become rationalized under the free-trade
agreement,'' Hartford said.
   He said the shortcoming must be fixed in the first years of the
free-trade treaty or more industries will come in for ``predatory
dumping.''

   Declining mid-March sales of U.S.-made cars are
not a sign of trouble but a return to balance in the market,
industry analysts say.
   Combined domestic car and light truck sales totaled 298,754
during the March 11-20 sales period, down from 333,623 for
mid-March 1987 but up 0.7 percent on a daily basis, the automakers
reported Wednesday.
   ``I don't see this weakness in mid-March as a prediction of
greater weakness throughout the year,'' said auto analyst Chris
Cedergren.
   The eight companies making autos in the United States sold
189,245 cars in the period's eight sales days, down from 217,939 in
nine sales days in the comparable 1987 period. The daily sales rate
slid 2.3 percent.
   Sales of domestic-made light trucks totaled 109,509, a decrease
from 115,684 in the year-ago period but still a 6.5 percent
increase in daily sales.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
   Domestic sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.4
million for the mid-March period. That would indicate a decline
from 1987's 7.1 million in domestic sales, although in the 30 days
before the March period sales ran at an 8.1 million annual pace.
   ``It looks like sales are beginning to drop back down to a more
expected level,'' said Cedergren, of J.D. Power & Associates in
Westlake Village, Calif.
   Jeannette Garretty, an analyst at Bank of America in San
Francisco, said sales surged earlier as some people responded to
buying incentives offered by the automakers and as some went ahead
with purchases put off after the October stock market crash.
   ``Now it is going to start to settle down,'' she said.
   Sales of U.S.-made cars and trucks for the year to date totaled
2.4 million, up 16.4 percent on a daily basis from 2.1 million sold
through the mid-March period in 1987.
   Industry leader General Motors Corp. sold 92,173 domestic-made
cars in the March 11-20 period, down from 105,438 in the 1987
period. GM's daily sales rate fell by 1.7 percent.
   Ford Motor Co. auto sales of 54,186 fell from 67,672 in the
year-earlier period, and were down 9.9 percent on a daily basis.
   Chrysler car sales jumped to 30,801 in this year's eight-day
selling period from 31,699 in the nine-day period in 1987, up 9.3
percent daily. Chrysler light truck sales jumped even more, to
24,691 from 20,987 in the year-earlier period, a 32.4 percent leap
in daily sales.
   GM truck sales totaled 45,376 in the eight-day period compared
with 43,515 a year earlier, with the daily sales rate rising by
17.3 percent.
   Ford light truck sales sagged to 36,812, from 49,164 in the
year-earlier period. The daily sales rate fell 15.8 percent.
   Market shares of the Big Three automakers changed slightly from
a year earlier, with GM capturing 48.7 percent, compared with 48.4
percent; Ford dropping to 28.6 percent from 31.1 percent, and
Chrysler rising to 16.3 percent from 14.5 percent.
   Aggressive incentives paid off for some Japanese companies
making cars in the United States. Honda's sales of 7,270
represented a 9.8 percent increase in daily sales rate.
   Volkswagen of America sold 1,034 U.S.-made cars, down from 1,330
a year earlier, and down 12.5 percent on a daily basis.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for March 11-20.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were eight selling days in the period this year and nine last
year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Volkswagen, Honda,
Nissan, Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic and appear in this
table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sales under the GM, Ford and
Crysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Beazer Makes Higher Koppers Proposal; Koppers Workers Demonstrate</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto PG2 of March 23</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investment group pursuing Koppers Co. has
proposed a negotiated buyout at $60 a share, topping its current
hostile offer of $56 a share, while hundreds of Koppers employees
demonstrated against the ongoing takeover attempt.
   The new proposal has an indicated value of about $1.68 billion,
compared with $1.57 billion for the alternative hostile bid. It was
made in a letter sent late Wednesday to Koppers Chairman Charles R.
Pullin from British investor Brian C. Beazer.
   Beazer has teamed with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the New York
investment banker, in its attempt to acquire the Pittsburgh
building materials, paving services and chemical company. The
hostile tender offer remains in effect, said Beazer spokeswoman
Lissa Perlman.
   Koppers spokesman Robert J. O'Gara said the company had no
immediate comment on the latest proposal.
   Kopper's board of directors has rejected Beazer's $56 a share
offer as inadequate, and reiterated it was exploring a possible
defensive recapitalization that would include a one-time payment to
shareholders.
   ``We believe we are able to offer greater value to your
stockholders than any plan you are presently considering,'' Beazer
stated in his letter to Pullin. ``If you have a recapitalization
plan that provides your stockholders and employees with more
benefits than we are prepared to provide, we, and your other
stockholders, are anxious to see it.''
   Separately, about 250 of the company's employees cut up an
estimated 175 charge cards from American Express Co., which owns 60
percent of Shearson, during a downtown protest.
   ``We're damn mad,'' said Koppers Vice President J. Roger
Beidler. ``We want American Express to know that this gathering is
just the tip of the iceberg.''
   Management also has canceled its American Express account,
through which the company had been buying about $1.5 million per
year in goods and services, said O'Gara.
   Koppers has accused Shearson Lehman of offering to defend the
company from hostile takeovers at the same time that it was
plotting its attack with Beazer.
   ``That's quite a deal, and we're saying no,'' Beidler said.
``We're going to send our cards back to American Express in
pieces.''
   American Express and Shearson also have come under fire from
state officials for their role in the hostile bid.

<HEAD>Delay In New Software Depresses Lotus Stock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lotus Development Corp.'s stock could
remain depressed for some time following the company's announcement
of a six-month delay in the release of a new version of its
high-selling 1-2-3 software, industry watchers say.
   Wall Street analysts this week scaled back their earnings
estimates for the company after it delayed the new Release 3
software. In addition, Lotus executives sold off large blocks of
stock and a top executive resigned.
   ``I think the stock is going to underperform until we get closer
to the release date on shipment of the 1-2-3 Release 3,'' David J.
Readerman, an analyst with Smith Barney & Co., said Wednesday.
   Lotus fell $3.50 a share to $25.25 a share in over-the-counter
trading Wednesday, a 12 percent drop in market value.
   Last month, Lotus President Jim P. Manzi sold 250,000 shares of
company stock, and several vice presidents sold between 12,800
shares and 95,800 shares. Charles J. Digate, senior vice president
in charge of software development, left the company last week.
   Lotus said some of the stock sales occurred because executives
exercised stock options last August and had to wait six months
before selling to meet tax payments.
   But Readerman said: ``The timing of the sales just raises a
credibility issue. That is as much a reason why the stock is down.
If it was just the product slip date, I don't think you'd see the
stock where it is.''
   Analysts said Lotus is trailing its competitors in developing
new spreadsheet programs and said they expected some of the 3.5
million Lotus 1-2-3 users to defect to other brands.
   ``For some reason Lotus just hasn't kept pace with the industry
in bringing out new products,'' said Rick Sherlund of Goldman,
Sachs & Co. ``They've been long on promise in announcing new
products but short on delivery.''
   Analysts cut Lotus' 1988 earnings per share estimates to between
$1.55 and $1.65 from about $1.95. They also trimmed revenue
forecasts for the year to about $400 million from $465 million.
   Lotus last year reported net income of $72 million, or $1.58 per
share, on revenue of $395.6 million.
   The upgraded 1-2-3 software originally was expected in June. The
company said the new program, which promises to print better
graphs, work faster and combine many spreadsheets, will be
available in the fourth quarter.
   Analysts said the delay would give Borland International Corp.
of Scotts Valley, Calif., and Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash., a
chance to gain market share with new software products designed to
compete with 1-2-3.
   Last November, Borland released its Quattro spreadsheet, which
has been praised as better than 1-2-3, and Microsoft, the leading
personal computer software maker, released its Windows Excel
software.
   Martin Fahey, Lotus' investor relations director, said the
company needs more time to make the new 1-2-3 programs small enough
to work with personal computers.
   ``We obviously are concerned about the delay,'' Fahey said.
``Any time a product slips it's not good. (But) we think it's going
to be worth waiting for.''
   The new 1-2-3 will cost $495, same as the old one. People who
have an authorized copy of the current 1-2-3 can upgrade for $150.
Analysts project $100 million to $150 million in sales in the first
12 to 18 months of its release.
   Lotus on Wednesday named W. Frank King III, a former vice
president of development for International Business Machines
Corp.'s personal computer division, to replace Digate.

   Cable News Network will produce Spanish-language
news programming for broadcast exclusively on the television
network operated by Telemundo Group Inc., company officials have
announced.
   The programming, slated to begin by May 31, will include a
30-minute national and international newscast, an hourlong
week-in-review program, and news briefs to appear five times daily,
Monday through Friday.
   The newscasts' correspondents will be based in New York,
Washington D.C., Miami, Los Angeles and key cities in Latin
America, the network said Wednesday.
   Telemundo Group, based in New York, owns and operates stations
in four of the five largest Hispanic markets in the United States _
Los Angeles, New York, Miami and San Francisco-San Jose _ and
reaches about 60 percent of U.S. Hispanic households.

   The wine in the $3,200 bottle was an
acclaimed 1984 merlot, but there was something even rarer about the
Cuvaison magnum that Texan Steven Schwartz bought at a recent
Dallas charity auction.
   The grape art label on the Napa Valley wine was believed to be
the first work designed for wine by the pop art pioneer Andy
Warhol, who died last year in New York at age 58.
   Warhol donated the art to the Cuvaison winery in the late 1970s.
It is a striking, bias-cut piece based on a stylized vision of what
Warhol thought nature should have made grapes look like: the six
grapes are in hues of red and deep green.
   The overall label, which was placed on just 84 bottles, has
Warhol's name cut in above the art. It was designed and completed
last year by California graphic artist Channing Rudd under
commission by Cuvaison President Manfred Esser.
   Said Rudd, ``The label was at first considered to be very
strange,'' but, like the wine, the work improved with age and came
into increasing favor. Esser finally ordered the art made into a
finished label, and Rudd readied it for reproduction in a week.
   ``Warhol did many commercial things, but basically Warhol was a
fine artist,'' said Rudd. ``He was a painter who experimented with
silk-screening and avant-garde techniques. I tried to do the same
thing, only convert it into something marketable.''
   Still under wraps are Warhol's creations for two other labels,
one for white wine, the other for rose. No plans for them have been
announced.
   As a memorial to Warhol's talent, Switzerland's industrialist
Schmidheiny family, which owns Cuvaison, ordered the current
labeling limited to 84 bottles.
   Alexander and Christina Schmidheiny were friends of Warhol's,
and thought to use his work to evoke a fine-arts theme for special
wines.
   ``We intended this label to be one of a series of artist's
labels for Cuvaison's special bottlings,'' Mrs. Schmidheiny said.
``When the 1984 Cuvaison merlot was released, we decided to use his
label only on 84 magnum bottles on the occasion of the 15th
anniversary of the winery.''
   ``As it turned out, the wine itself was very well
received...hopefully a small memorial to Mr. Warhol's great
talent.''

<HEAD>Dollar Steadies at Lower Levels, Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar steadied at lower levels early in
Europe today after a sell-off during Asian trading.
   Gold prices rose.
   Traders said the dollar was driven downward in Asia by trading
benefitting the yen and British pound.
   U.S. economic indicators due later today, including personal
income for February, were not likely to move the market since an
upward revision of the U.S. gross national product for the fourth
quarter was disregarded Wednesday, dealers said.
   The growth rate was revised to an annual rate of 4.8 percent, up
from the previously reported 4.5 percent.
   ``There is still room for the yen and the pound to strengthen,''
said a trader in Frankfurt. That means the dollar could fall a
little lower during the course of the day, he said.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar closed at 126.30 yen, down 0.85 yen
   Later, in London, it was quoted at 126.00 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6858 West German marks, down from
1.6915; 1.3940 Swiss francs, down from 1.3990; 5.7305 French
francs, down from 5.7450; 1.8943 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9005;
1,248.95 Italian lire, down from 1,253.25; 1.2440 Canadian dollars,
up from 1.2434.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8425, compared
with $1.8358 Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $452.40 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $453.00. At mid-morning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$453.90.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $453.25, up from $450.40 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.34 to close at $455.40 an
ounce.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.67 a troy
ounce, up from Wednesday's $6.63.

   The dollar slid further against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo today, while stock prices also lost moderately.
   After opening at 126.75, the dollar edged down and closed at
126.30 yen, down 0.85 yen from its close of 127.15 yen on
Wednesday. It ranged between 126.15 and 126.81 yen.
   Today's fall followed a 1.28-yen plunge on Tuesday, although the
dollar edged up 0.08 yen on Wednesday.
   ``The prevalent view is that the dollar will go down further,''
said Taeko Kobayashi of the Bank of Tokyo.
   The decline in Tokyo today followed the dollar's drop in New
York the previous day, attributed to a prediction by Martin
Feldstein, a former economic adviser to President Reagan, that the
dollar could fall to 120 yen or lower over the next six months.
   There was no news to affect the dollar during Tokyo's trading
today, however, Ms. Kobayashi said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Average of 225 selected
issues, a 52.48-point gainer Wednesday, today lost 113.95 points,
or 0.44 percent, closing at 25,781.28.
   ``Profit-taking buy orders for large-capital issues, such as
steels and heavy electricals, brought the stock average down,''
said Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko Securities.
   The market, which had been driven by these major issues since
the beginning of March, seemed to have taken a rest, with the trade
volume declining to an estimated 800 million shares, he said.
   Shimoyama said investors retreated to the sidelines to watch the
market's movements.
   Major losers today were steels and shipbuilding issues. Some
electrical, real estate and shipping issues also lost ground.

   Convicted stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who
made millions trading on inside information, would earn a maximum
of 44 cents an hour at tasks ranging from landscaping to milking
cows as an inmate in the prison recommended by his sentencing judge.
   Boesky, 51, arrived Wednesday afternoon at the Lompoc, Calif.,
prison camp, to begin serving his three-year term, the prison said.
   U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker, who sentenced Boesky on Dec.
18, had given him until today to surrender.
   The Lompoc facility, a 700-inmate minimum security facility
about 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles near the Pacific coast, is
located on about 44,000 acres of heavily forested countryside and
contains a dairy, slaughterhouse and furniture factory. Inmates
sleep in a former army barracks.
   Lompoc warden Richard Rison said in a telephone interview last
week that if Boesky would have no special privileges or cushy
prison jobs.
   ``Our people are assigned based on where our needs are,'' said
Rison. ``He could be in the slaughterhouse, he could be in the
landscape crew, he could be working in the dairy operation. He will
be required to work a fulltime assignment.''
   Rison said the pay scale ranged from 11 cents to 44 cents an
hour for a 40-hour week. As in other federal prison facilities, the
money is credited to an account at the prison commissary, where
inmates can buy toiletries, cigarettes and candy.
   During off hours, Rison said, inmates can play tennis on a
single concrete court, lift weights, roll boccie ball, shoot
billiards or watch cable television at a half-dozen sets placed
around the facility. Inmates have access to eight telephones but
Rison said there's a 15-minute limit on calls.
   Lompoc has been home to some other famous convicts, including
former Nixon administration aide H.R. Haldeman and fireworks
magnate W. Patrick Moriarty, who was convicted in a major
government-bribery and influence-peddling scandal. Convicted spy
Christopher Boyce was incarcerated in Lompoc's maximum-security
section but escaped and led authorities on a chase for several
months before he was seized in the Northwest.
   Boesky, formerly one of Wall Street's best known speculators,
stunned the financial world in November 1986 when he paid the
Securities and Exchange Commission a record $100 million fine to
settle civil charges of insider trading, the misuse of confidential
information to profit in securities deals.
   Since then he has cooperated extensively with federal
investigators. In exchange, he was allowed to plead guilty to a
single criminal count of conspiracy to lie to the SEC.
   Boesky's revelations reportedly have led to death threats
against him, and there was speculation he had sought federal
custody early because he feared for his life.
   Last month, John Mulheren, a former Boesky friend and fellow
speculator, was arrested on charges he threatened to kill Boesky
and Boesky's former head trader, Michael Davidoff, who also has
pleaded guilty to securities fraud and is cooperating with
investigators.

   Stock prices were sharply lower at midday Thursday
as the market's budget-related rally finally ran out of steam.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 stocks was off
27.8 points, or 1.5 percent, at 1,804.4.
   Volume was 297.3 million shares at midday, up from 211.2 million
shares at the same time a day earlier.
   Dealers said the market was marked down heavily soon after
trading started.
   The 100-stock index had moved well above the 1,800-point level
prior to Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's March 15 budget
statement. Investors predicted the budget would include major tax
cutting measures and bullish forecasts on the British economy.
   The announcement of the budget met those expectations, but since
then, the market has been unable to push much higher.
   ``Having seen not much follow-through since the budget in terms
of buying, the question was whether there would be selling,'' said
Chris Chaitow, an analyst at Morgan Grenfell Securities. ``Today
has shown that there is selling.''
   Dealers said the market's nervousness was exacerbated by rumors
of a major selling program by County Natwest Securities. But
dealers at the brokerage firm denied there had been such a program
Thursday.

<HEAD>First City Chairman: Bondholders Should Not Hold Out For Better
Terms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The future chairman of First City Bancorporation
of Texas Inc. says the banking concern's restructuring plans, and
the economic well-being of Texas, are being jeopardized by a group
of dissident debtholders.
   ``It's not in their best interest to hang onto the bonds if
they're going to crater the deal in the process,'' A. Robert Abboud
said Wednesday before the French-American Chamber of Commerce.
   Abboud, a Chicago investor who would become of First City under
a federal bailout plan, is seeking to complete a $1.5 billion
restructuring of the Houston company.
   The restructuring deal requires 90 percent participation by the
close of business next Tuesday. But as of late Tuesday only about
51 percent of the holders of First City notes totaling $225.9
million had tendered their securities.
   Senior debt holders have been offered 45 cents on the dollar for
their debt, while subordinated debt holders have been offered 35
cents.
   ``On a liquidation basis, their investment is worth zero,''
Abboud said, referring to the $100 million in subordinated debt.
``Once the preconditions are established, we have to stick to
them.''
   Abboud is trying to restructure First City using $970 million in
assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and
another $500 in privately raised capital.
   Abboud said he was optimistic a deal could be closed. First City
shareholders already have voted to support the Abboud plan.

   The stock market declined broadly today as the
dollar slumped in foreign exchange and U.S. interest rates headed
higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 31.17 to 2,036.47
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 6 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 32.18 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   With the dollar losing ground, prices of long-term government

   Analysts said pressure on the dollar prompted concern in markets
around the world. Prices fell in both the London and Tokyo stock

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Positions Toughen on Beef, Citrus Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan seeks an agreement with the United States by
the end of March on opening the Japanese market wider to American
beef and citrus fruit, but there still are conflicting opinions in
Japan on the issue, a government official said Thursday.
   The current agreement on Japan's quotas on those items expires
March 31.
   Separately, a senior aide to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
left for Washington Thursday for talks aimed at a political
solution to a dispute over U.S. access to Japan's construction
market.
   On the agricultural issue, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said this week the United States wants all quotas dropped
by April 1, or it will take the issue to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, an international forum for settling trade
disputes.
   Yoshifumi Matsuda, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said
Thursday, ``Our interest is to have a coordinated result, an
agreement between the two governments by the end of the month.''
   Asked how far Japan was willing to go to compromise short of
total liberalization, he said there were conflicting opinions and
the government was not ready to make a statement.
   The United States refuses to negotiate unless Japan sets a clear
timetable for liberalization, something Japan has been unwilling to
do. Members of Japan's ruling Liberal-Democratic Party have
expressed strong opposition to liberalization.
   ``GATT is a good place to fight this out,'' said Tsutomu Hata,
head of the LDP's Agriculture Committee, after arguing in a meeting
Wednesday that producing beef and oranges is essential to domestic
farmers, and these must be protected.
   ``A country should be able to produce basic food items on its
own,'' said Mitsuru Yoshida of the Livestock Industry Promotion
Corp. ``The United States is a very big country and so can produce
a lot. But Japan is very small and thus needs to protect itself.''
   While farmers and many consumers fear liberalization will
destroy the domestic beef and citrus industry, leading to
unemployment and a dangerous dependence on foreign sources of food,
Yeutter commented: ``If it did mean some structural adjustment,
that's the price we pay for a free and open trading system. We've
had some adjustment, too.''
   Last month, a senior Economic Planning Agency official predicted
that imports of beef would be liberalized within two years, with a
lifting of restrictions on citrus fruit even sooner.
   Tentative moves to appease foreign critics include proposals
announced Thursday by an advisory council to the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries for a revision of the upper and
lower ceilings on domestic beef and pork price supports, said a
ministry official who requested anonymity.
   Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, who is traveling to
the United States to discuss agricultural issues, is scheduled to
meet with U.S. Commerce Secretary William Verity and other U.S.
officials.
   An aide to Ozawa declined to specify what new offers, if any,
Ozawa would make to U.S. officials in an attempt to settle the
dispute.
   Following the failure of working-level negotiations earlier this
month, U.S. officials gave Japan two weeks to come up with a
satisfactory proposal to end the dispute. Otherwise, they said the
United States may invoke a law calling for compensation from Japan.

   The Environmental Protection Agency has
ordered General Motors Corp. to recall almost half a million 1985
cars and light trucks sold under the Chevrolet, Pontiac and GMC
nameplates, EPA said today.
   The cars exceed federal standards for carbon monoxide exhaust
emissions and for evaporated gasoline, EPA said.
   Such orders are rare and are generally a sign the agency and the
manufacturer could not agree on something, such as the cause of the
problem, its scope, the necessary repair or terms of the recall.
Most recalls are made voluntarily.
   GM's Washington office said the company would have a statement
later.
   The company has 45 days either to request a public hearing to
contest the order, or to submit a repair plan for EPA's approval
before notices are mailed to owners.
   EPA said the affected vehicles are equipped with 5.0-liter (305
cubic inches) and 5.7-liter (350 cubic inches) engines and were
sold as the Chevrolet Impala, Caprice Classic, Camaro, Monte Carlo
and El Camino; the Pontiac Firebird, Bonneville, Grand Prix and
Parisienne; and the GMC Caballero. Models sold in California, which
are built to stricter standards, are included.
   The excessive emissions are in part the result of defects in a
thermal vacuum switch in the evaporation control system, EPA said.
But the agency said simple replacement of the switch may not
completely remedy the problem and further repairs, which it did not
specify, may be necessary.
   Last year, GM recalled more than a million vehicles from the
1982 and 1983 model years for similar problems.
   GM also is recalling about 4,900 1988 Chevrolet Corvettes to fix
defective wheel welds that could cause the wheel center to separate
from the rim during braking or cornering.
   The automaker said Wednesday it is also recalling about 460 1987
GMC and Chevrolet full-size vans to correct fuel tank filler pipes
that could cause fuel to leak during refueling or turning.
   No accidents or injuries have been linked to either problem, GM
said. Vehicle owners are being notified of the recall by dealers,
who will correct the problems at no charge, the company said.
   The Corvettes, all equipped with 17-inch wheels, may be missing
a weld on some wheels, GM said. The condition could result in
partial loss of steering control and a sudden changed in vehicle
direction, the automaker said.

   Major U.S. airlines have no immediate plans to
match Northwest Airlines' bold new move to ban smoking on most of
its flights, and some industry analysts say the carriers are
unlikely to do so.
   Northwest, the nation's fifth-largest airline, announced
Wednesday it will prohibit smoking on all its domestic flights
except those to and from Hawaii and on some foreign routes.
   The ban makes Minneapolis-based Northwest the first major U.S.
airline to mandate a smoke-free environment in the air. It goes
beyond federal regulations that will outlaw smoking on all domestic
flights of two hours or less beginning April 23.
   Northwest said its prohibition was a response to passenger and
employee requests. A.B. ``Sky'' Magary, Northwest's executive vice
president for marketing, told a news conference in New York that
while the policy is not without risk, ``we believe more nonsmokers
will switch to Northwest than smokers will leave.''
   Wall Street seemed unimpressed by Northwest's smoke-free
innovation. The airline's stock closed on the New York Stock
Exchange at $45.75 a share, down 12{ cents from Tuesday.
   Some analysts believe Northwest risks chasing away potential
passengers, and other big airlines appear reluctant to follow the
carrier's lead.
   ``We have no plans to follow that move,'' said Mary O'Neill, a
spokeswoman for No. 2 American Airlines. Recent surveys conducted
by American indicated a significant segment of people who want to
smoke on planes, despite a growing demand for smoke-free areas, she
said.
   American and several other big airlines contacted Wednesday
stressed that they planned to establish no-smoking policies in line
with the new federal law.
   Under those rules, passengers who insist on lighting up will
face civil fines of as much as $1,000, and fliers who tamper with
smoke alarms in airplane lavatories face up to $2,000 in penalties.
   ``We are ready to implement our no-smoking policy ... in line
with the federal law,'' said United Airlines spokesman Dan Sheehy.
United, the nation's largest airline, has had a smoking ban in
place since Jan. 1 on all its flights within California, in
accordance with a state law.
   Fourth-ranked Delta Air Lines has garnered a lot of support for
its own California smoking ban, spokesman Jim Lundy said.
   He said Delta's reaction to Northwest's move was ``really tough
to call,'' but did not rule out further action by his airline.
   ``We will of course take a look at what Northwest is doing and
see if we want to make an adjustment to our program,'' Lundy said.
   Anthony Hatch, an airline analyst for Argus Research Corp., said
he did not expect the other carriers to match Northwest's policy.
   ``It's a gutsy move and most airlines don't make gutsy moves,''
Hatch said. ``It could alienate some people.''
   Three smokers, who were waiting to depart on Northwest flights
Wednesday from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, said
they don't object to the carrier's new smoking ban.
   ``It's probably a good idea,'' Janice Davis, a Boston real
estate broker, told the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch. ``I can
get by without smoking.''
   Even some Northwest flight attendants, who are smokers, told the
newspaper the new policy might help them quit smoking.
   The new policy, called ``Northwest Clears the Air,'' will take
effect April 23, the same day as the new federal regulations. It
will apply to flights within the contiguous 48 states and flights
to and from Alaska, Mexico, Canada, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.
   The longest flights covered by the smoking ban are four or five
hours, according to the airline. About 30 percent of Northwest's
domestic flights and about 20 percent of all domestic flights last
more than the two-hour duration covered by the new federal smoking
regulations.
   Northwest flights to and from Hawaii and overseas will continue
offering smoking sections because those flights ``carry a greater
proportion of foreign passengers who feel differently about the
issue,'' the airline stated.
   ``We still have (foreign) competitors that are handing out
cigars to passengers on board,'' Magary said.
   But even that could be changing. Air U.K. Ltd., a small British
airline that flies to destinations in Britain and Western Europe,
is banning smoking on all its flights effective next Sunday.
   And a spokesman in London for British Airways PLC, one of the
world's largest airlines, said the carrier was looking ``quite
seriously'' at the possibility of banning smoking on both short and
long flights.
   The trend also has appeared in Southwest Asia.
Government-controlled Singapore Airlines unveiled plans Wednesday
to introduce the first no-smoking commercial flights in the region
next month.
   Smoking will be barred on four of the 14 daily shuttle flights
between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, the capital of neighboring
Malaysia, starting April 4. The trip takes about 45 minutes.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British labor union delegation left Thursday for
Detroit in hopes of persuading Ford Motor Co. to change its mind
and locate an electronic components plant in Scotland.
   ``We have a monumental task ahead of us,'' Gavin Laird, head of
the Amalgamated Engineering Union, said before the five-member
delegation left London's Heathrow Airport.
   The delegation left a day after the Trades Union Congress,
Britain's national labor federation, agreed to Ford demands for a
single-union deal at the proposed plant in Dundee, Scotland.
   The group included TUC general secretary Norman Willis.
   After five months of squabbling among British unions about the
deal, Ford announced this week it would not locate the $73 million
plant in Britain.
   Prodded by this, the Trades Union Congress' General Council on
Wednesday voted 23-15 for the single-union deal. The Transport and
General Workers' Union, Britain's largest union, remained opposed.
   The TGWU represents two-thirds of Ford's more than 32,000
British workers and was insisting on being allowed into the Dundee
plant.
   The plant was expected to employ 450 workers.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened narrowly
mixed today in quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures were slightly lower. The market is caught in a
tug-of-war between traders expecting seasonal price weakness to
develop and those looking for new export business to push prices
higher, said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   The corn and soybean markets were quiet and likely will stay
that way through next Thursday, when the Agriculture Department
releases its first estimates of this year's planted acreage, Spilka
said.
   Recent volatility in the precious metals and currency futures
markets has had surprisingly little impact on grain futures prices,
probably because grain traders are beginning to look more at
supply-and-demand fundamentals and paying less attention to the
prices of other commodities, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.06{ a bushel; corn was unchanged
to } cent higher with May at $2.06{ a bushel; oats were \ cent
higher across the board with May at $1.68 a bushel; soybeans were }
cent to 1} cents higher with May at $6.40{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .20 cent higher with April at
74.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .30 cent lower
with March at 82.37 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower to .50
cent higher with April at 45.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .05 cent lower to .30 cent higher with March at 55.40 cents a

   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Wednesday.

   Guinness PLC, the British brewing company, said
Thursday its earnings more than quadrupled in 1987 due to
extraordinary items.
   Guinness said it earned 474 million pounds, or $867 million, up
from 113 million pounds in 1986.
   The company attributed the increase to one-time gains of 217
million pounds, including 29 million pounds of unauthorized
payments relating to the April 1986 takeover of Distillers Co.
   Sales fell 9 percent to 2.82 billion pounds from 3.1 billion
pounds.
   Police have charged six people, including former Guinness
Chairman Ernest Saunders, for alleged offenses related to the
Distillers takeover.
   On Thursday, police arrested British stockbroker Anthony Parnes
in connection with the Guinness scandal when he voluntarily
returned to London after being held in a Los Angeles jail for six
months for extradition proceedings.
   Parnes, 42, who was arrested at Heathrow airport, faces 19
charges including aiding and abetting the theft of money from the
brewing company. He is accused of setting up and operating an
illegal share support operation during the Guinness takeover bid
for Distillers in 1986.
   Guinness has admitted it paid outsiders millions of pounds to
buy Guinness stock to make the brewer's cash and stock offer for
Distillers, a gin and whisky maker, more attractive than a rival
bid.
   The company did not break down its quarterly or six-month
results. Corporations are not required to do so under British law.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House budget director David A.
Stockman is quitting the Wall Street giant Salomon Brothers Inc. to
join the Blackstone Group, the smaller rival announced today.
   Stockman, a managing director at Salomon since leaving the White
House in 1985, will handle all merchant banking activities and
merger transactions for the Blackstone Group, the company said.
   His departure from Salomon comes against a background of turmoil
within the venerable investment firm, a partial result of the
uncertain outlook for Wall Street in the aftermath of the stock
market crash five months ago.
   Several other high-ranking executives also have quit Salomon
recently, although Stockman was quoted by the New York Times today
as saying his departure was unrelated to the company's problems.
   ``My experience at Salomon was absolutely agreeable and I have a
high regard for (Salomon chairman) John Gutfreund,'' Stockman was
quoted as saying. ``...There's one thing I couldn't do there _
which is have my own shop.''
   Former Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson, chairman of
Blackstone, said in a press statement that Stockman will take
charge of a jointly owned firm called ``Stockman & Co. _ a
Blackstone Group affiliate.''
   Peterson said he wanted Stockman to bolster Blackstone's
emerging merchant banking business in Japan.
   ``Dave Stockman will be an immensely valuable asset in meeting
that goal,'' he said. ``He brings a global perspective on business
and financial issues as well as intimate familiarity with both U.S.
and Japanese government policies.''
   Blackstone recently represented Sony in a $2 billion acquisition
of CBS Records late last year and represented Firestone Tire &
Rubber Co. in its $2.6 billion acquisition by Japan's Bridgestone
Corp.
   Stockman, 41, was White House budget director from 1981 to 1985.

<HEAD>Company Will Treat Parts Unit As Separate Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The for sale sign on Chrysler Motors Corp.'s
Acustar subsidiary has been taken down, but Chrysler is pushing the
parts-making company farther from the corporate nest.
   ``The objective is to have it be much more independent,
especially in the administration, so you don't have a lot of people
in Acustar filing reports to Chrysler about what they will be
doing,'' said Baron Bates, vice president of public relations.
   The idea came up when Chrysler was reviewing whether to sell the
$3 billion subsidiary, Bates said. The company backed away from
selling Acustar after the United Auto Workers union revolted and
threatened strikes at Acustar plants where local contracts were
unresolved.
   The 10-month-old subsidiary has continued as a part of the
company's structure and functioned almost as a Chrysler Motors
department.
   ``One of the things we're contemplating in-house is ... why
don't we pretend we sold Acustar and really treat them as a
completely self-contained business responsible for their own
bottom-line results and let them do whatever they have to do to get
there?'' Acustar Chairman Robert Lutz said.
   Acustar financial results would be reported with Chrysler's, and
Chrysler still would handle the company's labor relations, but
Acustar no longer would report to Chrysler administratively, Bates
said.
   One reason Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca said Chrysler
considered selling Acustar was the expense of research and
development necessary for competitive parts technology.
   Lutz said part of Acustar's strategy would involve buying new
technology and forming partnerships with parts companies rather
than developing new technology on its own.
   The idea has been endorsed by Chrysler's executive committee and
Lutz has been urged to complete the change quickly, he said. He
declined to be more specific about a timetable.
   Of the Big Three automakers, Chrysler purchases more of its
parts from outside suppliers than industry leader General Motors
Corp. or Ford Motor Co.

   Chevron Corp. plans to add more than 1,500

staff since the oil company bought Gulf in 1984.
   The addition would include more than 300 workers in the San

   The company, the fourth-largest oil company in the nation, has
13,400 workers in the San Francisco area, including 2,748 at its

   Nearly half of the new employees will work in exploration. The
company will hire 400 workers to help find and produce oil in the
United States alone. In addition, 100 people will be involved in
exploration work in Canada and 160 will be hired for other nations.

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary Baker Opposes Disclosure of Foreign Investors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III told
Congress on Thursday that disclosing names of foreign investors
would damage the United States.
   Proposals for some disclosure are in trade bills now before
Congress.
   ``If enacted, the ... provision would have a chilling effect on
foreign investment in the United States _ thereby costing jobs,
raising interest rates, lowering productivity, closing off
opportunities for technological and managerial improvements, and
undermining our efforts to liberalize investments abroad,'' Baker
said.
   His opposition was in a written statement sent to the Senate
Commerce Committee. Sponsors of the proposal, Sen. Tom Harkin and
Rep. John Bryant, came to a committee hearing and said they were
sorry Baker did not appear in person.
   ``Not one of the G-7 countries (United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Canada, Italy) has a publicly available
national register of foreign investments of the type prescribed by
Bryant,'' Baker wrote.
   ``Not one discloses to the public ongoing information about the
status of specific private investors and their investments; not one
requires systematic reporting by foreign investors or domestic
firms for this purpose.''
   Baker's views were challenged by Harkin, though he did not refer
to Baker. Harkin said most countries require more information than
his bill is seeking, and in addition require their governments to
clear investments in advance. His proposal does not seek that kind
of clearance.
   ``Even Switzerland keeps a public registry of Swiss companies
with foreign ownership,'' he said.
   ``Japan's preclearance process seems one of the most stringent,
in part because it is the most explicit ... Japan flatly prohibits
foreign ownership of more than 25 percent in any of its high-tech
companies.''

<TEXT>
   New Zealand investor Ronald Brierly is
offering $988 million to take over CalMat Co., a major construction
materials and real estate concern with operations in Southern
California and Arizona.
   Brierly made his unsolicited $40-per-share offer for the 81
percent of CalMat he does not already own through a subsidiary of
Australia-based Industrial Equity (Pacific) Inc., CalMat said
Wednesday.
   CalMat has 30.5 million shares outstanding.
   Los Angeles-based CalMat was created in 1984 by the merger of
two construction industry giants _ California Portland Cement Co.
and Conrock Co. The merged companies' core businesses are in
cement, ready-mixed concrete, aggregate, hot-mixed asphalt and real
estate holdings.
   Brierly's offer sent CalMat's stock soaring by $13.50 per share
to $45.37{ in heavy trading Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock was up $1.87| on Tuesday amid speculation the
company might become a takeover target.
   In a brief statement, CalMat chief executive A.F. Gerstell said
that in the past three years the company ``has taken significant
steps...to enhance shareholder value through the disposition of
assets and the reallocation of proceeds to the company's
higher-margin core businesses.''
   In addition, Gerstell said, the company and its investment
adviser, J.P. Morgan & Co., have for some time been looking at
``additional, more aggressive steps which the company can take to
continue this ongoing process.''
   CalMat intends to convene a special board meeting to compare
Brierly's offer with its own restructuring options, Gerstell said.
   In 1987, the company earned $78.1 million on revenue of $658.9
million. The profit included a $24 million gain on the sale of
assets. In 1986, CalMat earned $44.1 million on revenue of $619
million.
   Gerstell has been CalMat's chief executive, president and chief
operating officer since the company was created. For the previous
three years, he was presdient of California Portland Cement.
   CalMat's chairman, William Jenkins, was president of Conrock
before the merger.
   Brierly, whose holdings range from real estate to oil and gas to
financial services, characterizes himself as a long-term investor
but not necessarily a passive one.
   In 1986, he made an unsuccessful bid to acquire control of
Beverly Hills-based Wrather Corp., best known as the operator of
the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim and the Spruce Goose and Queen Mary
tourist attractions in Long Beach.
   Subsequently, a joint venture of Brierly and Burbank-based Walt
Disney Co. bought Wrather for $152 million. Disney has become
manager of the Disneyland Hotel, which sits on its property, but no
agreement has been reached on how the assets will be split.

<HEAD>Sexual Payoffs Charged by Justice Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department today charged a former
Texas savings and loan executive with providing sexual payoffs to
the institution's officers and board members in a conspiracy to
violate the federal bank and bribery statute.
   John Hill, former vice president of Vernon Savings and Loan
Association, arranged for paid female companionship for officers
and directors at a three-day June 1985 board meeting in Solana
Beach, Calif., said a one-count felony information.
   Hill, who the Justice Department said has agreed to plead
guilty, intended that sexual favors would be available to the
executives in connection with their service to the institution,
said court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Dallas.
   According to a Justice Department statement, Hill and others
created false board minutes on the renewal and extension of some
commercial real estate loans. The bogus minutes indicated the
renewals and extensions had been approved by the board when no such
approval had occurred.
   Hill falsified documentation justifying $100,000 in payments to
a consultant in connection with a loan from an S&L, according to
papers filed in federal court in Dallas.
   In addition, according to the felony information, Hill conspired
with a Vernon official to make $5,400 in illegal state and federal
campaign contributions to specific candidates, based on the
understanding that he would be reimbursed through false expense
vouchers submitted to Vernon.
   The contributions allegedly included $1,000 to former Texas
congressman Thomas Loeffler in February 1986, $2,000 to the
Loeffler for Government campaign in April 1986, $400 to the
campaign of U.S. Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, in September 1985, and
$2,000 to Citizens for Jack Kemp in June 1986.
   There were no allegations that any of the campaign organizations
or candidates knew the contributions were actually coming from the
S&L.
   Disguising payments to the consultant and concealing
reimbursements for the illegal campaign contributions impeded the
Internal Revenue Service in determining the amount of income taxes
due by the consultant, by Hill, by Vernon and by the association's
holding company, Dondi Financial Corp.
   Hill, who has agreed to cooperate in an ongoing probe of Vernon,
could be sentenced to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on
the conspiracy charge.

   Rolls-Royce PLC, the airplane engine maker
privatized by the government last year, on Thursday reported a 12
percent increase in its net profit for 1987.
   Strong gains in the group's civil aviation division more than
offset a sharp rise in research and development costs, the company
said.
   Rolls-Royce, which is a separate company from the luxury car
maker, reported 1987 net profit of 134 million pounds, or $247
million, up from 120 million pounds, or $221 million a year earlier.
   Per share earnings came to 20.1 pence, or 37 cents, compared
with 18.9 pence, or 35 cents, a year earlier.
   Sales increased 14 percent to 2.06 billion pounds, or $3.8
billion, from 1.8 billion pounds, or $3.3 billion in 1986.
   Rolls-Royce Chairman Sir Francis Tombs said: ``Our order book is
strong and our wide stable of competitive engines gives us an
excellent opportunity to consolidate our existing customer base and
secure some of the attractive new sales opportunities which are
appearing around the world.''
   The company did not break out quarterly or six-month results. It
isn't required to under British law.

last year's estimated total and 10 million below the 1986 record.
   Production of 525 million metric tons would fail to satisfy
projected demand for 1988, but current stocks could be used to make
up the shortfall, the council said.
   ``In the short- to medium-term, there should be no need for
great anxiety,'' it added.

   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade due to a late surge of
speculative buying. Grain futures closed mixed.
   The soybean runup in the last 1{ hours of trading coincided with
a rally in silver futures prices that may have sparked buying
interest in soybeans, said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``There was no new fundamental news during the session but
sometimes the soybeans will trade with the precious metals
markets,'' he said.
   ``The grain markets had looked strong before today and the rise
in silver prices may have led to inflationary ideas,'' Spilka said.
   The dollar also weakened Thursday, making U.S. goods cheaper
overseas. Expectations that the dollar will remain weak against
other currencies may also have supported the soybean market, he
said.
   At the close, wheat was \ cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.07 a bushel; corn was { cent to

<TEXT>
   Business phone costs held steady in the first
three months of 1987, the first quarter since 1984 in which they
have have not fallen, according to a report Thursday.
   A 10 percent rise in rates for interstate private lines offset
declines of 7 percent in rates for both WATS and toll calls, said
CCMI-McGraw-Hill, which conducts the quarterly survey.
   The firm's Telecommunications Price Index remained level at
77.3, down from a base of 100 in 1984.
   The big three long-distance companies seem to be adjusting their
rates to make it attractive for business customers to switch from
private lines to WATS and toll service, said George Christie, chief
economist for McGraw-Hill Information Systems Co.
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. dominates the interstate
long-distance market, with MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint
Communications Co. trailing.
   The cost of local business calling remained stable during the
period.
   Christie said any changes in phone rates in the final days of
the month would have an insignificant effect on the first-quarter
index.

<HEAD>State Fighting Suit That Could Cost $140 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court challenge to a Florida tax on
insurance premiums and annuities will decide whether the Department
of Revenue owes out-of-state insurance companies $140 million in
refunds.
   The companies don't like the way the state currently assesses
taxes on money that consumers pay to insurers _ a 2 percent tax on
premiums and 1 percent tax on annuities.
   The tax is paid only by out-of-state companies, not by
Florida-based insurers. The out-of-state companies say that isn't
fair, and many of them have asked for refunds.
   The law was changed last year to require all insurance
companies, including those based in Florida, to pay the premium
insurance tax, but that change won't take effect until July 1.
   The state targeted one case _ Continental Insurance Co. _ to be
a test case in circuit court.
   ``If (the case) comes down in our favor, we'll be all right
financially,'' said Walter Wood, an attorney in the Department of
Banking and Finance, one of three state agencies in the case. ``If
not, there's a lot of money involved.''
   New York-based Continental sought a refund of $1.5 million that
it paid in taxes in 1983, 1984 and 1985. It is one of 210 companies
that have filed for a total of $140 million in refunds _ an amount
roughly equal to the entire budget for the Department of Banking
and Finance.
   ``It's substantial,'' said Daniel Brown of the Department of
Legal Affairs, which is handling the case.
   In its refund claim, Continental argued that the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled in 1985 that such disriminatory taxing policies were
unconstitutional.
   According to the state comptroller's office, out-of-state
insurance companies have filed claims to recover taxes paid as long
ago as the mid-1970s.
   Brown argued on the state's behalf that the Florida tax law
should be considered legal until courts rule on its
constitutionality.
   Brown also claimed that the out-of-state insurance companies
passed along the tax to consumers through its premiums and
refunding the money would unjustly enrich the companies.
   The Department of Banking and Finance is involved because the
comptroller rules on requests for tax refunds. The Department of
Revenue both collects the tax and makes the refunds, while the
Department of Insurance regulates the insurance industry.

   Stock prices took a sharp drop Thursday as the
dollar slumped in foreign exchange and U.S. interest rates headed
higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 43.77 points to
2,023.87.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 5 to 1 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 269 up, 1,379 down and 347 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 184.91 million shares, against 167.37
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index dropped
2.82 to 149.00.
   As the dollar lost ground, prices of long-term government bonds
fell about $5 for each $1,000 in face value during the morning,
putting their yields in the 8.75 to 8.8 percent range. At their
best recent levels, yields on Treasury bonds were as low as 8.3
percent.
   Bonds later recovered a good part of their early losses, but
stocks did not follow suit.
   Analysts said pressure on the dollar prompted concern in markets
around the world. Prices fell in both the London and Tokyo stock
markets.
   Against that background, brokers said, investors moved quickly
to cash on the U.S. market's gains since late last year.
   Thursday's session marked the fourth time the Dow Jones
industrial average came close to, but did not quite reach, the
50-point plus or minus limit set by the NYSE Feb. 4 at which
restrictions go into effect on the use of its computer trading
facilities for so-called index arbitrage trading.
   Though this ``collar,'' as exchange officials call it, has never
been activated, many Wall Streeters say it appears to have become a
sort of de facto limit on daily price swings, and possibly a target
for traders as well.
   Among actively traded blue chip and technology issues, General
Electric dropped } to 41~; International Business Machines 1~ to
109}; Digital Equipment 3} to 107|, and American Telephone &
Telegraph { to 27}.
   Digital Equipment, which has a wide following among investing
institutions as a leading technology company, dropped below its
lowest point in the October crash.
   In the securities industry group, Merrill Lynch fell } to 23{;
Salomon 1[ to 21\; First Boston 1[ to 25; Morgan Stanley } to 59\,
and Charles Schwab ] to 8\.
   Some stocks involved in takeover developments bucked the
downtrend. Irving Bank, which jumped 6| to 66\, said that it was
negotiating with unnamed ``third parties'' about a possible merger,
restructuring or sale of assets as an alternative to a hostile bid
by Bank of New York.
   International Clinical Laboratories climbed 8 to 33} in
over-the-counter trading. Smithkline Beckman made a $32-a-share bid
for the company, which had agreed to an acquisition by Corning
Glass Works for $26 a share.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $46.65 billion, or 1.75
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 215.22 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 6.72 to 305.31,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 5.56 at 263.35.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar continued to slide Thursday, reaching
levels against the Japanese yen and West German mark not seen for
two months as a bearish sentiment pervaded currency markets.
   Gold prices firmed. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid price for gold of $453.15 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up
from Wednesday's late bid of $451.15 an ounce.
   Traders said the dollar continued to suffer from comments made
Wednesday by Martin Feldstein, former chief economic advisor to the
president, who said the currency should fall to 120 yen in the near
term.
   In an address at New York University, Feldstein also predicted
the dollar would decline against other currencies over the next
several years.
   ``Those comments are not new, but they triggered losses'' in the
dollar, said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Irving Trust Co.
   The dollar, which closed at 125.575 yen in New York, last traded
at that level in mid-January. Traders said the yen continues to
strengthen ahead of the close of the Japanese fiscal year on March
31 and on the expectation that the Japanese economy will forge
ahead.
   The dollar also weakened somewhat on government reports that
personal income grew 0.9 percent in February and that personal
consumption expenditures grew 0.7 percent during the month.
   The figures indicated that consumer spending is picking up
again, which likely will result in wider trade deficits, said Nigel
Green, a trader at EBC-Amro Bank in London.
   Johnson echoed that sentiment, saying that the ``mildly bearish
sentiment'' toward the dollar is being spurred by ``the realization
that there will be larger trade deficits later in the year.''
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar closed at 126.30 yen, down 0.85 yen. Later in London, it was
quoted at a lower rate of 125.75 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8435 from Wednesday's
$1.8358. In New York, it cost $1.8420 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Wednesday's $1.83725.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Wednesday,
included: 1.67725 West German marks, down from 1.6916; 1.38625
Swiss francs, down from 1.3985; 5.7045 French francs, down from
5.7470; 1,242.50 Italian lire, down from 1,251.875, and 1.2421
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2430.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.6800 West German marks, down from 1.6915; 1.3885 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3990; 5.7120 French francs, down from 5.7450;
1.8980 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9005; 1,246.95 Italian lire,
down from 1,253.25, and 1.2426 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2434.
   Gold prices moved mostly higher. On the New York Commodity
Exchange, gold closed at $454.10, up from $451.10 an ounce
Wednesday.
   In London gold fell to a late bid price of $452 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $453. In Zurich, gold rose to close
at a bid $452, compared with $450.50 late Wednesday. Earlier, in
Hong Kong, gold rose $3.34 to close at $455.40 an ounce.
   Silver closed at $6.735 an ounce on New York's Comex, up from
$6.610 on Wednesday. In London, the metal was trading at a late bid
price of $6.61 a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $6.63.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply jumped in mid-March, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The report had no impact on interest rates in the credit
markets, however.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose $11.2 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $2,965.5 billion in the week ended March 14
from $2,954.3 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased $14.8 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,740.3 billion from $3,725.5 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose $4.7 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $760.5 billion from $755.8 billion. For
the latest 13 weeks, M1 rose 2.6 percent to an average of $755.7
billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In setting its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   The Fed said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for
M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly
lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The Fed
has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $48 million in
the week ended March 16 compared with a decline of $1.24 billion a
week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $325 million a day in the week ended
Wednesday, up from $153 million in the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $274.2 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $272.1 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Silver, Copper Futures Surge On GNP Growth, Inflation Signals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices for future delivery of silver and copper posted steep
gains Thursday on expections of increasing demand among industrial
users of the metals.
   Gold futures prices also advanced on perceptions of rising
inflation.
   On other markets, soybean futures surged while grain futures
were mixed; stock-index futures fell; energy futures and livestock
and meat futures were mixed.
   Wednesday's government figures showing the economy grew at a
higher-than-expected 4.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 1987
had a delayed impact on silver and copper futures on New York's
Commodity Exchange, said Bernard Savakl, a metals analyst for
PaineWebber.
   ``Silver and copper are industrial metals that have to play
catch-up on the upside now following the GNP report,'' Savakl said.
``What the government is saying is contrary to the majority of
expectations: the economy did not slow to a grinding halt but
gathered upward momentum, and that's very positive for industrial
metals.''
   Silver, which is also a precious metal and thus perceived as an
investment hedge against inflation, also gained in reaction to
generally higher futures prices for other commodities, Savakl said.
   The Commodities Research Bureau's index of 21 commodity markets
gained 1.25 points Thursday, a moderate advance.
   Analyst Stephen W. Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,
attributed the silver rally to Far Eastern buying of the metal and
to the dollar's decline in value against foreign currencies.
   Platt also noted that copper is in short supply. Tight supplies
of copper have been cited to explain the metal's steady increase in
value since late February.
   Copper settled .50 cent to 6.25 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $1.1395 a pound.
   Gold settled $2.20 to $3 higher with April at $454.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 12.5 cents to 13.4 cents higher with March at
$6.735 a troy ounce.
   The silver rally may have sparked buying interest in soybean
futures, which gained as much as 9{ cents a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Grains were mixed.
   ``There was no new fundamental news during the session but
sometimes the soybeans will trade with the precious metals
markets,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``The grain markets had looked strong before today and the rise
in silver prices may have led to inflationary ideas,'' he said.
   Expectations that the dollar will remain weak, making U.S. goods
cheaper overseas, may also have supported the soybean market, he
said.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 2 cents lower with May at $3.06} a
bushel; corn was } cent to 1\ cents higher with May at $2.07 a
bushel; oats were } cent to 1\ cents higher with May at $1.68{ a
bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 9{ cents higher with May at $6.49\
a bushel.
   Stock-index futures tumbled on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 6.30 points lower at 264.10.
   Stock and stock-index futures prices opened sharply lower in
reaction to the dollar's weakness and continued to fall throughout
the session, said John Mitchell, an analyst for Elders Futures Inc.
   Oil prices finished mixed in moderate trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, reflecting uncertainty over the OPEC pricing
committee's ability to calm the turbulent market, analysts said.
   The group meets next month to discuss stabilizing sagging prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 10 cents
higher with May at $16.96 a barrel; heating oil was .16 cent to .41
cent lower with April at 47.40 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .20 cent lower to .08 cent higher with April at 47.33 cents a
gallon.
   Cattle futures finished mostly lower and pork futures were
mostly higher in a day of choppy trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Traders were wary of the sharp drop in stock prices, fearing a
repeat of the cattle market collapse that followed the stock
market's historic plunge in October, said Charlie Richardson, an
analyst in Denver with Lind-Waldock & Co.
   ``Everbody was keeping an eye on the indexes and what the stock
market was doing,'' he said.
   Live cattle settled .53 cent lower to .05 cent higher with April
at 74.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .65 cent
lower with March at 82.20 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower
to .40 cent higher with April at 46.07 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .35 cent to .60 cent higher with March at 55.45 cents
a pound.

   The losing side vowed to fight on Thursday after
a federal bankruptcy judge approved an $11 million settlement in a

   Prudential Insurance Co. of America agreed this week to pay
about $11 million to United States Lines to settle legal claims
stemming from a clerical error in which a mortgage lien Prudential
held on eight ships, worth $92,885,000, was recorded as worth
$92,885.
   Prudential agreed to pay the money to keep United States Lines
and other creditors from challenging the full amount of the lien.
   Ms. Mayerson said her client, General Electric Capital Corp.,
which shared a second mortgage on the ships, would press its
challenge in Admiralty Court and might even appeal the ruling
Thursday by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman III.
   If General Electric Capital can convince a judge that
Prudential's lien is really worth only $92,885, it will get a
bigger portion of the more than $60 million in net proceeds raised
by the sale of the eight ships.
   The oddity of a clerical error costing Prudential more than $11
million attracted widespread attention to the case. But it was not
a major case in the legal annals, said Sheldon Hirshon, a lawyer
for another creditor, Sea-going Benefit Plans, which went along
with the settlement.
   ``This is not Brown vs. Board of Education,'' Hirshon said,
referring to the landmark 1954 school desegregation case.

   Pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beckman
Corp. on Thursday launched a $32-a-share tender offer for
International Clinical Laboratories Inc., which already has
accepted a bid from Corning Glass Works.
   SmithKline valued its offer for the clinical testing firm at
$340 million, which includes the assumption of debt. SmithKline
owns about 1 percent of ICL's 7.6 million outstanding shares.
   In over-the-counter trading, ICL jumped $8 to close at $33.75 a
share.
   ICL, based in Nashville, Tenn., announced earlier this month
that it reached a definitive agreement to be acquired by Corning's
MetPath Inc. subsidiary for $26 a share, or about $260 million.
   A spokesman at Corning headquarters in Corning, N.Y., had no
comment on whether the company might increase its bid.
   Analysts said, however, that Corning, which earned $162.2
million last year, is financially capable of challenging SmithKline.
   ``Corning can go considerably higher if they found it
worthwhile,'' said Charles K. Ryan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &
Co. in New York.
   Under terms of its merger agreement, Corning has an option to
buy 3 million unissued ICL shares as well as ``all the shares owned
by certain directors and officers'' for $26 each.
   Ryan said the directors and officers hold 800,000 shares, which
would value the options at about $99 million. Companies sometimes
grant such ``lock-up'' options to keep others at bay by making a
subsequent bids more expensive.
   Henry Wendt, chairman and chief executive officer of
Philadelphia-based SmithKline, said in a statement that the offer
is ``consistent with our corporate strategy to invest in our key
businesses and will build on the success of our clinical
laboratories network.''
   SmithKline Bio-Science Laboratories, the company's clinical
laboratory segment headquartered in King of Prussia, Pa., operates
22 regional laboratories. It reported sales of $431 million last
year.
   SmithKline is ``No. 1, and they want to get even bigger'' by
acquiring ICL, said David Lippman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   Corning's MetPath subsidiary, which is headquartered in
Teterboro, N.J., operates a testing laboratory there as well as 12
others nationwide.
   ICL's 13 clinical testing laboratories are located in the South
and West. The company has a substantial contract to conduct AIDs
tests on 27,000 federal prisoners in 47 prisons and recently
announced the opening of a new division in Nashville to market its
laboratory testing service to the insurance industry nationwide.
   For the fiscal year ended last Aug. 31, ICL reported profits of
$4.8 million on sales of $205.5 million.
   As a condition of its offer, which expires at midnight April 20,
SmithKline said that two Tennessee laws governing takeovers must be
found invalid or inapplicable.
   Corning's offer expires April 5.

   Lufthansa German Airlines has ordered 20 Boeing
737 airliners and taken options on 20 more of the twin-engined
jets, Boeing Commercial Airplanes said Wednesday.
   Under terms of the order, worth approximately $535 million,
Lufthansa will begin receiving the new aircraft in October 1990,
with deliveries continuing through May 1991, said Boeing spokesman
Tom Cole.
   Cole said the jets will be a mix of 141-passenger 737-300s and
98-passenger 737-500s, but the number of each type of plane has not
yet been decided.
   The 737-500 is the smallest commercial jet Boeing sells. It is
now under development and is scheduled to be introduced in February
1990.
   The 737-500 is nearly identical to the 737-300, except that at
97 feet, 9 inches it is 7 feet, 10 inches shorter. Crews rated for
one model can also fly the other.
   Lufthansa plans to use the new aircraft to replace older
aircraft in its fleet, Cole said. The new planes will be powered by
CFM56-3B1 engines made by General Electric of the United States and
SNECMA of France.
   Lufthansa, which bought the first 737 from Boeing in 1965, now
has ordered 90 of the planes.
   Boeing has now received 2,028 orders for all 737 models, the
most-popular commercial jetliner ever made.

<HEAD>Davis, Snubbed in Lorimar Bid, Weighs Suit, Hostile Tender Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Marvin Davis, snubbed in his $770
million takeover bid for Lorimar Telepictures Corp., sought
Wednesday to turn up the heat in his fight for the entertainment
concern.
   Davis said he would consider other ``alternative courses of
action'' if Lorimar continues to hold merger talks only with Warner
Communications Inc., the New York-based entertainment conglomerate.
   A Lorimar spokesman said those options included filing suit
against Lorimar or making a hostile tender offer.
   Noting that the price of Lorimar stock has risen more than 50
percent since Lorimar disclosed on March 3 that it was talking with
Warner, Davis said, ``I believe you have passed the point of no
return ... It is time to quickly and efficiently provide equal
access (to non-public information) to all serious bidders.''
   He added, ``It is upsetting to me, as it must be to all
shareholders, that only one of the parties interested in acquiring
LT has had the opportunity to inspect its books and records.''
   Davis is offering $17 per share for Lorimar's 45.3 million
shares. No details of the price being discussed by Warner has been
disclosed, but analysts have estimated could fetch a price in the
high teens.
   The company's stock closed unchanged at $15 a share Wednesday on
the American Stock Exchange.
   Davis also indicated that he owned a ``substantial block'' of
Lorimar stock. A spokesman said it was less than the 5 percent
which an investor must disclose and most, if not all, of the stock
was acquired before Davis made his takeover proposal on March 7.
   Lorimar spokeswoman Sue Binford said Wednesday that the company
had no comment on Davis' announcement and declined to comment on
the status of talks with Warner.
   Lorimar dismissed Davis' proposal in rather summary fashion just
hours after it was disclosed two weeks ago, saying only that it
``would bear Davis' letter in mind.''
   Lorimar, based in suburban Culver City, is a leading producer of
original television programming, but in recent years has been
troubled as its ambitious plans to expand into other areas have
disintegrated and sometimes caused hevy losses for the company.
   In the first nine months of its current fiscal year, Lorimar
lost $82.6 million on revenues of $616.8 million. The deficit
included $45 million in writedowns on five movies and $22 million
in reserves for possible future losses in its home-video unit.

<HEAD>Motorola To Pay $16.7 Million In Fines For Navy Mischarges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc.'s electronics group has agreed
to pay the government $16.7 million and to plead guilty to a
criminal information accusing it of mischarging for labor and
materials on Navy satellite and missile contracts, the Justice
Department announced Thursday.
   In documents filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, Motorola's
Government Electronics Group in Scottsdale, Ariz., was accused of
inflating costs for a component of a Navy satellite communications
and mischarging $2.5 million in labor, materials and other costs.
The money actually was spent on other work, the government said.
   The Defense Department, relying on the inflated amounts, paid
some $5 million more than it should have on a second contract for
the satellite communications system, said the government.
   Motorola, one of the nation's top 50 defense contractors, agreed
to plead guilty to three counts of making false statements.
   The firm said in a statement from Motorola headquarters in
Schaumburg, Ill., that ``it is now clear in retrospect'' that the
electronics group's ``systems were not adequate to ensure total
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.''
   ``The conduct of the employees involved in these programs failed
to conform to Motorola's own internal standards,'' the statement
added. The electronics group ``has greatly expanded its compliance
efforts'' with reforms which ``are now an integral part of the way
GEG does business.''
   Under the agreement, which still must be approved by a court,
the government has agreed not to prosecute the company further on
the contracts, but reserves the right to prosecute individuals.
   The court documents also say the firm mischarged labor costs for
work on 10 contracts involving production of target detecting
devices for the Navy's Standard missile.
   The third count in the criminal information said Motorola
mischarged labor costs on a contract for the production of
targeting detecting devices for the Navy's Phoenix missile.
   Motorola will pay $16.7 million in criminal fines, restitution
and civil penalties. The company already has paid $6.8 million to
the Defense Department.
   The pleas result from an investigation into labor and materials
charging and pricing practices by Motorola from 1979 to 1984.

   A federal bankruptcy court judge rejected on
Thursday a financial reorganization plan for Elsinore Corp.'s
Atlantis Casino Hotel, but attorneys for the gaming hall say they
are confident they can amend the proposal to the judge's
satisfaction.
   Judge Rosemary Gambardella, in a 90-page decision, objected to a
proposal that Elsinore would be free from future claims if any were
filed.
   ``The present release and discharge provisions of the plan stand
as an obstacle to confirmation of the plan as presently
constituted,'' she wrote.
   She said, however, she would consider amendments to the plan if
the company wanted to submit changes.
   Marvin E. Jacob, attorney for the Atlantis, said he will move to
eliminate the offending provision of the reorganization plan,
perhaps as early as Friday.
   The Atlantis, a casino hotel in Atlantic City, has been
operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since November
1985.
   After the court ruling, Atlantis President Jeanne Hood told the
state Casino Control Commission he was confident the reorganization
plan is still viable. The commission is in the midst of relicensing
hearings for the Atlantis.
   The Atlantis has more than 15,000 creditors, but the pay-back
plan concentrates on about 700 main creditors.
   Under the reorganization plan, Elsinore will raise $70 million
by refinancing its two Nevada casinos and will receive about $20
million from the sale of a note.

<HEAD>One Client Drops Ad Agency, Another Puts Account Up for Review</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York television station said Thursday it
was dropping WPP Group PLC's Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein unit
as its advertising agency, and another Lord Geller client said it
would review its ad assignment.
   Meanwhile, a New York state court judge set a hearing for Monday
on the agency's request for an injunction against a half-dozen
former top Lord Geller executives who left the agency abruptly last
week to start their own ad firm.
   The executives have indicated they felt constrained under the
management of WPP Group, the British firm that acquired Lord Geller
in July 1987.
   Since the executives quit, about 20 other Lord Geller employees
have followed their former bosses to the new agency, Lord,
Einstein, O'Neill & Partners.
   Lord Geller has filed suit in New York State Supreme Court to
try to prevent the former executives from signing its clients and
hiring its workers for their new agency.
   Lord Geller employs more than 300 people and handles billings of
about $245 million. Billings are what companies spend on
advertising; agencies usually get a percentage of billings for
their work.
   WNBC-TV, a New York television station that has been a client of
Lord Geller for four years, said it had notified WPP Group's chief
executive, Martin Sorrell, that it was assigning its ad business to
the new agency.
   Linda Lipman, director of advertising and promotions for the
station, said station executives felt they had built up a special
relationship with Richard Lord, the former chairman and chief
executive of Lord Geller who resigned to start the new firm, and
would be ``better serviced'' at the new agency.
   Separately, Fuji Photo Film USA Inc., based in Elmsford, N.Y.,
said it was planning to review its advertising accounts now being
handled by Lord Geller.
   Lord Geller is the agency for Fuji divisions that market audio
and video tape and floppy disks.
   Gene Kern, advertising manager for Fuji's magnetic products
division, said the decision was made ``after studying recent
changes at the agency.''
   He said Fuji planned to invite specific agencies to participate
in the review but declined to say if Lord Geller or Lord Einstein
would be invited.
   Neither WNBC-TV nor Fuji would say how much they billed through
Lord Geller. A third Lord Geller client, New Yorker magazine, has
already indicated that it plans to drop the agency and sign on with
the new firm.
   Lord Geller's biggest account is International Business Machines
Corp., based in Armonk, N.Y. IBM reportedly accounts for about half
of Lord Geller's total billings, and has said it is ``concerned''
about recent events at the agency and has told the agency so.

   The U.S. dollar slid further against the Japanese
yen in early trading Friday in Tokyo following an overnight decline
in New York, and stock prices fell sharply.
   The dollar opened at 125.68 yen, down from Thursday's close of
126.30 yen.
   Ken Iiya of the Bank of Tokyo, said buyers were supporting the
dollar somewhat, keeping the currency above its overnight close of
125.575 yen in New York, its lowest level there since mid-January.
   He said trading was quiet due to the absence of market-affecting
news on the week's final day of currency dealings.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, down 113.95 points on Thursday, fell another
252.84 points, or 0.98 percent, to 25,528.44 in the first 25
minutes of trading.
   Share prices in the first section were lower across the board as
almost all issues posted losses, dealers said.

<HEAD>Southdown Ups Offer For Moore McCormack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southdown Inc. has increased its offer to take
over Moore McCormack Resources Inc. to $40 in cash and securities
per share, the company said Thursday.
   Southdown, which previously had offered $35 cash a share to
acquire the Connecticut-based cement and energy company, made the
sweetened offer in a letter to Paul R. Tregurtha, chairman and
chief executive officer of Stanford, Conn.-based Moore McCormack.
   Southdown offered to pay $35 cash plus debt securities valued at
$5 for each of Moore McCormack's 12.8 million common shares
outstanding, an indicated total value of $512 million. Southdown
also has offered to acquire Moore McCormack preferred stock and
subordinated debt.
   The proposal came one day after Moore McCormack unveiled a
defensive recapitalization plan under which it would borrow up to
$420 million and sell assets to finance a special dividend to
shareholders of $24.60 per share in cash and debt securities with a
face value of $6.62 per share.
   In the letter to Moore McCormack, Southdown president and chief
executive Clarence C. Comer said the securities contained in its
sweetened offer would carry the same financial terms as those
offered under Moore McCormack's recapitalization plan.
   Moore McCormack's board has rejected Southdown's $35 a share
cash offer and an earlier $31 a share bid that began the takeover
battle on Feb. 23.
   Officials from Moore McCormack could not be reached for comment
Thursday afternoon.
   Both firms are in the cement and concrete businesses, with minor
holdings in oil and gas.
   Also Thursday, a Southdown subsidiary, SDW Inc., amended its
pending tender offer to increase the price to be paid for share of
common stock of Moore McCormack to $40 per share. SDW offered to
decrease the maximum number of common shares that it would purchase
in the tender offer to about 11.4 million shares, on a fully
diluted basis.
   Southdown's offer expires at midnight on Wednesday, April 6,
unless extended.
