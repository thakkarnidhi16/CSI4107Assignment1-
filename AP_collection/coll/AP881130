   Gwendolyn Cafritz, known as one of Washington's
top hostesses for several decades, died of cancer Tuesday at her
home. She was 78.
   Mrs. Cafritz gave elegant and lavish parties from the end of
World War II until the early 1970s, when failing health curtailed
her social schedule.
   Her husband, millionare Washington real estate developer and
businessman Morris Cafritz, died in 1964. After his death, she
became president of the Cafritz Foundation, which gave about $6
million a year to local organizations devoted to the arts, community
service, health and education.
   The Cafritz party guests ranged from the Duke and Duchess of
Windsor _ who once danced on a transparent dance floor lighted from
below _ to Supreme Court justices. But President Harry Truman
favored Mrs. Cafritz's competitor, Washington ``hostess with the
mostess'' Perle Mesta.
   Mrs. Cafritz, born in Budapest, Hungary, moved to Washington in
the 1920s and began entertaining in post-World War II years. In June
1986 she gave her last large party, which was described as a ``trip
back into Washington social history.''
   In 1969, four masked men broke into her mansion, bound and gagged
Mrs. Cafritz and others, and escaped with more than $1 million in
furs and jewelry.

   Technicians used glue for a quick fix
on Atlantis' nose Wednesday and began loading the space shuttle with
fuel for a Thursday launch on a top-secret military mission. An
approaching storm loomed as the only obstacle to liftoff.
   The glue was a last-minute substitute for two bolts on an access
panel that could not be tightened. Replacing them would have meant a
delay.
   After deciding the glue would hold, NASA rolled back the service
tower which has surrounded the shuttle, clearing the way to fill the
huge external fuel tank with a half-million gallons of liquid oxygen
and liquid hydrogen.
   ``Fueling is under way. That's all we can say at this point,''
NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said at 11:35 p.m.,
   The start of fueling, another of many milestones leading to a
launching, followed a late-evening weather assessment by shuttle
managers.
   The bolts were two of 10 that secure a 24-by-18 inch access cover
on the right side of the shuttle's nose. The access plate, which is
covered by 14 of the shuttle's heat protection tiles, is normally
removed before flight to fuel a tank for the steering rockets the
shuttle uses while in orbit.
   The problem surfaced as workmen replaced the cover.
   ``We have to have to have assurance that panel isn't going to
come off in flight,'' said Lisa Malone, a Kennedy Space Center
spokeswoman.
   Weathermen, meanwhile, continued to predict that there was an 80
percent chance the weather would not permit Atlantis to be launched
on Thursday.
   The forecast was for low clouds, winds up to 23 mph and a 40
percent likelihood of rain.
   ``There is a possibility that a front will come through and
things will clear out,'' said Capt. Tom Strange, an Air Force
weatherman. ``There is a slight chance of that.''
   If there is sufficient clearing, it will come toward the end of
the three-hour launch opportunity that begins at 6:32 a.m. EST,
Strange said. He predicted that Friday morning looked slightly
better, but that winds would still be a problem.
   ``Saturday is looking a little bit better,'' he said.
   Atlantis pilot Guy S. Gardner, an Air Force lieutenant colonel,
practiced emergency landings on the space center's three-mile runway
Thursday in a plane specially outfitted to handle like the shuttle.
The four other military men on the mission _ shuttle commander
Robert L. Gibson and mission specialists Richard M. Mullane, Jerry
L. Ross and William M. Shepherd _ flew in T-38 jets around the cape
to acclimate their bodies to flight.
   The shuttle reportedly is carrying a $500 million spy satellite
called Lacrosse which nearly fills the 60-foot long cargo bay.
Sources say it is to be dropped overboard and placed in a
world-girdling orbit that takes it over 80 percent of the Soviet
Union.
   Its intelligence gathering ability is such, according to sources,
that it can gather detailed radar images _ through clouds and
darkness _ to help verify compliance with arms control agreements.
It eventually will serve as a radar eye to guide America's B-2
stealth bomber.
   At this space center, the launch control room will be manned only
by personnel with top secret clearances, and the flight will be
directed from another secure control center at NASA's Johnson Space
Center in Houston. Once the satellite is released, its radioed
commands will come from an Air Force facility in Sunnyvale, Calif.
   All space-to-ground communication will be encoded and there will
be only the barest of public announcements, in contrast with the
launch-to-liftoff eavesdropping that is usual on shuttle missions.
   Lt. Col. Joe Purka, an Air Force spokesman, said the odds were
only one in five that the weather would meet minimum requirements
for landing on the runway should an emergency develop in the early
minutes of flight.
   The forecast was for clouds at 4,000 feet over the runway;
mission rules say clouds can be no lower than 8,000 feet.
   The rules include winds of no more than 19 mph from the south or
28 mph from any direction, no rain at the pad or in the flight path
and no thunderstorms within five miles.

<HEAD>Humorist Jerry Clower Is Back Home at Route 4, Liberty
^Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``Knock 'em out John'' if Jerry Clower
isn't right back on Route 4 in the very backwoods the country humor
king visits in tall tales of his youth in rural Mississippi.
   Clower's back with the Ledbetters, the Eubanks, the prize hounds
and his raccoon-chasing cousins. It's where his mama cooked chicken
for the preacher and his uncle's prize cows were gunned down in a
bird hunt gone sour.
   His new house in the Eastfork community between Liberty and
McComb in southern Mississippi must share the title ``home'' with
Yazoo City, where he and his wife of 41 years raised ``four head of
children'' and where Clower began his career as a country humorist.
   ``But it was right here at Route 4 Liberty where I first saw the
light of day,'' Clower said of his return to rural Amite County.
``We lived in Yazoo City for 35 years and we have a lot of friends
there. But after we put the last of our kids in college, mama and I
decided to go back home.''
   The Clower home is a two-story structure with large white
columns, a ``great big brick porch, hardwood flooring and a
fireplace,'' Clower said.
   ``My mother lives right here in the old home place, and my
brother Sonny, who choked the rat to death at rat killin' time, is
here too,'' said Clower, a member of the Grand Ole Opry who has
traveled the globe spreading smiles about life growing up in the
country.
   ``It's where we used to take corn to the grist mill and sugar
cane to the molasses mill,'' Clower said. ``Times have changed and
now we go to the store to buy our meal and molasses. But the sun
still comes up in the same place and the Amite River is still
running.''
   Clower said he is considering naming his 20th album with MCA
Records: ``Let There Be Liberty.''
   ``More people have died over that one word, liberty, than any
word in the history of mankind,'' said Clower, who played football
at Mississippi State before joining the Navy in World War II and
earning three battle stars and a unit citation for bravery before
age 19. ``I know what it takes to keep freedom.''
   The move does not mean Clower will be cutting back on a schedule
that includes about 200 concerts a year.
   ``I'm just as surprised about my success as a lot of other
people,'' Clower said. ``I was at the North Carolina State Fair in
Raleigh the other day and the guy who introduced me told me this was
the largest crowd at the fair on a Sunday night in 121 years.
   ``When you keep bringing them in like that, you've got to keep
going out there and doing what you love to do.''
   But the humorist said he was already enjoying his return to Amite
County.
   ``There's a special feeling about this place,'' he said. ``I woke
up the last two mornings and a couple of deer have been standing in
the back yard. There's just no place like home.''

<HEAD>Confusion Raises Fear That Christmas Is Canceled In Bethlehem, Pa.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A power outage that shut the lights on the
town's Christmas tree and a name mix-up led Bethlehem residents to
fear someone had stolen their Christmas.
   An hour after the tree-lighting ceremony Sunday in this eastern
Pennsylvania town, the lights went out.
   On Monday, residents heard broadcast reports that Christmas in
Bethlehem was canceled.
   By Tuesday, even though the Christmas lights were again shining
brightly, at least a dozen residents were concerned enough to call
the chamber of commerce to see if, indeed, the town's celebration
was off.
   Vangie Sweitzer, the chamber's assistant director, said she told
the callers, ``Yes, the celebration in Bethlehem is canceled, but
it's the other one.''
   ``The other one'' is Jesus' birthplace, in the West Bank, the
center of a Palestinian uprising against Israel's occupation.
   The deputy mayor, Hanna Nasser, announced Monday the town's
Christmas celebration was being canceled because of the uprising.
   ``No one happened to notice the dateline,'' Ms. Sweitzer said.
``We assured everyone that Christmas is on in Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania.''
   The confusion made some businessmen here nervous, she said,
because the town has a large tourist trade at Christmas time. She
estimated 45,000 people come to the town during December to see the
city's 60,000 Christmas lights.
   ``We haven't had any bus tours cancel,'' she said.
   One call came from a New Jersey woman who said she travels to the
town each year.
   ``I told her not to worry,'' Ms. Sweitzer said, ``Christmas will
come to town same as always.''

<TEXT>
   With little hope of winning the
presidency, Venezuela's minor political parties are seeking to make
inroads in Congress in national elections Dec. 4.
   They are counting on a major defection from the nation's two main
parties.
   The small parties acknowledge that their 23 presidential
candidates _ including a handful of leftists, a witchdoctor, some
retired military officers, and a former Central Bank president _
don't have a chance in the presidential balloting.
   But they say widespread voter discontent with the government's
Accion Democratica (AD) and the main opposition party, Copei, will
be shown in split-ticket voting that could yield a Congress of 182
deputies and 44 senators with no single party in control.
   It would mean a major change in recent Venezuelan voting patterns
with longer-term effects as the nation slowly decentralizes its
political system, they said.
   ``People are not happy with AD or Copei but they recognize their
candidates have the best chance to win the presidency. But their
true electoral preference will be shown in the congressional vote,''
said Freddy Munoz, secretary general of Movement to Socialism (MAS),
Venezuela's third largest electoral force.
   Most political analysts agree small parties, the larger of which
are left of center, are likely to post gains in Congress.
   They note that voters associate the country's economic slump,
about to enter its eighth year, with center-right Copei and
center-left AD.
   The crisis, caused by low oil prices, began under a Copei
administration and has continued under current AD administration of
President Jaime Lusinchi.
   Polls indicate that while over 75 percent of the electorate
express a preference for either AD's frontrunning candidate Carlos
Andres Perez or Copei's Eduardo Fernandez, only half the eligible
voters have decided to vote for one of the two parties'
congressional slates.
   The disaffection has been exacerbated by unexciting campaigns. AD
politicians bemoan the ``triumphalism'' of the party's candidates,
who have depended on Perez's popularity to sweep them into office
rather than campaigning for themselves.
   MAS, on the other hand, adopted a campaign strategy that
de-emphasized the campaign of its presidential candidate, former
guerrilla Teodoro Petkoff, in favor of its congressional candidates.
   The ticket-splitting would be a major change from recent
Venezuelan voting patterns.
   In the six elections since 1958, AD and Copei alternated in the
presidency. Since 1973 the two parties combined have garnered not
less than 88 percent of the presidential vote.
   Minor parties had just 27 seats in the last 200-member House of
Deputies, including 10 from MAS. AD had 113 seats and Copei 60 _ and
some of the small parties ally themselves with AD or Copei.
   But even if MAS gets around 15 percent of the congressional vote,
as some analysts predict, it likely would have little impact on the
direction of Venezuelan politics in the short term.
   With Venezuela's overwhelmingly strong executive branch,
congressional action is normally limited to making minor adjustments
to presidential initiatives.
   But ticket-splitting could mean a revival of MAS and the ability
of small national or regional parties to survive until the
presidential election in 1993.
   Their survival takes on more significance as the big parties
reluctantly allow some decentralization of power to take place.

   Paul Bocuse has failed to win a guidebook's highest
rating of four toques, or hats, but France's most famous chef hasn't
lost his head.
   For many in this country where food is a national obsession,
Bocuse remains ``the emperor'' of cuisine, despite the rating of
three toques, by the 1989 edition of the Gault-Millau guidebook,
which deemed his food not in step with the times.
   Bocuse shrugged off the criticisms with imperial calm.
   ``For me there is only one guidebook. That's the Michelin,'' he
said in a telephone interview from his Paul Bocuse restaurant at
Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or outside of Lyon.
   Michelin, known as the bible of gastronomy with 630,000 copies
sold annually, is considered conservative. It gives only a terse
listing of addresses, ratings and sometimes a few dishes, and
ratings up to a top of three stars.
   The 1989 edition does not come out until March, but for nearly 30
years, Bocuse has enjoyed the top three-star status _ one of just 18
restaurants in France with the honor last year.
   Gault-Millau with 200,000 copies published yearly, hits the
bookshops earlier. Its text is peppered with colorful comments,
including feisty criticism as well as praise.
   Bocuse had rated four toques since 1973, but this time
Gault-Millau gave his knuckles a severe rap, rating 26 other chefs
higher.
   ``We're not putting down Bocuse,'' said Christian Millau,
editor-in-chief of the guidebook. ``It's just that Bocuse has stayed
the same, while other chefs are getting ahead. He really hasn't
changed his menu in five years.''
   ``My clientele is 80 percent Lyonnaise,'' replied Bocuse. ``They
still like the sea bass in crust, the truffle soup, the chicken
poached in a bladder.''
   Bocuse shot to fame after he was awarded the Legion of Honor by
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1975 and supervised a menu for
the award dinner in the Elysee Palace featuring the famous truffle
soup.
   He appeared on magazine covers and television shows,
globetrotting as no chef had ever done before.
   It became a heady time for other chefs, too, who started
emulating Bocuse as celebrities. Some, like Pierre Troisgros _ later
awarded the Legion of Honor himself _ stayed close to the stock pots.
   The frequent absences of Bocuse from his restaurant began to irk
diners and critics such as Christian Millau.
   ``You can't run all over the world and still keep a perfect
restaurant,'' said Millau. ``He does have good chefs to replace him,
but it's not the same food or atmosphere.''
   Just back from Japan, where he has several luxury food shops,
Bocuse didn't deny the charge. ``Yes, I travel, and my staff of 70
is the top. But I don't consider Millau a serious critic.''
   ``I've never seen him pay his bill. His book and magazine are
truffled with ads. He's media-oriented and only interested in news
and money.''
   Inspectors from the Michelin guide, Bocuse said, ``are impartial,
anonymous and really inspect.''
   Millau says Bocuse is a ``restaurateur, not a chef. He only goes
to market for the TV camera.
   Then he added: ``Don't get me wrong. I really like the man. He
played a formidable role as a locomotive for other chefs, an
ambassador of cuisine abroad. But he became a deity, and the others
don't need that any more.''
   As for nouvelle cuisine _ a term coined by Gault and Millau and
often applied to Bocuse _ the chef says he scorns it.
   ``I ignore it,'' Bocuse says. ``I've never done it. My cuisine is
one of tradition, of produce and seasons. This respect for tradition
is coming back.''
   Millau said newer chefs have ``dared to innovate, produce cuisine
with personality.''
   ``The latest creators getting ahead of Bocuse are Jacques Chibois
at the Royal Grey in Cannes, Marc Veyrat at the Auberge de l'Eridian
in Annecy, and others,'' Millau said. ``Bocuse is a classic. You
can't put him beside the innovators.''

   A convenience store robbery was thwarted
when a clerk pulled out a bigger knife than her assailant was
brandishing, police say.
   ``She was just like Crocodile Dundee,'' said police Capt. Richard
Higgins, referring to the popular movie character who runs off a
mugger by displaying a large knife.
   The robbery attempt occurred early Monday when two men entered
the convenience store and demanded money from Aleshia Melton, the
lone clerk on duty, police said.
   One of the men held a knife and threatened to cut Ms. Melton, but
she pulled out a foot-long machete and the men fled, Higgins said.
   Higgins said Michael E. Rogers, 27, of Jackson, was arrested near
the store and charged with attempted armed robbery.
   Another cashier brought the machete to the store following a
robbery three months ago, a store employee said.

<HEAD>1991 AIDS Estimate Lowered Because High-Risk Groups Change Behavior</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA WATSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six million to 7 million people are expected to
contract AIDS by 1991, far fewer than previous estimates, because
high-risk groups are taking precautions, the World Health
Organization said.
   In March 1987, WHO said 50 million to 100 million people could be
infected by 1991 with the HIV virus that causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. That report said even that estimate ``will be
conservative if HIV penetrates and spreads through South America and
Asia.''
   In its statement Tuesday, WHO said the worldwide total of
officially reported AIDS cases climbed to 129,385 in 142 countries
in November, an increase of 4.1 percent from October.
   It estimated that the true number of AIDS victims was twice the
reported number, and that 5 million to 10 million people worldwide
already may be infected with the HIV virus. It estimated an
additional 6 million to 7 million would be infected in the next
three years.
   The virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. The disease
has no known cure.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood
products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or
syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.
   WHO has seen ``evidence for optimism in the question of people's
behavior,'' said Jonathan Mann, director of the organization's
special program on AIDS.
   ``We have seen dramatic evidence of behavior change'' in
high-risk groups such as female prostitutes, male homosexuals and
intravenous drug users of some countries, Mann told a news
conference.
   He said, for example, that in San Francisco in 1982, the
infection rate for homosexual men was about 15 percent a year. But
the figure now is 1 percent because many gay men have begun taking
precautions such as using condoms and reducing the number of sex
partners, he said.
   In Amsterdam, the comparable figure has dropped from 10 percent
in 1983 to less than 1 percent, Mann said.
   But he cautioned that ``the evidence is clear that the danger is
widespread and is continuing to spread.''
   Mann also said WHO is ``a bit optimistic'' that HIV will spread
less than earlier predicted because worldwide education programs
have been successful in informing people how to avoid getting AIDS.
   ``The world two years ago didn't know very much about AIDS,''
Mann said. But he said surveys in some countries show that at least
95 percent of those questioned know about AIDS and know that it can
be transmitted sexually.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Dominicans are risking
their lives boating across dangerous waters to find jobs in the U.S.
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico so they can send money and presents home
for Christmas.
   ``Do you know how sad it is to approach Christmas with children
and family and have nothing to give them to eat, no clothes, not
even a ball? It breaks my heart,'' said Dominican fisherman Ramon
Antonio Sanchez.
   Sanchez was one of 232 Dominicans caught by authorities in a
five-day period that began last Thursday.
   Officials say it is the largest number arrested in Puerto Rico's
history and that the number of people attempting the passage has
increased in the weeks before Christmas.
   An untold number make it across the treacherous waters of the
90-mile Mona Passage, which separates the Dominican Republic from
Puerto Rico's western shores.
   Border Patrol Chief Joe B. Bennett estimates only about 10 to 15
percent of those entering the island are caught. He said 2,617
Dominican aliens have been arrested since April.
   Bennett said the federal agency, set up a year ago to deal with
the growing problem, lacks resources and manpower to guard 30 miles
of Puerto Rico's western coastline.
   ``This is too big an area to handle with what we've got'', said
Bennett.
   He said the Border Patrol has only 17 agents, two boats and one
plane, but that police and U.S. Coast Guard often pitch in.
   ``We don't expect it to stop before Christmas,'' he said.
   In addition to a poorly guarded coastline, Dominicans are
encouraged to make the trip because so many are sheltered and fed by
Puerto Ricans, Bennett said.
   To discourage the travelers, the Dominican government has run TV
warnings about drownings and vicious sharks eating people whose
boats capsize.
   But they didn't deter 30-year-old Sanchez.
   He and a group of 45 Dominicans were caught over the weekend
after their boat smashed against a reef near Mona Island, midway
between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.
   He said his group spent all their money to build a wooden
``yola,'' as the fragile motorboats are called. Sanchez said a bleak
economic picture this holiday season prompted the group to flee the
Dominican Republic, where inflation has risen about 60 percent and
unemployment climbed to 30 percent in the last year.
   Sanchez said he would risk the trip again given the chance.
   ``If hunger is going to kill me, I prefer to be killed escaping,
or be eaten by sharks because what I want to do is work, but there
are no jobs there,'' he said.
   Nidia Marmolejo Torres, 29, ventured the trip wearing just shorts
and T-shirt. She said she needed to feed her five children and was
hoping to work as a maid or picking coffee beans.
   ``I was willing to risk my life for this,'' she said. ``I see my
children suffering and it's killing me.''
   Many Dominicans sell their refrigerators, ovens, TV sets to come
up with the $500 to $3,000 that organizers demand for the trip.
   U.S. officials say thousands of Dominicans who make it to Puerto
Rico then go to the United States, where about 1 million Dominicans
live. Entry is easier from the commonwealth because Puerto Ricans
are U.S. citizens and have American passports.

<HEAD>Ortega Delays Judgment of Next US President; Extends Nicaraguan
Truce</HEAD>

   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, announcing
a one-month truce extension with Contra guerrillas, said he will
take a wait-and-see attitude toward the next president of the United
States.
   ``While the U.S. government doesn't show a changed attitude
toward Nicaragua, we can't change our own readiness, up to and
including the possibility of invasion by American troops. We are in
constant and permanent alert,'' Ortega said Tuesday.
   Other Nicraguan officials have said they expect a more
``pragmatic'' attitude toward Nicaragua from George Bush's
administration. Ortega said he hopes Bush will accept ``as a reality
that we survived all the efforts of a superpower to destroy the
Nicaraguan revolution.''
   Ortega, who is in Mexico City for the inauguration Thursday of
President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari, said he had no plans to
meet Secretary of State George Shultz, who will represent the United
States.
   President Reagan has steadfastly supported the Contras since he
took office in 1981, but Congress has refused to provide money for
weapons since March.
   Both the leftist Sandinista government and the Contras have
accused the other of violating the ban on offensive military action,
but Nicaragua has unilaterally extended the March 21 cease-fire on a
month-to-month basis.
   The U.S.-backed rebels, called Contras, say the truce is
indefinite and need not be formally extended every month.
   Ortega, at a news conference at the Nicaraguan ambassador's
house, said the guerrillas have violated the truce and characterized
recent Sandinista army operations as defensive in nature.
   The Nicaraguan president said the inauguration gives Central
American presidents a chance to discuss problems on an informal
basis, and said they should arrange a future meeting ``without
preconditions.''
   Presidents Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador, Jose Azcona Hoyo
of Honduras and Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala also are to attend the
inauguration, but not Oscar Arias of Costa Rica.
   Arias won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for a Central American peace
plan that was agreed upon Aug. 7, 1987, but has stalled.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras signed a cease-fire agreement
March 23 under which the rebels were to stop fighting in exchange
for democratic reforms in Nicaragua. Both sides suspended offensive
military operations and a formal truce took effect April 1.
   Talks on details of the truce agreement broke off and no
negotiations have been held since September. Most Contra fighters
have left Nicaragua for camps in Honduras.

<HEAD>Customs Service Alleges Firm Planned Illegal Shipment To Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customs officials have seized records and
electronic equipment from an import-export firm that allegedly made
an illegal agreement to ship military equipment to Iran, according
to court papers.
   The U.S. Customs Service, in papers filed in U.S. District Court,
said Aero Marketing Inc. had agreed with an undercover customs agent
to ship $1.8 million in ``military, electronic and communications
equipment'' to Iran this year.
   Federal law bans the sale of many of the items to that country,
according to the affidavit.
   Aero Marketing, based in Virginia's Fairfax County, was being
investigated as part of a ``sting'' operation centered in New York,
where an undercover customs agent was posing as an exporter, customs
officials said.
   No criminal charges have been filed against the company or its
officers, but a customs official said the investigation was
continuing.
   According to court documents, the Customs Service searched Aero
Marketing's office on Nov. 8 and a warehouse it rents on Nov. 14 and
seized unspecified goods and electronic gear.
   Derrick Manteau, a vice president of Aero Services, was
identified in the affidavit as having arranged the equipment sale.
None of the equipment reached Iran, the affidavit said.
   Manteau declined to comment on the allegations Tuesday, saying,
``Our lawyer tells us it's not something we should be discussing at
this time.''
   According to the affidavit, the undercover customs agent first
asked Manteau to ship 10 sophisticated radios to South Africa, a
transaction that would violate federal law. The radios were sent to
Frankfurt, where the Customs Service took possession of them.
   The agent then arranged the $1.8 million Iranian shipment, and
about $3,000 in equipment was shipped in August as a test and was
picked up by the Customs Service in Geneva, the affidavit said.

   The United States often has denied visas to
suspected subversives seeking U.N. credentials, but the United
Nations started protesting strenuously only when President Reagan
began barring Soviet and PLO speakers.
   Under the 1947 Headquarters Agreement between the United States
and the United Nations, Washington must grant visas to diplomats on
U.N. business and let them operate missions in New York.
   The State Department has denied visas to suspected spies and
propagandists seeking U.N. credentials as diplomats and journalists.
   Reagan hardened the U.S. stance in the 1980s, not only refusing
them credentials to work in the U.N. but preventing them from
visiting U.N. headquarters to speak.
   The United States blocked Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
from addressing the United Nations in 1983 after the Soviet Union
downed Korean Airlines Flight 007, in which 269 people died.
   New York and New Jersey refused to allow Gromyko's plane to land
at their commercial airports.
   Soviet diplomats and the United Nations defended Gromyko's right
to speak, but Gromyko canceled his visit.
   On Saturday, the State Department denied a visa to Yasser Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, saying he
condoned terrorist attacks.
   U.N. legal counsel Carl-August Fleischhauer said Monday that
decision violates the Headquarters Agreement.
   Fleischhauer said that in the past, the United Nations did not
take a position on rejected visa requests ``where the requesting
state itself, for reasons of its own, did not pursue the matter.''
   During the Cold War years, the U.S. regularly rejected visa
applications of suspected spies from the Soviet bloc, and the
requests were withdrawn.
   An Iranian who had been convicted of an attempt to assassinate
the Shah of Iran was denied an entry visa in 1954.
   In 1981, the State Department refused a visa for an Iranian
deputy foreign minister who it said was involved in the 1979
takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The request was withdrawn.
   Earlier this year, most U.N. nations accused the United States of
violating the Headquarters Agreement by attempting to evict the
PLO's U.N. mission in Manhattan.
   In June, a judge ruled against the Justice Department's effort.

   Investigators suspect someone
deliberately set fires that caused construction trailers loaded with
45,000 pounds of a chemical used in dynamite to explode Tuesday,
killing six firefighters, police said.
   Detectives investigating the deaths as possible homicides
questioned four people Tuesday night to ``evaluate their alibis,''
said Sgt. Gregory Mills, a police spokesman. There were no arrests,
he said.
   The explosions ripped large craters in the ground and shattered
windows up to 10 miles away.
   The first trailer was filled with an estimated 30,000 pounds of
ammonium nitrate, which is used to make dynamite explode more
evenly, authorities said. The second trailer was storing about
15,000 pounds of the material. A third explosion occurred moments
later in what was believed to be a portion of the first trailer that
had been blown apart.
   ``It's the worst thing I've ever seen,'' said Battalion Chief
Marion Germann.
   Debris was scattered over several acres around the construction
site in south Kansas City and onto nearby U.S. 71, said police
spokesman Sgt. Greg Mills.
   The blasts left two very large craters, 30 to 40 feet wide and 6
or 7 feet deep, and a smaller one about 15 feet across and 4 feet
deep.
   ``The remains of one fire truck is sitting very close to one
crater,'' said Fire Department spokesman Harold Knabe. ``There is
another vehicle of some sort, a large red truck. The other fire
truck _ there is absolutely no evidence that it was ever there.''
   Windows, some of them large plate-glass panels, were broken in
scores of businesses and homes. One merchant, Stan Katz, said
looters took items from his Food City Warehouse supermarket, where
several large windows were shattered.
   A woman at a motel about three-quarters of a mile away said the
force knocked her from her bed to the floor.
   Firefighters were already at the construction site when the
explosions rocked the area about 4 a.m. Two security guards at the
site had called them when they noticed a pickup truck on fire, Knabe
said.
   Investigators said they suspected the fires were arson, but had
no clear motive. They said the fires did not appear to be
professionally set.
   Labor union officials and contractors said there had been no
problems at the site, where demolition is occurring to clear a path
for a highway.
   Security guards reported seeing someone and went to investigate,
Knabe said. When they returned, they found one of their pickup
trucks burning, and called firemen.
   Three firefighters arrived with a pumper truck at 3:45 a.m. Knabe
said they noticed another fire in the construction trailer and
called for more help.
   By the time the second pumper with three more firefighters
arrived, the pickup fire was out and both trucks went to the other
fire.
   Germann was about to order the firefighters to pull back when the
first blast occurred, Mills said.
   ``He saw a strange burning pattern,'' said Mills. ``He was just
in the process of ordering his firefighters out when the explosion
hit.''
   Germann estimated the firefighters wer about 30 to 40 feet from
the burning trailer.
   The explosions occurred at a construction site on the southern
edge of Kansas City, about 1{ miles northwest of Bannister Mall, one
of the area's busiest shopping malls. Several quarries are located
adjacent to the highway construction site.
   Construction workers had been blasting in the area to clear rocks
for a freeway project.
   The dead firefighters were identified as Capt. Gerald C.
Halloran, 57; Capt. James Kilventon Jr., 54; firefighters Thomas M.
Fry, 41, Luther E. Hurd, 31, and Michael R. Oldham, 32; and Robert
D. McKarnin, 42, a fire apparatus operator.
   The accident was the worst in the fire department's history. Five
firefighters were killed in a 1959 gasoline storage tank explosion.

<HEAD>NBC Sweeps Sweep</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the 1988 November sweep results enter the
record books, there will be a big asterisk next to them because of
the writers' strike that delayed the TV season.
   But the month will most likely be remembered for the last of the
big-event network miniseries.
   According to the A.C. Nielsen Co., with a couple of days left,
NBC had won the November sweeps by about 2 rating points, despite
ABC's ``War and Remembrance,'' an 18-hour megaseries that ended up a
rating of 18.6 and a share of 29.
   Each rating point equals 904,000 households with television. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   Even the competing networks expected the ``Winds of War'' sequel
to do somewhere in the mid-30 shares. ABC reportedly guaranteed
advertisers a 20.2 rating and will have to give them free commercial
time to make up the difference. ABC executives had predicted they'd
lose $20 million on the miniseries even if it met the guarantees.
   The poor performance of the first 18 hours of ``War and
Remembrance'' casts doubt on whether the remaining 12-14 hours will
run next May as tentatively planned. It also once again casts doubt
upon the value to networks of such big-budget, time-consuming
programs.
   ABC, meanwhile, will offer the first 18 hours on videocassette
next week.
   As of the end of prime time Sunday, NBC had 2-point lead on ABC
for the sweeps win. November is one of four months a year when
network affiliates' local ratings are measured for purposes of
negotiating advertising rates. The networks usually load up their
schedules with special programming to help affiliates. This
November, however, the first sweeps period of the new season was
dampened by delays caused by the writers' strike. ABC and CBS still
have regular series that have yet to premiere this season, and ABC
rushed ``War and Remembrance'' onto the air to fill gaps.
   NBC won the week that ended Sunday with an average, prime-time
rating of 15.0. ABC had 13.0 and CBS 12.0.
   The week included Thanksgiving on Thursday, NBC's biggest night
for ratings. As a result, ``The Cosby Show'' barely made the top 10.
But two NBC movies, ``In the Line of Duty: The FBI Murders'' and
``Take My Daughters, Please,'' made the top 10.
   An atypical week in news _ due to football pre-emptions _ gave
NBC its first victory in the news race since Sept. 14, 1987. ``NBC
Nightly News'' had a rating of 10.5 and a 20 share. The ``CBS
Evening News'' had a 10.2 and 20, and ``ABC World News Tonight'' had
a 10.0 and 20.
   The top-rated prime-time shows last week were: ``Golden Girls,''
NBC; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS; ``In the Line of Duty: The FBI Murders,''
NBC; ``Empty Nest,'' NBC; ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS tied with
``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``Take My Daughters, Please,'' NBC; ``Who's the
Boss?'' ABC; ``ALF,'' NBC; ``Amen'' tied ``The Cosby Show,'' both
NBC.
   The next-to-the-last installment of ``War and Remembrance''
ranked 12th. The final installment was ranked 16th.
   The only new series last week was CBS' critically praised
``Almost Grown,'' which had a two-hour movie preview on Sunday and
came in 30th. It moved to its regular time period on Monday.
   Fox's ``Married With Children'' had its highest rating and share
ever, a 10.5 and 15, better than 14 network shows.

   A judge Tuesday turned aside a challenge to Boston
University's proposal to take over Chelsea's troubled public
schools, ruling against teachers concerned that local officials were
abdicating their responsibilities.
   Suffolk Superior Court Judge Walter Steele without comment denied
the Massachusetts Federation of Teachers' request for an injunction
blocking any agreement between the university and the school
district, which has 3,300 students.
   Later Tuesday, the Chelsea School Committee voted 5-2 to
tentatively agree to accept a contract with the university.
   ``They (university officials) have to be given a chance,'' said
Morris Seigal, a committee member who voted in favor of the
contract. ``We do not have any other alternative.''
   The contract could be made final in two weeks, university
officials said.
   Union lawyer Bruce Miller said he was disappointed by the judge's
ruling and predicted it would not be the last legal battle.
   ``Rather than dealing with the question of education, we're going
to be dealing with the question of litigation,'' he said.
   In what would be a groundbreaking arrangement, the private
university is proposing to run the public school district for 10
years. Chelsea, a town of 26,000 just north of Boston, has the
lowest per-capita income and the highest school dropout rate in the
state.
   University educators are proposing to revamp the curriculum,
supervise the building of new schools and create special programs
such as counseling for pregnant teen-agers.
   Chelsea School Committee Chairman Bruce Robinson said Chelsea's
deteriorating finances make the proposal a necessity. ``It's an
ambitious plan,'' he said. ``We're going to have to give BU some
slack.''
   The union had argued that the proposal should be stopped, saying
state law forbids putting a tax-funded institution into private
hands. Miller said allowing school officials to sign a contract with
the university while the constitutional issue is debated would give
BU a strong foothold in the school system.
   But Walter Greenspan, representing school officials, said it was
not possible for a judge to rule on the legality of the proposed
agreement until it had been signed.
   After the judge's ruling but before the School Committee meeting,
member Liz McBride argued against an immediate vote on the proposed
agreement. She said negotiations with the university are not
finished and describing BU's offer of help as ``fine if they want to
come in as a partnership but not as a dictatorship.''
   Committee member Lydia Walata said she didn't believe a consensus
existed on the issue since some members were unhappy at the way BU
has made its proposals.
   ``It's sort of like a bull in a china shop,'' she said.

   A 6-foot steel rod that impaled a
construction worker after a three-story fall may prevented him from
plunging six more floors to a certain death, doctors said.
   The bar, which measured 1.8 inches, pierced Jakie Dale Klaber's
belly and groin Monday, but it probably kept him from plummeting to
the ground outside a parking garage, said Drs. Tom Harris and Brian
Zachariah.
   ``The rod basically arrested his fall,'' said Harris, a
third-year resident in emergency medicine, who treated Klaber at the
scene.
   Zachariah, another third-year resident, said that without the
rod, the 50- year-old crane operator would definitely have died in
the accident at the Whittenberg Engineering and Construction Co.
site.
   Klaber was reported in serious condition after the rod was
removed during an operation at Humana Hospital-University of
Louisville, officials said.
   Klaber was hoisting a half-ton wooden concrete-form panel from
inside a control cab on top of the nine-story garage when a gust
apparently blew the 8-by-12-foot panel into the wooden cab, knocking
it and Klaber over the building's edge, according to witnesses and a
Whittenberg vice president.
   Klaber, still inside the control cab, fell headfirst 36 feet to
the sixth-floor parking deck, which juts out farther than the top
three floors. He fell almost vertically onto the steel rod, located
within 2 feet of the garage's edge.
   Firefighters rescuing Klaber cut through the bar with a torch
and, with the rod still imbedded in his body, lowered Klaber to the
ground in a basket.

   Police used a battering ram to break through the
fortresslike doors of a Chicago gang's headquarters, seized four
guns and 69 grams of cocaine and arrested a man wanted on a murder
warrant.
   The police raid Monday was sparked by a manhunt for Anthony Fort,
22, the eldest son of imprisoned El Rukn founder and leader Jeff
Fort.
   Anthony Fort, wanted on a murder warrant, was taken into custody
later that day, but police Tuesday found his alibi was legitimate
and he was not charged with the Thanksgiving death of a woman, Lt.
Philip Cline said.
   Cline said Fort, however, also was carrying a gun illegally at
the time of his arrest and was named in several bond forfeiture
warrants, so other charges are pending.
   The headquarters, known as the El Rukn Grand Major Mosque, was
raided by police and Chicago Fire Department personnel who tore
apart walls and flooring in a search for weapons, ammunition and
drugs.
   Investigators found the guns, drugs and three or four gallons of
a codeine-based medication, commonly known on the street as
``syrup,'' police Captain Frank Radke said Tuesday.
   ``We confiscated all their records also,'' Radke said.
   Reputed El Rukn members Arthur Proctor, 47, Charles Green, 46,
and Duane Price, 30, were arrested and charged with weapons
violations and illegal possession of narcotics, police said.
   Police were followed by officials from the gas and electric
companies, who shut off the utilities for nonpayment of bills,
police said. The water was also shut off to the building, which once
was a South Side movie palace.
   Anthony Fort is wanted in the slaying of Katie Vines, 27, who was
shot in the head early Thanksgiving Day, police said.
   Two reputed El Rukn members, Christopher Brooks, 22, and Darryl
Howard, 26, were arrested Thursday in the woman's slaying and
charged with armed robbery and murder.
   The El Rukns, formerly known as the Blackstone Rangers and the
Black P Stone Nation, maintain they are a Moslem religious group and
that the raided building is a mosque.

   South Africa is sending tons of
nonlethal aid to Mozambique to protect and help repair a
hydroelectric project damaged by rebels who have received covert
military support from Pretoria.
   The supply ship Drakensberg unloaded 139 tons of equipment
Monday, including tents, radios, underwear and 21 trucks. Two more
voyages are to bring the total deliveries by early 1989 to $4
million.
   South African officials said it was the first visit by one of
their navy vessels to Mozambique in its 13 years of independence.
They said the aid represented one of the largest foreign grants ever
made by South Africa.
   The equipment is for a Mozambican military force to be formed to
protect the 560 miles of power lines from the Cahora Bassa dam on
the Zambezi River in western Mozambique to the South Africa border.
Work on nearly 600 electrical pylons damaged by Mozambican rebels is
to begin in four months and take 18 months to complete.
   Mozambican Energy Minister Antonio Branco declared at a dockside
ceremony that restoration of Cahora Bassa could contribute to ``a
climate of stability and development'' in southern Africa.
   He refused to discuss Mozambican allegations that some South
African aid still reaches Mozambique guerrillas. Mozambican
officials believe that mutual undertakings like the Cahora Bassa
agreement will pressure sections of the South African military
suspected of supplying arms to the rebels.
   Relations between the neighboring countries worsened in the early
1980s, when South African soldiers raided Mozambican targets housing
members of the African National Congress, the main guerrilla group
fighting the Pretoria government.
   At the same time, Mozambican National Resistance guerrillas,
fighting their Marxist government, covertly received South African
miltary supplies.
   The 1984 Nkomati Accord, pledging South Africa to end support for
the rebels if Mozambique expelled ANC guerrillas, faltered amid
accusations that South Africa broke the pact.
   South Africa's desire to mend fences and Mozambique's need for
economic help led the two countries to try again through new
agreements on trade, employment and technical assistance.
   Cahora Bassa, one of the world's largest hydroelectric projects,
has been severely affected by guerrilla activity since it opened 13
years ago. The dam was built by Portugal, once Mozambique's colonial
ruler.
   If it reached full operation, the dam could supply power to a
large part of southern Africa.
   South Africa, which generates 60 percent of Africa's electricity,
presently has a power surplus. But Deputy Economic Affairs Minister
George Bartlett said Cahora Bassa electricty could enable South
Africa to defer construction of costly coal-fired power stations
until the 21st century.
   He said Mozambique could receive $5.5 million a year in fees for
the electricity.

   Albert and Judy Linkenberg started with
1,200 cans of shaving cream and finished with a house filled 2 feet
deep with minty-smelling cream and $10,000.
   The Kentucky couple lathered up radio station WLRS-FM for the
five-digit shave by fulfilling the station's contest challenge _
``What would you do for $10,000?''
   A committee chose the shaving-cream idea because it created an
atmosphere that was fun but safe, said Toney Brooks, president of
Radio One, which owns WLRS.
   If the Linkenbergs were unsuccessful, the station would have let
the runner-up try his stunt _ swimming across the Ohio River with a
bottle of wine and glasses cemented to a card table on his back,
Brooks said.
   Before the Linkenbergs began their stunt Monday, the carpet and
the furniture in their two-bedroom, one-story bungalow were covered
with plastic.
   ``This was Judy's idea,'' Linkenberg declared at one point.
   The Linkenbergs, with help from friends and relatives, emptied
the last can more than five hours later.
   The Linkenbergs, though thousands of dollars richer, will have to
subtract taxes, cleanup costs and $880 for the 1,200 cans of Colgate
regular, menthol and aloe shaving cream.
   They hope to use the money to refinance their home's 30-year
mortgage or buy a car to replace their 1962 Chevy Nova.

write-in votes for president in Broward County, an election official
says.
   But the top vote-getter in write-in ballots unsealed Monday was
the more serious figure of Democrat Jesse Jackson, who got 90 votes,
said county Supervisor of Elections Jane Carroll.
   Voters also tapped Richard Nixon, Gary Hart and Oliver North for
the White House, but less serious figures dominated.
   Cartoon characters Garfield, Bullwinkle the Moose, Goofy, Bill

   However, she did say that four disgruntled voters opted for
``none of the above.''

<HEAD>Congressman's Son Swore He Was a Chicagoan While on Washington
Payroll</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the son of a Chicago congressman was
living and running for political office there, he was on the payroll
of the District of Columbia's delegate to Congress _ an arrangement
in apparent conflict with both House rules and Illinois election
laws.
   According to records of the House of Representatives, Walter E.
Fauntroy, the district's non-voting delegate to the House, hired
Thomas John Savage, the son of Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., on Sept. 8,
1987, and kept him on the payroll through June 30, 1988, except for
a six-week unpaid leave in February and March.
   Records show that, on Dec. 13, 1987, while he was an employee of
Fauntroy, Savage filed a petition with the Illinois Board of
Elections to run in the March 15, 1988, primary for state
representative. In the petition, he swore ``that I reside at 10846
South Halsted St., Chicago'' and that he was ``legally qualified to
hold such office.''
   Illinois election laws say a candidate ``for two (2) years
preceding election, must be a resident of the district he is to
represent.''
   Savage also was paid $5,600 during this period for working on his
father's re-election campaign, federal records show.
   If Savage were working in Chicago at the time he was on
Fauntroy's payroll, he would stand in apparent contradiction of
House rules.
   A House Ethics Committee guide for congressmen stipulates that
House staff assistants can be paid ``only for services performed in
Washington, D.C., or in the state or district that the member
represents.''
   In an interview, Savage denied that he held a no-show
congressional job.
   ``I was in Washington full-time, except maybe for a couple of
weekends, from September (1987) on,'' he said. ``It was impossible
that I was there (in Chicago) weekdays.''
   But a former worker in Rep. Savage's Chicago office said Thomas
Savage was doing work for his father there while he supposedly was
in Washington.
   The Illinois residency law is strictly enforced. For example, Tim
Wright, a candidate for the state legislature, was removed from the
primary ballot last spring. He owned a house in the district he
wanted to represent but had not lived in it for two full years.
   House payroll records show that except for the six-week unpaid
leave in February and March 1988, Savage was paid as a legislative
assistant to Fauntroy until June 30, 1988, earning $21,398 for the
10-month period.
   Savage said he spent most of the fall of 1987 in Washington,
lived in Chicago while on the leave, returned to Washington after
the March 15 primary and stayed here until he left Fauntroy's
payroll.
   He claimed his job was to enlist support among House members for
a Fauntroy bill that would grant statehood status to the District of
Columbia. However, he could not name any members he had lobbied.
   Fauntroy did not return a reporter's repeated phone messages left
at his office last week and Monday and Tuesday. Rep. Savage also did
not return several phone calls.
   Thomas Savage maintained that a Chicago apartment he shares with
his wife, Drella, fulfilled the state election board's residency
requirement. He said that while working in Washington, he stayed at
his father's apartment and his wife remained in Chicago.
   Among those who place the younger Savage in Chicago during the
time he was on Fauntroy's payroll is Nelson Rice, who defeated him
in the primary.
   ``He was here every damn day _ he was available, accessible,''
said Rice. ``Unless he had free airplane flights back and forth,
there was no way he could have been in Washington.''
   Juanita Bratcher, a reporter for the Chicago Daily Defender who
covered Thomas Savage's campaign, said she frequently saw him around
Chicago during the period he was on Fauntroy's congressional payroll.
   In addition, a former worker in Rep. Savage's Chicago office said
Thomas Savage made almost-daily appearances during the time he was
supposedly working in Washington.
   ``I saw him there five or six days a week during the fall,'' said
the former worker, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. ``In
December, he was there every day.''
   Campaign spending records filed by Rep. Savage with the Federal
Elections Commission say his son was owed $9,200 by the campaign,
and had received $5,600 between Sept. 4, 1987, and when he left
Fauntroy's payroll last June. The younger Savage said the money was
for work done in prior elections.
   The FEC records list only amounts paid and owed campaign workers
and do not detail when the work was performed.
   The younger Savage is also not listed in the official 1988 House
telephone directory, which includes all congressional staff
assistants. The directory is issued each March and includes anyone
on the congressional payroll at the end of the preceding year.
   Savage was hired by Fauntroy just a month after his father hired
Lezli Baskerville, a Fauntroy aide. Ms. Baskerville was given a job
with a subcommittee Rep. Savage chairs, according to House records
and committee officials.
   But Baskerville was removed from the Public Works and
Transportation Committee job after it was learned she was not
showing up for work, committee officials said.

<HEAD>New Airline Alarm Would Tell Pilot If Other Alarms Fail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concern about the reliability of the safety
alarms on commercial jetliners is responsible for the government's
suggestion for a new device in 3,700 aircraft: an alarm to warn
pilots their alarm isn't working.
   The Federal Aviation Administration announced Tuesday that it
plans to require airlines early next year to install a warning light
in all of their jetliners to tell pilots if their takeoff alarm
system is out of commission.
   The takeoff alarms, variations of which are found in all
commercial jetliners, are supposed to guard against a plane taking
off without being properly prepared, such as having its wing flaps
in the wrong position.
   The alarm, which in some planes sounds a loud horn and in others
a computerized voice, often is the last defense against a pilot's
oversight, aviation experts say.
   But in at least two recent crashes the alarms apparently didn't
work as they should have and a spot check earlier this year of
Boeing 727 aircraft found 35 cases in which the alarms either failed
or did not operate properly, according to the FAA.
   The FAA said in its proposed order Tuesday that the new warning
lights, which would light up if electrical power to the takeoff
alarm system is interrupted, must be clearly visible to everyone in
the cockpit.
   The modification, which likely would be made during a plane's
routine maintenance so as not to interrupt normal service, would
apply to aircraft manufactured by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas,
Lockheed and Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, as well as
foreign manufacturers of smaller jets such as Fokker and British
Aerospace.
   ``You're talking about the entire (U.S.) passenger fleet of large
jet airplanes,'' FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said. He estimated the
added device would cost about $1,050 per plane.
   Airlines have until February to comment on the proposal, after
which the FAA is expected to issue a mandatory requirement fairly
quickly, officials said. While the air carriers will have another
year to comply, many probably will begin immediately to make the
modification in some aircraft.
   The alarm systems have been a focus of attention in two major
airline crashes within the last 15 months.
   On Aug. 16, 1987, an alarm on a Northwest Airlines jetliner
failed to sound even though the flight crew forgot to position the
wing flaps of their McDonnell Douglas MD-80 prior to a takeoff from
Detroit's Metro International Airport. The plane crashed, killing
156 people, and investigators blamed the failure to set the flaps,
which help in gaining lift.
   Investigators also are examining the possibility of an improper
flap setting in the crash of a Delta Air Lines Boeing 727 near
Dallas last August in which 14 of the 108 people aboard were killed.
   The importance of the alarms was underscored at a hearing Tuesday
in Irving, Texas, into that crash. Officials said the wing flaps
found in the wreckage were retracted instead of extended for
takeoff, but that the alarm hadn't sounded.
   The National Transportation Safety Board determined in its
investigation of the Detroit crash that the alarm on that plane did
not sound because electrical power was interrupted. Investigators
could not determine conclusively what caused the power interruption,
the safety board said.
   At the time, however, the Air Line Pilots Association maintained
there was a possible inherent problem with the alarm systems that
made them susceptible to electrical failure.
   The NTSB said it could not determine whether the power
interruption was due to such a defect.

<HEAD>Private Shipyards Want Navy-Owned Yards Shut Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private shipyards are pushing the federal
commission studying possible military base closures to target some
of the Navy-owned shipyards that compete against them.
   John J. Stocker, the president of the Shipbuilders Council of
America, argues in a letter to the special commission that ``in
these times of severe budget constraints, the closure of non-nuclear
(government) shipyards would result in significant budget savings to
the U.S. Treasury.''
   ``The Navy commanded in 1946 a fleet of 1,115 naval ships
supported by 11 naval shipyards employing 93,600 civilian
employees,'' Stocker wrote. ``At the end of fiscal 1987, the Navy
had an active fleet of 568 ships supported by eight naval shipyards
employing 72,400 workers.''
   Stocker's letter, dated Nov. 28 and obtained Tuesday, was sent to
former Sen. Abraham A. Ribicoff, one of two men co-chairing the
Commission on Base Realignment and Closure.
   Legislation signed by President Reagan last month authorized the
12-member citizens' commission to review the nation's military bases
and to decide which are outmoded and can be closed, at a projected
annual savings of $2 billion to $5 billion.
   The panel has until Dec. 31 to report its findings to Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, who may forward the list to Congress if
he wishes. Should he decide to do so, Congress can veto the entire
list but cannot act to protect individual bases, as it often has in
the past.
   The ``all-or-nothing'' procedure is viewed as offering the best
chance in more than a decade to actually close unneeded military
bases over the objection of local congressmen.
   The Shipbuilders Council represents corporate shipyards around
the country. The private yards have seen orders for construction of
commercial ships disappear in recent years, leaving the Navy as
their main source of business.
   The Navy's yards, at the same time, have begun to modernize and
are underbidding private industry for repair and overhaul contracts.
   The private yards assert they can't compete in such bidding
contests because the government yards aren't trying to make a profit.
   The Navy's eight yards are located in Long Beach, Calif.; Puget
Sound, Wash.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Mare Island, Calif.; Pearl Harbor,
Hawaii; Charleston, S.C.; Norfolk, Va., and Portsmouth, N.H.
   Of those eight, two are not equipped to handle overhauls or
repairs to nuclear-powered ships _ Philadelphia and Long Beach _ and
they were singled out by Stocker as prime candidates for closure.
   The Navy had no immediate comment, saying it had not seen
Stocker's letter. In the past, however, it has argued the public
yards are ``uniquely critical'' because they provide basic capacity
needed in the event of a war or other emergency.
   The commission has refused to discuss its internal deliberations
or the material it receives from various organizations.

   Sen. George Mitchell, the new Senate majority
leader, first reached a national audience when he bucked a tide of
sympathy for Oliver L. North and said the Marine lieutenant colonel
had no monopoly on patriotism.
   North had stolen the televised spotlight at the 1987 Iran-Contra
hearings as he repeatedly attacked those in Congress who had
vigorously opposed the Reagan administration's policy of military
aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   He appealed for congressional aid to the Contras ``for the love
of God and the love of country.''
   Mitchell, a former federal prosecutor and district court judge,
counterattacked _ but in a characteristic calm manner.
   ``Please remember that others share that devotion and recognize
that it is possible for an American to disagree with you on aid to
the Contras and still love God and still love this country just as
much as you do,'' Mitchell told North.
   ``In America, disagreement with the policies of the government is
not evidence of lack of patriotism,'' he declared.
   For Mitchell, that moment under the crystal chandeliers of the
Senate Caucus Room represented his debut on the national scene.
   But he already was being lionized by Senate Democrats.
   As chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, Mitchell
engineered the stunning 1986 upset that saw Democrats regain the
Senate control they had lost in Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential
landslide.
   His reward: instant influence and clout on the Democratic side of
the aisle and appointment as the Senate's deputy president pro
tempore, a largely honorary post but an important mark of the high
regard of Democratic senators.
   Now, the Senate's majority Democrats have passed to Mitchell the
gavel of leadership being relinquished by Senate Majority Leader
Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., who is stepping down to become chairman of
the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   Twenty seven Democrats voted for Mitchell on the first ballot in
the party's caucus Tuesday. Twenty eight others split evenly between
Sens. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, and J. Bennett Johnston, D-La.
Mitchell was then elected by acclamation.
   Mitchell's elevation to the Senate's top leadership post gives
him control of the chamber's agenda as the 101st Congress begins its
work and as President-elect George Bush launches his administration
and announces his policy and legislative goals.
   It marks a new beginning after Byrd's long tenure as party
leader. Many Senate Democrats hope Mitchell can use it to project a
positive, forward-looking image for their party in the wake of its
three successive defeats in for the presidency. He has vowed to
share his authority with colleagues, saying, ``I do not intend to be
a one-man band.''
   Mitchell, 55, has been active in Maine's Democratic politics
since 1968, and is a protege of Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine, whom
he served as administrative assistant in the early 1960s.
   Mitchell suffered a number of political setbacks, including
defeat in a bid for governor in 1974. But with Muskie's backing, he
was appointed first as U.S. attorney for Maine, then as a federal
district judge.
   When Muskie resigned from the Senate in May 1980 to become
secretary of state under former President Carter, he recommended
Maine's Democratic governor appoint Mitchell to fill the vacancy.
   Two years later, Mitchell won the seat in his own right by a
commanding 61 percent of the vote. He won a second term this year by
an even more impressive 81 percent.
   In the Senate, Mitchell compiled a largely liberal voting record
and became a leading critic of the Reagan administration's
environmental record.
   At the Iran-Contra hearings, he compared North's glittering
Marine Corps record in Vietnam and the patriotism of the immigrants
on whom he had conferred citizenship as a judge.
   ``My mother was an immigrant, my father the orphaned son of
immigrants,'' he said. ``Their opportunities were very limited
because neither of them had any education. ... They worked at very
menial tasks in our society.''
   And he told North that when he asked new immigrants why they
wished to live in the United States, many of them said the reason
was that ``in America you can criticize the government without
looking over your shoulder.''
   Mitchell's father was a utility company laborer who later worked
as a janitor. His mother, an immigrant from Lebanon, worked at a
woolen mill in Waterville, Maine, where the family lived.
   Their son graduated from Maine's Bowdoin College in 1954 and from
Georgetown University law school in 1960.

   More than 1.2 million undocumented farm workers
are expected to have applied for amnesty to live legally in the
United States under a program that ends midnight tonight.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service had estimated that
more than 1 million people had applied for resident alien status
under the program by late November and as many as 200,000 more might
apply before tonight's deadline.
   Legalization offices will stay open until the deadline to allow
last-minute filing, the INS said in a statement.
   Aliens who can prove that they worked for at least 90 days in
agricultural field work between May 1, 1985, and May 1, 1986, are
eligible to apply, the INS said. People whose applications are
turned down cannot be deported on the basis of their applications.

<HEAD>Analysts Foresee Higher U.S. Farm Exports Although Volumes Decline</HEAD>

   Bolstered by higher world prices, U.S. farm
exports are expected to continue to grow in value in 1989, rising
about $1 billion to $36.5 billion, according to the latest
Agriculture Department projections.
   However, export volumes are forecast to shrink by 8 percent in
fiscal year 1989 in response to declines for some farm products hard
hit by last summer's drought.
   The projected increase in export values would mark the third
straight year of growth. American farm exports rose from $26.3
billion in fiscal year 1986 to $27.9 billion in 1987 to $35.5
billion in 1988.
   The volume of sales probably will fall to 136 million metric tons
in 1989, down from a six-year high of nearly 148 million metric tons
in the year ended Sept. 30, according to Richard W. Goldberg, acting
undersecretary of agriculture for international affairs and
commodity programs.
   Goldberg delivered what he described as a ``bright'' agricultural
trade forecast at Tuesday's opening session of USDA's Agricultural
Outlook Conference, an annual event in which government analysts
outline prospects for the coming year for farmers and agribusiness.
   ``Export volume is forecast smaller as the U.S. share of world
trade shrinks for drought-affected products,'' Goldberg said.
   Overall, the United States is expected to account for 48 percent
of world total grain trade in 1989, down from 50 percent.
   One of the hardest hit commodities is soybeans, with the U.S.
share of world soybean trade forecast to drop to 35 percent in 1989
from 49 percent.
   Rice, corn and horticultural products are among the few
commodities expected to see increases in 1989 export volumes, with
wheat and wheat flour falling about 2 percent to 40.2 million metric
tons.
   But with global grain stocks drawn down largely because of the
drought in North America, Goldberg said that world prices for wheat,
corn and soybeans should be their highest since 1985.
   Goldberg said a $2.6 billion increase in the value of U.S. grain
and feed exports will offset declines for cotton and oilseeds in
1989.
   ``For U.S. agriculture, the challenge in the coming year will be
to sustain the momentum in overseas sales which has been regained
over the past few years,'' said Goldberg. ``This will require more
competitive prices, aggressive market development, persistent trade
policy efforts and a market-oriented trade philosophy.''
   Imports of agricultural products into the United States are
expected to remain about the same as 1988's record $21 billion. That
means that the U.S. agricultural trade surplus should rise about $1
billion in 1989, reaching about $15.5 billion. In contrast, the
surplus stood at only $5.4 billion in 1985.
   Goldberg said projected production increases in 1989 probably
will not prevent further drains on global farm product stocks and he
pointed out that the European Community is offering ``a tremendous
incentive'' to its farmers to produce through its system of export
subsidies.
   ``The United States will have a problem competing with such
subsidized competition unless we have the supply to be competitive.
If U.S. prices aren't competitive, other nations _ especially the
subsidizing ones _ will expand their production to fill the gap,''
said Goldberg.
   He forecast that Japan and South Korea would continue to buy more
U.S. farm products in 1989 and that sales to Taiwan would remain
about the same as record amounts this year.
   Goldberg projected ``continued large imports'' of U.S. corn and
oilseeds by the Soviet Union in 1989 but said that wheat sales
probably would not match 1988's record 9 million tons. He said a
drop in crop production in China should ``strengthen the demand for
food grain exports'' and that higher wheat prices could push the
value of wheat sales to more than $800 million in 1989.

   Farmers and agribusiness should expect to see
continued growth in the U.S. economy in the year ahead, with a
potential for falling inflation, according to a member of the board
of governors of the Federal Reserve System.
   Wayne Angell, an economist and partner in a Kansas farm before
joining the Federal Reserve in 1986, said Tuesday he was
``relatively optimistic about the prospects for the economy.''
   In remarks to the USDA's Agricultural Outlook Conference, Angell
said ``a reasonable goal over the medium term would be to reduce
inflation by about one-half to 1 percentage point a year and I
believe this can be done while unemployment remains in the 5 to 6
percent range.''
   Among the biggest questions about the economic future are the
chances for reducing the U.S. trade and budget deficits, but Angell
said he didn't think the imbalances would ``derail'' the current
six-year economic expansion.

   A Soviet space official says Moscow may push
back the planned launch date of an unmanned mission to Mars to
incorporate improved technology in both the spacecraft and the
robotic rover that will retrieve samples of the red planet.
   Genrich A. Avanesov of the Space Research Institute of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, told a space conference Tuesday that it may be
in the Soviets' interest to put off the planned 1994 mission for
about two years.
   ``Technically we do have the possibility to send a mission by
1994 with a Martian rover, but we're not sure it's worth doing,''
Avanesov said after a presentation to the conference on space
automation and robotics. ``It may be worth doing a more intellectual
mission later.''
   Asked whether funding for the mission was a problem, he said:
``Money is a problem today for us, too.''
   Avanesov emphasized that no official decision has been made on
the timing of the mission.
   Rescheduling the mission would enable the Soviets to use findings
of a U.S. mission to Mars that is planned for 1993. On that mission,
an unmanned probe called the Mars Observer is to take photographs of
Mars' surface while orbiting the planet for about two years.
   The Soviet mission will send a robotic rover to explore the red
planet's surface and return samples of its soil and atmosphere to
Earth.
   Experts in both countries have agreed that unmanned missions to
probe the surface of Mars will be necessary before a manned mission
can be launched, but it will take several years to develop the
necessary automation and robotics.
   ``No research breakthroughs seem to be required, but a great deal
of applied research and technology development and demonstration
will be needed,'' Lew Allen, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, said in a paper presented to the conference.
   A Martian rover will need to be able to avoid hazards on the
planet's surface when it lands, negotiate the terrain, preserve soil
and atmospheric samples, and rendezvous with its launcher, he said.
   ``We see that the rover should be an intellectual one,'' with
sophisticated automation, Avanesov said. ``The question of the
autonomy is a very serious one ... and should be specially
considered.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is considering
a second unmanned mission to the planet to follow the Mars Observer,
Aaron Cohen, director of NASA's Johnson Space Center, told the
conference.
   He said a mission could be launched in 1998 to land a robotic
rover on the surface of Mars, gather samples of soil, rock and
atmosphere, and return the samples to Earth in 2001.
   ``The delivery and return phases ... offer many technical and
engineering challenges,'' he said. ``It taxes our automation
capabilities.''
   Soviet plans to explore Mars, culminating with a manned mission
around 2010 to 2015, are the top priority of Moscow's space program,
Avanesov said, adding: ``We think this Mars project will give us
broad opportunity for international cooperation.''
   His paper to the conference said the United States and Soviet
Union could work together on certain aspects of a Mars program,
including organization of a joint ground-based network of data
reception, joint data interpretation, creation of a joint data bank
on the Martian atmosphere and other exchanges of information.
   Soviet and NASA officials have met twice this year in Washington
to exchange information. They also are making plans to fly American
instruments on future Soviet missions and Soviet instruments on
future U.S. flights.

<HEAD>Analysts Forecast Strong World Wheat Market in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government and private analysts said today the
outlook for world wheat markets looks strong next year and offers
U.S. producers a good opportunity to make gains.
   More land worldwide is expected to be devoted to wheat production
in 1989 because of strong crop prices and government incentives,
including easing of land-idling restrictions for farmers in the
United States, said Bruce R. Weber, an economist with the
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   In prepared remarks for delivery at today's session of the USDA
Agricultural Outlook Conference, Weber forecast that total harvested
areas for wheat could rise 5 percent to 6 percent above 1988 levels
to 230 million to 232 million hectares worldwide. A hectare is a
metric measure equalling nearly 2{ acres.
   ``If the recent upward trend in yields continue, the world should
easily harvest a 1989 wheat crop in excess of 500 million (metric)
tons,'' said Weber. ``How favorable the growing season is will
dictate how close the crop comes to the record 530 million harvest
of 1986.''
   Weber noted that recent wheat use globally has exceeded 530
million metric tons, which has caused stocks worldwide to decline.
Because production is likely to fall below wheat utilization, Weber
said ``this sets the stage for another strong year for world wheat
trade.''
   USDA's World Agricultural Outlook Board projects that U.S. wheat
and flour exports will decline in volume in fiscal year 1989 to 40.2
million metric tons from 41.5 million but the value will rise to
$5.9 billion from $4.6 billion in 1988. A metric ton is 1.1 tons.
   Richard Gady, vice president of economic research for ConAgra
Inc., recommended that the government respond to world wheat demand
by lowering from 10 percent to 5 percent the acreage reduction
requirements for U.S. farmers to participate in the wheat program in
1989. That would permit expanded U.S. production.
   He also urged aggressive use of the Export Enhancement Program,
under which the government subsidizes grain sales to offset
competition from the European Community and other suppliers.
   ``It appears that the wheat market is in a cyclically stronger
period as world surpluses have been reduced and the demand
environment is improved,'' said Gady. ``This should provide U.S.
producers an opportunity to put productive acres back to work and
expect a reasonable return.''
   U.S. corn plantings in 1989 could rise by 8 million to 10 million
acres because of government program changes and next year's crop
could fall between 7.7 billion to 8.3 billion bushels, according to
David B. Hull, an ASCS economist. This year's crop was 4.67 billion
bushels, down 34 percent because of the drought.
   Hull said he expected barley and oat crops to increase more than
75 percent next year and be about double 1988 amounts. Grain sorghum
production should return to normal next year, he said. This year's
grain sorghum crop was 546 million bushels, down about 26 percent
from 1987.

   One Navy serviceman was killed and another was
seriously injured on the USS Nimitz in the north Arabian Sea early
Wednesday when a fire apparently was started by an accidental firing
of an aircraft gun, a Defense Department spokesman said.
   Six aircraft on the nuclear-powered carrier were damaged by the
blaze, said Army Maj. John Smith. The incident occurred at 2:48 a.m.
(7:48 p.m. Tuesday EST).
   The identities of the two men were not immediately released
pending notification of next of kin, Smith said.
   The fire apparently started when a gun on an A-7E aircraft
accidentally fired during routine maintenance, Smith said. The round
of ammunition struck an A-6 aircraft, which ignited, and the blaze
spread to other nearby planes, he said.
   Smith said it was not immediately known whether the death and
injury were caused by the gunshot or by the blaze, which was brought
under control within 20 minutes.
   The spokesman said he did not know how badly the planes were
damaged. An investigation into the incident has begun, he said.
   The 95,000-ton carrier, based at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard
in Bremerton, Wash., is the flagship of a carrier battle group in
the Indian Ocean operating area. Smith said the carrier would
continue on its current mission.
   The 1,092-foot-long carrier normally carries a crew of more than
6,000 and more than 80 aircraft, according to the Navy.
   Named for Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, commander of the U.S.
Pacific fleet during World War II, the USS Nimitz was commissioned
in 1975.
   On Aug. 19, 1981, Nimitz jets downed two Libyan jet fighters
following an attack on Nimitz aircraft in the Gulf of Sidra.
   The Nimitz is to be based at Puget Sound until facilities can be
completed for a planned permanent homeport in Everett, Wash., north
of Seattle.

<HEAD>No Evidence That Wing Ice Was Factor in B-1B Crash, Pentagon Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has dismissed ice buildup on the
wings as the cause of a crash Nov. 17 of a B-1B bomber in South
Dakota, and says there is no need to consider adding wing de-icing
equipment to the long-range aircraft.
   ``We do not have any evidence that icing was a contributor to the
B-1B crash at Ellsworth (Air Force Base),'' Pentagon spokesman Fred
Hoffman said, downplaying a published report last week in the
Chicago Tribune.
   The report said the B-1B ``may have been downed by excessive ice
on its wings.''
   Pentagon officials, speaking on condition they not be named, told
The Associated Press on Tuesday that the ice detection system on the
plane did not indicate the bomber had experienced a dangerous
build-up of ice.
   ``There was some icing,'' one source said. ``There was ice on the
wings of another B-1B that landed just before this one. But it
wasn't a problem.''
   ``Wing icing was not considered a potential problem when
designing the aircraft and there never has been any operational
evidence that wing icing is a problem,'' Hoffman added.
   ``We have no plans to study the addition of de-icing equipment,''
added Lt. Col. Rick Oborn, an Air Force officer and Pentagon
spokesman. ``That hasn't even been considered.''
   The $280 million B-1B, like many types of military aircraft, does
not have any built-in de-icing equipment for its wings. It does,
however, carry an anti-icing system for its four engines and an ice
detection system for the wings.
   Capt. Jay DeFrank, an Air Force spokesman, said the rationale for
leaving de-icing equipment off the B-1B was simple.
   ``The B-1B can fly at such high speeds at low altitude that it
normally melts what would buildup on (the wings,)'' he said.
   ``And if you know you're facing icing conditions, you normally
fly to another base or move to a different altitude. The plane has
an ice detection system for the wings.''
   The B-1B that crashed Nov. 17 was practicing instrument landing
approaches. It was attempting to land shortly after another B-1B
made a successful approach and for reasons unknown, came in too low
and clipped a utility pole and power lines.
   The four crewmen survived after ejecting from the plane.
   In a related development, Hoffman said the Air Force would look
into allegations by some Rockwell International Corp. employees that
flawed parts might have been used in building the B-1B bombers.
   ``But the Air Force does not have any evidence at this time which
corroborates the assertions by former Rockwell employees that
substandard parts were used in the construction of B-1s,'' Hoffman
said.
   ``However, the Air Force is investigating or is looking into
these allegations.''
   A copyright report Monday by WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio, quoted
workers as saying substandard parts disappeared after being rejected
by plant inspectors. The employees said they believe those parts
subsequently were used in building the bombers to meet production
schedules.

<HEAD>Production Delayed Again At Nuclear Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department says it must push back
the restart of its K reactor at the Savannah River plant to next
spring or summer because of safety concerns, delaying production of
a critical component of nuclear weapons.
   The three reactors at Savannah River are the only operational
facilities in the United States capable of producing two critical
nuclear weapons materials, tritium and plutonium.
   None of the three reactors at Savannah River has produced weapons
material since last April.
   But just last month, Energy Department officials said the plant
would begin a phased restart of the K reactor in December and could
resume production of tritium in January.
   Tritium decays at the rate of 5.5 percent per year and
administration and congressional sources say stockpiles will be
depleted badly within six months to two years, although the exact
numbers are classified. Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen,
is used to boost the yield of nuclear weapons.
   Energy Secretary John S. Herrington has told Congress that the
United States is ``awash'' in plutonium. When asked by The
Associated Press when tritium would be in critical short supply,
Herrington said, ``I think we are OK with spring and summer,'' but
he declined to give an exact date.
   ``We are hoping to start (the K reactor) in the spring, summer,''
Herrington said. ``We are not going to start up or operate a reactor
that we are not satisfied is totally safe.''
   Since October, engineers with the Energy Department and the
operating contractor, the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., have been
developing much more stringent operating and safety criteria.
   ``We're not slipping. We are using more caution, OK?'' Herrington
said. ``I am satisfied with the progress. I think our start-up
criteria, our modifications and our upgrade are proceeding well. I
do not want to put a predicted date on the start-up.''

<HEAD>KKK Murder Spawns Supreme Court Argument About Racial Makeup Of
Juries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARRY MITCHELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A racist murder that led to a $7 million
civil verdict against the nation's oldest Ku Klux Klan group is
moving to the U.S. Supreme Court for a decision on whether defense
lawyers can bar blacks from juries.
   Defense lawyers say they doubt the high court will review whether
they can challenge every prospective black juror in order to put
together an all-white panel for Klan defendants.
   But prosecutors in Alabama, joined by other states, contend the
issue needs to be reviewed to prevent racial discrimination and give
prosecutors equal standing with defense lawyers when picking a jury
in a racially oriented case.
   ``The argument is not whether you have an all-white jury. The
argument is whether you can strike anybody because of race,'' said
University of Virginia law associate professor Pamela Karlan.
   A recent Supreme Court ruling barred prosecutors from such
racially tainted jury selection tactics. The question the court
might face if it decides to hear the case is whether the ruling can
be extended to apply to the defense. A deadline for briefs was set
for today.
   Defense attorneys are allowed to use any means within the law to
get their clients off and this has included striking potential
jurors whom they believe would be prejudiced against their clients.
   The case in question began March 21, 1981, when Michael Donald, a
19-year-old black Mobile man, was abducted at random from a city
street, beaten to death and his body hanged in a tree. KKK members
Henry Francis Hays and James ``Tiger'' Knowles were arrested in
connection with the slaying.
   Hays was convicted of capital murder and received the death
penalty. Knowles pleaded guilty to a federal charge of violating
Donald's civil rights and received a life prison sentence.
   Last year, Donald's mother, Beulah Mae Donald, won a $7 million
lawsuit against the United Klans of America, resulting in her
acquisition of the KKK headquarters building in Tuscaloosa. She sold
the building to a stockbroker. Mrs. Donald, 67, died earlier this
year.
   Mobile County prosecutors also filed murder charges against Hays'
father, Bennie Jack Hays, and the younger Hays' brother-in-law,
Frank Cox. During trial last February, the elder Hays collapsed in
court, prompting a mistrial.
   But before the two can be retried, attorneys want the high court
to answer the question about jury composition: Can defense attorneys
use peremptory challenges to strike all blacks from a jury simply
because of their race?
   The court has not yet decided whether to hear the question, which
has roused the interest of at least 40 prosecutors nationwide,
Mobile County District Attorney Chris N. Galanos said in an
interview Wednesday.
   In New York, a spokeswoman for Brooklyn District Attorney
Elizabeth Holtzman said she filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the
case Monday night. Holtzman argues that prosecutors and defense
attorneys should be on equal footing in eliminating jurors, said the
spokeswoman, Nancy Young.
   Galanos said he attempted in pretrial proceedings, without
success, to block defense attorneys from using peremptory challenges
to exclude blacks from the jury solely because of their race.
   In the end, the jury in the Cox-Hays trial had only one black,
who became an alternate juror before the mistrial.
   Galanos said the chance for a Supreme Court review could have
been enhanced if Alabama appeals courts had issued opinions in the
case instead of no-comment denials.
   Cox's attorney, Neil Hanley, said Tuesday he had filed a one-page
brief in the case, standing firm on legal precedent. He cited the
case two years ago, known as Batson vs. Kentucky, in which the
Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that the prosecution in a criminal trial of
a black defendant could not use peremptory challenges to strike all
blacks in the jury pool.
   ``The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment applies to
states and prohibits governmental discrimination. That's it,''
Hanley said.
   Hanley doesn't expect the high court to hear oral arguments on
the jury composition question ``but you never know.''
   Karlan, who has followed the Batson case, said the high court
probably would let the argument ``percolate'' in the lower courts
awhile longer. She said the high court specifically left the
question open in Batson.
   The state of Alabama has asked the high court to extend the
Batson decision to defense counsel because racial discrimination in
jury selection _ whatever its source _ ``violates the constitutional
rights of the excluded jurors, harms every member of their race,
prejudices the administration of justice and damages society as a
whole,'' she said.

   The president and his wife Nancy were honored Tuesday evening at
an elaborate dinner in the Great Hall of the Library of Congress,
attended by President-elect George Bush, his vice president-elect
Dan Quayle, and GOP senators and their spouses.
   ``Soon you will leave and we will remain behind,'' said Sen. Bob
Dole, R-Kan. ``We stay on to do the nation's work and also to
protect your legacy, and extend it to the future.''
   The Senate minority leader had effusive praise for the
president's eight years in office _ including the first four when
the GOP ran his chamber.
   ``We will always be ready to win one for the Gipper _ and we know
... there will be times when we will have to call on you to win one
more for us,'' Dole said. ``And when we do, you will ride down out
of the hills again, larger than life, ready to save the day one more
time.''
   Reagan, in his remarks, voiced regret that the Republican Party
was unable to regain control of the Senate in the past election.
   But he asked the GOP members on Tuesday to give Bush ``the same
friendship, support and solidarity that you gave me.''
   After the dinner, Reagan was presented with a gift from the
senators _ a large ``weed whacker'' for his Santa Barbara ranch.
   ``It's a high-tech, top secret device that can be used to clear
out weeds, brush, trees, rattlesnakes, desperadoes and Democrats,''
said Dole, who presented the device to Reagan.
   The president also lavished praise on Dole, Bush's one-time
political adversary, calling him a great leader who ``has never let
me down.''

   A family's cat was put into the bag near the
top of a 100-foot-high tree to end a five-day ordeal during which a
would-be rescuer landed in jail on disorderly conduct charges.
   John Wilson, stepfather of the cat's owner, climbed the pine tree
Tuesday, captured the animal and put it in a duffle bag. The cat, a
2-year-old white Persian named Spooky, was home in good condition
Tuesday night, though a little thinner, Tuesday night.
   ``He wasn't walking too straight, but he dashed straight for the
kitchen to get something to eat,'' Wilson said.
   Wilson's 25-year-old stepson, James M. Otts, was arrested Monday
night after he climbed 90 feet up the tree in an unsuccessful rescue.
   Family members said police and fire officials had refused several
calls for help, so Otts decided to try to save his sister's cat
Monday, when temperatures dipped into the 30s.
   Otts, who suffers from asthma and ``a small fright of heights,''
said he climbed about 90 feet before he grew too cold and tired to
continue. And as he climbed higher, Spooky scaled higher.
   ``He went up a little further, and then I went up a little
further, and then I went up a little further to where I couldn't get
down,'' he said. ``I've never been that high before.''
   It took firefighters 45 minutes to get Otts down, and when he was
back on the ground, he cursed at police officers, Police Chief
Everett Little said.
   Otts said officers ``started telling me how much (the rescue
effort) was costing the city. And I said, `Well that's what I pay
taxes for.'''
   He was arrested and taken to police headquarters, where he
received a summons alleging disorderly conduct and was released on
$50 bond. He is scheduled to appear in court Dec. 15.

<HEAD>Judge Rules To Extradite American Wanted in California Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former U.S. Marine charged in a string
of sex murders in California was ordered extradited to the United
States, where he could face the death penalty if convicted.
   The lawyer for 27-year-old Charles Ng said he will appeal the
ruling, issued Tuesday after a six-week hearing.
   Justice Marguerite Trussler of Alberta Court of Queen's Bench
said Ng should be extradited on 19 of the 25 offenses he is charged
with in California.
   Ng is charged with murder, kidnapping and burglary in connection
with the deaths of 12 men, women and children.
   Eleven of the deaths involved sex slayings at a rural cabin in
Calaveras County, 120 miles east of San Francisco. The 12th involved
the death of a San Francisco disc jockey.
   In her decision, Ms. Tussler cited evidence from Ng's alleged
partner in the crimes, Leonrd Lake.
   Ng came to Canada after Lake was picked up for shoplifting in San
Francisco and committed suicide. Lake later was linked to the deaths
or disappearances of several people. That investigation led to the
charges against Ng.
   ``I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt based on all the
evidence ... that there was a general conspiracy that related to
weapons, money and sexual gratification,'' the judge said.
   Defense attorney Don MacLeod has said appeal arguments could take
the case all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, which could
take up to five years.
   The defense is seeking to invoke a provision in the Canada-U.S.
extradition treaty that says extradition may be refused unless the
requesting state guarantees the fugitive will not be executed if
convicted. Canada does not have the death penalty.
   Ng, who was born in Hong Kong and educated in British private
schools, is serving a 4{-year sentence at a maximum-security federal
penitentiary in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, for shooting a security
guard in the hand in December 1985 during a shoplifting attempt at a
department store in Calgary.
   Ms. Trussler told a hushed courtroom she was satisfied, on
evidence filed during a six-week extradition hearing, ``that the
offenses charged in the state of California are extraditable with
one exception.''
   The exception was a charge of accessory to murder.
   The judge dismissed five other charges of kidnapping and
conspiracy to kidnap because no evidence was shown of transportation
of the three people involved, as required under Canadian law.
   The judge said she would issue a warrant keeping Ng in prison in
Canada until he is turned over to U.S. authorities.
   In Sacramento, Calif., Gov. George Deukmejian urged Canadian
officials to act quickly on the court ruling.
   Deukmeijian said delays would make the prosecution of Ng in the
United States more difficult. ``There are few crimes in modern times
that are more heinous as the atrocities attributed to Charles Ng,''
Deukmejian said.

   Here is a summary of the outlook for U.S.
agriculture in in 1989, according to newly released Agriculture
Department reports.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EXPORTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   U.S. export values should rise by about $1 billion to $36.5
billion in fiscal year 1989, while volumes are forecast to decline
by 8 percent to 136 million metric tons. The U.S. share of world
grain trade is expected to slip to 48 percent from 50 percent this
year.

that included the effects of the drought.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FARM INCOME</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Net farm income, which includes rising values of inventories of
commodities, will increase by about 20 percent to between $44
billion and $48 billion in 1989. Cash farm income is expected to
fall about 10 percent to $48 billion to $52 billion. Higher
production costs and lower direct government payments will draw down
cash gains from rising farm prices.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PRODUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   U.S. production of wheat, corn and soybeans is expected to
rebound in 1989 in response to higher prices from drought-reduced
harvests this year. For some crops, the government also has eased
its land-idling requirements for subsidy programs. In general,
global grain and soybean stocks are down about one-third this year,
with reserves good for about two months of use for grains and 1{
months for soybeans.

<HEAD>Sikh Leader Critically Injured After Trying To Unite Political

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Sikh leader was shot and critically
injured after initiating moves to unite the main Sikh political
party, and militant Sikhs were believed responsible for the attack,
news reports said.
   Jagdev Singh Talwandi was shot Tuesday in the village of Talwandi
in northern Punjab state, the Press Trust of India reported.
   Two of his bodyguards were killed and at least one other person
was injured in the attack, according to the report.
   Talwandi is leader of one faction of the Akali Dal, the Sikhs'
splintered political party.
   On Monday, he met with other Sikh leaders to unite the party,
newspapers said. At least one faction agreed to unite, the
newspapers said.
   Sikh militants, fighting for an independent homeland since 1982
in Punjab, have been generally opposed to the moderate Akali Dal.
   The party has split into three major groups _ Talwandi's own
faction, the United Akali Dal and the Akali Dal of former Punjab
Chief Minister Surjit Singh Barnala.
   The United Akali Dal and Talwandi's group agreed to unite, but
there was no word on the talks with Barnala's representatives.
   Sikh form 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are a
majority in Punjab.
   The militants claim they are discriminated against by the
majority Hindus, who make up 80 percent of the population.
   In other violence in Punjab, militants killed at least six people
Monday night, news reports said.
   The deaths raise to 2,323, the number of civilians killed by the
militants in the state this year. At least half of the victims have
been Sikhs who were accused by the militants of being traitors.

   A devastating chemical explosion that
killed six firefighters at a highway construction site and shattered
windows 10 miles away was caused by arson, police said.
   Detectives questioned four people to ``evaluate their alibis'' in
Tuersday's pre-dawn fire that triggered the blast, but no arrests
have been made, said Sgt. Gregory Mills, a police spokesman.
   Fire bells tolled throughout the city for the six firefighters,
who were killed when a construction trailer loaded with 30,000
pounds of ammonium nitrate exploded, ripping a large crater in the
ground and virtually obliterating a fire truck.
   Another explosion occurred 40 minutes later in a nearby trailer
that stored 15,000 pounds of the material, which is used in highway
construction projects to make dynamite explode more evenly.
   ``A lot of guys just find it hard to believe,'' said fire Capt.
Owen Gilchrist. ``No one wants to. Another five or 10 minutes, there
could have been 20 or 30 guys down there.''
   Mills said investigators determined arson from the presence of
two separate fires burning almost simultaneously at the site. One
blaze, in a small pickup truck, started in the cab. The second began
500 feet away in the trailer containing the explosives, he said.
   Police said they had no motive for the arson, but did not rule
out that the fires could have been set as a prank. A special squad
of six homicide detectives and one arson detective was working on
the case.
   Labor union officials said there had been no problems at the
site, where workers had been blasting to clear rocks for a highway
project. The only reported crime had been a vandalized bulldozer
last month, police said.
   Two pumpers manned by the six firefighters had been called to the
site by security guards who noticed two prowlers in the area and saw
the pickup on fire, said fire department spokesman Harold Knabe.
   According to fire department transcripts, a dispatcher informed
firefighters that explosives were in the area as they approached the
scene. Battalion chief Marion Germann had just pulled up in a car
about a quarter mile from the scene and was ``in the process of
ordering his firefighters out when the explosion hit,'' Mills said.
   ``He saw a strange burning pattern,'' the police spokesman said.
   Germann estimated the firefighters killed in the blast were about
30 to 40 feet from the burning trailer.
   The blasts left two large craters, 30 to 40 feet wide and 6 or 7
feet deep, and a smaller one about 15 feet across and 4 feet deep.
Thousands of windows were blown out of businesses, homes, schools,
banks and hospitals up to 10 miles away.
   ``The remains of one fire truck is sitting very close to one
crater,'' Knabe said. ``There is another vehicle of some sort, a
large red truck. The other fire truck _ there is absolutely no
evidence that it was ever there.''
   One witness a few miles away, Cindy Denning, said that when the
flash of light brightened her bedroom, she thought nuclear war had
begun.
   ``I woke up and my first reaction was it's nuclear war, or else a
gas explosion in my building. I thought the building probably was on
fire,'' she said.
   Apartment buildings, including Ms. Denning's, and nearby houses
were evacuated for several hours by authorities who feared more
explosions, Mills said.Debris was scattered over several acres
around the construction site and onto nearby U.S. 71.
   The dead firefighters were identified as Capt. Gerald C.
Halloran, 57; Capt. James Kilventon Jr., 54; firefighters Thomas M.
Fry, 41, Luther E. Hurd, 31, and Michael R. Oldham, 32; and Robert
D. McKarnin, 42, a fire apparatus operator.
   The accident was the worst in the fire department's history. Five
firefighters were killed in a 1959 gasoline storage tank explosion.

<HEAD>Top Soviet Official And Afghan Guerrilla Leaders To Meet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrilla leaders will meet
with the Soviet deputy foreign minister, Yuli Vorontsov, in Saudi
Arabia this weekend, an insurgent spokesman said.
   ``The meeting signifies that they recognize us as a legitimate
force in Afghanistan,'' Hamed Karzai, spokesman for the Liberation
Front of Afghanistan guerrilla group, said Tuesday.
   The leader of the front, Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, will attend the
meeting along with Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of the
Jamiat-e-Islami group and chairman of the seven-party guerrilla
alliance based in Pakistan, Karzai said.
   Moscow's decision to send Vorontsov, who also became Soviet
ambassador to Afghanistan last month, ``shows they are willing to
reach a political understanding,'' Karzai said.
   Moslem guerrillas, backed by the United States, began fighting in
Afghanistan after a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet military
forces entered the country in December 1979.
   Under a U.N.-mediated agreement, the Soviets began withdrawing
their estimated 115,000 soldiers May 15. Half were confirmed to be
out by Aug. 15, and the agreement requires the rest to be gone by
Feb. 15, 1989.
   The insurgents were not parties to the negotiations or the
withdrawal agreement and have asked repeatedly for direct talks with
the Soviet Union.
   Karzai said the agenda of the meeting in Saudi Arabia is
flexible, but he and several other guerrilla representatives said
the form of a postwar government was not on it.
   Determining the form of government ``is the right of the people
of Afghanistan and it will not be compromised,'' Karzai said.
   He said the willingness to meet with the insurgents indicates a
decline in Kremlin support for the Afghan government of President
Najib.
   ``They realize they have no alternative; they have to abandon
Najib,'' he said.
   Guerrilla leaders have refused Najib's offers of a power-sharing
arrangement.

   Norman Collins was speeding toward the
construction site when he heard the blast he had feared and felt his
car shake.
   Collins, the president of Mountain Plains Construction Inc., of
Kansas City, Kan., had been awakened minutes earlier by a security
guard at the highway construction site where his company was doing
work. A storage trailer was burning, and Collins, knowing it
contained the explosive ammonium nitrate, made sure the fire
department was called and raced to the scene.
   Halfway there, he felt the blast.
   ``I was afraid of what it was,'' he said.
   In the early-morning darkness Tuesday, six firefighters died when
30,000 pounds of the chemical, used as a dynamite additive in
construction, exploded at the site in south Kansas City.
   The firefighters were extinguishing an arson fire in a pickup
truck when they noticed the blaze in the trailer. Two pumper trucks
drove up an access road to the blaze, and the firefighters were
killed instantly when the trailer containing the chemicals exploded.
   A few miles away, when the flash of light brightened her bedroom,
Cindy Denning thought the worst.
   ``I woke up and my first reaction was it's nuclear war, or else a
gas explosion in my building. I thought the building probably was on
fire,'' she said.
   When Ms. Denning looked out the window, she saw what resembled
``something out of a war movie'' _ people in nightclothes, some
carrying children and possessions, shouting and scrambling to get
into cars in the cold.
   Police cars with loudspeakers drove through another apartment
complex a half-mile away from the construction site across a heavily
wooded ridge, warning residents to evacuate for fear of a second
explosion.
   The second blast was not as loud as the first. But it still
sounded ``like a volcano erupted,'' said apartment resident Tamara
Taylor. She and her husband, Kerry, grabbed their 9-year-old
daughter and fled.
   ``All the glass in the apartment broke. Everything exploded in
midair,'' Mrs. Taylor said. ``I heard the police say the word
`evacuate,' and that was all I needed to hear. It scared the living
daylights out of me.''
   The explosions, which created two huge craters at the
construction site, knocked out electricity for blocks in the
surrounding area. Many people in the metropolitan area thought they
had felt an earthquake or a natural gas explosion.
   Neighborhoods just to the north of the blast site looked as
though they had been ravaged by riots. Thousands of windows were
blown out of businesses, homes, schools, banks and hospitals up to
10 miles away. Property damage was expected to total in the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
   At the 4-Acre Motel three-quarters of a mile from the blast site,
doors were blown off hinges, scores of windows were broken and the
explosion blew a lock out of a door.
   ``It's just like a bomb, really,'' said motel clerk Dee
Cornelius. ``Property you can fix up, but those poor firemen.''
   Flags flew at half-staff around the city and fire bells tolled at
9 p.m. to mark the worst loss of life in the history of the Kansas
City Fire Department.
   Firefighter John Seise, who was manning an emergency shelter at a
nearby apartment complex for people who had to evacuate their homes,
knew all six of the dead firefighters.
   ``I tell you what, I haven't come to grips with it,'' Seise said.
``I just can't get it off my mind. You never realize how vulnerable
you are in this business until something like this happens.''

<HEAD>Joe Montana and Wife Make Dramatic Appeal To Kidnapper</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quarterback Joe Montana and his wife made an
emotional televised appeal to the kidnapper of a 9-year-old girl who
is the object of an intense FBI search that has yielded few clues
and left police baffled.
   The San Francisco 49er star said Tuesday the thought of losing
one of his two daughters to a kidnapper ``just about brings tears to
our eyes. To watch another parent going through that is just
devastating to us. We just pray that it never happens to us and
that, hopefully, these children will come back.''
   Michaela Joy Garecht was abducted Nov. 19 from a supermarket
parking lot near her home in Hayward, across the bay from San
Francisco. An 8-year-old girl who was with Michaela described the
man as white, 18 to early 20s, 6 feet tall with shoulder-length,
blond hair and a pockmarked or pimpled face.
   ``We're here as parents ... to ask the kidnapper of Michaela to
please release her,'' said Montana said, responding to an unusual
request from the FBI's San Francisco office.
   Authorities also announced an intensive effort to find Michaela
by sending 40,000 information packets to truck stops, hospitals and
police departments nationwide. They include recent photos of the
blond-haired, blue-eyed youngster and an artist's sketch of the man
who took her.
   Jennifer Montana said she thinks about the kidnapping every day
when she's with her children, Alexandria, 3, and Elizabeth, 23
months.
   ``We went looking for a Christmas tree last night,'' she said.
``I called out to my daughter, (who was) running to other trees. I
tried to keep a close eye on them, but they're monsters and they're
everywhere.
   ``I called out for Alexandria and she didn't answer,'' she said.
``I called her twice and she didn't answer. Immediately that
(kidnapping) goes through my mind. I said, `You answer me right
now.' And I hear in the distance, `Yes, mama.' And my heart starts
to pump again. That's the way it is.''
   Montana said he and his wife have become ``very cautious'' about
their children, ``and we urge everybody else to be.''
   FBI spokesman Chuck Latting said the agency contacted Montana
because ``we thought this would be a very appropriate public figure
that people would stop and listen to. He was extremely receptive to
doing this.''
   Latting couldn't recall another kidnapping case in which an
unrelated celebrity was asked to make a public appeal for the return
of the victim.
   ``This is a totally different type of kidnapping than usual,''
Latting said. ``It's a child and there's no demand for ransom and no
correspondence. ... It's just a snatch off the street.''
   Dick Held, special agent in charge of the San Francisco office,
said it's highly unlikely that Michaela's kidnapper is looking for
money, ``so it puts law enforcement in a position where we're really
totally dependent on the public to get involved.''
   More than 100 police officers and FBI agents earlier this week
searched the wooded hills nearby without finding any evidence.
   At least a dozen FBI agents are working full time on the case,
Latting said, along with at least two dozen more investigators from
Hayward and neighboring police agencies.
   ``We have never had an investigation of this magnitude,'' Hayward
Police Officer Ray Alsdorf said.

   A moderate earthquake jolted Alaska's most
populous area, but there were no immediate reports of damage,
officials said today.
   The tremor, which registered about 5.4 on the Richter scale,
struck at 11:56 p.m. AST Tuesday and was centered about 80 miles
west of Anchorage, said Bill Zitek of the Alaska Tsunami Warning
Center in Palmer.
   The quake was felt throughout Anchorage and ``very strongly in
Palmer,'' where ``it woke everybody up,'' he said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion in which every
increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a
reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of
6.5.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable
damage, and 6 can be severe.
   The quake which killed 131 people in Alaska in 1964 registered
8.4 Richter, and the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was estimated
at 8.3.

   Israeli soldiers ambushed two heavily armed

   No Israeli soldiers were hurt in the gunfight, the spokeman said.
   The clash occurred late Tuesday, southeast of the Lebanese
village of Barashit in the Israeli-controlled security zone in
southern Lebanon, the spokesman said. Barashit is about five miles
from Israel's northern border.
   ``The Israeli force noticed during a routine patrol that a squad
was moving southeast of Barashit,'' the military spokesman said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The force stormed the squad
and one guerrilla was killed. Another escaped.''
   The dead guerrilla was armed with hand grenades, submachine guns
and rocket-propelled grenades, the army spokesman said.
   It was not immediately clear whether the guerrillas were headed
to Israel to launch an attack on an Israeli settlement, the army
spokesman said.
   Last month, eight Israeli soldiers were killed when a car bomb
exploded in the security zone, not far from the Israeli border.
   Israel carved out the security zone, a narrow strip of land
running along the northern border, when it withdrew the bulk of its
forces from Lebanon in 1985. Israeli troops now patrol the area
together with the South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed militia.

   Leaders of 25 major U.S. Jewish groups urged
Israeli leaders to oppose a proposal to grant Orthodox rabbis sole
power over conversions to Judaism.
   The delegation met with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres on Tuesday, the first day of a two-day visit
to Israel, to protest the so-called ``Who is a Jew'' legislation.
   Four religious parties emerged as power brokers in the Nov. 1
election. They won a promise from Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc
that a Likud-led government will pass the measure.
   Such legislation has been proposed in various forms, including as
an amendment to the Law of Return, which defines who may become an
Israeli.
   The law now defines Jews as those born to a Jewish mother or
converted to Judaism. The amendment would add the phrase ``converted
according to Orthodox regulations.''
   Most affiliated American Jews belong to the Reform and
Conservative streams of Judaism, and many consider such legislation
a symbolic repudiation. It would prevent Reform and Conservative
converts from emigrating to Israel under the Law of Return.
   Rabbi Daniel Syme of Stamford, Conn., vice president of the
Reform movement's Union of American Hebrew Congregations, said the
delegates told Shamir and Peres of the ``tremendous anger,
frustration and disillusionment'' felt by American Jews over the
proposed changes.
   Syme called Shamir's reaction a ``non-response, a lack of
recognition of the significance of the issue.'' He said Shamir made
no promises.
   Shamir later met with Orthodox rabbis from the United States who
backed the proposed legislation.
   Shamir has said he would keep his promise to the religious
parties even if Peres' left-of-center Labor Party joined a Likud-led
coalition and rendered the religious parties superfluous.
   Before the religious parties struck a deal with the Likud, they
engaged in negotiations with Labor, which offered wide-ranging
concessions on the ``Who is a Jew'' issue.
   In his meeting with the American delegation, Peres ``acknowledged
his error in seeking an accommodation with the religious parties,''
Syme said.
   ``He indicated he was prepared to remove the religious agenda
from the table of negotiations and in effect challenge the prime
minister to join him in that commitment,'' Syme said.
   Peres said later on Israel radio: ``I explained to them that we
shall vote against the change in the Law of Return.''
   The American delegates said they proposed to Shamir and Peres a
three- to five-year moratorium on religious legislation to give
Orthodox rabbis and diaspora Jews a chance to work out a compromise.
   The delegates represent most major American Jewish groups,
including Reform, Conservative, Orthodox and secular organizations.
More than 30 meetings with Israeli politicians and religious leaders
were scheduled during the two-day visit.

   A journalist won the 1988 National Book Award for
non-fiction with a book about the Vietnam War, and a newspaper
columnist took the fiction prize for a novel about the murder of a
girl in Georgia.
   Neil Sheehan, 52, author of ``A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul
Vann and America in Vietnam,'' and Peter Dexter, 45, who wrote
``Paris Trout,'' were honored Tuesday night at an awards ceremony
attended by 500 people.
   The authors each received $10,000 and a Louise Nevelson sculpture.
   ``I feel like a man who was on a long voyage of discovery ...
who's finally come home,'' said Sheehan, his eyes damp with tears as
he accepted the award for his book, which took him 16 years to write.
   Sheehan was United Press International's Vietnam bureau chief in
1962 and worked for The New York Times from 1964 to 1972. He
obtained the Pentagon Papers in 1971 while working for the
newspaper. Sheehan is the author of ``The Arnheiter Affair.''
   ``A Bright Shining Lie'' tells the story of the Vietnam War
through the eyes of Lt. Col. John Paul Vann, a troubled but
dedicated career officer who spoke out against the brutality and
ineffectiveness of the early U.S. strategy in Southeast Asia.
   Sheehan, a resident of Washington, said he wrote the book hoping
that ``it would help my country ... come to grips with the war.
   ``The most moving reactions I get are from Vietnam veterans who
write or call and say, `You put me back there. That's what it was
like. For the first time I know what it was all about. I know why it
happened the way it happened,''' he said.
   ``That's very moving. That's what I wanted to achieve.''
   Dexter's novel is about the murder of a 14-year-old black girl by
a white man in a small Georgia town just after World War II.
   The book was inspired by a shooting that took place when he was a
child in Milledgeville, Ga. ``I just started putting that together
and remembering things and that sort of became the spine of the
novel,'' he said.
   Dexter, a columnist for The Sacramento (Calif.) Bee and a
frequent contributor to national magazines, said the novel's success
would not lead him to give up his column, which he writes three
times a week.
   ``I'm not someone to hole up in the woods and produce a novel
every two years. I like being on the street and hearing different
voices,'' said Dexter, who has written two other novels.
   The books honored Tuesday were published by Random House, whose
editorial director, Jason Epstein, also was honored. Epstein was the
first winner of the National Book Awards Medal for Distinguished
Contribution to American Letters.
   ``This is really a happenstance,'' Robert Loomis, executive
editor of the publishing house, said of the awards sweep.
   Other fiction nominees were:
   Don DeLillo for ``Libra''; J.F. Powers for ``Wheat That Springeth
Green''; Mary McGarry Morris for her first novel, ``Vanished''; and
Anne Tyler for ``Breathing Lessons.''
   The other non-fiction nominees were:
   Peter Gay for his biography, ``Freud: A Life For Our Time''; Eric
Foner for ``Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution,
1863-1877''; Brenda Maddox for ``Nora,'' a biography of James
Joyce's lifelong companion and muse; and Jack McLaughlin's
``Jefferson and Monticello.''
   The National Book Awards, established 38 years ago, are awarded
by a panel of judges chosen by the National Book Awards Inc., a
non-profit institution dedicated to creating a wider audience for
American literature.

   His house was a crumbling shell and most of
his belongings were broken or gone, but tornado victim Robert D.
Keys managed some humor as he surveyed what had been his bedroom.
   ``Get a load of this,'' he said Tuesday, holding up a sopping
paperback book entitled ``How to Survive the '80s.''
   ``I guess it taught us something.''
   Survival was uppermost in the minds of Keys and hundreds of
others who began putting their lives back together after rampaging
tornadoes cut a destructive swath through heavily populated northern
Raleigh early Monday.
   Two Raleigh residents were among the four killed in the state;
157 were injured in the night of terror that state officials said
caused an estimated $100 million in damage.
   Survivors voiced gratitude for life and health as they salvaged
what property they could and looked to the future.
   ``You've got to joke a little bit, cry a little bit, grunt and
grumble ... but then move on,'' said Keys, associate professor of
crop science at North Carolina State University.
   Affected neighborhoods were beehives of activity on the sunny,
cool day Tuesday. Sightseers gawked, police watched abandoned houses
for looters, and crews replaced lost road signs. The buzz of chain
saws, pounding of hammers and roar of heavy machinery at times
drowned out conversations of residents who traded stories of their
brush with death as they worked.
   Keys said he, his wife and two daughters jumped out of bed and
dashed ``like frightened jackrabbits'' to the small, first-floor
hallway seconds before a twister tore into their split-foyer house.
No one was hurt; the roof and second-floor walls were blown away,
but the first floor was left standing despite heavy interior damage.
   When Keys ventured upstairs, he saw that a sturdy, 50-foot oak
had tumbled across his bed. ``If we'd still been there, it would
have been goodbye,'' he said.
   Nearly unrecognizable under limbs and debris in Keys' back yard
was wreckage of a 34-foot motor home that had been parked on the
street in front of his next-door neighbors' house. Lee DiMond and
her family were trying to attach a tow truck to a twisted car
blocking access to the motor home.
   ``We only moved in two weeks ago,'' said Ms. DiMond, 23, an
employee of GE Mortgage Insurance Co. Soon she and her sister,
Daisy, will move into an apartment with their three dogs _ a fourth
died in the tornado _ and a few salvaged belongings.
   ``It didn't get my closet, so I've got some clothes,'' she said.
``But just about all the furniture's gone. We're going to try to get
my washer and dryer started.''
   Several miles to the southwest, residents of the Cooper's Pond
apartment complex gingerly climbed over piles of rubble. Four
buildings were destroyed and four others may have to be razed and
rebuilt, manager Deidre Kauder said.
   Residents streamed into the manager's office seeking advice, some
unhappy that they weren't allowed to enter rickety buildings.
``Anything you've got in there, consider it lost,'' an assistant
manager told one disenchanted tenent.
   Jennifer Rogers' parents helped her search the pile. Her husband,
Ed, was hospitalized with back injuries after the couple, who were
in bed when the tornado hit, were tossed down a 60-foot embankment
as their apartment disintegrated.
   ``We're alive, thank God,'' the 24-year-old schoolteacher said.
Later came another miracle: a neighbor discovered her wedding ring
embedded in a tree stump.

   A leading Soviet chess player who
secretly married the U.S. team captain and defected during the Chess
Olympiad flew to the United States with her husband, a U.S.
Consulate spokeswoman said today.
   Susan Elbow of the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt said Elena
Akhmilovskaya, the second-ranked player on the Soviet team, and her
husband, John Donaldson, left on a Pan Am flight late Tuesday.
   Ms. Elbow said she did not know the couple's destination in the
United States.
   Donaldson, the U.S. chess team's non-playing captain, married Ms.
Akhmilovskaya on Friday during the international tournament in
Athens. The 31-year-old U.S. international master is from Seattle.
   The couple arrived in Frankfurt on Saturday to wait for an
immigrant visa for Donaldson's wife. It was received Tuesday.
   The couple met during a chess tournament in Cuba in 1985.
   Apparently fearing the reaction of Soviet team officials, they
decided to leave Greece before the end of the Olympiad after news of
their wedding became public.

   A sailor on the USS Nimitz was killed
today and another was injured when an aircraft gun accidentally
fired and hit another warplane, causing a fire on the flight deck,
military officials said.
   The fire was controlled in about 20 minutes, but six aircraft
parked on the deck were damaged, the officials said. The 90,944-ton,
nuclear-powererd aircraft carrier continued its mission in the North
Arabian Sea.
   The incident occurred about 2:50 a.m. while crews were performing
``trouble-shooting maintenance'' on the parked aircraft, according
to spokesmen in the Persian Gulf region and at U.S. Central Command
headquarters in Tampa, Fla.
   The identities of the casualties were withheld pending
notification of family members.
   Navy officials said the injured sailor was flown to a
U.S.military hospital in West Germany. U.S. sources said he suffered
burns over at least 70 percent of his body.
   Chief Petty Officer Joe Bartlett, a public affairs officer aboard
the Navy's Persian Gulf flagship, USS La Salle, said a gun mounted
on an A-7 Corsair fired by accident, hitting an A-6 Intruder parked
nearby.
   The ensuing fire caused ``major or minor damage'' to six
aircraft, most of them A-7s, Bartlett said. Firefighters using foam
and water brought the blaze under control, he said.
   The officials said they did not know what type of gun was
involved, but the Corsair fighter-bomber is normally equipped with
20mm cannons. The A-6 Intruder is an all-purpose combat aircraft.
   The officials said an investigation into the incident had begun.
   The Nimitz arrived in the Arabian Sea on Oct. 29 with an
eight-ship battle group to support U.S. naval operations in the
Persian Gulf.
   The carrier, commissioned in 1975 and based at Bremerton, Wash.,
carries about 80 aircraft and has nearly 6,000 people on board. In
1981, a Marine jet crashed onto the Nimitz's flight deck off
Florida, killing 14 people.
   The death of the sailor brought to 50 the number of Americans
killed in military operations in the gulf and nearby waters in the
past year and a half.
   Thirty-seven of those died when the missile frigate USS Stark was
mistakenly attacked by Iraqi aircraft in the Persian Gulf on May 17,
1987. The others were victims of eight crashes involving helicopters
or planes.
   Three crewmen were lost Nov. 11 when a Navy helicopter crashed in
the Arabian Sea while preparing to land aboard the frigate USS
Barbey, one of the Nimitz's battle group.

   A court-appointed physician decided Ferdinand
Marcos is healthy enough to face criminal racketeering charges in
New York, but Marcos' attorney refused to say whether the exiled
Philippine president would seek a second opinion.
   ``We received word that Dr. (Francis) Weld decided the president
was healthy enough to travel to New York,'' said spokesman Gemmo
Trinidad. ``But we have received no official report on the matter
and I'm going to have to refer all other questions to our lawyers.
   ``I'm with the president, I see him every day, and it's clear he
is not well, not healthy enough to travel, no matter what the
doctors say,'' he added.
   Trinidad said he did not know when the 71-year-old Marcos was
expected to appear and would not disclose his reaction to the news.
   Defense lawyers contend Marcos is too frail to make the 10-hour
flight and a hearing is scheduled Monday before Judge John Keenan in
New York.
   Marcos' attorneys have said they would seek medical tests by
``neutral'' physicians if their client was judged fit to travel, but
San Francisco attorney John Bartko said Tuesday the defense team
would read the full report before making its next move.
   ``We'd advised him that there would undoubtedly be various
opinions about the state of his health,'' Bartko said. ``Until we
read the full report, we'll reserve judgment about what we should do
next.''
   Marcos has been using a wheelchair since he and his wife, Imelda,
were indicted Oct. 21 on criminal racketeering charges accusing them
of plundering the Philippines' treasury and stashing much of the
money in the United States.
   He has been treated in the past for eye ailments, chest pains,
severe headaches and calcium deposits near the knees. In recent
appearances, Marcos has also worn a neck brace.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges Oct. 31 in New York
and was released on $5 million bail provided by tobacco heiress
Doris Duke, a close friend who owns a home here.
   The same day as his wife's court appearance, Marcos was examined
for about three hours at Tripler Army Medical Center here. Weld, a
cardiologist at New York's Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, refused
then to comment on his findings.
   Marcos fled to Hawaii in February 1986 after a military-civilian
revolt ended his 20-year rule and catapulted Corazon Aquino to the
presidency.
   In an interview with the Associated Press early this month,
Marcos said he doubted whether he would live through a criminal
trial, raising the health issue that his attorneys have frequently
said would play a major role in the case.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commuters climbed aboard military trucks for an
unusual ride to work today after the government called out the army
to carry people stranded by a bitter transit strike.
   Two out of four regional express train lines were paralyzed for a
third straight day by a maintenance workers strike called by the
Communist-led General Confederation of Labor.
   Disruptions have spread to the Metro and city buses. But most
Metro lines were functioning normally and the transit agency
reported about 60 percent of the buses were running.
   More than 200 military vehicles were on hand to help get people
to work, but even with up to 25 people crammed into a truck the
fleet can only carry a fraction of the capacity of the express
trains.
   ``I feel like a victim,'' said computer operator Houria
Bendahmane after a two-hour ride from the suburb of St.
Germain-en-Laye west of Paris. ``We were well-assisted, but frankly
it was not too comfortable. It was cold and windy and wet.''
   Commuters arriving in trucks at the Porte d'Orleans at the
southern edge of Paris said it took 90 minutes on clogged highways
for what is normally a 30-minute ride on the train.
   ``These are military trucks usually used for logistical
transport, but we're trying to make them as comfortable as
possible,'' Jean-Pierre de Valence, spokesman for the military
governor of Paris, said on French radio. ``I'm sure that with good
humor everyone will understand it's something interesting.''
   At the Porte de Vincennes in eastern Paris, soldiers who just
finished working the morning rush hour reported a cheerful
atmosphere.
   ``People took it very, very well. There was joking and
story-telling between the passengers and the soldiers,'' said
Patrick, a soldier who refused to give his last name. ``It lifted
everybody's morale.''
   More military vehicles were headed to the capital, and officials
said several hundred private buses were also being chartered to
replace the missing trains.
   Michel Rousselot, head of the Paris Autonomous Transit Agency,
said early today after 14 hours of meetings with representatives of
the labor federation and six other unions that the agency was
sticking to the salary offers the unions have rejected.
   The federation, the dominant union at the transit agency, is
demanding increased safety measures and across-the-board pay
increases of $170 per month.
   The transit agency has offered immediate monthly raises of about
$25 plus bonuses ranging from about $17 to $100 per month. For next
year, the agency is offering an increase of 2.2 percent.
   The current average monthly salary is about $1,100.
   After the meeting, the labor federation and a smaller union, the
French Democratic Confederation of Labor, both called for the strike
to continue, while the other unions said they would consult their
members.
   President Francois Mitterrand said Tuesday on national television
that the government acted wisely in calling out the army, rather
than give in to ``a small number of persons, cabable of blocking an
entire system.''
   The opposition conservatives in the National Assembly introduced
a censure motion condemning the social policies of Socialist Premier
Michel Rocard.
   Alain Juppe, secretary-general of the rightist Rally for the
Republic party, said that ``by seeking an unfindable consensus,
Michel Rocard is paralyzed.''
   In recent weeks, nurses, postal employees, government office
workers and other public service staff have staged strikes, all
seeking wage increases higher than those called for in Rocard's
policy of economic ``rigor.''

   Soviet pianist Vladimir Viardo says his
government has granted him permission to live and work in the United
States for two years with his family.
   ``I must say when people ask me where I live, I would say I live
in Moscow. My workplace is all the world,'' Viardo, 39, told a news
conference Tuesday at Steinway Hall.
   Viardo's wife, Natalia, was scheduled to leave for Moscow today
so she could bring their children, 11-year-old Philip and 4-year-old
Alexander, to America.
   Travel restrictions on Soviet citizens have eased under Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms. Previously, many of the
relatively few Soviets allowed to go abroad had to leave their
families behind to ensure their return.
   Viardo won the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in
Fort Worth, Texas, in 1973, and gave concerts in the United States
in 1974 and 1975.
   But he was not permitted to return to this country until this
year, when he came to play a concert last summer. After a trip to
Buenos Aires, he returned to the United States in September to play
in several concerts and teach master classes. Earlier in the year,
he played in European music festivals.
   Viardo said Tuesday that he would teach at University of North
Texas in Denton, which has promised him all the time he wants to
travel and give concerts.
   Why Texas?
   ``I'm a Texas winner (the Cliburn competition) and a Texas
citizen,'' Viardo said. ``Friends were made first in this area. They
were very supportive and they are.''
   Viardo said he was invited to stay at University of North Texas
as an artist in residence after giving a master class at the school.
   He said he and his wife then sought advice from Cliburn and
others before writing a letter to the Soviet ambassador in
Washington seeking permission for the Texas stay.

   Cats are leading a dog's life here as
City Council has ruled that leash laws pertaining to Rover also
apply to Fluff and Mittens.
   Under a law that effective Friday, all cats in Naperville must be
inoculated and wear identifying collars. In addition, if the cats go
outdoors and set foot on any street, alley or other public place,
they must be on leash.
   The same rules, adopted on a 5-1 vote late Monday, apply to dogs,
but the leash requirement was already part of the existing animal
control ordinance.
   Violators face fines of $35 to $200 and the threat of
confiscation of cats. Authorities will attempt to contact the owners
of any seized cats through registered letter, but after seven days
the animals could be put to death.
   ``It's absurd,'' said James Vandendorpe, who spoke out against
the proposal at the meeting. ``My family has had our cat for eight
years, and he's always worn a collar, but there's no way he's going
to become used to a leash at his age.''
   The new cat laws were supported by members of the Naperville
Humane Society, and by village Animal Control Officer Kim Johnson,
who said she needed it to combat various cat nuisances.
   ``It's pretty hard to get people to understand that dogs can't
run at large and poop in your garden, but cats can,'' said Police
Chief James Teal.

   The president of Estonia today defended his
republic's fight for greater autonomy after legislators denounced
its declaration of sovereignty during heated debate over proposed
constitutional changes.
   Arnold Ruutel addressed the 1,500-member Supreme Soviet on the
second day of the parliament's debate over reforms put forward by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last month. Gorbachev says the 120
articles of legislation are the first major step toward a political
system based on law, not central dictate.
   Ruutel told fellow deputies that economic and environmental
problems prompted Estonia's declaration of sovereignty Nov. 16 over
all internal affairs and its demand to review all new Soviet
legislation.
   Ruutel said he appreciated some of the amendments to Gorbachev's
proposed reforms that were announced Tuesday, as well as plans to
``widen and defend the sovereign rights of republics'' in the next
stage of reform. But he indicated Estonia still is not satisfied
with the plan being debated.
   The reforms are to be voted on Thursday.
   In particular, Ruutel said Estonia would prefer to retain its
current Supreme Soviet, or parliament, rather than having the
nation's 15 republics create a Congress of People's Deputies.
   The congress concept is the base of Gorbachev's political reform.
   After nearly three hours of open session, the Presidium, the
nation's highest executive body, and two committees of the Supreme
Soviet met in closed session to discuss suggestions made by deputies.
   Ruutel did not mention statements of other Estonian leaders, who
have indicated they plan to ignore last week's action by the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet nullifying Estonia's sovereignty
declaration.
   Many deputies echoed some of Estonia's complaints about the
restructuring, but most of the speakers berated the small republic
for passing a constitutional amendment giving it the right to veto
Soviet laws.
   The Estonian action ``undermines the unity and principles of our
multi-national state,'' said a deputy from Vladimir, a town about
120 miles east of Moscow.
   ``These are anti-social actions,'' the deputy said.
   Some deputies apparently misunderstood Estonia's action.
   One speaker complained the republic had already canceled all
Soviet laws.
   Most national newspapers have published criticism of the Estonian
action without explanation of the changes made by the republic in
its law.
   At Tuesday's session, Gorbachev bowed to criticism of his
proposed reforms, saying he would accept tighter limits on
presidential power and try to accommodate the republics seeking
greater autonomy.
   ``It is obvious that some of the provisions of the bills were not
formulated precisely enough and caused quite a few critical remarks
in the course of discussions,'' Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet.
   Some have said the draft laws actually stengthen the presidency,
which Gorbachev assumed on Oct. 1, and strengthen Moscow's power
over that of the Soviet republics.
   Legislators left the parliamentary session Tuesday night with
their first written copies of the 88 changes made by Kremlin leaders
_ a remarkable response to the criticism of the original reforms.
   Gorbachev said the amended draft gave the Supreme Soviet the
right to veto decrees of the Presidium, the highest executive body,
and of the president himself.
   Some officials, including the presidents of the Latvian and
Lithuanian republics and the Communist Party chief of Georgia,
called for more changes.
   Many deputies supported Gorbachev, but the objections came from
such disparate locations as Leningrad, the Ukraine and the obscure
autonomous region of Bashkiria.
   ``In my constituency, a barometer would find a large storm around
the changes to the constitution,'' said a deputy from Zaporozhets
identified only as Zhilovsky.
   Citizens were particularly concerned about curbing the power of
Moscow ministries whose factories pollute with impunity, and
eliminating a plan to allow organizations like the Communist Party
and trade unions to elect one-third of the new Congress of People's
Deputies, he said.

   About 12,000 people cheered today when
demonstrators burned an American flag and shouted slogans to protest
U.S. military bases and an alleged government crackdown on militant
labor unions.
   Also today, the military reported eight people were killed in
three separate shootings on southern Mindanao island.
   The rally was sponsored by the militant May First Movement on the
125th birthday of Andres Bonifacio, a 19th-century leader of the
struggle against Spanish colonialists.
   A smaller rally was held in Cebu, the country's second-largest
metropolitan area about 350 miles southeast of Manila.
   In Manila, police said the protesters, many carrying red banners,
totaled about 12,000. They burned a U.S. flag in front of the main
post office.
   Before the march, speakers called for the release of jailed union
leaders and the crowd shouted slogans such as ``U.S. bases, a
plague!'' and waved banners calling for dismantling the six American
installations here.
   Leto Villar, vice chairman of the Movement, told the crowd the
government was mounting an anti-communist propaganda campaign, but
``we know that communism is not the cause of poverty.''
   Leftists have accused the police and military of cracking down on
legal left-wing organizations, including the May First Movement. Two
leaders of a Movement-affiliated transport workers union were
arrested last week and charged with inciting sedition after leading
a strike of passenger jeep operators.
   The military says the Movement is a communist front, but union
officials deny the charge.
   During one speech, about 10 youths wearing handkerchiefs over
their faces walked to the middle of the podium carrying a sign
supporting the Kabataan Makabayan, or Nationalist Youth, the youth
wing of the banned Communist Party of the Philippines.
   Earlier, about 200 hooded youths shouted ``Revolution!
Revolution!'' and threatened Manila's police chief during a rally
marking the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Nationalist
Youth.
   Protesters scattered after the brief rally, and police made no
arrests.
   The military said unidentified gunmen fired Tuesday on a
passenger jeep in Mindanao's Lanao del Norte province, killing five
women. The military said the slaying may have stemmed from a family
feud.
   Also Tuesday, a woman was killed in Lanao del Norte when two men
believed to be Moslem rebels fired on a truck carrying about 20
hitchhikers.
   In a third incident, suspected Communist rebels shot to death a
soldier and a civilian riding a motorcycle Tuesday in Surigao del
Sur province in eastern Mindanao, the military said.

   The Supreme Court today delayed for six months
the appeal of Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk after his defense
attorney committed suicide, Israel radio reported.
   An employee of the court confirmed a delay in the hearing,
originally scheduled Monday, but would not give the new date.
   Demjanjuk, a retired U.S. autoworker, was sentenced in April to
death for committing crimes against humanity and against the Jewish
people.
   He was accused of being ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a guard who
operated gas chambers in the Treblinka death camp where 850,000 Jews
were killed during World War II.
   The 68-year-old Demjanjuk, who lived in the Cleveland suburb of
Seven Hills before being extradited to Israel in 1986, claims he is
the victim of mistaken identity.
   Demjanjuk's attorney, Dov Eitan, died after throwing himself from
the 15th floor of an office building in downtown Jerusalem on
Tuesday. Eitan, a 53-year-old former judge, had joined the defense
team in August.
   Police ruled his death a suicide but said Eitan left no note
explaining his motives.
   Eitan was to have presented 60 percent of Demjanjuk's appeal,
according to Demjanjuk's son-in-law, Ed Nishnic.

   Riot police hurling tear gas broke up a
march today by hundreds of students and workers who tried to reach
the presidential palace to demand the arrest of former president
Chun Doo-hwan.
   Also today, political leaders considered a recommendation by a
presidential panel that drastic curbs be placed on the national and
military intelligence agencies to end their domestic spying and keep
them out of politics.
   Thousands of riot troopers in green combat fatigues and visored
helmets blocked the protesters with shields as they tried to march
towards the palace. ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan! Punish (President) Roh
Tae-woo!'' protesters yelled.
   Police scuffled with protesters after they marched out of a city
center subway station where they first held an evening rally to
demand Roh be removed from office and Chun be put on trial for human
rights abuses.
   Unable to break through the police lines, 1,500 protesters then
marched through the main shopping district, yelling slogans and
scattering leaflets.
   A few firebombs were hurled at a government office but did not
cause any damage. Riot police moved in to disperse the marchers with
tear gas grenades.
   Dozens of protesters hurled firebombs and rocks at police in a
brief clash as other marchers fled.
   There were no reports of arrests or injuries.
   The protest was smaller than major protests Nov. 19 and 26 when
thousands of people demanding Chun's arrested clashed with police in
Seoul.
   About 200 students demanding Chun's arrest battled police with
firebombs in a separate protest Wednesday in Songnam on Seoul's
southern outskirts.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing, went
into internal exile last week after apologizing to the nation for
alleged corruption and human rights abuses under his rule.
   Roh appealed for mercy for Chun, but opposition and dissident
groups insist the former president answer questions about the
alleged corruption.
   Several of Chun's close associates and relatives have been
convicted of or charged with corruption and other offenses. The
former president has denied he was involved in any corruption.
   Government officials had no immediate response to recommendations
made Tuesday by the Public Administration Reform Commission, which
was set up by Roh to recommend government changes.
   The commission said the Agency for National Security Planning,
formerly known as the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, should
confine its domestic activities to fighting espionage and
subversion. It should not be used for political purposes and should
operate under the law, the agency said.
   ``The agency has been criticized harshly by the people because of
its political maneuvers and abuse of power which resulted in human
rights violations,'' said Shin Hyun-hwack, chairman of the
commission.
   The commission also recommended confining the military's Defense
Security Command to gathering and analyzing military intelligence.
   The national security agency, which would still conduct overseas
intelligence operations, is a large, shadowy organization that often
has played a major role in enforcing the rule of past authoritarian
governments.
   Both intelligence agencies have traditionally play major roles in
domestic politics.
   Roh in a speech to the nation Saturday pledged to revise the
tough national security laws often used by the agencies.
   Roh, a former general who won presidential elections in December,
has pledged to remove authoritarian controls.
   Other recommendations included limiting the number of domestic
offices of the national security agency; reducing its authority
within the government; and subjecting the agency to government
auditing.
   Government sources, meanwhile, indicated a new Cabinet and other
major changes would be announced by early next week. Up to 11
ministers could be removed because of their ties with Chun,
according to press reports.

<TEXT>
   Police have arrested two Mexican teen-agers
and were seeking two others in a sniper attack that killed one
person and wounded two others rafting down the Rio Grande.
   Presidio County Sheriff Rick Thompson said the assailants
apparently began shooting at the victims on a whim.
   ``We have no motive for the shootings,'' he said. ``They saw them
coming down the river and decided to shoot at them.''
   Both suspects gave statements, but Thompson declined to discuss
their statements further.
   Police arrested Eduardo Pineda Rodriguez, 17, on Tuesday at his
parents home near Redford, Thompson said. Rodriguez is a Mexican
citizen but a legal resident of the United States.
   Rodriguez and a 16-year-old boy, whose name was withheld because
of his age, were charged in the Nov. 19 shooting death of Michael
Heffley, 40, of Eastland. They also were suspected of wounding
Heffley's wife, Jamie, 32, and rafting guide, Jim Burr, Thompson
said.
   The 16-year-old was arrested by Chihuahua state judicial police
in Ojinaga, Mexico, Thompson said. Police were seeking two other
teen-age suspects, both of whom were believed to be in Mexico.
   Under international law, a person standing in one country who
fatally shoots a person in another country can be tried in either
nation.
   The attackers opened fire on the trio as they floated on the Rio
Grande through the Colorado Canyon, about 22 miles east of Redford.
   Mrs. Heffley and Burr said their assailants stalked them from a
300-foot-high canyon rim on the Mexican side of the river, which is
about 75 feet wide, as they abandoned their bullet-riddled raft and
scrambled up the river bank.
   Shortly after the attack, Mrs. Heffley recalled that her husband
``threw me out of the line of fire so he took the bullet.''
   Mrs. Heffley was shot in the left side and left shoulder. Burr,
36, suffered a shotgun wound to the right thigh. Heffley was killed
after he was shot in the back with a .30-30 rifle, police said.
   ``I really consider him to be a hero,'' Burr said. ``He was
shielding her in a very exposed area. He gave up his life for her.''
   Mrs. Heffley said she was pleased to hear of the arrests.
   ``I'm glad that they are being caught and I think this incident
should be made a public example,'' she said. ``I think they should
be executed, because if they are not, relations will never get
better across the border. Nobody should have to go through this kind
of torture.''

   Police arrested three men in the death of a
Chicago motorist killed in what authorities called a game of
hit-and-miss played by dropping concrete blocks from a viaduct on
cars passing below.
   ``They said they had nothing to do, so they decided to play a
game and give points for hits and near-misses,'' an investigator
said Tuesday.
   Authorities believe the three had been dropping heavy rocks and
concrete blocks from a viaduct over Interstate 57 since August,
police said.
   The three, Leon DeRouin, 18, Kevin J. DeLorenzo, 19, and Matthew
E. Taylor, 19, were charged in the death of Charles Layfield, 57.
Layfield was decapitated Friday when the truck he was riding in was
hit by a 15- to 30-pound chunk of concrete thrown from an overpass.
   Police received anonymous tips from people who said the youths
bragged about the incident, said Capt. Ladd Fruge.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The co-pilot of a hijacked TWA
jetliner testified today that Mohammed Ali Hamadi came into the
cockpit carrying a gun seconds after a U.S. Navy diver was shot
aboard the aircraft.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is being tried on murder and
air piracy charges in the 1985 jetliner hijacking. He has admitted
hijacking the Athens to Rome flight with an accompllice and
diverting it to Beirut, Lebanon.
   But Hamadi has denied killing U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem
during the ordeal in which 39 Americans were held hostage for 17
days.
   Describing the circumstances of Stethem's shooting, the co-pilot,
46-year-old Philip G. Maresca, told the court: ``I was able to peek
out of the corner of my eye and I thought I was able to determine
that a passenger ... was being dragged to the front of the plane.''
   ``Then I heard a gunshot. A short time later, about 10 to 15
seconds later, Hamadi came into the cockpit with a gun in his hand.
   ``Then Uli Direckson (the flight purser) came in very distressed
and said one of the passengers had been killed,'' Maresca said,
fighting back tears as he described the scene.
   The diver's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem, listened
quietly during the testimony. The elder Stethem took notes as he has
done regularly since the trial began on July 5.
   Hamadi sat nearly motionless listening to an Arabic-language
interpreter translate Maresca's testimony. Other witnesses have
testified they believed Hamadi killed Steham, but no one has said
they saw him do it.
   Outside the high-security courtroom, scores of police, some
carrying machine guns, patrolled the area.
   During his testimony, Maresca said he did not see the shooting
``because Hamadi said look forward and not behind and not to pay
attention to any noise.''
   Maresca also described how the hijackers beat the crew every time
they tried to establish radio contact with other aircraft or
airports in the area.
   Maresca said he felt Hamadi was the leader of the two hijackers.
U.S. officials have identified the other as Hassan Ezzeddine,
another Lebanese Shiite Moslem.
   ``Hamadi appeared to me, and it was a very strong impression,
that he was the leader. He spoke on the radio. He grabbed the
microphone most of the time. He did most of the beatings'' of the
crew,'' Maresca said.
   ``He was more volatile, very excitable. The other hijacker tried
to restrain Hamadi when he was extremely abusive. Hamadi had the gun
most of the time and he made most of the demands on us,'' Maresca
said.
   In keeping with court policy on security for former hijacking
hostages, Maresca was not asked to give his current address.
   Before Maresca's testimony, Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger
accepted a defense motion made last week that Hamadi be given a
psychiatric examination. The defense claims Hamadi was mentally
disturbed at the time of the hijacking.
   The judge said Hamadi would undergo three days of phsychiatric
tests soon.
   Hamadi was arrested Jan. 13, 1987 at Frankfurt airport after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

   A physician sentenced to 21 months
in jail for refusing to serve in the army was released on bail today
so he can appeal his sentence.
   Ivan Toms, who ran a health clinic for blacks, was imprisoned in
March for refusing to report for military service.
   Magistrate A.P. Kotze released Toms on $420 bail today so he can
file for a review of his sentence at the Appeal Court in
Bloemfontein. No date has been set for the hearing.
   Toms' lawyers argued that he should not have received the maximum
prison sentence of 1{ times the length of the required military
service.
   Toms completed the mandatory two years of military service in
1979 and reached the rank of lieutenant in the medical corps. But he
has refused to attend the periodic follow-up service also required
of all white males.
   Prior to his imprisonment, Toms ran a clinic in the black
squatter camp of Crossroads outside Cape Town. Local residents
called him the ``angel of Crossroads.''
   Toms described the military as ``the ultimate upholder of
apartheid.''
   The government will not say how many white men refuse to serve in
the military. The last time a figure was disclosed, in 1985, 7,589
men declined to serve. Military duty is required of all South
African white males, but service by non-whites is voluntary.
   Under South Africa's policy of apartheid, the 26 million blacks
have no voice in national affairs, which are controlled by the 5
million whites.

   A nationwide furor over
segregation intensified today after one right-wing town council
voted to consider a curfew for blacks and two removed portraits of
the president from their chambers.
   The Conservative Party, which depicts President P.W. Botha's
limited reforms as capitulation to the black majority, provoked the
controversy by implementing strict segregationist policies this week
in some of the dozens of municipalities it won in local elections
Oct. 26.
   Three towns in Transvaal Province _ Carletonville, Boksburg and
Brakpan _ voted in recent days to ban blacks from public facilities
that were integrated in recent years. Such facilities include public
parks, toilets and sports centers.
   The Carletonville council went a step further Tuesday night,
ordering a study of whether a curfew should be imposed barring
blacks from the mining town at night.
   Conservative Party officials said curfews would be reintroduced
in any towns where its councils felt the security of whites was
threatened.
   In Carletonville and Springs, a small industrial city 25 miles
east of Johannesburg, the Conservative-controlled councils voted
Tuesday to remove photographic portraits of Botha from their
chambers. They replaced them with the municipal coat of arms.
   In one ward in Boksburg, voters cast ballots today for a town
council vacancy in a by-election viewed as a referendum on the
segregation issue.
   A Conservative Party candidate was competing with an independent
backed by Botha's National Party, which has denounced the
restoration of ``petty apartheid'' even though it has made no moves
to repeal the legislation allowing segregation of local amenities.
   The Conservatives' resegregation campaign has drawn criticism
from business leaders and sports officials, as well from
anti-apartheid leaders. In Boksburg, blacks have begun a consumer
boycott of white-owned businesses and some have withdrawn accounts
from local banks.
   Liberal politicians, while joining in denunciations of the
Conservative Party decisions, have noted that many public facilities
are segregated in municipalities controlled by the National Party.
   ``Exactly the same bigotry and selfishness is tolerated and
condoned by Nat leadership,'' said Douglas Gibson, Transvaal leader
of the liberal Progressive Federal Party.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha acknowledged some whites-only signs
remain on public facilities in Nationalist-controlled cities, but
said: ``We are in a process of removing them.''
   ``The Conservative Party knows very well it is endangering white
security,'' said Botha, who is not related to the president. ``Their
own supporters will in the near future have to pay the price for
their unnecessary emotional outburst of racism.''
   A presidential council Tuesday rejected a bill proposing to
enforce residential segregation laws and recommended it be redrafted
to ease penalties and decriminalize some offenses.
   The bill was referred after a deadlock in Parliament, where it
was passed by the National Party-dominated white chamber but
rejected by the Asian and mixed-race chambers.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's majority 26 million blacks have
no representatives in Parliament and no vote in national affairs.

   More than 60 firefighters were treated early
today after inhaling noxious fumes as they battled a factory blaze
that prompted evacuations of up to 500 people, officials said.
   Tuesday night's fire at Diverse Plastics Inc., which makes
auto-related plastic products, burned some of the 700, 50-gallon
stacked drums of isocyanate, said Flint Township Supervisor Rod
Shumaker.
   ``It's not so much flammable but it emits this noxious smoke,''
he said of the chemical. ``It's not fatal but it does affect
breathing.''
   At least 66 firefighters were being treated for fume inhalation
at several hospitals, said Don Rowley, fire chief in the Genesee
County community.
   ``They've inhaled enough of it that they need to be monitored.
They've gone to every hospital in the area,'' said Randy Strong,
Shumaker's assistant.
   Shumaker said officials feared more firefighters would need
medical help, as ``residual symptoms might take 72 hours to show
up.''
   One other firefighter was treated for a dislocated shoulder,
officials said.
   Between 400 and 500 residents were evacuated after the flames
were reported about 8 p.m., and most were sent to the township hall
or a church in nearby Swartz Creek, Shumaker said. They were allowed
to return to their homes at 3 a.m.
   More than 200 firefighters from 28 departments in Genesee,
Shiawassee and Saginaw counties responded to the blaze as chemical
drums exploded, Rowley said.
   The fire, which damaged half the plant, was doused by 11:15 p.m.,
but firefighters remained at the scene to mop up, he said.
   The cause of the fire and the amount of damage was not determined.

   The search by President-elect George Bush and
his top aides for a person to fill the No. 2 slot at the Pentagon
appears to be hindering the selection of John Tower as Defense
secretary, sources close to the transition say.
   Tower, former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is
known to want to head the Pentagon, and Bush could name him as early
as today, according to the sources.
   But Bush has pulled a few surprises since his election Nov. 8 so
there's a chance he could find someone else for defense. Among those
mentioned are Paul O'Oneill, chairman of Alcoa, and Norman Augustine
of Martin Marietta.
   Bush may also make his decision on the CIA public this week.
There is some talk that William Webster, the current CIA director,
may be asked to stay on for a while.
   Here are some other departments and agencies:
   _ Several published reports indicate Rep. Willis Gradison, an
eight-term congressman from Ohio, is a leading candidate to become
secretary of Health and Human Services. Gradison, 59, says the
reports are a mystery to him.
   ``Nothing has happened, no one has phoned me,'' he said.
   _ At Energy, word is that Charles Imbrecht, chairman of the
California Energy Commission and a big booster of alternate fuels,
is a strong candidate. For the record, Energy Secretary John
Herrington says he's packing his bags to head back to California.
   _ Former Michigan Gov. William Milliken is still being spoken of
for the Environmental Protection Agency, or maybe the Interior.
Other EPA candidates still strong are Mike Deland, regional
administrator in Boston, and Francis Blake, former general counsel
to the regulatory relief task force and also formerly EPA's general
counsel.
   Rep. Claudine Schneider's name has come up for Interior, but she
says she's pretty sure she doesn't want the job. Still being
mentioned is Sen. Dan Evans of Washington for Interior.
   _ Samuel K. Skinner, a longtime Bush supporter in Illinois and
now the chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority in the
Chicago area, is a strong candidate for transportation secretary.
   Sources, speaking on condition they not be named, say members of
the Bush transition team have contacted Skinner, 50, a former U.S.
attorney and close associate of Illinois Gov. James Thompson.
Skinner was state campaign director during the presidential campaign.
   Others are also under consideration for the job. Among the names
that have surfaced are Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., and Craig Fuller,
co-director of the Bush transition office and his vice presidential
chief of staff.
   Martin, however, says she really wants to become chairman of the
House Republican Conference. House GOP members will vote on that job
Dec. 5.

   Actor Griffin O'Neal, who received a
suspended sentence and 1{ years probation for reckless boating that
caused the death of a friend, has been accused of violating his
probation.
   O'Neal, the son of actor Ryan O'Neal, has failed to perform the
400 hours of community service that was a condition of his
probation, Deputy State's Attorney Gerald Anders said Tuesday.
   O'Neal, a California resident, could face 30 days in the Anne
Arundel County Detention Center.
   He was sentenced in the 1986 Memorial Day accident that killed
Gian-Carlo Coppola, the 23-year-old son of director Francis Ford
Coppola.
   O'Neal and Coppola were in a rented powerboat on the South River
when the boat piloted by O'Neal crossed a towline, killing Coppola.
   Joseph Touhey, O'Neal's Maryland attorney, said his client admits
violating his probation terms. Touhey declined to say whether O'Neal
would plead guilty.
   O'Neal will return in January to face the charge, Anders said. No
court date has been set.

<HEAD>Report Warns Of Environmental Disaster In Poland</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A report by the Polish Academy of Sciences
has warned of ``a complete breakdown'' of the environment in 27
areas of Poland inhabited by more than 12 million people, officials
said today.
   The report, summarized in the leading newspapers, was called ``A
Judgment of Effectiveness and Directions of Action in the Field of
Shaping and Protecting the Environment.'' The party daily Trybuna
Ludu said, ``It should be called `Judgment of Uneffectiveness'.''
   According to the report, Poland ranks second in Europe in sulfur
dioxide emission, most Polish rivers lack drinkable water, most
beaches on the Baltic Sea have been closed, and the amount of
industrial wastes in the country has increased by nearly half in the
past five years.
   A spokeswoman at the academy, the country's foremost research
institution, said the report was prepared by a committee of the
academy earlier this year and was now being made public.
   ``There has been a complete breakdown of the state of natural
balance in 27 areas'' inhabited by one-third of Poland's 38 million
people, the newspaper Zycie Warszawy said in its summary of the
report.
   ``It shows in a degradation of the natural order, incapability
(by the environment) for self-cleansing and an increase of diseases
resulting from the state of the environment.''
   The report said that economic losses stemming from environmental
problems were also huge, amounting to 10 percent of the country's
annual national revenue.
   It said industrial dust in the air of the southern Silesia
region, the center of Poland's mining and metal industries, had a
carcinogenic influence on living tissue, causing cancer or genetic
deformations.
   The government newspaper Rzeczpospolita suggested that increased
enforcement of environmental laws and other legal remedies should be
used to improve the environment.
   In recent weeks, government officials have expressed increasing
concern about the environment, and the newly appointed government of
Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has said that addressing
environmental problems will be one of his top priorities.
   In one of its first acts, the government permitted the closing of
a chromium-producing factory near Wroclaw, in Silesia, for
environmental reasons.
   There is also a budding independent environmental movement, with
at least two groups of activists _ Freedom and Peace and the Polish
Ecological Party _ devoted to pointing out environmental problems.

   A toddler's five-organ transplant was
``smoother and much easier'' than the only other time such surgery
was performed, and she should do as well as a liver recipient,
doctors say.
   Rolandrea Dodge, 3, of Fruitland, N.M., was awake today and was
being weaned from the respirator, said Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh spokeswoman Sue Cardillo. ``She's a very bright little
girl. I'm sure if she could she'd be asking what's going on.''
   Rolandrea was in the hospital's intensive care unit in critical
condition, which is considered normal after multiple transplants.
   She received a liver, pancreas, stomach, small intestine and part
of a large intestine during a 16{-hour operation that ended Tuesday
afternoon. Her spleen also was removed in the experimental surgery.
   Rolandrea's heart was functioning normally after the operation
and her new liver was producing bile, said Dr. Satoru Todo, who
headed the surgical team at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. She
also was moving her hands and legs to the delight of her parents,
Branden and Cyndi Dodge.
   ``The prognosis is very difficult to say, but I'm expecting it to
go well,'' Todo said Tuesday.
   ``At this point, you don't know where you are other than that you
got through the surgery very successfully,'' said Dr. William
Donaldson, the hospital's medical director.
   The operation went smoothly except for one episode when the
chilled organs, which came from an unidentified young victim, were
inserted into Rolandrea's 30-pound body, Todo said. Her body
temperature dropped dramatically and her heart stopped beating for
about a minute.
   Surgeons restarted her heart with cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   The only other five-organ recipient, Tabatha Foster, 3{, of
Madisonville, Ky., underwent the operation at Children's Hospital
last November. She died six months later of a blood infection, but
survived longer than any of the three Americans who had had
abdominal transplants involving two or more organs.
   ``This time, it went smoother and much easier. This baby doesn't
have any previous surgery'' as Tabatha did, Todo said.
   Doctors plan to give Rolandrea less anti-rejection medication
than they gave Tabatha so her immune system is stronger and she is
less susceptible to infection, Todo said.
   There is no reason why she should not fare as well as liver
transplant patients, he said. ``We have to be very careful.''
   About 80 percent of the hospital's liver transplant children
survive the first year.
   Rolandrea, who is known as Rolly, arrived at Children's Hospital
in mid-October to be evaluated for a multiple organ transplant.
   Rolly was born with an incurable disease called intractable
secretory diarrhea, which prevented her intestines from absorbing
food and liquids. She had to be fed intravenously, although she was
allowed occasional nibbles of candy, potatoes and other solid food.
   Aside from brief outings, Rolly has spent her entire life in
hospitals. Doctors in New Mexico said she wouldn't survive long
unless she underwent a multiple organ transplant.
   The girl's liver began failing about three months ago as a result
of her high-protein intravenous feedings, and her skin became
jaundiced because of bile pigments in the blood.
   Doctors began administering an experimental drug on Nov. 9 in
hopes of allowing her intestines to absorb food and liquids, but it
was unsuccessful, said hospital spokeswoman Sue Cardillo.
   Doctors decided a week ago to proceed with a multiple organ
transplant as soon as a suitable donor was found.
   Dodge, 27, a coal miner, said shortly after arriving in
Pittsburgh that it was difficult deciding whether to allow Rolly to
undergo the operation. But, he said, ``It's the only hope that we've
got left.''

<TEXT>
   President R. Venkataraman has turned down
a plea for mercy by a Sikh condemned to die for the 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, a government official
said today.
   The president's rejection clears the way for Satwant Singh and
Kehar Singh to be hanged Friday morning, according to a Home
Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Venkataraman denied Kehar Singh's mercy petition on Thursday, the
official said. The Cabinet had urged the president to deny the
request.
   Satwant Singh, 30, refused to appeal for clemency.
   United News of India said preparations for the execution were
under way at the maximum-security Tihar Central Jail.
   Mrs. Gandhi was gunned down in the garden of her residence on
Oct. 31, 1984, by two Sikh bodyguards _ Satwant Singh and Beant
Singh. Beant Singh was killed in a shootout with other security
guards.
   The two men are not related. All Sikh males, according to
doctrine of their faith, take the name Singh, which means ``lion.''
   Kehar Singh, Beant Singh's maternal uncle, was arrested a month
after the assassination and accused of helping plot Mrs. Gandhi's
murder.
   After an eight-month trial, Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh were
convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. An appellate court and
the Supreme Court rejected numerous appeals.
   Mrs. Gandhi was apparently murdered in revenge for an army raid
she ordered on Golden Temple, the Sikhs' holiest shrine. More than
1,200 people, most of them Sikhs, died.
   The shrine, in the northern state of Punjab, was being used as a
base by militant Sikhs fighting for an independent homeland. More
than 1,200 people died in the raid, most of them Siksh.
   Sikhs form only 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are
in a majority in Punjab.
   Radical Sikhs have been campaigning for a separate state since
1982, claiming discrimination by Hindus, who make up 80 percent of
the population.
   This year, more than 2,300 people have been killed.

<TEXT>
   The government today threatened to close
the Yugoslav Consulate following a four-day diplomatic row over the
shooting of a Croatian teen-ager during a demonstration.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke demanded ``full cooperation'' from
Yugoslav authorities after 16-year-old Joseph Tokic was wounded in
the throat Sunday when a security guard inside the consulate fired
on hundreds of demonstrators.
   ``It is appropriate we put directly to the Yugoslav authorities
what the implications of non-cooperation are,'' he said. Hawke said
there was no question of the guard being allowed to return to
Yugoslavia and if any charges were to be filed, they would be made
in Australia.
   Foreign Minister Gareth Evans threatened to close the consulate
following a vigorous diplomatic wrangle over police access to the
guard accused of shooting the protester. Police were allowed to
interview the guard Tuesday.
   Evans said closing the consulate was ``under serious
consideration'' and warned of adverse consequences between Australia
and Yugoslavia if the guard did not surrender to police to face
criminal charges.
   He called the incident ``intolerable'' and warned any plea for
diplomatic immunity would be rejected.
   Hawke earlier made a stern plea to new immigrants to leave their
racial problems behind. He said ``do not turn Australia into a
battleground.''
   Australia, with a population of 16.5 million, has a large
Yugoslav community.
   Yugoslavia lodged a strong protest over what it called a lack of
police protection during the incident and has not issued a formal
apology for the shooting, leading to criticism from Australian
newspapers and politicians.
   The statements by the prime minister and his foreign minister
follow a four-day standoff over access to the security guard,
identified as Matijas Zoran. Yugoslav consul-general Stanojlo Glisic
defended the shooting on grounds he was at risk when demonstrators
jumped the walls.
   ``I would like you to face that mob with four people outside and
rest inside,'' he said. ``One (demonstrator) took a rubber hose and
struck me on the face ... so the security guard realized it was
dangerous. I was almost half-blinded by the chaos.''
   Police upgraded their presence at the consulate following a bomb
scare they linked to Sunday's demonstration. A police official said
all cars in and out of the consulate were being searched in case
Yugoslav authorities tried to spirit Zoran, the security guard, out
of the country.
   Tokic remained in stable condition at St. Vincent's Hospital.
Doctors said they were contemplating a second operation to remove
the bullet from his throat. The boy's parents said they expected
their son to regain use if his voice in about one week and called
him a ``very, very good boy.''

   A man doused himself with gasoline in his
family's living room and struck a lighter, igniting a fire that
killed him, his mother and a stepbrother, authorities said.
   Another stepbrother suffered second-degree burns over 12 percent
of his body, and five other relatives were injured in the blaze
Tuesday night at the home in the Astoria section of Queens,
officials said.
   Anthony Dyke, 27, apparently was despondent ``over a broken
romance,'' said John Mulligan, a fire department spokesman.
   The blaze spread to the rest of the house when Dyke ran upstairs
``in a ball of fire, possibly to get into the shower, maybe to
extinguish the flames,'' Mulligan said.
   Firefighters found Dyke's body in the bathroom. His mother,
Marlena Newberry, 53, was found behind the front door, and his
stepbrother, Kyle, 19, was found in the first floor living room.
   All three apparently died of burns and smoke inhalation, said
another fire department spokesman, Al Brown.
   The fire was under control shortly after firefighters arrived but
the structure was heavily damaged.
   ``There's nothing left,'' said neighbor Barbara Perricone, who
described the building as a brick, one-family row house.

   The Kremlin ideology chief says the new policy of
greater openness will not be extended to books by Alexander
Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel Prize-winning author thrown out of the
country for his anti-government views.
   The novels are not beneficial to society, Vadim A. Medvedev said
at a news conference Tuesday.
   ``What we have here is a struggle against our system as such. ...
I am against the publication of a number of works by Solzhenitsyn,
and in the first place such works as `Lenin in Zurich,' and the
`Gulag Archipelago,''' he said.
   ``To publish Solzhenitsyn's works would mean to, in effect,
undermine the foundations on which today's life rests,'' Medvedev
said.
   Medvedev, the newest member of the ruling Politburo, is regarded
as one of those closest to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater openness, many
prohibited works have been published.
   Some writers, artists and activists in informal political groups
have urged that Solzhenitsyn's works be published and that he be
allowed to visit the Soviet Union.
   The author was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974 and lives
in Cavendish, Vt.
   Medvedev is considered a theoretician of many social and economic
reform policies, but his statement made clear there still are limits
on the amount of openness allowed under Gorbachev's reforms.
   Solzhenitsyn's novel ``One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich''
was published in 1962 during the thaw allowed by Nikita S.
Khrushchev after the death of Stalin. But the remainder of his major
works remain unpublished in his native land.
   ``Gulag Archipelago,'' Solzhenitsyn's masterpiece, is a chronicle
of Soviet political repression. ``Lenin in Zurich'' is part of a
cycle of books Solzhenitsyn still is completing about the 1917
Bolshevik revolution, and traces the life of Vladimir I. Lenin in
exile in the years just prior to the Soviet takeover.
   Medvedev was chosen Kremlin ideology chief in a shake-up of top
Communist Party and government jobs by Gorbachev this year.
   Medvedev said that in Solzhenitsyn's work, ``a position is being
developed which radically contradicts our social and political
system, our understanding of the world, of history, our attitude
toward Lenin.''

   The prime minister indefinitely
suspended government concessions to lumber companies today after
uncontrolled logging was blamed was for many of the 367 deaths
caused by recent floods.
   In two districts of Nakhon Sri Thammarat province _ where 267 of
the 367 bodies were found _ mud, logs and trees cascaded down
denuded hills, slamming into houses and burying villages. The
disaster affecting 12 southern provinces occurred during a week of
heavy rains starting Nov. 19.
   Officials say 385 people remained missing and 2,057 were injured
in the worst natural disaster in Thailand in recent decades.
   ``We will reduce or revoke the concessions as much as the Thai
law permits and punish poachers and violators severely,'' government
spokesman Suvit Yodmani quoted Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan
as saying.
   He said lumber imports from Burma, Laos, Malaysia and Brunei
should supply all of Thailand's needs. ``From now on, the ministry
will not give concessions'' to lumber companies, said the
agriculture and cooperatives minister, Sanan Kachornprasat, after a
Cabinet meeting.
   Sanan said permits already given were immediately suspended. A
total of 301 concessions are affected, according to the Forestry
Department. Sanan said firms involved in illegal logging will have
their contracts terminated.
   The search for survivors extended into remote areas today and 21
more bodies were retrieved. With some roads and communications lines
repaired, soldiers and other rescuers reached previously cut off
areas, said Col. Bunchorn Chavarnsil, a military spokesman. Ethnic
Chinese clairvoyants tried to help find bodies buried in mud, said
Bunchorn.
   He said the 25 clairvoyants in long robes meditated to call out
to the dead in the single most devastated area, hilly Phipoon
district of Nakhon Sri Thammarat. Two ethnic Chinese-funded charity
groups which help retrieve bodies in disasters invited the
clairvoyants there, he said.
   ``We appreciate all the help we can get, in any form,'' he said.
``The sooner we account for everybody, the sooner we can rebuild
from this tragedy.''
   Bunchorn said the clairvoyants on Thursday will conduct funeral
services.

   Major environmental groups today presented more
than 700 recommendations to President-elect George Bush, calling at
the top of their list for action to combat global warming from the
``greenhouse effect.''
   One recommendation is for a big increase in required fuel
efficiency for automobiles.
   The coalition of 30 environmental groups, organized as
``Blueprint for the Environment,'' also called for raising the
Environmental Protection Agency to full Cabinet status and
increasing its budget by about 20 percent. The fiscal 1989 budget
contains about $l.5 billion for EPA operations.
   In all, the coalition proposed increased spending of about $5.5
billion for a variety of environment-benefiting programs, including
$2 billion for mass transit.
   The groups recommended $12.9 billion in tax increases, most of
that from higher taxes on gasoline and other fuels. They asked
spending cuts totaling $2.2 billion, including an end to what they
said were subsidies to the nuclear power industry.
   Thomas B. Stoel Jr., a staff attorney of the Natural Resources
Defense Council who served as chairman of Blueprint for the
Environment, said, ``Humanity's exploitation of the world's energy
and other resources, global warming of the atmosphere, pollution of
the air, water and land, and poisoning of the world's oceans
threaten to choke off worldwide economic progress. Indeed, they
threaten the physical viability of the planet itself.''
   He said the United States was no longer the leader on
environmental issues and that regaining that status ``will be the
first and most important task for President-elect Bush.''
   Many scientists believe that the globe faces a warming of 3 to 8
degrees fahrenheit on average by the middle of the next century.
   This warming is caused by the trapping of the earth's heat by
gases emitted into the atmosphere by human activity, most
importantly carbon dioxide from burning fuel. That trapping of heat
is called the greenhouse effect.
   Peter A.A. Berle, president of the National Audubon Society, said
that to counter such a warming and to combat other air pollution
problems such as acid rain, Bush should ``order that improved energy
efficiency be the top priority of the Energy Department.''
   Berle said setting such a priority would require increasing
emphasis on renewable technologies such as solar systems and raising
the fuel efficiency of U.S. automobiles to 45 miles per gallon from
the current requirement of 26.5 mpg.
   Stoel had breakfast with Bush this morning and presented a
summary of the group's recommendations, which were contained in 16
volumes being distributed to the Bush transition team for study and
use by various departments.
   Bush has made environmental protection a theme of his campaign,
calling for, among other things, new controls on the sources of acid
rain if the government's current $5 billion, five-year ``clean
coal'' demonstration projects don't bring enough pollution reduction.
   Other groups in the coalition include Defenders of Wildlife, the
Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, the National Wildlife
Federation, Friends of the Earth, and the Izaak Walton Club.

   A senior Iranian official has denied
allegations that Iranian authorities recently executed thousands of
political prisoners, Tehran radio reported today.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Deputy Foreign Minister
Mohammad Javad Larijani as saying that ``only those who have taken
arms against the Islamic revolution or tried to kill people have
been tried and executed.''
   Speaking at a news conference in the Iranian capital Tuesday,
Larijani said that allegations of executions of anti-government
elements in Iran were propaganda statements from world imperialist
powers, the radio said.
   Larijani's remarks followed an Islamic Republic News Agency
report Monday that six clerics and three other men were executed
earlier this month after a religious court found them guilty of
being ``implicated in various offenses.''
   Iran's main opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, or Peoples'
Holy Warriors, claimed Tuesday that 5,000 political prisoners have
been executed in Iran since August.
   The Iraqi-based group said in a statement that the executions
were carried out on orders from Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   The Mujahedeen claim, made in a statement telexed to The
Associated Press in Nicosia from the group's headquarters in
Baghdad, Iraq, could not be independently confirmed. But it followed
a U.N. report issued earlier this month condemning Iran for ``a wave
of executions'' of opposition leaders after accepting a cease-fire
in its war with Iraq.
   Dissident Iranian sources have claimed that the executions are
part of a continuing power struggle within the government. They
claim infighting has intensified since the Aug. 20 cease-fire
between Iran and Iraq.

<HEAD>Judge Begins Closed Hearing After Courtroom Checked For Bugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A closed court hearing on secret documents
Iran-Contra prosecutors want to use as evidence against Oliver L.
North was convened today after security officers checked the
courtroom for electronic bugs.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell took the bench behind
closed doors after court security officials used electronic
equipment to ``sweep'' the courtroom to satisfy themselves that no
listening devices had been planted.
   The hearing began a day after Gesell upheld all but one of the
key charges that the former National Security Council aide illegally
diverted U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels and
lied to Congress.
   With virtually all the pre-trial motions disposed of, the judge
today turned his attention to the equally difficult issues posed by
the thousands of pages of classified government documents each side
wants to use as evidence in the trial.
   North attended the hearing with his attorneys, Brendan V.
Sullivan Jr. and Barry Simon. A plainclothes security agent who
usually accompanies the retired Marine lieutenant colonel to court
was not allowed in the courtroom.
   The secret proceeding was convened to consider North's objections
to deleting sensitive references from 350 classified documents
covering 1,000 to 2,000 pages that independent counsel Lawrence E.
Walsh wants to use as evidence in the case.
   North contends the references to foreign countries and U.S.
intelligence agents are needed for his defense along with the
contents of 40,000 other ages of classified documents.
   Walsh, accusing North of trying to provoke dismissal of the
charges by threatening to disclose the secrets, wants Gesell to bar
the former National Security Council aide from using any of the
material at trial.
   Gesell on Tuesday struck a wire-fraud allegation, one of the
three central charges against North, because he found it was ``a
purely cumulative count'' that would require a complicated and
confusing legal instruction to the jury.
   The dismissal suggests the wire-fraud charges against North's
co-defendants also may be dropped eventually. The co-defendants _
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers
Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord _ are
scheduled to be tried separately.
   The judge rejected North's arguments that the conspiracy and
embezzlement charges were legally flawed, saying: ``The indictment
clearly alleges a conspiracy which involved concealing the very
existence of the profits of the enterprise from the start and hiding
from Congress information relating to the conspirators' assistance
for the Contras.''
   Gesell also denied defense motions to dismiss six charges that
North lied to congressional committees in 1985 and 1986 by falsely
denying that he was covertly helping the rebels in violation of the
Boland Amendments.
   He said North's ``facial attack on the constitutionality of the
Boland Amendments is misplaced.'' The series of provisions, named
for Rep. Edward Boland, D-Mass., prohibited direct U.S. military aid
to the Contras.
   North's ``understanding as to the constitutionality of Boland in
no way affords an excuse for his alleged misconduct or entitled him
to obstruct the way the government was, in fact, functioning,''
Gesell said.
   Nor can North justify his conduct because of doubts expressed by
the Reagan administration that the Boland Amendments applied to
activities of the National Security Council staff, Gesell said.
   If prosecutors deliver on their promise to prove that President
Reagan ordered his White House staff to obey the Boland Amendments,
``North's alleged unauthorized deviation from such limitations must
be viewed as contrary to lawful government functions,'' he ruled.
   The judge also rejected the defense contention tht Congress
exceeded its powers in questioning the National Security Council
aide about his efforts to help the Contras.
   ``North did not refuse to answer congressional queries on the
grounds that Congress had no constitutional right to query National
Security Council officials,'' Gesell said. ``In fact, he is alleged
to have asserted his, and the NSC's, full compliance with the Boland
Amendment.''
   The judge also rejected a defense argument that the charges
infringe on the president's exclusive power to conduct diplomacy and
intelligence operations.
   In ruling on 34 of North's 37 pre-trial motions, Gesell has
upheld 14 of the 16 original charges against the retired Marine
lieutenant colonel. It appears unlikely that he will grant three
remaining defense motions to dismiss the charges North lied to
Congress on other legal grounds.
   Gesell, in a separate order, refused to bar Walsh and his
associates from today's hearing, saying that granting North's
request ``would alter the purpose of the hearing and result in
further and wholly unnecessary delay'' of the trial, which he
previously indicated may start in late January.

<HEAD>Two Of 17 Convicted Terrorists Finishing Prison Term Shortly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the 17 terrorists convicted in the 1983 car
bombings of the U.S. and French embassies are expected to be
released quietly when their prison terms end shortly, informed
sources said today.
   Officials at the Interior and Information ministries had no
comment.
   Members of the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad organization of Beirut
have demanded the release of the 17 from Kuwaiti jails in return for
the freedom of American and other foreign hostages held in Lebanon.
   The embassy bombings left five dead and 86 injured.
   The two terrorists the sources referred to were 25-year-old Iraqi
national Abdul-Mohsen Rashash Abbas and 30-year-old Nasser Matar
Dahash, whose family lives in Kuwait without official citizenship.
   In March 1984, the two were sentenced to five-year prison terms
with hard labor by the state security court after being found guilty
of possessing arms and explosives without a license. The sentence
also called for their deportation when the prison term ends.
   Other officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed
that the two were to be released after fulfilling their jail term.
They said that Kuwait does not want to discuss this publicly.
   The sentences were the most lenient meted out for the bombings.
   Three of the others who faced the more serious charges of
masterminding and carrying out the attacks were condemned to death,
although the executions have not been carried out. The rest were
given sentences ranging from life to 10-15 years hard labor.
   According to legal sources, the two will be deported to a country
of their choice once released. Their prison terms would be
calculated from the time of their arrest in December 1983, the
sources said.
   All the defendants were believed to be members of the underground
Islamic ``Al-Daawa party,'' a pro-Iranian group that was operating
underground in Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle
East.
   Nine Americans are among the 14 hostages believed held in
Lebanon. Peter Winkler, 32, a Swiss Red Cross employee, was abducted
by three unidentified gunmen Nov. 17. No group has claimed
responsibility for the kidnapping.
   The longest held foreign hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was abducted March
16, 1985.
   Kuwait has refused to bow to the demand to release the 17
terrorists, despite threats by Islamic Jihad and a series of other
terrorist acts that included a 1985 car bombing attack on the
motorcade of the Emir, Sheik Jaber Ahmed Sabah. The ruler escaped
with minor injuries.
   The hijackers of a Kuwaiti Airways plane in April also demanded
the release of the 17 terrorists, but Kuwait refused. The plane was
hijacked April 5. Two Kuwaiti passengers were killed in the 16-day
ordeal, which ended when the hijackers surrendered in Algeria and
were given safe conduct.
   Since August, when Iran and Iraq began a cease-fire in their
8-year-old war, ties between Iran and Kuwait have been improving.
Iran had accused Kuwait of aiding Iraq in the war.

<TEXT>
   The National Rifle Association and other
gun advocates spent nearly $6.6 million in an unsuccessful bid to
defeat Maryland's handgun control law, while the law's supporters
spent about $750,000, according to election reports.
   The NRA contributed $5.1 million to the campaign and loaned the
Maryland Committee Against the Gun Ban an additional $971,000, while
a little more than $100,000 came in the form of hundreds of small
contributions from donors in Maryland and other states, according to
reports released Tuesday.
   The Maryland committee, which has an empty treasury, has
outstanding debts of $375,000, not counting the NRA loan, the report
showed.
   Those who sought to repeal the law, which aims to outlaw cheap,
easily concealable handguns often called Saturday Night specials,
outspent supporters nearly 9-to-1, with their outlay representing
about $10 for every vote cast to defeat the law. The NRA said it was
the first time it has lost a state referendum on handgun control.
   The campaign was by far the most expensive in Maryland history.
   Citizens for Eliminating Saturday Night Specials, the committee
that backed the law, spent $752,107. It had support from most of the
state's elected officials, including Gov. William Donald Schaefer,
who helped raise money and made television and radio advertisements
supporting the law.
   Gun law advocates, who finished the campaign with a $17,000
surplus, spent more than $554,000 on advertising. The group raised
$372,000 in the final 2{ weeks of the campaign.
   The Washington-based group Handgun Control Inc. campaigned for
the law and provided the single largest contribution to its
defenders, $95,000. The group's vice chairman is Sarah Brady, wife
of presidential press secretary James Brady, who was shot along with
President Reagan in 1981.
   Final unofficial returns from election night showed the law won
by 57 percent to 43 percent.
   The law makes it illegal after Jan. 1, 1990, to sell handguns in
Maryland not approved by a nine-member board of gubernatorial
appointees. Guns made prior to 1985 are excluded from the ban.
   The law does not spell out which guns should be banned, but
directs the board to consider characteristics such as the quality of
materials and workmanship, concealability and the safety of the gun.

<TEXT>
   Former Mayor Jane Byrne, a lifelong Democrat,
might switch political parties to run for mayor, a newspaper
reported today.
   The Chicago Sun-Times, citing unnamed sources, said Byrne is
considering a run for mayor as a Republican. The sources said Byrne
has nominating petitions ready to go, and will announce her
candidacy shortly.
   In 1983, Byrne was denied renomination for mayor when she lost
the Democratic primary to Harold Washington, who later became the
city's first black mayor.
   ``I have no political comment,'' Byrne said Tuesday when asked if
she would become a Republican to run for mayor.
   The Sun-Times reported that Byrne, a former member of the
Democratic National Committee, discussed her possible mayoral
candidacy with Cook County Republican Chairman James E. Dvorak.
   ``I'd rather not comment on any of my discussions with potential
candidates at this time,'' Dvorak said.
   Republican officials said Byrne would likely win the party's
primary election against a lesser-known candidate.
   The filing period for the Feb. 28 primary is Dec. 12-19 for
regular party candidates. Nominating petitions for Republicans must
have 454 valid signatures. Democrats need 4,434 names.
   Six Democratic candidates have announced plans to run for mayor
to serve out the term of Washington, who died of a heart attack last
year. Cook County State's Attorney Richard Daley is expected to
announce his candidacy for the Democratic nomination Monday.
   Eugene Sawyer, who was selected by the City Council as acting
mayor, has not announced his candidacy.

   A court today found a U.S.-born immigrant guilty
of manslaughter in the shooting of a Palestinian shepherd near a
Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, Israeli radio said.
   It was the first time since the start of the Palestinian uprising
nearly a year ago that a Jewish settler was convicted of killing a
Palestinian. The defendant, Israel Zeev, claimed he fired in
self-defense.
   Leaders of the settlement movement, meanwhile, called on the army
to take harsher steps against Arab rioters, deporting those who
throw stones and barring anyone arrested for protesting from ever
holding a job in Israel.
   ``It seems to me we have a war going on here, but it is being
treated like a demonstration,'' said Haim Granit, a brigadier
general in the reserve army who lives in the West Bank settlement of
Elkana. ``The army must be given orders so they can handle this as
they should.''
   The 1.5 million Palestinians living in Israeli-occupied areas
have been rebelling against Israeli rule for almost a year. Since
the uprising began Dec. 8, 316 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have
been killed.
   Troops shot and wounded five Palestinians in stone-throwing
clashes in the occupied areas today, hospital officials said on
condition of anonymity.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   More than 150,000 Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip, most
living in refugee camps, were confined to their homes by military
curfews.
   The district court found Zeev guilty in the May 5 slaying of a
28-year-old Palestinian shepherd, Jude Abdallah Awad. Another
Palestinian was wounded in the eye when he came to Awad's aid. Zeev,
originally from Philadelphia, will be sentenced on Sunday, Israeli
radio said.
   The maximum sentence for manslaughter in Israel is 20 years.
   The incident began when a Jewish woman spotted several
Palestinian shepherds in a field between the West Bank village of
Turmus Aiya, 15 miles northeast of Jerusalem, and the nearby Jewish
settlement of Shillo.
   She called Zeev, who came and fired at the shepherds.
   In other developments, police released three Israelis suspected
of setting a fire that burned three Palestinians day laborers to
death as they slept in a shack near the Tel Aviv suburb of Or Yehuda
in August.
   The victims were all residents of the Gaza Strip.
   Police freed the suspects after holding them for 90 days. Israeli
radio said police did not have enough evidence to bring charges
against the men.

   A lawsuit filed on behalf of female high school
seniors accuses the state Education Department of sex discrimination
for using standardized test scores as the basis for awarding
scholarships.
   The class-action lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court,
challenges the state's decision to award 25,000 scholarships to the
1989 graduating class based solely on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
   ``The Education Department's exclusive use of SAT scores violates
due process because it is arbitrary and irrational, and violates
equal protection under the law because it discriminates against
women,'' said Robert Levy, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer.
   Between 1977 and 1987, state Regents and Empire scholarships were
awarded annually to students who scored high on the SAT, a national
standardized test taken by college-bound high school seniors.
   Because boys score an average of 60 points higher than girls,
boys won more state scholarships _ 72 percent of the Empire and 57
percent of the Regents awards.
   To remedy the discrepancy, the state decided to use grade-point
averages as well as SAT scores to award scholarships to the 1988
graduating class. The percentage of boys winning scholarships
dropped to 50 percent of Regents and 62 percent of Empire awards.
   But next year, the state wants to again use SAT scores only.
   Department spokesman Christopher Carpenter said the use of
grade-point averages was problematic.
   ``The diversity of school districts around the state makes it
virtually impossible to come up with a single grade system,''
Carpenter said.
   The $41 million scholarship program is the largest in the nation
based solely on performance rather than need.
   The lawsuit names as plaintiffs 10 female high school seniors,
the Girl's Club of America and the National Organization for Women.

   The author of a book about fraud and deception
within the Vatican's bank has been charged with bilking more than
$110,000 from the widow of the defense lawyer in a celebrated murder
case.
   FBI agents on Tuesday arrested Luigi M. DiFonzo, 41, and his
wife, Diane DiFonzo, 38, at their home in Kennebunk, Maine. DiFonzo
wrote ``St. Peter's Banker,'' about a Vatican banker who was
convicted and imprisoned for fraud, misappropriation of bank funds
and perjury in 1980.
   DiFonzo and his wife each were charged with five counts of
interstate transportation of fraudulently acquired money and one
count of wire fraud. DiFonzo also was charged with three counts of
mail fraud and Mrs. DiFonzo with one count of mail fraud.
   They were indicted Nov. 22 by a federal grand jury in St. Paul.
The indictment, unsealed Tuesday, charges that the couple swindled
Elizabeth Anderson of Granite Falls out of more than $110,000 _
virtually all of the estate of her late husband, Swen.
   DiFonzo was being held in lieu of $60,000 bail in a jail in
Portland, Maine. Mrs. DiFonzo was released on $60,000 bail.
   According to the FBI, DiFonzo met the Andersons during the 1984
trial of Steven Jenkins, who was sentenced to life in prison for the
ambush shooting of two bankers at a farm his father had once rented.
Swen Anderson, Mrs. Anderson's husband, defended Jenkins at the
trial.
   Anderson died of a heart attack in February 1986. In the next
three months, according to the indictment, DiFonzo persauded Mrs.
Anderson to make him her financial adviser.
   The couple is scheduled for an extradition hearing in Portland on
Friday.

   Thieves used automated teller machines to
steal nearly $350,000 from about 300 customers at California's
second-largest bank, officials said.
   Authorities are investigating whether special cards given to
employees of Security Pacific National Bank were used to gain access
to accounts, override the daily limit on cash withdrawals and take
cash without being detected.
   Security Pacific spokeswoman Deborah K. Lewis said the bank has
referred the case to authorities. An FBI agent confirmed his agency
is investigating.
   The bank reimbursed depositors after discovering the thefts,
which occurred Nov. 11-13, Ms. Lewis said. She declined to say how
many branches were hit.
   Security Pacific, the state's second-largest bank after Bank of
America, has new security procedures to prevent similar thefts, Ms.
Lewis said.

the devastation which terrorism can wreak on a country.''
   Shultz repeated his assertions that Arafat was an ``accessory''
to acts of terrorism by the Palestine Liberation Organization
against Americans and Israelis. At the same time, Shultz rejected a
British reporter's suggestion the ``interational row'' raised by the
decision could be a ``blot'' on his last days as Secretary of State.
   ``I operated within the framework of a law here.'' Shultz
replied. ``If the thing I am remembered for is most of all a strong
and a great resolve to resist and combat terrorism, I won't feel
that's a blot on my record. I'll feel that is a proud
accomplishment.''
   The General Assembly's legal committee voted 121-2 Tuesday night
to ask the State Department to grant Arafat a U.S. visa. Only the
United States and Israel were opposed.
   That was an indication of how lopsided the vote was likely to be
today when the 159-member General Assembly takes up an
Arab-sponsored resolution deploring Shultz's decision.
   Asked if he would reverse himself, Shultz replied: ``No.''
   The subject dominated an interview he gave over the U.S.
Information Agency's ``Worldnet'' program to reporters in Western
Europe. They asked more questions about Arafat's visa than the
suggested topic, the meeting Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
have in New York next Wednesday with President Reagan and
President-elect George Bush.
   While defending the decision, Shultz stressed that Palestinian
Arabs had a central role to play in Mideast peace efforts. ``We want
to see a good dialogue with the Palestinians,'' Shultz said.
   He recalled his efforts to meet with Palestinians in Jerusalem
during trips to the region this year. All those invited, following
PLO instructions, did not show up.
   Shultz said the Palestine National Council, the legislative arm
of the PLO, had taken some ``significant'' steps during its recent
meeting in Algiers. But, he said, the PLO should go further and
recognize Israel's right to exist.
   ``If they can do it implicitly, why can't they do it
explicitly?'' Shultz asked.

   Two inmates used makeshift hang
gliders in a daring escape attempt from a Mexican prison, but they
crashed before getting off prison grounds, an official said.
   Inmate Juan De Dios Gonzalez plunged to the roof of the workshop
at La Loma Prison on Monday and was hospitalized in critical
condition with head and internal injuries, said Arturo Aguilar,
prison director.
   The men had climbed to the roof of the three-story prison and
assembled hang gliders made from pieces of cloth, wood and plastic,
Aguilar said.
   Gonzalez, serving a seven-year sentence for drug possession, and
inmate Jose Contreras took a running start and jumped off the roof,
officials said.
   Contreras, awaiting trial on theft charges, hit a wire fence and
fell 30 feet to the ground. He was hospitalized in fair condition
with broken ribs and a broken leg.
   A third inmate was captured as he clutched his hang glider on the
compound's roof, Aguilar said.

   The Journal-Bulletin, Providence, R.I., on the stealth bomber:
   The stealth bomber has yet to fly. If forthcoming tests are
successful, however, there is no good reason not to add it to the
arsenal. ...
   Many factors ... will make the stealth bomber particularly
expensive _ possibly $500 million per jet. The Defense Department
wants 132 of them.
   Yes, the price is rather steep, and, yes, opponents are already
lining up against the stealth, hoping to shoot it down for costing
too much. ...
   We believe that Congress and the White House can disagree
reasonably on how many stealth bombers need to be built, and how
quickly they must be deployed.
   But stealth has received bipartisan support in the past; it
deserves bipartisan support in the years to come.

   Farmington (N.M.) Daily Times on Bush's promise not to raise
taxes:
   All kinds of experts are trying to convince the American people
that President-elect George Bush won't be able to keep his campaign
promise to reduce the federal budget deficit without increasing
taxes.
   Republicans and Democrats alike in the nation's capital are
joining the Big Spenders Chorus that keeps singing the old song
proclaiming deficit reductions cannot be achieved with federal
spending cuts alone.
   To Bush's credit, he takes the position that revenues already are
adequate enough to fund necessary federal programs.
   The key words, of course, are ``necessary federal programs.''
   After Bush is inaugurated Jan. 20, we urge him to stick to his
campaign promise.
   The people should demand that the U.S. Senate and House of
Representatives toe the mark when it comes to reducing the budget
deficit and holding the line on taxes.

   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, on conservative leaders:
   A powerful force has emerged in the Atlantic alliance, a
conservative axis linking the United States, Great Britain and
Canada.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, re-elected Nov. 21, is the first
Canadian prime minister in this century to win consecutive majority
terms.
   In Great Britain, Margaret Thatcher is in the second year of her
historic third term, and in this country George Bush's victory on
the heels of two Ronald Reagan terms marks the fifth win in six
campaigns for the conservative presidential candidates.
   This consistency of politically compatible leadership in these
three nations _ nations intimately related by history, culture,
language, democratic forms of government and free-market economies _
has emerged as a new and potent force.
   A tide of history is flowing, a conservative surge that has
allowed a coherence of policy over time among the three principal
North Atlantic nations, a coherence unknown since the grand alliance
of World War II.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on Canada's election:
   The Canadians have just run an exciting, issue-centered campaign
that drew more than 75 percent of the eligible voters to the polls.
   The two top contenders faced off in a no-holds-barred,
spontaneous and highly enlightening debate on the trade agreement.
   Our own lackluster, image-oriented, sound bite style campaign
looks shallow and concocted in comparison _ and it drew a far
smaller percentage of votes.
   Perhaps central to the high level of interest across Canada was
that the campaign lasted only 51 days.
   American presidental contests get longer and longer, distorting
government processes for months, and boring the voters silly.
   From the evidence of this campaign, Canadians do it better.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on the Iran-Contra trials:
   The criminal justice system _ not politics _ should determine the
fate of Lt. Col. Oliver North and others who may soon be going to
trial over their role in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Conservative leaders see the impending trial less as a legitimate
judicial exercise than a political showdown between the executive
and legislative branches of government. ...
   Wrong. It is nothing less than a reaffirmation of the principle
that no one, no matter how highly placed, is above the law. ...
   Since the trial isn't scheduled to get under way until after
Reagan has left the Oval Office, it looks as though a presidential
pardon isn't in the cards _ not for this president, anyway.
   The question to be answered now is not whether North served the
political aims of the White House well or poorly during the
Iran-Contra affair, but whether he broke laws in the process.
   And that _ as the president himself admits _ is best determined
in the courts.

   San Antonio Express-News on worthwhile tasks for Dan Quayle:
   One of the biggest problems every vice president faces is simply
finding something worthwhile to do.
   Britain's Prince Charles faces a similar dilemma. The heir
apparent to the throne recently celebrated his 40th birthday. Since
his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is only 62, currently in good
health, and not particularly inclined to abdicate, Charles may have
to wait a decade or two to become king.
   While he is waiting, the prince _ who is a year younger than Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle _ has found some meaningful and
worthwhile work to occupy his time.
   Charles regularly visits inner-city slums, schools and factories.
He organized Project Fullemploy to prepare young, urban blacks for
jobs, persuaded some London companies to offer jobs to people who
have dropped out of school, and plays an active role in helping the
poor gain title to their own homes through ``sweat equity.''
   If Bush means what he says, and if Quayle runs out of meaningful
work to do, Bush might suggest that his vice president look to
Charles' example. It should be an eye-opening experience for Quayle,
who is a son of wealth and privilege, and it might do some good for
the country.

   Former President Jimmy Carter ... deserves credit for being on
target when it came to the B-1B bomber program. ...
   (Recently) ...a B-1B bomber crashed and burned while trying to
land. ...
   The crash came two days after the Air Force said it had cleared
63 of the nation's 98 B-1B bombers to return to service. The entire
fleet had been grounded since Nov. 8 when a B-1B crashed and burned
at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas.
   The B-1B was ... intended to modernize the long-range bomber
fleet until the recently unveiled B-2 Stealth bomber could become
fully operational. ...
   Critics say the bomber cannot fulfill its assigned mission of
flying deep into Soviet territory with a payload of nuclear bombs.
They say it is too slow, it consumes too much fuel ... and it is too
heavy for pilots to handle safely.
   Today the nation is paying _ and paying _ for (President)
Reagan's decision to overrule Carter's veto of funds for the B-1B

   Los Angeles Times on the thaw in Sino-Soviet relations:
   The world may be about to witness the sort of fundamental
strategic realignment that happens only once or twice in a
generation.
   Without fanfare, relations between the Soviet Union and China
have warmed to the point where the world's two great communist
powers are ready to undertake their first high-level exchanges in
decades.
   If Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's trip this week to
Moscow turns out as well as expected, it will lay the groundwork for
a historic summit (in 1989) between Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Deng Ziaoping, China's senior statesman, ... the first
since Nikita S. Khrushchev traveled to Beijing in 1959. ...
   As relations between Moscow and Washington have warmed, the
Chinese have felt left out of deliberations over intermediate
nuclear missiles and other matters important to them. ...
   U.S. strategists believe that reduced tensions between China and
the Soviet Union may eventually make the whole region more secure.
But the Sino-Soviet split has been such a fixture for so long that,
once it disappears, other readjustments may be in store.

   The Capital Times, Madison, Wis., on delinquent farm loans:
   Imagine if your holiday mail included a 200-page packet from the
federal government with this grim choice _ fill out this material or
lose your farm. ...
   The Farmers Home Administration sent out the packets the week
after the election to farmers who were delinquent on their loans.
   It took the FmHA five months to put together all this material in
response to a 1987 law. Now it wants farmers to respond in 45 days _
45 days that coincide with the holiday season.
   While the cold and calculating may say that those who can't hack
it ought to get off the farm, that attitude ignores both the
vagaries of the farm economy and the wider threat to rural America
in the steady demise of small farms.
   It also ignores the human pain involved when the farmer not only
loses a job, but a home and land often passed on from generation to
generation.
   A group of 14 members of Congress ... is seeking to extend the
45-day response period so that beleaguered farmers at least have
more time to search out their options under the new federal rules.
   The extra time could help some farmers cope with the complexity
of the law and perhaps could give them a chance to survive
economically through 1989.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on President Reagan's veto of the
ethics bill:
   Maybe President Reagan didn't like the nickname of the ethics
bill he killed (last) week with a pocket veto.
   It was informally called the ``Never Again Mike Deaver'' bill,
taking on the name of Reagan's former aide and close friend who was
convicted of illegal influence peddling (lobbying) after he left the
White House.
   Whatever his reason, Reagan refused to sign the bill that would
have imposed tougher curbs on lobbying by both former administration
officials and _ for the first time _ imposed the same restrictions
on former members of Congress.
   The Reagan administration has a dismal record when it comes to
conflicts of interest, and this would have been one final
opportunity for the president to say: ``Enough. It stops here.''
Instead, he said, ``Business as usual.''

Arafat:
   Secretary of State (George) Shultz's decision to deny a visa to
the Palestine Liberation Organization's Yasser Arafat to visit
United Nations has raised the hackles of many Arab leaders.
   But it also sends a useful message concerning the United States'
resolve to combat terrorism.
   Shultz has done the right thing, in our opinion, by underscoring
his and the nation's policy of repelling terrorists and those who
abet their aims.
   Organizations which take part in or foster acts of terrorism are
simply going to have to do more for peace and cooperation before
they reach the U.N. bargaining table.

   The Wenatchee (Wash.) World on the English-only movement:
   It is time to put the brakes on the English-only bandwagon. A new
idea branded ``English-plus'' has a lot more to recommend it.
   Concern about this issue arises because three more states ...
passed English-only amendments to their state constitutions earlier
this month during the big national election. They joined 13 other
states that had already passed English-only laws of their own. ...
   While much of the nation has perceived these laws as relatively
harmless in the past, ... there is a growing sense that there's more
to this legislation than just promoting English.
   Racist comments are surfacing which make it clear some backers of
English-only laws are more worried about keeping certain segments of
the population down than they are about lifting language skills up.
...
   In response to this negative approach taken by English-only
groups, opponents have coined the new slogan ``English-plus'' to
demonstrate their commitment to teaching English while preserving
minority languages.
   We should even go beyond that by encouraging more Americans to
learn other languages, especially Japanese, Chinese and Spanish, to
deal most effectively with the entire Pacific Rim over the next few
decades.

   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle said today he
would make no recommendation to his homestate governor on whom to
appoint to his Senate seat, although he did not turn aside
suggestions that he favors Rep. Dan Coats for the post.
   Quayle, in an interview with The Associated Press, also said he
was intentionally moving slowly on major staffing decisions during
this transition period, in contrast to President-elect George Bush,
who is rapidly picking top aides.
   ``To rush right into it, I think I could in fact be regretting it
down the road. I've got time. There's no time pressure on me. I've
got to be ready by Jan. 20,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle, who was meeting later today with Indiana Gov. Robert D.
Orr, said he hopes Orr will make the Senate appointment ``relatively
soon.'' He said he had not made a specific recommendation, ``nor
will I.''
   But asked about Coats, Quayle did not reject a reporter's
suggestion that the Indiana Republican was his personal choice.
Coats represents the congressional district that Quayle represented
from 1976 to 1980, and he was Quayle's district representative in
Fort Wayne, Ind., during that period.
   ``Obviously, I think a lot of Dan Coats. He worked for me for
four years. He's been a very good congressman from my old
congressional district. He took my seat. We've had a long and strong
personal and professional relationship,'' Quayle said.
   He has said he will resign effective Jan. 2 to allow his
appointed successor seniority over other incoming senators. Orr's
office has said the Republican governor is expected to wait at least
two weeks before making a selection.
   The turtle-like pace of Quayle's transition, aides say, reflects
that a politician moving from the legislative to the executive
branch of government inevitably needs some educating.
   Moreover, the vice president-elect apparently is in no hurry to
make appointments without Bush's acquiescence.
   ``He's not going to rush it,'' said Dan Evans, the head of
Quayle's transition team whose friendship with the Indiana senator
goes back nearly 20 years.
   Quayle's transition team operates from a white, federal-style
town house off Pennsylvania Avenue near the Old Executive Office
Building where Quayle eventually will work as vice president.
   The town house customarily is set aside for the use of former
presidents, and the walls are adorned with photographs of Gerald
Ford, Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon. The quarters are elegant, if
cramped, with barely enough room for Secret Service agents posted in
the narrow hallways. Press aides on the second floor must move to
the lobby if the senator wishes to use the conference room that
serves as their makeshift office.
   Those drawbacks aside, Evans says Quayle's transition is moving
ahead as it should and Quayle is selecting his staff ``in
consultation with President-elect Bush and his staff.''
   ``He isn't waiting for approval or disapproval, but in keeping
with the collegiality of the decision-making process, decisions will
not be made in a vacuum,'' Evans said in a recent interview.
   Bush moved quickly to pick his chief of staff, John Sununu, and
many of his top Cabinet officials. An announcement on Quayle's chief
of staff, who will head a team of roughly 100 people, is expected in
early December.
   Evans himself is said not to be in the running, nor are any of
the top ``handlers'' that traveled with Quayle during the campaign.
Many of them, veterans of previous White House jobs, have said they
now prefer private life. Evans won't say whether Quayle is looking
for a Washington insider, Indiana crony or someone from his Senate
staff.
   Dozens of ``high quality resumes'' and hundreds of unsolicited
resumes have come into the transition office, Evans says, but Quayle
is ``educating himself on the executive branch before he makes his
staffing decisions.''
   And although Quayle's staff organization will be patterned after
Bush's vice presidential office, there is one top adviser who
doesn't appear on any official flow chart. That is Marilyn Quayle,
the senator's wife, who occupies an office in the transition
building and who probably will have space in the vice presidential
office as well.
   ``There is no adviser senior to her,'' Evans says.
   Quayle's work day usually begins shortly after 7 a.m. when he
arrives to prepare for breakfast meetings. It ends 12 or 13 hours
later after more meetings, perusal of briefing papers and an
occasional black-tie dinner.
   His meetings have read like a roster of the conservative elite:
Heritage Foundation president Ed Feulner; outgoing Rep. Jack Kemp,
R-N.Y.; conservative columnists George Will, William F. Buckley Jr.
and William Safire; former United Nations ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick and Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress Foundation.
   Evans rejects the notion that Quayle is being used by the right
to further its agenda for the incoming administration. The
conservatives, he says, were simply ``the first ones to call.''
   ``Dan Quayle is a conservative, but he is the instrument of no
particular group,'' Evans says.

   A U.N. committee overwhelmingly denounced
the U.S. refusal to let Yasser Arafat into the country and urged a
reversal of the decision in a harsh resolution sent to the General
Assembly today.
   The 121-2 vote Tuesday evening by the assembly's legal committee
indicated how lopsided the vote in the full assembly is likely to be.
   The United States and Israel opposed the resolution, which
recommended the State Department issue a visa to the Palestine
Liberation Organization leader so he can address the General
Assembly on the Palestinian issue.
   Arafat, in Sudan for talks on the Middle East situation, was
quoted as calling the U.S. decision not to grant him a visa
``illegal.''
   In Kuwait, the No. 2 man in Arafat's Fatah PLO faction called on
Arab states to withdraw their U.S. ambassadors for the remaining
weeks of the Reagan administration to protest the U.S. decision.
   ``Withdrawing the Arab ambassadors from Washington for 45 days
will be the simplest expression of a pan-Arab reaction against the
rudeness of the United States and its secretary of state George
Shultz,'' said Salah Khalaf, addressing a rally Tuesday night.
   Britain abstained from Tuesday's U.N. vote because it opposed
strong language in the resolution. European nations joined the Arab
and non-aligned countries in supporting the measure.
   The legal committee, formally called the Sixth Committee, has
delegates from all 159 member nations, but not all were present for
the vote.
   The PLO's permanent observer at the United Nations, Zuhdi Labib
Terzi, said Arab nations would offer another resolution to move the
General Assembly to Geneva if the first resolution passed.
   It would be the first time the General Assembly has shifted its
session in protest, although special sessions have been held in
Geneva.
   Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League ambassador, said he had enough
votes to reconvene the General Assembly in Geneva.
   Francois Giuliani, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, said no figures were available on the cost of the
move, but other U.N. sources said it would be relatively modest. One
source suggested it could be about $150,000.
   That would cover the cost of flying a few New York U.N. personnel
to Geneva, site of the headquarters of the defunct League of
Nations. It has facilities for sessions of the 159-nation assembly.
   Most nations were expected to assign their Geneva ambassadors to
the session, diplomats said.
   The General Assembly on Tuesday delayed its annual debate on the
Palestinian problem, originally scheduled Thursday, Friday and Dec.
6, to allow arrangements for Arafat to speak elsewhere.
   On Saturday, the State Department rejected Arafat's application
for a visa to address the General Assembly this week, saying he
condones and encourages terrorism. That set off an international
uproar and demands that Arafat be allowed to speak.
   Under the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement, the United
States pledges not to impede the travel or work of U.N. diplomats or
guests. The PLO holds nonvoting observer status at the United
Nations and is an honored invitee.
   It is considered the sole, legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people and is invited to speak in all debates on the
Palestinian issue and the Middle East.
   Behind-the-scenes negotiations sponsored by the British failed to
remove the caustic language from the resolution, which said the
United States was in ``violation'' of the host country agreement.
The committee said it ``deplores'' the refusal to grant Arafat a

   British Ambassador Sir Crispin Tickell said his delegation
supported Arafat's right to speak and said the United States should
have shown respect for the United Nations by honoring the host
country agreement.
   But Tickell said the committee should have respected the United
States by removing the harsh language from the resolution. The Arab
sponsors refused.

   Ammonia gas spread through a four-story
industrial building today, injuring four workers and forcing the
evacuation of 200 others, a fire official said.
   Three of the injured workers were taken to St. James Hospital of
Newark where they were treated for ammonia inhalation and nausea.
They were released after treatment, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Chemicals used by Plating City Corp. caused the problem, said
Larry Krieger, fire department spokesman.
   ``Before closing yesterday, workers at the plating company added
ammonia to a plating solution and left it overnight,'' Krieger said.
``It's a routine operation, but because of the cold weather the
windows were closed and the fumes built up and seeped into the upper
floors.''
   Carbel Fashions and FCP Fashions occupy the floors above the
plating company and when employees arrived at work, several
complained of headaches.
   After four workers became ill, the fire department ordered about
200 people from the building, Krieger said.

   Eleven people were killed in clashes between
Armenians and Azerbaijanis in ethnic violence in at least five
cities in Armenia, official sources said today.
   The deaths reported by the official Armenian news agency
Armenpress on the basis of official government information raised
the death toll in more than a week of ethnic violence to at least 18.
   Leon Azruyan, an editor at the news agency, said in a telephone
interview that the 11 dead included 10 Azerbaijanis and one
Armenian. The figure included clashes in cities throughout Armenia
that occurred Nov. 22-29, but only were reported officially today,
he said.
   The Armenian was killed in the city of Goris in southeastern
Armenia by Azerbaijanis who fired into a crowd of Armenians holding
a rally, Azruyan said. Two people were seriously wounded, and the
attackers slipped away, he said.
   In the city of Kalinino in far northern Armenia, an Azerbaijani
fired into a crowd of Armenians, ``but they threw stones at him. One
hit him in the head and killed him,'' Azruyan said.
   He said the other deaths occurred in the cities of Kirovakan,
Krasnoselsk and Spitak in northern Armenia but that there was no
detailed information on how many died in each city or what the
circumstances were.
   The previous seven deaths officially reported all occurred in the
Azerbaijani city of Kirovabad.
   Four soldiers were killed protecting the Armenian population from
crowds of Azerbaijanis, and three civilians were shot and killed
there by soldiers for violating curfew regulations.
   Military law and a strict curfew have been imposed in the
Armenian capital Yerevan, the Azerbaijani capital Baku and cities
around both republics.
   Baku and Yerevan were reported by official and activist sources
to be relatively quiet today.
   Trouble began in the Caucasus republics in February when the
predominantly Armenian population of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of
Azerbaijan began agitating for annexation by Armenia.
   Azerbaijan and the central Soviet government have rejected
annexation.
   Mass demonstrations followed in Armenia, and at the end of the
month ethnic rioting broke out in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait,
killing at least 32 people.
   The latest unrest began in mid-November. Azerbaijanis accused
Armenia of sending settlers into Nagorno-Karabakh to increase the
Armenian majority there, forcing Azerbaijanis out of work and
refusing them food and medical supplies.
   On Tuesday, the president of Azerbaijan, Suleiman Tatlev, blamed
Armenians for starting the latest outbreak of violence.
   Tatlev said violence began when Armenians sacked and burned
Azerbaijani homes in Nagorno-Karabakh and instigated mass firings of
the Azerbaijani minority about a month ago.
   He told reporters at Tuesday's meeting of the Supreme Soviet
national parliament that about 4,000 Azerbaijanis fled to Baku and
officials found the leadership of Nagorno-Karabakh unwilling to
solve the problem.

<HEAD>Blood Tests Show Lead At Port Not An Immediate Health Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blood tests given residents of the
mining port of Skagway, where soil with among the nation's highest
lead contaminations was found, indicate there is no immediate health
threat, state officials say.
   But the state Department of Environmental Conservation said
Tuesday it will require cleanup of the contaminated soil to make
sure there are no problems in the future.
   Dick Stokes, the agency's regional supervisor, called the results
encouraging.
   But, he added, ``Regardless of the blood results so far, there
still is a lot of lead and zinc in the soil. We're very lucky that
no more has been ingested than it has, but it's still there and we
still think cleanup is going to be necessary.''
   For decades, trucks and trains carrying ore from lead and zinc
mines have rumbled into Skagway, a town of 700 people north of
Juneau in the Alaska Panhandle. Most recently, the huge mine at Faro
in Canada's Yukon Territory has been moving ore trucks through
Skagway every half-hour, 24 hours a day, 362 days a year.
   Lead contamination in soil at the ore-loading terminal on the
edge of town reached about 57,000 parts per million, making it one
of the worst known sites of lead contamination in the nation, state
environmental officials have said.
   In town, lead was tested at about 28,000 ppm at one site and
about 20,000 ppm at another. The federal government generally
requires cleanup of sites with more than 1,000 ppm of lead.
   Lead poisoning can cause high blood pressure and neurological
problems. Children and pregnant women are particularly susceptible
to health damage.
   The state offered voluntary blood and urine tests to the town's
residents. The report released Tuesday said that of the 161 blood
samples and 40 urine samples taken, only five showed lead levels
greater than normal.
   The report said those five were from people who worked at the
ore-loading terminal, and that they already undergo regular
monitoring for lead levels.
   It also said there was no need for additional tests or routine
monitoring of Skagway visitors or residents, other than those who
work at the terminal.
   Environmentalists said such one-time blood tests are not
definitive.
   ``I'm glad that most of the results aren't high enough that
immediate intervention is required, but I don't think it's
appropriate for the health department to say no further tests are
warranted,'' said Kristine Benson of the Alaska Center for the
Environment.

   A young man who blamed his life of
crime on his name _ Adolph Hitler Clark _ has pleaded guilty to a
charge of third-degree murder and also learned his middle name is
Hilbert.
   Clark, 18, pleaded guilty Tuesday in the slaying of a man who was
trying to buy cocaine. He faces up to 12 years in prison.
   Meanwhile, Chief Assistant Public Defender Bill White presented
Circuit Judge John D. Southwood with a copy of Clark's birth
certificate showing the young man's middle name is actually Hilbert
and not Hitler.
   Clark said in an interview last year that he used his middle name
as an excuse for his criminal activity.
   ``After I learned who Hitler really was, I decided people
expected me to live up to his name,'' he said.
   His father, Theodore Clark, said he named his son Adolph after
the boy's uncle and thought Hitler would be a good middle name.
   After seeing the document, Southwood ordered the criminal
information changed to reflect Clark's correct name.
   White said after the hearing that the combination of the
mispronunciation of Hilbert and the familiarity of the Nazi leader's
name apparently led to Clark being called Adolph Hitler Clark.
   Clark pleaded guilty to being one of two gunmen who shot Terry
Lamar Combs, 35, on Aug. 2 as the man was negotiating to buy cocaine.
   Prosecutors dropped a second-degree murder charge against Clark
on the condition that he plead guilty to the lesser offense and
testify against co-defendant Anthony Michael Cobb, 18.

   Mice prone to developing a blood cell cancer
gained partial protection from a human gene that influences blood
cell development, suggesting that developmental genes may affect
vulnerability to cancer, researchers say.
   Such genes may make a difference in how long normal cells remain
susceptible to turning malignant, they said.
   The work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British journal
Nature by Philip Leder, Michel Nussenzweig and Emmett Schmidt of
Harvard Medical School with colleagues there and at the Childrens
Hospital of Los Angeles.
   They worked with mice that carried a human c-myc gene, which puts
them at high risk for developing a blood cell cancer called pre-B
cell lymphoma. Pre-B cells are those that will develop as B cells,
an important part of the body's disease-fighting immune system.
   Those mice were bred with others that carried a different human
gene, one that makes B cells skip an early stage in their
development.
   Some progeny from these matings inherited both human genes, and
their lymphoma rates were compared to those that carried only the
cancer-causing gene. Results showed that the gene that speeds
development caused both a delay and a reduction in the tumors,
researchers said.
   By 117 days of age, half the mice that carried only the
cancer-causing gene had developed lymphoma, but none of the mice
with both genes had developed it. After a year, more than 90 percent
of the first group had developed tumors, compared to only 40 percent
of the mice with both human genes.
   The developmental gene apparently hampered development of cancer
by speeding up the maturation of pre-B cells, leaving fewer at
stages most susceptible to the cancer-causing gene, researchers
suggested.
   In general, a diverse group of genes that produce either an
acceleration or pause in cell development may influence the rates
and time of onset for cancer, researchers said.

<DATELINE>BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The carcasses of 48 of the endangered
Kemp's ridley turtles have washed ashore in south Georgia and north
Florida this fall.
   ``This is pretty much a crisis,'' said Charles Maley of the
Georgia Department of Natural Resources. ``This is the most we've
ever had in a year.''
   Ten Kemp's ridley turtles turned up dead on Georgia beaches in
October and 11 have been reported so far in November, Maley said.
   In Florida, 27 carcasses have been found on Amelia Island, the
northernmost island on the state's east coast, since Oct. 28,
according to Jan Johnson, Florida-based coordinator for the national
sea turtle campaign of the environmental group Greenpeace.
   ``We usually find one or two in fall months,'' Ms. Johnson said.
   According to Ms. Johnson, Kemp's ridleys are considered the
rarest and most endangered of all sea turtles. They are also one of
the smaller species, with the females' shells averaging about 30
inches long, she said. Only 400 to 600 nesting females are believed
to exist worldwide.
   Ms. Johnson said she believes the Kemp's ridleys, which migrate
south to a nesting beach at Rancho Nuevo, Mexico, fell victim to
commercial shrimp boats. Shrimpers sometimes accidentally catch sea
turtles in their nets and drown them.
   But Duncan Amos, director of the University of Georgia's Marine
Extension Center in Brunswick, said sea turtles also fall prey to
cold water, pollution, shark attacks, boat propellers and dredging.

<TEXT>
   The Florida Supreme Court today rejected
Democratic U.S. Rep. Bill Chappell's lawsuit seeking to reverse his
failed re-election bid by throwing out ballots cast by nearly 11,000
voters.
   The high court, facing a self-imposed noon deadline before the
state's Elections Canvassing Commission could certify Republican
newcomer Craig James as the winner, issued its ruling in a brief
order shortly after 8 a.m. It planned to issue an opinion explaining
its reasoning later.
   The commission had been scheduled Monday to tell federal
elections officials that James, a DeLand lawyer, had won the 4th
Congressional District race, but the court delayed the meeting for
two days because of Chappell's lawsuit.
   A veteran of 20 years in Congress, Chappell lost to James by 732
votes in a recount of the Nov. 8 general election.
   Messages were left for Chappell today, but the telephone calls
were not immediately returned.
   ``We are delighted we had a victory for the people of the 4th
District,'' James said, adding that he had 11 lawyers research the
law. ``To attempt to disenfranchise the voters of the 4th District
is tantamount to being un-American.''
   James said in a telephone interview from Washington that he hopes
Chappell will concede and help ``with an easy transition.''
   Chappell's lawsuit sought to have Flagler County's election
results invalidated, claiming the county elections supervisor's
office missed a seven-day deadline after the election to file
returns with state officials.
   State law requires that returns be ignored if they arrive after 5
p.m. on the seventh day after an election, but the canvassing
commission said it would be unjust to disqualify voters because of a
technicality.
   Without the county's 10,907 votes, Chappell would have won by 288
votes.

<TEXT>
   Insurance companies and agricultural
cooperatives should be subject to the same antitrust laws as other
businesses, the head of the Federal Trade Commission said Wednesday.
   ``There is no good reason to continue the antitrust exemption for
agricultural cooperatives,'' Daniel Oliver told reporters at one of
his occasional briefings for the media.
   ``They are huge agribusinesses now, and whatever reason there was
for having an exemption 50 years ago, when perhaps they were smaller
... those reasons don't seem to exist today,'' he said.
   Repeating a call he has made often, he said he hoped Congress,
which moved toward ending the insurance industry exemption this
year, will complete action next year.
   Discussing directions that should be taken by the new
administration, Oliver also suggested a review of ``the unfair
competition faced by for-profit firms from the commercial arms of
not-for-profit entities.''
   Asked for an example, he cited pharmacies operated by hospitals
competing with privately owned pharmacies.
   ``Why should not all commercial enterprises be subject to the
same antitrust, tax and other legal obligations?'' Oliver said.
   Oliver's term as chairman of the agency, which supervises the
antitrust laws jointly with the Justice Department, has expired.
However, he remains in office until a successor is named or he is
reappointed. He has said he is available to retain the post, should
President-elect George Bush want him to do so.

   Agricultural workers who are in the country illegally have until
midnight to apply for immigration amnesty, a deadline that is
passing quietly and is tainted with charges of fraud.
   Federal immigration offices around the country braced for a
last-minute rush as the last call is made for the illegal aliens'
applications for U.S. residency.
   Under a special provision of the 1986 immigration law, foreign
farmhands must prove they harvested fruits, vegetables or other
perishable crops in the United States for at least 90 days in a
one-year period that ended May 1, 1986, to be eligible.
   More than half of the applications filed for the Special
Agricultural Workers Program have come from California, followed by
Florida with about 10 percent and Texas with about 8 percent.
Significant numbers have also been filed in the Northwest, Arizona
and New York.
   Under the initial phase of the legalization program that ended
May 4, temporary residency was granted to more than 1.7 million
illegal aliens who proved continuous residency in the United States
since Jan. 1, 1982.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service had estimated that
600,000 farm workers would apply for the latest program. The figure
topped 1 million by the first week of November, and up to 200,000
more are expected before the filing period ends, said Aaron Bodin,
who heads the program in Washington, D.C.
   But in a last, desperate chance to become legal U.S. residents,
many farmworkers are using fraudulent documents to prove they worked
here to qualify.
   Many farmhands unable to obtain the needed documents turn to
labor contractors who hire illegal immigrants. For a fee, many of
these contractors provide the documentation, Bodin said.
   Mary Lopez, the California-based director of the Martin Luther
King Jr. Farmworkers' Fund, said she's heard of people paying up to
$800 for a phony letter.
   In Denver, Donald H. Russell, INS district director, said more
than 20 percent of the documents filed by the over 17,000 applicants
in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah were fraudulent.
   ``But we haven't reviewed a lot yet,'' Russell said. ``We expect
it will go higher.''
   In the Western states in recent weeks, 70 percent of applications
filed have been recommended for denial, officials said.
   Although it appears many will ultimately be approved, immigration
officials say the final denial rate may be as high as 50 percent.
   In the Northeast, more than 40 percent of the almost 20,000
applications were fraudulent, said Amy Otten, an INS spokeswoman in
Burlington, Vt.
   ``Fraud was high throughout the Eastern region, especially in
larger metropolitan areas,'' Ms. Otten said.
   The deadline comes without the fanfare the one in May. During the
last month of that yearlong application period, the INS, as well as
private groups, put out the word on radio, television, billboards,
newspapers and pamphlets.
   But even as the agricultural program ends quietly, lines outside
INS centers have lengthened in the past week or so, officials say.
   ``Today was the longest line we've had since May 4,'' Henry
McGehee, legalization center director in El Paso, Texas, said
Tuesday. ``But it wasn't nearly as long as the ones we had then.''
   Longer lines have been reported in the Lower Rio Grande Valley,
where there are more farms and farmworkers.
   In Phoenix, officials said more than 52,000 farm workers were
expected to apply by the deadline.
   ``The number has greatly exceeded what we anticipated at the
beginning of the program,'' said Richard Perry, deputy director of
the Phoenix INS district.
   Farm workers queued up early today at the INS office in
Albuquerque, N.M. But Betty Garcia, the office's acting supervisor,
said the scene was not hectic.
   ``It's nothing like the May 4 close of general amnesty,'' Garcia
said.
   She said more than 4,000 people had applied at her office for
amnesty under the agricultural program.
   New Jersey immigration officials also expected to tally large
numbers of applicants today.
   ``It's kind of like April 15 with taxes,'' said Jack Lonergan,
INS assistant district director for exams. ``Lots of people will
wait until the last minute.''
   In Florida, applications jumped from 200 a day to as many as
1,200 in the last few weeks, the INS said.
   ``It's really increased in the past week,'' said Perry Rivkind,
district director. ``One day last week we had 1,200 in Tampa alone.''

   A powerful aftershock today shook remote southwest
China and collapsed buildings damaged in an earlier earthquake that
killed 730 people.
   The official Xinhua News Agency quoted local officials as saying
an unspecified number of people were injured by the aftershock,
which registered 6.7 on the Richter scale. It did not mention any
deaths but said communications lines were cut.
   On Nov. 6, an earthquake in the region, China's worst in more
than a decade, injured more than 4,000 people. It measured 7.6 on
the Richter scale, making it nearly 10 times more powerful than the
aftershock.
   Xinhua said the aftershock hit the Lancang area of Yunnan
province near China's border with Burma. The news agency said one
person was injured on Sunday when an aftershock of 5.9 hit the same
place.
   Li Muxun of the State Seismology Bureau in Beijing said some
buildings damaged in the Nov. 6 quake collapsed after today's
aftershock.
   Since Nov. 6, there have been more than 1,000 aftershocks.
   No one answered telephones at Yunnan provincial government
offices.
   The area contains mountainous, heavily forested terrain that has
slowed rescue efforts and made it difficult to ascertain the extent
of damage.
   The report said the latest tremor was felt in the provincial
capital of Kunming, 240 miles to the northeast.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seimographs.
   An earthquake with a reading of 6 is capable of causing
substantial damage in a populated area.

   Kathy Weibel, robbed by the two of the equivalent of $2,000 at

fake weapons, according to the newspaper, Blick.
   Mrs. Weibel, 60, then pursued them outside, hitting one in the

She chased him on foot, and he was captured by police, Blick said.
   She also noticed the license number of the accomplice's

   Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev, who have had
a testy relationship in the past, will attend a luncheon next week
while their husbands meet elsewhere in New York, it was announced
today.
   The meeting would occur at the same time as the session
tentatively set for Governor's Island, where President Reagan,
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Vice President George Bush
are to confer over lunch next Wednesday.
   The two women, whose frosty relationship has become a sideshow in
superpower gatherings, will attend a gathering hosted by Marcella
Perez de Cuellar, the wife of the U.N. Secretary General, Javier
Perez de Cuellar.
   Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman, Elaine Crispen, said that other
Americans and Soviets will be invited to the lunch, including
Barbara Bush and Helena Shultz. It will be held at Mrs. Perez de
Cuellar's residence in New York City, Mrs. Crispen said.
   Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman said the first lady planned to travel
to New York for a private dinner with friends on Tuesday evening and
that she did not expect to change that schedule.
   She plans to return to Washington Wednesday evening with the
president, Mrs. Crispen said.
   The testy relationship between Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Gorbachev was
apparent during their last meeting in Moscow during the spring
summit between Reagan and Gorbachev, as they openly competed for the
spotlight during their tours of Moscow and Leningrad.
   Mrs. Reagan has said she found the Soviet first lady to be
somewhat abrupt during their past encounters.
   In an interview published Nov. 13 in the Los Angeles Times, Mrs.
Reagan was asked whether she found Mrs. Gorbachev to be rude.
   ``By our standards, I suppose, yes,'' she replied. ``Now, by her
standards, it might not be.
   ``It's just coming from two completely different cultures and
trying to get together for the first time and maybe one not
understanding how the other works,'' she said.
   Mrs. Reagan also said she believes that ``there was way too much
attention paid about that whole thing.''
   Ever since the two women first met over tea at the first
Superpower summit in Geneva in November 1985, there have been
persistent reports that they did not get along.
   Mrs. Reagan did not accompany her husband to the hurry-up summit
held in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986, but Mrs. Gorbachev did,
a move that reportedly irked the first lady.
   Their differing styles clashed during the Washington summit last
December, when Mrs. Gorbachev repeatedly interrupted a White House
tour to talk with reporters about subjects ranging from U.S. history
to sociology.
   In Moscow, Mrs. Gorbachev again spoke at length to reporters,
while cutting off Mrs. Reagan's attempts to do so.
   Mrs. Reagan, insisting, ``I want to say something, I want to say
something now, OK?'' finally got her chance to chat with reporters
after the Soviet first lady backed away.

   Money has been rolling in since word got
out that a small Catholic college was stuck with 94,000 cookbooks
and a printer's bill for $400,000 after a fund-raising project went
awry.
   ``I call it `felix culpa.' It's a latin expression meaning happy
fault that is used frequently in monastic circles,'' said Sister
Judith O'Connell, assistant development director for Our Lady of the
Elms College.
   Sister Judith said Wednesday hundreds of mail orders have been
arriving daily at the women's college since, to the sisters'
chagrin, their plight was publicized in mid-November.
   ``People do care,'' she said. ``Those in Topeka, Kan., and
Houston, Texas, have been particularly kind, but we've gotten orders
from 20 states.''
   Although too swamped to give an exact number, she said more than
5,000 orders have already been filled, and some companies have
approached the sisters about distributing the book.
   ``If it keeps up we could sell all the cookbooks.'' she said.
``We really do believe in miracles. And the response to that story
has become part of our miracle.''
   The Sisters of St. Joseph, who run the 750-student college, had
hoped to raise $1 million for scholarships through sales of the
350-recipe book, ``In Good Taste'' at $10 a copy. But a year later
they had sold only 6,000 copies.
   Sister Mary Dooley, college president, acknowledged that the
100,000-copy printing may have been ``over optimistic.''
   ``We've gotten such lovely letters from all sorts of people,''
said Sister Judith.
   One man sent a check for $500 for 25 books. ``He said that he had
been educated by one of the sisters that is now working at the
college,'' she said. Another tried to cheer the sisters by tucking a
book of poetry into his order.
   ``Some said they were touched by a small school committed to
providing an education for people who wouldn't otherwise be able to
afford college,'' Sister Judith said. ``Others said they just
believed in religious education or were cookbook collectors. But in
large part, it is really a tribute to sisters all over the country
and the way these women have touched people's lives.''

<HEAD>Likud-Labor Prospects Grow with Religious Party Threats</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout with Labor leaders rejecting coalition talks
with Likud; no pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the left-leaning Labor Party
today voted to turn down a bid to enter into talks with the rival
Likud bloc on forming a coalition government.
   The vote of 61-57 by the party's executive bureau came after the
party's leader, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, argued in favor of
entering into negotiations with the right-wing Likud headed by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir. There was one abstention.
   Israel radio broadcast an immediate reaction from a spokesman in
the prime minister's office saying: ``There will be a government
headed by Shamir.''
   An offer by Likud for a joint government came after Shamir's
talks with ultra-Orthodox parties bogged down in the small parties'
demands for Cabinet posts and their call for controversial religious
legislation.
   Likud offered Labor two major Cabinet posts, defense and either
finance or the foreign ministry.
   Party spokeswoman Michal Cohen said both Peres and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the party's No. 2 man, argued for joining in
the talks.
   But many Labor members argued that the party would have to give
up its principles to join in a government with Likud such as the
joint Cabinet of the last four years.
   ``In the opposition, we can represent an alternative,'' argued
Labor Secretary-General Uzi Baram, who said that otherwise Labor
would be giving a far-reaching approval to Likud policies.
   The outgoing Cabinet was paralyzed on the peace process because
of conflicts between the dovish Labor and the hardline Likud. But it
succeeded in pulling together on important economic steps that
halted inflation.
   Others Labor members, such as parliament member Chaim Ramon, said
that Shamir would be unable to form a government without Labor,
meaning Peres could wind up forming his own government with small
parties.
   Ramon, a leader of the younger members of the party, said before
the vote: ``If we win this, there is a good chance Mr. Peres is
going to be prime minister for the next four years.''
   Israel radio reported today that Agudat Israel, one of the
religious parties that Shamir is trying to woo into his government,
was calling on Peres to form a government.
   But Shamir also convinced the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party that he
would carry through with promises to the religious parties after
Shas also threatened to reject any Likud-led coaltion.
   Shamir needs 61 seats in the 120-member Knesset to control a
coalition.
   Likud won 40 seats in the 120-member Knesset in Nov. 1 elections.
Labor won 39.
   The Shas and Agudat Israel parties control 11 seats in the
Knesset, or parliament, enough to make or break a narrow coalition.
   Likud's efforts to meet Orthodox demands for joining the
government have angered both non-religious Jews in Israel, who form
the majority, and foreign Jews.
   American Jews, who follow mostly Reform or Conservative Judaism,
were irate at Orthodox parties' demands to narrow the definition of
who is a Jew. Many Israelis were upset by Orthodox demands to close
down movies and sports stadiums on the Sabbath.
   When Shamir tried to bring Labor into the government, the
ultra-Orthodox parties balked, fearing they would lose promised
Cabinet posts and their power to make fundamentalist Jewish causes
part of government policy.

<TEXT>
   A 23-year-old man who sued the heavy-metal rock
group Judas Priest after his 1985 suicide attempt has died six days
after lapsing into a coma, a hospital spokesman said today.
   James Vance was pronounced dead at 10:48 p.m. Tuesday, Washoe
Medical Center spokesman David Stipech said. He had been in a coma
and on life support since Thanksgiving Day.
   An autopsy was scheduled to determine the cause of Vance's death.
   Vance and his parents are suing Judas Priest, claiming subliminal
messages in the British group's music caused Vance and Raymond
Belknap, 19, to make a suicide pact after listening to the group's
``Stained Class'' album for several hours.
   The two took a shotgun to a church playground in nearby Sparks
two days before Christmas 1985 and shot themselves in the head.
Belknap died instantly and Vance was disfigured after shooting away
part of his face.
   The 1986 lawsuit filed by the Vance and Belknap families is
pending in Washoe District Court.
   Vance was admitted to the hospital Nov. 15 for treatment of
depression and was scheduled to be released last Thursday, the day
he went into a coma.
   Phyllis Vance said doctors told her a short time later that her
son was 99.9 percent brain dead.
   Vance's attorney, Timothy Post, said he has ``a strong, strong
hunch'' that a drug overdose sent his client into a coma. Before
Vance died, Post said his death would have no effect on the lawsuit.
   He added that Vance already has given lengthy depositions which
could be read in a court proceeding.
   Mrs. Vance said doctors told her only that they were uncertain
what caused the coma.

   A cyclone battered low-lying coastal
areas of southern Bangladesh and eastern India, killing at least 317
people and razing hundreds of mud huts, officials and news reports
said today.
   At least 275 fishermen were repoprted missing in Bangladesh.
   The casualty toll was expected to rise after reports arrived from
hundreds of tiny islands and remote villages cut off after
communication lines snapped during Tuesday's storm.
   Officials at the Cyclone Prepardness Center in Dhaka said that
the cyclone killed 288 people in southern Bangladesh.
   Press Trust of India news agency said 29 people perished in
eastern India.
   Sources at the southern port of Chittagong said that a Singapore
registered vessel, the Pamir, sank in the cyclone with 16 crew on
board. The fate of the crew members was not know, but port officials
said they were presumed dead.
   On the river Teesta, a boat caught up in the storm capsized near
Bhairab, 45 miles northeast of Dhaka, and 20 of the 24 passengers
were swept away and killed, an official said.
   Food Minister Amjad Hossain said he expected the casulty figures
to go up, but said timely evacuation of thousands of people had
dimished loss of lives.
   
   Abdul Muqtadir Ahmed, Deputy Commissioner for Khulna district in
southwest Bangladesh, one of the areas hardest hit, said at least 21
people died there. Khulna district is about 110 miles southwest of
Dhaka.
   He said nine people died when an electric power pole fell over a
house in Khulna. Another nine people died when a house collapsed
near Mongla port, near Khulna, Ahmed said.
   At least three others were killed in house collapses in the
district.
   A senior government official in Dhaka said Red Crescent
volunteers evacuated thousands of people before the storm hit.
   Announcements over public address systems blared every five
minutes to warn residents of the storm's progress. Fishermen were
advised to find a safe place to anchor their boats.
   Officials at the Bangladesh metereological office said the
coastal districts of Patuakhali, Barguna, Barisal, Bhola, Bagerhat
and Satkhira faced the brunt of the storm.
   ``Extensive damage has been done to the crop ready for
harvesting. Most mud and straw houses and tin shed offices and
school buildings have been leveled by the storm,'' said Ahmed,
contacted by phone from Dhaka.
   The port city of Chittagong, about 130 miles southwest of Dhaka,
was battered by strong winds and rain.
   Dhaka, a city of 6 million, was hit by winds up to 75 mph,
causing extensive damage to power and telephone lines. The power
outage disrupted the city's water distribution.
   An official at the meteorological office said the storm weakened
as it crossed Bangladesh and the northeastern districts of India.
   Southern Bangladesh is barely above sea level, and there are
hundreds of islands, some little more than sandbars.
   At least 500,000 people died when a cyclone struck the area in
1970, and at least 10,000 were swept away in a 1985 cyclone.

<HEAD>FCC OKs Long Distance Cut Effective Thursday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said today
it will cut its basic interstate long-distance rates by an average
of 3.8 percent on Thursday, the same day that local phone costs will
rise 60 cents per month.
   AT&T's cut, totaling $697 million annually, reflects lower costs
for its connections to the local network, while residential and
small business customers will be paying a larger share of the costs
to maintain the local phone network.
   The rate reduction is AT&T's seventh since 1984, when the company
was broken up by an antitrust lawsuit. During those five years, the
company's prices for basic interstate long-distance have dropped a
total of 38 percent.
   During that time, however, $2.60 has been added to the monthly
bills of subscribers to lower the local network subsidies paid by
long-distance companies. That monthly expense will rise to $3.20 on
Thursday.
   AT&T estimates that subscribers who make at least $16 a month in
interstate long-distance calls would save enough money to offset the
higher subscriber line charge. The average residential customer
spends $8.66 per month on interstate long-distance calls, the
company said. Those totals do not include intrastate long-distance
calls.
   AT&T filed its reduced rate request with the Federal
Communications Commission in October. An AT&T spokeswoman said the
commission did not disapprove the proposal, so the new rates will go
into effect as planned.
   Other long distance companies have said they are reviewing the
latest AT&T reductions.
   Under AT&T's proposal:
   _Basic long-distance rates for calls of more than 124 miles will
drop 3.8 percent. Smaller cuts would be seen for interstate calls of
shorter distances, which account for about one-quarter of AT&T
interstate calls.
   _Rates for Reach Out America, AT&T's long-distance calling plan
for residential customers, will be cut 4.9 percent.
   _AT&T WATS rates will drop 4 percent and the company will
restructure the service to bill calls individually based on time and
distance, rather than by the current hourly pricing method. This
price reduction would take effect Jan. 1, a month later than the
others.
   _Rates for AT&T's three PRO WATS calling plans for business
customers will be cut 3.8 percent overall. MEGACOM WATS rates will
drop 4.7 percent and MEGACOM 800 rates would decrease 4.8 percent.
   _Basic AT&T 800 service prices will go down 4 percent.
   _Software Defined Network Service rates will see an overall
reduction of 6.2 percent.

   A 3-year-old New Mexico girl who underwent a
rare, five-organ transplant was awake and being weaned off a
respirator Wednesday, hospital officials said.
   Rolandrea Dodge of Fruitland, N.M., remained in critical
condition in the intensive care unit of Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh. Critical condition is considered normal following
transplant surgery.
   Her parents, Branden and Cyndi Dodge, were at her bedside as much
as possible. The couple also have two sons.
   ``She's a very bright little girl. I'm sure if she could she'd be
asking what's going on,'' said hospital spokeswoman Sue Cardillo.
   Rolandrea, who's known as Rolly, received a new liver, pancreas,
stomach, small intestine and part of a large intestine during 16{
hours of surgery that ended Tuesday. She was placed on the waiting
list for a suitable donor last week after an experimental drug
failed to improve her condition.
   Rolly was born with an incurable disease that prevented her
intestines from absorbing food and liquids. Her high-protein
intravenous feedings caused her liver to fail.
   The only other five-organ transplant recipient, Tabatha Foster,
3{, of Madisonville, Ky., died in May, six months after her landmark
operation at Children's Hospital.
   Doctors say Rolly should do as well as a liver recipient if all
goes well. About 80 percent of the hospital's liver transplant
children survive the first year.

   Commuters huddled in open army trucks Wednesday for
a wet and cold trip to work, but most said they were relieved to
have a ride as a strike by Paris transit workers stretched into a
third day.
   Two out of four regional express train lines were paralyzed by a
maintenance workers' strike called by the communist-led General
Confederation of Labor.
   City buses and the Metro also have had disruptions, but most
Metro lines were running normally and the transit agency reported
buses running at about 60 percent of normal.
   Beginning about 6:30 a.m., more than 200 military vehicles hit
the road, each crammed with up to 25 people struggling to get to
work on the cold, rainy morning.
   ``It's original, it's practical and it works, which is more than
I can say for the express trains,'' said Erik Saliou, a financial
adviser from Nanterre, west of the capital, who arrived in one of
the soggy green transport trucks at the La Defense complex in
western Paris.
   ``It has been enormously difficult getting to work,'' he said.
``Tonight I'll take a bus if I can find one, or this truck if I can
find it. I'll take what I can get.''
   The trucks, brought in from eastern France and from French bases
in West Germany along with a thousand soldiers, carried only a
fraction of the 600,000 people who normally commute on the express
trains. More military vehicles were en route to Paris.
   Officials said several hundred private buses were also being
chartered to replace the trains.
   Many people opted to drive, causing huge traffic jams. Commuters
arriving in trucks at the Porte d'Orleans at the southern edge of
Paris said it took 90 minutes on clogged highways for what is
normally a 30-minute ride on the train.
   At the Porte de Vincennes in eastern Paris, soldiers who worked
the morning rush hour reported a cheerful atmosphere. Soldiers at La
Defense said the same.
   ``People were very nice. They were just happy to get here,'' said
Sgt. T.H. Lagniel, of the 135th transport regiment in Karlsruhe,
West Germany. ``For us, this gives us contact we wouldn't ordinarily
have with the civilian population.''
   Not everyone viewed the unusual commute in a positive light.
   ``I feel like a victim,'' said computer operator Houria
Bendahmane after a two-hour ride on a cold metal bench from a
western suburb.
   Ms. Bendahmane climbed out of the truck, holding down her short
skirt with one hand and a supporting bar with the other while
setting a high-heeled foot gingerly on a stool held by a young
lieutenant. She was followed out of the truck by an elderly woman
wearing sneakers and carrying dress shoes and a banker in a navy,
cashmere coat, who climbed down and rushed away.
   ``We were well-assisted, but frankly it was not too comfortable.
It was cold and windy and wet. It was noisy,'' Ms. Bendahmane said.
   Michel Rousselot, head of the Paris Autonomous Transit Agency,
said after 14 hours of meetings with representatives of the labor
federation and six other unions the agency was sticking to the
salary offers rejected by the unions. He said no end to the strike
was in sight.
   The federation, the dominant union at the transit agency, is
demanding increased safety measures and across-the-board pay
increases of about $170 per month.
   The transit agency has offered immediate monthly raises of about
$25 plus bonuses ranging from about $17 to $100. For next year, the
agency is offering an increase of 2.2 percent. The current average
monthly salary is about $1,100.
   After the meeting, the labor federation and a smaller union, the
French Democratic Confederation of Labor, both called for the strike
to continue, while the other unions said they would consult their
members.
   President Francois Mitterrand said Tuesday the government acted
wisely in calling out the army, rather than give in to ``a small
number of persons, cabable of blocking an entire system.''
   The opposition conservatives in the National Assembly introduced
a censure motion condemning the social policies of Socialist Premier
Michel Rocard.
   In recent weeks, nurses, postal employees, government office
workers and other public service staff have staged strikes, all
seeking wage increases higher than those called for in Rocard's
policy of economic ``rigor.''
   Jacques Malladur, a taxi driver waiting to pick up commuters at
La Defense, blamed the unionized civil servants for the deadlock in
the strike.
   ``They can go on forever with no risk of losing their jobs,'' he
said, referring to the protection from lay-offs enjoyed by public
sector workers.
   ``This is a military action,'' he said. ``But then, this is war.''

   The Soviet Union on Tuesday stopped jamming
Radio Liberty broadcasts for the first time in 38 years, officials
said today, as thousands of jamming transmitters blocking most
Western broadcasts into the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were
silenced.
   Jane Lester, spokeswoman for Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty,
said the service monitored all of its broadcasts overnight and found
no jamming except for Radio Free Europe transmissions to
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria.
   ``This is really a momentous event,'' said Stanley Leinwoll, U.S.
engineering director for the services in New York City. He said
between 2,000 and 2,500 jamming devices were shut down in the Soviet
Union, along with others run by Eastern European governments.
   The lifting affected most Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty and
Radio Free Afghanistan services of the U.S. government along with
most Israeli KOL transmissions and West German Deutsch Velle
broadcasts beamed toward the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, said
Beth Knisley, a spokeswoman for the Voice of America.
   Radio Liberty, run by the U.S. government, broadcasts in native
languages to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe from Munich, West
Germany. VOA also broadcasts to those areas but operates separately
from Radio Liberty.
   Only the VOA and West German broadcasts into Afghanistan and U.S.
broadcasts into Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria remained jammed last
night, Ms. Knisley said.
   She said the Soviets have not said why the jamming was stopped
but added, ``It saves them a lot of money, though.''
   The Soviets stopped jamming nearly all broadcasts by VOA, which
transmits in 43 languages throughout the world, in May 1986. Last
Jan. 1, Polish jamming of VOA also stopped.
   The Soviets have been jamming Radio Liberty continuously for more
than three decades. Ms. Knisley said one listener who talked to a
VOA researcher said Tuesday he had picked up a broadcast for the
first time since the 1950s. She said she did not know where the
listener lived.
   VOA is part of the United States Information Agency, but Radio
Free Europe-Radio Liberty operates as a separate government radio
service.
   ``The jamming stopped as of last night about 9 p.m. (4 p.m.
EST),'' Radio Liberty spokesman Bob Redlich said in Munich.
   Radio Liberty transmits news, music and information programs to
the Soviet Union in more than a dozen languages. Radio Free Europe
transmits to the other Soviet Bloc countries, including Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria in their own
languages.
   Radio Free Europe began operating in 1950; Radio Liberty started
its tranmissions to the Soviet Union in 1951.

<HEAD>Three Missing Iranians Becoming Key Element in Hostage Drama</HEAD>

   Three Iranians seized in Lebanon by
Christian militiaman six years ago are becoming an important element
in efforts to free Western hostages held by Lebanese kidnappers
loyal to Iran.
   Senior officials in Tehran have offered in recent months to use
their influence with the Lebanese Shiite Moslems holding Westerners
if the hostages' governments helped locate and free the Iranians.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's military commander and parliament
speaker, addressed this remark to Washington last week: ``If you are
interested in having your people held hostage in Lebanon released,
then tell the Phalangists (Christian militia) to release our people
who have been in their hands for years.''
   Mohammad Javad Larijani, Iranian deputy foreign minister, told
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany on Tuesday:
``There aren't just American hostages in Lebanon. There are also
Iranian hostages who are in the hands of Christian militiamen.''
   Informed Lebanese sources have said the Iranians were believed
killed soon after their abductions, like hundreds of other Moslems
and Christians seized by the other side in Lebanon's 13-year-old
civil war.
   One purpose of Genscher's trip to Tehran was to mediate the
release of Western captives. His good contacts in Iranian leaders
were a key factor in the release of three West Germans held in
Lebanon.
   Nine Americans are among the 14 Western captives in Lebanon.
Peter Winkler, a Swiss employee of the Red Cross employee, was
abducted by three unidentified gunmen Nov. 17 but there has been no
claim of responsibility.
   Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Christian militiamen seized the three Iranians and their Lebanese
Shiite driver, who had an Iranian passport, in July 1982 at a
checkpoint 25 miles north of Beirut during the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon.
   They were identified as Ahmad Motevaselian, commander of the
Iranian Revolutionary Guards based in the Bekaa Valley of eastern
Lebanon; Charge d'Affaires Hussein Musavi, and Kazem Akhavan, a
correspondent for Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   The checkpoint at the extreme norh of Lebanon's Christian
enclave, was controlled at the time by the Lebanese Forces, the main
Christian amilitia.
   Nothing was heard of the Iranians until Aug. 31, when Samir
Geagea, now commander of the Lebanese Forces, confirmed the militia
had seized them.
   Geagea added that he could find no trace of the missing men when
he took over the 6,000-member militia in 1986 after a bloody
factional battle.
   He accused his predecessor, Elie Hobeika, of kidnapping the
Iranians and taking them to his Beirut headquarters for
interrogation ``because they were foreigners.''
   Their car was found abandoned in Tripoli, a predominantly Moslem
port 50 miles north of Beirut, several days after they disappeared,
Geagea said. He did not explain how it got there.
   Hobeika, ousted as Lebanese Forces commander in January 1986, was
widely believed to have led pro-Israeli Christian militiamen who
massacred hundreds of men, women and children in Beirut's Sabra and
Chatilla refugee camps in September 1982.
   The slaughter apparently was in revenge for the bomb
assassination several days earlier of President-elect Bashir
Gemayel, a Maronite Catholic, which the Lebanese Forces blamed on
Palestinian guerrillas.
   After two visits to Beirut in August seeking word of the
Iranians, the Right Rev. John Brown said their fate remains a
mystery.
   ``I haven't found any concrete evidence that will suggest to me
beyond doubt that they are alive or dead,'' said Brown, the Anglican
bishop of the Persian Gulf and Cyprus.
   He was sent to Lebanon by Archbishop Robert Runcie, spiritual
head of the Church of England, ``to show the Iranian government that
the Christian Church has a compassionate interest in Moslem victims
of the war in Lebanon as it has ... in the fate of Christian people
who've been taken.''
   The bishop had visited Tehran earlier seeking help in freeing
Britons held in Lebanon. They include Runcie's personal envoy, Terry
Waite, who disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his hotel in
Moslem west Beirut to negotiate with kidnappers holding Americans.
   Brown said senior officials in Tehran made clear they would use
their influence with the kidnappers after the fate of the Iranians
was determined.

   An investigator who discovered two dead and 23
starving greyhounds at a kennel said Wednesday that four unopened
50-pound bags of dog food also were found.
   Jaye Perrett, chief investigator with the Marion County Humane
Society cruelty division, described the dogs as ``covered with ticks
and fleas and extremely emaciated.''
   The dogs were living at the Sandy Run Acres boarding and training
kennel in Sparr, north of Ocala. Kennel owner Sandra Borcheller, 25,
was arrested Tuesday on 25 counts each of animal abandonment and
animal cruelty.
   Ms. Borcheller was held Wednesday in the Marion County Jail on
$25,000 cash bond.
   She owned 12 of the dogs, including two that were found dead, Ms.
Perrett said. Ms. Borcheller said financial difficulties, including
the failure of some owners to pay kennel bills, kept her from
feeding the dogs, according to Ms. Perrett.
   ``The people I talked to from out of state said they had been
paying their board bills faithfully,'' Ms. Perrett said.
   Out-of-state owners tipped investigators to abuses at the kennel,
Ms. Perrett said. ``They had gone there to check on their dogs and
were told that their dogs had died.''
   Fifteen of the dogs have been destroyed, Ms. Perrett said.
   The surviving dogs are being cared for by the Humane Society
until their owners can arrange to pick them up.
   ``They're eating like little piglets, just as hungry as they can
be,'' Ms. Perrett said.

   Authorities said Wednesday they will
improve security at a nuclear reactor after marines posing as
terrorists staged a mock attack last week.
   The 20 marines needed only seven minutes to get to the Petten
reactor vault, which houses uranium suitable for making nuclear
bombs, news reports said.
   The research reactor near this northwestern village is operated
by the European Economic Community.
   Economic Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Jane Zuidema said the time
it took to stage the mock attack ``was too short for an outside
(security) unit to come to the scene,'' adding that private security
guards in the building were unarmed. The exercise was part of a
program to check responses to ``new terrorist techniques'' that
might be used against the nation's four nuclear reactors, Ms.
Zuidema said. She did not say what new security measures were
adopted.

<HEAD>Men Do More Housework, But Still Trail Women</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American women still do most of the cooking,
laundering and housecleaning, but men have accepted an increased
share of other household chores such as pet care, gardening and
dealing with bills, a university study shows.
   Overall, American women do two hours of housework for every one
hour put in by a man, according to the report by sociologist John P.
Robinson of the University of Maryland.
   Robinson's findings, based on his 1985 survey of 5,000 men and
women, compare to earlier, similar studies at the University of
Michigan which said that women performed a 3-to-1 share of housework
in 1975 and nearly 6 to 1 in 1965.
   All three analyses found four primarily female tasks _ cooking
meals, cleaning up after meals, housecleaning and laundry.
   Men dominated two areas, yard work and home repairs, Robinson
found.
   And two areas where women previously did the majority of the work
_ physically dealing with bills and the combined category of
gardening and pet care _ were about evenly divided in the most
recent report.
   ``Several important trends account for shifts in who does how
much housework,'' Robinson said. These include declines in the share
of households with children, a smaller share of married-couple
households and the increasing number of women in the paid workforce.
   Robinson's study is reported in the December edition of American
Demographics magazine, which concentrates on population and
statistics issues.
   In 1985, Robinson found, men averaged 9.8 hours of housework
weekly, while women put in 19.5 hours.
   The 1975 study found men working 7.0 hours a week on home tasks
compared to 21.7 hours for women.
   And a decade earlier, men spent 4.6 hours a week on housework,
compared to 27.0 hours for women.
   But despite the increasing male share of the load, men and women
still tended to observe traditional separations of tasks. For
example, in 1965 some 98 percent of washing and ironing was done by
women, while by 1985 that was only down to 88 percent. Women did 87
percent of cooking in 1965, and 77 percent in 1985.
   On the other hand, men did only 32 percent of the bill-paying
chores in 1965 but increased their share to 52 percent by 1985.
   And men did 53 percent of the gardening and pet care in 1985, up
from 33 percent two decades earlier.
   Women with children under age 5 averaged 22.5 hours of housework
weekly in 1985, compared to 19.9 hours for women with children over
age 5 and 17.9 hours for childless women. All three figures are down
from prior years.
   The studies show that getting married in 1965 increased a woman's
housework time from 15.5 hours weekly to 31.6 hours. Men, on the
other hand, eased their burden a bit, averaging 4.7 hours when
single and only 4.5 hours after getting married.
   By 1985, marriage increased the housework for women from 14.9
hours to 22.4 hours, while men worked 7.9 hours on housework when
single and 11.1 hours after getting married.
   In 1965 a housewife averaged 34 hours of housework a week,
compared to 17.8 hours for women with paid jobs. By 1985 that had
declined to 23.6 hours for the women at home and 14.7 hours for
those with jobs.

<HEAD>Denver Met Clean-Air Standards For First Time in 13 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in at least 13 years, Denver met
federal clean-air standards for the entire month of November, but
officials say it was the weather and not motorists' driving habits
that made the difference.
   The weather pattern responsible for Denver's clean air also has
been blamed for subnormal moisture in eastern Colorado, a
development officials say could jeopardize the winter wheat crop.
   Each day that passes without a high-pollution day in metropolitan
Denver further extends the record for the season's first violation.
The record was broken Nov. 6.
   Although anti-pollution programs such as high-oxygen fuel sales
and voluntary no-drive days are under way, the credit for the clean
air goes to an atmospheric current that typically reaches Denver
just a few winters in each decade, said National Weather Service
forecaster Steve Markkanen.
   ``Most of us consider this pattern ideal,'' Markkanen said. ``It
brings the mountains a lot of snow, gives Denver little or no snow,
and doesn't let much pollution build up in Denver.
   ``We'd like it to continue all winter. With some luck, it could
last a couple of months,'' he said.
   Markkanen said that by late fall, Colorado usually is under the
spell of an arctic weather pattern called the Continental Polar.
This year, that air stream has been passing 1,000 miles north of
Denver, and in its place has been the Maritime Polar current, which
leaves heavier-than-normal snowfall in the high country, but skips
much of the Colorado's eastern Plains.
   Little snow is beneficial because that means higher ground
temperatures. Colder surface temperatures, combined with warm air
flowing from the mountains west of Denver, help create temperature
inversions that trap pollutants at ground level.
   But the lack of snowfall in eastern Colorado could mean trouble
for the 2.5 million acres of winter wheat planted on the eastern
plains.
   Precipitation in November was about 40 percent lower than normal,
prompting worries that farmers could face a dry winter, officials
said.

<HEAD>Tourist, Media Attention Drops For Atlantis Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon secrecy, ominous weather and
a general feeling of anti-climax have discouraged tourists and
journalists from flocking here for the Atlantis shuttle launch.
   ``I think it's really a combination,'' Dick Young, head of the
NASA News Bureau at the Kennedy Space Center, said Wednesday. ``STS
26 (the Sept. 29 Discovery launch) was the first post-Challenger
flight and a lot of people were out here just to see if the shuttle
could fly, and we've proved that it could.''
   Because the Atlantis is carrying a military cargo, the Department
of Defense sharply restricts information, another reason for fewer
journalists, Young said. NASA expected fewer than 500 journalists,
in contrast with the nearly 2,500 who covered the Discovery launch,
the first shuttle flight since the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger
disaster.
   ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN planned live coverage of the launch, but
their morning and evening news shows won't be anchored from the
space center as they were for the Discovery mission.
   ``Dan Rather is staying in New York and we're covering here with
about one-fourth the number of people,'' said Mark Kramer, CBS News
producer for special events. ``I believe the edge is off the story.''
   However, Kramer said he couldn't foresee any shuttle launch in
the near future that won't be carried live on network television.
Only CNN was on live when the Challenger exploded after liftoff,
killing the seven astronauts aboard.
   About 250,000 spectators lined roads and beaches to watch
Discovery lift off, but far fewer people were expected this time _
even before an approaching storm front threatened to postpone the
launch by a day or more.
   Hotels along the ``Space Coast'' that were packed for Discovery
had plenty of vacancies, and local authorities, not worrying about
traffic jams or crowd control, said only a few extra deputies would
be on duty at launch time.
   Because of the secrecy, NASA was not setting up its customary VIP
viewing site for celebrities and other special guests.
   Left moot for now was a dispute between journalists and NASA over
the post-Challenger decision to restrict the number of news media at
the launch site. NASA, citing safety concerns in case of a launch
accident, allowed 1,800 journalists at the complex less than four
miles from the launchpad. The others had to watch from a secondary
press site about seven miles from the pad.
   Young said the restriction policy will be reviewed if such a
large contingent of journalists turns out for a future launch.

   A state governor on Wednesday pardoned
a former member of the Red Army Faction terrorist gang sentenced to
life in prison for shooting and killing a police officer,
authorities said.
   Manfred Grashof will be released because he has rejected his
militant views, said Hanns Schreiner, a spokesman for Gov. Bernhard
Vogel of the southern state of Rhineland-Palatinate.
   Grashof, 42, who has been in prison for nearly 17 years, was held
in investigative custody before a Rhineland-Palatinate state court
covicted and sentenced him in 1977. He is to be released on March 2,
1989, Schreiner said.
   Vogel, a member of the conservative Christian Democrat Union,
pardoned former Red Army Faction member Klaus Juenschke in June,
saying he also had given up his terrorist views.
   The group, which claimed responsibility for the attempted
assassination of a Finance Ministry official in September, evolved
from the Baader-Meinhof terrorist gang active in the 1960s.

   The radio and TV reporters in the state-owned company demanded a

   A satellite company said Wednesday the
Soviet Union appears to be making nuclear weapons fuel again in an
area east of the Urals that was contaminated and abandoned after a
nuclear accident 30 years ago.
   ``The Soviets apparently think it is a logical step to have
activity that is contaminating in a contaminated area ... and they
seem to have the means to get people to work there,'' said Christer
Larsson, head of the Swedish-based Space of Media Network.
   Larsson said satellite photos taken by the Spot and Landsat
satellites in 1987 and last summer showed the Kysthym complex is
back in operation and a new facility is being expanded nearby.
   In a 100-square-mile area around it, all villages were abandoned,
there was no farming and many were overgrown with vegetation, he
said.
   The satellite images also showed the flow of water through Lake
Kyzyltash was cut off to keep contaminated water out of the Tech
River system, Larsson said.
   The Soviet Union started its nuclear weapons program in the 1940s
at the Kysthym complex to produce plutonium, a main component of
nuclear arms.
   It is widely believed there was a massive release of radiation at
Kysthum during the winter of 1957-58. The cause of the accident is
unknown and the Soviet authorities have refused to confirm it ever
happened.
   The company quoted Zhores Medvedev, an emigre Soviet biologist
who 21 years ago reported the accident to the West, as saying his
countrymen dumped nuclear waste into small lakes in the area,
filling them up almost completely.
   Medvedev, who lives in London, also was quoted as saying he heard
from Soviet nuclear safety officials that a second major accident
occurred in the area in 1967. This could not, however, be confirmed
by the satellite photos, Larsson said.
   The satellite company said the new nuclear facility lies three
miles northeast of the Kysthym complex. It is believed to be part of
a new set of military reactors constructed after 1977. It is not
listed in any official publication. The satellite photos showed that
it was expanded in 1987 and 1988 but was not in operation when the
photos were taken.
   But a major flow of hot water into Lake Kyzyltash showed the
Kysthym complex was operational, the company said. The hot water
would indicate it was being used for cooling reactors.
   The company showed photographs of the area to journalists but did
not make prints immediately available, saying they were for sale
only.

<HEAD>State Taxes On Oil, Gas From Reservations Argued</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States do not trample on Indian rights by
taxing companies that produce oil and gas from tribal reservations,
New Mexico officials told the Supreme Court Wednesday.
   Attorney General Harold D. Stratton of New Mexico said the state
taxes do not discourage production or prompt producers to look off
the reservations for deposits.
   ``The taxes in no way hindered economic development,'' he said.
   But Daniel H. Israel, a lawyer for Cotton Petroleum Corp., said
the state taxes have ``a chilling effect'' on the ability of the
tribes to lease their land to private businesses.
   ``Inevitably, off-reservation development is more attractive
because of the lighter tax burden,'' he said.
   The justices, who heard 60 minutes of arguments, are expected to
announce a ruling in the case by July. The outcome is likely to be
important to Western states seeking guidance on what power they have
over tribal resources.
   Cotton Petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some
15,000 acres of land on the Jicarilla Apache reservation in New
Mexico.
   The company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percent
of its production and New Mexico levies five taxes on the company
amounting to 8 percent of its production.
   Cotton Petroleum challenged the two biggest state taxes on ground
they unlawfully overlap the tribal levies, violating constitutional
interstate commerce protections. The company noted that oil and gas
producers in the state with deposits taken from non-Indian land only
are taxed 8 percent of production.
   The company also said the state taxes are pre-empted by the
Constitution, because they conflict with federal laws aimed at
promoting Indian self-determination.
   The company said it paid $2.3 million in taxes to New Mexico from
1981 through 1985 but only received $89,000 in services from the
state.
   The New Mexico Court of Appeals upheld the state taxes last year.
   Stratton has said the case ``may very well set the course of
Indian-state jurisdiction in the future.'' He said there are more
than 250 cases nationwide that could be affected by the outcome.
   One issue the justices could decide is whether a tribe is
entitled to be treated in some instances as a state.
   Israel said Wednesday the court should afford that treatment to
Indian reservations ``in a limited sense only.''
   He argued, for example, that the Jicarilla tribe should have
``primary power with regard to its resources,'' thus limiting New
Mexico's authority.
   But Stratton said that approach could open the way to widespread
confusion.
   ``How we could treat tribes as states troubles me,'' he said,
noting there are some 250 reservations nationwide.
   The Jicarilla tribe is not a direct participant in the case,
although it has filed a so-called friend-of-the-court brief
expressing its views.
   The case is Cotton Petroleum Corp vs. New Mexico, 87-1327.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said Wednesday the time is ripe for
Cuba and the United States to take ``small steps'' aimed at moving
them toward ``more rational and normalized relations.''
   Pell also said Radio Marti, which beams news and entertainment
broadcasts to Cuba, ``exacerbates'' relations between the two
countries and should be curtailed.
   The Rhode Island Democrat commented after a trip to Cuba, which
included a private, three-hour meeting with President Fidel Castro.
   When apprised of Pell's comments, Sen.-elect Connie Mack, R-Fla.,
told reporters that normalizing relations with Cuba or cutting back
on Radio Marti was a bad idea.
   ``Absolutely not,'' said Mack, whose state has a large
Cuban-American population. ``This is not a time to show concessions.
We've got to keep the pressure on Castro.''
   But Pell said he believes the international climate favors moves
toward warming relations with the communist island state 90 miles
from U.S. shores.
   ``Peace is busting out all over the world,'' he said. ``We are on
the verge of a settlement in Angola with the withdrawal of Cuban
troops, the Soviets are committed to withdrawing from Afghanistan,
and U.S.-Soviet relations are vastly improved.''
   ``I return from this trip believing ... it is an appropriate time
to attempt to move toward more rational and normalized relations
with Cuba,'' Pell said. ``The policies of both governments have
become sterile; it is time to break the log jam.''
   He proposed opening talks between the two countries to discuss
the many issues that divide them.
   ``The Cubans expressed sincere interest in my suggestion that
relations can be improved by each country taking small steps to
demonstrate good will and upon which other, progressively more
difficult but mutually beneficial steps can be taken.''
   Pell said he is considering introducing legislation to lift the
current embargo on the delivery of medicines and medical supplies to
Cuba ``as a step in this spirit of moving toward a normalized and
rational relationship.''
   He said Cuba might respond by releasing the remaining long-held
political prisoners in that country and by cooperating with the U.S.
Coast Guard against narcotics trafficking.
   He also suggested that restrictions be eased on telephone calls
between Cuba and the United States and that more Cubans, especially
doctors and technicians, be permitted to visit the United States.
   ``We should begin with the little things while working toward the
more difficult issues like (Cuban involvement in) Central America
and the full embargo, so that, hopefully, the climate could be
created making possible a relationship that would better serve U.S.
foreign policy interests,'' Pell said.
   He said Castro ``got really excited'' when the issue of Radio
Marti was raised in the talks and denounced the broadcasts as an
infringement of Cuban sovereignty.
   Pell said Castro did not explicity state that he wanted better
relations with the United States and emphasized the problems and
irritants in the relationship.
   But he said Castro did say ``that they were interested in going
from one small step to another.''
   In another development Wednesday, President Reagan met with
Ricardo Bofill, founder and former head of the Cuban Human Rights
Committee, in a meeting his spokesman said ``underscores the
president's continued support for human rights in Cuba.''
   ``The president commended Mr. Bofill's efforts on behalf of human
rights and added that they serve as an inspiration for activists
worldwide,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.
   Fitzwater said the committee, an independent human rights group
hostile to the Castro government, ``was a factor in leading to a
U.N. Human Rights Commission visit to investigate the situation'' in
Cuba.

   Got a complaint about taxi service? Tell the
driver _ he could be someone with clout.
   Jack Lusk, new chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission,
plans to see how things look from behind the wheel. He says he will
be driving a Yellow cab on a ``regular basis'' _ even on weekends.
   ``I think it gives you a continuing sense of what is going on in
the street,'' Lusk said.
   The 37-year-old Lusk, who began his new job three weeks ago,
heads for his final day of taxi school on Saturday, after which a
cab fleet will provide his rig at no charge. He plans to donate his
profits to charity.
   A commission spokeswoman, Ellen Weiman, says Lusk is the first
chairman she's heard of to take the wheel while in the driver's seat
of the commission.
   ``This is the way that 40,000 guys make an income. There's
nothing wrong with the chairman going out and seeing how they do
it,'' Lusk said.

   Graduating from college near the top of
the class is a heady experience, especially for a woman whose
professional experience included a stint as a headless woman.
   Mary Ann Beauregard, 26, of Greenwich will be among the nearly
600 degree candidates at the first fall undergraduate commencement
at Central Connecticut State University on Saturday.
   Beauregard, who once worked as ``Headless Helga'' in a carnival
sideshow in Denver, Colo., will receive a bachelor's degree in a
self-designed major, peace studies.
   She enrolled at Central Connecticut in 1982, ending up in the

<HEAD>GOP Claims Mitchell Election Moves Senate To Left</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A day after he was elected majority leader,
Sen. George Mitchell said today that Democrats and Republicans
should move past their campaign attacks to face their biggest shared
problem _ the federal deficit.
   ``The campaign is over. We have serious problems, important
challenges facing the country,'' the Maine Democrat said, as he met
with his Republican counterpart, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Both pointed to the budget shortfall as Congress' top priority.
But each stuck to his party's position:
   _Mitchell said Bush should submit his own proposals to cut the
deficit before Congress negotiates with the White House on such
touchy topics as spending cuts and tax increases.
   _Dole said Bush could wait, letting President Reagan submit his
fiscal 1990 budget next month and then, when the new president takes
office, make his own recommendations for changes.
   Appearing separately, the speaker of the House, Rep. Jim Wright,
called on Bush to reject his advisers' suggestions and quickly give
Congress his plan for cutting the deficit as a way of calming
jittery financial markets.
   Democrats want to force Bush to be specific on how he would cut
the deficit without raising taxes and still keep his other campaign
promises to boost spending in such areas as education, day care and
environmental cleanup.
   Bush has been silent on the question of whether he will submit
his own spending plan or simply go directly into negotiations with
Congress over the 1990 budget.
   While Republicans agreed with Democrats today on the need to work
together, Republicans made it clear Tuesday that they will point out
differences between themselves and the liberal Mitchell.
   ``I think it's a very good choice. George is very liberal, and it
will push the Senate to the left,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a
conservative. ``Whoever won that race was destined to be the
spokesman for the Democrats in America.''
   ``It seems to me the Democrats have decided to move toward the
left wing of the party and decided to do so with considerable
momentum,'' said Richard Lugar, R-Ind. ``This could make it easier
for Bob Dole, as our leader, to obtain majorities.
   ``They are swimming against the tide of national politics,'' he
said.
   Mitchell, 55, of Maine, was elected Tuesday by the Democrats of
the next Senate, handily defeating rivals Daniel Inouye of Hawaii
and Bennett Johnston of Louisiana. Mitchell won 27 votes on the
first ballot, compared with only 14 each for the others, and he then
was declared the winner by acclamation.
   The former federal judge and prosecutor emerged from Tuesday's
secret meeting and sounded a tone of caution and compromise,
declaring that the Democrats would develop an agenda and ``wait with
interest and enthusiasm for the proposals of the next
administration.''
   ``We hope to move forward on a broad range of issues,'' he said,
citing the federal deficit, health care, day care and the
environment.
   Dole, R-Kan., a colleague of Mitchell's from the Senate Finance
Committee who was re-elected to his post by GOP colleagues on
Tuesday.
   ``I'll be able to work with George Mitchell,'' said Dole, ``He is
a very bright, able and articulate senator.''
   Mitchell received congratulatory telephone calls Tuesday from
President Reagan, President-elect George Bush, and Sen. Dan Quayle,
R-Ind., the vice-president elect. Mitchell and Bush discussed plans
to meet soon.
   As majority leader, Mitchell is in charge of the legislative
schedule, a power that will put him at the center of every important
issue. He'll bring to the role a far different style from that of
the man he's succeeding, Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Byrd, the Democrats' leader for the past decade, is known for his
intricate, behind-the-scenes legislative maneuvering. Mitchell is a
relative newcomer to the Senate _ he was first appointed in 1980 _
and is more comfortable on television and in public debate.
   His voting record received an 85 percent rating from the liberal
Americans for Democratic Action, compared to a 14 from the American
Conservative Union.
   Mitchell's opponents followed Senate courtesy after the election,
praising and defending the new leader.
   He will be ``a great spokesman'' who will put a personal stamp on
the Senate and help the party, predicted Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.,
who had supported Inouye.
   ``I think he'll do a competent job. He's judicious. I think he
will make a good spokesman, articulate, thoughtful,'' said Howell
Heflin, D-Ala., who supported Johnston.
   ``Whomsoever leads the party, I think is going to try to keep it
in the mainstream,'' said Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who was the
Democrats' vice presidential nominee.
   Bentsen's Texas colleague, Republican conservative Phil Gramm,
said the choice showed that the Democrats had not learned the lesson
of Michael Dukakis' losing candidacy.
   ``The fact that the only candidate who called himself a liberal,
that the only candidate from the Northeast won, is an indication
that the 1988 elections were not an aberration,'' he said. ``It
reflects the heart and soul of the Democratic Party.''
   Byrd steps down from his majority leader post to take the title
of president pro tempore of the Senate, a largely ceremonial post
which puts him third in succession to the presidency. The real plum
for Byrd is that he also will be chairman of the powerful Senate
Appropriations Committee, which approves spending by government
agencies.
   Both Inouye and Johnston will continue to be powerful senators,
with Inouye remaining as part of the leadership structure and
becoming chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee on
defense.

   Election-year political foes George Bush and
Jesse Jackson exchanged compliments today at the White House, and
Bush declared, ``This wasn't a bury the hatchet meeting because
there was no hatchet to bury.''
   He said the two men have a ``relationship that transcends
politics.''
   President-elect Bush, a Republican, and Jackson, who sought the
Democratic presidential nomination, had spoken critically of each
other during the long campaign.
   However, Bush said today, ``The campaign is over. I have no
arguments with the way that Rev. Jackson conducted himself toward
me.''
   ``There will be times ... when I will ask for his suggestions''
during the Bush administration, he said. ``He has some very good
ideas.''
   Bush said that the issue of Willie Horton, the murderer whose
furlough from a Massachusetts prison was used in GOP campaign ads,
came up during today's meeting and that he told Jackson he had not
intended to make it a racial issue.
   Jackson, asked how he felt about Bush's explanation, repeated his
view that the TV ads did incite racial fears, but said Bush had
assured him ``that was not his intention.''
   The Democrat said the most important aspect of the meeting was
the ``openness by President-elect Bush to discuss a broad range of
matters.''
   Earlier today, Bush met with leaders of environmental groups and
displayed an attitude that one of the leaders said showed a ``night
and day'' difference from the Reagan years.
   Spokesmen for the ``Blueprint for the Environment,'' a coalition
of some 30 environmental groups that presented Bush with detailed
proposals, were uniformly positive in characterizing Bush's response
to their goals.
   However, they acknowledged they had received no commitments from
him other than that he would consider their proposals and would
assign key Cabinet nominees to meet with them.
   One of the environmental groups' leaders, Jay Hair of the
National Wildlife Federation, said he had told the vice president,
``Mr. Bush, read my lips: Protect the environment.''
   Hair said Bush reacted positively to the wordplay on his own
no-taxes campaign phrase, replying, ``I will, I will.''
   John Adams, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council,
said that based on the positive reaction of Bush and his aides to
the group, ``it's hard to believe that President Bush will not
address these issues. We will be on his team.''
   Hair said ``it's simply night and day'' from the Reagan years
during which Bush served as vice president. Hair said the early
1980s were a time of ``ideological shrillness, anti-environmental
actions and lack of stewardship'' in the administration. ``I didn't
sense any of that this morning.''
   The leaders said Bush did not directly address their proposed $5
billion in increased spending on environmental programs, with
emphasis on actions to deal with a global warming trend, or the
total $19 billion in revenue increases that they proposed through a
combination of cutbacks and taxation measures.
   Bush did not meet with reporters after the session with the
environmental groups' leaders.
   His meetings with them and with Jackson are part of a
fence-mending effort that has included a session with vanquished GOP
rival Bob Dole and a planned meeting on Friday with Dukakis, the
defeated Democratic presidential nominee.
   Bush spokesman Steve Hart said the Jackson meeting was ``in
keeping with what George Bush has traditionally done, which is to be
open and talk to people that are interested and concerned.''
   In another overture to a prominent Democrat, Bush called the
Senate's newly chosen majority leader, George Mitchell of Maine, to
congratulate him shortly after Tuesday's secret-ballot election
among Senate Democrats.
   Also on Tuesday, Bush told Senate Republican leaders that he will
seek speedy confirmation of his Cabinet.
   Participants in a private meeting at the Capitol said Bush told
the senators he hopes any ``honeymoon period'' with Congress can
yield a federal budget compromise.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said Bush indicated he wanted to meet
with ``a bipartisan group to discuss his thoughts'' before
submitting a budget outline of his own.
   However, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee and the 1988 Democratic vice presidential
candidate, said Bush should send his own budget to the lawmakers.
   ``This will be his first test of leadership. He has to show what
he believes in _ national defense, Medicare, revenues? He has to
speak to the principal points of the budget. That's part of the
price of leadership,'' Bentsen said.

   A tax lawyer advised staffers of Lyndon H.
LaRouche Jr. to file federal tax returns even though it was not
clear that the law required LaRouche to, a witness at the political
maverick's conspiracy trial testified today.
   Richard Welsh, a LaRouche finance officer, said he met with the
tax lawyer to see whether LaRouche was obligated to file returns
even if he had no income and all his expenses were paid for by
organizations that were part of his political movement.
   Welsh told the jury he was told that the assistance to LaRouche
should be treated as ``ordinary business expenses'' by the companies
and not as LaRouche's personal income.
   A federal grand jury has charged that LaRouche conspired to
defraud the Internal Revenue Service by not declaring the personal
and household expenses he received as income and by not filing
federal income tax returns since 1979.
   Welsh said the tax lawyer ``recommended that a tax return be
filed, not because it was required'' but because LaRouche was ``a
controversial public figure'' and filing the returns ``would be kind
of a public relations act.''
   Welsh said the tax lawyer told LaRouche staffers ``it was a gray
area. It was not clear liability existed.''
   Welsh said that although returns were prepared after 1979 they
were not filed because they included only arbitrary estimates of the
amounts that could be attributed to LaRouche's personal and
household expenses.
   In earlier testimony, Welsh said LaRouche has been the ``leading
thinker'' for his politically extreme movement but never asserted
strong financial control over its operations.
   ``I don't recall him involved in day-to-day financial
operations,'' Welsh, a LaRouche financial official for 14 of his 15
years with the movement, said Tuesday, testifying under a grant of
immunity from prosecution.
   Welsh's testimony distancing LaRouche from his financial
operations could be crucial when jurors decide whether he and six
associates conspired to avoid repayment of loans the movement
received.
   That is the main charge against all seven defendants in the U.S.
District Court trial. LaRouche also is charged with conspiring to
defraud the Internal Revenue Service by failing to pay taxes after
1979.
   LaRouche showed little emotion as Welsh described the three-time
presidential candidate as ``the founder and leading thinker'' of the
movement, and ``the primary person who defines broad policies ...
general objectives and political goals.''
   The movement relies on conspiracy theories to explain world
events, and it often alleges that figures such as Henry Kissinger
and Queen Elizabeth participate in those conspiracies. LaRouche
backers, who advocate a quarantine for AIDS victims, also have been
accused of harboring anti-Semitic beliefs.
   While denying that LaRouche had a heavy hand over finances, Welsh
said those who did handle the books _ including himself _ had
launched an ambitious plan to straighten out the movement's
financial mess in 1986.
   The witness said the program, which he dubbed ``Project Apollo,''
came to a quick halt on Oct. 6, 1986, when federal and state law
enforcement authorities raided LaRouche's Leesburg, Va.,
headquarters and ``seized just about every scrap of paper having to
do with any financial record.''
   Welsh said the project was set up to either repay loans, convince
lenders to convert them to gifts, or persuade the contributors to
ease the terms of the loans.
   But he told jurors the raid wasn't the only development that
jolted the repayment plan.
   In April 1987, he related, the three main LaRouche organizations
that owed lenders money were placed in involuntary bankruptcy. The
federal government action froze the groups' ability to conduct any
financial transactions.
   To make matters more complicated, Welsh said, several banks froze
LaRouche organization accounts after it became public knowledge that
a federal grand jury in Boston was investigating the movement's
financial dealings in a separate case from the trial here.
   The grand jury indictment says more than $30 million in loans
were made to LaRouche organizations. Welsh said some $5 million were
repaid, adding that the indebtedness was reduced by $1.5 million
during Project Apollo before it was stopped.
   Under questioning from Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson,
Welsh said LaRouche was buying expensive Virginia properties at a
time when millions of dollars in loans went unpaid.
   Welsh said a LaRouche real estate company spent about $4 million
on land for a security training facility, for a summer camp for
children of LaRouche employees and a farm where LaRouche and his
wife, Helga, live when in the United States.
   During the same period, around May 1986, LaRouche wrote a woman
who was seeking repayment of nearly $113,000 in loans that she could
not be repaid because no discretionary funds were available.

   An Academy of Sciences report said 12
million Poles live in areas devastated by pollution and urged
tighter regulation to clean up what one scientist on Wednesday
called Europe's dirtiest country.
   Most beaches on the Baltic Sea have been closed, industrial waste
output increased by nearly half in the past five years, and most
Polish rivers lack drinkable water, according to the study published
in newspapers Wednesday.
   Poland ranks second in Europe in sulfur dioxide emissions, said
the report by the academy, the nation's most foremost research
institution.
   ``There has been a complete breakdown of the state of natural
balance in 27 areas'' inhabited by one-third of Poland's 38 million
people, the newspaper Zycie Warszawy said in its summary of the
report revealed during a Tuesday meeting of the academy's governing
presidium.
   The newspapers summarized the findings of a report, ``A Judgment
of Effectiveness and Directions of Action in the Field of Shaping
and Protecting the Environment,'' by the scientific committee ``Man
and Environment'' at the academy.
   The report assessed environmental protection policy over the last
20 years and criticized legislation, current solutions and lack of
public awareness about the threat.
   ``The analysis showed that actions currently being undertaken are
insufficient and have not restrained a permanent deterioration of
the environment,'' said geology professor Stefan Kozlowski,
secretary of the committee.
   ``It is an extremely urgent matter. It is getting worse day by
day. We are the dirtiest country in Europe,'' Kozlowski said in a
telephone interview.
   ``It should be called `Judgment of Ineffectiveness,' '' the
official communist party daily Trybuna Ludu said of the report.
   The report said economic losses stemming from environmental
problems were also huge, amounting to 10 percent of the country's
annual national revenue.
   An increase in disease resulted from the state of the
environment, the report said. It quoted a study of the carcinogenic
influence on living tissues of dusts in the air of the Silesia
region in southern Poland where the mining and metallurgy industries
are concentrated.
   ``Symptoms include cancerous processes or genetic deformations,''
it said.
   The communist government newspaper Rzeczpospolita suggested
increased enforcement of environmental laws and other legal remedies
should be used to improve the environment.
   ``One of the ways of acting is to pay more attention to
law-abidingness in the sphere of the natural environment,'' it said.
It also suggested passage of new laws, amendments and regulations.
   Trybuna Ludu said fines for environmental violations were too
small.
   In recent weeks, government officials have been expressing
increasing concern about the environment, and the newly appointed
government of Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has said that
addressing environmental problems will be a top priority.
   In one of its first acts, the government permitted the closing of
a chromium-producing factory near Wroclaw, in Silesia, for
environmental reasons.
   There is a budding independent environmental movement, with at
least two groups of activists _ Freedom and Peace and the Polish
Ecological Party. Activists welcomed the report.
   ``It's good that ecological losses are finally the subject of
public discussions. It's good that people are finally being made
aware of the situation. We've been saying that all the time,'' said
Freedom and Peace leader Jacek Czaputowicz.

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
declaring ``the campaign is over,'' sat down with Republican
counterpart Bob Dole on Wednesday to begin work on their legislative
agenda at the dawn of the Bush administration.
   Mitchell, elected leader of the Senate's 55 Democrats on Tuesday,
went to Dole's Capitol office for private discussions and a later
lunch with leaders of both parties.
   Mitchell, a liberal from Maine, played down his ideological
differences with the new Bush administration. ``The campaign is over
and we've got serious problems, important issues facing the
country,'' he told reporters.
   ``We look forward to cooperating,'' Mitchell said.
   Asked what advice he would have for President-elect Bush,
Mitchell said, ``I'm going to listen to him and try to be
accomodating to his concerns.''
   ``Clearly, the president-elect, having assumed the leadership of
the nation, will want to put forth his own ideas,'' Mitchell said.
``I think we should wait and see what the president-elect's plans
are.''
   Mitchell was also referring to the fiscal 1990 budget, which the
administration will send to the 101st Congress shortly after it
convenes next January.
   Dole, who was re-elected as Republican leader on Tuesday, said
Bush probably will wait until President Reagan formally proposes the
next budget before acting.
   ``The president-elect has a little problem,'' Dole, of Kansas,
said. ``He's not the president yet.''
   ``Perhaps what he may do is let the Reagan budget come up and
then submit some recommendations,'' Dole said. ``That makes sense.''
   However, Dole cautioned, ``we can't wait too long. The American
people want Bush to succeed, they want Mitchell to succeed.''
   But, Dole said, ``They don't want to wait much more than six or
seven months.''
   ``By custom, by tradition, by law and by common curtesy, he
should be allowed to set his agenda,'' Mitchell said of Bush.
   Meanwhile, Mitchell said, Senate Democrats are ``acting to
develop and identify our own agenda.''
   ``We anticipate there will be substantial overlap,'' he said,
citing mutual concerns over the deficit and other issues.
   Mitchell and Dole were joined by other party leaders elected
Tuesday for the lunch, which also included discussions of committee
assignments in the upcoming session. Later in the day, Mitchell was
calling on House Speaker Jim Wright, a fellow Democrat, to discuss
party issues and priorities.
   Meanwhle, four of the five new Democratic members of the Senate
met with reporters and with Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
   Kerry called the group's election ``an affirmation of basic
Democratic values'' by the voters, noting it was the first time in
50 years that the party winning the White House lost seats in the
House and Senate.
   ``If there is a mandate ... it is to deal with education, our
competitive posture, housing, health care and child care,'' Kerry
said, noting that those were issues that not only the Democrats, but
also the winning Republicans in this election, had run on.
   In one way or another, the four new Democrats _ Herb Kohl of
Wisconsin, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut
and Richard Bryan of Nevada _ repeated those themes as their
priorities in the 101st Congress.
   ``I won because I expressed the mainstream of the Democratic
Party,'' Lieberman said. ``I promised the people of Connecticut I
would fight for the things that matter to them and to their
families.''

<HEAD>U.S. Says Ceausescu Fails To Allay Fears About Village Razing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration said Wednesday that a
speech by Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu failed to ease fears
that the Bucharest government was going to raze thousands of
villages and force residents to move into ``sterile, regimented''
communities.
   ``The Romanian program of so-called `rural systemization' has
been a matter of serious concern to the United States, as well as to
a growing number of Western European governments, and even several
of Romania's neighbors,'' State Department spokesman Charles Redman
told reporters.
   Redman was commenting on a speech that Ceausescu gave on Monday
to the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee in which he
appeared to back away from the widely criticized plan that would
have razed as many as 7,000 villages.
   ``The U.S. has publicly and privately deplored this policy, which
is being carried out without apparent participation or consent of
the affected population, and we will continue to do so,'' Redman
said.
   The plan calls for the resettlement of residents of the razed
villages in new housing in agro-industrial centers.
   Western and Hungarian critics have said the plan threatens to
destroy the cultural traditions of 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in
Romania, as well as ethnic Germans and others.
   In his speech Ceausescu cited the need to preserve ``a number of
communes'' to prevent depopulation of the countryside.
   Redman said Ceausescu's speech ``sought to rationalize the policy
in terms of improved rural living standards and economic
efficiency.''
   ``However, it did nothing to allay widespread fears that the plan
is forcing large numbers of Romanians, of many ethnic origins, to
give up their traditional ways of life and cultural patterns to live
a sterile, regimented, economically unproductive existence,'' Redman
said.
   He said village destruction so far appeared to have occurred near
the capital of Bucharest and had yet to be extended to such areas as
Transylvania and Banat, where the ethnic German and Hungarian
populations are centered.

   Actor Alan Alda, who can be seen in commercials
promoting IBM computers, just bought a laptop model from the
competition, Toshiba.
   ``That was the machine that I recommended to him for his needs,''
said James Cosby of the Laptop Shop in Manhattan.
   According to Cosby, Alda entered the shop on Nov. 10, told Cosby
he had two desktop IBM computers, one at his Long Island home and
the other in his Beverly Hills place, and needed a compatible,
battery-operated laptop model.
   ``Sell me something,'' Cosby quoted Alda as saying.
   ``They (IBM) don't make what he wanted,'' said Alda spokesman
Martin Bregman. ``The bottom line is if IBM made it, he would have
gotten it for nothing.''
   IBM spokesman Bill Amana said Alda was ``free to choose whichever
product he wants.''
   Alda, who made his name as Hawkeye in the television series MASH,
declined to give an autograph to one of the saleswomen, Cosby said.
   ``He'll shake your hand, but he doesn't give autographs and I
respect him for that,'' Cosby said.

   Madame Tussaud's Waxworks is giving Michael Dukakis
a lesson in how fleeting fame can be.
   A wax image of the Democratic presidential candidate will be
taken down Dec. 9 after the shortest exhibition in the museum's
218-year history, officials said Wednesday.
   The Dukakis statue went on display next to a statue of
President-elect George Bush on Oct. 31, when Madame Tussaud's felt
the election was too close to call.
   It was the first time Madame Tussaud's had displayed both
American presidential candidates. In the previous three elections,
the museum correctly guessed the winner, said Juliet Simpkins, head
of publicity for the museum.
   The statue which holds the longevity record at Tussaud's is one
of Madame du Barry, one of the mistresses of Louis XVI. The head was
modeled in 1765, Ms. Simpkins said, and was one of the 35 original
figures Madame Tussaud inherited from her uncle.

   Mayor Sonny Bono says it's time for
the California Angels baseball team to decide if it wants to play
ball with city officials.
   The Angels, based in Anaheim, have used Palm Springs as their
home base for spring training since 1961. But the team, owned by
former movie cowboy Gene Autry, is being wooed by cities in Arizona.
   ``You guys better get your act together and let us know if you
are coming here,'' Bono told team officials at a meeting Tuesday.
   City officials want the Angels to commit to playing exhibition
games in Palm Springs for the next 15 years. In return, officials
say they will ask voters to approve a bond issue to either refurbish
the current stadium and workout complex or build a new one.
   Angels Director of Operations Kevin Uhlich said the team will not
decide whether to stay for another two to three weeks, while Autry
and his wife, Jackie, review other options.

   Robert Parker, the novelist who created the
fictional detective of ``Spenser For Hire'' fame, says he always
wanted to be legendary mystery writer Raymond Chandler. Now he has
the chance.
   Parker, whose 16 Spenser novels have brought him his own measure
of fame, has been hired to finish Chandler's book, ``The Poodle
Springs Story.''
   ``I grew up wanting to be Raymond Chandler,'' Parker said, ``and
now, in a sense, I am.''
   Parker will pick up where Chandler, who created ace detective
Philip Marlowe, left off: 12 pages into the story. He will be paid
more than $1 million to finish the book, according to Chandler's
estate.
   To prepare for his latest job, Parker said during a recent
interview that he has been rereading all of Chandler's novels, some
for the 10th or 12th time.
   ``It's an adventure for any writer to take on the completion of
the master's work,'' said Parker, who added he doesn't plan to
change the first 12 pages. ``The real trick will be, can I occupy
Raymond Chandler's point of view?''

which filed for bankruptcy.
   ``Here I am with a zoo on my hands,'' Miss Bardot, 54, said after
signing a contract allowing her to purchase the animals for $10,000.
   Despite driving rain and having to slosh through deep mud, Miss
Bardot visited the wolves and monkeys at the zoo 85 miles north of
Paris, calling their cages ``degrading places that shouldn't be

   ``The greatest challenge to democracy in Latin America lies not

key factor in the region's economic difficulties is the capital
drain and resulting fiscal sacrifice caused by mammoth long-term

<HEAD>Quayle: I Won't Be `Spear-Carrier' for Conservatives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, wooed by
members of his party's right wing since the election, said Wednesday
he won't be their ``so-called spear carrier'' in the Bush
administration.
   In a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press, Quayle
also hinted that he may spend more time than his predecessors in
presiding over the Senate, which is controlled by the Democrats.
   On a personal note, he said he had learned from the verbal gaffes
he committed during the campaign to curb a tendency toward talking
too much. ``Verbosity leads to unclear, inarticulate things,'' he
said.
   Quayle also said he would make no recommendation as to who should
replace him in the Senate, but he did not reject suggestions that he
favors Rep. Dan Coats, the former aide who represents his old
congressional district.
   His comments about the conservatives who have beaten a path to
his transition office were his strongest public rejection of the
notion that he would become a link between the Republican Party's
far right and the new administration. Quayle himself is an ardent
conservative who has largely supported Reagan administration
positions during his eight years in the Senate.
   ``I've worked with a number of conservatives in the past; a lot
of good friends are conservatives, but I'm not the point man for the
conservatives in this administration. ... You won't see me being the
so-called spear carrier for all the so-called conservative issues,''
Quayle said.
   He said ``there's not a penny's worth of difference in
philosophy'' between him and President-elect George Bush, who in the
past has been perceived as more moderate.
   Quayle also hinted that he may take a more active role in his
official capacity as president of the Senate, presiding over the
Democratic-controlled chamber more frequently.
   ``It's certainly an option,'' he said.
   The presiding officer has substantial discretion as to which
senator to recognize for the purpose of offering amendments, bills
and motions. Normally the chair is occupied by a member of the
majority party. A Republican in charge could spell contention
between Democrats and the administration.
   ``Clearly the constitutional role of being president of the
Senate is something I've got to sit down and decide on how I'm going
to allocate my time. ... There have been suggestions to me by many
that I consider spending more time in the Senate than my
predecessors have. I have not made a decision on that,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle said he and Bush have not spoken substantively about his
role in the administration, but he added that he wouldn't mind if he
has to spend time fulfilling largely ceremonial duties such as going
to state funerals.
   ``There is ceremony for the funerals, but you can also do a lot
of work. You can meet a lot of people. You can have some meetings
and you'd be surprised at the kind of information and contact that
is made beyond the ceremonial requirements,'' he said.
   He met Wednesday with retiring Indiana Gov. Robert D. Orr, a
Republican who will appoint Quayle's replacement in the Senate.
Quayle intends to resign effective Jan. 2 so his replacement can
have seniority over other incoming senators.
   Orr has not said whom he will appoint, and Quayle said he made no
recommendation to the governor. But he did not reject a reporter's
suggestion that he favors Coats, who was Quayle's district
representative in Fort Wayne, Ind., while Quayle was in the House
from 1976 to 1980.
   ``Obviously I think a lot of Dan Coats. He worked for me for four
years. He's been a very good congressman from my old congressional
district. He took my seat. We've had a long and strong personal and
professional relationship,'' Quayle said.
   He said the presidential campaign, during which he made a number
of celebrated gaffes and was besieged with questions about his
military service, academic record and personal life, made him ``a
stronger person.''
   ``I know my strengths better than when I started. I also know
probably some of the weaknesses and errors that I'll have to work
on,'' he said. He said that he is ``far more careful of what I say
today than six months ago.''
   ``I also try to discipline myself when I get into a situation ...
and I'm trying to think of the answer, instead of being verbose,
which is a tendency that I have, to be concise. Because verbosity
leads to unclear, inarticulate things.''

   Plainclothes deputies will be on the slopes
this winter, ready to arrest anyone caught skiing out-of-bounds.
   Such skiers ``will be taken to the jail and booked and we will
take their skis and poles as evidence of a crime,'' Summit County
Sheriff Delbert Ewoldt said Tuesday.
   Sixteen avalanche deaths have been reported in the last two
winters, and Ewoldt said he planned to strictly enforce the Colorado
Skier Safety Act in an effort to prevent further tragedy.
   Last year, Ewoldt's skiing deputies nabbed six violators. They
were not released from jail until they paid bail and each eventually
suffered the maximum penalty _ a fine of $300.
   Under the policy, deputies ski off-duty for no extra pay. Usually
one deputy skis while another prowls in a snowmobile.
   ``We ski alongside the boundaries,'' said Lt. James Doughty. ``We
have to observe the person going out of bounds.''
   Doughty said few skiers would stand a chance of eluding him.
   ``I had the snowmobile clock me,'' Doughty said. ``I was doing 50
mph.''

<TEXT>
   Contributions to the Rev. Jerry Falwell's
``Old-Time Gospel Hour'' have dropped by more than $10 million and
the ministry's net worth has fallen by nearly $5 million from last
year, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for Falwell, said the organization is
deliberately moving away from dependence on direct public
contributions and said revenues have increased almost $3 million.
   The Lynchburg News & Daily Advance, citing the latest available
tax records, reported that for the fiscal year ending June 30,
public contributions to the Old-Time Gospel Hour totaled $40.7
million, the lowest level since the 1981-82 fiscal year.
   ``We have made a conscious effort in the past year to look for
other sources of income, realizing that contributions can and will
drop depending on climate of the country,'' DeMoss said.
   Combined with indirect public support, which DeMoss said included
deferred giving, estate planning and grants, total contributions
were $44.2 million, comparable with 1985-86 levels. The ministry's
total revenues increased from $60.9 million in 1986-87 to $63.7
million in 1987-88, he said.
   ``While contributions may drop in a given year, we feel like we
can maintain a pretty stable bottom line, which we're most concerned
with,'' DeMoss said. ``The key thing is that even though direct
public support dropped by as much as $10 million, total revenues are
up. As far as we're concerned and as far as any business or company
would be concerned, the bottom line is the bottom line. And that's
encouraging.''
   DeMoss said separate sex scandals involving former PTL leader Jim
Bakker and television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart may have contributed
to the decline in contributions.
   ``I think we'd be a lot more concerned about a bottom line drop
of $10 million than we are about a difference in contributions,'' he
said. ``We are prepared and preparing for the possibility that
contributions may be harder to come by year after year and we need
other income sources.''
   The newspaper said records also show Falwell, as president of the
televised Gospel Hour, received a $25,000 raise, bringing his annual
salary to $125,000. He also continued to receive $33,000 in benefits
from the ministry.

   A court found a U.S.-born Jewish settler guilty
of manslaughter Wednesday in the shooting death of an Arab shepherd,
the first such conviction of an Israeli in the nearly yearlong
Palestinian uprising.
   Five Palestinians were reported shot in clashes with soldiers in
the occupied territories, hospital officials said.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, two firebombs were thrown at the U.S.
Consulate but caused no damage or injuries, consulate spokesman
David Good said.
   Good said the two gasoline-filled bottles were tossed over a
surrounding wall and hit the side of the building. But the firebombs
burned out harmlessly, he said.
   The settler, Israel Zeev, 38, was found guilty in Jerusalem
District Court for the May 5 shooting death of 28-year-old Jude
Abdallah Awad in a field near the Jewish settlement of Shillo in the
West Bank.
   Another Palestinian was wounded.
   Zeev, who claimed he fired in self-defense after the shepherds
threw stones, could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.
   Yakov Weinrott, Zeev's attorney, said he probably would appeal
the verdict but would wait until after the sentencing Sunday to make
a decision.
   A relative who asked not to be identified said that Zeev was
raised in Chicago and is the father of six children.
   The May 5 incident began when a Jewish woman spotted several Arab
shepherds in a field between the Arab village of Turmus Aiya and
Shillo, 18 miles north of Jerusalem.
   She called for help, and Zeev came and fired at the shepherds.
Witnesses told reporters that Zeev fired without provocation. They
said the victim knew Zeev and shouted, ``Israel, don't shoot.''
   District Judge Tzvi Cohen was quoted on Israel radio as saying
``reality is not a Western'' and concluding that ``Israel Zeev had
to know there's a possibility of somebody getting hurt when he fired
from the hip.''
   At least 316 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been reported
killed in the uprising since it began Dec. 8, 1987. It is not known
how many victims may have died from civilian gunfire.
   Pinhas Wallerstein, a Jewish settler leader, is still being tried
in the slaying of a 17-year-old Palestinian in January.
   Police recommended last week that Rabbi Moshe Levinger, a founder
of the settlement movement, be tried in the shooting death of a
shopkeeper during a Sept. 30 stone-throwing clash. No action has
been taken.
   Leaders of the settlement movement, meanwhile, called on the army
to take harsher steps against Arab rioters.
   ``It seems to me we have a war going on here, but it is being
treated like a demonstration,'' said Haim Granit, a brigadier
general in the reserve army who lives in the West Bank settlement of
Elkana.
   The group urged the deportation of Palestinians caught throwing
stones and a ban on employment of anyone arrested for protests.
   About 1.5 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Middle East war.
   On Wednesday, troops shot and wounded five Palestinians in
stone-throwing clashes in the occupied areas, Arab hospital
officials said.
   The army confirmed that one person was wounded in the West Bank
refugee camp of El Ain near Nablus, and said it was checking the
other reports.
   Also Wednesday, police released three Israelis suspected of
setting a fire that burned three Arab laborers to death as they
slept in a shack near Tel Aviv in August.
   Police freed the suspects after holding them for 90 days. Israeli
radio said police did not have enough evidence to bring charges.

   Charities are having a tough time this year
hiring the bell ringers so familiar to holiday shoppers, in part
because the economy is strong.
   ``It's ironic, but when the national economy is better we have
trouble in two ways _ finding people willing to ring bells at
minimum wages and discovering that donors tend to give less,'' said
Titus Herman, a spokesman for the Salvation Army.
   The Salvation Army and Volunteers of America both depend on bell
ringers to solicit change from holiday shoppers. Volunteers, often
local celebrities and members of service clubs, help out in short
stints, but the paid ringers handle most of the work.
   Herman said the Salvation Army usually employs about 175 bell
ringers in Portland. It is short at least 67 ringers this year.
   Lisa Crawford of the Volunteers of America said she had enough
ringers to cover downtown Portland, but it had been difficult to
find people for work in the suburbs, even when bus transportation
was offered.
   ``I could use five or 10 more, but I can't find them,'' Crawford
said.
   Groups in other states also were encountering similar problems.
   Joy Buersmeyer, business manager for the Salvation Army in Boise,
Idaho, said a shortage of ringers was made worse due to competition
from businesses for people willing to work at minimum wage.
   Jim Grassley, Salvation Army spokesman in Seattle, said it was
``touch and go'' finding enough for-hire bell ringers.
   ``There is a concern finding people reliable enough and
trustworthy enough to stand there and ring bells,'' Grassley said.
``It's a tough job, but the kettles are important both for the
dollars they raise and as a silent reminder that someone is out
there trying to do something to help others; showing that someone
cares.''

<HEAD>Firing Of Southern Baptist Ministers On The Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANDERSON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bad communication with congregations and
pastoral immorality have led an increasing number of Southern
Baptist churches to fire their ministers, denomination officials say.
   A recent survey found that each month an average of 116 of the
approximately 37,000 churches in the Southern Baptist Convention
fire their pastors, said Norris Smith, the forced-termination
consultant for the Southern Baptist Sunday School Board.
   Other reasons given for the firings, which are up 31 percent over
a 1984 survey, were performance dissatisfaction, power struggles and
personality clashes, he said.
   Smith said he was surprised to find that the controversy in the
Southern Baptist Convention between moderates and conservatives was
not a big factor.
   Smith said that in many denominations, a pastor who is having a
problem can be transferred to a more receptive parish by the
denomination's hierarchy. But Baptist congregations hire and fire
their own pastors.
   The 1984 study, done by the Southern Baptist Convention's Sunday
School Board, surveyed only fired ministers. Smith's survey
interviewed directors of missions, who in the Southern Baptist
denomination may direct mission work in several churches in an area
and frequently are called on to mediate church controversies.
   A lack of communication between the pastor and church leaders was
cited in 13.4 percent of the firings, the most frequent reason given
by directors of missions for forced terminations. Smith said both
sides usually communicated poorly and lacked systems to deal with
conflict.
   Immorality was the primary cause in 12.9 percent of forced
terminations. That category included sexual immorality, theft or
mismanagement of church money and problems of personal integrity.
   Smith said various subjective reasons accounted for 44.6 percent
of the terminations.
   Details of the survey were reported by the Baptist Press, the
convention's news service.

<NOTE>Eds: Changes ``remote AP cameras'' to ``remote cameras'' in lead

<TEXT>
   The Associated Press and The New York
Times rejected on Wednesday a Defense Department demand that
military officials be granted the right to confiscate film from
remote cameras in the event of an accident during the launching of
the space shuttle Atlantis on a secret military mission.
   As a result, they were denied permission to install remote
cameras in an area near the launch pad to take closeup pictures of
the liftoff, which is scheduled for Thursday.
   Some other news organizations accepted the Pentagon requirement
under protest, and were allowed to place their cameras in sites near
the launch pad.
   Atlantis' five-man crew reportedly is to deploy a top-secret spy
satellite, and the Defense Department and NASA have placed a secrecy
veil over most details about the mission.
   On Wednesday, hours before representatives of news organizations
were to be taken to remote sites to set up their cameras, the Air
Force asked each to sign an ``Agreement on Placement of Remote
Camera.''
   The agreement said, in part:
   ``I understand that the mission ... is classified. Therefore, in
consideration of permission to place cameras as requested, I agree
that should an on-pad accident or other event create a risk that
classified material might be exposed to view, representatives of DOD
may retrieve the film from my cameras, process it and review it to
determine if any classified information is revealed or compromised.
   ``I understand that any film which is determined by DOD to reveal
or compromise classified information will be retained by DOD, but
all other film will be returned to me as quickly as possible.''
   Harold G. Buell, the AP's assistant general manager for news
photos, said the Pentagon demand was an unacceptable intrusion on
coverage of the space shot. He said agreements made with NASA after
the Challenger disaster covered the situation.
   ``We have no intention of acquiescing in the kind of military
censorship the Air Force seeks,'' Buell said.
   He noted that the government has cameras in identical remote
positions, could determine immediately should the photographs
disclose secrets that would harm national security, and thus could
seek withholding of such photographs if the need arose.
   ``That would protect classified information,'' Buell said.
``Asking news organizations in advance to agree to give their film
to the government is not the way to do it.''
   Carolyn Lee, picture editor of The New York Times, said the Times
refused to sign the agreement and also was denied the use of remote
cameras.
   The AP had planned to set up eight remote cameras in a security
area ranging from about 1,500 feet to 2,500 feet from the launch
pad. They are activated by the sound of the shuttle lifting off.
   Under normal circumstances, news organizations are able to
retrieve their film about 3{ hours after launch. The photos capture
only the first few seconds of the flight.
   News agency photographers also take pictures of the launch from a
press site four miles from the pad and from various locations
outside the Kennedy Space Center.
   News groups never had a problem with their remote cameras until
the Challenger explosion 73 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The cameras did not photograph the explosion, but NASA officials
felt the pictures might offer some clue to what went wrong. They
confiscated news agency remote film and turned it over to a team
investigating the accident. After protests from the news groups, the
film was returned several days later.
   Following that incident, NASA and the news groups signed an
agreement that, no matter what happened on launch, the groups would
have normal access to the remote camera film, turning it over to
NASA investigators only after using the material they needed.
Eventually, the agencies would get their film back.
   But with Atlantis carrying a secret payload, the Defense
Department, through the Air Force, insisted on authority to
confiscate any film that might expose classified material.

   Ethnic clashes between Azerbaijanis and Armenians
killed 11 people, including a Moslem mullah, raising the death toll
in more than a week of violence to at least 18, official media
reported Wednesday.
   The report by the official Armenian news agency Armenpress that
10 Azerbaijanis and one Armenian had been killed threaten to raise
tension even higher in the southern Soviet region where many cities
already are under military rule and strict curfews.
   The Armenian capital of Yerevan and the Azerbaijani capital of
Baku, both under military rule, were reported to be tense but calm.
Official media in both cities reported thousands of refugees were
streaming across the border to their ethnic homelands.
   Leon Azruyan, the night editor in charge of the Armenpress news
agency, said in a telephone interview that the deaths announced by
officials Wednesday included people killed in clashes in several
Armenian cities between Nov. 22-29.
   An Azerbaijani mullah fired into a large open meeting of
Armenians in the city of Kalinino in far northern Armenia late last
week, ``but they threw stones at him. One hit him in the head and
killed him,'' Azruyan said.
   One Armenian was killed in the city of Goris in southeastern
Armenia near the Azerbaijani border when attackers fired into a
similar crowd, he said.
   Two people were seriously wounded and the attackers slipped away,
Azruyan said.
   He said other deaths occurred in the cities of Kirovakan,
Krasnoselsk and Spitak in northern Armenia, but that there was no
detailed information on how many died in each city, or what the
circumstances were.
   They were the first deaths reported in Armenia in the recent wave
of violence. Four soldiers were killed protecting Armenian residents
of the Azerbaijani city of Kirovabad, and soldiers shot and killed
three civilians there for violating curfew. Violence also was
reported in Nakhichevan, an Azerbaijani enclave situated between
Armenia and the Iranian border.
   Trouble began in the Caucasus republics in February when the
predominantly Armenian population of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of
Azerbaijan began calling for annexation of the area by Armenia.
   Azerbaijan and the central Soviet government have rejected
annexation.
   Mass demonstrations followed in Armenia, and at the end of
February ethnic rioting broke out in the Azerbaijani city of
Sumgait, killing at least 32 people.
   The area has remained tense since then, and the latest unrest
began in mid-November. Azerbaijanis accused Armenia of sending
settlers into Nagorno-Karabakh to pad the Armenian majority there,
of forcing Azerbaijanis out of work, and refusing them food and
medical supplies.
   In Moscow, at a meeting of the Supreme Soviet parliament that is
considering a reform of the political structure, Armenian President
Grant Voskanyan chastised his Azerbaijani counterpart, Suleiman
Tatev, for what he said was Azerbaijan's unwillingness to compromise.
   ``He is categorically rejecting any possibility of a
compromise,'' Voskanyan said. ``If the Azerbaijani leaders showed
the political maturity to condemn the crimes in Sumgait as crimes
against nature, then there would not have been a Kirovabad and
Nakhichevan.''
   Official Yerevan radio, in a report monitored in London by the
British Broadcasting Corp., said more than 20,000 ethnic Armenian
refugees from Azerbaijan had arrived since Nov. 22.
   It said many had arrived in Armenia without clothing, money, or
documents, and in need of medical treatment. It said empty houses
had been requisitioned to shelter them, and appealed to Yerevan
residents to help care for the refugees.
   Official sources in Azerbaijan reported that thousands of
Azerbaijanis had arrived there from Armenia. They said meetings and
protests wer e going on despite the military rule, but that the
situation was returning to normal.

<HEAD>Summit to Review Progress Toward Single Market</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the 12 European Economic
Community nations meet this week to review progress toward their
ambitious goal of forging a single-market EEC by the end of 1992.
   The two-day summit in Greece that starts Friday is the first
since British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told her partners in
September that she can never accept a United States of Europe.
   Mrs. Thatcher favors removing barriers hampering free trade but
wants EEC borders to remain for security reasons. She does not want
a single market to lead to a monetary union with a single currency
and a central EEC bank after 1992.
   But French President Francois Mitterrand, West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and her nine other partners say the EEC must precisely
go down that road if it is to compete effectively with Japan and the
United States.
   The single market plan has also worried the EEC's two main
trading partners.
   Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Theodore Pangalos said the meeting
on the resort island of Rhodes will reassure Washington and Tokyo
that Europe won't turn protectionist.
   ``The spirit in which the (draft summit) declaration has been
formulated will have the effect of reassuring these unjustifiable
fears'' of a `Fortress Europe,' Pangalos said this week.
   The leaders will also review East-West relations and the Middle
East situation after the Nov. 15 declaration of the Palestine
National Council, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile, proclaiming
an independent Palestine.
   Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, the summit chairman, may
ask the EEC leaders to meet with Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat. Greece has suggested an EEC-Arafat meeting
before, but to no avail.
   Last week the EEC nations welcomed the council's implicit
recognition of Israel, called for an international Middle East peace
conference but stopped short of recognizing the Palestinian state on
Israeli-occupied territories.
   Jacques Delors, president of the EEC executive commission, said
the summit must produce ``a major initiative'' on East-West
relations to coordinate efforts by EEC nations to extend trade
credit to the Soviet Union.
   In recent weeks, several EEC nations, including West Germany,
have granted some $8 billion in such credit to Moscow.
   Mrs. Thatcher goes to Rhodes pleased that her Sept. 20 bombshell
speech in Bruges, Belgium, launched a debate about the future of the
EEC, aides said.
   Delors said if Britain does not fall into line, its partners may
go it alone in creating a monetary union. He told the European
Parliament this month there was ``a deep political disagreement''
over the future of the EEC.
   ``I cannot exclude a crisis,'' Delors said on British television
this week.
   The summit will assess progress to date in creating a single
market, officials said. Such a market is said to boost economic
growth in the EEC by 5 percent, lower prices by 6 percent and create
some 2 million jobs.
   Under a 1985 treaty, this requires adopting 279 EEC laws, 40
percent of which have already been enacted.
   Among the proposed laws is a bid to harmonize value added taxes.
   Britain and Denmark oppose a proposal for two bands of VAT rates,
from 4 percent to 9 percent for some goods and from 14 percent to 19
percent for others. Britain sees VAT on food and children's clothing
as politically unattractive and heavily taxed Denmark fears a loss
of revenue and believes taxes on alcohol and tobacco must remain
high for health reasons.
   Mrs. Thatcher, facing a persistent terrorism problem in Northern
Ireland, is adamant that border checks can be abolished for goods
and services but, for security reasons, must remain for travelers.
   Pangalos said Greece will also guide the summit to discuss ways
of establishing EEC-wide social policies dealing with, among others,
workers' rights. This includes creation of a European company
statute that provides for worker participation in management, an
issue Mrs. Thatcher opposes.

   The U.S. Patent office indicated the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology will receive a patent on a process for
making flexible ceramic superconductors, moving superconductor
technology closer to the marketplace, MIT officials said Wednesday.
   The Patent Office issued a ``notice of allowability'' last week,
signaling it will award the patent within a few months, said John T.
Preston, director of MIT's technology licensing office.
   Preston said MIT has licensed exclusive rights to the patent to a
company founded last year by four of the institute's faculty
members. MIT officials refused to disclose the terms of the
licensing agreement with the company, American Superconductor Corp.
of Cambridge.
   Ever since two researchers at an International Business Machines
Inc. laboratory in Switzerland discovered ceramic superconductors in
January 1986, scientists around the world have been racing to
develop and apply the new materials. The IBM researchers, Georg
Bednorz and Alexander Mueller, won the 1987 Nobel Prize in physics
for their discovery.
   The advantage of ceramics is that they attain superconductivity,
the ability to conduct electricity with virtually no resistance or
energy loss, when cooled with liquid nitrogen to about 300 degrees
below zero Fahrenheit.
   Previous superconductors had operated at no higher than 418
degrees Fahrenheit, requiring cooling in liquid helium, which is
more expensive and difficult to handle than liquid nitrogen.
   Eventually, scientists hope to develop superconductors that will
work at room temperature, which could revolutionize the computer,
transportation and power transmission industries.
   A major stumbling block is that the materials developed so far
are brittle and tend to break when wrapped into coils or pressed
into sheets.
   MIT's process combines the ceramic superconductors with a noble
metal, such as silver, gold, platinum or palladium, forming a
composite that is relatively flexible. In addition, MIT officials
said, the composite is more resistant to oxidation and more easily
connected to sources of electricity than previous materials.
   The process was developed by MIT professors Gregory J. Yurek and
John B. Vander Sande, two of the founders of American Superconductor
Corp. Yurek said in an interview that the company plans to enter
joint ventures with corporate partners in a wide range of industries
to explore commercial uses as soon as possible.
   While the earliest practical applications are probably five years
away, Yurek said, ``there's no doubt these materials are going to
have a very large impact on society.''
   He predicted that the first uses would be in computer shielding,
small motors and satellite sensing devices, but that later
applications would be more diverse.
   ``We're talking about powerful desktop computers, medical
imaging, geological exploration, power transmission,
transportation,'' he said. ``Even the popular idea of levitating
trains is not unrealistic _ it will in fact happen.''

   Former Sen. John G. Tower, the leading
candidate to be the new secretary of defense, works as a consultant
for five major defense firms, congressional records and a Tower
associate said Wednesday.
   The companies, which include some of the nation's largest defense
contractors, build an array of weapons ranging from nuclear-tipped
missiles to airplanes.
   Before retiring from the Senate in 1985, Tower was chairman of
the Armed Services Committee, a post in which he oversaw Pentagon
spending. During his 24 years as a senator, he was a strong
supporter of a variety of weapons, including those built by the five
companies.
   Tower did not return telephone calls Wednesday, but Richard
Billmire, a Tower associate, said the former senator was on an
annual retainer from Martin-Marietta, Textron, LTV Aerospace and
Defense Co., Rockwell International, and British Aerospace.
   Tower & Associates, the consulting firm formed by Tower,
registered with Congress last Feb. 2 as a lobbyist, according to
Senate records.
   According to Billmire, Tower registered as a lobbyist because he
had been asked by the White House to help lobby the Senate for
approval of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty.
Tower would not be required to register as a lobbyist in his
capacity as a consultant for the defense companies unless he lobbied
Congress on their behalf.
   Billmire, who works for Tower & Associates, said, ``We registered
because the White House asked for our help on the INF treaty and we
were working as consultants for these companies at the same time.
The companies make some components which go into systems that are
used for weapons affected by the treaty.''
   ``Tower wanted to be absolutely clear and up front about his
connections with the companies and he didn't want anybody saying
that the reason Tower was saying this or that about the treaty was
because it would have helped one of his clients,'' Billmire said.
   After retiring from the Senate, Tower was named by President
Reagan as a member of the U.S. team negotiating with the Soviets for
deep reductions in the U.S. and Soviet arsenals of long-range
weapons.
   After resigning that post, the former senator formed Tower &
Associates.
   Billmire declined to say what the firm was paid by the five
companies. But Tower might be expected to have received more than
$50,000 annually from each, according to a defense contractor who
spoke Wednesday on condition he not be named.
   Tower is also a member of the board of directors of the U.S.
subsidiary of British Aerospace.
   His work for the five firms was first revealed by New York
Newsday.
   Tower remains the leading candidate to become secretary of
defense in a Bush administration and has met several times with
President-elect George Bush, sources said Wednesday.
   Although Bush is expected to name Tower, the public announcement
is being delayed while representatives of the two men negotiate over
who might be named to other Pentagon jobs, said the sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity.

   Despite threatening weather, NASA
pressed ahead today toward a Thursday launching of Atlantis' secret
satellite mission, but a new problem cropped up _ two stripped bolts
on the spaceship.
   The space agency reported that the 21-man Mission Management Team
decided during an afternoon meeting to proceed with the countdown
even though weather officials were reporting that an advancing storm
reduced the odds of launch to one in five.
   Another look would be made at the weather before technicians
began fueling the shuttle's fuel tanks late tonight.
   Meanwhile, NASA said that two bolts had been broken on a panel
that allows technicans access to a cluster of small jet engines used
to steer the shuttle in orbit. A statement said the bolts were
broken during installation of the panel.
   The panel, in front of the crew cabin, is covered by 12
protective thermal tiles.
   ``This panel is being bonded in place and managers will have
indications of the integrity of the bond by early evening,'' the
NASA statement said.
   A source who requested anonimity said that if the bond did not
hold, the launch might have to be postponed a day or two while other
corrective measures were taken.
   NASA does not want to fly the shuttle if there is a chance the
panel could fall off. If it did, re-entry heat could destroy exposed
systems and possibly lead to severe shuttle damage and possible
danger to the crew.
   A leaking tire on the shuttle's main landing gear was a less
bothersome concern.
   The management team met to assess the worsening weather forecast,
which called for winds up to 24 mph, heavy clouds and the
possibility of light rain at the planned launch time. The problem
with the bolts surfaced during this meeting.
   Because all details of the flight are classified, NASA has said
only that the planned launch time was between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32
a.m. Sources said liftoff was set for about 7 a.m.
   Capt. Ken Warren, an Air Force spokesman, said the biggest
problem was a prediction of a heavy cloud layer over the runway here
where Atlantis would land if there were an emergency shortly after
liftoff.
   ``It is not looking very good for a return-to-launch-site
abort,'' Warren said.
   Mission rules call for a cloud ceiling above 8,000 feet over the
runway. The forecast is for 4,000 feet. Strong crosswinds also could
be a deterrent, Warren said.
   Warren said the weather odds for a launch itself were 60 percent.
But they dropped to 20 percent with the emergency landing
requirements factored in.
   The problem was a cold front carrying thunderstorms stretching
from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast which Warren said should
reach the Cape Canaveral area early Thursday.
   If the forecast apeared hopeless, launch managers most likely
would delay the liftoff before technicians start pumping more than
half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into
Atlantis' external fuel tank. That was scheduled to start late
tonight.
   At the launch pad, NASA reported the countdown was on schedule.
Early today the clock was stopped for a planned 16 hour, 20 minute
hold at the 11-hour mark. The hold provides time for contingency
catchup and to provide rest for members of the launch team.
   The military astronauts were to be kept up to date on the weather
today during a series of briefings on the status of their spaceship,
flight operations and the secret Defense Department satellite.
   Atlantis will be commanded by Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson. The
pilot is Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner, and the mission
specialists are Col. Richard M. Mullane and Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross
of the Air Force and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.
   Sources report the $500 million Lacrosse satellite will obtain
all-weather, high-resolution radar images of military targets in
Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and elsewhere in the world and
eventually will serve as a radar ``eye'' to guide America's B-2
stealth bomber.
   Following a meeting Tuesday, the management team headed by
astronaut Bob Crippen said preparations for launch were ``going very
well,'' but added it was closely watching the weather.
   Strict weather limits have been imposed in the wake of the
Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts shortly after
launch on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The rules include winds of no more than 19 mph from the south or
28 mph from any direction, no rain at the pad or in the flight path
and no thunderstorms within five miles.
   The managers also said in their brief statement that they weren't
concerned about the tiny landing-gear leak, which technicians have
been monitoring for weeks. But sources said that if the launch is
delayed a week, the shuttle would have to be rolled back to a hangar
for a tire replacement, a move that could delay the flight several
weeks.
   Because of the classified nature of the mission, precise details
of the countdown are not being disclosed.
   There also will be a news blackout once Atlantis is in orbit. The
silence will be broken only if there is a major problem.
   The Pentagon said the secrecy is necessary to make it more
difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships prowling off Cape
Canaveral to learn about the satellite's mission.
   However, the Soviets, through the Tass news agency, have said the
satellite will spy on the Soviet Union and serve as the radar watch
for the stealth bomber.

   George Bush's chief recruiter assured the
public Wednesday that the new president won't bring ``armies and
legions of political hacks'' with him when he takes the reins of
government next month.
   Even if Bush were inclined to dispense patronage that way, there
simply aren't that many openings in high places, transition
personnel chief Chase Untermeyer said.
   Untermeyer also predicted ``it may take longer to fill positions
in this administration than ever before'' because of the extensive
financial and security clearances required.
   There are 4,307 full-time political jobs in the government, but
Bush will not get to fill them all next year, Untermeyer said at a
news conference.
   Many Reagan appointees who have already been asked to submit
their resignations will not be tossed out on the street come Jan.
20, he said.
   Instead, the president-elect wants most to stay on until his
headhunters complete the task of finding all the ``fresh faces''
that Bush has promised to bring to Washington, Untermeyer said.
   Eventually, most of the holdovers will get their walking papers.
   ``This is not Ronald Reagan's third term. It will be George
Bush's first term,'' said Untermeyer, 42, a former assistant Navy
secretary for manpower.
   Untermeyer, whom Bush has already said will be his White House
personnel chief, sought to dispel the notion that the patronage
possibilities for the new president are boundless.
   He said political appointees comprised only 0.0014 percent of the
government's civilian work force, or ``one-seventh of 1 percent.''
   ``This I think would surprise a lot of people who imagine that
when any new administration comes in line, that there are armies and
legions of political hacks who are ready to take over all the
federal agencies around the nation and the world,'' he said.
   ``The four-star, main line jobs'' that require Senate
confirmation pay salaries that start at $80,000 and reach $99,500
for Cabinet officers.
   Also on Wednesday, four persons were named as the transition
office contacts for three departments and the Veterans
Administration. They are:
   _Energy Department, B. Reid Detchon, 40, a Bush speechwriter.
   _Health and Human Services Department, Margaret D. Garikes, 29, a
campaign policy analyst and former trial attorney for the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.
   _Labor Department, Richard W. Porter, 29, a campaign domestic
policy analyst and former lawyer-economist for the Chicago
consulting firm of Lexecon, Inc.
   _Veterans Administration, retired Air Force Col. Antonio Lopez,
54, a campaign deputy research director.
   By Untermeyer's count, there are a total of 5,807 political
appointments if Bush does not expand the ``Schedule C'' appointees
to Cabinet departments and agencies beyond the current 1,601.
   The 5,807 jobs include a maximum of 691 Senior Executive Service
slots for political appointees.
   But 1,600 of them are part-time appointments to boards and
commissions, many of them prestigious but not highly remunerative.
   And not all of the 4,307 full-time political appointments will
come open next year.
   They include the 860 federal judges, who are appointed for life
and usually turn over at the rate of 56 a year; 135 ambassadorships,
only about 50 of which are usually given to non-career Foreign
Service officers, and 138 regulatory agency chiefs, about 35 of whom
are chosen each year.
   Untermeyer acknowledged that apart from the high-level transition
officials gathering names and preparing lists of people for Bush to
choose, the president-elect's son, George Jr., was heading a
separate screening team looking out for the interests of longtime
Bush loyalists.
   He said that back in 1981, in the early days of the Reagan
administration, it became apparent that ``some of the spear
carriers, the people who'd worked precincts or driven cars for the
candidate or done all the usual dirty fingernail work of politics
were not being thought of.''
   ``There are such people in every campaign. There certainly are
people in the world of George Bush,'' said Untermeyer. The
president-elect ``got where he is retail, by remembering people one
at a time and we don't aim to forget them.''
   That doesn't mean jobs for all of them, he added. Some will wind
up on ``invitation lists to events at the White House'' or ``the
Christmas card list.''

<TEXT>
   A campaign to reopen the case of four Irish people
serving life terms for bombings in Britain got a boost Wednesday
when two senior retired judges published an attack criticizing their
convictions.
   In a full-page article in the Times of London, Lords Devlin and
Scarman said evidence that surfaced since the trial of the
``Guildford Four'' should be heard by a jury, including testimony by
two IRA men who claimed they were responsible.
   Instead, an Appeals Court judge rejected the evidence and denied
a retrial.
   ``Our constitutional law on which our freedoms depend has been
disordered,'' wrote Devlin and Scarman, former Law Lords who
constitute the highest court in Britain.
   An array of public figures including lawmakers, newspapers,
former government ministers and the heads of both the Anglican and
Roman Catholic churches in Britain have called for a retrial or
outright acquittal.
   The case could have implications for joint Anglo-Irish attempts
to combat the Irish Republican Army. It comes amid persistent
complaints that British courts are biased against Irish suspects,
and at a time when the two countries are again quarreling over the
extradition of IRA suspects to Britain.
   The convictions under criticism are those of Carole Richardson,
29; Patrick Armstrong, 36; Paul Hill, 34; and Gerry Conlon, 33.
   On Oct. 22, 1975, after a five-week trial, London's Old Bailey
Central Criminal Court jailed them for life for IRA bombings a year
earlier at two pubs at Guildford, 30 miles southwest of London. Five
people were killed in one pubs while the other was evacuated in time.
   Armstrong and Hill received additional life terms at the same
trial for an IRA bombing Nov. 7, 1974, at a pub at Woolwich in
southeast London in which two people died.
   The pubs were all frequented by soldiers _ the IRA's prime target
in its war to rid Northern Ireland of British rule and unite it with
the Irish Republic.
   In 1977 the Appeal Court rejected the plea of innocence of the
Guildford Four. But in 1986, former Home Secretary Merlyn Rees
publicly questioned the convictions, and last year an all-party
delegation of legislators called for a review of the case.
   They argue the convictions were based solely on confessions that
may have been extracted with beatings and drugs. They also said two
IRA men convicted in another case, Joe O'Connell and Brendan Dowd,
claimed after the trial that they carried out the bombings and had
never heard of the Guildford Four; and that at least one of the four
had an alibi.
   Scarman and Devlin reasoned that since the Appeals Court does not
have juries, the Guildford Four could not have the confession of
O'Connell and Dowd weighed by a jury, as should have been their
right.
   ``Were they (O'Connell and Dowd) lying? ... That was a question
for a jury as it certainly would have been if the evidence had been

   They did not criticize the trial procedures, saying the judge and
jury behaved scrupulously, and they did not say whether they
supported outright acquittal or a retrial.

   The post office on Wednesday kicked off its
annual ``Miracle on 34th Street,'' seeking answers to an expected
18,000 letters to Santa from the less fortunate around the world.
   While Christmas for some children means asking Santa Claus for
new toys and games, for poor children it often means asking forrs surveyed
believed
that 5 percent of less of their cases were dismissed because of
problems involving Miranda _ the requirement, fashioned in a 1966
Supreme Court ruling, that the police must warn suspects of their
right to remain silent and to consult with a lawyer before any
questioning takes place.
   Some police officials told the panel that the demands of the
exclusionary rule had promoted professionalism in the nation's
police departments.
   While the Miranda decision ``has sparked heated controversy on a
political level, the restrictions it imposes on custodial
interrogation of suspects are not considered troublesome by either
police or prosecutors,'' the panel said.

   Gay-rights proponents are promising a showdown
with the District of Columbia Council over its pgressionally ordered legislation
that would allow insurance
companies to test ilan to pass
connsurance applicants for the AIDS virus.
   ``The council has set us up for discrimination,'' said one
activist, Gerald Green.
   The bill, given preliminary approval Tuesday, would repeal a 1986
ordinance that prohibits insurance companies from testing applicants
for the AIDS virus. The council had passed that measure out of
concern that homosexual applicants would be denied coverage, and it
voted to scrap the law only after ordered to do so by Congress.
   Congressemonstrate against the people who gave you this problem.''
   Male homosexuals have been the chief victims of AIDS _ acquired
immune deficiency syndrome. The contagious, fatal disease has
claimed the lives of some 44,000 Americans since 1981, according to
government records.

   Benazir Bhutto took the seat her
father once held as parliamentary leader Wednesday and awaited an
invitation from Pakistan's president to form a government.
   She and other legislators in Pakistan's national and provincial
assemblies, elected in the first free vote in more than a decade,
were sworn in Wednesday.
   Ms. Bhutto, mobbed by well-wishers as she arrived at the National
Assembly, told reporters: ``As leader of the largest party in
parliament, I'm looking to the president to call on our party to
form the government.''
   If President Ghulam Ishaq Khan selects her, Ms. Bhutto would be
the first woman to lead a Moslem nation. The president is to
designate a prime minister Thursday night.
   In the National Assembly, Ms. Bhutto sat in the house leader's
chair, a seat her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, occupied from 1973
until he was overthrown by Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq in a bloodless
1977 coup.
   Bhutto was executed in 1979 after he was convicted of conspiring
to kill a political rival.
   Next to Ms. Bhutto sat her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, who also won
her first seat in the legislature in the Nov. 16 National Assembly
polls.
   The Bhuttos' Pakistan's People's Party won 93 of 205 seats at
stake, compared to 55 taken by their conservative rivals. The
remainder went to independent candidates and minor parties.
   The national legislature drew nearer to its full count of 237
members Wednesday as the new lawmakers voted to fill 20 seats
reserved exclusively for women. By-elections for the other seats
will be held later although no date yet has been set.
   Ms. Bhutto said her party can command a majority but refused to
say who else has promised to support her.
   Justice S.A. Nusrat, chief election commissioner, led 194
national assembly members in the oath of office.
   Then Ms. Bhutto rose as the first to sign the parliamentary role
book as her party group stood and applauded.
   ``I realize how important the struggle has been but we have
finally reached Parliament,'' she told reporters. ``Although there
are many limitations we are still hopeful of bringing about change.''
   Under the constitution, the president must designate a prime
minister from among the National Assembly who is most likely to
survive a vote of confidence.
   Ms. Bhutto has pledged to help restore democracy after 11 years
of Zia's rule.

   Ms. Bhutto's has pledged to help restore democracy to Pakistan

28 others were killed in a Aug. 17 plane crash. An investigation
found sabotage as a probable cause for the crash, but no arrests
have been made and the probe is continuing.

   China's foreign minister travels to Moscow on
Thursday for the first Sino-Soviet foreign minister-level talks on
Russian soil in 31 years.
   Qian Qichen, and his Soviet counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze, are
to lay the groundwork for another landmark: a 1989 summit that will
bring a formal end to three decades of hostility and mistrust
between the world's two great socialist powers.
   Qian's two-day visit is to focus on the war in Cambodia, which
has been the main roadblock to an early summit between President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   China has demanded that the Kremlin use its influence to prompt
Soviet ally Vietnam to withdraw its troops from Cambodia, where they
have been fighting China-backed resistance forces for the past 10
years.
   Deng and Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang have said a summit
could take place in the first half of 1989, depending on the pace of
progress on Cambodia at the foreign ministers' talks.
   Shevardnadze is slated to visit Beijing, probably in January, for
what could be the final meeting before the summit date is set.
   The last Sino-Soviet summit was in 1959 when Nikita S.
Khrushchev, accompanied by Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, met with
Mao Tse-tung in Beijing on the occasion of Communist China's 10th
anniversary celebrations.
   No Chinese foreign minister has gone to the Soviet Union for
talks since Chou En-lai, then also prime minister, in 1957.
   China and the Soviet Union split in 1960 after Mao accused
Khrushchev of ``revisionism'' and compromising with the capitalist
West. The Soviet Union responded by withdrawing Soviet engineers and
technology from hundreds of joint projects, dealing a painful blow
to China's fragile industrial base.
   Relations reached a nadir in 1969 when the two sides battled
along their disputed border. Mao called on the nation to prepare for
all-out war and each side stationed at least 1 million troops along
the frontier.
   The two countries began political normalization talks in 1982,
opening the way for an easing of tensions and a gradual increase in
trade, scientific and cultural exchanges.
   Last year border talks were resumed after a nine-year suspension,
and the foreign ministers have met the last two years during the
United Nations General Assembly session.
   However, China continues to stress there are ``three obstacles''
to full political and party-to-party relations _ Cambodia, Moscow's
occupation of Afghanistan and Soviet troop strength on the Chinese
border.
   The Soviet Union's decision to leave Afghanistan and its
withdrawal last year of an army division from Mongolia have shifted
China's attention to the Cambodian question.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said last week, ``the
Soviet Union has indicated on many ocasions its willingness to work
for an early settlement to the Kampuchean (Cambodian) question.''
But she called on Moscow to make further ``practical efforts'' to
get Vietnam out of Cambodia.
   In a commentary on Qian's visit, the official Xinhua News Agency
said, ``the normalization of relations between Beijing and Moscow
conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries and
desires of the two peoples.''
   It said, ``both the Soviet Union and China are carrying out
across-the-board reforms to speed up the development of their
national economies, which require a peaceful external environment,
and good-neighborly relations in particular.''
   However, it stressed that normal relations do ``not mean a
comeback of alliance ties such as that in the 1950s'' when China was
heavily dependent on the Soviet Union for economic assistance and
followed the Moscow line on international issues.

<HEAD>Farm Prices Decline in November</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers got for raw products in November
declined slightly from a month earlier but remained nearly 8 percent
above their level of a year ago, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report that lower prices for hogs, corn, grapefruit and
soybeans were partly offset by higher prices for tomatoes, potatoes,
milk and sweet corn, resulting in an overall drop of nearly 1
percent for the month.
   In part driven by the summer's drought, prices received by
farmers had been rising throughout most of 1988 until September,
when the increase leveled off. November's decline was the first drop
in the price index since February.
   Despite the decline of the overall price index, some commodities
continued higher in November. Wheat, for example, rose an additional
6 cents per bushel to a U.S. farm price average of $3.90 per bushel,
the highest since it was $3.95 in May 1981.
   Prices of livestock and livestock products as a group were off
just less than 1 percent from October. Hog prices, at $36 per
hundredweight, were the lowest since June 1980, while beef cattle
prices were unchanged at $67.10. Dairy products and eggs were
higher, while broiler prices declined. Compared with November 1987,
the index was up 5.6 percent.
   The department's all-crops price index for November, although
unchanged from October, was up 11 percent from a year earlier.
Prices of feed grain and hay as a group declined 3.7 percent from
last month and averaged 49 percent above the year-earlier level.
   Prices of commercial vegetables were up 22 percent from October
but off 30 percent from November 1987. Tomatoes led the price
increases, while carrot prices decreased slightly.
   Although the projections are subject to change, USDA economists
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $55
billion to $60 billion this year, compared with the record level of
$57.1 billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts
and cash expenses during the calendar year.
   Preliminary figures show that food prices for 1988 will average a
4 percent increase, about the same as last year's increase. For
1989, department economists are projecting food cost hikes in the
same range, about 3 to 5 percent.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $67.10 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally,
the same as a month ago and up from $62 in November 1987. Those are
averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $36 per 100 pounds, compared with $38.70 in
October and $40.60 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.46 a bushel, was down from $2.58 in October and up
from the average of $1.61 per bushel a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.90 per bushel, compared with $3.84 in October and $2.69
a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $6.38 per 100 pounds, compared with $6.75 in
October and $7.08 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $7.27 per bushel, compared with $7.53 in October
and $5.36 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 54 cents per pound, the same as
October and down from 66 cents in November 1987.
   _Eggs were 59.4 cents per dozen, compared with 58.7 cents in
October and 53.6 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $13.20 per 100 pounds, compared with $13 in October and
$12.90 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 35 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
37.5 cents in October and 26.3 cents a year ago.

   A fund-raising calendar featuring 12 officers in
mildly racy poses and brandishing weapons is under attack from the
police chief for glorifying guns.
   The calendar, produced by the police union to raise funds for
charity, shows officers pointing guns directly at the photographer
in several shots, including the cover photo. In one picture, an
officer is holding a machine gun, while a different photo shows a
female officer in a police T-shirt and black fishnet stockings
holding a pump-action shotgun.
   ``In today's violent society, I don't think anyone should glorify
guns,'' said Police Chief Morris Redding, who initially approved the
fund-raising idea.
   ``After viewing the finished product, I was disappointed,''
Redding said Tuesday. ``I was hoping it would show the officers in a
more professional light.
   But Detective Ken Cullifer, treasurer of the International
Brotherhood of Police Officers Local 623, which produced the
calendar, said it was perfectly natural for the officers to be
pictured with guns.
   ``If you were a plumber, you'd be standing there with a
plunger,'' Cullifer said. ``Police carry guns, so we used guns as
props.''
   Despite Redding's statements, police spokesman Cal Jackson said
he knew of no plans by the department to block calendar sales.
   Union officials said the police chief's approval was not
necessary for officers to appear in the calendar.
   If the 5,000 calendars that were printed sell, the union plans to
publish a calendar yearly. Cullifer said the $7 calendars have been
selling well.
   A message from the police union on the calendar says it was
produced to raise funds and ``to show you, the public, a different
side of the police officers who serve you every day throughout the
year.''
   Profits will go to the Atlanta Disabled Officers Fund and one
other yet-to-be-named charity.
   ``I hope no one takes it too seriously,'' said Detective Lisa
Roey of the Sex Crimes Unit. ``We're just trying to show that police
are people too, and we do people things just like everyone else.''

   A fire at a plastics factory left 60
firefighters overcome by toxic fumes and prompted officials to
evacuate up to 800 people, authorities said.
   Twelve firefighters remained hospitalized Wednesday.
   ``The conditions were unusual,'' fire Capt. James Bielby said of
Tuesday night's fire. ``We had strong winds driving those chemicals
right at our guys. They went right to work and strapped their air
packs on, but you get a certain amount of that stuff just by being
around the fire. It only takes a few breaths.''
   Bielby said his department had lost track of records indicating
dangerous chemicals were stored at Divorce Plastics Inc. because it
had changed hands.
   ``It used to be a garage door manufacturer, but we weren't made
aware of it,'' he said. ``It's one of those cases where everything's
against you.
   As many as 800 residents were evacuated as 55-gallon drums
containing the chemical isocyanate exploded during the blaze, which
erupted about 8 p.m., officials said. They were allowed to return to
their homes about 3 a.m. Wednesday.
   Bruce Dorland of the Genesee County Coordination Center said
residents were evacuated as a precaution because isocyanate _ used
by the company to manufacture plastic automotive bumpers _ could be
harmful if swallowed or absorbed through the skin.
   The firefighters were listed in good condition.
   The fire caused about $3 million in damage and was under
investigation.

<HEAD>Dali Remains in Critical Condition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Surrealist painter Salvador Dali remained
in extremely critical condition Wednesday, but his secretary said he
asked to listen to Bach violin concertos when he woke up after a
quiet night.
   The 84-year-old artist is suffering from severe heart trouble
aggravated by blood clots in the lungs, according to doctors at the
Quiron Clinic.
   They limited the number of visits to the painter after too many
government officals called on him Tuesday.
   Maria Teresa Brugues, Dali's personal secretary, said Dali had a
``quiet night'' and asked to listen to classical music, particularly
the violin concertos of composer Johann Sebastian Bach.
   One of five doctors attending the painter said the fact there had
been no change in Dali's condition since Tuesday ``is a positive
sign, even if it does not clear away the uncertainty about his
future condition,'' according to the Spanish news agency EFE.
   However, his extremely critical condition should not be minimized
to create false expectations about a strong recovery, said the
doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Dali was taken to the hospital in his hometown of Figueras, about
60 miles north of Barcelona, on Sunday after he developed pneumonia
and heart trouble. On Monday night, he was rushed to the intensive
care unit of the Quiron Clinic.
   The flamboyant artist, one of the founders of the surrealist
movement, is the last member of a generation of Spanish painters
that included Pablo Picasso, who died in 1973, and Joan Miro, who
died a decade later.
   Dali has lived in seclusion and suffered from frequent bouts of
depression since the death in 1982 of his wife, Gala.
   In 1984, Dali was severely burned in a fire at his home in the
hamlet of La Pera, 40 miles south of Figueras, and was hospitalized
for three months. Since then, he has been bound to a wheelchair, fed
through a nasal tube and attended by nurses round the clock.
   After his 1984 hospitalization, Dali moved to a residence
attached to his Theater-Museum in Figueras. In 1986, doctors gave
him a pacemaker.

   The vice presidential mansion may need some
alterations before the Quayle family can move in, Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle said Wednesday, echoing a sentiment
expressed two days earlier by his wife Marilyn.
   But Quayle's staff was quick to say the family is not finding
fault with the Victorian residence on the grounds of the Naval
Observatory and is actually pleased at the prospect of living there.
   Quayle said the mansion is not configured for a family with three
children. It does have six bedrooms, but some of those serve as
offices and servants' quarters and some do not have closets.
   ``There's just not enough bedrooms there for the children, so we
probably won't be able to move in right away after the Bushes move
into the White House,'' Quayle said in an interview.
   Mrs. Quayle told Senate wives the same thing on Monday, but an
aide said she had not seen the house at the time. Since then, she
has toured the house with Mrs. Bush and is ``quite eager to move
in,'' said spokesman Jim Carroll.
   ``She thinks it is a beautiful place and acknowledges they have
to make some modifications to accommodate three young children, but
is quite pleased with the residence,'' he said.
   The Quayles will continue to live at their home in McLean, Va.,
until they can move into the official residence. Their three
children _ Tucker, 14, Benjamin, 12, and Corinne, 10 _ will continue
attending public schools in Virginia for the time being, Quayle said.
   In 1975, the federal government spent about $311,000 to convert
the mansion on Embassy Row into an official vice-presidential
residence. The vice presidents who have used the house did not have
school-age children at the time.
   Nelson Rockefeller refurbished the mansion but did not live
there. Walter Mondale did not redecorate the house.
   Friends of the Bushes raised more than $100,000 in 1981 to
redecorate the residence and refurbish public rooms used for
official entertaining.

   The head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
said Wednesday that U.S. nuclear power plants have grown safer and
more efficient over the last four years.
   The remarks by Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. came at ceremonies to
dedicate an 18-story headquarters building for the NRC in suburban
Rockville, Md.
   He noted that ``in 1984 NRC began trend analysis of the key
nuclear parameters used to monitor reactor operation safety. From
1984 until now, there has been a clear and definite improvement.''
   Zech said there had been reductions in unplanned automatic
shutdowns, other safety system alarms and exposure of workers to
radiation.
   ``Along with this improvement in critical safety performance
indicators, we have seen improvements in plant reliability and
availability,'' Zech said. ``Recent data shows an increase in the
average capacity factors for U.S. reactors from about 59 percent in
1986 to almost 67 percent in 1988.''
   The capacity factor represents the actual output of a plant
compared to what it would generate if it operated at full power all
the time.
   NRC spokesman John Kopeck later provided the following specific
figures for the performance indicators cited by Zech:
   _``Significant operating events,'' meaning major problems: 2.4
per operating reactor in 1985; 1.6 in 1986 and 0.8 in 1987.
   _Unplanned automatic shutdowns: 5.24 per reactor in 1984; 5.04 in
1985; 3.96 in 1986 and 3.24 in 1987.
   _Safety system actuations: 2.76 per reactor in 1984; 2.6 in 1985;
2.04 in 1986 and 1.68 in 1987.
   _Precursor events signaling the possibility of a major accident:
a nationwide total of 17 in 1984; 10 in 1985 and 6 in 1986.
   _Radiation exposure: 714 man-rem in 1984; 574 man-rem in 1985;
431 in 1986 and 425 in 1987.
   Man-rem is a measure of radiation exposure for large numbers of
people. For example, when 100 people receive an average exposure of
0.01 rem, that would result in a figure of 1 man-rem.
   Spokesmen for anti-nuclear groups questioned Zech's assessment.
   Kenneth Bossong of Public Citizen, a Washington-based public
interest group founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, said:
``It's a mixed bag. There are some positives and there are some
negatives. It's not fair or accurate for Zech to say everything is
looking better because it's not.''
   For example, Bossong said, ``on the radiation issue, what he said
is true as far as it went, but it's not complete. The average dose
per worker at nuclear power plants has decreased since 1984, but the
number of workers exposed, on the other hand, has increased.''
   He said the number of workers exposed has increased from 93,000
in 1985 to slightly more than 100,000 in 1986 and 104,000 workers in
1987.
   Michael Mariotte, director of the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service, another Washington-based public interest group,
said: ``There may be a slightly improving track record. However,
there's no reason to be smug about it. ... It seems like every time
they think something has been solved, they find a new problem.''
   The new 286,000-square-foot NRC headquarters building, purchased
by the government for $47.5 million, provides space for about 1,400
NRC employees. It marks an effort to consolidate operations of the
agency, which previously were dispersed among 10 separate buildings.
   A second structure is to be built at the same Rockville site by
1991 to accommodate the rest of the agency's Washington area
employees.

<HEAD>Bush Praises Jackson, Wins Plaudits From Environmentalists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush sat down Wednesday with Jesse
Jackson, the man who only a few months ago he dubbed a ``hustler
from Chicago,'' and said he will be looking to the Democrat for
suggestions during his presidency.
   While Bush made no policy commitments to Jackson or to a group of
environmentalists with whom he met earlier, it was a day of positive
reviews for the president-elect.
   Jackson said he was convinced Bush ``has an earnest desire to
send forth a moral tone'' in his presidency.
   And one of the environmental leaders, Jay Hair of the National
Wildlife Federation, said Bush's receptivity was a ``night and day''
difference from the Reagan White House years of ``ideological
shrillness, anti-environmental actions and lack of stewardship.''
   Bush and Jackson, after a meeting sought by the former Democratic
presidential candidate, played down their differences and their
harsh campaign criticism of one another, including allegations by
Jackson and others that part of Bush's presidential campaign incited
racist fears.
   ``The campaign is over. I have no arguments with the way Reverend
Jackson conducted himself toward me, and I hope it's the same with
him on a personal basis,'' Bush said.
   ``There will be times in my presidency when I will ask for his
suggestions. ... He has some very good ideas on a lot of subjects
that are of keen interest to our country.''
   During the presidential campaign, Republican Bush once called
Jackson a ``loose cannon,'' and on a campaign trip to Nebraska in
May vowed he would return to the state because ``I`m not going to be
out-hustled by the hustler from Chicago or that traditional liberal
Democrat from Massachussets,'' the latter a reference to Gov.
Michael Dukakis who defeated Jackson for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   Jackson joked Wednesday that he and Bush had talked about the
Republican ``moving begrudgingly but with a lot of excitement toward
liberalism.''
   He brought three of his children to the lunch meeting in Bush's
office, and they ate with Bush's oldest son, George.
   On another subject, Bush sidestepped reporters' questions on
stories of disagreement within his staff on the possible naming of
former Sen. John Tower of Texas as defense secretary.
   ``Stay tuned,'' Bush said, repeating his favorite refrain on
pending administration nominations. ``All is tranquil'' within his
staff, he laughed.
   Meanwhile, Samuel K. Skinner, chairman of the Regional
Transportation Authority in the Chicago area, emerged as Bush's
likely choice for transportation secretary. A government source,
commenting on condition he not be named, said Skinner talked to Bush
transition staffers in Washington on Tuesday and probably would meet
with Bush next week.
   As for the environment, representatives of a coalition of 30
environmental groups said they were impressed with the positive
reception from Bush and his aides when they presented him with a
700-proposal ``Blueprint for the Environment.''
   Hair said he had told the vice president, ``Mr. Bush, read my
lips: Protect the environment.'' He said Bush reacted positively to
the wordplay on his own no-taxes campaign phrase, replying, ``I
will, I will.''
   Jackson also invoked that famous Bush line when Bush laughingly
told him to be careful what he said to reporters because, ``I'm
listening carefully.''
   ``Watch my lips,'' Jackson said jovially.
   Among the issues Bush and Jackson said they discussed were drugs,
arms control, South Africa, allegations of racism against Bush's
Republican presidential campaign and foreclosure warnings sent by
the Reagan administration to thousands of family farmers.
   On the farm foreclosures, Jackson said Bush had promised to have
his staff meet with a group of farmers with whom Jackson has been
talking about the problem.
   The two men also talked about the decision by Secretary of State
George Shultz to deny U.S. entry to Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat to address the United Nations.
Bush reiterated that as vice president, he continues to support that
and other administration policies.
   Jackson said Bush ``has given himself room to take his own
position'' on the matter after becoming president.
   Jackson, who once said Bush was ``morally unfit'' to lead the
country, said he hoped Bush would keep his pledge to seek a ``kinder
and gentler nation.''
   He brushed aside a question about his campaign criticism of Bush.
And he dealt only briefly with his contention that Bush's emphasis
on the furlough of black convicted murderer Willie Horton during the
campaign incited racism.
   ``We put that in perspective. We didn't dwell on it. That as a
campaign strategy is behind us,'' said Jackson.
   Bush told Jackson it was not his intention to stir racial fears
by using the Horton furlough against Dukakis, whose state of
Massachusetts let Horton out.
   ``It is important that the president be sensitive to signals and
to messages sent,'' Jackson said. ``I'm convinced he has an earnest
desire to send forth a moral tone. I certainly hope he will follow
through on that commitment.''
   Bush praised Jackson's years of work in the war on drugs.
   Noting the two have met on occasion during Bush's vice
presidency, the president-elect said, ``We've had a relationship
that transcends politics and it addresses itself to national
issues.''

   Thieves broke into a church in Rome during the night
and stole 50 figures from a priceless 18th century Christmas crib,
police said Wednesday.
   The handcarved figures in wood, terracotta and porcelain that
were in the Saints Cosmas and Damian Church range in size from 14 to
20 inches.
   The thieves also removed two solid gold halos from a plate
depicting the Virgin Mary and Jesus.
   Police said the thieves entered the church, located near the
Colosseum, after unhinging a door at the back of the building.

   Marcus Aurelius is back in the saddle.
   The Roman emperor and his horse were reunited Tuesday after an
eight-year restoration of the gilded bronze equestrian statue.
   Restorers had detached the emperor from his steed after age and
traffic pollution took their toll on the 1,800-year-old work that
graced Rome's municipal square atop the Capitoline Hill.
   The statue will be on display at the San Michele Central
Restoration Institute for a month while city officials and experts
decide whether to return the work to the square and risk repeated
damage, or put it in a museum.

<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop presented his
office's highest award Wednesday to the surprised director of the
Smoking Policy Institute, a not-for-profit organization based in
Seattle.
   Robert A. Rosner said he was in Washington to consult with
officials of the Environmental Protection Agency and accepted Koop's
invitation to drop by for what he thought was a courtesy call.
   Instead, Koop had arranged for a television film crew to record
the presentation to Rosner of the Surgeon General's Medallion.
   Rosner said afterward that Koop had encouraged him to form the
institute after the two worked together on some anti-smoking video
tapes in 1985.
   During the presentation, Koop said Rosner had a special ability
to ``go into the workplace and get people to accept no-smoking rules
and, more importantly, to like it.''
   Rosner said his institute, which exists mostly on foundation
grants and contributions, has worked with about 400 private
companies to develop plans to eliminate smoking in the workplace.
   He said he attributes his success largely to having a ``great
deal of empathy and concern for the way smokers get treated in this
society.''
   ``There are two kinds of serious pollution in this country,''
said Rosner, who added that he has never been a smoker himself.
``One is air pollution from the ends of lit cigarettes and the other
is noise pollution from the mouths of non-smokers.''
   Rosner's emphathetic approach _ ``We don't present it in a
value-laden context'' _ is reflected in a booklet his institute has
just completed for Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which expects to
distribute 1 million copies.

   The Vatican plans to hold a major conference
on AIDS next year, a top church official said Wednesday.
   The conference will deal with scientific, social and ethical
aspects of AIDS, said Archbishop Fiorenzo Angelini, who is charge of
health issues for the Vatican.
   Scientists, health workers, political officials and theologians
are expected to attend the meeting, which will last about two weeks
in November 1989.
   In a major statement on AIDS, the Vatican said in March that what
the Roman Catholic church considers ethically aberrant behavior must
be avoided and that using condoms ignores the issue of sexual
permissiveness, which it called ``the true cause'' of the disease.
   The Vatican, which counsels Catholics to abstain from sexual
practices outside marriage, condemns the use of condoms under any
circumstance.

<TEXT>
   In the 30 years since fire at Our Lady of the
Angels School took the lives of 92 children and three teachers, the
neighborhood is changed, the school rebuilt. Stronger safety
measures are in effect at schools nationwide.
   But scars remain and sadness returns in the memories of those who
survived the elementary school disaster.
   ``I suppose it's a memory that will never go away,'' said Jean
Kobus, mother of two children who escaped the blaze.
   It was mid-afternoon on Dec. 1, 1958, when the fire broke out.
Authorities think it started in a pile of trash in a stairwell.
   Smoke and flames traveled quickly up the open stairwell,
spreading out on the top floor and trapping many of the school's
1,300 students and teachers in their rooms.
   ``The fire alarm went off ... and children were hanging out the
windows yelling `fire.' It was just mass pandemonium,'' recalled the
Rev. John Kobus, Mrs. Kobus' son, who was a 7-year-old second-grader
at the time.
   Efforts by firefighters, teachers and some neighbors couldn't
lessen the death toll that stands as the third worst in the city's
history.
   In the aftermath, sprinkler systems were installed in schools
with wood-based construction, Edward Prendergast, chief fire
prevention engineer with the Chicago Fire Department, said Wednesday.
   School systems nationwide also began requiring enclosed
stairwells, alarm systems, more fire-resistant material and more
fire drills.
   Kobus, now director of pastoral care at Chicago's St. Mary of
Nazareth Hospital, remembers escaping from his first-floor classroom
and being wet and cold outside.
   But his mother recalls the anxious moments of uncertainty as she
and her family searched for her children.
   ``We ... started running toward the school,'' she said in an
interview Wednesday from her suburban Glen Ellyn home. ``If we'd
meet anybody, we'd ask if they knew Milt (then a seventh-grader) or
John, and they'd say `no.'''
   Just outside the school, ``You could see the crowd was anxious
and frightened,'' she said.
   ``My father (finally) found John, who was kind of wandering
around,'' she said.
   Milton, now an executive with a technology school, had been
huddled with others in a second-floor classroom until a firefighter
knocked in the door, and made the children form a ``human chain'' to
walk to safety, Mrs. Kobus said.
   Milt's grandmother found him, his face black with soot, and took
him home.
   The effect on the Italian neighborhood was devastating. Mrs.
Kobus remembers visiting homes and talking to grieving mothers. She
estimates she went to at least 25 funerals.
   ``I felt guilty talking to them because I felt that my children
were safe, and I thank God for that, and they had to lose theirs,''
she said.
   ``All those closed coffins, pictures on the coffins. It was the
saddest thing in the world to see.''
   Sister Mary Fogarty was principal of then-nearby St. Mary's High
School, and was sent to the county morgue to identify the three
teachers killed. Children's bodies, and anxious relatives, also were
arriving, she said.
   She remembers a stunned silence among many family members she
consoled.
   ``They were so shocked and so crushed,'' she said. ``I don't
think they could work up hysteria.''
   ``We have never gotten over it,'' she said of herself and others
in the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary order of nuns,
which still runs the new Our Lady elementary school with 520
students.
   The Italian neighborhood has changed, and is now mostly black and
Hispanic, said the Rev. Michael Gabriel, pastor of the nearby Our
Lady of the Angels Church.
   He said a service to commemorate the victims will be in his
church Sunday.
   Despite the years that have gone by, he said, ``Our faith is the
only consolation in a tragedy like this.''

   Environmentalists gave George Bush a wish list
of more than 700 recommendations Wednesday, topped by a plea for
action on fighting global warming, and were cheered by his response.
   The difference between Wednesday's reception and the past eight
years of the Reagan administration was like ``night and day,'' said
Jay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation and one
of the six leaders of environmental groups who spent 45 minutes over
breakfast with the president-elect.
   ``I am an environmentalist,'' Bush proclaimed in the campaign.
Among specifics, Bush has endorsed the goal of no net loss of
wetlands, has urged new acid rain controls if the government's $5
billion, five-year ``clean coal'' demonstration programs prove
disappointing and has said he plans to sponsor an international
conference on global warming.
   The few environmental groups endorsing candidates backed Bush's
opponent, Michael Dukakis, and some that made no formal endorsement
still attacked Bush for his leadership of the regulatory reform task
force early in the Reagan administration.
   But all that seemed forgotten in the warm glow surrounding a
crowded post-breakfast news conference arranged by a coalition of 30
environmental groups organized under the name ``Blueprint for the
Environment.''
   Bush said ``we would be rather surprised and really pleased with
some appointments he planned to make in the near future,'' according
to Tina Hobson, executive director of Renew America, a group
concentrating on energy efficiency. Bush also said he would arrange
pre-confirmation meetings of his nominees with environmental leaders.
   Hair said he told the vice president, ``Mr. Bush, read my lips:
Protect the environment,'' and Bush reacted positively to the
wordplay on his own no-taxes campaign phrase, replying, ``I will, I
will.''
   ``We will be on his team,'' said John Adams of the Natural
Resources Defense Council.
   Hair said the early 1980s were a time of ``ideological
shrillness, anti-environmental actions and lack of stewardship'' in
the administration. Though Bush was the second-ranking member of
that administration, Hair said, ``I didn't sense any of that this
morning.''
   The ``greenhouse effect'' warms the Earth when gases, notably
carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, trap infra-red radiation
that normally would escape into space.
   Most scientists agree that the earth has warmed by almost one
degree Fahrenheit over the past century, and the warming will
accelerate to another three to eight degrees sometime in the next
century. The major remaining uncertainty is over timing, with some
estimates putting such a warming by 2030 and others in 2075 or later.
   When it came to the greenhouse effect, Bush ``knew what we were
talking about,'' said Adams, who called it ``the single most serious
problem facing the world,'' because of the massive shifts in crop
patterns, weather and seacoast changes that could follow.
   Though Bush gave no commitments on that or any issue, ``he was
concerned and he was prepared to take action,'' said Adams.
   The greenhouse effect is clearly the top priority of the group.
The first four of 61 recommendations singled out as important enough
for a separate listing all dealt with it in one way or another _
promotion of an international agreement, ending use of chemicals
that destroy the ozone layer, reforestation and aggressive energy
conservation programs.
   The environmentalists, who have spent a year drawing up
recommendations in 16 green books for distribution to affected
government departments and agencies, also called for tax and fee
increases and other tax law changes that would increase government
revenues by $17.1 billion, spending cuts totaling $2.2 billion and
spending increases aimed at benefiting the environment totaling $5.5
billion.
   The new taxes would include a 10-cent increase in the current
9.2-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax to raise $10 billion.
   The new spending would include $2 billion to improve mass transit
and $325 million or 20 percent more for the Environmental Protection
Agency, which the group said should be elevated to Cabinet status.
   The recommendations encompass just about every federal action
environmentalists have sought in recent years, reveal some
duplication and are bound to prove hard to carry out in some
instances.
   Some of the proposals, such as the elimination of irrigation
subsidies and money-losing timber sales, have been rejected by
Congress several times.
   New opposition came quickly on Wednesday, from the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, which said in a statement from Harvey Alter, manager of
resources policy, that the recommendations were ``incomplete,
alarmist, misleading and intellectually dishonest.''
   ``The blueprint should be rewritten around a broad environmental
consensus of goals, followed by an honest attempt to construct
strategies that will meet these goals in a timely and cost-effective
fashion,'' Alter said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston University's proposal to overhaul Chelsea's
impoverished public schools is close to a contract, but opponents
promise to fight private management of the tax-funded system.
   The unprecedented offer was made three years ago, when Chelsea
began looking for outside help. The 3,400-student district has the
highest dropout rate in the state and has not built a school since
1923.
   On Tuesday, Suffolk Superior Court Judge Walter Steele denied the
Massachusetts Federation of Teachers an injunction stalling the
contract with the university, although he noted there are questions
about its legality.
   Union lawyers said they would pursue their legal challenge,
maintaining that the contract would usurp local officials'
authority, particularly in the hiring and firing of teachers.
   The Chelsea School Committee nevertheless voted 5-2 Tuesday night
to tentatively accept the university's offer to run the district for
10 years. Officials said they expect to have a finished contract
within the next few weeks.
   John Zimini, president of the Chelsea Board of Aldermen, which
would have to approve the contract, defended the proposal Wednesday.
   ``We have to step out of the 19th century and get into the 20th
century,'' Zimini said.
   ``I think that it takes an awful lot of courage on the part of
the city to say, `Hey, look we've tried our best, the money's just
not there,''' he said. ``Unfortunately in our society any kind of
change is always a fear factor.''
   The working-class town on Boston Harbor, with its influx of
Hispanic and Southeast Asian immigrants, has been strained
financially by a 1980 state tax-limiting law.
   Zimini said he cannot predict how aldermen will vote, but
believes the contract will eventually be approved. It also requires
approval by the Legislature.
   ``It's not over yet,'' said Paul Devlin, president of the
Massachusetts Federation of Teachers. ``A decision as critical as
the constitutionality of privatizing a public school system should
be made by the higher courts.''
   University officials maintain they won't be taking the public
schools private, but will simply be managers who have to answer to
the School Committee.
   The university proposes to revamp the curricula, build new
schools, provide mothers and pregnant teen-agers counseling on
nutrition and child-rearing, tailor learning plans to individual
students and set up after-school programs.
   The state Board of Education has voted against the proposal in
its present form, saying it could not accept failure to require the
university to open its books. The board's approval is not needed,
but its recommendation could influence legislators.

   Leftist guerrillas Wednesday
attacked an army outpost with rifle and mortar fire, killing nine
soldiers and wounding several, the armed forces said.
   Two rebels died and about 15 were wounded in the two-hour
firefight, according to an army spokesman who requested anonymity.
   He said two air force jets and several helicopters armed with
rockets and machine guns helped repel the pre-dawn attack on El
Roblar, about 15 miles north of San Salvador near the Guazapa
volcano.
   In the eastern San Salvador suburb of Soyapango, guerrillas
burned a city bus and sprayed gunfire on a second Tuesday night, but
no one was injured, the spokesman said.
   Soyapango justice of the peace Isaac Fayes Gonzalez said four men
who had witnessed the attack were killed about a half hour after the
ambush, but he said he ``cannot affirm that the same ones who
attacked the buses also killed the four. That is conjecture.''
   In another incident Tuesday night, two guerrillas were killed in
a skirmish with troops outside the city of Jutiapa, about 20 miles
northeast of San Salvador, the army reported.
   Marxist guerrillas have waged a 9-year-old civil war against the
U.S.-backed government led by President Jose Napoleon Duarte. An
estimated 65,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed.

   Legal experts have accused police of breaking the
law by seizing mail during a crackdown on contraband, an official
newspaper said Wednesday.
   Chinese lawyers and legal experts attending a seminar in the
northeastern city of Shenyang said police had violated citizens'
freedom of communication when they took 1,509 mail bags off a train
in September, the China Daily reported.
   The police action produced 27,387 cartons of cigarettes,
pornographic videos and other black market items on their way to
Shenyang.
   The bags were held for a month before being returned _ minus the
contraband _ to the post office for delivery, the newspaper said.
   A newsletter of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, quoted
by the China Daily, said police failed to go through legal channels
and should undergo judicial review.
   ``The mail is protected by the law and you cannot act regardless
of the law ... even if your intentions are worthy,'' the newsletter
was quoted as saying.

   Sinhalese militants, critical of the president for his peace
overtures to Tamil rebels fighting for a homeland in the northeast,
claim the government is incapable of conducting a fair election.
They are demanding the Sinhalese president resign.
   Opposition politicians and the Buddhist clergy also have demanded

   Taiwan's chief government spokesman has canceled a
speech next week in Tokyo after journalists from China protested his
planned appearance.
   Shaw Yu-ming was to address the Foreign Correspondents' Club of
Japan ``on the unprecedented political and economic thaw with
(Beijing),'' the press club said.
   Yang Guoguang of the China News Service and Zeng Hu of the Xinhua
News Agency, both state-run news organizations, protested Shaw's
scheduled appearance as a representative of Taiwan.
   The island nation is governed by the Nationalists, who fled China
after losing to the communists in 1949 and claim they are the
rightful leaders of their former homeland.
   ``The People's Republic of China is the sole legal government
which represents China,'' the two journalists said in a letter to
the press club, adding that they demand the lunch be canceled.
   Japan has no diplomatic ties with Taiwan.

   Jesus Hernandez clutched the papers he hoped
would give him permanent residency status in the United States and
said Wednesday he believed the government is ``trying to help us.''
   The 25-year-old from Jacisco, Mexico, and his 20-year-old
brother, Jose, were among the illegal alien agricultural workers who
lined up in Oklahoma City to beat a midnight deadline for seeking
immigration amnesty.
   ``I have been here for four years, and I like it,'' Hernandez
said. ``Oklahoma is a real nice state.''
   Although he said he now works ``drawing designs'' for a monument
company in Enid, Hernandez said he and his brother harvested crops
before that. They will have to prove that to the satisfaction of
Immigration and Naturalization Service investigators to be eligible
for U.S. residency.
   A special provision of the 1986 amnesty law set a midnight
deadline for illegal alien agricultural workers to prove they
harvested perishable crops in the United States for at least 90 days
in the one-year period that ended May 1, 1986. If they do so, they
will receive temporary residency; later, they may apply for
permanent residency.
   Hernandez said he did not have too much trouble making it to
Oklahoma in 1984.
   ``I took a bus to the (Rio Grande) river and then walked,''
Hernandez said. ``I walked for two days and two nights until some
friends came for me in a car. They brought me to Oklahoma, and here
I am.''
   Hernandez' brother stayed in the background among the 50 or more
applicants waiting in the INS office as Hernandez spoke. The brother
shook his head no when asked if he would like to add anything.
   Some illegal aliens have expressed concern about the amnesty
program, fearing it was just a ruse to get them to come out of
hiding so they can be deported.
   ``I don't think so,'' Hernandez said when asked whether he
thought the government was fooling the aliens. ``I think they are
trying to help us. I think they want to help us.''

   Riot police fired tear gas to stop
hundreds of chanting workers and students from marching to the
presidential palace Wednesday to demand former president Chun
Doo-hwan be tried for corruption.
   Thousands of police with shields blocked the protesters when they
tried to march out of a city center subway station and move toward
the Blue House presidential palace to denounce Chun and President
Roh Tae-woo.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan! Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' protesters yelled.
   Some protesters lashed out with clubs and poles at riot police
blocking the way with shields as the two sides pushed and shoved
each other. But protesters were unable to break through.
   About 1,500 protesters then marched through the main shopping
district, yelling slogans and hurling leaflets into crowds of
onlookers on the sidewalks. A group of students hurled firebombs at
a government office but did not cause any damage.
   Riot police attacked the march from the rear, hurling tear gas
grenades into the column of protesters. Dozens of students fought
back with firebombs and rocks during a brief clash, but most
protesters ran for cover.
   Police had no word on arrests or injuries.
   The protest was smaller than major protests Nov. 19 and 26 when
thousands of people demanding Chun's arrest clashed with police in
Seoul. Thousands of people watched the protest Wednesday, but very
few gave any sign of sympathy or support.
   Some 200 students demanding the former president's arrest battled
riot police with firebombs in a separate protest Wednesday in
Songnam on Seoul's southern outskirts.
   Dissident groups are demanding Chun be arrested and tried for
human rights abuses and corruption under his authoritarian rule.
   Chun went into rural exile last week after apologizing to the
nation for abuses under his rule and saying he would turn over
millions of dollars in personal assets to the government. He has
denied any personal wrongdoing.
   The Australian Embassy in Seoul said Wednesday its government was
checking to determine if any of Chun's relatives or associates had
diverted official funds to Australia. The embassy said the checks
were being made at the request of the South Korean government.
   Roh, trying to defuse the furor over Chun, was studying plans
Wednesday for a major government shake-up to remove vestiges of the
old government. News reports Wednesday said a new cabinet was
expected to be announced by early next week.
   Political leaders also studied plans for reform of South Korea's
powerful national and military intelligence agencies to end their
domestic spying and surveillance functions.
   Government officials had no immediate response to a call Tuesday
by the Public Administration Reform Commission for drastic curbs on
the Agency for National Security Planning to end its use in domestic
politics.
   The agency, formerly known as the Korean Central Intelligence
Agency, and the military intelligence have traditionally play major
roles in domestic politics. Both agencies have operated against
anti-government groups of all kinds.
   A former army chief of staff, Chung Sung-hwa, said Wednesday
during National Assembly hearings that Chun and other top military
officers seized power after staging ``a mutiny'' in December 1979.
   Chung accused the former president of acting out of greed for
power and said the incident almost sparked a major confrontation
within the military.
   Chun and Roh were among a group of generals who took power
following the October 1979 assassination of President Park Chung-hee
by his intelligence chief in a dispute over handling protests.
   Chun and Roh have said they acted to save the nation from chaos
and had no thoughts of taking power. Chun was a close protege of
president Park.
   Chung, who was army chief, was arrested by Chun's military
intelligence command for possible complicity in Park's death. He was
later dismissed from the army in disgrace after being demoted to the
lowest rank of private.
   Chung first made his accusation against Chun and Roh during
presidential elections in December last year. Roh won the election.

Unions</HEAD>

   Thousands of leftist workers and
youths cheered Wednesday as protesters burned an American flag and
shouted slogans seeking the ouster of U.S. bases and against an
alleged crackdown on militant labor unions.
   Elsewhere, the military reported eight people, six of them women,
were killed in three separate shootings on southern Mindanao island.
   Wednesday's rallies were led by the militant labor confederation
May First Movement to mark the 125th birthday of Andres Bonifacio, a
19th Century leader who led the fight against Spanish colonialists.
   Smaller rallies were also held outside the U.S.-run Clark Air
Base and in the central city Cebu, about 350 miles southeast of
Manila.
   Police said about 1,000 people turned out for the rally at Clark,
about 50 miles north of Manila. The U.S. military's Far East Network
television station said the main gate to the base was closed and
urged American servicemen to avoid the rally.
   In Manila, police estimated that some 12,000 protesters attended
the rally, most of them carrying red streamers with anti-U.S.
slogans. The protesters shouted slogans and waved banners calling
for the dismantling of six U.S. installations in the country.
   The demonstrators burned a U.S. flag at a downtown square in
front of the central post office and later marched to Mendiola
Bridge, the main gateway to President Corazon Aquino's office.
   About 500 police were deployed at the bridge, where the marchers
held a brief rally.
   Leto Villar, vice chairman of the May First Movement, told the
crowd the government was mounting an anti-communist propaganda
campaign but ``we know that communism is not the cause of poverty.''
   Leftists have accused the police and military of cracking down on
legal left-wing organizations. Two leaders of a Movement-affiliated
transport workers union were arrested last week and charged with
inciting to sedition after leading a strike of passenger jeep
operators.
   Dozens of activists and leftist union organizers have disappeared
in recent weeks. Their families believe they were either kidnapped
or murdered by police or soldiers.
   The military claims the Movement is a communist front, but union
officials deny the charge.

<HEAD>Syrian Soldiers Raid Homes To Search For Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian troops raided suspected weapons
depots in Moslem neighborhoods Wednesday after six days of violence
between rival militias killed 40 people and wounded 87.
   The Syrian command said the searches by 200 helmeted Syrian
troops in trucks and an armored personnel carrier were aimed at
making west Beirut a demilitarized city.
   The cleanup operation was launched Monday after almost a week of
clashes between members of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God, and the pro-Syrian Amal, Arabic for hope, in south and west
Beirut.
   The battles between the militias may be endangering the lives of
14 Western hostages, including nine Americans, believed held by
Hezbollah in the slums of Beirut.
   In the past two days, Syrian troops detained 350 suspected
militia gunmen in house raids, said a police spokesman, who demanded
anonymity. He said most of them have been released after being
interrogated, but about a dozen remain in custody.
   ``The Syrian command should disarm both Amal and Hezbollah to
prevent further clashes,'' said Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin,
Lebanon's senior Shiite cleric, in a broadcast on the Moslem Voice
of Nation radio.
   On Wednesday, Syrian troops confiscated two rifles buried in an
empty lot in the Mossaitbeh district, witnesses said.
   The Syrians entered two buildings occupied by Shiite squatters in
the old Jewish quarter of Wadi Abu Jamil and a deserted Shiite
mosque in the Rawsheh neighborhood, but they found no weapons, said
one witness, who refused to be identified.
   ``A Syrian officer asked several residents in Wadi Abu Jamil
whether they had weapons. All of them said they didn't have weapons
and the officer seemed to believe them because he did not order the
troops to search their apartments,'' the witness said.
   The two militias are vying for dominance of Lebanon's 1 million
Shiites, the nation's largest religious sect.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troops
in the eastern and northern provinces and in Beirut.
   The Syrians entered the city on Feb. 22, 1987, to end three years
of battles between militias that has resulted in killings,
kidnappings and robberies.

<HEAD>U.S. Personal Income Makes Largest Gain in 12 Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American personal income posted its largest
gain in a year in October, the government said Wednesday in a report
cited as more evidence of economic strength and inflationary
pressure.
   However, a separate report to the Federal Reserve Board found
evidence of ``an apparently slower pace'' of growth. Financial
markets rallied, interpreting it as a signal that Fed members are
less worried about inflation than previously thought.
   The Commerce Department said personal income rose 1.8 percent,
the biggest rise since October 1987, to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $4.18 trillion last month. The gain followed modest
increases of 0.5 percent in September and 0.4 percent in August.
   The department attributed about half of last month's increase to
farm subsidy payments and bonuses to auto workers. However,
excluding those factors, income still would have risen a hefty 0.9
percent.
   ``This throws cold water on the view the economy slowed down
much,'' said John Hagens, an economist with The Wefa Group, a Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm. ``It may have taken a bit of a pause
in August and September, but it came roaring back in October.''
   The concern in financial markets has been that growth is too
strong. High levels of employment will lead to higher wages, and
strong consumer demand will lead to higher prices, they fear.
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with The Futures Group, a Washington
consulting firm, said retailers likely will be pleased with the
income gains.
   ``There are more people working and people are earning more
money,'' she said. ``Retailers will be at least reasonably satisfied
with the Christmas season.''
   However, in a review of the economy based on assessments from the
12 regional Federal Reserve banks, the Fed reported ``an apparently
slower pace'' of growth, moderate wage increases and slightly eased
price pressures in several manufacturing industries.
   ``It doesn't sound like the same economy we're looking at,''
Hagens said.
   Personal consumption spending, which includes everything except
interest payments on debt, was up a robust 0.8 percent to an annual
rate of $3.30 trillion following a weak 0.1 percent rise in
September.
   The biggest spending increase last month was for services, up 1.4
percent, followed by a 0.6 percent increase for non-durable goods.
Spending on durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three or more years, fell 0.6 percent.
   With income rising faster than spending, Americans saved more
than in any month since October 1987. The personal savings rate _
savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ was 5.2 percent, up
from 4.2 percent in September.
   Disposable, or after-tax income, was up 1.9 percent last month,
also the largest increase in a year, after rising 0.6 percent a
month earlier.
   Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, were up a
strong 1.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $2.51
trillion, bolstered by a 2.1 percent increase in manufacturing
salaries. The auto bonuses accounted for about 60 percent of the
manufacturing increase.
   Farm income rose a huge 76.2 percent to an annual rate of $46.7
billion, largely because of government payments for corn harvested
in 1987.

<HEAD>First Low-Alcohol Pub Closes, But Others Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regulars sipped their last fruit juice Wednesday at
the Milestone pub, but fans of the pioneering bar for non-drinkers
said its example lives on.
   The Milestone opened at Exeter in the southwestern England in
1985 as Britain's first low-alcohol bar, serving soft drinks and the
occasional low-alcohol beer. Since then, 31 similar bars and clubs
have sprung up around the country, most of them for, mostly for
teen-agers.
   Operators of the Milestone blamed its closure on lack of public
funds, on which it was run almost exclusively for the first 2{
years. Officials said it had made a path others are following.
   ``I don't think (the closing) is a bad sign,'' said Juliet
Gosling, spokeswoman for the government's alcohol-education body,
Alcohol Concern.
   ``I think it's very sad, but new clubs and bars are opening every
week. There's unprecedented interest in setting up this sort of
venture,'' she said in a telephone interview, adding that other such
bars ``have learned from the Milestone.''
   ``We expressly set out not to make (the Milestone) a club for
ex-drinkers,'' said Mike Tristram, director of the Exeter and
District Council on Alcohol, the charity that ran the Milestone.
   He said only one-third of the pub's customers were people with
drinking problems, and two-thirds were ``the general public who
prefer a non-alcoholic environment.''
   Low-alcohol beer carries an alcohol content of 0.9 percent,
whereas alcohol in regular beer can range up to 10 percent. A
British bitter, drawn from the tap, typically contains just under 4
percent alcohol.
   Low alcohol isn't the only attraction of the new pubs, however.
Assistant Manager Graham Hampson said ``a lot of women come in
because they fear being molested in other places.''
   The Milestone, which cost more than $28,000 annually to operate,
was heavily supported at its beginning by an annual $22,000 grant
from the national Mental Health Foundation.
   But when the foundation grant ran out this year, the pub could
not break even. Ms. Gosling said its location, in the basement in a
community services building away from the city center, also made
profits elusive.
   The pub will now be made into a club for physically and mentally
handicapped people.
   ``Some nights the place has been packed, and we've only taken 20
pounds'' or $40,'' said Manager Norrie McKechnie, a 41-year-old
reformed alcoholic. ``People don't come in and drink five pints of
orange juice.''
   Tristram said, ``it's very unfortunate that an initiative like
this wouldn't attract more public support for funding.''
   But he and McKechnie agreed that the Milestone had achieved some
of its objectives.
   ``Our closure will make everyone think alcohol-free pubs don't
work, but the failure is only in commercial terms. It's helped so
many people,'' McKechnie said.
   Ms. Gosling attributed the popularity of such bars to growing
concern about alcohol-related problems like drunken driving,
underage drinking and work accidents.
   Many of the bars were opened with teen-agers or families in mind,
she said.
   A spokesman for the Brewers Society, which represents most of the
country's 117 brewers, said sales of low-alcohol products have
doubled every year since 1985. The society recently launched a
campaign to get drivers to drink low-alcohol products in regular
pubs.
   Of the Milestone, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity:
``I can't quite see the point of it. I'm surprised it lasted that
long. If you want to go to a place without alcohol, go to a cafe.''

   An aerial photograph of the B-2 stealth bomber,
taken from directly overhead, was published in the Nov. 28 edition
of Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine.
   The official view of the plane was head-on, from a reviewing
stand.
   William G. Hartenstein took the picture from a private airplane
on Nov. 22, the day the plane was put on display for the first time,
David Quast, assistant managing editor of the magazine, said
Wednesday.
   ``We had a private airplane flown by one of our writers, who is
also a pilot,'' said Quast. ``It was not restricted airspace. There
was no restriction and no rule broken. There was a possibility
President Reagan was going to be there. Had he been, it would have
been restricted.''
   The stealth bomber was put on display Nov. 11 after more than 10
years of secrecy-shrouded development.
   The bomber is a subsonic, all-altitude flying wing formed from
non-metallic composite materials that are intended to let it absorb
radar transmissions rather than reflect them. Its shape and lack of
sharp angles also help make it nearly invisible to radar.
   Air Force officials say it makes the same impression on a radar
screen as a bird.

<TEXT>
   The chancellor of the main campus of
Louisiana State University has resigned amid a furor over his
decision to readmit a graduate student who cheated and is related to
a powerful legislator.
   LSU System President Allen Copping announced James Wharton's
resignation at a news conference Wednesday. Wharton was not present
and did not come out of his office to talk to reporters.
   ``I'm very sorry about this, but he feels that because certain
things have happened that certain faculty members have lost
confidence in him,'' said Copping, who stressed he did not encourage
the chancellor to resign.
   Wharton served seven years ago as chief executive of the
27,000-student campus here. He has tenure and will return to
teaching chemistry, Copping said.
   The announcement came shortly before the faculty senate was to
release a critical report on Wharton's decision to readmit the
student.
   Copping acknowledged that the student, whose name has not been
released by the university, is related to Sammy Nunez, president pro
tem of the Louisiana Senate. Pressed by reporters, Copping said
Wharton told him that Nunez had inquired about the student's status
and had talked with the chancellor.
   The incident came to light in October when members of the faculty
questioned Wharton about the incident. The senate said it appeared
Wharton acted on matters the faculty should control _ academics and
admissions.
   At the time, Wharton said he felt the only issue was what rules
apply in punishing a student. The graduate school catalog calls for
a two-year suspension for academic misconduct while the Code of
Student Conduct calls for a one-semester suspension.
   Wharton said in October he felt the code should apply because the
two-year rule was enacted after the student entered LSU.
   ``Chancellor Wharton and I have talked about this at length and
he said he felt he followed the proper procedures,'' Copping said.
``I may or may not have done the same thing.''
   Copping said Wharton told him of the decision to resign on
Tuesday night and the LSU Board was informed Wednesday. Copping said
he has not decided on an interim chancellor.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve's district banks in
November reported ``apparently slower'' growth, moderate wage
increases and slightly eased price pressures in several
manufacturing industries, according to a report released Wednesday.
   The new report, based on surveys conducted by the 12 Fed district
banks, stirred a rally in financial markets Wednesday as investors
interpreted the findings as a signal that the Fed might be williing
to loosen its credit policy because of signs of a slowing economy
and easing inflationary pressures.
   However, some private economists said they believed the Fed
district banks were overstating the economic slowdown and the
central bank will still be forced to tighten credit conditions in
coming months.
   ``We think there will be more consumer price inflation,'' said
John Hagens, chief economist for the WEFA Group, an economic
consulting firm. ``We think it is almost inevitable that the Fed
will continue to tighten.''
   The Fed survey was prepared for the Dec. 13-14 meeting of the
Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee, the panel which sets
monetary policy for the central bank.
   ``Most districts report continued economic growth, but at an
apparently slower pace than in previous months,'' the Fed survey
said. ``Only Dallas, St. Louis, and Kansas City report generally
sluggish business conditions and cite persistent weakness in many
sectors.''
   The survey of economic conditions, known as the Tan Book, said
that wage increases continued to be moderate even though labor
markets around many part of the country are tight.
   ``Capacity pressures, and consequently price pressures, have
reportedly eased slightly in several industries, including paper,
chemical, steel and textiles,'' the survey found.
   The survey said that while retail sales have been slow there was
optimism in many cities for a pickup in sales during the holiday
shopping season.

<TEXT>
   The key witness in a 1977 murder trial whose
outcome was questioned in the film ``The Thin Blue Line'' recanted
Wednesday and testified that Randall Dale Adams is innocent in the
killing of a police officer.
   Death row inmate David Ray Harris, called as a witness in Adams'
hearing to ask for a new trial, said he was alone in a car stopped
by Officer Robert Wood, who was killed in the incident Nov. 28,
1976. Harris acknowledged his finger was on the trigger when Wood
was shot, but stopped short of saying he killed the officer.
   Based on Harris' testimony, State District Judge Larry Baraka
said he would determine that Harris had admitted to the killing.
   ``As far as the court is concerned, he is telling me that he
did,'' Baraka said. But the judge did not decide immediately on
Adams' request.
   Adams was convicted of killing Wood and sentenced to death, but
the sentence later was commuted to life in prison. He has maintained
his innocence, and his conviction was questioned in the Errol Morris
movie ``The Thin Blue Line.''
   Harris testified he was biased in favor of the prosecution when
he first implicated Adams. Harris said prosecutor Doug Mulder had
promised ``to take care of'' other criminal charges pending against
him in return for his testimony.
   ``Did Randall Adams kill Robert Wood?'' attorney Randy Schaffer
asked Harris, who was wearing an orange jail uniform, handcuffs and
shackles.
   ``No, he did not,'' Harris replied. ``Randall Adams knew nothing
about this offense and was not in the car at the time.'' Harris had
initially said he and Adams were both in the car when it was stopped
by Wood.
   Harris said that after he testified at the 1977 trial that he
crouched in the car as Adams shot Wood, he was not prosecuted in his
other pending cases and did not have to continue reporting to his
probation officer.
   A recommendation by Baraka for a new trial would go to the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals, which may act on it. The hearing is
expected to take several days.
   Harris is on death row for a 1986 conviction for murdering a
Beaumont man whose home he broke into in 1985.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Prince Was Investigated for Cocaine Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A German prince who killed himself
after his wife died of a drug overdose was investigated for a
cocaine deal also involving deceased film director Rainer Werner
Fassbinder, a newspaper said Wednesday.
   Bild, a mass-circulation Hamburg paper, also said officials in
Hanover called off another drug-related investigation of 33-year-old
Prince Ludwig Rudolf of Hanover last week for lack of evidence.
   Ludwig, great-grandson of Germany's last emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm
II, was found dead Sunday in Austria with his hunting rifle at his
side.
   Austrian police said he killed himself after finding his wife,
Princess Isabelle, 26, dead of a cocaine overdose earlier in the day
in their bedroom at the luxurious Koenigin-Villa at Gmunden, 90
miles northeast of Salzburg.
   Bild said the couple ``appear to have had a long drug career
behind them.''
   The daily said Hanover officials last week called off for lack of
evidence an investigation that the jet-set prince had purchased
drugs.
   It said Munich officials also investigated the prince in 1981 for
a cocaine deal said to have involved Fassbinder, the West German
movie director who died in Munich in 1982 of a cocaine and sleeping
pill overdose at age of 36.
   ``He (Prince Ludwig) was suspected of buying 33 grams (slightly
more than one ounce) of `coke' for 6,725 marks (just under
$3,900),'' said the newspaper.
   It said authorities suspected Fassbinder of buying cocaine in the
same deal, but the investigation was dropped because of insufficient
evidence.
   Heinz Stocker, head of the Munich prosecutor's office, and
officials at the Hanover prosecutor's office could not be reached
for comment on the Bild report. A woman at Stocker's office, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was not in town.
   Bild quoted Johann Haberl, the Austrian doctor who performed
autopsies on the prince and princess, as saying: ``There were about
a dozen puncture marks in the princess' arm and they had not healed.
Some of them are probably no more than a week old.''
   Prosecutors in Austria said investigators found punctures on the
arms of the prince as well.
   Austrian police say the case is under court investigation, but
refused to give details.
   Bild said Ludwig and some musician friends tried to revive his
wife for about an hour through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and
heart massage, to no avail. Ludwig then went to a wooded area and
shot himself, it reported.
   Ludwig and his wife moved in the world of rock music and fashion
and both lived for years in England.
   The prince was a distant relative of Queen Elizabeth II of
Britain and Bild said Elizabeth plans to send a representative to
the couple's funeral on Friday near Gmunden.

   The Kremlin has shut down thousands of
broadcast jamming devices, allowing Radio Liberty and Radio Free
Europe to be heard ``loud and clear'' across the Soviet Union and
most of Eastern Europe for the first time in 38 years, government
officials said Wednesday.
   The Soviet action came so quickly that radio engineers were only
becoming aware of it as Secretary of State George Shultz said in a
broadcast to Europe Wednesday morning that radio jamming was one
area where progress was still needed with the Soviets.
   Soviet jamming of Germany's Deutsche Wella and KOL Israel also
stopped Tuesday, officials said.
   ``It's another marker in the Soviet march toward trying to be an
acceptable citizen of the world community as against the pariah that
they have been,'' said Charles Z. Wick, U.S. Information Agency
director.
   Wick said he and other U.S. officials have raised the issue of
jamming, which is illegal under international agreements, several
times with the Soviets _ most recently in a September visit by U.S.
broadcasting officials to Moscow.
   He said the move was likely was timed to coincide with the
meeting of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev with President Reagan and
President-elect George Bush next week in New York.
   The jamming shutoff means that millions of Eastern European and
Soviet citizens will hear American and other Western news and
analysis in their own languages of events in the Soviet bloc. Voice
of America, which has not been jammed anywhere except in Afghanistan
since May 1987, focuses more broadly on U.S. and world affairs. VOA
operates independently of Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe.
   ``The cessation of jamming represents a significant step on the
part of the Soviet government toward the free flow of information,''
said Gene Pell, president of Radio Liberty, which is a
congressionally funded operation based in Munich, West Germany. Pell
said that it was a strong signal in support of Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or openness.
   Pell said, however, jamming was still continuing against Radio
Free Europe broadcasts to Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. VOA
broadcasts in the Dari and Pashto languages into Afghanistan also
were still jammed, but the broadcasts of Radio Afghanistan,
affiliated with Radio Free Europe, into the war-torn country were
clear, he said.
   Some officials suggested the limited jamming might be the result
of a mix-up between the Soviets and allies who operate separate
jamming gear.
   ``Reports from the Soviet Union and the Baltic republics confirm
that Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe broadcasts are being heard
loud and clear,'' said Pell.
   He cautioned, however, that there was no indication whether the
lifting was a permanent decision or whether it will be expanded to
include ``an absolute and irrevocable end to all jamming.''
   Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., chairman of the Board for International
Broadcasting, which oversees the radio operations, said the Soviets
had been giving signals that the jamming might be stopped but the
action Tuesday came as a surprise.
   Forbes said the action could bring significant savings to the
Soviets, who officials estimate have been spending up to $1.25
billion a year on jamming.
   Forbes said any savings for the $200 million U.S. broadcasting
operations would probably be erased by the need for increased
programming to replace broadcasts that will no longer have to be
repeated several times to get through the jamming.
   The Soviets have jammed VOA broadcasts off and on through the
years prior to 1987, but government engineers say jamming efforts
against Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe have been constant since
they were set up at the start of the 1950s. Radio Liberty broadcasts
by shortwave into the Soviet Union and Radio Free Europe into other
Soviet Bloc countries, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Romania, and Bulgaria in their own languages.
   Beth Knisley, VOA spokeswoman, said one Radio Liberty listener
who talked to a VOA researcher said Tuesday he had picked up a
broadcast for the first time since the 1950s. She said she did not
know where the listener lived.
   Stanley Leinwoll, engineering director for Radio Liberty in New
York City, said the service has managed to overcome much of the
jamming by using higher frequencies and high-powered antennas and
other equipment.
   ``We have voluminous evidence that we've been heard, but the fact
is our effectiveness because of the jamming has been way down,''
Leinwoll said in a telephone interview.
   ``You can't not be excited about something like this,'' said
Leinwoll.
   Between 2,000 and 2,500 jamming devices are scattered across the
vast Soviet Union, with many more in Eastern Europe, Leinwoll said.
For them all to be turned off at once could not be an accident or
technical problem, he said.
   Leinwoll called the shutdown ``a momentous event,'' but cautioned
that ``They never do dismantle their devices. I certainly wouldn't
take any precipitous actions in terms of taking our anti-jamming
transmitters off the air.''

   The president of Estonia, the republic whose
declaration of sovereignty was quashed, told the Soviet parliament
Wednesday no political system suits all parts of this vast nation,
``so we have developed our own.''
   Arnold Ruutel also complained about the official media, which
criticized Estonia's actions without publishing details about them.
``We deplore the lack of objective information in the mass media,
which can only make the situation more tense,'' he declared.
   After two days of debate, a new experience for its members, the
Supreme Soviet sent a plan for restructuring the government back to
the Kremlin leadership for decisions on dozens of suggested
amendments.
   Until recently, the national legislature merely approved actions
already taken by the leadership, without debate or dissent. This
time the Supreme Soviet heard 37 of its members criticize and
propose changes in the plan submitted by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
president and Communist Party chief.
   On Wednesday, the 1,500-member chamber asked the Presidium and
two committees to decide which suggestions to include in a final
version to be submitted for a vote Thursday. The Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet is the nation's highest executive body and Gorbachev
is its chairman.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the two parliamentary
committees met Wednesday night, but it did not report details.
   in Wednesday's debate, deputies said the reform plan raises trhe
possibility that a representative could be elected to more than one
seat in the new national Congress.
   Gorbachev says his comprehensive reform of the political and
electoral system, which includes more than 100 pieces of
legislation, will help make the Soviet Union a society ruled by law
rather than central dictation.
   Estonia came under repeated attack by delegates for the
declaration by its legislature two weeks ago that the tiny Baltic
republic is ``sovereign'' in all but defense and foreign affairs and
has the right to veto Soviet laws.
   The Presidium responded by nullifying the declaration last
Saturday.
   Deputies leaned forward in their seats when Ruutel took the
podium Wednesday, but he neither apologized nor fought back. He did
not mention that several Esetonian leaders have indicated they would
ignore the Presidium order.
   He said his republic prefers its own political structure to one
devised in Moscow, and told the delegates: ``It is impossible to
find an optimum (system) for all regions of the country, so we have
developed our own.''
   A deputy identified only as Popinikov from the city of Vladimir
complained later in the day Ruutel ``did not even give us his
assessment of the Presidium action.'' He described Estonia's actions
as ``anti-social'' and said they ``undermine the unity and
principles of our multinational state.''
   Ruutel said he appreciated some of the 88 changes in the reform
plan announced Tuesday after five weeks of discussion, and expressed
gratitude for plans to ``widen and defend the sovereign rights of
republics'' in the next stage. He also indicated, however, that
Estonia still is not satisfied.
   Estonia would prefer to retain its current legislature rather
than exchanging it for a contemplated Congress of People's Deputies,
Ruutel said. The new national Congress, and similar bodies in each
of the 15 republics, would in turn elect smaller and more active
Supreme Soviets.
   The new legislative framework is a central element of Gorbachev's
package, but the deputies found fault with two elements of it _
indirect election of the Supreme Soviets and the proposal that
one-third of the Congress members be choosen by social and political
organizations such as the Communist Prty and trade unions.
   Critics said voters should elect their Supreme Soviet directly.
They said the second provision creates the possibilities of the same
person voting for both a deputy to be elected on a geographical
basis and one from his party or union organization, and of a person
holding more than one seat in the Congress.
   Ruutel said ``We should also allow each republic to decide how to
elect its deputies,'' but did not suggest the congress be eliminated
on the national level.

<HEAD>Senators Urge Bush To Block Social Security Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-five senators on Wednesday urged George
Bush to stop the Social Security Administration from restricting the
rights of the elderly and disabled to appeal decisions denying them
benefits.
   In a letter to the president-elect, 34 Democrats and Republican
Dave Durenberger of Minnesota urged Bush to make it clear that
``such a policy will have no place in your administration.'' The
letter was initiated by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio.
   Last year the agency received 5.5 million claims for Social
Security, Medicare and welfare benefits, and more than 300,000
appeals from its no-benefit rulings. The government lost more than
half of the cases that were appealed, according to a draft of the
proposal to change the rules on appeals hearings.
   Agency spokesman Philip Gambino has described the proposal as an
attempt to improve efficiency.
   But the senators' letter said the ``astonishingly high'' number
of cases won by people who were denied benefits ``suggests to us
that the Social Security Administration consistently makes
system-wide errors in determining eligibility.''
   ``But instead of correcting its mistakes the Social Security
Administration is trying to make it harder for claimants to appeal
those mistakes,'' said the letter.

<TEXT>
   A state representative and former head of
the Kentucky Democratic Party was indicted Wednesday along with his
brother on charges they misused more than $150,000 in state funds.
   State Rep. Jerry Lundergan and his brother, Tom Lundergan, were
charged with unlawful use of influence by a legislator and two
counts of theft. His brother, who is not a legislator, was charged
under the same crime as a conspirator.
   Jerry Lundergan resigned in August as state Democratic Party
chairman during investigations into his catering company.
   Most of the Franklin County grand jury indictment centers on a
state contract payment of more than $153,000 to a competing catering
company. The check allegedly was deposited in the bank account of
the Lundergan family's company, Lundy's Catering.
   The Lundergans are accused of using the name of a different
company _ Perfection Catering _ to hide the involvement of Lundy's
Catering in the no-bid contract.
   ``All I can tell you is, that my wife and I feel like human
footballs, and we're a strong family and we'll see this thing out to
the end,'' Jerry Lundergan said. ``I just hope this doesn't happen
to anybody else who has ever served in the General Assembly because
it's a frightening experience.''
   If convicted, Jerry Lundergan faces forfeiture of office on the
unlawful influence charge. Each of the theft counts carries maximum
penalties of five years in prison and a fine of $10,000.
   No court dates were set.

<HEAD>Tapes Show Warnings About Possible Explosives In Fatal Construction
Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The six firefighters who died in three
blasts that rocked a highway construction site had been warned there
could be explosives at the scene, transcripts of conversations with
dispatchers show.
   But fire officials said there were no signs at the site
indicating that the ammonium nitrate explosives were contained in
the construction trailers that blew up Tuesday.
   Two pumper crews were sent to the site in south Kansas City after
dispatchers were told that a pickup truck was on fire, and that
explosives might also be burning.
   The call came at 3:40 a.m. from someone who said the truck was
burning. Harold Knabe, the Kansas City Fire Department spokesman,
said Wednesday that officials do not know who made that call but
that they assume it came from two security guards at the site.
   The guards told investigators they had seen prowlers in the area
before finding the pickup burning. Police homicide and arson
detectives are investigating.
   As the dispatcher asked questions about the location of the fire,
another voice is heard in the background on the tape provided by the
fire department, saying, ``Oh, the explosives are on fire.''
   When the dispatcher asked what was burning, the first voice said,
``There's some explosives up on a hill that I also see now is
burning.''
   The dispatcher sent a pumper from Fire Station 41 to the scene,
with a word of warning of explosives.
   Capt. James Kilventon Jr., 54, headed the three-man crew that
reached the scene at 3:47 a.m. and immediately asked for another
pumper and then for police because of suspected arson.
   Ten minutes later, his pumper told the dispatcher to alert the
pumper crew from Fire Station 30 ``that there's the trailer on fire
up there, stay away from it.'' The crew also asked for a battalion
chief, and said, ``there's supposed to be explosives involved in
that.''
   At 4:08 a.m., Battalion Chief Marion Germann told the dispatcher,
``Explosion just as we pulled up in here. Get us a ... all kinds of
ambulances in here, get us ambulances ... and uh, at least a couple,
three more companies.''
   Just before the blast, Germann said he noticed what he described
as a glow coming from the trailer and decided to pull the crews
back. He was reaching for his radio to give the order when the
explosion hit, forcing his car back about 50 feet and breaking the
windshield.
   Officials said the first explosion was in a construction trailer
containing 30,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate, used most commonly as
a fertilizer but also used in blasting after being mixed with fuel
oil. A second trailer containing about 15,000 pounds of the chemical
exploded about half an hour later, and fire officials said there was
also another much smaller explosion.
   The blasts left two craters 30 to 40 feet wide and 6 to 7 feet
deep, along with a smaller one, and broke windows in scores of homes
and businesses.
   Fire officials reviewing the response of the two crews found no
immediate reason to question it.
   ``Everybody is kind of Monday morning quarterbacking,'' said
Knabe. ``But the officer in charge has to evaluate and size up the
situation. Whatever they were doing, apparently there was nothing
there to indicate to him there was any type of danger.''
   Knabe noted that Kilventon and Gerald C. Halloran, 59, the other
captain who died, had more than 60 years of experience between them.
   ``They are not going to direct their men into a place they know
is going to blow up,'' he said.
   The six firefighter deaths were a record for Kansas City.
Nationally, the most firefighters killed in one blaze was the 13 who
died in 1946 in a theater fire in Brockton, Mass., said David
McCormack, assistant to the president of the International
Association of Fire Fighters in Washington, D.C.

<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court on Wednesday
ordered the 122-year-old state penitentiary in northern West Viginia
closed in less than four years, and warned it may order the release
of all prisoners there if the state does not comply.
   Calling conditions at the West Virginia Penitentiary deplorable,
the court said releasing the prisoners ``may be the only remaining
alternative'' if a new prison is not built by July 1992.
   In a unanimous opinion written by Justice William Brotherton, the
court did not order construction of a new maximum-security prison
but recommended that the state Building Commission refrain from
buying or leasing any new buildings so the state can afford to
construct a replacement by the July 1, 1992, shutdown date.
   Gov.-elect Gaston Caperton, who enters office Jan. 16, declined
comment.
   William Whyte, executive assistant to state Corrections
Commissioner A.V. Dodrill, said the decision ``puts state government
on notice. ... They've given us sufficient time to get started on a
replacement.''
   Prisoners at the penitentiary in Moundsville just south of
Wheeling have complained of raw sewage, rats and unbearable heat and
cold in their cells. On New Year's Day 1986, prisoners rioted and
took 16 prison employees hostage, killing three fellow inmates
before releasing the hostages two days later.
   Then-Circuit Judge Arthur Recht ruled in 1981 that conditions at
the aging prison in Moundsville just south of Wheeling were
unconstitutional, and the state has done little to improve the
prison despite repeated court orders, the high court said Wednesday.
   ``If possible, the conditions have deteriorated even more,''
Wednesday's court order said.
   The court scheduled a hearing May 2 for state officials to give
their reasons why the justices should not place the prison in
receivership, give the receiver power to build a new prison, and
order the state Building Commission to finance the project.

   The United States would welcome ``forthcoming
statements'' from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on such issues
as troop imbalances in Europe and the Berlin Wall at next week's
superpower meeting, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Wednesday.
   While Gorbachev will hold only one session with President Reagan
and President-elect George Bush and is visiting the city primarily
to address the United Nations, ``there will be a lot of substantive
discussion,'' Shultz said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, meanwhile, Reagan
would raise arms control, human rights and the situation in
Afghanistan during the luncheon meeting on Governors Island in New
York Harbor.
   But, Fitzwater said, ``we're not going there with proposals,
we're not going there to solve specific problems. There will be
general discussion, there will be a very limited time frame.''
   He said ``the entire process will probably take two, three hours
_ no longer than that.''
   With Reagan due to leave office in six weeks, ``he's not going to
have promises to make,'' Fitzwater said. Bush, not yet in office, is
unlikely to have ``commitments to make,'' he said.
   At the same time, Fitzwater said, Gorbachev ``wants to assure
continuity and progress in dealing with this government and this
administration and certainly that objective will be fulfilled, at
least from our objective.''
   The U.S. and Soviet first ladies will have lunch at a separate
gathering, he said.
   Meantime, a spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange, said
Gorbachev is welcome to visit that citadel of capitalism if the
communist leader's schedule permits. Richard Torrenzano said Soviet
officials have discussed the possibility of a visit with exchange
officials.
   In a government-sponsored telecast to Western Europe, Shultz
stressed the preparations were not as thorough as those that
preceded Reagan's four other meetings with Gorbachev. ``Mr.
Gorbachev is basically not visiting the United States as much as the
United Nations,'' he said.
   However, Shultz said he hoped Gorbachev ``makes a lot of
forthcoming statements'' in the meeting. As examples, he said the
Soviet president could propose reducing the numerical edge Warsaw
Pact troops have over North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in
Europe or make ``a gesture such as saying he would tear down the
Berlin Wall.''
   ``Anything like that would be very welcome,'' Shultz said.
   Immediately after the meeting, Shultz will fly to Brussels to
brief the NATO foreign ministers, while Reagan will return to
Washington and make a speech that evening to the American Enterprise
Institute, a conservative-oriented think tank.
   The meeting will be held after Gorbachev addresses the U.N.
General Assembly. It is the only superpower session planned during
the Soviet leader's visit and is expected to range over several
subjects, including the suspended Soviet troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan. The U.S. side is seeking reassurances the Soviets will
complete the pullout by Feb. 15, as they have promised.
   Fitzwater described the agenda as ``very flexible.''
   He said Marcella Perez de Cuellar, wife of United Nations General
Secretary Javier Perez de Cuellar, would hold a luncheon in New York
on Wednesday for first lady Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev, wife
of the Soviet leader, in connection with the meeting of their
husbands.
   Bush's wife Barbara and Helena Shultz, wife of the secretary of
state, will attend as well.
   Perez de Cuellar is expected to hold a reception or dinner for
Gorbachev Wednesday evening at the United Nations. About 400 guests
from the international diplomatic community would attend.
   The next morning, Gorbachev will attend opening ceremonies for a
Soviet trade show at a New York convention center and tour the
exhibition. He is to fly to Cuba after the New York stay.

   NASA's tools and equipment may be the
most sophisticated money can buy, but some of the problems on
Atlantis were strictly mundane _ a leaky tire and broken bolts.
   One of the shuttle's $2,794 landing gear tires started leaking
while on the launch pad, and on Wednesday technicans found two
broken bolts on a critical panel cover.
   Officials decided they could ignore the tire problem, but decided
to fix the faulty bolts with every craftsman's best friend _ epoxy
glue.
   Launch pad technicians found the broken bolts when they attempted
to replace a cover protecting an access panel on the nose of
Atlantis. The access panel contains the connections used to fill
fuel tanks in the shuttle's forward steering rockets.
   The panel cover fits on ten bolts that are anchored in the hull
of the spacecraft. Nuts are then tighted on the bolts to hold the
cover tightly in place.
   But when the technicians attempted to install two of the nuts,
they found that the bolts were loose and the nuts would not tighten.
   The experts immediately reached for the glue, said Dave
Winterhalter, a NASA engineer.
   An attempt to glue the faulty bolts in place failed, but the
technicans hoped a generous application of epoxy bonding on the
cover itself would hold it in place. If the glue did not work,
engineers said it might force the space agency to delay the launch
by one or two days while new bolts were installed.
   Henry Pohl, a NASA engineering official, said it was no surprise
that there was a leak in one of the six tires used in the shuttle
landing system.
   ``All tires leak,'' said Pohl. ``It just that this one leaks more
than the others in the past.''
   The tire, on the right main landing gear, was losing pressure at
the rate of 1.7 pounds per square inch daily. It normally holds 330
pounds of pressure, but can be used if the pressure drops to as low
as 275 pounds, he said.
   If Atlantis is launched within two weeks, said Pohl, the leaky
tire would not create a problem.
   Should the leak continue for longer, NASA's equivalent of a trip
to the corner service station could cost millions of dollars in lost
time and effort.
   Pohl said that to repressurize the shuttle tire, technicians
would have to remove Atlantis from the launch pad and then unload
its solid rockets and external fuel tank, a project that could take
weeks.
   A set of tires on the shuttle costs $16,764 and are ``the best
that the tire industry can build,'' said Pohl. But the tires take
such a beating when the shuttle lands from orbit that they are used
only once.

<HEAD>Hijacker Says Diver Was Killed Because Raid On Plane Was Feared</HEAD>

   Confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed
Ali Hamadi said Wednesday that his accomplice shot and killed a U.S.
Navy diver aboard the plane because he was afraid the jetliner was
going to be attacked.
   Hamadi was commenting on testimony by co-pilot Philip G. Maresca,
who earlier told the court Hamadi came into the cockpit carrying a
gun seconds after 23-year-old sailor Robert Stethem was killed.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is being tried on murder and
air piracy charges in the June 1985 hijacking during which 39
Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   He has admitted taking part in the hijacking but denied killing
Stethem.
   The defendant disputed most of Maresca's testimony and again
blamed his accomplice, Hassan Ezzeddine, for killing Stethem.
Ezzeddine is a fugitive.
   Hamadi said armed men surrounded the plane in Beirut. He said
Ezzeddine fired two warning shots from the cockpit window as they
tried to approach.
   He said Ezzeddine earlier had told the tower he wanted to speak
to a certain person and became ``very agitated'' when that
individual did not show up.
   ``He came back and took Stethem. I spoke with him about it, but
he was determined that one of the military people had to be shot. He
was afraid of an attack on the plane,'' Hamadi said.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger asked who was it that Ezzeddine
wanted to speak to and Hamadi replied: ``He was the one responsible
for the hijacking and he was from Amal (the Shiites' main military
arm in Lebanon).''
   The judge asked if he was willing to identify the person and
Hamadi replied: ``No, not at this moment.''
   Hamadi denied going into the cockpit after Stethem was shot.
   Maresca told the court, ``I stand by my testimony.''
   The judge then adjourned the trial until Monday.
   Maresca testified regarding the circumstances of Stethem's
shooting:
   ``I was able to peek out of the corner of my eye and I thought I
was able to determine that a passenger ... was being dragged to the
front of the plane.
   ``Then I heard a gunshot. ... About 10 to 15 seconds later,
Hamadi came into the cockpit with a gun in his hand.
   ``Then Uli Derickson (the flight purser) came in very distressed
and said one of the passengers had been killed.''
   He fought back tears as he described the scene.
   The diver's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem, listened
quietly during the testimony. They have attended the trial regularly
since it began on July 5.
   Maresca, 46, said he did not see the shooting because Hamadi
ordered the crew ``to look forward and not behind and not to pay
attention to any noise.''
   The co-pilot said the hijackers beat the crew every time they
tried to establish radio contact with other aircraft or with
airports.
   Maresca said he felt from Hamedi's actions that Hamadi was the
leader of the two hijackers.
   ``He was more volatile, very excitable. The other hijacker tried
to restrain Hamadi when he was extremely abusive. Hamadi had the gun
most of the time and he made most of the demands on us,'' Maresca
said.
   The judge granted a defense motion for a psychiatric examination.
The defense says Hamadi was mentally disturbed at the time of the
hijacking.
   Hamadi was arrested Jan. 13, 1987 at Frankfurt airport after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

   The Drug Enforcement Administration said
Wednesday it plans no change in procedures under which it sometimes
arranges for local police officers to claim public credit for busts
of drug shipments that are brought into the United States by DEA
undercover operatives.
   The practice has raised objections from some news media
executives who say it is misleading for state and local police to
generate news stories on seizures of imported drugs that already are
under DEA control.
   The controversy stems from an article Sunday in the Houston
Chronicle, which said the DEA had arranged drug seizures to generate
false news reports that undercover agents could use in deceiving
druglords.
   It is reasonable for state and local police involved in such
cases to turn aside inquiries from the news media about the precise
details of how the busts came about, said William Alden, chief of
congressional and public affairs for the DEA.
   Alden said details come out in subsequent court proceedings, and
that the news media and the public are not misled.
   ``What we've done we feel comfortable with,'' said Alden.
   The DEA defended its actions in a meeting Wednesday with
Associate Attorney General Francis Keating, who then issued a
statement supportive of the DEA.
   ``I have been assured that it is not the policy of DEA to lie or
mislead the media, nor is it DEA policy to misrepresent information
to the media or the public in any fashion,'' said Keating. ``I am
satisfied that this is a wise policy which continues to be carefully
followed.''
   When DEA undercover operatives are acting as middlemen for South
American traffickers, the DEA on occasion arranges for local law
enforcement authorities to seize incoming drug shipments in an
attempt to protect the operatives from disclosure, agency sources
acknowledged, speaking on condition of anonymity. The practice is
designed to keep the drugs from reaching local dealers while
allowing the DEA to continue criminal investigations targeting
top-level drug figures, they said.

<HEAD>New EPA Rules Require Permits for Industrial, City Storm Sewers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency on
Wednesday unveiled draft regulations aimed at bringing storm-water
runoff under control, something that will require thousands of
industrial plants and scores of cities to apply for permits to
operate storm sewer systems.
   The regulations will not apply to the combined sanitary-storm
sewers commonly found in older Eastern cities, nor to plants whose
storm sewers discharge into a municipally owned system.
   The draft would exempt systems run by counties or other
non-municipal bodies. The exemption was called illegal by the
Natural Resources Defense Council.
   Stormwater runoff can be a major source of stream pollution in
urban areas, picking up oil from service station pavements, dirt
from construction sites, pesticides and fertilizers from lawns and
gardens, contamination leaking out of landfills and other forms of
pollution. Twenty-one states have reported construction site runoff
as a major source of pollution.
   EPA's draft regulations, ordered by 1987 legislation and
published for 90 days of public comment, require the nation's 170
cities of more than 100,000 people to get permits for their storm
sewer outflows. Officials said they did not know how many might not
qualify because the storm and sanitary sewers are combined.
   In addition, some 25,000 industrial facilities might have to
apply for permits, said James Elder, director of EPA's Office of
Water Enforcement and Permits. He said 75,000 to 100,000 probably
are connected to municipal systems, and these, though not needing
permits, will be required to inform the municipalities how they are
handling storm runoff.
   Cities below 100,000 population will not be brought under
regulation until after 1992, Elder said. Cities larger than 250,000
will have two years after publication of final regulations to
complete their permit applications; cities between 100,000 and
250,000 will have until February 1992.
   Final regulations might not be published until next February,
which would be a year after the congressional deadline, Elder said.
   Smaller cities, as in suburbs, with storm sewer systems that
connect with those of larger cities may be required to get permits
at the discretion of the regional EPA director or state authorities
in the 38 states with authority to run their own water pollution
control programs.
   The agency intends to avoid numerical concentration standards,
relying on requirements for good management of runoff.
Municipalities are being asked to almost write their own permits in
their applications, Elder said.
   The agency will require discovery and elimination of ``illicit
connections'' where sanitary sewers have been connected to storm
sewers.
   Plants required to get permits are those with not necessarily a
complete storm sewer system, but just ``any point source used for
collecting and conveying'' runoff.
   The agency will encourage general permits for construction
companies that would not be tied to specific sites, and will try to
grant group permits to plants that can show they are similar, he
said.
   The agency asked for specific comment on its plans to ignore
county-run systems for the moment, an exemption that Bruce Bowen, an
aide to EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas, said was made ``in the
interests of administrative feasibility. We want to make sure we
don't bite off more than we can chew.''
   Bob Adler, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council,
said 410 counties were large enough to be covered by the rule, and
their inclusion would mean storm sewers serving 66 percent of the
population would be covered instead of just 25 percent.
   Adler said the omission of counties was ``deliberately flouting
Congress' instructions,'' and the omission of specific control or
treatment requirements meant ``an institutionalization of the
fox-in-the-henhouse approach to pollution control.''
   But he said the plan was ``not all bad,'' and applauded EPA's
emphasis on the elimination of illicit connections.

<TEXT>
   A financial officer for political
extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. testified Wednesday he wrote
LaRouche in 1984 that he suspected that former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger was responsible for some of the movement's money
problems.
   Richard Welsh told LaRouche's conspiracy trial that he suspected
Kissinger's involvement after obtaining a copy of a letter Kissinger
wrote to the FBI soliciting advice about his own security from the
LaRouche organization.
   LaRouche and six co-defendants contend that government harassment
impeded their fund-raising capabilities and is at the root of a
failure to pay back the bulk of more than $30 million in loans to
LaRouche organizations.
   LaRouche and the six associates are charged with conspiring to
defraud those who lent the movement money by devising a scheme to
avoid repayment.
   The Kissinger letter to the FBI was obtained by the LaRouche
movement under the Freedom of Information Act, and admitted into
evidence at the U.S. District Court trial. Dated Aug. 19, 1982, and
addressed to former FBI Director William Webster, Kissinger wrote:
   ``I appreciated your letter forwarding the flier which has been
circulated by Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.
   ``Because these people have been getting increasingly obnoxious,
I have taken the liberty of asking my lawyer, Bill Rogers, to get in
touch with you to ask your advice, especially with respect to
security.''
   Welsh testified that he sent a memo to LaRouche in October, 1984,
in the midst of LaRouche's second of three presidential campaigns.
   ``You stated in the memo that Kissinger was behind the actions?''
to hurt the LaRouche organization financially, asked Assistant U.S.
Attorney Kent Robinson.
   ``It was the primary but not the only suggestion I made,'' Welsh
testified.
   Welsh, however, did not specify how he thought that Kissinger,
long a target of verbal assaults by LaRouche, could have created
financial problems for the movement by privately expressing concern
for his security.
   Welsh also testified that a tax lawyer advised him and other
LaRouche staffers to file federal tax returns even though it was not
clear that the law required LaRouche to do so.
   Welsh said he met with the tax lawyer to see whether LaRouche was
obligated to file returns even if he had no income and all his
expenses were paid for by organizations that were part of his
political movement.
   Welsh told the jury he was told that the assistance to LaRouche
should be treated as ``ordinary business expenses'' by the companies
and not as LaRouche's personal income.
   LaRouche alone is charged in the case with conspiring to defraud
the Internal Revenue Service by not declaring the personal and
household expenses he received as income and by not filing federal
income tax returns since 1979.
   Welsh said the tax lawyer ``recommended that a tax return be
filed, not because it was required'' but because LaRouche was ``a
controversial public figure.''
   In an effort to convince the jury that money spent for LaRouche's
security was actually used for his personal expenses, the
prosecution called to the stand Kathy Magraw, a LaRouche financial
staffer who testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution.
   She acknowledged under prosecution questioning that the security
account paid for a $7,000 piano, cufflinks for LaRouche, shoes for
his wife, Helga, clothing, luggage, a $10 haircut for LaRouche and
reimbursement for a purchase of wine.
   Ms. Magraw said the account also paid expenses for guests who
stayed at LaRouche's Leesburg, Va., estate.
   Seeking to rebut the argument that the money was used improperly,
LaRouche attorney William Moffitt attempted to question Ms. Magraw
about security expenses for two Latin American members of LaRouche's
organization whose lives had been threatened by drug dealers.
   However, U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. refused to allow
the defense to delve into the Latin American figures' backgrounds,
thus scuttling efforts to show there were legitimate expenses in the
security account that were not for LaRouche's personal benefit.
   LaRouche was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud,
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the IRS.
The mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters of
credit sent through the mails by the LaRouche organization.
Conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 years
in prison and fines of $3.25 million for LaRouche.
   The six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mail
fraud and conspiracy charges, which cover the years 1983 to 1987.
   In the tax conspiracy count, the federal grand jury charged that
LaRouche failed to declare as income the personal and household
services provided by his organizations.
   On trial with LaRouche are his chief fund-raiser, William Wertz;
his legal adviser, Edward Spannaus; and four fund-raisers: Michael
Billington, Dennis small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.

   Former President
Salvador Jorge Blanco returned home Wednesday to fight his
conviction on charges of political corruption and was taken to jail
immediately.
   Jorge Blanco arrived with several lawyers who traveled with him
from Atlanta, Ga., where he had undergone treatment for a heart
condition since May 1987.
   Soldiers and special security forces surrounded the international
airport of this Caribbean capital, keeping journalists away from the
former president.
   Jorge Blanco, 60, was tried in absentia and found guilty Sunday
of taking part in a scheme to sell overpriced equipment to the army
and police.
   Two businessmen, Leonel Almonte and Juan Thomas Pena Valentin,
were convicted of selling $35 million worth of equipment during
Jorge Blanco's four-year term, which ended in 1986.
   Jorge Blanco was taken in a helicopter to a the Preventive
Prison, a jail in Santo Domingo's La Fe district for people
appealing convictions. As a cell, Jorge Blanco was given a
comfortable room reserved for the prison warden.
   His lawyers presented a letter signed by Jorge Blanco asking the
judge who ruled against him to begin appeal proceedings as soon as
possible.
   Judge Juan Maria Severino ruled that Jorge Blanco ordered
military chiefs to buy 75 percent of the food, uniforms and vehicles
for police and armed forces from companies owned by Almonte and Pena
Valentin.
   Severino sentenced Jorge Blanco and the two businesssmen to 20
years in prison each and levied fines totaling $17.3 million.
   On Tuesday, Jorge Blanco blamed the verdict on President Juaquin
Balaguer, his political foe.
   ``I want to defend my honor,'' he said. ``My honor is above my
liberty. I never, ever used my influence as president to buy or to
order any purchase fr anyone.''
   Jorge Blanco campaigned for president as a moderate reformer. His
term was marked by bloody riots in April 1984, after his government
raised food prices dramatically as part of an austerity program.

<HEAD>Critics Attack Bill to Reform British Secrecy Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government presented a bill Wednesday to ease
Britain's secrecy laws, but critics from the opposition, media, and
activist groups said it would leave the nation still the most
secretive of Western democracies.
   The bill, if made law, would decriminalize minor leaks and make
some prosecutions more difficult.
   Critics have said a major flaw in the bill is that it does not
allow officials who leak information about questionable government
conduct, commonly known as whistle-blowers, to argue as a defense
that they acted in the public interest or that the information has
already been published elsewhere.
   The bill also provides no automatic right of access to official
information. Mrs. Thatcher has ruled out a Freedom of Information
Act like that of the United States.
   ``To claim this as a major advance toward ending secrecy in
government is nonsense,'' Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign
for Freedom of Information, said in an interview.
   ``Britain will remain extremely secretive and much worse off than
the major English-speaking countries with which we compare
ourselves: the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.''
   The opposition Labor Party maintained Wednesday that the proposed
measure will give the Conservative government of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher increased powers ``to withhold and conceal
information it might find politically embarrassing.''
   The bill, based on much-criticized proposals published last June,
confines secrecy mainly to defense, security and foreign affairs.
   In a change from the June proposals, only leaking or publishing
information about bugging, telephone tapping, and mail interception
by the secret security services would be an automatic offense. In
cases of other unauthorized disclosures by journalists or civil
servants, prosecutors would have to prove these harmed the national
interest.
   But a lifetime gag remains on members of the MI5
counterintelligence agency and MI6 intelligence agency and their
unauthorized memoirs.
   In the most notable recent case, the government lost a three-year
battle this year to ban publication of ``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs
of ex-MI5 agent Peter Wright, who lives in Australia.
   The bill, likely to become law by next summer, will amend a
section of the Official Secrets Act making it a criminal offense to
reveal any official information, however trivial, without
authorization.
   The act, passed hastily in 1911 during a German spy scare, has
bolstered Britain's reputation for secrecy, particularly since Mrs.
Thatcher won power in 1979.
   ``The bill is a notable essay in openness,'' Secretary Douglas
Hurd said in a statement as the measure was proposed Wednesday in
the House of Commons. ``We want to narrow drastically the scope of
official information covered by the law.''
   The draft measure stipulates penalties of up to two years in jail
for people convicted of unauthorized disclosures.
   However, the National Council of Civil Liberties said the lack of
a defense arguing that information was released in the public
interest means journalists could be jailed for ``disclosing
information in order to expose fraud, negligence or unlawful
activities.''
   In 1985, a jury acquitted civil servant Clive Ponting on grounds
that his exposure of a government cover-up surrounding the sinking
of an Argentine cruiser in the 1982 Falkland Islands war was in the
public interest. Critics say Ponting would likely be convicted under
the new bill.
   Michael Corner, spokesman for the Guild of British Newspaper
Editors, said the bill was seriously flawed ``as far as freeing
information is concerned and as far as the press is concerned in
carrying out its proper function.''

   A man who sued the heavy-metal rock group Judas
Priest, contending its music drove him to a 1985 suicide attempt,
has died after lapsing into an unexplained coma.
   ``The Judas Priest lawsuit is going forward. We are not daunted
one bit. As a matter of fact, it's more important than ever,''
attorney Timothy Post said Wednesday.
   James Vance, 23, was pronounced dead at 10:48 p.m. Tuesday at
Washoe Medical Center, where he had been in a coma since
Thanksgiving Day, said spokesman David Stipech.
   Vance had been on a life support system since he lapsed into a
coma. He was disconnected from the respirator after he was declared
brain dead.
   Vance and his parents sued Judas Priest and CBS Records, alleging
that subliminal messages in the British group's music caused Vance
and Raymond Belknap, 19, to make a suicide pact after listening to
the ``Stained Class'' album for six hours while smoking marijuana
and drinking beer.
   The two took a shotgun to a church playground in nearby Sparks
two days before Christmas 1985 and shot themselves in the head.
Belknap died instantly and Vance was disfigured after shooting away
part of his face.
   The lawsuit, which was filed by both families, is pending in
Washoe District Court.
   Judge Jerry Whitehead has ordered CBS to produce the 24-track
master tape of the ``Stained Class'' album, but so far the
defendants have found the master for every track but a song called
``Better By You _ Better Than Me.''
   Prosecution attorneys contend that song contains the hidden
message, ``Do it. Do it,'' and claim those words along with other
references to death and suicide pushed the young men into their pact.
   Without evidence of subliminal messages, Whitehead said the case
would not go to trial since music and lyrics are protected by the
First Amendment.
   If subliminal messages do exist within the ``Stained Class''
album, Whitehead said the trial would concentrate on whether such
hidden communication deserves the same First Amendment protection.
   Vance was admitted to the hospital's psychiatric ward Nov. 15 for
treatment of depression and was scheduled to be released last
Thursday, the day he went into a coma.
   An autopsy was pending.

   The Soviet men's chess team and the
Hungarian women's team on Wednesday received their gold medals as
champions of the 28th Chess Olympiad.
   The chief arbiter, Svetazor Gligoric of Yugoslavia, announced
England won the silver medals in the men's competition on a
tie-breaker over the Netherlands, which took the bronze in the
biennial world team championship.
   In addition to their team golds, world champion Garri Kasparov of
the Soviet Union and Judit Polgar of Hungary, the highest ranked
12-year-old in history, each recieved two gold medals for their
brilliant individual results.
   There was laughter from some spectators at the gold medal
ceremony when the Soviet women's team captain, Rima Bilunova, came
forward to collect the two individual silver medals won by Elena
Akhmilovskaya, the second-ranked Soviet player who eloped on
Saturday with John Donaldson of Seattle, captain of the U.S. men's
team. They have flown to Frankfurt, West Germany, en route to the
United States.
   Jeers followed when Bilunova was presented with the silver medal
for Akhmilovskaya's individual performance of eight wins and one
draw.
   Eric Schiller of the American professional chess Assocation,
Pro-Chess, asked the Soviet delegation to pass on Akhmilovkskaya's
individual medal.
   He carried a letter she wrote before her sudden departure, torn
and taped together, giving a U.S. colleague permission to collect
her remaining possessions.
   Vitaly Sevastianov, the president of the Soviet Chess Federation,
said in a message sent via an interpreter that Akhmilovksaya could
only have her medal if she contacted the Soviets directly.
   ``She can call Mrs. Bulinova by phone and ask her personally. She
must do it herself,'' the interpreter said.
   Schiller said he told the Soviet women's captain to ``please take
care of the medal and we will try to arrange for Elena to call.''
   According to chess insiders, the letter had been partially torn
by a member of the Soviet delegation during an altercation earlier
this week with an American who collected Akhmilovskaya's luggage.
   While there has been a degree of sympathy for the Soviets over
the loss of their most successful player at a crucial stage of the
competition, the sentiment appears to have been more than tempered
by a desire among chess fans for a Hungarian victory.
   The loudest ovations from the audience were reserved for Miss
Polgar and the Hungarian team, which also included her two sisters.
   The president of the International Chess Federation, Florencio
Campomanes of the Philippines, said in his closing address, that
``this is the first time in Olympic history that a team of juniors
has won the gold medal.''
   The Hungarian team also featured Miss Polgar's 19-year-old
sister, Zsuzsa, who played on board one, and her 14-year-old sister,
Zsofia. The fourth team member was 19-year-old Ildiko Madl.
   The Soviet men won their competition Tuesday by a crushing
six-point margin with 40{ points out of a possible 56. England and
Netherlands finished with 34{ points.
   The Hungarian women made 33 points out of a possible 42, while
the Soviets dropped a half point behind their rivals in a
nail-biting last round climax to finish on 32{. Yugoslavia took the
bronze.

   Kasparov, 25, who won seven games with three draws, took gold
medals for the highest score on board one and the ``best absolute
individual result,'' in the men's competition. Former world champion
Anatoly Karpov was second.
   Judit Polgar amassed an astonishing total of 12 wins and one
draw. She netted gold medals for the best absolute women's
performance and the highest score on board two.
   The Olympiad, held in Greece's second city located 300 miles

   Nearly 200 leading young Soviets arrive here
Thursday for a week of talks with their U.S. counterparts and for a
taste of football, music and American-style protests.
   The U.S.-U.S.S.R. Emerging Leaders Summit is designed to produce
joint ventures and friendships that will strengthen bonds between
the two superpowers, organizers say.
   ``We've been looking for some of the best emerging leaders in
each of 16 fields,'' said Thomas J. Henry, vice president for
development of the American Center for International Leadership,
which is co-sponsoring the gathering with the Soviet Union's
Committee of Youth Organizations.
   As of Wednesday, 169 Americans and 170 Soviets ages 28 to 40 were
expected, Henry said. The Soviets also were sending about 15
staffers and journalists, he said.
   The delegates will break up into commissions to discuss the arts,
environment, medicine, the military, religion and other topics. They
also will attend part of Saturday's Army-Navy football classic, tour
Independence Hall and attend dinners at the homes of Philadelphians.
   ``The political commissions on both sides are very high-level
now, and all the commissions are composed of people who are likely
to become more important later,'' Henry said. ``It's very possible
that they will be looking at each other across a summit table in the
future.''
   But at least one group is planning to protest the Soviet presence.
   Orysia Hewka, a Ukrainian activist in Philadelphia, said
anti-Soviet picketing is planned outside the hotel where most of the
meetings will occur. She contended the Soviet delegates have been
handpicked and will avoid such topics as religious persecution.
   The Soviet delegation arrived in Chicago on Tuesday for a two-day
visit before flying to Philadelphia. They will go to Washington for
four days after the conference ends Wednesday.
   The American delegates, including congressmen, educators, clergy
and artists, started arriving in Philadelphia on Wednesday.
   This week's meeting of the Supreme Soviet and next week's visit
to the United Nations have forced cancellation of a telecast from
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. But organizers are hoping
President-elect George Bush or Vice President-elect Dan Quayle will
speak, Henry said.
   A reciprocal summit is planned next year in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet delegation includes Viktor Mironenko, head of the
Communist Youth League; Natalya Negoda, star of the
critically-acclaimed ``Little Vera,'' the first Soviet film to
contain an explicit sex scene; and Archimandrite Alexi, head of the
Trinity-St. Sergius Church in Zagorsk, one of the oldest Russian
Orthodox monasteries in the Soviet Union.
   The U.S. delegation includes Deborah Steelman, Bush's chief
health policy adviser during the campaign and a contender to be
Health and Human Services secretary; DePauw University President
Robert Bottoms; and Michael Oppenheimer, senior scientist for the
Environmental Defense Fund.
   At the end of the summit, the conferees will issue a document
called ``The Final Appeal,'' which Henry said would be general in
nature.
   The $550,000 tab for the conference will be paid mostly by
foundations and corporations, although the U.S. Information Agency
is contributing $60,000 for general support, Henry said. Volunteers
are contributing another $150,000 in services and meals, he said.
   The American Center for International Leadership is a non-profit,
non-partisan organization based in Columbus, Ind., which has
organized similar but smaller exchanges since 1983. Its alumni
include new Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth and Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, who will be sworn in as Mexico's president Thursday.

   The General Assembly on Wednesday censured
the United States by a vote of 151-2 and gave it 24 hours to reverse
itself and grant a visa to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat so he can
speak here.
   The world body, spurred on by the Arab nations, will ask for an
extraordinary protest session in Geneva in mid-December to hear the
Palestine Liberation Organization leader if the United States
persists in its refusal, as expected.
   A second resolution to this effect is expected to be voted upon
Friday, or early next week. The reconvened session in Geneva would
be held Dec. 12-16.
   The United States and Israel were alone Wednesday in voting
against the resolution.
   Britain abstained, saying the criticism of its U.S. ally was too
harsh. But all other U.S. allies voted against Washington's position.
   The resolution asked Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to
inform the General Assembly on Thursday of the U.S. response. The
United States says it will defy the resolution.
   The vote in the 159-member assembly was conducted in a rare roll
call ballot requested by Jordan, a departure from the standard
electronic voting.
   Absent were Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, Paraguay and
South Africa.
   The State Department denied a visa to Arafat last Saturday on
grounds he condones and encourages terrorism. Arafat addressed the
world body in 1974.
   Arab diplomats said they will swiftly introduce a new resolution
shifting to Geneva the assembly meeting on the Palestine problem and
the Middle East. Arafat would explain there the recent PLO
declaration of an independent Palestinian state.
   Washington says it does not oppose a move to the Swiss city and
would participate in the debate there. Some diplomats say shifting
the session could set an unfortunate precedent, alienate the United
States and encourage it to deny visas to other U.N. visitors it
considers dangerous or offensive.
   ``I feel very pained to see that the United States is the odd
couple with Israel in the United Nations,'' said Clovis Maksoud,
ambassador of the Arab League, which sponsored the resolution
deploring the U.S. action.
   ``We are hopeful the international outcry against the U.S.
position will jolt the subsequent U.S. administration into a
reassessment of its policies of bias toward Israel.''
   Iraqi Ambassador Ismat Kittani said before the vote that U.S.
failure to change its stand ``will constitute a grievous blow to the
process of peace in the Middle East.''
   He said Secretary of State George P. Shultz now ``has a chance to
rise to the occasion and prevent a grievous wrong, untold injury to
the United Nations and its relations with the host country.''
   But Shultz said earlier Wednesday the United States would not
change its mind.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun, the acting U.N. representative,
told the assembly the U.S. government ``does not agree with the tone
or substance of the resolution and voted against it.''
   ``The denial of a visa to Mr. Arafat is fully consistent with the
Headquarters Agreement between the United States and the United
Nations and this includes our right to protect our national
security,'' Okun said.
   The 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement requires visas to be
granted to U.N. diplomats and people invited on U.N. business.
   The adopted resolution ``deplores the failure by the host country
to approve granting of the requested entry visa,'' and urges the
United States to reconsider and reverse its decision.
   Arafat want to address the assembly to explain the Nov. 15
declaration of an independent Palestinian state and PLO plans for a
Middle East peace settlement.
   He has said he wants to explain the new position taken by the
Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO legislature, in
implicitly recognizing Israel by accepting U.N. resolutions on the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   If the session moves to Geneva, the world body's European
headquarters, it would be the first time the assembly has done so in
protest of an action by the host country. Arab diplomats say they
have the necessary majority to accomplish it.
   The PLO, which has non-voting observer status, has had a U.N.
mission since 1975. The United Nations regards the PLO as the sole
legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and invites it
to speak in debates concerning Palestinians and the Middle East.

<HEAD>Pregnancy Discrimination Leads to $450,000 Judgment Against Transit
Authority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Transit authority bus driver who was denied
restricted duty during her pregnancy and later miscarried has been
awarded $450,000 for mental anguish, the state Division of Human
Rights announced Wednesday.
   Human Rights Commissioner Douglas White called the case ``the
most shocking instance of abuse of an employee by an employer'' in
recent memory. Accordingly, he said, the award was a record high for
mental anguish.
   The authority's disability policy violated state law by treating
pregnant women differently than people with other temporarily
disabling conditions, the state found.
   Authority spokesman Bob Slovak said the pregnancy policy in
question was rescinded years ago. The authority has filed an appeal
in state Supreme Court claiming insufficient evidence of
discrimination and that the award was excessive.
   Bus driver Adrienne Nash of Staten Island learned that she was
pregnant in June 1981 and her doctor advised her not to continue
driving a bus because of her previous history of miscarriage.
   Nash was placed on light duty after an examination by an
authority doctor, but after a week, the same doctor reversed himself
and ordered Nash back to full duty status. She was returned to her
regular bus route without explanation or another examination.
   Nash felt she could not be without a paycheck for seven months,
and she acceded to the transit authority's ``cruel choice,'' White
said.
   Nash drove a bus for nine days before she suffered a miscarriage
on July 16, 1981. She then went on sick leave with pay for one week
and was placed on leave without pay for about two months.
   White said authority regulations in effect at the time required
that all pregnant employees take a leave of absence without pay for
a minimum of one year, while disabled men were routinely place on
reduced duty with pay.
   ``By its unlawfully discriminatory acts respondent (the
authority) created a situation leading complainant (Nash) to have to
live with the thought that her fetus was destroyed because she was a
pregnant worker for an employer who would not deign to grant what
the Human Rights Law provided and required,'' Administrative Law
Judge Matthew Foner said in his opinion, which was adopted by the
Division of Human Rights.
   Nash's decision to continue working ``most likely will continue
to cause her feelings of guilt, feelings of resentment and other
mental anguish about her lost child to the end of her days,'' the
judge wrote.
   Upon her return to work after her miscarriage, the authority
found her psychologically unfit to drive a bus, a status that
prevailed for about nine days. The judge found that this action was
taken by the authority in retaliation for Nash's filing of a
complaint with the Division of Human Rights, according to her
attorney, Kenneth Gordon.
   Nash subsequently learned she was pregnant again in December 1981
and again asked for restricted duty and was again denied. On the
recommendation of the authority doctor, she was forced to take an
unpaid leave of absence until after her due date. She gave birth to
a daughter on Aug. 21, 1982.
   The award includes back pay with interest for her unpaid leave
during her full-term pregnancy, but not for the two months she was
out after her miscarriage.

   Republican political newcomer Craig
James sealed his narrow victory over U.S. Rep. Bill Chappell as the
state Supreme Court on Wednesday turned down the congressman's
request to void a county's votes.
   ``We are delighted we had a victory for the people of the 4th
District,'' James said, adding he had 11 lawyers research state law
for the court challenge. ``To attempt to disenfranchise the voters
of the 4th District is tantamount to being un-American.''
   The state's election canvassing commission, consisting of Gov.
Bob Martinez, Secretary of State Jim Smith, both Republicans, and
Commissioner of Agriculture Doyle Connor, a Democrat, certified the
results last week.
   Chappell's lawsuit, however, delayed sending the 4th
Congressional District results to federal election officials.
   The suit seeking to have Flagler County's results invalidated
claimed the county elections supervisor's office missed a seven-day
deadline to file returns with state elections officials.
   The canvassing commission said it would be unjust to disqualify
voters because of a technicality. Chappell released a brief
statement saying he would have more comment after consulting with
his attorneys.
   ``We are disappointed with the court's ruling today, and now
await the court's (written) opinion,'' the statement said. The high
court planned to issue an opinion explaining its ruling.
   Chappell, a 20-year congressman tainted by reports linking him to
the Pentagon procurement scandal, lost to James by 732 votes in a
recount of the Nov. 8 general election.
   Without the 10,907 votes from Flagler County, Chappell would have
won by 288 votes.
   James, a DeLand lawyer, said in a telephone interview from
Washington that he hopes Chappell will concede and help ``with an
easy transition.''

   The Labor Party's ruling body defied its
two principal leaders Wednesday in a narrow decision against
negotiating with the rival, conservative Likud bloc on a possible
coalition government.
   The 61-57 vote in a closed meeting of Labor's executive bureau
went against the wishes of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a former prime minister, party spokesmen
said. One member abstained.
   Israel radio reported late Wednesday that Likud and the
right-wing Shas party, a small orthodox group, had signed a
coalition agreement giving Shas two Cabinet posts.
   Likud won 40 of the 120 parliament seats in the Nov. 1 election
and Labor got 39. Orthodox religious parties have 18, including six
held by Shas, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the Likud leader,
has been holding coalition talks with them.
   In his proposal to Labor, Shamir had offered two of the four most
powerful Cabinet jobs _ defense and either foreign or finance.
   Shamir said in a statement: ``I'm sorry that we have lost an
opportunity to form a broad government as was the wish of the
majority of the people. Within the next few days I will present to
the Knesset (parliament) a government that will serve well the
people and the country.''
   Labor and Likud have been equal partners in a ``national unity''
coalition since the inconclusive election of July 1984. Peres was
prime minister and Shamir foreign minister during the first two
years, then they switched jobs.
   The Labor decision leaves Shamir the task of making coalition
deals with far-right and ultra-Orthodox parties.
   His offer to Labor of a junior coalition partnership came after
talks with fundamentalist parties bogged down over their demands for
Cabinet posts and a ``Who is a Jew'' law under which only
conversions to Judaism by Orthdox rabbis would be accepted.
   American Jews, more often affiliated with the Conservative or
Reform movements, oppose such a law.
   At the Labor meeting, Rabin said ``it is a serious mistake not to
enter negotiations,'' party spokeswoman Michal Cohen said.
   Many in the party contended, however, that Labor would have to
give up its principles to join a Likud government.
   The current coalition was paralyzed on an approach to peace with
the Arabs because of conflicts between the hard-line Likud and
Labor, which took a more dovish approach.
   Peres and Rabin left immediately after the vote but other
Laborites received the results with loud applause, kissing and
hugging each other and shouting: ``We did it, we did it!'' Israel
radio said.
   The radio described the vote as a ``revolutionary situation'' of
a younger opposition voting against the old party leadership of
Peres and Rabin, who ``got their faces slapped.''

<DATELINE>IRVING, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Boeing aerodynamics expert testified
Wednesday that Delta Flight 1141, which crashed Aug. 31 after
takeoff, had reached sufficient speed to fly even without its wing
flaps in the proper position.
   Ronald J. Halvarson, a supervisor in aerodynamics technology,
told a National Transportation Safety Board public hearing that
Boeing recently ran tests that showed the plane could easily have
become airborne even with a flap configuration that a pilots' union
contends may have caused the crash.
   ``Even in the flaps' up position, the airplane could have been
flyable, in my opinion,'' Halvarson said.
   Paul McCarthy, a lawyer heading the Air Line Pilots Association
delegation, criticized Halvarson's test criteria as insufficient and
said, ``Before you hang these pilots, give us a chance to review
this data.''
   The plane crashed Aug. 31 at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport, killing 14 of the 108 people on board. Survivors included
the three-man crew.
   The position of Flight 1141's wing flaps has become a central
issue in the NTSB inquiry, which will seek information but draw no
conclusions for at least half a year.
   The flaps, located on the trailing edge of the wings to provide
extra lift during the slow speeds of takeoff or landing, were found
in a retracted position after the broken plane slid to a stop about
3,000 feet past the end of the runway.
   The position of the handle that sets the flaps was at odds with
the position in which the flaps were found. Pilots' union officials
have suggested the crew properly set the flap handle but that the
plane crashed just as the flaps were beginning to move into position.
   During Halvarson's appearance before the board, a Delta attorney
interjected that some of the plane's takeoff data was estimated. But
Halvarson said, ``I believe they're close to being correct.''
   Attorney McCarthy said he had not been informed that Boeing had
compiled results of flap configurations from wind tunnel tests to
see if flight would be possible under conditions similar to those
affecting Flight 1141.
   Halvarson said results indicate at least two of the plane's three
engines were flying.
   McCarthy said Halvarson's tests had considered the plane's
thrust, weight and lift, but had ignored a fourth flight variable:
drag.
   The first officer on the flight, Carey W. Kirkland, told the
panel Tuesday that it was his responsibility to put the flaps into a
proper angle for takeoff and that everything had progressed normally.
   ``I'm convinced I did lower the flaps that day,'' said Kirkland,
who explained he was allowed to choose when they would be lowered as
soon as the plane had started two engines and pushed away from the
gate.
   But Kirkland also said, ``I don't remember much about takeoff and
the subsequent crash.''

   Weeping schoolmates of a 12-year-old tornado
victim attended his funeral Wednesday as his mother, her face badly
bruised, clung to a wooden jewelry box her son made in shop class.
   ``Only Pete would give me a present even after he's dead,'' Patty
Fulghum said of her son, Edwin ``Pete'' Fulghum.
   Pete made the box in shop class and signed his name inside,
intending it to be a Christmas present for his mother. A friend
brought it to her.
   Hundreds of relatives and friends mourned the death of the boy,
one of four people killed when tornadoes struck along a 200-mile
stretch of eastern North Carolina Monday. One hundred fifty-seven
people were injured and 850 left homeless. Damage was estimated at
$100 million.
   A funeral for Janet Barnes, 9, of Raleigh, was scheduled for
Wednesday afternoon. Also killed were Lee Roy and Mary Alston of
Nash County, who will be buried Sunday afternoon.
   Also Wednesday, Gov. Jim Martin requested $9.3 million in federal
disaster assistance in a letter to President Reagan that state
officials planned to hand-deliver to the White House.
   The letter asks Reagan for a disaster area declaration that would
make victims eligible for assistance from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
   ``We feel confident that the final determination will be
positive,'' said Joe Dean, Secretary of the state Department of
Crime Control and Public Safety. He said he hoped FEMA would rule on
the application within two days.
   ``What we will do ... hopefully within four days, is set up
disaster assistance centers'' in the affected counties, Dean said.
``Then we will discuss with (tornado victims) what kind of
assistance they can and cannot get.''
   If the application is approved, individuals and families could
receive grants of up to $10,000 per household, loans and housing for
up to 18 months.

   Three men have been arrested and charged with
murder in the death of a man who was killed when a 30-pound block of
concrete was thrown from a highway overpass.
   Kevin DeLorenzo, 19, Matthew Taylor, 19, and Leon DeRouin, 18,
all from the Chicago suburb of Steger, were charged Tuesday.
   Charles Layfield, 57, who had raised eight children on his own,
was on his way home from a hunting trip with two friends
Thanksgiving weekend when the concrete block smashed through the
windshield a pickup truck he was riding in.
   ``All of a sudden I looked up and I saw two guys,'' said the
driver of the truck, Roosevelt Meeks. The next thing he knew, he
said, the windshield was shattered and his friend was dead.
   ``It was, it was horrible,'' said Meeks, who pulled off the road
and flagged down a motorist, who called police.
   Police said an anonymous caller tipped them that the three
teen-agers had talked about the rock-throwing incident at a weekend
party.
   Assistant State's Attorney Dori Leo said the three found the
chunk beside a road and took it to the overpass in the trunk of
their car.
   ``It took a thoughtful act on their part to decide how to
transport the rock to the point where it was thrown,'' she said.
   DeRouin, arrested at his home Tuesday, was being held in the Will
County Jail in lieu of $1 million bond, Will County State's Attorney
Edward Masters said. The other two, held on $250,000 bond each, were
arrested late Monday.

   A drawing by Pablo Picasso sold in London Wednesday
for $1.58 million, which Christie's said they believed was a record
for any drawing by the Spanish-born artist.
   William Hanham, spokesman for the auction house, said it went to
a private buyer who wants to be anonymous.
   The sale came two days after another Picasso work, ``Acrobat and
Young Harlequin,'' in opaque watercolor called gouache, was bought
at Christie's by Japan's Mitsukoshi department store for $38.46
million, the highest price paid at auction for a 20th century work
of art.
   The three-day sale of Impressionist and modern art made a total
of nearly $126 million, Christie's said.
   The Picasso drawing in crayon and pencil depicts a fluted
wineglass, three peaches, playing cards, a cigarette pack and table
napkins.
   Titled ``Still-life with Peaches and Playing Cards,'' it was done
in Avignon, France, in 1914 when Picasso was experimenting with
Cubism in more natural forms.
   The picture was included in a sale of drawings, sculpture, prints
and posters from the collection of the late Douglas Cooper, a
British friend of Picasso and a prolific writer on modern art. The
auction brought $5.68 million, more than three times the presale
estimate.
   ``All the 127 lots were sold and it's been a long time since that
happened,'' Hanham added.
   A brown felt-tip pen drawing by the Russian-born artist Nicolas
de Stael of a vase of flowers, which was little more than a doodle,
was bought by an unidentified telephone bidder for $32,400. Its top
presale estimate was $1,110.
   Other artists represented in the sale included Georges Braque,
Juan Gris, Paul Klee, Fernand Leger and Alberto Giacometti.
   Earlier Wednesday, London art dealer Fred Mulder paid $549,450 at
Christie's for an 1895 lithograph of one of the most famous images
in modern art, ``The Shriek,'' by the Norwegian Edvard Munch and
hand-colored by him.
   The picture, sold anonymously, shows a woman screaming on a
bridge. Its evocation of anguish has become a symbol of the dying
19th century moving toward the new torments of the 20th.
   David Llewellyn, director of the auction firm's print department,
said the price made the work a record for a Munch print and one of
the most expensive prints ever sold.
   In an extraordinary week for London art sales, Christie's rival
Sotheby's on Wednesday sold a collection of 26 small abstract and
human figure bronzes by British sculptor Henry Moore for $1.95
million.
   The collection, sold separately, belonged to Bo Boustedt, a
Swedish architect and photographer.

   A cyclone lashed low-lying coastal areas
of Bangladesh and eastern India, killing at least 317 people and
destroying crops ready for harvest, officials and news reports said
Wednesday.
   The United News of India news agency quoted unidentified
officials in the capital city of Dhaka as saying more than 870
people were killed Tuesday by the storm, including 500 fishermen.
   Strong winds hampered relief and rescue operations Wednesday,
grounding helicopters.
   The cyclone, packing 140 mph winds, brought heavy rain and
whipped waves up to 15 feet.
   Hundreds of mud huts used as homes by fishermen were destroyed.
The toll was expected to rise when reports came in from hundreds of
tiny islands in the Bay of Bengal, said officials in Dhaka.
   ``Extensive damage has been done to the crops ready for
harvesting. Most mud and straw houses and tin-shed offices and
school buildings have been leveled,'' said Abdul Muqtadir Ahmed,
deputy commissioner of southern Khulna district, contacted by phone
from Dhaka.
   Khulna was the worst hit of seven districts affected by the
cyclone.
   Officials at the Cyclone Preparedness Center in Dhaka said the
storm killed 288 people in southern Bangladesh. Press Trust of India
news agency said 29 people died in the east Indian state of West
Bengal.
   Sources at the southern Chittagong port said the
Singapore-registered vessel Pamir sank with 16 crew aboard. Port
officials said the entire crew was presumed dead.
   Food Minister Amjad Hossain said he expected the casualty figures
to rise but that timely evacuation of thousands of people saved
lives.
   ``There will be some casualties in the nearby islands, which have
been swept by storm surges up to 10 feet high,'' said Ahmed.
   A senior official in the president's secretariat in Dhaka said
volunteers of the Red Crescent, the Moslem equivalent of the Red
Cross, evacuated thousands of people before the storm hit. He spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Announcements over public address systems blared every five
minutes to warn residents of the storm's progress. Fishermen were
advised to find a safe place to anchor.
   Officials at the Bangladesh metereological office said the other
coastal districts of Patuakhali, Barguna, Barisal, Bhola, Bagerhat
and Satkhira bore the brunt of the storm.
   Chittagong, about 130 miles southwest of Dhaka, was battered by
strong winds and rain. At least 275 fishermen on 19 boats were
reported missing there.
   Winds up to 75 mph hit Dhaka, a city of 6 million residents,
causing extensive damage to power and telephone lines. The power
outage disrupted city water distribution.
   An official at the meteorological office said the storm weakened
as it crossed Bangladesh and the northeastern districts of India.
   Southern Bangladesh is barely above sea level.
   Press Trust of India reported 24 deaths in the Parganas and
Midnapore districts in West Bengal.
   Quoting official reports, PTI said the cyclone caused extensive
damage to crops and mud houses in the coastal areas.
   ``Our home kept rattling and shaking, we ran out of it when a
section of it collapsed,'' said Ashim Kumar Dey in India's Diamond
Harbour area. Dey, 25, said three of his cows were trapped and
killed in the house.

said.
   The 80-year-old senator has been in St. Luke's Hospitals in Fargo
since Sunday after he suffered a seizure, the cause of which has not
yet been determined.
   Burdick was resting comfortably Wednesday, and his vital signs
were normal, according to a statement released by his office.
   The senator's attending physician, Dr. Janelle Sanda, said the
cause of the seizure may never be known. But tests show no evidence
of tumors, cancer or infection, she said.

   A jury acquitted a 13-year-old girl
Wednesday of murdering another girl after the defendant said she was
elsewhere at the time engaging in sex, drinking and drugs with
teen-age friends.
   The jury at Northampton Crown Court deliberated for more than
seven hours before finding the teen-ager innocent of murder and
manslaughter. Under British law, minors involved in legal cases
cannot be identified.
   Carol Baldwin, 13, died after she was stabbed in the back as she
walked to a friend's house across a park on the evening of March 26
in this northern English community.
   The prosecution claimed the defendant murdered Miss Baldwin, whom
she did not know, because the victim called her a name.
   But the defendant testified she was frightened into wrongly
telling police she committed the murder.
   The accused girl, who was 12 at the time of the killing, said
that while the murder was being committed, she was engaging in sex,
drinking and aerosol-sniffing with older teen-age friends.

<TEXT>
   The trial of the so-called ``Night Stalker''
defendant officially began four months ago, but not a single juror
has been seated as the notorious case stretches into its fourth year.
   Attorneys in the Richard Ramirez case finished asking questions
Wednesday in the second of three phases of jury selection _ an
intensive inquiry into the views of prospective jurors about the
death penalty.
   ``I believe that does it,'' said Superior Court Judge Michael
Tynan as he concluded an interview of the last prospective juror to
be quizzed.
   During Wednesday's session, one woman was excused after she said
the case was giving her nightmares and threatening her health.
   Another woman was allowed to remain although she said she had
consulted with her minister on the troubling question of whether she
could vote for the death penalty if necessary. She said she decided
she could.
   The judge recessed the trial until Dec. 12 when the third phase
of jury questioning begins.
   Testimony about the killings that spread fear throughout Los
Angeles in the summer of 1985 is still months away.
   In Los Angeles and across the country, witnesses wait for a call
from Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin telling them it is
time to recount their ghastly tales of horror.
   Many of their accounts were first told two years ago at a
preliminary hearing for Ramirez, 28, who is from El Paso, Texas. A
judge who heard that testimony about rape, murder and, in one case,
the gouging out of a victim's eyes, ordered Ramirez to stand trial.
   Ramirez, who is said to have dabbled in Satanism and once
shouted, ``Hail Satan!'' in court, faces 13 counts of murder in the
string of nighttime attacks. He also is charged with 30 other
felonies including rape, robbery and attempted murder.
   The shaggy-haired drifter, linked to the crimes through items
stolen from victims' homes, was captured and beaten by angry
residents of an East Los Angeles neighborhood as he tried to steal a
car on Aug. 31, 1985.
   If jurors convict him of even one murder and special circumstance
allegation, they must then decide whether to impose the death
penalty or sentence him to life in prison without parole.
   In spite of the painstaking jury selection, Ramirez' lawyer,
Daniel Hernandez, insists publicity has made it impossible for his
client to receive a fair trial.
   ``We've seen some very fine people come through here,'' Hernandez
said. ``These jurors have made a commitment to be as fair and
impartial as they can be. But it's an impossible position to put
them in.''
   He said many prospective jurors lived in fear when the Night
Stalker crimes were going on.
   ``Because of the (publicity) saturation and the fear and terror
they would be unable to be fair,'' he said.
   Halpin disagrees.
   ``We have been in a process of jury selection since July 21,
1988, and that process has validated our belief that Los Angeles
with its large and diverse population does afford the defendant a
forum in which he can get a fair trial,'' said Halpin.
   So far, more than 1,500 people have been summoned to the
courtroom of Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan. Hundreds were
excused because they could not afford to spend an estimated two
years in court. More were dismissed because they believed Ramirez
was guilty of the ``Night Stalker'' slayings.
   In the latest phase, about 150 prospects were turned away because
of unalterable views for or against the death penalty.
   On Dec. 12, some 145 jury finalists will return for further
questioning on more general subjects. From that pool, 12 jurors and
12 alternates will be chosen. Tynan hopes to seat a jury by
mid-January.

   A scientist who lived for 111 days in an underground
cave emerged from her near-total isolation Tuesday and said she had
become attached to her damp surroundings and even had talked to the
stalactites.
   ``At last! Smells, vegetation and brouhaha!'' Veronique Le Guen,
32, said excitedly when she walked from a cave in l'Aven du
Valat-Negre, in the Aveyron region of southern France to end the
experiment into how isolation affects the body.
   Photographers, television crews and relatives were on hand to
greet Mrs. Le Guen, who had been cut off from the outside world
since Aug. 10 in her campsite 275 feet underground, where the eerie
silence was broken only by the sounds of dripping water and the
beating of her heart.
   Pale and wearing special sunglasses, she had to be helped to a
waiting car that took her to a hospital for medical tests.
   ``Before surfacing, I talked to the cave, I listened for the last
time to the sounds of the water dripping off the stalactites,'' she
said. ``Mixed with the joy of being reunited with my family was a
poignant sadness at leaving this cave which I'd become attached to
after all.''
   The purpose of the experiment was to see how the human body
responds when it is deprived of light and cut off from the natural
cycles of day and night.
   Mrs. Le Guen was wired with electrodes that sent signals to
scientists above ground indicating her sleep cycles and following
the temperature curve of each breast. The data will help medical
researchers in Strasbourg studying tumor detection based on changing
breast temperatures.
   She also collected urine and saliva samples that charted her
body's chemical reactions to caffeine.
   Mrs. Le Guen's only contact with the outside world was through
telephone calls from project head Michel Siffre. But she said they
hurt more than they helped.
   ``The calls put into my ears the sounds of people living without
me, in the free air. I missed that and felt bad about it,'' she said.
   Mrs. Le Guen lived in a large tent equipped with electricity,
three freezers and a stove on which she cooked all her meals. Her
diet was normal _ only chocolate and alchohol were forbidden because
they interfered with her metabolization of caffeine.
   The tent was at the back of a long passage way leading to the
cave's entrance, giving her about 100 yards in which she could
exercise.
   Although she had neither watch nor clock, she said she had the
feeling that time was passing quickly. She thought she had been in
the cave for only 42 days and nights, not 111.
   Christian Vasseur, a computer scientist analyzing data from the
project, said Mrs. Le Guen had ``days'' that lasted 40 hours,
followed by 38 hours of uninterrupted sleep.
   ``In the beginning, I thought I would spend most of my time
thinking about metaphysical questions,'' Mrs. Le Guen said. ``But
when you're alone down there you only think about taking care of
yourself. I cooked, I washed dishes, I read and I wrote a lot.''
   Her fondest memory, she said, was reading Gabriel Garcia
Marquez's ``One Hundred Years of Solitude,'' while the hardest part
of her daily routine was tending to scientific matters.
   ``At the end I couldn't stand it not to be able to urinate in
peace, to have to prick my fingers to take blood samples, to spit
and collect my saliva, to hook up the electrodes before sleeping,
and _ I'll skip the details, much worse,'' she said.
   President Francois Mitterrand sent a telegram congratulating Mrs.
Le Guen for completing a ``great scientific adventure'' and for her
``remarkable personal commitment.''

   An unusual event was declared Wednesday
at the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant when a valve motor failed
in the reactor core cooling spray system, a utility spokesman said.
   The unusual event, the least severe of four nuclear emergency
levels, ``does not denote an emergency and doesn't indicate an
impact on the safety of plant personnel or the general public,''
plant spokesman Gordon Bristol said.
   The unusual event was declared at 5:30 p.m., and repairs to the
valve motor continued more than two hours later. Bristol said the
reactor would be shut down within 24 hours if the motor cannot be
fixed.
   He said Vermont Yankee notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
and officials in Vermont and New Hampshire, part of which lies
within the plant's 10-mile emergency-planning zone.
   Bristol said the plant experienced a similar problem with a core
spray valve motor several months ago.
   Earlier Wednesday, plant spokesman Harry McBrien said the reactor
had begun cutting power by one-quarter of 1 percent per day in
anticipation of a Feb. 11 shutdown.

   The Justice Department announced Wednesday it
plans to return five Mariel Cuban detainees to their island homeland
on Thursday, resuming a repatriation program that began in 1984.
   The five, being held at the federal Correctional Institution in
Talladega, Ala., were among the 125,000 Cubans who came to the
United States in the 1980 Mariel boatlift.
   Lawyers for three of the five on Wednesday night were seeking a
stay from the Supreme Court to block their return to Cuba, one of
their attorneys, Gary Leshaw of Atlanta, said in an interview.
Leshaw said he anticipated a decision by the court on Thursday
morning on whether to issue an emergency stay involving the three.
   The five were to be sent by bus Thursday from Talladega to
Birmingham, Ala., where they were to be flown to an airport near
Havana, Cuba, at mid-afternoon Thursday, said Deborah Burstion-Wade,
a Justice Department spokeswoman.
   Some 50 people were to be aboard the plane, a U.S. Marshals
Service aircraft departing from the Alabama Air National Guard area
of the airport at Birmingham, she said. The party was to include
deputy U.S. marshals, immigration and bureau of prisons officials.
   Cuba had suspended the repatriation program in 1985 after taking
back 201 people.
   Cuba had agreed to accept a total of 2,746 Mariel Cubans.
   The five were to be flown to Cuba after a three-member panel of
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied their request for an
emergency stay of a U.S. District Court opinion permitting their
return.
   The five had gone to the federal courts after Justice Department
review panels said they should be repatriated.
   The panels were established in the aftermath of riots by Cuban
detainees in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., a year ago which were
triggered by plans to resume deportation of the prisoners to Cuba.
   So far, the panels have decided that 15 detainees should be
repatriated to Cuba and the five to be returned Thursday are among
those 15.
   The three who are seeking a Supreme Court stay are:
   _Miguel Beitia-Socarraz, 28, who pleaded guilty to a charge of
second-degree burglary for robbing a commercial establishment. One
prison evaluation stated he was very prison-hardened and street-wise.
   _Onel Calzado-Garlobo, 43, convicted in 1982 of attempted sexual
assault charges involving a 13-year-old girl.
   _Rene Maurin-Oliva, 25, who pleaded guilty to theft and battery
and whose mental health evaluations suggest he suffers from
borderline personality disorders.
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon in Birmingham, Ala.,
rejected appeals from Beitia-Socarraz, Calzado-Garlobo, and Maurin
Oliva. Clemon turned aside arguments that the three had been denied
hearings on their claims to political asylum in the United States.
   Leshaw is seeking an emergency stay in a separate case in which
he argues that the Cuban detainees have a right to appeal to federal
court the Justice Department review panels' decisions on
repatriation. That right, says Leshaw, comes under the
Administrative Procedure Act.
   The other two facing repatriation Thursday, about whom no details
were immediately available, are Hector Hernandez-Quesada and Angel
Meneses-Hernandez.

   Two Harvard University computer experts
appeared Wednesday before a federal grand jury that is investigating
the origin of a computer virus that jammed a nationwide network of
computers.
   The investigation is focused on Cornell University graduate
student Robert Morris Jr., 23, of Washington, D.C., who authorities
believe created the virus.
   The virus program transmitted copies of itself from computer to
computer, cramming an estimated 6,000 computers nationwide. It
caused at least $97 million in damage, because of interrupted work
on computers that had to be shut down, and in the work needed to
resuscitate the computers, according to the Computer Virus Industry
Association.
   FBI agents in Massachusetts last week subpoenaed three people at
Harvard, where Morris was a computer science undergraduate until
June.
   Two of them, graduate student Paul Graham and computer programmer
Andrew H. Suddeth, appeared Wednesday afternoon before the grand
jury.
   Suddeth has said that Morris called him in a panic to get help in
getting out a message to other computer operators after he realized
what the virus was doing.
   Suddeth on Tuesday said he wanted to stop commenting publicly
until he had appeared before the grand jury.
   The third person subpoenaed, Mark Friedell, an associate
professor of computer science at Harvard, was excused from
testifying. He said he told prosecutors he knew nothing of Morris'
alleged involvement with the virus.
   Friedell was an adviser to Morris when Morris researched and
wrote an undergraduate thesis about computers.
   A week ago, federal agents seized computer tapes from files
Morris had at Harvard. The files, which are accessible to computers
located off the Harvard campus, were created and edited a week
before the virus clogged the network.
   On Nov. 10, FBI agents in Ithaca executed two other search
warrants at Cornell, seizing computer tapes and notes that agents
believe are linked to the creation of the virus.
   Morris' lawyer, Thomas Guidoboni of Washington, told the
newspaper that Morris has not been subpoenaed to appear before the
grand jury in Syracuse.
   Guidoboni so far has advised Morris not to talk with anyone about
the virus, including FBI agents. However, the lawyer said an
agreement may soon be reached in which an interview with agents
would be arranged.
   Guidoboni said he was uncertain where Morris would be interviewed.
   ``I think the FBI would like to talk with him,'' Guidoboni said.
``But I'm not aware specifically what they'd like to talk to him
about.''

   A special card given to some employees at
California's second-largest bank may have been used at automated
teller machines to steal nearly $350,000 from about 300 customer
accounts, authorities said Wednesday.
   The money was withdrawn over the Veterans Day weekend, Nov.
11-13, bank officials said. It is believed to be the largest theft
of its kind.
   Security Pacific spokeswoman Deborah K. Lewis refused Wednesday
to say what type of card may have been involved. She said the bank
has referred the matter to authorities.
   The FBI said Wednesday that the Secret Service had taken over the
investigation. Secret Service Special Agent Don Chacos said the
Secret Service handles violations involving fraudulent use of access
devices to steal funds from another person.
   He refused to say anthing about the investigation other than to
add, ``They used a device to circumvent the normal procedure'' to
withdraw funds.
   Ms. Lewis said the bank reimbursed about 300 depositors after
discovering through an ongoing audit that almost $350,000 was
stolen. She would not say how many branches were hit.
   ``They were primarily concentrated in Southern California,'' she
said.
   Steev J. Pears, a Hollywood cameraman, said he discovered Tuesday
that $1,200 had been illegally withdrawn from his account. He said
the money was withdrawn in separate transactions that seemed to take
place at more than one automatic teller machine.
   ``I was really hot when I saw that,'' said Pears, who has an
account at a Security Pacific branch in Malibu. ``I went to the
branch and was screaming at the manager. She told me that they
thought it had to be an inside job. That was the phrase she used,
`inside job.'''
   Ms. Lewis declined to say whether a bank employee or employees
are at the center of the investigation.
   ``I can't say that it was an inside job,'' she said. ``That
hasn't been totally determined. The exact details of how this thing
occurred are still under investigation.''
   Security Pacific, the state's second-largest bank after Bank of
America, has instituted security procedures to prevent similar
thefts, Ms. Lewis said.

thief calls police, details</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   An Impressionist painting worth more than $1
million that was stolen from a museum was recovered Wednesday in New
York City when a tearful thief called police, authorities said.
   The bandit, however, described as ``remorseful, crying and
upset,'' was not regretful enough to turn himself in, said Suffolk
County Police Detective Sgt. Gene Gross, who took two calls from the
man.
   The man called police at 8:45 a.m. to tell them they should find
a claim adjuster because he had information about the painting,
Edouard Manet's ``Bouquet of Peonies,'' which was stolen Sunday from
the Heckscher Museum in Huntington.
   He called back at 9:30 a.m. and told police the painting was at
an apartment complex in the borough of Queens, Gross said.
   Suffolk County Police Commissioner Daniel Guido said the thief
told police the painting could be found in the basement laundry room
but it was not there when police arrived shortly before noon.
   He said Benjamin Pagan, the building superintendent, had found
it, thought about hanging it in his apartment, but decided to put in
it a storage room because he didn't think it was attractive.
   Heckscher museum Registrar William Titus said Wednesday the
painting was authentic and undamaged.
   Investigators said the painting was taken from the wall of the
museum probably as patrons in the room watched a videotape about
another exhibit. Two uniformed guards were patrolling the five-room
exhibition area at the time, Kiley said.
   The 1880 Manet painting is a still life of red and pink flowers
in a glass vase. It had been lent to the Heckscher by its anonymous
owner.
   The full estimated value of the painting was not made public, but
police and museum officials said it was more than $1 million.
   The painting, in its frame, measures about 16{ by 21{ inches and
could have fit under a coat, Kiley said Monday.

   A jet fighter's gun fired by mistake
Wednesday, setting six planes ablaze on the USS Nimitz flight deck
and killing a sailor, but crews averted disaster by dousing the
flames quickly, U.S. officials said.
   A second crewman was severely burned in the fire, which was
brought under control in about 20 minutes, Navy spokesmen reported.
They said a cannon on an A-7 Corsair was fired accidentally during
``troubleshooting maintenance'' aboard the carrier in the Arabian
Sea.
   The 20mm shell exploded against another parked plane, starting a
fire that eventually spread to six aircraft, A-6 Intruders and A-7s
that suffered ``minor to major damage,'' according to the reports.
   One of the damaged aircraft was a KA-6 Intruder tanker, fitted
for air-to-air refueling, but the officials said they did not know
whether it was the one hit by the shell.
   A-7 fighter-bombers are among the Navy's older combat planes, and
carry two 20mm guns.
   Navy spokesmen said the accident early Wednesday would not affect
operations of the nuclear-powered carrier, which arrived Oct. 29,
leading an eight-ship battle group assigned to support U.S. naval
units in the Persian Gulf.
   The 90,944-ton Nimitz was launched in 1975 as the first in the
Navy's newest class of supercarriers. It caries about 6,000 men,
including pilots and aircraft maintenance personnel, and its home
port is Bremerton, Wash.
   Wednesday's accident evoked memories of the worst carrier flight
deck disaster since World War II, a fire on the USS Forrestal off
Indochina in 1967.
   That fire was started by a missile mistakenly launched by a plane
preparing for a bombing raid on North Vietnam. It killed 134
sailors, injured 64 and destroyed dozens of planes in an inferno of
burning fuel and exploding ammunition.
   It was the Nimitz's second fatal accident. On May 25, 1981, a
Marine Corps jet crashed on its flight deck during operations off
Florida, killing 14 men.
   Officials said fire control teams may have prevented another
calamity Wednesday by containing the blaze quickly.
   Many of the carrier's more than 80 aircraft were parked on the
flight deck when the cannon fired at 2:50 a.m. (7:50 p.m. EST
Tuesday), officials said.
   ``From all indications, it's clear that the quick action was
responsible for avoiding a much worse situation, even a disaster,''
one officer said, on condition his name not be used.
   ``There have been some bad fires on carriers, and we've all heard
the old Navy saying that working on a carrier flight deck is
probably the world's first or second most dangerous occupation.''
   Another officer said, also privately: ``When you've got all that
ammunition, fuel and so on, it can turn real ugly in no time.''
   Petty Officer Joe Bartlett, a spokesman for the Navy's Joint Task
Force Middle East, said an investigation was being conducted.
   He said the injured seaman was taken to a U.S. military hospital
in West Germany. Sources said the sailor had burns on 70 percent of
his body.
   In Washington, Navy officials identified the dead sailor as
Aviation Structural Mechanic 2nd Class Douglas Scott Dimberg, 23, of
Redfield, S.D. The injured man was identified as Airman Apprentice
Chadwick Raymond Henderson, 19, of Rockford, Ill.
   Officials said they did not know immediately how Dimberg was
killed.
   Fifty Americans have been killed in Persian Gulf operations since
mid-1987, when U.S. naval forces were expanded to meet growing
threats to commercial shipping in the Iraq-Iran war.
   Thirty-seven died in a mistaken Iraqi air strike May 17,1987, on
the missile frigate USS Stark and 12 were killed in helicopter and
airplane crashes.
   Of the total, four have been killed since a cease-fire in the
8-year-old war began Aug. 20. Three Navy airmen died Nov. 11 when
their helicopter crashed in the Arabian Sea while preparing to land
on the frigate USS Barbey, a member of the Nimitz battle group.
   In 1983, six sailors were killed and 35 injured by an engine room
fire aboard the USS Ranger in the Arabian Sea.

   A warrant was issued Wednesday for a
former New Jersey resident wanted in the deaths of three people who
were gunned down inside a bagel shop, police said.
   The warrant was issued for Nathan Trupp, 42, said police
spokeswoman Mary Molina Mescall. Ms. Mescall did not know where in
New Jersey Trupp was from.
   Richard Wilt, 39, his wife, Jeanne Wilt, 37, and the woman's
father, Joseph Famiglietta Sr., 63, were killed Tuesday by a gunman
who walked into the victims' bagel shop and opened fire.
   No motive was known, police said.
   Two other people in the shop were not harmed or threatened,
officers said, and no money was taken.
   Famiglietta moved to Albuquerque from Commack, N.Y., on Long
Island, in 1980. The Wilts moved to the city last year from Commack
and opened the bagel shop.

<HEAD>Walesa, Miodowicz Hold Unprecedented TV Debate on Unions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa urged the government Wednesday
night in an unprecedented TV debate with the head of Poland's
official unions to legalize Solidarity, the banned labor federation
he helped found in 1980.
   The debate after the evening news represented the first time in
five years that Walesa, the 1983 Nobel Peace laureate, had a chance
to defend Solidarity on state-controlled television and was his most
extensive TV appearance ever.
   The exchange was televised live and uncensored. A clock was even
placed in the background of the set to demonstrate that no deletions
were made.
   Jubilant Solidarity advisers declared victory afterward. Hundreds
of spectators who crowded around television sets at Warsaw's Central
Station also seemed to score it a win for Walesa.
   ``We have to agree for Poland. Poland needs agreement,'' Walesa
told Alfred Miodowicz during the 43-minute debate.
   Referring to Miodowicz's membership in the ruling Politburo,
Walesa said serious talks between the opposition and government
could begin when officials acknowledge Solidarity's right to exist.
   Soldarity, the first free union movement in the Soviet bloc, was
founded legally during a turbulent summer of strikes in 1980, but
was suppressed and outlawed after martial law was declared in
December 1981.
   ``If you can make a man's decision that there is a place for
Solidarity, we will immediately roll up our sleeves and we will
begin working hard for Poland, because time is running out,'' Walesa
told Miodowicz.
   Grzegorz Streszynski, a young man at the railroad station, missed
his train to western Poland to watch the contest. ``Walesa made
great remarks. I waited seven years to hear them,'' he said.
   Walesa ``stepped on him,'' said Adam Michnik, a senior adviser to
the Solidarity founder.
   ``This is a fantastic day, beautiful, which will be noted in the
history of our country as a great victory for Solidarity,'' said
film director Andrzej Wajda, a Solidarity supporter.
   Walesa said later his performance suffered because he had a
severe case of flu.
   The official news agency PAP was noncommittal: ``In spite of the
fact that the approaches remained divergent, the very fact of the
meeting is a good prognosis for overcoming barriers in reaching .. .
dialogue and national agreement.''
   Dressed in a gray suit, with a Solidarity badge and an image of a
madonna on his lapel, Walesa looked relaxed as he and Miodowicz sat
side by side.
   Miodowicz began the program, urging that there be no divisions
among workers.
   ``Please join us (in the official trade unions.) Join our
democratic elections,'' said Miodowicz, who wore a black shirt and
no tie with a gray suit.
   Walesa said: ``You want me to come on my knees to your union. I
don't want to. I want to be myself.''
   As the debate progressed, Walesa became more animated, gesturing
broadly with his hands. Miodowicz's opening remarks lasted five
minutes longer than Walesa's, but the Solidarity leader did most of
the talking afterward.
   When Miodowicz said authorities were moving step by step to
improve the political and economic situation in Poland, Walesa
agreed but said Poland was taking small steps while the rest of the
world rushed toward progress.
   The debate was proposed by Miodowicz on Nov. 14 and accepted
swiftly by Walesa. A television official had predicted that all of
Poland would come to a halt to see the confrontation.
   In addition to being head of the alliance, created by the
government in 1982 to replace the banned Solidarity, Miodowicz, a
59-year-old former steelworker, is a member of the ruling Politburo
of the Polish United Workers (Communist) Party.
   Until this year, Walesa had been treated as virtually a
non-person by authorities and was not permitted into Polish TV
studios.
   Walesa, 45, has led Solidarity since its creation in 1980 when it
grew into a 10 million-member labor movement, the first independent
union in the East bloc.
   Despite being outlawed under martial law, Solidarity has remained
active, first as an underground organization and more openly since
1986. Union supporters staged two waves of strikes this year and
demanded it be made legal again.
   Walesa and Miodowicz differ fundamentally on trade union issues.
Miodowicz says there can be only one union in one factory.
   Walesa advocates allowing official unions and independent unions
like Solidarity to co-exist in factories, but to negotiate jointly
with management.

<HEAD>France Detonates One of Biggest Nuclear Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France detonated one of its
biggest nuclear explosions in the South Pacific on Thursday, and New
Zealand quickly condemned the test as dangerous.
   Government scientists in New Zealand estimated the blast had a
yield of 100 kilotons. France's biggest recorded test measured 140
kilotons.
   The scientists said the test appeared to be the biggest since a
120-kiloton explosion in 1979 at Mururoa, an atoll in French
Polynesia.
   One kiloton is equivalent to the explosion of 1,000 tons of TNT.
   Foreign Minister Russell Marshall of New Zealand said the latest
test, the eighth this year, renewed questions about the safety of
the test site. Government officials said the explosion was for the
first time at Faungataufa atoll, not the usual Mururoa site.
   ``The fact that the French test their nuclear weapons so far from
their own country suggests an uncertainty about the risks of their
nuclear testing, and moving this nuclear test back to Faungataufa
merely raises more questions,'' said Marshall in a statement.
   Marshall said France probably was developing warheads for a new
mobile land-based ballistic missile or a new submarine-launched
ballistic missile.
   ``Nuclear testing merely fuels the arms race,'' he added. ``We
will continue to deplore it wherever and whenever it occurs. Further
development of more and more nuclear weapons does not guarantee
anybody's security.''
   France maintains a policy of not confirming reports of nuclear
testing. It began underground testing at Mururoa in 1975 after
abandoning atmospheric tests.

   A man was struck and killed by a city bus
Wednesday, and his body was dragged more than seven blocks and
through at least five stops without the driver or passengers knowing
it, police said.
   The body of the victim, a man in his 50s, was eventually
discovered in the street by police officers, said Louis Cella of the
police Major Accident Investigation Section.
   ``The bus driver and the 30 to 35 people on board the bus were
totally unaware of what had happened,'' Cella said. ``Nobody felt
anything and nobody saw anything.''
   Cella said the innermost tire on the right rear wheel struck the
man's head and his body was caught on the suspension.
   Two city transit employees traveling behind the bus saw something
drop from the undercarriage but didn't realize it was a body, said
Chicago Transit Authority spokesman Jeff Stern.
   Police were withholding the man's identification until family
members could be notified.
   Cella said police were convinced that the bus driver did not know
an accident had occurred and no charges were filed against him.

<HEAD>Revival of Lanford Wilson's `The Rimers of Eldritch' Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a tiny Midwestern hamlet called Eldritch,
population 70, the people can be friendly, caring and close-knit.
They also can be gossipy, insular, unforgiving and downright
murderous.
   Lanford Wilson examines a dozen or so of the town's residents in
``The Rimers of Eldritch,'' which was revived Wednesday by
off-Broadway's Second Stage. The play still tantalizes, but this
production doesn't. It's a fluid but emotionally barren revival that
doesn't capture the power of Wilson's dark story or his poetic,
almost lyrical sense of everyday language.
   ``The Rimers of Eldritch'' is early Wilson, a large, messy play
that was first performed off-off-Broadway at LaMama in 1966. The
evening is an unsentimental mosaic of rural life. But nothing is
straightforward. Scenes bleed into each other. Conversations overlap
and sometimes are repeated. Action occurs in a time frame that skips
from spring to summer to fall and back again.
   Ultimately, pieces of the story fit together, building toward a
climax that has been hinted at from the beginning of the play. Until
then, the audience has to absorb a remarkable number of characters
and incidents.
   The opening sequence is promising. Two old biddies, played with
hilarious righteousness by Georgia Creighton and Mary Jay, cackle
about the goings-on between the owner of the town cafe and her
amorous hired hand.
   Gradually, the rest of the large cast is introduced.
   There's Patsy Johnson, described by the playwright as ``the
prettiest girl at Centerville High.'' Patsy longs to move to
Centerville, some 20 miles away, but she's trapped in Eldritch, and
can only leave on a school bus.
   Her speeches of longing, particularly when recited by an actress
as sympathetic as Jennie Moreau, are among the production's few
affecting moments.
   There's also a parade of eccentric characters who seem, in this
revival at least, to reside in Dogpatch rather than Eldritch. They
include Skelly, the town hermit; the emotionally unstable Nelly
Windrod and her senile mother Mary; the ultra-religious Evelyn
Jackson and her crippled daughter Eva, and a strange young man named
Robert Conklin who is amorously pursued by Eva.
   The plot involves a murder and a subsequent trial. Neither is
presented chronologically, and information about both is revealed
between slices of Midwest life, often performed at much too high a
pitch.
   Director Mark Brokaw hasn't gotten much out of his actors besides
an ability to scamper up and down designer Santo Loquasto's mountain
of rough-hewn boards. In addition to Miss Moreau, only Adam Storke
as the troubled Robert evokes much sympathy or interest. Even
Jennifer Tipton's lighting seems unrealized, more murky than
revealing.
   As an examination of small-time people in a small-town,
oppressive atmosphere, ``The Rimers of Eldritch'' remains
intriguing. It's just hard to see what makes them tick in this
leaden production.

<DATELINE>SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marcia Gray, a comatose woman kept
alive near three years by a feeding tube while her family
successfully fought to stop feeding her, died Wednesday after
surviving two weeks without nourishment.
   Mrs. Gray, 49, died at 8:18 p.m. at South County Hospital in
South Kingstown, said Philip Tracy, the hospital's senior vice
president.
   ``Death was attributed to kidney failure and respiratory
arrest,'' he said. ``Most of the family were with her,'' including
her husband, H. Glenn Gray, who fought for his wife's right to die.
   ``Her family was all with her and Glenn was able to hold her. It
was a very quiet, peaceful passage,'' said the family's attorney,
Linda MacDonald.
   ``He's taking it pretty hard. He said, `It's an easy passage for
her, but it's not for us.' He's not going to be talking to anybody
for a while, probably for at least a week,'' Ms. MacDonald said.
   Along with Gray, 47, were Mrs. Gray's 23-year-old son,
21-year-old daughter and about eight other relatives and in-laws,
Ms. MacDonald said.
   Her death was the final chapter in her family's controversial
appeal to a federal judge and a Roman Catholic theologian that Mrs.
Gray did not want her life prolonged artificially.
   Mrs. Gray suffered a burst blood vessel in her brain on Jan. 4,
1986. She has been in what doctors called ``a persistent vegetative
state'' since then, confined mostly at the state General Hospital.
   Gray and other family members contended throughout the
controversy that Mrs. Gray told them before she was stricken that
she did not want to be kept alive by artificial means.
   State officials refused to remove her feeding tube, arguing it
was morally wrong that she endure a cruel and painful death by
starvation.
   The Gray family then sued the state in an attempt to force
officials to let Mrs. Gray die. U.S. District Judge Francis J. Boyle
on Oct. 17 sided with the family and ordered the state to remove the
feeding tube or find another hospital that would by Nov. 16.
   Bishop Louis E. Gelineau of the Providence Roman Catholic
Diocese, drew national attention last year when he approved a
theologian's opinion that it was morally permissible to withhold
nutrition from Mrs. Gray.
   After the federal decision, Thomas Romeo, state director of the
Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals, still
expressed reluctance in removing Mrs. Gray's nutrition. He wrote to
more than 270 hospitals in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and
Connecticut, asking them to accept Mrs. Gray.
   She was transfered to South County Hospital on Nov. 16. Dr.
Robert Conrad, who has worked at South County for 23 years, removed
the tube. He said at the time that he was concerned Mrs. Gray was
being kept alive against her wishes.
   Tracy said Mrs. Gray's death was expected.
   ``Right from day one she's been deteriorating, but the past few
days, more so,'' he said. ``There's not much more you can say. It's
done and other with.''
   He said there were no attempts to resuscitate Mrs. Gray on
Conrad's orders.
   The family began a bedside vigil Monday after several instances
when Mrs. Gray's blood pressure dropped sharply and her heart began
beating irregularly, Ms. MacDonald said.
   ``She kept rallying. This morning they thought she was going and
she held on for another 12 hours,'' the lawyer said. ``Every one of
her organs was beginning to shut down, from what the doctors said.''
   Ms. MacDonald said that although it has been painful for the
family, Gray ``is proud of the fact that his wife did not die in
vain, that Marcia's death, as unprivate as it was, opened the path
for other families not to go through the same thing.''
   At one point in the state's attempts to find a health care
facility tht would take Mrs. Gray, Romeo sought the advice of U.S.
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.
   Koop, who had said that although he didn't endorse the removal of
patients' feeding tubes in general, the Gray family's request was
acceptable because Mrs. Gray had previously asked to be allowed to
die.

   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a Mexican
nationalist with U.S. academic training, becomes Mexico's president
Thursday and begins a race against time to restructure his country
economically, politically and psychologically.
   Six years of economic crisis and austerity have fed discontent
and political opposition. Salinas himself has said that the ``future
of the system'' _ a system that has served Mexico for almost 60
years _ is at stake.
   With Cabinet appointments announced Wednesday, however, Salinas
served notice that he intends to extend free-market policies.
Several young appointees worked with Salinas under outgoing
President Miguel de la Madrid and, like Salinas, hold degrees in
economics from top-ranked U.S. schools.
   When he takes the oath in the legislative palace for his six-year
term, Salinas will look out at an example of how times have changed.
Out of 500 congressmen, 263 belong to his Institutional
Revolutionary Party and an unprecedented 237 to the opposition.
   Salinas' victory July 6 with just over 50 percent of the vote was
marred by accusations of fraud, and the result still is being
protested. Over the weekend members of the National Democratic Front
occupied city halls in Michoacan state.
   Only last week Democratic Front presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas labeled Salinas an ``illegitimate president'' and said
foreign heads of state such as Cuba's Fidel Castro should not be
attending the inauguration.
   Salinas needs a quick success to demonstrate his command of the
job, but he is taking over a country with a foreign debt of $102
billion, an economy that has not grown in six years and an annual
inflation rate of 40 percent.
   To help him move forward, Salinas selected a Cabinet to include
Pedro Aspe, a 38-year-old with a Ph.D. from M.I.T., as treasury
secretary and chief of debt negotiations; Jaime Serra Puche, a
37-year-old who worked for Salinas in the budget office, as minister
of commerce and industry; and close associate Fernando Solana, 57,
as foreign minister.
   Other appointments included Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, 36,
who has been Aspe's assistant secretary and who holds a Yale
doctorate, as budget secretary; Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, 61,
governor of Veracruz state and former assistant interior secretary,
as interior secretary; Gen. Antonio Riviello Bazan, 62, a career
officer, as defense secretary; and economist Andres Caso Lombardo,
64, as communications and transportation secretary.
   Salinas named his closest collaborator, 42-year-old Manuel
Camacho Solis, as mayor of sprawling Mexico City and its population
of 18 million, which the PRI lost badly in the July elections.
   Despite all his difficulties, there are signs that Salinas may
have an easier time than de la Madrid, whose biggest accomplishment
was to stop an economic downslide and prevent social unrest.
   De la Madrid, with Salinas as budget director, reduced the
government's control of the economy, sold off state-owned companies
and pushed efforts to free Mexico of its dependence on oil revenue
by making its industry more competitive on world markets.
   ``The difference between now and six years ago is that today
people are confident we can pull out of the crisis.'' said Ramon
Alatorre, an official with Howard Johnson of Mexico, a restaurant
and motel franchiser.
   Salinas has said his biggest concern is ``to get Mexico to grow
again,'' and to do that, he said, the country needs both new
investment and the use of resources that now go abroad as payments
on the foreign debt.
   He expects a sympathetic ear from President-elect George Bush,
whom he met last week in Houston. Mexico will pay $9 billion in
interest on the debt this year, and Salinas says creditors must be
more understanding.
   The new Mexican president called Bush a man ``with a positive
attitude.'' Mexican sources at the meeting said the Mexican leader,
a Harvard graduate with a doctorate in economics, and Bush, a Yale
alumnus, seemed to ``hit it off.'' They also discussed other
irritants to U.S.-Mexico relations: drug trafficking, migration and
free trade.
   Salinas is expected to continue austerity measures recommended by
international financial institutions to pull Mexico out of its
crisis and keep trying to make the economy more efficient.
   In a show of confidence, the United States offered a $3.5 billion
credit. Mexico has not yet needed to draw on the money, but the
psychological effect was positive.
   Present at the inauguration will be eight Latin American chiefs
of state; the attendance of Castro and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega is
particularly annoying to leftists who question Salinas' mandate.
   The U.S. delegation will include Secretary of State George P.
Shultz and Bush's son John, who will come with his Mexican-American
wife Columba.
   Others attending will be presidents Virgilio Barco of Colombia,
Raul Alfonsin of Argentina, Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador,
Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras, Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo of Guatemala
and Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel of Belize.

<HEAD>Faulty Seals And Gaskets Cause Plutonium Leaks At SRP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaky seals and gaskets caused a series of
plutonium leaks at the government's Savannah River Plant in Aiken
County, S.C., and more leaks could occur before the problem is
fixed, scientists said Wednesday.
   Three separate unplanned releases of plutonium have occurred at
the nuclear weapons material production plant in the past six weeks
_ the most recent on Nov. 22. Fifteen workers have picked up minute
quantities of the radioactive material on the soles of their shoes
as a result of the leaks.
   John Porter, a technical superintendent at the plant near
Augusta, Ga., told The Atlanta Constitution Wednesday the source of
the releases appears to be a contaminated filter room at a
laboratory near SRP's plutonium refining facility.
   Over a period of years, plutonium had built up in the room as
filters designed to trap radioactivity were replaced. Some of the
accumulated plutonium then was sucked accidentally out of the lab's
exhaust air stack without passing through filters.
   The accidental releases occurred because several seals and
gaskets that should have been airtight were not, Porter said.
   Since the first leak was discovered in late October _ after six
workers had gone home with plutonium on their shoes _ air flow
through the laboratory has been restricted and gaskets in the filter
room have been replaced.
   As a result, Porter said the chances of more releases occurring
have been reduced but not eliminated. ``It's unlikely that more will
be released, but it's not impossible,'' Porter said.
   One microcurie of plutonium has been found outside of a plutonium
refining facility, according to SRP officials. If all of that had
been swallowed by a single person, that person would receive only
about one-third of the radiation dose permitted by federal
regulations.
   However, Bill Reinig, SRP health physics superintendent,
acknowledged that some plutonium could have escaped from the plant
without being measured.
   None of the three reactors at SRP are operating. They have been
shut down because of safety and other concerns.

   The Du Pont Co. hopes to get federal approval
next week to market a solution which in clinical trials increased
the time that livers, pancreases and kidneys can be preserved before
transplanting, a scientist said Wednesday.
   Dr. James H. Southard of the University of Wisconsin, who helped
develop UW Solution, said during a telephone interview from Madison,
Wis., that the solution will mean more livers preserved for shipment
to transplant centers.
   ``It means the surgery can be scheduled and done during the
normal hours of the operating room. It means a well-rested staff, a
more expeditious operation and a safer operation,'' Southard said.
   Organ transplants are generally done on an emergency basis
shortly after organs become available, which is often unpredictable
and inconvenient.
   With the solution, organs begin to function immediately after a
transplant, eliminating the need for dialysis for kidney patients or
insulin for those with tranplanted pancreases, Southard said.
   Survival rates for those with transplanted livers would increase
because the livers would work immediately, he said.
   Prior to the development of the solution, livers and pancreases
could be preserved from six to 10 hours, while kidneys could be
preserved for about 30 hours.
   ``A lot of organs were wasted because we couldn't transport them
fast enough,'' Southard said. The new solution preserves kidneys and
pancreases for three days and livers for two days, he said.
   At the University of Pittsburgh Hospital, where the solution has
been used for about a year, more than 450 liver transplants have
been done and livers have been preserved for more than 30 hours,
Southard said.
   In 1987, there were 8,967 kidney tranplants, 1,199 liver
transplants and 142 pancreas tranplants, according to the
not-for-profit United Network for Organ Sharing in Richmond, Va.
   Although it is believed the number of transplants will probably
increase as a result of the solution, UNOS spokeswoman Kelle M.
Straw said only 15 to 20 percent of the potential pool of donors is
being used.
   ``I think (the solution) will help in the area of allowing more
time for tissue typing and coordinating flights and getting an organ
to its destination,'' she said.
   UNOS, a national clearinghouse for organ donors and recipients,
has been tracking the clinical trials of the new solution. Tests are
under way to determine if the solution would also work on hearts.
   Southard, an associate professor in the Department of Surgery at
the University of Wisconsin, developed the solution with Dr. Folkert
O. Belzer, chairman of the department.
   The solution uses chemicals invented by Du Pont, which is
headquartered in Wilmington. The solution has been used in clinical
trials in the United States, Europe and Canada since January, Du
Pont spokesman Roger Morris said.
   If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not object or
request further information about the product on Monday, Du Pont
plans to begin commercially marketing the solution to hospitals and
transplant centers in February, Morris said.

   A campaign to secure Iran's full
cooperation with the U.N. human rights investigator collapsed
Wednesday when a committee adopted a resolution harshly critical of
the Tehran government's practices.
   Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, said last
Friday his country was ready to allow U.N. special representative
Reynaldo Galindo Pohl to tour Iran in December if a mild consensus
resolution were adopted.
   Iran has never allowed Galindo into the country, and he has had
to compile his reports from Iranian news reports and the testimony
of exiles.
   When the resolution criticizing Iran passed, Mahallati seemed to
withdraw the offer, saying Iran would continue to extend the same
degree of cooperation as in the past.
   The resolution Mahallati sought contained no reference to past
Iranian practices that concerned Western nations, such as a reported
``wave of executions'' of political prisoners and repression of the
Bahai religion.
   The Netherlands, Portugal and Belgium were unable to accept such
a resolution, said Mahallati.

   A U.N. committee overwhelmingly denounced
the U.S. refusal to let Yasser Arafat into the country and urged a
reversal of the decision in a harsh resolution sent to the General
Assembly today.
   The 121-2 vote Tuesday evening by the assembly's legal committee
indicated how lopsided the vote in the full assembly is likely to be.
   The United States and Israel opposed the resolution, which
recommended the State Department issue a visa to the Palestine
Liberation Organization leader so he can address the General
Assembly on the Palestinian issue.
   Arafat, in Sudan for talks on the Middle East situation, was
quoted as calling the U.S. decision not to grant him a visa
``illegal.'' The Middle East News Agency quoted Arafat as saying
that if Washington does not let him into the United States, the
General Assembly will convene in Geneva ``in the second half of
December.''

   A sailor on the USS Nimitz was killed
today and another was injured when an aircraft gun accidentally
fired and hit another warplane, causing a fire on the flight deck,
military officials said.
   The fire was controlled in about 20 minutes, but six aircraft
parked on the deck were damaged, the officials said. The 90,944-ton,
nuclear-powererd aircraft carrier continued its mission in the North
Arabian Sea.
   The incident occurred about 2:50 a.m. while crews were performing
``trouble-shooting maintenance'' on the parked aircraft, according
to spokesmen in the Persian Gulf region and at U.S. Central Command
headquarters in Tampa, Fla.
   The identities of the casualties were withheld pending
notification of family members. The injured sailor was taken to a
U.S.military hospital in Wiesbaden, West Germany.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he would accept
tighter restrictions of his power and try to give the nation's
republics more say in their affairs to appease critics of his hotly
contested constitutional reforms.
   Gorbachev received unusually strong criticism Tuesday from the
normally docile Supreme Soviet, which was scheduled to resume debate
today on the reforms. The president proposed the constitutional
changes last month, and the Supreme Soviet, the nation's parliament,
is to vote on them Thursday.
   ``It is obvious that some of the provisions of the bills were not
formulated precisely enough and caused quite a few critical remarks
in the course of discussions,'' Gorbachev told the 1,500 Supreme
Soviet members Tuesday.
   The Supreme Soviet is considering during its three-day session a
package of almost 120 articles of legislation that Gorbachev says
are the first major step toward a political system based on law, not
central dictate.

   A devastating chemical explosion that
killed six firefighters at a highway construction site and shattered
windows 10 miles away was caused by arson, police said.
   Detectives questioned four people to ``evaluate their alibis'' in
Tuersday's pre-dawn fire that triggered the blast, but no arrests
have been made, said Sgt. Gregory Mills, a police spokesman.
   Fire bells tolled throughout the city for the six firefighters,
who were killed when a construction trailer loaded with 30,000
pounds of ammonium nitrate exploded, ripping a large crater in the
ground and virtually obliterating a fire truck.
   Another explosion occurred 40 minutes later in a nearby trailer
that stored 15,000 pounds of the material, which is used in highway
construction projects to make dynamite explode more evenly.

   Concern about the reliability of the safety
alarms on commercial jetliners is responsible for the government's
suggestion for a new device in 3,700 aircraft: an alarm to warn
pilots their alarm isn't working.
   The Federal Aviation Administration announced Tuesday that it
plans to require airlines early next year to install a warning light
in all of their jetliners to tell pilots if their takeoff alarm
system is out of commission.
   The takeoff alarms, variations of which are found in all
commercial jetliners, are supposed to guard against a plane taking
off without being properly prepared, such as having its wing flaps
in the wrong position.
   The alarm, which in some planes sounds a loud horn and in others
a computerized voice, often is the last defense against a pilot's
oversight, aviation experts say.

   Government and private analysts said today the
outlook for world wheat markets looks strong next year and offers
U.S. producers a good opportunity to make gains.
   More land worldwide is expected to be devoted to wheat production
in 1989 because of strong crop prices and government incentives,
including easing of land-idling restrictions for farmers in the
United States, said Bruce R. Weber, an economist with the
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   In prepared remarks for delivery at today's session of the USDA
Agricultural Outlook Conference, Weber forecast that total harvested
areas for wheat could rise 5 percent to 6 percent above 1988 levels
to 230 million to 232 million hectares worldwide. A hectare is a
metric measure equalling nearly 2{ acres.
   ``If the recent upward trend in yields continue, the world should
easily harvest a 1989 wheat crop in excess of 500 million (metric)
tons,'' said Weber. ``How favorable the growing season is will
dictate how close the crop comes to the record 530 million harvest
of 1986.''

   David Allen Lindsey Sr. had a talent
for building objects and images.
   As a carpenter, he built furniture and made free repairs around a
Miami orphanage for years. As a rare single man allowed to adopt
children, he put together a family of 11 boys. As an apparently
devoted father, he developed the trust of child-welfare officials
and of journalists who hailed him as a man breaking stereotypes.
   Now, the same boys who filled his three-bedroom Boynton Beach
home could tear down what's left of the world Lindsey built.
   Two of his adoptive sons have agreed to testify in the sexual
abuse trial of the man they once called ``Dad.'' The two are
Lindsey's 19-year-old namesake, David Jr., who is learning to live
on his own now, and a 9-year-old adjusting to a new foster family.
   Lindsey, free on bond and living with his wife of eight months in
the northern Florida city of Ocala, faces nine counts of sexual
assault against the two and an unidentified neighborhood boy.
Conviction could bring life imprisonment.
   Five other adopted sons recanted statements they made against
Lindsey last year to Boynton Beach police.
   Lindsey's trial is to begin soon in circuit court in West Palm
Beach, though no date has been set. Meanwhile, the two adoptive
brothers have filed civil suits against the 42-year-old man and
agencies involved in the adoptions, seeking unspecified monetary
awards.
   ``He is an animal,'' said Sgt. David Nissensohn of the Boynton
Beach Police Department, which led the initial probe of Lindsey last
year. ``He has destroyed the lives of many boys and belongs behind
bars.''
   ``He's ugly,'' said the third-grader who agreed last month to
testify. ``If I go to court I won't look at him. I'll just turn my
head and tell them what happened.''
   Not long ago, people spoke quite differently about Lindsey,
calling him a self-sacrificing savior who opened his home to the
most troubled, needy boys, many of them youths who had gone from one
foster home to another after neglect or abuse by their parents.
   A sign in his home read: ``It's better to build children than to
repair men.''
   The boys Lindsey adopted were all under 14 years old, most
between 7 and 12, when adopted. All are now either on their own or
placed with foster families.
   In 1969, Lindsey's request to adopt a son was met with
astonishment. Single-parent homes were less common then, and an
unmarried man seeking to adopt was a particular curiosity.
   Lindsey, however, was relentless. He argued that a single man
could be a fine parent and provide a loving home. After two years of
volunteering time at the state-funded Children's Home Society
orphanage in Miami, he was given his first son, Ray.
   By 1981, Lindsey's family had grown to five boys, the fifth being
David Jr.
   On Father's Day, they were a staple for the local and national
news media, and the stories were always upbeat. Lindsey seemed to
have tireless energy and commitment. ``I get more out of the boys
than out of freedom,'' he said in a 1981 article.
   The boys never had a complaint for outsiders.
   ``Looking back now it's hard to see how someone didn't question
the arrangement,'' said Becky Walker, supervisor of children's
services for the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services, referring to Lindsey's request only for white,
pre-adolescent boys to adopt. ``I can't say what they were thinking
then.''
   Evelyn Cassidy, the counselor who arranged most of Lindsey's
adoptions at the Children's Home, has temporarily been assigned to a
new job at the agency until the trial is completed. She declined to
comment on Lindsey or the charges.
   The storm of allegations against Lindsey began to brew during a
series of quarrels with David Jr. in early 1987. The boy eventually
left the house and, after two days away, was about to call Lindsey
for forgiveness.
   Instead, he telephoned the Rev. Neil Hickem and his wife at the
First Baptist Church in Delray Beach, where Lindsey used to take his
sons nearly every Sunday.
   On a night in May 1987, David Jr. told the couple his adoptive
father masturbated and performed oral sex on the boys, whom he
claimed often slept with Lindsey. The abuse usually ended when the
boys reached late puberty, he said.
   ``I don't think I know how to love,'' David Jr. has told the
Miami Herald.
   ``Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like if this had never
happened, if I had been adopted by a different family,'' he said.
``I wonder if I would have gone to college. I wonder if I would have
gotten married and had children. It's hard for me to imagine now
what will happen.''
   The day after he talked with the Hickems, David Jr. again told
his story to Boynton Beach detectives and the tale was corroborated
by five other adoptive brothers, police said. But eventually all but
David Jr. would recant their tape-recorded stories.
   Three months before, a boy from nearby Lake Worth had identified
Lindsey as the man who had offered him money for sex, said police.
The boy, however, did not wish to press charges.
   Police later found a neighborhood boy who claimed Lindsey had
twice assaulted him and gave him a motorcycle to remain silent.
   Lindsey was arrested on June 3, 1987. Last March, Circuit Judge
Thomas Sholts rejected a plea agreement that would have given
Lindsey psychiatric counseling _ but no jail time _ in exchange for
a confession.
   Lindsey's attorney, Richard Lubin, said at the time his client
wanted to spare the boys the trauma of testifying.
   Prosecutors now have an extensive witness list that includes
former neighbors and associates of Lindsey, said Mary Greene, a
spokeswoman for the crimes against children division of the state
attorney general's office.
   ``We do not expect a plea,'' she said. ``We intend to prosecute.''

   When Beth Howland and Jennifer Warren heard
about Jason Gaes' book telling of his battle against cancer they
knew they had found the subject for their first co-production.
   Howland, an actress best-known for her role as Vera on the TV
series ``Alice,'' saw Jason and his mother on a public-access
television show talking about his upcoming book, ``My Book for Kids
with Cansur.''
   ``I was so taken with him,'' said Howland. ``He was so
articulate. He was a regular kid, but wise beyond his years without
being precocious.''
   Jason was 8 when he was stricken with Burkitt's lymphoma, a form
of viral cancer. The producers said Jason, now 10, is considered
cured.
   Their story of Jason and the fight he and his family waged
against cancer is told in ``You Don't Have To Die,'' a half-hour
documentary that will have its premiere Monday on Home Box Office.
   The show combines documentary footage with animation of the
book's illustrations, drawn by Jason's twin brother, Tim, and an
older brother, Adam.
   ``The documentary was secondary with us,'' said Howland. ``What
we really wanted to do was animate the book. The drawings in the
book are very primitive, like little stick drawings.''
   Warren added, ``The animation was done by John Canemaker and it
weaves in and out of the documentary. The animation deals with his
treatment and things that would be hard to take in real life. The
animation is informative but not frightening. It includes some
fantasies, too, because Jason talks a lot about death.''
   The reason Jason wrote the book, and the reason it appealed to
Howland and Warren, was that it was about survival and hope.
   ``There are so many books and pictures about people who die,''
said Howland. ``Jason wanted a book about hope. The survival rate
for children's cancer is now very good.''
   ``My Book for Kids with Cansur'' began as an invitation to a
get-well party for Jason, who lives in Worthington, Minn. The
American Cancer Society in Minnesota saw it and printed it as a
pamphlet.
   ``We first saw it as a pamphlet,'' said Warren. ``The book has
more drawings and is in color. It has a real charm to it.''
   ``It has very little text,'' said Howland. ``That's why we did
the documentary. There wasn't enough material for a half hour of
animation. It was a good thing, because once we got into it we found
out how expensive animation is.''
   The show was filmed at Jason's home and at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., where Jason was treated.
   ``It's about this family and how they went through this
experience and what happened to each of them,'' said Howland. ``The
family stuck together, which we learned isn't usually the case when
a child has a catastrophic illness.''
   The documentary is the first for their Tiger Rose Productions,
which they named for their dogs. Warren and Howland first met as
acting students in New York.
   Warren has starred in a number of motion pictures, including
``Night Moves'' and ``Slap Shot,'' and the TV series ``Paper Dolls.''
   They are developing other projects, including dramas that they
would star in.
   Howland is currently in rehearsal for Alan Ayckbourn's ``A Chorus
of Disapproval'' at the Arena Theater in Washington, D.C.
   Warren will direct ``The Beans of Egypt, Maine,'' for PBS'
``American Playhouse'' and for later release as a feature film. It's
adapted from Carolyn Chute's novel about a rowdy rural family.
   ``I have no interest in directing,'' said Howland. ``I produce
because there aren't enough acting jobs. You have to create them.''

<HEAD>Money Funds' Widening Edge On Bank Accounts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the prime products of banking
deregulation, the money market deposit account, observes its sixth
anniversary this month.
   But many savers and investors might feel they have less reason to
cheer the occasion than the banks and savings institutions that take
these deposits.
   As short-term interest rates have climbed steadily this year,
yields on most types of money market investments have moved up on a
parallel course.
   In contrast, returns on the typical money market deposit account,
or MMDA, simply haven't kept pace.
   As of late November the average rate on MMDAs at 100 large banks
and thrift institutions stood at 5.93 percent, according to Bank
Rate Monitor.
   Compare that to a 10 percent to 10.5 percent prime lending rate,
the basic rate used by the institutions to calculate the interest
they charge on many adjustable-rate loans to both businesses and
consumers.
   Or, even more pertinent, contrast it to the average yield on
money market mutual funds of just under 8 percent, as reported by
Donoghue's Money Fund Report of Holliston, Mass. That translates
into $4 in interest for every $3 paid to MMDA depositors.
   MMDAs were created in December 1982 as a way of allowing banks
and savings institutions to compete with the money funds, which had
been enjoying explosive growth.
   And compete they did. For most of the next four years, MMDAs
offered returns close to _ even occasionally exceeding _ what you
could get in a money fund.
   What's more, MMDAs offered the advantage of federal deposit
insurance. Money funds, no matter how safe they may be deemed, have
no such direct backing from the federal government. Cash poured into
MMDAs.
   Since early 1987, another key difference between the two vehicles
has begun to manifest itself.
   Money funds are required to pay out to their shareholders
whatever they can earn from money-market securities such as Treasury
bills and commercial paper issued by corporations, minus their
expenses and management fees.
   Bank and thrift institutions, on the other hand, are free to pay
whatever rate on MMDAs they think the market will bear.
   Since interest rates began moving higher in the spring of last
year, money fund yields have responded automatically with increases
of their own. MMDA yields barely budged.
   The disparity in available returns has not gone unnoticed. Assets
in money funds have lately climbed to new highs, surpassing $280
billion.
   That total still pales, however, in comparison to the $500
billion-plus that reposes in MMDAs.
   ``This indicates that banks and thrifts have found a level of
interest rates satisfactory to most depositors that is significantly
below the rates prevailing in the open market,'' said Norman Fosback
in the advisory letter Income & Safety.
   ``By permitting their yields to lag far behind money funds, banks
and thrifts have lowered their interest costs _ and boosted their
earnings _ by approximately $7.5 billion a year.
   ``That same $7.5 billion represents earnings lost by savers that
have chosen to ignore the growing superiority of money funds over
deposit accounts.
   ``Of course, all insured money market accounts are not equal,''
Fosback added. In spots across the country, some institutions are
offering MMDAs with rates in the neighborhood of 8 percent.
   ``Nevertheless,'' Fosback concluded, ``the average money fund
holder is doing much better today than the average money market
account depositor at a bank or thrift.''

<TEXT>
   In socialist and capitalist societies alike, the
motive is the same _ to increase economic values by a greater
reliance on private initiative. It is a worldwide trend.
   Their economies bogged down by bureaucratic obstacle courses,
socialist nations are allowing _ and relying on _ a much greater
degree of private sector initiative in the form of profit-seeking
businesses.
   And for reasons roughly similar, countries more inclined toward
capitalism than socialism are seeking ways to privatize, or turn
over to the private sector a variety of governmental activities.
   In each instance the goal is to stimulate economies, raise
revenues and clear away bottlenecks through reliance on individual
initiative in the belief that society is best served when goals are
clear and achievement is rewarded.
   Though action is stalled for the time being, the privatization
effort in the United States is building support because of one of
the country's most persistent failures, the inability to live within
the constraints of budgets.
   Government is seen as wasteful, cumbersome and unable to
extricate itself from its problems, especially debt. Wouldn't it be
better, say the advocates of privatization, to let the private
sector handle some of the problems?
   It is hardly an American phenomenon, since Britain, France,
Japan, New Zealand and other nations have done more. Since 1979, for
example, the British government has sold more than $36 billion in
public assets.
   Not only did the British Treasury boast a $17 billion surplus for
1987, but some of the once subsidized state-owned enterprises are
now profitable, tax-paying private enterprises.
   The National Freight Corp., for example, has expanded its
operations, once subsidized by government, and created new jobs. In
addition, employees who bought shares in the company have seen the
value of the shares skyrocket.
   Often ridiculed just a couple of decades ago, U.S. privatization
advocates now can be found in government, academe, industry,
not-for-profit institutions, and even to some extent in the labor
movement.
   While movement has been slow, the agenda is packed. Consider some
of the items: Selling government loans, federal lands, surplus
military bases, the U.S. Postal Service, the airwaves and even the
nation's highways and bridges.
   The air traffic control system is a candidate for privatization.
Education too. So is the Tennessee Valley Authority. Prisons also.
Even Social Security.
   Some privatizing already has occurred in the United States, but
only on a relatively modest scale. Conrail, the rail freight
operation, went for $1.7 billion. More than $5 billion in federal
loans were sold during the Reagan administration. Some low-income
housing was privatized. And contracting out of government services
and production has occurred on a small scale.
   Of greater future consequence, however, is the research that has
been stimulated at the Heritage Foundation, the Reason Foundation,
the Political Economy Research Center, the Pacific Research
Institute and elsewhere.
   The Reason Foundation, headed by Robert W. Poole Jr., often
credited with coining ``privatization'' in his 1980 book, ``Cutting
Back City Hall,'' has just published ``Federal Privatization,'' with
emphasis on the federal deficit.
   Among other things, the foundation's book lists assets that could
be sold for about $310 billion, plus huge savings in the annual
operation of these assets.
   Included are obsolete military bases, TVA, 370 million acres of
land, a multibillion-dollar loan portfolio, Dulles and National
airports serving Washington, D.C., Amtrak, the postal service and
naval petroleum reserves.
   Could the nation's airwaves be sold to private enterprises? Why
not, says the report. And highways and bridges? Again, why not.
Remember, the report advises, the sale of assets doesn't mean a loss
of control over them.
   Contributors to the book, many of whom assisted the President's
Commission on Privatization when it held hearings, have now
presented their views to the National Economic Commission, which is
deliberating on budget matters.
   The commission is well aware that it has two alternatives:
spending cuts and tax increases.
   The Reason Foundation's authors want the commission to know it
has a third way out of the dilemma of a government living beyond its
means. Try going private, they say. You may like it.

<HEAD>Hyundai Excel Is Car of Contrasts</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hyundai Excel is a car of contrasts. Its base price of $5,499
attracts budget-minded consumers, yet sales figures show the average
buyer winds up with an Excel model averaging at least $8,300.
   Auto critics have panned the little South Korean-built Excel
since its debut in February 1986, yet Americans flocked to the
showrooms and made Hyundai the fourth-biggest importer in its first
year.
   Despite the lower profit margins offered to car dealers from
Hyundai compared with other automakers, the company reports about
one out of every three U.S. dealers have applied for a Hyundai
dealership.
   That's not bad for a car whose name many folks can't pronounce
(it rhymes with Sunday and means ``modern'' in Korean).
   Hyundai officials say they merely found a market niche _ the low
end of the small car market that had been nearly abandoned by the
domestics. Even the Japanese have departed the niche over the last
few years as carmakers moved upscale.
   Buyers get more bang for the buck with our car, more value, a
Hyundai spokeswoman said when asked what sets Hyundai apart from
other subcompacts.
   She said sales rose from 168,882 in the introductory year of 1986
to 263,610 in 1987. Sales in the first 10 months of this year
totaled 225,198 vs. 226,191 in the same period in 1987. The
spokeswoman attributed the slight decline to a strike earlier this
year in South Korea that curtailed production. She said the company
has not projected 1989 sales.
   The average Excel buyer is between 25 and 35 with average income
from $25,000 to $35,000 a year, Hyundai said. Fifty-two percent are
females, and 32 percent are college graduates. A majority have some
college education.
   The test car was a front-drive GLS sedan with a base price of
$7,749 plus $1,300 for options, way above the base Excel at $5,499.
   The Excel GLS had a good set of standard features, such as
tachometer, full cloth seats and a driver seat with height and
lumbar adjustment. These items are not part of the base Excel
package, however.
   The GLS also had a spongy suspension and substantial road noise.
Unfortunately, they are part of the base Excel. And both models have
the underpowered, 1.5-liter four-cylinder, carbureted engine that
has been criticized by auto test drivers.
   I had to agree with them. I found that passing other vehicles _
even on the highway _ took some doing because the Excel's
powerplant, capable of 68 horsepower at 5,500 rpm, just labored. I
put the accelerator to the floor and got no immediate response.
   The engine was teamed with a five-speed manual overdrive
transmission. A drive in a three-speed automatic Excel proved no
better performance-wise. I also dropped the left two wheels off the
highway onto the paved shoulder and had a time getting the Excel
back onto the road.
   Handling is imprecise. Still, in the city I appreciated the Excel
in difficult parking maneuvers. It was a breeze to squeeze into
small spaces. The Excel's fit and finish was superb inside and out.
   The interior was well done, though the rear seat would be a
nearly impossible fit for three decent-sized adults. Legroom was OK
in back if the front seats were moved all the way up, but there
wasn't be much legroom in back if the front seats were pushed back
all the way.
   The trunk had a nice flat floor, but the carpet wasn't fastened
down in the middle and tended to bunch up under luggage.
   Consumer Reports said the Excel reports of trouble from owners in
its first year here, 1986, were average.
   Overall, the Excel seemed to have the trade-offs expected of a
small car priced as low as $5,499.
   But with the test GLS priced at more than $9,000, I had to wonder
whether this is really a low-priced car for a special market niche.
At $9,000, a buyer could widen his or her scope to the Honda Civic
DX hatchback at around $8,450 or a Ford Escort, which starts around
$7,000. Then, the niche is gone, and perhaps that's the biggest
contrast of all.

   As the morning mist lifts, groups of
mostly older men and women, faces shielded from the sun by
cone-shaped straw hats, make their way to a large, low-lying field
to cultivate garden plots.
   It's a ritual startlingly reminiscent of scenes shown on
television during the Vietnam war. But this is the Mississippi
Delta, not the Mekong.
   ``I have seen this same thing in Vietnam, many times,'' said Tu
Pineda, an interpreter for Associated Catholic Charities of New
Orleans. She pointed to an elderly man harvesting small white
eggplants, grinned and said, ``Papa-san.''
   The man, Moi Nguyen, 71, spoke to her in Vietnamese. ``He says he
and his wife sold fish sauce and anchovy paste in their village back
in South Vietnam,'' Pineda said. ``He says they emigrated there
(from North Vietnam) in 1954, after the French were defeated, and
then came here in 1975.''
   She slowly surveyed the other gardens, many bordered by banana
plants, and added, ``This is very, very much like Southeast Asia.''
   The similarity to Southeast Asia of this village 12 miles east of
New Orleans is no accident. More than 2,800 of its 4,000 residents,
70 percent, are refugees from South Vietnam. They are part of the
larger Vietnamese community, more than 12,000 strong, that has
settled in greater New Orleans since 1975.
   ``There are larger populations of Vietnamese in this country, in
California, New York and Texas, for example,'' said Monsignor
Dominic Luong. ``But New Orleans certainly has the most unique
refugee group in the country.''
   What makes it so unique is Versailles _ the nation's most
intensely Vietnamese community, a place where cone hats are common
and ``For Sale'' signs are as likely to be in Vietnamese as in
English.
   ``In other areas of the country the Vietnamese refugees are
scattered throughout their communities,'' Luong said. ``Here, they
basically live in two places, in eastern New Orleans and along the
west bank of the Mississippi River, south and west of the city.
   ``But Versailles is even more special because most of the people
living here came from three small fishing villages near Vung Tau,
about 50 miles southeast of Saigon; in a sense, they have recreated
their villages. Also, many of them fled North Vietnam earlier, so
coming here was their second major migration in two decades.''
   He gestured toward the village's commercial section, where more
than two dozen shops and businesses _ emblazoned with Vietnamese
signs or bearing English names such as ``Saigon Plaza'' _ were doing
a brisk trade.
   Luong, who has been in this country 20 years, said, ``See all
those stores, those groceries, those medical clinics, laundries and
restaurants and so forth? Those were all built since the Vietnamese
arrived here in 1975.
   ``Before that,'' he said, a note of pride in his voice, ``there
was nothing there except weeds.''
   He stepped into a Vietnamese grocery that offered a variety of
oriental vegetables as well as canned abalone, dried squid, pickled
duck's feet and a whole, roasted pig. The young Vietnamese clerk
said few Americans ever came into the store.
   Later, driving down a street in a 400-unit rental complex
comprising half of the village proper, Luong pointed to a parking
lot where youths were passing a football. ``That's where I held
outdoor services for the first 18 months after I came out here in
1978.''
   Jane Foley, director of Resettlement and Immigration Services for
Associated Catholic Charities, also remembers those days in 1975.
``The archdiocese sponsored 1,000 refugees that first summer, right
after Saigon fell. We found apartments for a lot of them out at
Versailles because it was a big subdivision that was failing and
plenty of housing was available.''
   By 1978, more than 5,000 refugees had poured into the New Orleans
area, many sponsored by the archdiocese. Hundreds more arrived over
the next five years, as thousands of ``boat people'' fled Vietnam.
Tu Pineda, who fled with her son, a niece and two nephews, was among
them.
   Other refugees, like Minh Nguyen, a former helicopter pilot who
runs an auto repair shop in Jefferson Parish, came to New Orleans
from elsewhere in the country. ``I was living in Kentucky and we had
a big, big snow that first winter. As soon as spring arrived I came
to New Orleans; it is more like Vietnam here,'' he said.
   Most of the refugees who came to New Orleans owned nothing but
their clothes when they arrived. Only 5 percent spoke English.
   ``But they worked hard, often holding two or three jobs, and
everybody helped each other,'' Luong said. ``Now, 40 percent of
Versailles' Vietnamese residents own their own homes. And we're not
talking about professionals here; most of the Vietnamese
professionals live in the Washington, D.C., area, not in New
Orleans.''
   It hasn't been easy. In the early years, no public transportation
ran between New Orleans and Versailles, and language and cultural
differences created constant tension with the refugees' American
neighbors.
   The simmering cultural problems boiled over in 1978, when the
area economy was slipping. Death threats were mailed to several
Vietnamese families amid rumors that missing pets were ending up in
Vietnamese stewpots. And angry neighbors complained more than once
when refugee families hung pungent fish from apartment balconies to
dry in the sun.
   ``A lot of those things have been smoothed out,'' Luong said.
``However, I do still spend a lot of time handling misunderstandings
with our black neighbors. Many of them are jealous of us, I think,
because they feel our people are taking their jobs.''
   The Vietnamese initially took the lowest-paying menial jobs, jobs
nobody else wanted. They have slowly climbed the economic ladder,
opening small stores and shops and moving into better-paying service
jobs in restaurants and tourist attractions like the Cafe du Monde
in the French Quarter. Fishing, however, is the refugees' major
occupation.
   ``Nearly half of Versailles' workers leave home on Monday morning
and stay out on the boats until the following weekend,'' Luong said.
``A couple of Vietnamese refugees even run shrimp processing plants
now.''

   One such plant operator is Nguyen Cao Ky, who was premier of
South Vietnam for three years beginning in 1965. He operates a boat
dock and processing plant at Dulac, a small Cajun community 70 miles
southwest of New Orleans.
   ``More than 60 percent of the shrimpers from Texas to Florida now
are Vietnamese fishermen,'' said Ky.
   Ky, 59, who first visited southern Louisiana two years ago after
his California liquor store went bankrupt, moved to Dulac in June.
He said he has been well-received, despite recurring stories of
friction between Vietnamese fishermen and American shrimpers along
the Gulf coast.
   ``Vietnamese fishermen have been here for 13 years now. There was
trouble at first but not so much anymore, I think,'' Ky said.
   Sonny Parfait, Dulac's constable, said he doesn't hear nearly as
much grumbling about the Vietnamese but noted that tensions have
risen in some areas because shrimp catches have been below normal
for two fishing seasons.
   ``Then there's the Louisiana economy,'' said Eleanor Will,
director of Associated Catholic Charities' Office of Refugee Social
Services. ``The job situation here is so poor. There are so few jobs
that some refugees are being forced to leave for other areas, such
as California, which has a looser welfare policy.''
   Will said the most persistent problem for the refugee community
has been culture shock, especially for grandparents and older
married males.
   ``Some married men are very threatened by their wives' new-found
independence,'' she explained. ``And the grandparents tend to be
depressed because they came from a culture where older people were
honored and made all the important family decisions; here, things
are different.''
   Squatting beside her garden near Versailles, 62-year-old Vi
Nguyen, who left two daughters in Vietnam, said the garden helps her
forget her troubles.
   ``I'm not so sad anymore,'' said the gray-haired woman, whose
youngest daughter soon will graduate from Louisiana State University.
   Like many of the refugee gardeners, she sells her vegetables _
including yellow ginger, lemon grass and ginseng _ to the local
Vietnamese markets.
   ``They use the money to help their children with school
expenses,'' said Luong. ``About half of our high school graduates,
those who don't have to help their families on the shrimp boats, go
on to college.''
   But this sort of success points out another cultural problem, he
said. ``The children are forgetting how to speak Vietnamese. Their
parents are so upset, that we have begun language classes at the
church. And you know, some of the children say they think the
Vietnamese language sounds funny and foreign.''

   When Nguyen Cao Ky moved to this remote Cajun

Caillou.
   In fact, many of the 3,500 residents didn't realize the newcomer
was a former general and onetime ruler of South Vietnam.
   ``We have a lot of Vietnamese in this area and we saw this fellow
as just another Vietnamese fisherman,'' said volunteer fireman Sonny
Parfait. ``Tell you the truth, I myself didn't know who he was,
until you say so.''
   Parfait, who is also Dulac's constable, said Ky _ South Vietnam's
premier from 1965 to 1968 _ can be seen around town almost any day
as he goes about the business of running the shrimp processing plant
he leased in May.
   ``Everybody seems to like him all right,'' Parfait said. ``At
least I haven't heard any complaints, and his plant is providing
jobs for local people.''
   One of those people, Jean Fairchild of nearby Houma, acknowledged
she had some reservations about staying on as a secretary when Ky
took over the then-failing processing plant.
   ``I decided to give him a chance. I had no idea what to expect,
working for a Vietnamese, but it has turned out very well; he's a
good boss, and I'm not just saying that, either.''
   Next door in his paneled office, the slender, dark-haired
president of Southern Gulf Seafood Processors Inc. quietly
acknowledged that he has worked hard to fit in here. Dulac is
located 70 miles southwest of New Orleans, deep in the heart of
Cajun country where alligators prowl dark bayou waters and strangers
are often regarded with suspicion by the locals, who speak a
distinctive Cajun patois.
   Ky doesn't dwell on the days when, he says, he had ``absolute
power'' as premier. ``I was a soldier and a politician. Now I am a
businessman and a fisherman. When I'm with Vietnamese fishermen now,
I think they see me now as a fisherman, instead of as a fighter
pilot who used to be their premier.''
   Ky, who looks much younger than his 59 years, usually wears
jeans, sneakers and a sports shirt and limits his socializing
outside the Vietnamese community to an occasional game of tennis.
   More importantly, he hires local workers.
   ``Seven of our eight full-time employees are local Americans. And
our part-time packing crew is largely made up of local residents,''
he said.
   ``It's only fair. Employment opportunities are very scarce in
this area and it wouldn't have been right not to have given the
local people the first chance at these jobs.''
   Ky buys most of his shrimp from the Vietnamese fishermen who ply
the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to Texas. It was they who brought Ky
to Louisiana two years ago, after his Southern California liquor
store went bankrupt.
   ``I was traveling around the country, visiting Vietnamese
refugees,'' he said. ``I came down here and got interested in the
fishing industry. I found I liked it and decided maybe I could make
a living and also help my people.''
   Ky said he thinks the Vietnamese, now thought to comprise more
than 60 percent of the shrimpers in the Gulf, should form a co-op
with the other fishermen. A co-op, he said, would market their
catches and help with their business affairs.
   ``Things are getting more and more complicated for the Vietnamese
fishermen,'' said Ky. ``At first, when they just had small boats,
they could keep everything they made from their catch. Now, however,
many of them own large boats costing several hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
   ``They're getting more and more like Americans,'' he added,
smiling. ``They've got to make $4,000-a-month loan payments to the
bank, they've got insurance premiums to pay.''

   At 85, Lord Home of the Hirsel is a
powerful reminder of how the British Conservative Party has changed
from the party of aristocratic blue-bloods to the virtual fiefdom of
Margaret Thatcher, the grocer's daughter.
   It's a transformation he appears not to regret at all.
   Indeed it was he, as Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who
revamped the party's structure and opened the doors of power to the
middle classes _ first to Edward Heath, the son of a carpenter who
built a small construction business, and then Mrs. Thatcher.
   Lord Home's career on the world stage goes back to 1938, when he
was Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's private secretary at the
Munich Pact talks with Adolf Hitler.
   Home was prime minister for only a year, beginning in October
1963, and is better known internationally through a total of 13
years as foreign secretary or Commonwealth secretary, shepherding
many of Britain's colonies to independence.
   He is not among those high-born Tory grandees who accuse Mrs.
Thatcher of making the governing party rougher, tougher and
uncompromisingly right-wing, sacrificing compassion to free-market
economics.
   ``On the contrary, I think she's a very kind-hearted person,'' he
said in an interview. ``But you have to be decisive these days and
there are two things which she realized and put into practice:
first, that inflation is the real public enemy and, second, that
productivity is the answer.''
   Home divides his time between two vast family estates in
Scotland, which he shares with Elizabeth, his wife of 52 years, and
London, where he keeps politically active through regular attendance
at the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament.
   To become prime minister he had to sit in the House of Commons
and thus renounce a string of hereditary titles, including Baron of
Dunglass, which dates to the 14th century, and Earl of Home, a title
granted to a feudal chieftain ancestor by King James I in 1603.
   ``I didn't seem to matter much what I was called,'' he says. But
he adds that he gave up the titles only after ensuring that his only
son, David, the youngest of his four children, can inherit them.
   Seated beneath portraits of ancestors in the dining room at
Castlemains, a 50-room grouse-shooting lodge and the smaller of his
estates, Home combines wealth, privilege and a long pedigree with a
self-effacing, impeccably courteous manner.
   He remains alert and eloquent. The pale blue eyes, set deep in a
gaunt, thin-lipped face, twinkle with humor.
   When the Conservatives chose the 14th Earl of Home as party
leader and thus prime minister, it meant Home was the first peer
picked to head any government this century.
   ``An elegant anachronism,'' stormed Harold Wilson, then leader of
the opposition socialist Labor Party. ``After half a century of
democratic advance, of social revolution, the whole process has
ground to a halt with a 14th earl.''
   Retorted Home, ``I suppose Mr. Wilson, when you come to think of
it, is the fourteenth Mr. Wilson.''
   He was a compromise choice for the premiership, replacing Harold
Macmillan, who had retired, and Home was the last Conservative
candidate to be picked through a time-honored process of secretive
consultation among the party elders.
   Home changed the system to a ballot among Conservative lawmakers,
opening the way to successors who had scrambled up the ladder from
lower-middle class backgrounds: Heath, and then, in 1975, Mrs.
Thatcher.
   After the traditional upper-class education at Eton and Oxford,
Home was elected to Parliament in 1931, representing the Scottish
district of Larnark.
   Apart from a five-year absence after a 1945 election defeat, he
remained in the Commons until he inherited his father's title and
went to the Lords in 1951.
   To get him back into the Commons as prime minister, the Tory
candidate in the safe Conservative Scottish district of Kinross and
West Perthshire stood aside, and Home won handily on Nov. 7, 1963.
   Home lost a general election in 1964 to Wilson, but again held
high office in 1970-74 as foreign secretary when the Tories regained
power under Heath.
   He retired from the Commons in 1974, and returned to the Lords as
a life peer with the title Lord Home of the Hirsel, the main family
estate.
   Of Britain's three other living former prime ministers, Laborites
Wilson and James Callaghan have faded from public view, while Heath
has become an embittered, resentful, rank-and-file legislator,
sniping ineffectually at Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``He mucked it up,'' Home mused recently of Heath. ``You must not
allow yourself to have a vendetta, particularly with a woman.''
   Home retains an air of being above it all, detached from the
mudslinging and jockeying for power. His aloof, patrician view of
life comes of belonging to a family secure in its ancient
privileges, to whom a defeat in politics is but a minor irritant.
   His brother, playwright William Douglas-Home, remembers the
butler informing the family that Home had lost his Parliament seat
in the 1945 election.
   ``He's lost, my lord,'' said the butler.
   ``Who's lost what?'' replied Home's father.
   One of Home's regrets is that Chamberlain was so wrong in
thinking Britain could avoid war with Nazi Germany, although he
stresses the positive aspect _ that the compromises made by
Chamberlain bought Britain time to arm.
   His only other regret, Home says, is that he neglected to develop
a media image.
   ``I think I should have trained myself in television. But then,
you see, I never thought I'd be prime minister. ... I was quite
happy as I was.''

<HEAD>ITT Subsidiary Sues Campeau Over Bond Losses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A unit of ITT Corp. has sued Campeau Corp. for
damages to its bondholdings stemming from Campeau's takeover
activity, the second time this month ITT has taken such action.
   The unit, Hartford Fire Insurance Co., filed suit Tuesday in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan against Campeau and Federated Department
Stores, which Campeau acquired for $6.6 billion in April.
   The suit accuses Federated of securities fraud involving a $200
million bond issue in October 1987. Federated officials knew their
company was a possible takeover target, and failed to disclose that
they could approve transactions such as a buyout that would reduce
the credit rating _ and thus the market value _ of those bonds, the
suit alleged.
   Campeau borrowed heavily to acquire Federated, causing
bond-rating agencies to downgrade the bonds issued earlier by
Federated.
   Hartford Fire sold Federated bonds after the downgrading,
suffering a $4.3 million loss, the suit stated. The company is
seeking compensatory damages plus interest.
   In takeovers financed mainly with debt _ transactions known as
leveraged buyouts _ the target company is left with a huge debt load
that is repaid with its cash flow or with money raised by the sale
of its assets.
   Because the huge new debt payments increase the risk that the
company will not be able to meet all its previous obligations, such
buyouts generally reduce the credit rating for the target's bonds.
   A Campeau spokeswoman told the New York Times in today's editions
that the Toronto-based company had no comment because it had not
seen the suit.
   ITT's insurance subsidiaries on Nov. 14 sued RJR Nabisco Corp. in
federal court, alleging fraud because Nabisco management did not
disclose the possibility of undertaking a leveraged buyout when it
sold them bonds earlier this year.
   The suit contends that possibility should have been stated in the
bond prospectus because it was likely to depress RJR Nabisco's
corporate debt rating and therefore decrease the price of the bonds.
   RJR Nabisco management last month kicked off a
multibillion-dollar bidding war for the company by making a
leveraged buyout proposal. RJR's bonds have dropped sharply in value
since the bidding began.
   Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. also has sued RJR Nabisco,
claiming the value of its RJR bonds had dropped by nearly $40
million.

September, the government says.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday that growth in the gross

   Motorists are not likely to see higher prices at
the gas pump yet as a result of the latest agreement by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, analysts say.
   Analysts said Tuesday that growing gasoline inventories and
plenty of cheap crude oil supplies made higher gasoline prices
unlikely any time soon.
   OPEC signed an agreement Monday to reduce the amount of crude oil
it produces to 18.5 million barrels a day starting in 1989 from its
current level of approximately 22.5 million.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Weaken Amid OPEC Skepticism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oil futures market is showing increased
skepticism to OPEC's new production accord.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled down 11
cents to $14.92 a barrel Tuesday, after trading as high as $15.25.
Other contract months mostly were lower.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Tuesday,
the December contract for wholesale home heating oil lost 0.86 cent
to settle at 47.79 cents a gallon. The December contract for
unleaded gasoline settled at 46.87 cents a gallon, up 0.50 cent from
Monday.
   Analysts said the market was directionless following Monday's
agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
limit crude production to 18.5 million barrels a day, well under the
estimated 22.5 million it now is pumping.
   ``I think confusion is the watchword,'' said Peter Beutel, an
energy analyst for Elders Futures Inc. ``I don't think OPEC answered
a lot of questions the market has.''
   Beutel said many traders are wondering what the cartel members
would do before the accord takes effect Jan. 1, whether some would
flood the market with oil before the date or start cutting
production early. He said traders also are wondering whether all
members would adhere to the voluntary cuts once the agreement is in
place.
   Just after the pact was announced Monday, the United Arab
Emirates said the output level set in the OPEC agreement was not his
official ceiling, although the nation's oil minister later promised
to abide by the quota.
   Runaway oil production has been responsible for worsening a
worldwide surplus that has sharply reduced oil prices.

<TEXT>
   Motorists could be paying 10 cents a gallon more
at the gasoline pump by mid-1989 if OPEC achieves its goal of
reducing production and raising oil prices by about $4 a barrel,
analysts say.
   But experts also say that because gasoline prices have not fallen
in step with crude prices in recent months, they're unlikely to rise
proportionately in the future.
   Increasing gasoline inventories, the onset of winter and the
current surplus of cheap crude oil are some of the factors
offsetting any crude price hike sparked by the OPEC agreement,
analysts said Tuesday.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signed an
agreement this week to limit the amount of crude oil it produces to
18.5 million barrels a day starting in 1989, compared with its
estimated current level of some 22.5 million barrels.
   Since April, crude prices have fallen by more than 20 percent as
the 13-nation cartel's production worsened a world oil glut.
   Assuming the new accord holds up, OPEC hopes to boost prices to
$18 a barrel or higher the current price of around $14 to $15, in
the first half of the year.
   Every $1 change in crude prices amounts to a change of 2 cents to
3 cents in a gallon of gasoline. If OPEC achieves its $18-a-barrel
target then gasoline prices could jump 8 cents to 10 cents a gallon.
   But gasoline prices have not declined along with crude prices.
Other factors such as inventory levels, demand, imports and the
amount of crude oil going into refineries have offset the drop in
crude prices and may water down any future rise in oil prices.
   ``Product prices have been decoupled from crude. ``There's not a
one on one relationship,'' says Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, chief economist
for Ashland Oil Inc.
   ``If (crude) prices firm $2 to $3 then we will see gasoline
prices go up about a nickel. But if it's just a slight, temporary
increase, it's not going to make much difference to the consumer.''
   Tight gasoline supplies stemming mainly from refinery problems
coupled with high demand helped keep retail prices firm at the gas
pump at that same time that crude prices were going down.
   Michael Canes, an economist for the American Petroleum Institute,
estimates gasoline demand in 1988 has risen 2.5 percent over last
year and was unusually strong late in the summer and this fall.
   ``Gasoline demand increased so we were using all our American
refinery capacity and importing large amounts,'' Canes said. ``We
were having to go to high-cost sources that we don't normally tap.''
   The high costs of imports in turn were passed along to consumers.
So while crude prices began falling steeply in April, gasoline
prices began to climb.
   In April, the average price of regular unleaded gasoline was 93.3
cents a gallon, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By
June, it had risen to 95.5 cents and in August reached 98.7 cents a
gallon.
   A buildup in inventories due to increased refinery capacity
helped lower prices to 97.4 cents in September and to 95.6 cents
last month.
   Analysts say tight gasoline supplies are unlikely to occur again
in 1989 even though gasoline demand is projected to grow at
approximately 120,000 barrels per day annually over the next several
years.
   With the onset of winter, demand for gasoline is expected to
decrease because people drive less during cold weather.
   Even if crude prices do rise substantially, the full increase
will not be passed along to the consumer at least until spring.
   ``Usually there is some lag,'' said Canes. ``First the crude
price is passed on in wholesale (gasoline) and then that gets passed
on at the retail level. It would be six to eight weeks before we
would see a full pass-through.''

<TEXT>
   Just a week after the nation's major airlines
raised most of their discount air fares, four big carriers announced
reductions in some of their fares.
   Eastern Airlines and Continental Airlines, both subsidiaries of
Texas Air Corp., said Tuesday they are cutting their fares to
Florida for travel from Jan. 5 through Feb. 15. Delta Air Lines, a
close competitor of Eastern in the market linking the Northeast and
Florida, said it will match the fare reductions.
   Northwest Airlines, the nation's fourth-largest carrier,
announced in St. Paul, Minn., that it is taking 10 percent off its
domestic fares for passengers 62 or older. A companion accompanying
a senior citizen also is entitled to the reduction, regardless of
the companion's age, Northwest said.
   The limited fare cuts follow a move last week by the nation's big
airlines to boost most of their lowest discount fares and eliminate
the cheap fares that can be booked a few days before a flight.
   The changes, which were initiated by Continental and took effect
last Tuesday, revamped the popular advance-purchase ``MaxSaver''
fares used by most vacation travelers. About two-thirds of the
MaxSaver fares were increased, while the rest were reduced.
   The airlines also dropped the so-called ``junk fares'' available
four to seven days before a flight and used mainly by business
travelers.
   In making the changes last week, Miami-based Eastern said it
planned to keep its fares intact in the highly competitive
Northeast-Florida market. Its competitor Delta also put off revising
fares in the Florida market.
   Eastern, the biggest airline in the Florida market with about a
third of the passenger traffic, announced Tuesday it is cutting its
MaxSaver fares from the Northeast to 11 Florida cities by around $40
on a round-trip ticket. The new one-way fares range from $79 to
$119, down from the current $109 to $149.
   Delta is matching Eastern's fare cuts to Florida, Delta
spokeswoman Glenda Hatchett Johnson said from the carrier's Atlanta
headquarters.
   Eastern said tickets must be purchased from Nov. 30 through Dec.
15, for travel to Florida from Jan. 5 through Feb. 15. Fares are
based on a round-trip purchase and are non-refundable. Tickets must
be purchased within 24 hours of making a reservation.
   Eastern also said it is offering a $50 discount on its winter
vacation packages to Florida for travel through Feb. 15.
   ``Ten years of (airline) deregulation has taught us that price
discounting really does work ... We know that discounts can
stimulate business,'' George Brennan, Eastern's vice president of
marketing, told a news conference in New York.
   With the cheaper fares, Eastern is aiming to attract more
passengers to Florida in January, which is not as heavily booked as
February and March, Brennan said.
   Houston-based Continental announced similar reductions for travel
from 17 cities in the Northeast and Midwest to nine Florida
destinations. Tickets must be bought from Nov. 30 through Dec. 16,
for flights beginning on or after Jan. 5 and completed by Feb. 15.
   The non-refundable tickets require a Saturday night stay and
round-trip purchase. Continental said seats are limited at the
special fares, but are ``generously available.''

<HEAD>U.S.-Made Hondas Selling Well In Japan, Company Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Demand in Japan for American-made Hondas
has been so strong that the company says it has increased production
to satisfy orders for the autos, which it began exporting to its
home country earlier this year.
   Honda, the fourth-largest automaker in the United States, will
ship 6,000 two-door Accord Coupes to Japan by the end of this year,
up from its original estimate of 4,000, according to Roger Lambert,
a spokesman for Honda of America Mfg. Inc.
   Lambert said Tuesday that the first shipment, which arrived in
Tokyo last spring, aroused curiosity among Japanese dealers and
customers. There were orders for 2,000 Accord Coupes when the
initial load of 540 cars was shipped.
   ``They asked, will these cars be as good as the cars that come
out of Japan?'' he said. ``When the first cars arrived, they were
put under the microscope...and they were very well-received.''
   ``Reports continued to come back that orders were pouring in and
that any increase in production would be welcome,'' he said.
   Few Honda dealerships in Japan have the Accord Coupe on display,
primarily because they lack showroom space and because of the
one-month delivery time for the car, said Toshiaki Mishiba, a Honda
dealer in Tokyo. Of the six dealerships in Tokyo that belong to
Honda Daiichi Sales, Mishiba's is the only one displaying the car.
   In Japan, the Coupe sells for 2.6 million yen, about $21,300 at
current exchange rates. A comparable car sells for from $11,650 to
$15,300 in the United States, depending on equipment.
   Mishiba, who has sold about 30 of the Coupes since April, said
Japanese buyers are attracted to the left-side steering wheel in the
U.S.-made Honda. Japanese cars have the steering wheel on the right
side.
   ``It gives Japanese an American feeling combined with confidence
in Honda's quality,'' Mishiba said. ``With its leather seats,
aluminum wheels and (American-made) Bose stereo system, it's
relatively cheap, about 300,000 yen ($2,500) less than a comparable
car sold in Japan.''
   Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney
of New York City, said that although the U.S.-made Hondas were
selling well in Japan, the auto must prove it is a well-made car
that retains its value if the company is to reach its export growth
goals.
   ``The Japanese customer may very well be buying this car this
year because it's new, it's different. It has its badge of
distinction,'' Ms. Keller said.
   Honda will export a total of 12,000 cars this year, including
4,500 Accord four-door sedans to Canada and 1,500 of the same car to
Taiwan, Lambert said. The company hopes to export 70,000 U.S.-made
cars by 1991, including 50,000 to Japan, he said.
   In comparison, General Motors Corp. plans to export 80,000
vehicles worldwide by the end of the year, Ford Motor Co. 42,000 and
Chrysler Corp. 55,000.
   Lambert said Honda plans to export about the same number of
Accord Coupes in 1989 as it exports this year. The car is produced
only at the Marysville plant, about 35 miles northwest of Columbus
in central Ohio.
   Honda began manufacturing in the United States in September 1979
with a motorcycle plant in Marysville. The auto plant at Marysville
began production of the Accord four-door sedan in November 1982, and
an engine plant at Anna in western Ohio started production in July
1985.
   The first U.S.-made Accords shipped to Japan arrived there April
8, the same day Honda of America's one millionth car rolled off the
Marysville assembly line.
   Honda, which holds 3.5 percent of the world auto market, expects
to produce 360,000 cars at its Marysville plant this year.
   The Civic four-door sedan was added to production at Marysville
in July 1986, and production of Civic engines began at Anna two
months later.
   Near the Marysville operation, Honda is building a new assembly
plant that is scheduled to begin production of Civic four-door
sedans in Fall 1989.

<HEAD>Prime Rejects Buyout Offer, Discloses `Third Party' Inquiry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc., has rejected a $970 million
buyout offer MAI Basic Four Inc. and said it had received an
unsolicited overture from a third party.
   Prime on Tuesday called the $20-a-share offer from a subsidiary
of MAI, which is controlled by investor Bennett S.
LeBow,``inadequate'' and said in a statement that Prime's recent
acquisitions and consolidation measures would soon boost the
company's performance.
   ``We believe the unsolicited $20 offer by Choice fails to
recognize either the intrinsic value of the company today or the
long-term values achievable by the company for all its
stockholders,'' said David Dunn, Prime Computer's chairman.
   In trading Tuesday, Prime's stock closed up 87{ cents a share at
$16.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Also Tuesday, Prime said in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing that it had ``received an unsolicited preliminary inquiry
from a third party with respect to a possible negotiated business
combination.''
   Prime spokesman Joseph Gavaghan said the company's board did not
want to disclose the source of the inquiry because it might disrupt
potential negotiations. No discussions have yet begun, he said.
   In a prepared statement, LeBow responded: ``It is quite
surprising that the Prime board, chaired by Mr. David J. Dunn, a
self-avowed advocate of shareholders rights and opponent of
management entrenchment devices such as poison pills and golden
parachutes, would choose to stonewall the MBF offer with such
devices.''
   ``We are opposed to their actions and will continue to pursue
vigorously our acquisition of Prime,'' LeBow said.
   John Adams, an analyst for Adams Harkness & Hill in Boston, said
the announcement of the third-party inquiry did not necessarily
herald the arrival of a ``white knight'' bidder to thwart an MAI
takeover.
   MAI Basic, based in Tustin, Calif., owns 4.1 percent of Prime's
48.5 million shares outstanding.
   In its filing with the SEC, Prime said it was not actively
engaged in any substantive discussions or negotiations that could
lead to a transaction such as a merger, sale or purchase of assets
or a change in Prime's current capitalization and dividend policy,
but might do so.
   The third-party inquiry was made sometime between Nov. 15, when
MAI Basic made its tender offer, and Nov. 22, when the Prime board
voted to keep the source of the inquiry secret.
   The board's unanimous decision to reject the MAI bid was made in
a meeting on Monday and was announced Tuesday. In addition to
rejecting the MAI bid, Prime retained a ``poison pill'' shareholder
rights plan designed to make unwelcome takeovers prohibitively
expensive.
   Last week Prime sued MAI Basic, saying its offer was illegal and
flawed.
   Some analysts have speculated that LeBow has attempted the
takeover to induce Prime to buy his company.
   Dunn said the Prime board considered several factors, including
Prime's business and financial condition, its prospects,
recommendations from the company's financial advisers and the recent
value of its stock, before rejecting the offer.
   The Prime directors felt the current market price of Prime common
stock reflects the negative effects of the costs and expenses
associated with the acquisition of Computervision, acquired in
February for $435 million.
   The company expects belt-tightening measures in certain areas to
improve near-term and long-term operating results of the company and
increase values for stockholders.
   Prime is second to International Business Machines Corp. in the
field of computer-aided design and manufacturing systems. It also
makes sophisticated computer work stations for engineers and
database management systems.

   The dollar firmed against most major foreign
currencies in early European trading today. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said the market focused on the pound,
which was strengthened by last week's increase in British interest
rates and by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's pledge
Tuesday to main high interest rates to combat inflation.
   ``Interest rates are so enticing at the moment in the U.K. that
the pound is bound to keep rising,'' said one trader in Milan, Italy.
   The Bank of England raised the base lending rate one percentage
point to 13 percent last week.
   Other traders said the market is waiting for the release of
several key U.S. economic indicators this week. The October index of
leading economic indicators is scheduled to be released on Thursday
followed by November unemployment statistics on Friday.
   Better-than-expected job figures could fuel inflationary trends
in the U.S. economy and cause the Federal Reserve to increase
short-term interest rates, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.30 yen to a closing 121.85. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 121.91 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.7347 West German marks, up from 1.7285; 1.4515
Swiss francs, up from 1.4481; 5.9250 French francs, up from 5.9125;
1.9552 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9530; 1,282.70 Italian lire, up
from 1,281.25; and 1.1885 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1930
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8468, slightly more
expensive for buyers than late Tuesday's $1.8425.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $421.15 a troy ounce,
down from $422.75 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $421.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $421.25, down from $422.25 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 69 cents to close at a bid
$422.62.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.08 a troy ounce,
down slightly from Tuesday's $6.09.

   The dollar inched down against the Japanese yen
today after its decline in New York, and share prices rose sharply
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 121.85 yen, down 0.30 from Tuesday's close
of 122.15 yen. Opening at 121.77 yen, it moved within a narrow range
of 121.70-121.90 yen.
   The U.S. currency's lower opening in Tokyo followed losses in New
York after Tuesday's release of U.S. gross national product figures
for the third quarter of 1988. The GNP growth was 2.6 percent,
compared to the previous quarter's 2.2 percent.
   Some dealers said the GNP increase was smaller than currency
traders had anticipated.
   But a dealer at Mitsubishi Bank said the GNP figure did not
create a strong downward force on the dollar in Tokyo trading, which
he said was moving little before Friday's scheduled release of the
U.S. unemployment rate.
   A dealer with the Chemical Bank said ``participants were sitting
on the sidelines ahead of the U.S. unemployment rate report.''
   Both dealers spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Meanwhile, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Exchange, which gained
334.98 points the previous day, added 260.60 points, or 0.89
percent, to close at 29,578.90, a new high. The index quickly gained
162.55 points shortly after the market opened and continued upward.
On Monday, the Nikkei closed at 29,318.30.
   The Nikkei's previous record high was 29,430.12 on Nov. 22.
   Share prices were higher almost across the board on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange following the rise in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average overnight in New York and the U.S. GNP announcement.
   ``Market players in Tokyo took the GNP figure positively, mainly
because it was more or less within the range that most of them had
expected,'' Toshiyuki Nishiguchi of Daiwa Securities said.
   ``Now the market is waiting for the U.S. jobless rate to
determine how to act,'' he said.
   Other dealers said the GNP figure boosted buying by institutional
investors as well as individuals.
   In a heavy trading with volume traded on the first section
estimated at 1.6 billion shares, steels, financial and paper-related
issues attracted participants.

<HEAD>Salinas Will Walk A Delicate Line Between Hope and Fear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who takes office as
president on Thursday, will be walking a delicate line between
inflation and deep recession, between debt and investment, and
between his people's hopes and their fears.
   The staggering $102 billion foreign debt is the best-known of
Mexico's economic problems, but it is far from the only one.
   Mexico has gone into recession this fall, partly as a result of a
government deficit and partly as a result of efforts to control
inflation, which was over 140 per cent in 1987.
   The recession is a further blow to a people who lost about half
their buying power during six years of austerity under President
Miguel de la Madrid _ an austerity Salinas presided over as budget
director.
   The economy also has bright spots, such as tremendous growth in
non-petroleum exports, and businessmen are facing the future with
more confidence than they did in 1982.
   ``Back then everybody was trembling, afraid of what was going to
happen next,'' said Ramon E. Alatorre, an assistant to the president
for Howard Johnson of Mexico, a restaurant and motel franchiser.
   Among other things, petroleum prices had plunged, Mexico had run
out of money to pay its foreign obligations and President Jose Lopez
Portillo had just nationalized the banks.
   It was Salinas who led the effort to modernize Mexico's economy,
selling state-owned companies, reducing subsidies and increasing
competition, all policies Salinas intends to continue.
   The dark side was squeezed pocketbooks and political unrest, a
boon to the opposition in the July 6 presidential elections.
   Salinas won, but barely, and, says the opposition, unfairly. He
is now under pressure to resume growth, relieve unemployment and
restore the damaged standard of living.
   A study by a private enterprise group estimated Mexico's economy
created only 350,000 jobs last year _ 650,000 fewer than it needs to
to keep up with the number of young people entering the job market
every year.
   The official unemployment figure is 8 percent, but a study by
Salinas' own Institutional Revolutionary Party estimated the real
rate at 14 percent. Other economists put it as high as 20 percent.
   The latest example of the human strain came this week in the
state of Michoacan, where disgruntled political opponents occupied
city halls in 30 towns and cities and said they wanted Salinas out.
   ``We have to provide housing, education, sanitation and other
basic services,'' Salinas said in a recent televised interview.
   There is a growing consensus that Mexico will get international
help. It will pay $14 billion in interest and principle on its
foreign debt this year, money that could have been used for
investment in development and growth.
   Mexico's debt obligations ``should be designed subject to (its)
capacity to pay under conditions of growth,'' said a study released
this month by the Bilateral Commission on the Future of United
States-Mexican Relations.
   Although Salinas is aiming for a growth rate of 5 percent and
hopes to gain $5 to $6 billion a year in fresh credits and debt
relief, he has already said he expects little growth in 1989.
   A ``social compact'' between government, labor and business has
helped control prices and wages, and Salinas' trickiest immediate
assignment may be ending the pact without reigniting inflation,
recently close to zero.
   Mexico also has had capital outflow since the end of April, when
Mexico boasted $16.2 billion in hard-earned foreign exchange.
   That figure was below $10 billion by October, according to
Jonathan Heath, director of the economic forecasting firm Macro
Asesoria, as Mexico began showing a trade deficit and spent money
supporting the peso.
   Heath and other economists said many feel the financial community
owes Mexico, which has done everything it was asked to do in
revamping its economy and imposing austerity.
   One sign of U.S. confidence and support was a recent $3.5 billion
loan offer to give Salinas some breathing room.
   Oil, which used to account for 90 percent of Mexico's income, now
accounts for about a third _ a diversification in products and
customers that has made it less vulnerable to oil price swings and
the strength of the U.S. economy.
   Mexico should be helped by higher oil prices if a recent
agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
stands up.
   Alatorre, the hopeful businessman, says the progress made should
not be forgotten.
   ``They wouldn't have been able to sell Aeromexico if things had
stayed the way they were,'' said Alatorre, referring to last week's
sale of a government-owned airline for $345 million. ``Nobody would
even have bought a ticket.''

<HEAD>Government Charges GE with Defrauding Army of $10 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co., which pleaded guilty to
a Defense Department fraud charge three years ago, plans to fight
new government accusations that it intentionally shortchanged the
Army $10 million.
   In a federal indictment released Tuesday, the government charged
the nation's third-largest defense contractor and two employees with
hiding savings negotiated with subcontractors in a $270 million
contract to make a battlefield computer system.
   GE, which according to the government faces a maximum penalty of
$71.9 million plus restitution, called the charges
``sensationalized.''
   ``GE has, up to now, found the government to be fair as GE has
implemented this self-policing program and cooperated with
governmental authorities,'' the company said in a statement. ``But,
in this ... case, where the government's indictment is both unfair
and unfounded, GE intends to defend itself at trial.''
   The company also said that an internal investigation into the
same matter showed pricing discrepancies totaling $3.69 million,
which the company already has refunded.
   Thomas H. Lee II, first assistant U.S. attorney, responded: ``We
look forward to the opportunity to have a jury judge the merits of
the case.''
   In Washington, the Defense Department said no decisions have been
made as yet on whether to suspend GE from bidding on defense
contracts, worth $5.8 billion to the contractor last year.
   ``The allegations will now have to be reviewed by the Army,''
said William Caldwell, a Pentagon spokesman.
   GE was awarded a $250 million contract in June 1983 to make the
``decentralized automated service support system,'' called the
DAS-3, for the Army.
   The 321-count indictment charges that GE, through its
wholly-owned subsidiary Management and Technical Services Co.
(MATSCO) in suburban King of Prussia, negotiated subcontracting
costs that were lower than it anticipated and hid them from the Army.
   The Army would have been defrauded of $22 million if the scheme
had not been uncovered, the Pentagon said.
   In May 1985, GE pleaded guilty to contract-fraud charges, paying
a $1.04 million fine and rembursing the government $800,000.
   According to the present indictment, the company and the two
employees, James Badolato of Springfield and Gerald A. Leo of King
of Prussia, lied to the Defense Department about the prices the
company was paying for parts and raw materials and double-billed for
some materials.
   The government charges Badolato, 41, formerly the subsidiary's
subcontracts manager, with trying to cover up the scheme by altering
dates of purchase orders and withholding information from government
auditors. Leo, 51, formerly the materials manager for MATSCO, was
also charged with lying to a federal auditor.
   Leo faces a maximum of 55 years in jail and $1.3 million in fines
if he is convicted on one count of racketeering, five counts of mail
fraud and two counts of making false statements and concealing
material facts from a federal agency.
   Badolato faces the same penalties plus $5,000 more in fines if
convicted of one count of racketeering, five counts of mail fraud,
one count of obstructing agency proceedings and one count of making
false statements and concealing material facts from a federal agency.
   GE is charged with five counts of mail fraud and 312 counts of
presenting false claims to the government.
   In its statement, GE said the employees maintained their
innocence. Leo and Badolato, who have since been transferred to
other parts of GE, referred reporters to the company attorneys.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: New Majority Leader Avoids Confrontation Over
Taxes</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   George Mitchell showed the style he brings to
the post of Senate majority leader when he was asked recently how
the Democratic Congress would respond to George Bush's call for a
cut in the capital gains tax.
   ``I doubt it would be enacted,'' he quickly replied, adding that
``to begin the struggle to reduce the deficit by making a proposal
that would increase the deficit seems to me to be the wrong way to
begin.''
   That said, he lost no time offering the Republican
president-elect an easy way to avoid an early confrontation.
   ``It seems to me he could logically say to those who favor that
position, first we've got to get our fiscal house in order,'' said
the Maine senator.
   The message was clear, but it was delivered without rancor. It
was partisan but not excessively so.
   How much that style contributed to Mitchell's surprisingly easy
victory Tuesday in the contest for majority leader was unclear.
Senators jealously guard their motives in such internal matters.
   But when the secret ballot was tallied, Mitchell had 27 votes
compared with 14 each for Sens. J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and
Daniel Inouye of Hawaii.
   One of the things senators do best is to count votes and assess
their meaning, and as soon as the first ballot total was known,
Johnston and Inouye moved to declare Mitchell's election unanimous.
   The Maine senator succeeds Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a man
of far different temperament and style. Out of place in an age of
television, Byrd often came across as a throwback to a time when the
Senate was a club ruled by elders who used their seniority and their
power to dispense or withhold favors as a way of maintaining party
discipline.
   During the past two decades the Senate changed markedly. Most
obviously, the average age plummeted. It now is somewhere just below
50. Gone are the aged Southern monuments to the past. Many senators
are in their thirties and have young children.
   They also grew up with television and recognized its power and
Ronald Reagan's mastery of the medium. Two years ago, after a decade
of resistance, television entered the Senate chamber and the
Democrats became more acutely aware of the need for a leader who
would project well to Americans now able to watch debates from their
living rooms.
   Clearly, television worked in Mitchell's favor as he sought
support from his colleagues.
   One of the highlights of the televised Iran-Contra hearings was
Mitchell's confrontation with Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, the
former White House aide who was a central figure in the sale of arms
to Iran and the diversion of funds to the Nicaraguan contras.
   ``Please remember ... that it is possible for an American to
disagree with you on aid to the Contras, and still love God, and
still love this country, just as much as you do,'' said Mitchell.
   But his ability to come across well on television was not
Mitchell's only asset.
   The Maine senator also displayed a talent for putting his finger
on the right balance of politics and substance.
   ``When you begin to permit political calculations to dominate the
decision-making process, more often than not you end up wrong
substantively and wrong politically,'' Mitchell said during a recent
interview in his office in the Capitol.
   At the same time he's aware of the political implications of this
transition period and he sent a clear message to Bush the moment he
emerged from the Democratic caucus.
   ``The Democrats await with interest and enthusiasm the proposals
of the next administration,'' Mitchell said.
   The new administration and Congress are faced with record budget
and trade deficits. The Republican president-elect campaigned on a
``no new taxes'' pledge, but most Democrats and many Republicans as
well believe new revenues will be required to attain significant
reduction in the deficit.
   Still, no one wants to get out front advocating a tax increase
and let the new president replay his ``read my lips'' line from the
GOP convention.
   So, Mitchell took over his new job and nodded to the
president-elect and said, in effect, ``After you, George.''

   Cities of more than 100,000 population will be
required to obtain federal pollution discharge permits for storm
sewers from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA said today.
   The same requirements will fall on certain large industrial
plants with their own storm sewers, but generally not plants that
discharge into a municipal storm sewer system.
   The requirements come in draft regulations required by 1987
legislation to bring storm sewers under the agency's permit system.
   Several studies have shown that storm runoff and melting snow can
pick up pesticides and fertilizers from lawns, oil from garages and
service stations and other contaminants from construction sites,
landfills, junkyards, construction sites and even dry cleaners.
   Twenty-one states have listed construction-site runoff as a major
source of harm to stream water quality.
   A major feature of the regulations will ban cross-connections
between storm sewer systems and sanitary sewage lines. These
connections, called illicit connections because they are frequently
just that, can result in the discharge of industrial process waste
or household sewage to rivers and streams without proper treatment.
   ``Removal of these illicit connections often presents
opportunities for dramatic improvements in the quality of
storm-sewer discharges,'' EPA said.
   Cities with combined sanitary and storm sewers, generally older
cities in the East, are covered by a separate set of regulations.
   Cities will be allowed to propose their own permit conditions.
EPA said that for the initial five-year permit terms, cities would
have to start identifying pollution sources, conduct an initial
analysis of illicit connections, and describe their storm sewer
management plans and priorities.
   The plans will place heavy emphasis on optimum management
practices, including appropriate local ordinances, instead of
requiring new treatment facilities, EPA said.
   The agency said it would hold several hearings around to country
through February seeking comments on the draft regulations.

<HEAD>Dominican President: Economic Discipline Answer To Latin Debt Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strict economic discipline is the only way to
overcome the mounting public debt facing some Latin American
countries, said President Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic.
   ``The problem of the public debt in Latin America is the product
of a lack of forethought,'' Balaguer said Tuesday night in the first
address at the 12th annual Miami Conference on the Caribbean.
   ``Those governments in power happily contracted those loans and
then without thought failed to manage funds responsibly,'' he said.
   The debt can be surmounted only through strict economic
discipline and adjustments, not through ``gifts or donations'' from
the United States or the International Monetary Fund.
   Debt in Latin America and underdeveloped countries worldwide is
not just an economic or political problem, but a human one, Balaguer
said.
   The greatest challenge ``isn't payment of the debt, but sustained
economic growth and increased per capita income,'' said Balaguer,
speaking in Spanish. ``The first challenge is to live _ the second
is to pay.''
   ``We have to seek the causes of underdevelopment of the Third
World, especially the Latin underdevelopment,'' he said. ``Something
must exist... that would allow some nations to advance while others,
in many cases exceptionally endowed by nature, haven't been able to
reach the level that corresponds to them.''
   About 2,000 delegates, including Latin and Caribbean officials
and investors from outside the region were expected to participate
in the four-day conference on trade, investment and development.
   Preceeding Balaguer with welcoming remarks were Miami Mayor
Xavier Suarez, Prime Minister Maria Liberia Peters of the
Netherlands Antilles and French Minister of State for Foriegn
Affairs Ewige Avice.
   ``We have big expectations towards the Bush administration and
the newly elected Congress,'' said Ms. Peters, adding that the
smaller countries of the Caribbean should find a way to join the
United States and Canada in their free trade agreement.
   In addition to Balaguer, the Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo
and the prime ministers of Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Jamaica, the
Netherlands Antilles, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines
were to attend.

<TEXT>
   A fund for up to 200,000 victims of
asbestos-related disease is beginning to settle claims that are
expected to reach $3 billion against Manville Corp., once the
nation's largest producer of asbestos.
   The company, which emerged from bankruptcy protection Monday, is
setting aside 80 percent of its new stock to help pay the huge
liability bill.
   The company is the former Johns Manville Co., which sought
bankruptcy protection in 1982 with about 17,000 pending
asbestos-related lawsuits dating to the 1960s.
   As part of a court-approved reorganization, the company helped
establish the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust. The
bankruptcy court approved the reorganization in December 1986;
appeals by various parties delayed the effective date of the
reorganization until this week.
   The company already has settled an estimated 10,000 lawsuits for
about $500 million. The trust fund is working to clean up the
remaining 7,000 that were outstanding at the time of the bankruptcy
filing. It will then take on thousands of claims filed since then.
   A second trust, called the Property Damage Settlement Trust,
would settle asbestos-related property claims. Manville paid $100
million cash into it and the company's insurance carriers also will
contribute millions of dollars.
   Asbestos, once regarded as a miracle fiber, was used in scores of
products because of its fire retardant qualities before scientists
discovered it caused such diseases as asbestosis, lung cancer and
mesothelioma.
   Manville was the biggest producer, but other asbestos makers and
distributors also have been sued, and many of those firms also
sought bankruptcy protection of their assets.
   The Manville trust for personal injury claims is designed to last
for 27 years.
   ``We are in business to compensate all Manville asbestos health
claimants, including current, known and future victims,'' said
Marianna Smith, executive director of the trust.
   ``Asbestos-induced diseases may take up to 30 years to manifest
symptoms, resulting in serious and sometimes fatal results,'' she
said. ``Although the exact number of claims the trust may receive is
unknown, estimates range as high as 200,000.''
   Most of the personal injury claimants have been workers in the
asbestos industry and in industries such as shipbuilding, where the
substance was widely used.
   About 3,000 victims live in the Philadelphia area, Ms. Smith
said, which has been a center of asbestos litigation because of the
concentration of shipbuilding and petrochemical industries.
   Other regions with the same types of businesses are San
Francisco, Los Angeles and parts of Texas and Mississippi.
   Gene Locks, an attorney who represents more than 5,000 claimants,
said most settlements will average around $35,000. Some payouts
could be more than $100,000, Ms. Smith said. The payouts should
start in December, probably first to victims in the New Orleans area
where Manville had a plant.
   Locks said he believes ``in excess of $3 billion will be
available'' to pay victims during the next two to three decades.
   The trust is the result of four years of negotiation by lawyers
for claimants, Manville and the federal bankruptcy court in the
Southern District of New York, which permitted Manville to emerge
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

<HEAD>Another Court Order Issued In Takeover Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has issued an order forbidding
Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken & Biscuits to buy stock in Church's
Fried Chicken Inc. for 10 working days.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz on Tuesday issued the
preliminary injunction until after certain disclosures are made.
   Also Tuesday, Church's authorized its board to begin talks with
other potential buyers.
   The court order was another legal skirmish in an attempted buyout
of San Antonio-based Church's by A. Copeland Enterprises Inc., which
owns New Orleans-based Popeyes, which first made the offer on Oct.
25.
   Schwartz also ordered Popeyes:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _To reveal the information on which its buyout offer was made.
Church's claims its former chief financial officer took confidential
files with him when he left to work for Popeyes owner Al Copeland.
   _To disclose the amount of money spent by Popeyes to buy and
maintain an offshore racing boat, corporate jet, helicopter, yacht,
bus and luxury car used by Copeland.
   _To stop using, at least for the time being, any confidential
Church's information it might have.
   A Church's spokesman said the company would ask the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals to permanently enjoin Popeyes from pursuing
the takeover and to block the buyout on antitrust grounds.
   Peter Butler, Popeyes' New Orleans lawyer, said Schwartz would
have all the information this week. He said he could not comment on
McAtee's claim that Popeyes' offer was based on ``insider
information.''
   As for corporate expenditures for boats, planes and other
conveyances, Butler said: ``All those expenses have been treated as
legitimate business expenses by the business firm retained by Mr.
Copeland and been reviewed very carefully.''

<HEAD>US, EEC To Discuss Hormone Dispute Again In Montreal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In another attempt to stave off a
trans-Atlantic trade war, U.S. and EEC officials plan to meet in
Montreal to discuss an EEC plan to ban imports of U.S. meat treated
with growth-boosting hormones.
   EEC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said Wednesday he
and EEC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen will discuss the
ban with U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng on Friday.
   ``We should try everything possible and decent to avoid the
clash,'' De Clercq told reporters.
   Friday's encounter will precede next week's meeting in Montreal
to review progress in the Uruguay round of global trade
liberalization talks within the 96-nation General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   The 12-nation European Economic Community has complained to GATT
about the growth hormones, which it considers a health hazard, and
about U.S. threats of retaliation.
   The meat import ban is scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1. The
ban would affect about $145 million annually in exports of U.S. meat
to the EEC.
   The United States argues that hormone-treated meat poses no
health hazard as the EEC contends and considers the ban a
protectionist measure.
   The United States has threatened to retaliate against imports
from the EEC which in turn has threatened a counter-retaliation.
   The hormone debate has been around for two years without the EEC
and the United States being able to resolve the dispute.
   De Clercq, Andriessen, Lyng and Yeutter last discussed the issue
at a meeting on Nov. 18.
   De Clercq denied press reports that since then the two sides have
come nearer a compromise and gave no indication the EEC was ready to
drop the ban.
   The EEC has offered to exempt meat for pet food from its ban and
raise imports of top-quality U.S. beef if it is free of hormones.
   The United States has accepted the pet food proposal but has said
the high-grade beef proposal did not remove America's fundamental
objections to the EEC ban.

<HEAD>EEC Commission Seeks To Ban Noisy Planes After 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The EEC Commission, seeking to cut noise
levels near airports, Wednesday proposed European Economic Community
airlines be banned from adding five plane models to their fleets as
of Nov. 1, 1990.
   The proposal, if adopted by the 12 EEC states, will prevent EEC
airlines from adding some versions of these models: the DC-9, Boeing
727, 737 and 747 and the BAC 1-11.
   The airlines were certified before 1977 and are too noisy to
remain in service after Nov. 1, 1990, the Commission said.
   Models that came into service after 1977, including the Boeing
757 and 765 and the Airbus 320, ``meet a stricter set of (internally
accepted) noise standards,'' the Commission added.
   It did not propose banning all pre-1977 aircraft models, such as
the Airbus-300, the Tristar, the DC 9-80 and the Boeing 737-300,
``which can be re-engined or fitted with `hush kits' to reduce their
noise.''
   For the time being, the Commission said, older aircraft that do
not meet the strictest noise standards ``can still be used and sold
in the Community and outside but cannot be imported into (EEC)
member states from third countries.''
   The Commission said its proposal ``would lead to a substantial
cut in noise'' levels at EEC airports.
   ``It is the short and medium-haul flights which tend to be
noisiest since long-haul planes'' generally meet noise standards
laid down in the Convention on International Civil Aviation.
   The Commission asked the 12 EEC governments for a quick decision.
   ``The United States and the Nordic countries are already working
on new legislation for aircraft noise....If the Community is to have
an influence over the development of these plans, it must take quick
decisions on an agreed Community position,'' the commission said.

<TEXT>
   Burlington Northern Inc. has agreed to pay Houston
Lighting and Power Co. $58 million to settle a coal-transport
dispute.
   HL&P, and its fuel-supply affiliate, Utility Fuels Inc., sued
Seattle-based Burlington Northern and four other railroad companies
in July 1986 claiming they conspired to block construction of a coal
slurry pipeline from Wyoming to Texas and Arkansas.
   Energy Transportation Systems Inc. was to build the pipeline to
carry pulverized coal mixed with water from the Powder River Basin
in Wyoming and Montana primarily to HL&P's coal-fired plants in
Texas.
   But due to the alleged conspiracy, ETSI canceled the project.
   ETSI separately sued the five railway companies. Burlington
Northern said it agreed to pay ETSI a $100 million cash payment on
Dec. 1, and deferred payments of $25 million plus interest on Dec.
1, 1989, 1990 and 1991.
   Burlington Northern is the third defendant to settle with HL&P.
The utility had previously settled with Chicago and Northwestern
Railroad and Union Pacific Railway, but HL&P declined to give
separate settlement amounts.
   Meanwhile, the case is scheduled to go to trial in Janaury 1989
with the other two defendants, Atchinson, Topeka and Santa Fe
Railway Co. and Kansas City Southern Railway Co.
   Burlington Northern confirmed it agreed to adjust HL&P's rates on
the remaining 12 years of a long-term contract to transport coal
from the Powder River Basin to HL&P plants in Texas.
   HL&P spokesman Floyd LeBlanc said the settlement won't affect the
light company's application for a $432 million rate-hike request.
   HL&P is petitioning the state Public Utilities Commission for a
base-rate increase to recover the cost of building two generating
stations _ a coal-fired unit in Limestone County and the first unit
of the South Texas Nuclear Project near Bay City.

<TEXT>
   The EEC Commission asked the European
Economic Community states Wednesday to recognize each other's
driver's licences, establish uniform speed limits for trucks and
buses and adopt a common maximum allowable level of alcohol in a
driver's blood.
   The proposals are part of a road safety package designed to
reduce traffic accidets in the 12 EEC nations that annually kill
50,000 people and injure 1.6 million others.
   ``Every year the number of people killed on our roads is
equivalent to the population of a small town,'' Stanley Clinton
Davis, the EEC Transport Commissioner said in a statement.
   He proposed a driver's license issued in one EEC state be valid
in another state if its holder lives there. EEC nationals must now
exchange their licences within one year after moving to another EEC
state.
   Clinton Davis proposed these maximum speed limits throughout the
EEC:
   _100 kilometers per hour (62.1 mph) for buses on express highways
and 80 kph (49.7 mph) on other roadways outside cities.
   _80 kph (49.7 mph) for trucks on express highways and 70 kph
(43.4 mph) on other roadways.
   No uniform speed limit was given for automobiles. A Commission
source said that issue was considered to be politically too
sensitive.
   Up to half of all fatal road accidents involve adults who have
been drinking and the Commission proposed the EEC states fix a
maximum allowable level of alcohol in a driver's blood of 0.5
milligrams per milliliter of blood.
   Currently only the Netherlands and Portugal maintain that level.
The other 10 EEC nations use 0.8 mg@ml as a maximum level.
   The Commission proposed that the alcohol content proposal be
adopted as of 1993 throughout the EEC but gave no implementation
date for its speed limit and driver's license proposals.
   ``The deaths and injuries represent an enormous cost in terms of
human suffering and the use of resources,'' Clinton Davis said.
   ``We must act to imporve road safety and I am sure that the
proposals we have put forward will make a significant contribution.''

   Fujitsu America Inc. will build a major
office, research and manufacturing facility in this Dallas suburb,
the Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday, citing unidentified
sources.
   ``It involves 5,000 to 6,000 people and a huge new corporate
complex,'' a source familiar with the negotiations who asked not to
be identified said. ``This is something they have been looking at
for several months.''
   Fujitsu America spokesman David Gould of the firm's San Jose,
Calif., headquarters Tuesday would neither confirm nor deny the
report.
   Sources in real estate told the newspaper that Fujitsu has
contracted to buy about 100 acres just north of the Dallas County
line in Collin County and plans to construct a 1 million-square-foot
office, research and manufacturing complex. The firm already has an
office and manufacturing facility in Richardson that employs about
300 people.
   The announcement of the plan will be made next month, sources
said. The newspaper did not say whether Fujitsu's headquarters would
be moved from San Jose or how many employees would remain there.
   Fujitsu America is the U.S. subsidiary of Fujitsu Ltd., based in
Tokyo, is a worldwide electronics company that had revenues of $16.4
billion in 1987.
   The Fujitsu consolidation and relocation would be the third big
economic development for the Dallas area in the past 30 days.
   Two weeks ago, GTE Corp. announced it was moving its national
telephone headquarters from Stamford, Conn., to Irving in a move
that would bring about 3,000 people to the area and create about
1,000 new jobs.
   It was only about three weeks ago that federal officials
announced plans to build the Superconducting Super Collider research
complex to Waxahachie, about 30 miles south of Dallas. That project
would create several thousand jobs.

^Wright Pushes Dems' Call for Quick Bush Budget</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright today called on
President-elect George Bush to reject the suggestions of some of his
own advisers and instead move quickly to submit his own budget plan
to Congress as a way of calming jittery financial markets.
   In making the suggestion, Wright joined a chorus of Democrats who
in recent days have been turning up the pressure on Bush to spell
out his own ideas for cutting the federal deficit by an estimated
$35 billion in the next fiscal year.
   Bush has been silent on the question of whether he will submit
his own spending plan or simply go directly into negotiations with
Congress over the 1990 budget.
   Under law, President Reagan must submit a budget for 1990 by Jan.
9. While Bush would have the option of submitting his own budget
plan to Congress once he takes office Jan. 20, as Reagan did in
1981, some of Bush's advisers have been urging the president-elect
to skip this step.
   Wright and other Democrats want to force Bush to be specific on
how he would cut the deficit without raising taxes and still keep
his other campaign promises to boost spending in such areas as
education, day care and environmental cleanup.
   ``At the beginning of a new presidential term, we want very much
to give the new president ample opportunity to address these
problems in his own budget recommendations,'' Wright said. ``We
trust that he will submit those recommendations no later than the
middle of February so that our budget committees can consider them
carefully, weigh them against the nation's needs and make such
modifications as the legislative branch is required to make in time
for the passage of the budget resolution.''
   Wright's comments came in remarks to the National Economic
Commission, a high-level advisory group created by Congress to draft
a deficit-reduction plan.
   Another speaker before the commission today, former Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker, echoed warnings made two weeks
ago by his successor, Alan Greenspan, that there was a growing
urgency for the government to reduce the deficit.
   Volcker said the risk of doing nothing would ultimately raise the
danger of a ``severe recession, spreading abroad, and characterized
by strong doubt about American leadership.''
   ``The effort now must be to get the deficit down,'' Volcker said.
``It is essential to support what can and should be a strong economy
competitive in world markets and capable of many more years of
sustained growth.''
   Most of the witnesses before the commission warn of the economic
dangers awaiting the country if the Bush administration does not
deal quickly with the deficit.
   Behind the scenes, commission members are anxiously awaiting word
from the Bush camp on what role the new administration sees for the
commission.
   The first sign will be Bush's choice for the final two people to
complete the 14-member advisory group. Supporters of the commission
are hoping that Bush will name pragmatists along the lines of Bush's
choice as budget director, Richard Darman.
   They believe that would be the best sign that Bush wants to use
the panel, which was created by Congress, as a vehicle for crafting
a compromise with Congress to end the seven-year stalemate over the
budget deficit.
   In an effort to reassure the markets, Bush has said that he sees
attacking the deficit as his top priority but he has not provided
any specifics on what he plans to do about it. He says he will name
his administration's negotiators with Congress on his first day in
office.
   Various groups have weighed in with opinions on how Bush should
attack the budget deficit, which last year climbed to $155.1 billion
and is projected by many economists to hit $165 billion this year.
   The Council on Competitiveness, composed of 157 chief executives
from business, organized labor and higher education, was presenting
the deficit commission today with a list of proposals showing that
the deficit could be trimmed by $120 billion by 1993 with a
combination of $48 billion in spending reductions, $48 billion in
new taxes and $24 billion in savings on interest payments on the
national debt.
   John D. Ong, chairman of B.F. Goodrich & Co. and the project
leader for the council's report, said the executives were unable to
come up with any credible deficit reduction plan that avoided
increasing taxes, something Bush has pledged not to do.
   ``We determined that reducing the deficit on the spending side of
the ledger alone could undermine national security and erode
benefits for some of the nation's neediest citizens,'' Ong told
reporters at a briefing Tuesday.
   Among the higher taxes the council suggested were a boost in
excise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, which would raise $8 billion
annually; a 20-cent-per-gallon increase in the gasoline tax, which
would raise $20 billion annually, and higher income tax rates for
families earning more than $220,350 a year, which could bring in $7
billion in additional revenues, the council said.
   Meanwhile, the Reagan administration is rushing to complete its
final spending plan, which must be submitted to Congress on Jan. 9.
   Officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that
Reagan will use his final budget to make one last effort to overhaul
the way the government goes abou spending money, including a
recommendation to switch from one-year to two-year spending plans.
   Other longtime Reagan proposals that will reappear include
presidential authority to veto individual items in appropriations
bills and a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget.
   While Reagan will leave office without getting any of his pet
changes adopted, advisers to Bush have given indications the new
administration will take up the fight for some of them, in
particular the switch to two-year budgets.

   Prices moved narrowly higher in quiet trading on
Wall Street today while investors awaited Friday's release of the
government's unemployment report for November.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 4.80 to
2,106.33 as of 11 a.m. EST.
   Advancing issues had a margin of about 7-to-5 over decliners,
with 655 stocks rising, 462 declining and 549 unchanged on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Big Board volume was a light 42.44 million shares at mid-morning.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks was up 0.45
to 152.88. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
was up 0.47 to 292.67.
   The market failed to sustain the gains it chalked up on Tuesday,
when the Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 20 points.
   Analysts said many investors were reluctant to take major
positions in advance of Friday's report on employment.
   Jack Barbanel, an analyst with Gruntal & Co., said traders
believed a continued low unemployment level would prompt the Federal
Reserve Board to raise its discount rate. Higher interest rates are
bearish for Wall Street.
   The most actively traded issue today was Ohio Edison, up [ at 18~.
   RJR Nabisco was up 2 at 92~ as the food and tobacco company's
board met to consider takeover bids.
   Other gainers included Digital Equipment, up 1[ at 93| and UAL,
up 1 at 108{.

   Wheat futures prices were mostly lower while corn
and soybeans were mostly higher in early trading today on the
Chicago Board of Trade but the price changes were slight due to a
lack of significant news.
   Analysts said the light trading and marginal price movement that
characterized this morning's activity probably would continue for
the next couple of weeks, barring any unforeseen changes in supply
and demand.
   ``I don't think we're going have any real excitement in these
markets for a while,'' said Cathy Leow, an assistant vice president
of research with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York. ``The
factors that cause extreme strength or weakness just aren't in
place.''
   She said exports would be the key to the grain markets, while
soybean traders were keeping a close watch on weather conditions in
Argentina and Brazil.
   The weather has been unusually dry for soybean planting in South
America and if the dry conditions persist into the growing season,
U.S. soybean prices are likely to rise, Ms. Leow said.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to { cent lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.23{ a bushel; corn was }
cent to 1} cents higher with December at $2.58{ a bushel; oats were
{ cent to 1{ cents higher with December at $1.96 a bushel; soybeans
were 2} cents lower to 3 cents higher with January at $7.56 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .23 cent lower to .18 cent higher with December
at 72.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .30
cent higher with January at 82.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .10
cent lower to .25 cent higher with December at 39.45 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .73 cent to 1.40 cents higher with February
at 43.85 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures closed mixed on Tuesday while pork futures were
mostly higher.

<HEAD>Personal Income Up 1.8 Percent In October</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A large increase in farm subsidy payments and
bonuses to auto workers pushed Americans' personal income up 1.8
percent in October, the steepest rise in a year, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department said income rose $72.1 billion to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.18 trillion last mont,
following modest increases of 0.5 percent in September and 0.4
percent in August.
   It was the largest increase since October 1987 when income shot
up 2.0 percent, also on the strength of farm subsidies.
   ``It's continuing good news,'' said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. ``The economy is proceeding on an even keel.''
   The department attributed about half of last month's increase to
farm and auto payments. Excluding those factors, income would have
risen a still hefty 0.9 percent.
   Today's report is the latest in a series of indicators showing
the economy boomed in October. The unemployment rate was at a
14-year low of 5.3 percent, factories were operating at the highest
rate in 8{ years, and retailers enjoyed the strongest sales gain in
seven months.
   Personal consumption spending, which includes everything except
interest payments on debt, was up a robust 0.8 percent to an annual
rate of $3.30 trillion following a weak 0.1 percent rise in
September.
   The biggest spending increase last month was for services, up 1.4
percent, followed by a 0.6 percent increase for nondurable goods.
Spending on durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three or more years, fell 0.6 percent.
   With income rising faster than spending, Americans saved more
than in any month since October 1987. The personal savings rate _
savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ was 5.2 percent, up
from 4.2 percent in September.
   Disposable, or after-tax income, was up 1.9 percent last month,
also the largest increase in a year, after rising 0.6 percent a
month earlier.
   Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, were up a
strong 1.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $2.51
trillion, bolstered by a 2.1 percent increase in manufacturing
salaries. The auto bonuses accounted for about 60 percent of the
manufacturing increase.
   Farm income rose a huge 76.2 percent to an annual rate of $46.7
billion, largely because of government payments for corn harvested
in 1987.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. called today for spending $30 billion next year to shut down
the ``worst losers'' in the savings and loan industry.
   ``We need to close the worst first,'' FDIC Chairman L. William
Seidman said in a luncheon speech to the National Press Club. ``...
These institutions are losing over a billion dollars per month.''
   Seidman's agency insures deposits in commercial banks, not thrift
institutions, but his agency is offering recommendations for solving
the crisis in the savings and loan industry.
   Some analysts recommend tapping Seidman's fund, a move he
opposes, and estimate that the S&L cleanup will eventually cost $50
billion to $100 billion.
   The Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation, which insuring
deposits in thrift institutions, is technically insolvent.
Regulators have been spending as little cash as possible, putting
together rescue packages with promissory notes and guarantees
committing revenue they expect to receive for the next 30 years from
an assessment on healthy S&Ls.
   Few analysts believe the industry can bear such a burden for that
long.
   Seidman did not call directly for a taxpayer bailout, saying
only, ``It's up to the Treasury Department and Congress to determine
which alternative makes the most sense.''
   He said that the S&L industry ``certainly can contribute its
part'' but added that ``beyond that contribution, the government
must find the resources to meet this problem.''
   Seidman's recommendation to quickly close about 90 seriously
insolvent S&Ls differs sharply from the views of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, responsible for regulating the nation's 3,028
federally insured S&Ls.
   The bank board's approach has been to rescue most failed S&Ls and
keep them open, fearing that massive closings would leave some
regions without service and devastate local economies by flooding
the market with foreclosed real estate.
   Others, including former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter,
and Congress' General Accounting Office, say it will be cheaper in
the long run to spend heavily now to close failed S&Ls as soon as
possible.
   On Tuesday, bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said S&L losses
shrank dramatically last quarter as the federal government
transferred the red ink onto its own books through rescues and
closings.
   S&Ls lost $1.52 billion in the July-September quarter, down 60
percent from losses of $3.82 billion in the second quarter and $3.93
billion in the first, he said.
   Wall also hinted at the recommendation his agency plans to offer
next month for financing the S&L rescue effort.
   He told reporters that the plan resembles this year's rescue of
the Farm Credit System, which featured borrowing backed by the
Treasury and a special board including the Treasury secretary to
oversee bailout spending.
   ``What we have on the agenda isn't far from that,'' Wall said. He
declined to elaborate.
   The $9.27 billion in S&L losses through Sept. 30 already have
topped last year's post-Depression record of $7.8 billion.
   Wall attributed the partial stemming of the red ink last quarter
to the more than 140 closings and forced mergers of failed S&Ls so
far this year. He said the bank board hopes to have handled 200 by
the end of the year.
   Some analysts and members of Congress have criticized the deals
because the bank board, lacking cash to spend immediately, agrees to
absorb much of the rescued institutions' future losses. They say
losses will continue to mount, showing up later as obligations of
the government's S&L deposit insurance fund rather than on the
industry's books.
   Wall argues, however, that the rescues reduce losses by achieving
efficiency through mergers and by eliminating insolvent
institutions' need to run up the eventual costs to the government by
offering high interest rates to attract deposits.

<HEAD>EEC Again Criticizes U.S. Stand On Agriculture in GATT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The EEC repeated its criticism of U.S.
agricultural policy Wednesday, saying it was endangering the Uruguay
round of world trade talks within the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
   EEC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq, speaking of next
week's mid-term review of the GATT talks in Montreal, reiterated the
EEC's longstanding objection to U.S. insistence that all farm
subsidies be eliminated.
   The European Economic Community favors reducing, not abolishing
such subsidies.
   ``I think our American friends are aware that they are calling
into question the entire negotiation,'' De Clercq told reporters.
   He said the United States, which until recently insisted that
subsidies be eliminated by the year 2000, has adjusted its target
date.
   But that has not fundamentally changed the U.S. position, he
added.
   De Clercq also criticized the United States for its stand in GATT
on tropical products, a sector of prime importance to negotiators in
the Uruguay round of trade liberalization talks that began in 1986.
   He said the EEC had set an example for others by proposing to
reduce barriers to imports of tropical products.
   But he cautioned the EEC will not cut such barriers on its own
without parallel action by other industrialized countries such as
the United States.
   ``We regret that the United States has made no offer at all,'' De
Clercq said.
   He said the Reagan administration continued to tie this area to
progress in the agricultural sector, terming that a ``dangerous
attitude.''
   De Clercq said he expected the Montreal negotiations to be
``difficult'' adding, ``The Uruguay round is more of an obstacle
course than a sprint.''

<HEAD>Last-Minute Snag Imperils Sun-Times Contract Ratification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By F.N. D'ALESSIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for the Chicago Sun-Times and its
newsroom employees today scheduled another round of contract
negotiations after a clause on pension-fund contributions
jeopardized their tentative labor pact.
   A bargaining session was set for Thursday morning, officials said.
   ``It's progress,'' said newspaper spokesman Michael Soll. ``It
means sitting down and reasoning again.''
   ``We hope it can be resolved,'' said Linda Lenz, a union
spokeswoman and an education writer for the Sun-Times. ``Things will
not drag on. We are determined not to let them drag on.''
   The dispute revived the chance of a strike at the city's
second-largest newspaper.
   When informed of the last-minute snag, members of Newspaper Guild
Local 71 postponed a vote on the tentative contract late Tuesday and
told union bargainers to seek new talks.
   ``We are disappointed that the guild did not unanimously
recommend approval of the company's offer as it had agreed to do,''
Soll said today.
   ``The company's offer included two separate pension alternatives
with the guild having the option to select one or the other. ...
Apparently the guild selected an alternative which it did not fully
understand,'' he said, reading a company statement.
   Ratification by the local's 250 members seemed little more than a
formality until union leaders studied specific language on pensions
in an outline provided earlier Tuesday by Sun-Times management.
   The Sun-Times said the new pension formula, which has increased
contributions from the company, takes effect Jan. 1. Union
bargainers, though, said they believed it would be retroactive to an
earlier date.
   ``Neither I nor the unit chairman, Tom Gibbons, recall any
indication made by the company about that since you don't take notes
... on things that aren't said,'' guild official Gerry Minkkinen
said.
   Soll said: ``Management has full notes describing the agreement.
And the (federal) mediator agrees with the management.''
   But Ms. Lenz said the federal mediator's notes ``were silent on
the issue. Similarly, our (Guild) notes do not reflect what the
company claims they said.''
   A strike was planned for Nov. 21, but was postponed as bargainers
tried to get a contract.
   The next day, bargainers reached agreement on a three-year pact
that offered a $500 payment in the first year, followed by 3 percent
wage increases in each of the remaining two years.
   The proposed contract also included improvements in sick leave,
hospitalization, maternity leave, indemnification from libel
lawsuits and minority hiring and training programs.
   As a result of the new development, guild spokesman Daniel
Lehmann, the newspaper's religion reporter, said another strike date
could be set.
   After Tuesday night's meeting, many newsroom employees were angry.
   ``We have to have an acceptable contract,'' said Shane Gericke, a
member of the negotiating committee, who described the guild
bargainers as being ``on a very short leash.''
   Lehmann called the pension language ``one of the major elements
of the new contract.''
   Newsroom employees have been working without a contract since
June 1.
   The Sun-Times has an estimated circulation of 605,000 daily and
614,000 on Sundays. The Chicago Tribune's circulation is estimated
at 765,000 daily and 1.11 million on Sundays.

   Prices advanced on Wall Street today as activity
in takeover stocks sparked interest in other issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 12.98 to
2,114.51 as of 2 p.m. EST.
   Advancing issues had a nearly 2-to-1 edge over decliners, with
885 stocks rising, 480 declining and 510 unchanged on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Among broader measures, the NYSE's composite index of all its
listed stocks was up 1.30 to 153.73. On the American Stock Exchange,
the market value index was up 1.21 to 293.41.
   Big Board volume totaled 104.16 million shares with two hours of
trading to go.
   Michael Metz, a market analyst with Oppenheimer & Co., said
activity in takeover targets such as RJR Nabisco and Pillsbury led
to buying of other stocks.
   RJR Nabisco managers, who are among the three bidders for the
food and tobacco giant, today boosted their offer to more than $24.3
billion, or $108 a share. The company's stock shot up 2| to 93{
after the new bid was announced.
   Metz said investors also believed that Pillsbury _ which again
rejected Grand Metropolitan PLC's $5.23 billion, or $60-a-share, bid
_ would receive a higher offer. Pillsbury was up | to 58{ today.
   The developments piqued the interest of speculators, Metz said.
   ``People are looking for the next game to play,'' he said.
   Some traders were still on the sidelines, awaiting Friday's Labor
Department report on unemployment in November and fearing it could
prompt the Federal Reserve Board to tighten credit further.
   The most actively traded issue today was Ohio Edison, up [ at 18~.
   Among the other gainers, Digital Equipment was up 1[ to 93|, UAL
rose 1{ to 109 and Dow Chemical was up 1\ to 85\.

   Share prices strengthened Wednesday on the London
Stock Exchange but a lack of news kept the market almost static.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended the day
up 5.5 points, or 0.30 percent, at 1,792.4, the lowest point of the
session. The index reached a high of 1,801.3 at mid-morning and then
drifted lower for the rest of the day.
   At the close, the narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up
2.6 points at 1,458.0.
   Volume totaled 444.8 million shares, up from 408.4 million on
Tuesday.
   Dealers said market players seemed to be more interested in the
currency markets after the key British interest rate was raised
Friday to 13 percent, the highest among the leading Western nations.
   The stock market was also holding back to see the response to the
flotation of state-run British Steel. The offer for shares closes
Friday. If there is only a lukewarm response it won't do much good
for share prices in general because of the uncertainty created by
the interest rate hike, rising inflation and the widening British
trade deficit.
   The Financial Times index of 500 shares closed at 1,013.38, up
3.46.

<HEAD>OPEC Accord Not Sufficient to Raise Prices to $18, Venezuela Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC's new oil accord alone will not be
sufficient to raise petroleum prices to the cartel's $18 per barrel
benchmark, Venezuela's oil minister said Wednesday.
   Energy Minister Julio Cesar Gil said that non-OPEC oil exporters
also must reduce their output to help push prices up by roughly $6
from current crude levels.
   ``We cannot arrive at $18 only with the accord. It is essential
to count on the non-OPEC countries,'' Gil said.
   Gil said Venezuela, one of the founding members of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, will begin contacting
nine independent nations which have indicated a willingness to work
with OPEC to reduce the glut of world oil that has kept prices weak.
   The nations include Mexico, Colombia, Malaysia, Oman, Egypt,
China, Norway, Angola and the Soviet Union, he said.
   OPEC concluded its thorny winter session on Sunday by agreeing to
reduce oil production from an estimated 22 million barrels a day to
18.5 million barrels. The cartel hopes the new agreement will lift
prices to the $18 level in the first half of 1989.
   Gil said he spoke with Mexican oil minister Fernando Yriart
Valderrama Monday and that contacts would be renewed following that
country's change of government on Thursday.
   The minister said his country also was satisfied with the
definition of condensates adopted at the conference, which includes
an American Petroleum Institute weight as one of five defining
elements.
   Condensates are petroleum gases which condense into liquids at
normal atmospheric pressure. Venezuela produces about 180,000
barrels a day of condensates, which are not included in OPEC oil
output quotas.
   He said the conference approved a ``scientific, technical
definition which is in agreement with the elements proposed by our
experts.'' The new definition prevents the reclassification of
crudes as condensates, he said.
   But he said an API grade ranging between 45 and 50 degrees is one
of five factors OPEC experts will take into account when defining a
condensate. Earlier, Venezuela had insisted on a definition that did
not include an API grade.
   He said the definition also allowed for an ``intermediate''
product which would be a ``temporary crude'' or a ``temporary
condensate.'' Other elements include gas@liquid ratios and octane
ratings, he said.
   Gil praised OPEC's new 18.5 million barrel production agreement
as ``giving OPEC again the credibility that it is capable of
organizing the world oil market.''
   He said the conference decided that oil loans between OPEC
members would be credited to the quota of the receiving nation.
   Gil said Venezuela hoped to increase its oil export revenue next
year by between $1.5 and $2 billion as a result of higher oil prices
and its new 1.64 million barrel-a-day quota.
   The new quota represents a 65,000 barrel increase over the old
one but a reduction in Venezuela's share of total OPEC production to
8.8 percent, from 9.5 percent.
   Venezuela's income from oil, petrochemicals and coal this year is
expected to be around $7.1 billion, assuming an average price of
about $13.50 per barrel, which does not include Tuesday's price hike
of one dollar per barrel for some of Venezuela's exports, he said.

<HEAD>Wall Street Leaders Resigned to Bank Entry into Securities Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street leaders are increasingly
concluding _ and admitting _ that they aren't going to win their
decade-long battle to keep banks out of the stocks and bonds
business.
   The latest sign of their retreat from the lobbying effort came
here Wednesday when the head of the Street's main trade group said
the organization no longer opposes repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act
of 1933.
   The measure, one of many financial reforms instituted in the
Depression, set sharp boundaries between the financial services that
banks and brokers could offer.
   But in more recent times, institutions of both types have been
making intense assaults on each other's turf.
   The Securities Industry Association would ``like to see
Glass-Steagall resolved,'' said its chairman, John Bachmann, who is
also managing principal of the brokerage firm Edward D. Jones & Co.
in St. Louis.
   ``We'd like to get that behind us,'' he said.
   The SIA's current position now closely matches that of many
regulators, who argue that Glass-Steagall restrictions have outlived
their usefulness and are unnecessarily restrictive.
   Addressing the group's annual convention Wednesday, Chairman Alan
Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board repeated his belief that ``it
is in the public interest that banks no longer be so circumscribed
in their securities activities.''
   The brokerage group qualifies its apparent acquiescence to this
form of deregulation. For example, the brokers argue that firms of
any type that take bank deposits and also sell securities like
stocks do so through separate subsidiaries kept apart by firm
protective barriers. The brokers say bankers should not be able to
use federal deposit insurance, for instance, to gain a competitive
advantage in marketing relatively risky investments like stocks.
   The SIA also urges that financial firms of all varieties be
subject to ``regulation by business.''
   In other words, bank activities involving stocks and bonds would
be overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which now
regulates traditional brokerage activities.
   Edward O'Brien, the SIA's president, said any move to dismantle
Glass-Steagall should proceed at a careful pace, in the context of
other financial problems. In particular, he said regulators probably
ought to deal first with the issue of numerous troubled savings and
loan institutions.

   Honda plans to increase its exports of
American-made cars from 12,000 this year to 70,000 in 1991, a move
that some analysts see as an effort to enter the European market.
   Honda of America Mfg. Inc. expects to export 50,000 cars to Japan
that year and 20,000 to other countries not yet specified, company
spokesman Roger Lambert said. Honda earlier this year began
exporting U.S.-built two-door Accord Coupes to its home country.
   The Accord Coupe is produced only at the Marysville plant, about
35 miles northwest of Columbus in central Ohio.
   Europe would be a likely market for Honda of America to
penetrate, John Franck, an analyst with Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia, said Wednesday. American companies stand to benefit
from lowered economic trade barriers that would result from the
merger of Europe into a single market by 1992.
   ``Where else would you go with them?'' Franck said. ``There are
no barriers for American exports in Europe in 1992 that I know of.''
   Under the current system, American companies are faced with
differing regulations in each of the 12 countries in the European
Community.
   Franck said the export of Hondas serves the company's auto supply
needs in Japan but also ``is an attempt to diffuse the idea of
shipping to Europe. They have been evasive in that area.''
   Lambert said Honda of America does not yet know which countries
to target for its 1991 exports.
   Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney
of New York City, also said Honda would be interested in the
European market.
   ``The specter of American-made Japanese cars is something that
the Europeans would find to be very paranoid about,'' she said.
``Who wants to have more competition?''
   Honda of America has been exporting motorcycles to world markets,
including Europe, since 1980. It also exports four-door Accord
sedans to Taiwan and Canada. The company plans to ship 4,500 cars to
Canada and 1,500 to Taiwan this year.
   Honda, the fourth-largest automaker in the United States, expects
to ship 6,000 Accord Coupes to Japan by the end of this year, up
from its original estimate of 4,000.
   Lambert said there has been strong demand for the car, with
orders for 2,000 Accord Coupes when the initial load of 540 cars
arrived last April. He said the cars aroused curosity in dealers and
customers.
   ``They asked, will these cars be as good as the cars that come
out of Japan?'' he said. ``When the first cars arrived, they were
put under the microscope ... and they were very well-received.''
   In Japan, the Coupe sells for 2.6 million yen, about $21,300 at
current exchange rates. A comparable car sells for $11,650 to
$15,300 in the United States, depending on equipment.
   Toshiaki Mishiba, a Honda dealer in Tokyo who has sold about 30
of the Coupes since April, said Japanese are attracted to the
left-side steering wheel in the U.S.-made Honda. Japanese cars have
the steering wheel on the right side.
   ``It gives Japanese an American feeling combined with confidence
in Honda's quality,'' Mishiba said. ``With its leather seats,
aluminum wheels and (American-made) Bose stereo system, it's
relatively cheap, about 300,000 yen ($2,500) less than a comparable
car sold in Japan.''
   Ms. Keller said the Accord Coupe, a new model this year, must
prove it is a well-made car that retains its value if the company is
to reach its export growth goals.
   ``The Japanese customer may very well be buying this car this
year because it's new, it's different. It has its badge of
distinction,'' Ms. Keller said.
   Honda began manufacturing in the United States in September 1979
with a motorcycle plant at Marysville. The auto plant at Marysville
began production of the Accord four-door sedan in November 1982, and
an engine plant at Anna in western Ohio started production in July
1985.
   The Civic four-door sedan was added to production at Marysville
in July 1986, and production of Civic engines began at Anna two
months later.
   Near the Marysville operation, Honda is building a new assembly
plant that is scheduled to begin production of Civic four-door
sedans in the fall of 1989.

   Stock prices moved higher on Wall Street today as
strength in the Treasury bond market eased some interest rate
worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 15.65 to
2,117.18 as of 3 p.m. EST.
   Advancing issues had a nearly 2-to-1 edge over decliners, with
975 stocks rising, 475 declining and 465 unchanged on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Among broader measures, the NYSE's composite index of all its
listed stocks was up 1.55 to 153.98. On the American Stock Exchange,
the market value index was up 1.51 to 293.71.
   Big Board volume totaled a moderate 130.18 million shares with
one hour of trading remaining.
   Robert Colby, a market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co., said continued strength in Treasury bond prices _ and a
resulting drop in interest rates _ helped improve the tone of the
stock market.
   By late afternoon, the government's bellwether 30-year bond was
up more than $6 per $1,000 in face value.
   Analysts said traders also took some comfort from a Federal
Reserve report that economic growth had slowed. The report raised
hopes that the Fed would not nudge interest rates higher.
   Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co., said activity in
takeover targets such as RJR Nabisco and Pillsbury led to buying of
other stocks.
   RJR Nabisco managers, who are among the three bidders for the
food and tobacco giant, today boosted their offer to more than $24.3
billion, or $108 a share. The company's stock _ the most actively
traded on the NYSE _ shot up 2{ to 93] after the new bid was
announced.
   Metz said investors also believed that Pillsbury _ which again
rejected Grand Metropolitan PLC's $5.23 billion, or $60-a-share, bid
_ would receive a higher offer. Pillsbury was up ~ to 58} today.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mostly
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, with substantial
gains in soybean and near-month corn futures partially linked to
first-notice day for the December contracts.
   Wednesday was the first day on which traders could formally
announce their intention to deliver wheat, corn, oats, soybean oil
and soybean meal against the contracts for delivery in December.
   First-notice days frequently are characterized by sharp price
movements because most traders play the market with no intention of
making or taking physical delivery of commodities, analysts said.
   There is no contract for December delivery of soybeans but the
rally in the soybean meal and oil pits helped boost soybean futures,
said Cathy Leow, an assistant vice president of research with
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   Dry weather in the South American soybean belt also contributed
to the rise in soybean futures prices, she said.
   At the close of trading, wheat was { cent lower to 1 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.24{ a bushel; corn
was 1{ cents to 4} cents higher with December at $2.61{ a bushel;
oats were unchanged to 5 cents higher with December at $1.95{ a

<HEAD>Dow Jones Agrees to Sell Stake in Cable Operator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones & Co. Inc. said Wednesday it has agreed
to sell its 17 percent interest in Continental Cablevision Inc. to
the privately-held cable television operator's chairman for $299.8
million.
   Continental Cablevision is based in Boston and is the nation's
third-largest cable operator with about 2.3 million subscribers in
15 states.
   Dow Jones said it had agreed to sell its stake in the company for
$270 a share to Chairman Amos Hostetter, who is also chief executive.
   It said under terms of the 1981 agreement in which it bought the
stake, Dow Jones must offer the company the right to repurchase its
shares on the same terms as agreed upon with Hostetter. Robert
Sachs, senior vice president for Continental Cablevision, said its
board has not yet considered the matter.
   Dow Jones, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's
magazine and provides electronic business information services, said
it had purchased a 24.5 percent stake in Continental Cablevision in
1981 for $25 a share.
   It subsequently sold part of that interest to the company in 1986
for $100 million, according to Dow Jones spokesman James Ambrosio.
   Dow Jones said its decision to sell the rest of its interest
``reflected the attractive gain'' in price of its stake compared
with what it paid in 1981.
   The company said it expects the deal to be closed in January
1989, and said it plans to use the anticipated $193 million in
after-tax proceeds to reduce its debt and for other unspecified
corporate purposes.
   According to Paul Kagan Associates Inc., a media research company
based in Carmel, Calif., Continental Cablevision ranked third among
the nation's multiple-system cable operators with nearly 2.3 million
subscribers at the end of August.
   The two largest operators are Telecommunications Inc., based in
Denver, with 4.3 million subscribers, and American Television and
Communications Corp., controlled by New York-based Time Inc., with
3.9 million subscribers, according to the Kagan ranking.
   Sachs said Continental Cablevision, founded in 1963, has cable
systems in 450 communities across the country, including sizeable
operations in New England, Ohio, California, Florida and Michigan.

<HEAD>Centel Seeks Buyer For Cable TV Unit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centel Corp. put its cable television unit on the
auction block Wednesday, two months after buying out a group of
dissident shareholders for $92.5 million and seven months after
declaring it was not selling any of its businesses.
   Chairman John P. Frazee Jr. said divestment of the Centel Cable
Television Co. would allow Centel to concentrate on its telephone
operations, which include local exchange service in nine states and
a fast-growing mobile cellular communications business that operates
in 13 states.
   Analysts estimated the value of Centel Cable at $1.4 billion.
Centel said in a statement that proceeds from the sale would be used
to repurchase shares and reduce indebtedness.
   But Frazee denied any connection between the decision to sell
Centel Cable and the more than $850 million that Centel paid out in
the past year to extend the reach of its cellular division and fight
a takeover battle.
   ``We can't be all things; we can't be as large in each one of
these three businesses as we would like to be,'' Frazee said in a
telephone interview from his Chicago office.
   ``We believe this decision will allow our shareholders to receive
full value from our cable television investment,'' Frazee said.
``More importantly, it will enable us to refocus our attention on
those businesses that have tremendous potential for enhancing
sharehoulder value.''
   Frazee would not speculate on the potential sale price of Centel
Cable, which serves more than 550,000 subscribers in Florida,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio.
   Centel Cable ranks 22nd among the top 50 U.S. cable operators and
should fetch about $25 per subscriber, or about $1.4 billion, said
Paula Greer, an industry analyst with Paul Kagan Associates Inc. of
Carmel, Calif.
   Ms. Greer said in an interview from her office in Mount Clemens,
Mich., that federal regulations prohibit companies from owning both
cable and telephone services in the same market, ``so it does make
sense that they would sell off the cable and concentrate on their
core business, which is telephone operations.''
   Centel Cable, accounted for $130 million of Centel's $1.48
billion in revenues last year and has been an industry leader in
deploying new technologies such as pay-per-view and fiber optics,
Centel said.
   Local telephone service provides the bulk of Centel's revenues,
accounting for nearly $825 million in sales last year.
   Last spring, Centel purchased United Telespectrum Inc., the
cellular subsidiary of Kansas City, Mo.-based United
Telecommunications, for $763 million plus $9.5 million in United
Telespectrum debt.
   Centel spent much of this year waging a proxy battle against its
largest shareholders, New York-based investors Asher B. Edelman and
George Lindemann, who sought to break up the company and sell the
pieces. Frazee had said in April that none of Centel's businesses
were for sale.
   Shareholders rejected the dissidents' takeover bid and in
September, Edelman and Lindemann sold their 5.5 percent stake back
to Centel.
   Centel still is seeking a buyer for its business telephone
systems business, which has been on the block since late May.

   The dollar fell slightly Wednesday after bearish
sentiment pulled it down from gains posted earlier in trading in
Europe. Gold prices rose.
   ``It was a war between the bulls and the bears,'' said Zlatko
Glamuzina, chief currency dealer of Banco di Sicilia in New York.
   The early rise in the dollar was based partly on expectations
that the Federal Reserve would push up U.S. interest rates to
control inflation. But a report to the Federal Reserve on Wednesday
said there was no indication that inflation was getting out of hand,
Glamuzina said.
   In addition to the report to the Fed, the dollar was hurt by a
big sell order and by action by the Bank of England, whose attempts
to keep the British pound from rising against the West German mark
had the effect of pressuring the dollar, Glamuzina said.
   Foreign-exchange dealers said trading was light and traders were
reluctant to take big positions ahead of new U.S. economic
statistics due Thursday and Friday.
   The Commerce Department is scheduled to report Thursday on the
index of leading economic indicators for October, and the Labor
Department is scheduled to report Friday on the November
unemployment rate.
   The Canadian dollar strengthened against the dollar, prompting
the Bank of Canada to sell the currency.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 121.85 Japanese yen, down from
122.15. In London late Wednesday the dollar traded at 122.05 yen. In
New York, the dollar fell to 121.48 yen from 121.83 on Tuesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8480 late Wednesday, more
expensive for buyers than Tuesday's late $1.8425. Later in New York,
the pound rose to $1.8535 from $1.8443 Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.7318 West German marks, down from 1.7348; 1.4498
Swiss francs, down from 1.4500; 1.1834 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1913; 5.9195 French francs, down from 5.9310; and 1,279.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,282.50.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.7375 West German marks, up from
1.7285; 1.4548 Swiss francs, up from 1.4481; 5.9327 French francs,
up from 5.9125; 1.9590 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9530; 1,284.97
Italian lire, up from 1,281.25; and 1.1872 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1930.
   Dealers said trading in gold was light and the improvement was
due to a rise in the price of platinum.
   Gold in Hong Kong closed at a bid of $422.62 a troy ounce, up
from $421.93.
   Gold closed in London at a bid of $423.25 a troy ounce, up from
$422.75 late Tuesday. The closing price in Zurich, Switzerland, was
$422.30 bid, up from $422.25.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $424.80 a troy ounce from $421.90.
   Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold rose to
$424.10 a troy ounce from $421.50.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.14 bid a troy ounce,
up from $6.09. On New York's Comex, silver rose to $6.136 a troy
ounce from $6.030.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is welcome at
the New York Stock Exchange if he can fit a visit into his schedule
next week, a spokesman for the exchange said Wednesday.
   ``He would be very welcome here, by the exchange and the American
business community,'' said Richard Torrenzano, a senior vice
president of the NYSE.
   He said Soviet officials have discussed the possibility of a
visit with NYSE officials. Gorbachev is said to be interested, but
might not have time, he added.

   Prices advanced on Wall Street Wednesday as
strength in the bond market allayed some trader concerns about
rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 12.98 to
2,114.51, giving the well-known barometer a gain of nearly 40 points
over the past three sssions.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by a better than 2-to-1
margin in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 995 issues up, 470 down and 502 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 157.81 million shares, up
from 127.42 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
186.13 million shares.
   Wednesday's activity mirrored trading in the previous session,
when the market drifted for the first half of the day and then
picked up steam in the afternoon.
   Analysts said gains in bond prices _ and corresponding declines
in yields _ eased some fears on Wall Street that interest rates will
continue to rise.
   By late afternoon, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond had
picked up $6 per $1,000 in face value, while its yield slipped to
9.06 percent from late Tuesday's 9.13 percent.
   A Federal Reserve report that economic growth has slowed further
calmed equity traders who are worried that the Fed will raise its
discount rate _ the interest it charges its member banks _ to
prevent the economy from overheating.
   But the level of activity indicated many investors are still
hesitant.
   ``The volume is better but not at levels where one would think
there's a lot of confidence or aggressive buying,'' said Robert
Colby, a market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Many traders were keeping a low profile in advance of Friday's
scheduled release of unemployment figures for November, believing
the Fed will raise the discount rate if the jobless figure remains
low. In October, the unemployment rate was 5.3 percent.
   Despite traders' hestitancy, analysts said they detected a better
tone in the market over the past few days.
   Colby, noting that stocks managed a small gain on Monday after
major banks raised their prime lending rates, said, ``The market
acted well in the face of bad news.''
   Analysts have attributed some of this week's gains to Wall
Street's oversold condition.
   ``We've had far too much bearishness and pessimism sows the seeds
for its own reversal,'' Colby said.
   Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co., said activity in
takeover stocks spilled over to other issues.
   ``People are looking for the next game to play,'' he said.
   The company involved in the biggest takeover battle in history,
RJR Nabisco, was the most actively traded stock on the NYSE. RJR
Nabisco's stock rose 2[ to 93 as the company's management offered to
pay more than $24.3 billion, or $108 a share, to buy the food and
tobacco giant.
   The stock of another takeover target, Pillsbury, was up 1] to 59\
after the food company's board again rejected a $5.23 billion, or
$60-per-share, offer from Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   Other big gainers included Warner Lambert, up 2] to 75], Dow
Chemical, up 1\ to 85], and Digital Equipment, up 1[ to 93|.
   Decliners included IBM, down ~ to 118{, and Xerox, off ] at 55.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $25.691 billion, or 0.96
percent, in value.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks picked
up 1.47 to 153.90.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 3.16 to 315.12, and S&P's
500-stock composite index picked up 2.79 to finish at 273.70.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market was up
3.30 to 371.45.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 2.16
to 294.36.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Rise Despite OPEC Skepticism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices surged in moderate trading
Wednesday amid encouraging signs about the latest OPEC agreement.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, settled 40
cents higher at $15.32 a barrel, near its high for the day of
$15.35. The contract price had fallen 11 cents a barrel on Tuesday.
Other contract months also rose, though not as sharply.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
December contract for unleaded gasoline soared 2.18 cents to finish
at 49.05 cents a gallon. The December contract for wholesale home
heating oil rose 0.53 cent to 48.32 cents a gallon. Other contract
months for both products also advanced.
   Analysts said two encouraging developments helped strengthen
prices.
   Non-OPEC oil-producing countries are showing signs of wanting to
cooperate with OPEC countries to help reduce the glut of oil on
world markets, said Bob Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   ``That's very important psychologically,'' Baker said. ``It's not
that non-OPEC countries are going to cut back much, but it could
show some positive response.''
   In addition, the oil minister from the United Arab Emirates
continued to make efforts to soften remarks he made on Monday that
his country did not consider its new OPEC production quota the
``official'' quota.
   On Monday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
signed a new agreement to limit the cartel's production to 18.5
million barrels a day from the present level of around 22.5 million.
The cartel also maintained its benchmark price of $18 a barrel,
which it hopes to achieve in the first half of 1989.
   Analysts said Wednesday's oil futures prices also were helped by
bullish weekly statistics on U.S. inventories from the American
Petroleum Institute and the expiration of the December contracts on
the Mercantile Exchange.
   Late Tuesday, new weekly API data showed declines in crude and
gasoline inventories. Gasoline stocks dropped 2.5 million barrels
last week and crude stocks fell 2.6 million.

<HEAD>Platinum Soars On Tight Supplies, Technical Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices rocketed above $600 a troy ounce for the
first time in nearly six months Wednesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on buying linked to fears of dwindling supplies.
   On other markets, gold and silver futures also rose; pork bellies
were sharply higher while livestock futures were mixed; sugar
futures were sharply lower; and energy, grains, soybeans and
stock-index futures all advanced.
   Platinum for delivery in January soared the $25 daily limit to
$609.40 an ounce during the trading session but settled at $608.70,
up $24.30 from Tuesday and the highest daily settlement since June 6.
   Other contracts finished $20.80 to $22.30 higher.
   Platinum was trading around $500 an ounce just two months ago.
The scenario for the white metal turned bullish in early October
when the large British platinum refiner Johnson Matthey PLC
predicted production shortfalls in 1988 through 1993.
   Wednesday's rally took hold as speculators bid the price for
January delivery up through several technical resistance points.
Buying interest accelerated as the price approached $600, analysts
said.
   ``The key thing was to take out resistance around $595 _ that's
where the market had been having trouble,'' said Craig Sloane,
metals analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``Once you did
that, you were in a different ball game.''
   Strong psychological resistance was cracked at the $600 mark,
triggering a new round of buy orders, said Peter Cardillo, metals
analyst with Josephthal & Co. in New York.
   ``Based on today's close, we should attempt to reach the highs
registered six months back, around the $625-to-$630 area,'' he said.
   Silver futures posted sharp gains on platinum's coattails. But
the advance was more subdued in the inflation-sensitive gold market,
which also responded to a Federal Reserve Board report that said the
economy was growing at a slower pace than several other indicators
have suggested.
   Gold settled $2.10 to $2.90 higher with December at $424.80 a
troy ounce; silver was 9.6 cents to 10.6 cents higher with December
at $6.136 a troy ounce.
   Prices of frozen pork-belly futures surged on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange on mostly technical buying inspired by the
February contract's rise above 43.50 cents a pound, last week's high.
   ``That brought in a tremendous amount of buying and it just
perpetuated itself,'' said Paul Hare, a livestock market analyst
with Linnco Futures Inc. in Chicago.
   Hog futures rallied in sympathy with the pork bellies while
cattle futures retreated, also on technically inspired selling, he
said.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .78 cent lower with December at
72.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .28 cent lower
with January at 82.42 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent to .37 cent
higher with December at 39.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1.42 cents to 1.67 cents higher with February at 44.52 cents a
pound.
   Sugar futures dipped amid profit-taking following four straight
days of higher prices on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange.
   Sugar settled .19 cent to .28 cent lower with March at 11.07
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices finished mostly higher on the
Chicago Board of Trade, with substantial gains in soybean and
near-month corn futures partially linked to the peculiarities of
first-notice day.
   Wednesday was the first day on which traders could formally
announce their intention to deliver wheat, corn, oats, soybean oil
and soybean meal against the December contracts.
   Rallies are typical of first-notice days, analysts said, with
commercial players positioning themselves to take delivery.
   Dry weather in the South American soybean belt contributed to the
rise in soybean futures, for which there is no December delivery.
   Wheat settled { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with December at
$4.24} a bushel; corn was 1} cents to 4{ cents higher with December
at $2.61\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 5 cents higher with
December at $1.95{ a bushel; soybeans were 5\ cents lower to 10
cents higher with January at $7.63} a bushel.
   Unleaded gasoline futures surged on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in response to the American Petroleum Institute's report of
a 2.5-million-barrel drawdown in U.S. gasoline stocks last week.
Crude oil and heating oil futures also rallied.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 5 cents to 40 cents higher
with January at $15.32 a barrel; heating oil was .53 cent to .76
cent higher with December at 48.32 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .55 cent to 2.18 cents higher with December at 49.05 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced moderately on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 settled 1.90 points higher at 273.05. Each point is worth
$500.

<HEAD>Oil Producers Optimistic About OPEC Agreement</HEAD>

   OPEC's agreement to limit production and
boost prices is good news to independent Oil Patch producers, but
most call the pact more of a life-support system than a cure for the
ailing domestic industry.
   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed Monday to limit productin to 18.5 million barrels a day and
bring prices back up near $18 a barrel beginning in January.
Analysts estimate that the cartel currently pumps about 22.5 million
barrels a day.
   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman's assertion that crude oil prices
could reach $18 by June comes as good news to Texas oil producers,
who have seen prices gyrate in 1988. West Texas Intermediate, the
U.S. benchmark crude, fell to $13.75 a barrel in October from a high
of $17.92 in April.
   ``It looks very encouraging,'' said Bill Kleine, president of
Permian Corp., a producer based in Midland, Texas.
   But because OPEC members agreed on the production ceiling only
for six months, the pact isn't expected to improve the long-term
environment for domestic producers, oil leaders say.
   While the prospect of $18-a-barrel oil will benefit small,
independent producers in the short term, those producers will
continue to struggle in an uncertain environment, said Mickey
Thompson, the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association's vice
president for governmental affairs.
   ``Even at $18 a barrel, we're not looking at a major resurgence
as far as exploration or drilling,'' he said.
   ``But we're not about to look a gift horse in the mouth, either.
It may at least keep us alive for another six months.''
   Immediately following the announcement, several large purchasers
of crude raised their posted prices, some by as much as $2 a barrel.
   Phillips Petroleum Co. increased the price it will pay producers
in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles to $14.25 a barrel from $12.25,
while Marathon Oil hiked its posted prices by $2, to $14.75.
   ``That's an extremely hopeful sign that prices will, one,
stabilize somewhat and, two, increase,'' Thompson said. ``We need a
shot in the arm.''
   But unless prices rise above $20, domestic drilling activity
won't show much of an increase, with or without the OPEC agreement,
said Don L. Evans, president of TMBR-Sharp Drilling Co. in Midland.
   ``It's a hopeful sign, but as far as translating into a dramatic
increase in the rig count, it doesn't equal that,'' he said. ``I
don't see that changing budgets dramatically for 1989.''
   Major producers such as Phillips and Conoco Inc. also take a
cautious view toward the pact.
   ``We don't make our plans on the assumption that OPEC is going to
do one thing or another,'' said Al Hegburg, Phillips' director for
international affairs and government relations. ``We don't adjust
our strategy according to what OPEC does. We just watch with
interest.''
   But Texas Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance, who attended part of
the OPEC meetings in Vienna, Austria, is more optimistic about the
agreement, saying it should boost drilling activity, stabilize oil
prices at between $16 and $18 a barrel within two months and help
state revenues.
   ``This is not going to be a boon for the energy industry in
Texas,'' said the member of the body that regulates the state's oil
and gas industry. ``But it's certainly not going to be a bust.''

<HEAD>Illegal Farm Workers Make Last-Minute Applications for Residency</HEAD>

   Farm workers who are in the country illegally faced a midnight
Wednesday deadline to apply for residency, and immigration officials
said many have provided false documentation in a desperate attempt
to avoid deportation.
   ``We're concerned that there are high levels of fraud in the
program,'' said Duke Austin, a spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Washington.
   The INS had estimated that 600,000 farm workers would apply under
the program, part of the 1986 immigration act. But the figure topped
1 million by the first week of November, and up to 200,000 more were
expected before the deadline, the INS said.
   Lines formed at many offices Wednesday, and officials said they
were prepared for a last-minute flood of applicants. INS offices
nationwide would stay open until midnight, Austin said.
   Under the initial phase of the immigrant legalization program
that ended May 4, temporary residency was granted to more than 1.7
million illegal aliens who proved continuous residency in the United
States since Jan. 1, 1982.
   Under the farm laborer phase, foreign farmhands must prove they
harvested perishable crops in the United States for a total of at
least 90 days from May 1, 1985, to May 1, 1986. Those accepted will
receive temporary residency status and eventually will be able to
apply for permanent status.
   But many of those unable to prove they worked on farms have
resorted to fraud, leading to a market in forged documents,
officials said.
   ``We actually have developed a complete file system with about 50
people or organizations who are indicated as vendors of fraudulent
documents,'' said Francis Siciliano, acting chief legalization
officer of the Phoenix INS Office, where over 52,000 applications
were expected.
   ``They're going for $100, $200, $300. I've even heard of $2,500
for a packet (of documents),'' he said.
   Austin said one source of these illegal documents are farm labor
contractors who hire illegal immigrants.
   In Liberal, Kan., five people were arrested late Tuesday and
early Wednesday for selling fraudulent employment letters to illegal
aliens, said Ron Sanders, district INS director in Kansas City.
   About 60 percent of the applications filed in Arizona are being
recommended for denial, officials said, but that doesn't mean that
that many will ultimately be rejected. Siciliano said a
recommendation for denial simply means the application needs further
checking.
   In the Northeast, more than 40 percent of the almost 20,000
applications were recommended for denial, said Amy Otten, an INS
spokeswoman in Burlington, Vt.
   Louis D. Crocetti, director of the Baltimore INS office, said
many whose applications were rejected there had tried to pass as
farm workers after missing the May 4 cutoff for non-farm workers.
   ``We've had people who said they picked baked beans or used
ladders to pick cucumbers,'' he said. ``They don't even rehearse
what they're going to say.''
   More than half the applications under the program, or about
500,000, have come from California, followed by Florida with about
10 percent and Texas with about 8 percent, officials said.
Significant numbers have also been filed in the Northwest, Arizona
and New York.
   In New Orleans, applicants were waiting at the door of the INS
office Wednesday morning.
   ``I don't know why people have waited until the last day,'' said
Charles V. Williams, the office's chief legalization officer.
   At the Fresno, Calif., INS office, two illegal aliens explained
their procrastination.
   Francisco Ruiz, 29, said he had great difficulty obtaining his
birth certificate from Mexico. He said he sent for the document in
May but it arrived just two weeks ago.
   Pedro Enriquez said he delayed applying because he didn't have
the money until Wednesday for the $185 application fee.
   The Houston INS office opened at midnight Tuesday to handle the
expected crowds after lines earlier that day stretched around the
block.
   ``We've taken in over 900 people so far,'' Richard Rios, the
office director, said Wednesday morning. ``By midnight, we expect to
have had about 1,500 people in a 24-hour period.''
   The deadline comes without the fanfare of the one in May. During
the last month of that yearlong application period, the INS, as well
as private groups, put out the word on radio, television,
billboards, newspapers and pamphlets.
   Antonio Bustomonte, a legal aid attorney in Phoenix who works
with farm workers, said that ``for every person who applies, there
is at least one more who didn't.''
   The INS ``made no effort to reach farm workers, had no game
plan,'' he said.
   Dick Perry, deputy director of the INS Phoenix district, disputed
Bustomonte's claim and said the agency had done a good job at
spreading the word.
   One illegal alien applying Wednesday for resident status in Lima,
Pa., said receiving the permit was a matter of life and death for
his wife and four children in Mexico.
   ``If I don't, they'll die of hunger,'' said Jose Villagomez, 36,
a mushroom worker in Kennett Square, Pa., who sends money to his
family for food.

<TEXT>
   The Association of Flight Attendants said
Wednesday it was surprised by United Airlines' call for a mediator
in contract talks with the union.
   ``We would say it was premature. The company has been unwilling
to meet very many times this year. We aren't against it, we are just
surprised by it,'' said Cindy Yeast, spokeswoman for the flight
attendants union.
   Chicago-based United requested the mediation in an application
filed with the National Mediation Board on Tuesday.
   ``A mediator has to be selected and dates for new talks agreed
upon. All this takes time,'' said Ms. Yeast.
   United refused comment on the matter.
   ``We never have any comment concerning contract negotiations,''
said United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker.
   United's 13,000 flight attendants rejected a tentative agreement
almost a year ago. New negotiations began in January and employees
continued to work under their old labor pact.
   ``There is no threat of a strike. Airlines are governed by the
Railway Labor Act, which stipulates a number of cooling off periods
and contract extensions,'' Ms. Yeast said.
   Since April, the carrier also has been involved in contract talks
with the Air Line Pilots Association.

   RJR Nabisco Inc.'s management threw the
high-stakes takeover auction for the company into total confusion
Wednesday by boosting its offer to more than $24.3 billion in a
stunning, post-deadline drive to nose out rival bids for the
food-and-tobacco giant.
   The fatter offer from the group led by chief executive F. Ross
Johnson topped its $22.7 billion proposal submitted at 5 p.m.
Tuesday, which was the deadline the company had established for
final bids.
   The move sent RJR's stock roaring higher, partly in anticipation
that the unprecedented auction might be prolonged yet again.
   RJR outside directors conducting the auction said earlier in the
day that they were evaluating all bids and an announcement would
come later. But Johnson's surprise delayed the directors'
deliberations and their intentions were unclear by late Wednesday.
   There also was no word from Johnson's main competitors in the
historic takeover fight, buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co. and the investment firm First Boston Corp.
   But sources familiar with the bidding said they understood
Kohlberg also may have raised its offer after the deadline in a
frantic effort to stay in the race. Those sources said Johnson's
group may have raised its offer even higher, to as much as $24.75
billion. Neither report could be confirmed.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, also
said First Boston was still in the auction, contrary to some reports
that said it had withdrawn.
   The sources said First Boston's bid was valued at between $103
and $115 a share, or $23.17 billion and $25.87 billion, but was
considered more tentative than the others and given practically no
chance of success.
   They said that before Johnson's last-minute offer, Kohlberg
appeared to be the winner with its own sweetened bid of more than
$23.1 billion. Kohlberg was so confident it had triumphed that the
firm's senior officers were said to be standing by to arrange press
interviews.
   The events led many speculators and securities analysts watching
the biggest takeover fight in history to conclude that it wasn't
over.
   ``We've got an auction going,'' said John Maxwell, a strategist
at Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va. ``If you were an RJR
director, would you say everything is closed, goodbye? I don't see
how they can really close it down for a while. They don't have to
decide right away. There's no rule.''
   Although Johnson's move came as a surprise, it wasn't
inconsistent with the unpredictable takeover brawl that already has
smashed all records and raised major concerns about the frenzied
level of dealmaking on Wall Street.
   The management group said in a brief statement that it was
prepared to offer $108 a share for the company, vs. the $101 a share
offer submitted Tuesday, $100 a share offer of Nov. 18, $84 a share
offer of Nov. 4 and $75-a-share opening salvo Oct. 20 that
precipitated the takeover struggle.
   The group said the latest offer included $84 a share in cash,
preferred stock it valued at $20 and additional preferred stock it
valued at $4, convertible into 15 percent of the common stock in the
acquired company.
   Johnson's group also promised unspecified protection to RJR's
employees and said they were prepared to further negotiate ``all
aspects of their proposal, including price.''
   Sources familiar with the Kohlberg bid said it was worth $103 a
share, vs. its earlier $94-a-share offer. The cash component of the
latest bid was said to be about $95.
   A crucial element of each proposal is the portion of cash each
bidder intends to pay, because the value of the securities segment
is difficult to determine. These securities often are worth less
than their face amount.
   RJR stock surged in frantic New York Stock Exchange trading and
the Big Board briefly halted it when buy orders overwhelmed sell
orders. The stock resumed trading by midafternoon and closed up
$2.25 to $93 on volume exceeding 6.7 million shares.
   RJR stock was trading at less than $56 a share when the battle
began in late October.
   Johnson's group incited the battle in October when he proposed to
take the nation's 19th-largest industrial company private by
borrowing massive amounts of money to acquire all RJR shares, a
transaction known as a leveraged buyout.
   RJR's board of directors then put the company up for sale to
attract rival bids and conducted the first round of an auction Nov.
18-20. They decided to prolong it because the offers received were
too vague and inadequate.
   Based in Atlanta, RJR is one of the largest consumer products
companies, with more than 120,000 employees. It makes well-known
brands that range from Camel cigarettes to Shredded Wheat cereal to
Life Savers mints.

   The Federal Trade Commission ended its
antitrust probe of the proposed $12.6 billion merger of Philip
Morris Cos. Inc. and Kraft Inc. on Wednesday, after news reports
that it was still investigating the deal generated widespread
investor concern.
   The commission formally ended its probe a day after the mandatory
waiting period for the takeover ended.
   Normally, closing an antitrust investigation is a routine matter
attracting little public attention. The two companies had issued a
statement Tuesday that the legal waiting period had ended without
the government challenging their merger plans.
   But, at a routine press briefing on Wednesday, FTC Chairman
Daniel Oliver and agency officials declined to discuss details of
the case, stating that they could not comment because the matter
remained open.
   That sparked speculation that the agency might be preparing to
take action against the planned takeover and prompted officials to
call news media to clarify their position. And the full commission
met by the end of the day and voted to close the matter.
   ``It's fairly routine to keep investigations open beyond
the...waiting period, ending the waiting period doesn't mean the
investigation is auotmatically closed,'' said Patrick M. Sheller, an
aide to Oliver.
   But Sheller and FTC spokeswoman Anna Davis stressed that keeping
the investigation open did not indicate any action was pending.
   When large companies plan to merge they must inform the
commission and Justice Department and then wait 30 days before
completing the action to give the government time to act if it deems
the marger anticompetitive.
   But even after a merger is completed the commission still can
take legal action to undo the combination.
   Sheller said the normal procedure is for the staff to come to the
five-member commission at some point with a recommendation on
whether to approve the merger. Then the commission itself votes on
that recommendation and either commences lagal action or sends the
companies a formal notice closing the investigation.

<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc. on Wednesday sweetened
its buyout offer for Holly Farms Corp., but made completion of the
deal contingent on the elimination of key terms of Holly Farms'
merger with ConAgra Inc.
   The nation's biggest poultry processor boosted its cash tender
offer to $54 a share, or about $1.1 billion for Holly Farms' 20.4
million outstanding common shares and equivalents, from $52 a share,
or about $1.06 billion.
   Tyson stated in a letter to the board of Memphis, Tenn.-based
Holly Farms that the offer was subject to termination or
invalidation of Holly Farms' agreement to sell ConAgra some of its
prize assets if acquired by a third company, such as Tyson, and to
pay ConAgra a ``bustup fee'' if their deal fell through.
   Tyson also offered to pay cash and stock it valued at $57 a share
for control of Holly Farms under a two-step buyout if the company
terminated its merger with ConAgra and negotiated a new agreement
with Tyson.
   The company said it remained willing to revise its new proposals
and threatened to put the latest offers directly before shareholders
if Holly Farms continued its refusal to negotiate.
   A Holly Farms spokesman at the company's headquarters was said to
be unavailable for comment. ConAgra spokesman Walt Casey said the
latest Tyson offer ``doesn't change our expectations of being able
to acquire'' Holly Farms. ConAgra has valued its proposal for Holly
Farms at about $1 billion.
   Holly Farms has rejected Tyson's previous takeover offers and on
Nov. 16 agreed to a stock swap merger with Omaha, Neb.-based ConAgra
that the Holly Farms board valued at $59.25 a share. That merger
with Holly Farms, the nation's second-largest poultry processor,
would make ConAgra the nation's biggest poultry concern.
   In agreeing to the merger, Holly Farms granted ConAgra a
so-called ``lockup option'' to buy key Holly Farms assets in the
event a third company acquires Holly Farms. It also agreed to pay
ConAgra a $15 million ``bustup fee'' if their merger falls through.
   Tyson is challenging those provision in Delaware Chancery Court,
and in Wednesday's letter again attacked them as reflecting a
bidding process that ``was a sham calculated to deliver Holly Farms
at any price to the bidder favored by management.''
   ``We ask that you consider our increased tender offer price and
our merger proposal...in light of certain undeniable facts _ namely
that the lock-up option and the termination fee provisions resulted
from a process which was neither fair nor an auction and clearly was
not intended to maximize value for Holly Farms stockholders,''
Chairman Don Tyson said in the letter.
   Holly Farms stock closed at $53.50 a share, up $1 in New York
Stock Exchange trading. Tyson dipped 50 cents a share to $15.50 in
national over-the-counter trading.
   Under the two-step transaction Tyson proposed, it would pay $53
cash and one-quarter share of Tyson stock, worth about $3.87{ at
Wednesday's price, for 93 percent of Holly Farms' outstanding
shares, or about 18.98 million shares. The remaining shares would be
converted into 3.56 shares of Tyson stock, worth $55.18 based on
Wednesday's price, in a subsequent merger.
   If its amended tender offer is accepted, Tyson said it could be
in position to close the deal as early as Dec. 16, when the offer is
scheduled to expire. The second step could be completed early next
year, Tyson said.
   Tyson also demanded that it be furnished all written information
furnished to ConAgra.

<HEAD>Texaco Agrees to Plead Guilty, Pay $750,000 for Offshore Drilling
Violation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. agreed Wednesday to plead guilty
to federal felony charges stemming from failure to test safety
equipment on an offshore oil rig and pay a $750,000 fine.
   The company's Texaco USA subsidiary was charged, along with a
former oil rig supervisor and a drilling contractor, with delaying
for two days a required weekly test of a device that prevents deadly
blowouts of pressurized natural gas during drilling.
   ``This certainly signals our commitment to see that offshore
drilling operations are conducted safely and legally,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Janet Goldstein, a member of the Justice
Department's environmental crime section who is prosecuting the case.
   It is the first criminal prosecution under provisions of the
offshore drilling act that took effect in 1978, she said.
   No accident or other damage took place because of the testing
delays at the company's Platform Harvest off the California coast in
December 1986, Texaco said. The company blamed the violations on the
supervisor, who was fired.
   A criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court charges Texaco
with two counts of violating the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act _
one count for each day the test was delayed.
   Robert R. Brogdin, 48, of Bakersfield, a former supervisor on the
platform 11 miles off Point Conception, also was charged with two
counts of violating the act.
   Texaco, which could be fined up to $1 million, agreed to pay
$750,000 in a plea bargain filed simultaneously with the charges.
Brogdin, who could be imprisoned for 20 years and fined $500,000,
also pleaded guilty but prosecutors didn't make a sentencing
recommendation.
   In a separate indictment returned Wednesday by a federal grand
jury, the contractor, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co.
of Tulsa, Okla., was charged with six counts of violating the act,
said Ms. Goldstein. Two counts concern the delayed test and four
other counts stem from alleged falsification of documents on earlier
tests of the blowout preventer.
   The company, which also has a Ventura office, declined to
negotiate a plea, she said.
   Calls to Helmerich & Payne's California office Wednesday evening
rang unanswered and an employee who answered the phone in Tulsa
refused to call a spokesman at home. Brogdin isn't listed in the
Bakersfield directory.
   Blowouts occur during drilling when equipment cannot contain
pressurized natural gas that is found along with oil deposits under
the seabed. A blowout would imperil the oil rig crew and could cause
an environmentally disastrous spill, Ms. Goldstein said.
   According to Texaco, Brogdin allowed Helmerich & Payne to delay
tests of the blowout preventer Dec. 29 and 30, 1986, because of an
equipment problem. Tests are required every seven days under the
drilling act, which is administered by the Interior Department's
Minerals Management Service.
   Higher Texaco officials learned of the violations Jan. 6, 1987
and fired Brogdin 10 days later, said Robert Hammond, a spokesman in
the company's Universal City office.
   Investigations by the Minerals Management Service and the Justice
Department support Texaco's contention that it didn't condone such
behavior, Hammond said.
   The platform is off Point Conception, 125 miles north of Los
Angeles.

   Westinghouse Electric Corp., bracing for an
expected lawsuit by the Philippines, said Wednesday the dispute
stems from politically motivated opposition to the nuclear power
plant it built under former President Ferdinand Marcos.
   The government of President Corazon Aquino has said it plans to
sue Westinghouse for damages and breach of contract regarding the
$2.3 billion plant, which never went into operation because of
alleged safety defects.
   A formal announcement of the suit was scheduled in Manila for
2:30 p.m. local time (1:30 a.m. EST) at the presidential palace.
   The government says the plant, 60 miles northwest of Manila in
Bataan province, is unsafe partly because of its design and its
location on an earthquake fault and near a volcano.
   The reactor's opponents also allege that bribes were paid over
the awarding of the prime contract for the plant.
   ``What we're finding here are the results of a political policy
that came to life when they were running for office,'' said
Nathaniel D. Woodson, general manager of the Westinghouse nuclear
fuels unit. ``They now feel they have a political albatross around
their neck and they're trying to blame us.''
   President Aquino's legal adviser, Adolfo Azcuna, said in late
October that the suit was ready and likely would be filed within a
month in the United States.
   In addition, a standstill agreement barring either the government
or the company from taking legal action, was to expire Thursday.
   Woodson and Deputy General Counsel Louis J. Briskman said
Philippines officials have acknowledged during private talks that no
matter how safe the plant is, they don't intend to allow nuclear
power production in the country.
   With all but $20 million to $30 million still due from Manila for
the power plant, Westinghouse could walk away from the 10-year-old
controversy, said Woodson. The bigger risk could be damage to the
company's international standing as a designer and builder of
nuclear power plants.
   ``All over the world we have built plants, and we haven't had
this problem. If they don't want to operate this plant, that's their
decision, but don't make Westinghouse a scapegoat,'' he said.
``Westinghouse will not be a scapegoat.''
   The company cites investigations by the U.S. Justice Department
and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which produced no
evidence to warrant charges.
   A safety study commissioned by the Aquino government _ a draft of
which was published by a trade journal _ concluded that the plant is
safe, Westinghouse said. But the government says the final report
concludes otherwise, although officials have refused to release the
document.
   The 620-megawatt plant, powered by a Westinghouse pressurized
water reactor, was completed three years ago.
   The project early on was shaken by allegations of kickbacks to
officials of the Marcos regime and by safety concerns.
   Communist rebels have bombed the transmission towers leading from
the plant, and people have cut and sold the copper lines as scrap.
The plant's corps of operators has largely disbanded, and
Westinghouse has only a handful of employees still in the
Philippines, Woodson said.
   Furthermore, the cost of the plant continues rising, Westinghouse
said. Interest on the loans the Philippines government took to build
the plant cost an estimated $300,000 per day.

   Pillsbury Co. said Wednesday it has sent a
letter to Grand Metropolitan PLC Chairman Allen Sheppard saying that
a $60-a-share takeover offer is inadequate and a meeting between
officials of the two companies would, therefore, ``serve no
purpose.''
   ``Following many hours of study, with the advice and assistance
of four respected financial advisers, the board has unanimously
determined that your $60-per-share offer is financially inadequate
and not in the best interests of Pillsbury and its shareholders,''
Philip L. Smith, Pillsbury's chairman and chief executive officer,
said in the letter.
   ``This conclusion is confirmed not only by Pillsbury's own
internal analysis and the advice of its financial advisors, but also
by the advice of your advisers who have put values in the high $60s
to low $70s on Pillsbury in documents that were disclosed publicly
in open court by your counsel,'' Smith wrote.
   Sheppard responded, in a letter Wednesday to Smith, by
reiterating his desire for a meeting and contending that Pillsbury's
characterization of Grand Met's offer as inadequate was flawed.
   Sheppard called the offer ``at the high end of the range of fair
values for Pillsbury'' based on analysis by Grand Met's investment
advisers, and noted that Pillsbury's advisers variously have valued
the company in the $50 a share range.
   Grand Met, a British liquor, gambling and speciality products
conglomerate, launched its $5.23 billion hostile takeover bid Oct.
4. Pillsbury's board of directors has rejected it as inadequate and
has refused to meet with Sheppard.
   In a Nov. 22 letter to Smith, Sheppard said Grand Met would like
a ``full and frank discussion'' with Pillsbury executives of Grand
Met's all-cash offer.
   Sheppard told Smith that although he has ``no reason to believe
that our $60-per-share offer is not fair and fully priced, I remain
prepared to negotiate all aspects of the proposal, including price.''
   In his response, Smith told Sheppard, ``Your reluctance to
provide a higher offer cannot be excused by saying you won't bid
against yourself. The Pillsbury board will only endorse an offer for
Pillsbury which reflects the values inherent in the company. Your
current offer does not.''
   On Monday, Hennepin County District Judge Thomas Carey took under
advisement renewed arguments from a Pillsbury shareholders group on
its request to have Pillsbury's ``poison pill'' defense invalidated,
force Pillsbury to negotiate with Grand Met and block the
Minneapolis-based food and restaurant company's planned spinoff of
its Burger King fast-food subsidiary.
   In his letter, Smith said, ``Our board's review of Pillsbury's
and Burger King's potential has confirmed that now is not an
appropriate time to sell Pillsbury, and that if the company were to
be sold in the future as two separate companies, substantially
greater values could be realized.''
   Smith concluded, ``The Pillsbury board remains committed to
value. Simply put, your $60-per-share offer does not represent the
values which the Pillsbury shareholders deserve. As long as the
framework for a meeting between ourselves is an inadequate offer
which you persist in claiming is fair and fully priced, a meeting
would serve no purpose.''
   Grand Met has said a separate Burger King would create a huge tax
liability for Grand Met if the takeover is successful. In addition,
Burger King franchisees have announced opposition to the plan,
saying it would add too much debt to the already troubled fast-food
chain.
   Grand Met on Monday extended its offer for a fifth time. The
tender offer now will expire at midnight EST Friday unless extended
again. By last Saturday, 85.3 percent of Pillsbury's outstanding
shares had been tendered and not withdrawn, Grand Met said.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower, Stocks Higher In Tokyo Morning Session</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with morning Nikkei closing, later

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar declined against the Japanese yen in
Thursday morning trading, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main
market indicator rose to new highs.
   In midmorning trading, the dollar was changing hands at 121.52
yen after opening at 121.28 yen, down 0.57 yen from Wednesday's
close.
   The dollar fell Wednesday in New York after the Bank of England
put in a large sell order in an attempt to prevent the British pound
from rising against the West German mark, dealers said, effectively
pushing the dollar down.
   In Tokyo, market players were inclined to remain on the sidelines
ahead of the release of U.S. November unemployment figures,
scheduled for Friday in Washington, said a dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo.
   ``The dollar rose slightly after some trading companies bought
the currency for their payments, but the dollar-yen rate was not
moving very much,'' said the dealer, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which rose
260.60 points to a record close on Wednesday, gained another 94.26
points to finish morning trading at 29,673.16.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose after an overnight
gain by the Dow Jones' industrial average in New York, dealers said.
   Market participants' buying interest helped boost share prices
despite some selling by traders attempting to cash in gains made
over the last two days, said a dealer with a major securities firm
in Tokyo.
   He said many investors believed there was less likelihood that
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board would raise its interest rates and
that in turn contributed to the stock-buying interest.
